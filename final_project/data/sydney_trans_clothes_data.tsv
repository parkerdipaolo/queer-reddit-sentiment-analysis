The other day I went to my cousins house, and she did my makeup for the first time and handed some of her clothes. I had never been happier in my life. I'm still discovering myself, but this feels so good.		"Aww that’s so nice! I’d like to borrow your cousin
You’re so pretty!!  Also the Junji Ito shirt is awesome!
If I passed you on the street looking like this, I'd absolutely think you were an AFAB woman.
Lookin good!
My mom use to dress me and my little brother the same . She put him in my clothes almost up to school age ..... he still raids my closet 😊

Is that you or your cousin in the picture. 

If it's you then you look absolutely incredible for someone who's so close to the start of their transition (or, just, for a woman in general)

You fuckin’ rock these!
how to pretty pls teach
You’re gorgeous ;-; and would pass with ease, I dream to look as good as you do
I'm happy to read this story, I think about this issue often. It hurts my heart that ppl are so close-minded that they would actually risk their child harming themselves out of fear and the feeling of lonliness. Loving and careing for someone shouldn't have to praised. But in 2021 we are talking about basic human kindness as if it's out of the ordinary. This is why we as a race if ppl need to be proactive about these issues we've treated as if they would just fade away. It's not gonna happen like that, we have to speak our truths NOW!!!
You look absolutely gorgeous! Kudos to your cousin for helping out :)
For real. I want a cousin like OP’s sooo fucking bad. Like, c’mon, god.. gimme just *one* non-queerphobic family member who will not only accept me for who I am, but also help me be who I want to be..
Thanks! That's the only piece of this outfit that I own
(Guessing ur still questioning by the ""still discovering myself"" in the title)
It was already stained with makeup and food that we had eaten, and she told me not to worry c:
Awww, thank you sweetie!
I'm still trying to figure out the makeup thing... it's hard to find decent guides or videos that don't make you look like a drag queen... I have no one to teach me
Haha, no worries, those are two photos of a few hundred we took c:

Just received a bunch of men’s clothing and a bible for Christmas.	title. I’m MtF, out to them and have been for a while so this just feels like a slap in the face. They’ve never done something like this before and it really hurt me.	"Give them away to a thrift store.  Or if you know a trans man that could use the clothes, give them to him.
If it's an option, stop coming to Christmas. Fuck that. Just tell them you'll send a postcard from hell.
As if they could defeat you with mere paper and fabric. You are a more powerful being than they can imagine- that's why they have to turn to God for hope, and even he can't save them from the glorious light of your truth.
I’m so sorry that happened to you! If they don’t respect your identity than there’s no reason to give them any respect, family or not. And they’ll wonder why you don’t talk to them as a thriving grown woman :)
Highlight all the passages about unconditional love, holding judgments and grace. Then give it to them next Christmas with a note that if they want a relationship with you that they should take a page from Jesus’s teachings and apply them . You can let them know that you made it conveniently easy with highlighted passages.
I’d slap whomever gave me that bible with that bible.
My mom gave me a bible too when i tried suicide. I know the context is different, but i burnt that fucking book to ashes

See, they will never understand our world, as they do not eager to wear our shoes, wich is straight not what Jesus or whatsoever wanted them to. People who live like this, only follow the bible in the parts that are good for them, that bennefits them. And wants other to follow everthing, wich they dont.
Thats when i would start buying dildos and strapons for everyone in the family.💀give them a real reason to think you need jesus 💀💀
I love the idea of giving the clothes to someone that can use them.  Just trash the Bible.
Re-sewthe clothes and turn them into skirts and stuff!
Well if it were me I’d send them a video of the clothes and bible burning in my front yard, along with a Merry Fucking Christmas caption.  But I’m older and don’t live with relatives.  Maybe give the stuff away or toss it?  Since you’re 16, you’ll have to put up with shit like this a couple more years.  Start making your exit plan now for the day you turn 18.  Whatever it takes to live independently.  You don’t want people like that holding you hostage.
Thats just insulting. Clearly a message behind it. If you can, minimize contact ( I read you live with them so thats about as extreme as you can get) because if they cant accept you, why should they be able to enjoy your company?
Depending on where you live, there might be a donation center specifically for trans men and women. You can donate them and maybe pick up some stuff you actually want. 

Alternatively, there are places you can sell them (assuming you can’t return it for a full refund) and again, get something you want. 

As for the Bible, well… personally I would just throw it in the garbage. If religion is your thing then I guess do what you want with it. If you feel bad about throwing it away then you can just “lose it” next time you’re at church.
Have they read the Bible? Its like game of thrones. Two sisters got their dad drunk so they could fuck him and get pregnant. Where's the moral there?
Set up a poshmark account and sell them so you can raise money for the cute clothes you’re interested in! I’m so sorry that you have to go through this, but when life gives you lemons…
Return them and buy women’s clothes and an atheist book (unless you’re still Christian in which case just buy a trans book).
Regift them back next christmas
I was given a beard kit I a month into HRT MTF I hate Xmas .. my wife was only who got me some makeup sponges and showed me how to use them it was sweetest gift .. that n the series x she got me lol yes I’m an old girl gamer
Take it from me, I'm a trans Christian & there's nothing in that book that will ""cure"" you

Because there's nothing to cure. There's plenty in there that'll help you come to terms with yourself though.

Like 1 Samuel 16:7 reads:

""But the Lord said to Samuel, 'Do not look at his appearance or at his physical stature, because I have refused him. For the Lord does not see as man sees; for man looks at the outward appearance, but the Lord looks at the heart.'""

It's basically telling me that since my heart is in the right place, I'm getting into His good grace. And the massive blessings I've received ever since coming out this year & especially in the last month or so, tells me that... YES 🙏 he still looking out 4 me, even tho I'm transgender (which held me back soooo long!)

Humans will never understand one another! ❤️ Should you choose, there's a God in heaven that will 😉 Amen?
Donate the clothes and burn the bible. But burn it so they see it 👌
Burn them or straight up tell them that ""No, actually you don't like them at all"" when they ask
Burn them
(I’m a multi spiritual kinda person and I like the Bible, not most Christians tho, but that’s such a fucked up gesture i’d literally burn them all I think it’d be liberating)
Reading this post and all the comments make me want to give everyone hugs. Not like that would take away the pain or really help, but 🫂
It is a slap in the face. 

If you can return the clothing.

Get yourself a highlighter because you can give them that book back next Christmas. Or wait until you move out… things like “love one another as I have loved you” and “Love is patient, love is KIND” or the “speck in your brothers eye “

Cherry pickers sometimes need that.

So sorry
This is weaponizing the Bible in a way God did not intend. Shame on them. It’s “Christians” like them that give us a bad reputation.
MtF here, I got a bible from my mom with a note on the front cover. ""John 8:24 You will die in your sins unless you believe in jesus."" 

Merry christmas to you too.
Are there any trans guys that go to your school that would be happy with the clothes? Even a tomboy who's parents won't buy them boy stuff. Or a kid you know who's family is struggling and could use some new clothes. You might be able to talk to the guidance councilor and if there is someone trans or in  need give it through the councilor to protect their anonymity
Gift them back dildos and dietary books next year
Just leave the stuff in a common area or under the tree and if they put it in your room put it back. They’ll get the picture pretty quickly. And if they fuss a out it just tell them you’re really disappointed in them, and say nothing else.
Burn the book, donate the clothes to your local trans clothing exchange.

Or if you're from a rural area or small town, just a generic local charity.
Wow, it hurts but maybe it's a good time to start new Christmas traditions.
Sell the clothes and the bible and buy yourself a better present with the money
Burn them
Throw it all out in the trash.
Burn them
BURN THE BIBLE  
BURN IT  
BURN THE BIBLE
In the Spirit of Christmas, give them to charity
Sell it so you can buy women’s clothes from the money, or swap in one of those trans clothing schemes
Cut out the inside of the bible and hide your weeds in there.
This is the kind of things family do, that then later when the kid grows up and the said young adult moves out, family members will wonder why they don't ever come and visit them?
Don’t know how a parent (especially a purported Christian) could use Christmas as an opportunity to be passive aggressive and snarky to their child.  It’s beyond me.  OP, sorry you’re going through this right now.  But remind yourself that this is not permanent. Stay strong and take care of yourself.  Leave the “gifts” under the tree and ignore them.
Put them back under the tree with a note

"" Hey Santa. I think you sent these presents to the wrong kid""

Your parents will get the message. Passive Aggressive just like they are.
Thrift it all and make new, cute clothes.
I’m here from r/all and I’d just like to say if you actually read that Bible you would definitely be more of a Christian than this person who clearly hasnt read a single page. The first half is pretty metal if thats at all motovational 🤘
Sounds like a good time to thank them for the bible as when times are tough you can read it and be reminded that Jesus preached acceptance of others for who they were and not how others wanted them to be. Ask them what time dinner is and is there a theme as you'll ick out the best frock you have to match it - watch them choke on their turkey.
Fuck them. That's so fucking mean. I almost provided spiteful revenge ideas, but i don't think that will help you. Donate the men's clothes, recycle or burn the bible, and set boundaries with them that you're sure you can follow through on
burn them.
That is sooo shitty. My advise is to just ignore them or try to make the clothes ”girly” and thank them for the pretty clothes. Also donate or burn the bible hehe. I was luckly and got nice gifts but nobody knew my real name…
My families slowly getting better with that. I’m also 16 btw. I still got skin care stuff, but a mix of men and womens brands, mainly men tho. It’s a step in the right direction. I also got clothes, a few shirts. But all video game related so gender neutral. I wish you the best
your bigger than them. you have shown a courage that they will never understand. allow these types of experiences to make you stronger. blessings.
I’m really sorry they did this to you. That’s really freaking rotten. I wish we could do a Shitty Trans Christmas Swap—“They got you girl stuff? They got me boy stuff. Sizes?” If you’re on Instagram, would you want to sign up for @transanta?

Second, I know religious talk is triggering for a lot of folks. I haven’t wrapped my head around how to black out text, so I’ll leave space . . . 



God is queer. Your transness is *sacred*. Your girlhood is *sacred*. Queerness is infinite and complex, and that’s what God is. You are a precious part of the INFINITE divine, and anyone who says there’s no room in divinity for queerness? Is too afraid to know the real. They squash God flat so it’ll fit into their narrow little minds. But you are far closer to the real truth of God than they will *ever* be.
 Donate the clothes to charity. Highlight lines in the bible about not-judging , gods love for all people, and charity. 

So sorry they are doing this to you.
Id've pulled out a lighter and set that bible on fire right then and there.
Cut them into booty shorts and crop tops

Do any kind of Instagram diy bullshit modification you can to get fem clothes and thank them next time you wear it
Respond with, ""ah a firestarter and some clothes to donate to the homeless! Thanks""
Burn the shit right in front of them lol
That really angers me. Especially when they already know…
Not trans but what the duck is wrong with those people
Agreed just leave it under the tree,….. or even better burn them outside 😂
Bible pages make great rolling paper
If you have any transmasc friends, maybe consider giving the dysphoric clothing to them? As for the bible… have a lighter handy?
Sell it online and get the billing in paper to your adress
OP... you should definitely go donate all of those and leave the donation receipt on the counter.
Next year hand them some Pagan or Satanic things and clothing traditionally not corresponding to their genders
Crop the mens clothes into cool shit, and then burn the Bible
Not sure if you personally are Christian but, if you are, here’s a verse you can use that Bible for


Galatians 3:28

“There is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, **nor is there male and female,** for you are all one in Christ Jesus.”
Burn it all
What kind of men's clothing is it? Because if you can then I'd find a way to make it semi feminine. Hoodie? Crop it. Any graphic tees? Crop them or cut the sides into slits or smth.

Obviously it won't work for all types of clothing but if you can find a way to feminize it then go for it so that they can see that they can't tear you down.

I'm really sorry this happened though, I hope things gets better. I'm always open ears if you need someone to message! Stay safe and just keep being you. You've got this 🤍🌿
If you smoke weed most Bibles are great for rolling joints😉
I learned this lesson as a young Black ice hockey player from an white opponent player who called Me the ""n"" word all season ...from a major influence in My life...He said..

""... It doesn't matter what names people call you.... What DOES matter is what name you ANSWER to...""

 What weapons others can use against you ..using your deadnames ...giving you anything in opposition to your identity....they will indeed use it in the mistaken hope they can change you to their way and want 

until you take it away from them by not responding in the way they want you to... 

And just be the real you and live your truth.  You're not some crazy person or a monster... you're just being you

I'm not trans but I hope this helps and this is appropriate here.
""thanks for sending me stuff to take too the men's shelter. Ps thanks for the book too. My Satanist blood orgy table was wobbling, the book fits right under the abortion leg.""
Sending love to you! That does sound painful. How did you react? Did you feel safe sharing your hurt?
Burn the bible in front of them
Sell them to or donate them to other trans folks.  Circle of life, baby.
Find a local trans support group and donate the clothing to them. And ask for a card addressed to the original gifter for the gift to help less fortunate trans people
Burn it.
Just saw the 16 years old part and I am so sorry. While it might seem like forever, 2 years will pass quicker than you think. Hang in there, there's a whole world out here waiting to love and appreciate you for who YOU are. Hugs.
- Rampant Momma Bear Ally
Make a video of you burning it and send it to them!

Or donate them to a trans man if you know any who are looking for clothing. But still burn that damn book.
Ugh I hate when family does that. My mom did the same thing to me by getting the most feminine clothes for me even though I've been out her her since 8th grade 😒
Wow this is absolutely awful, I genuinely want to cry when I think of how you must have felt. You are a woman, and no one can deny that truth, whether they acceot it as such or not.
Burn it, send them the video.
I just wanna say that Jesus loves everyone, and I’m sorry that your family is not supportive.
As for the bible I would read it and highlight every passage that shows why your parents are wrong in the way they are treating you, the. Give it back to them highlighted. God says to love everyone , they are just trying to use religion to back what they want to believe
Anytime they say anything against you say “thou shall not judge” or use something straight out of the Bible that can be turned against them
I don’t believe in the Bible so I can’t help with the wording but maybe someone else can help with what you can use to make them STFU
I was like yay! cloths for an ftm... bible?? oh no.. mtf. whatever they're trying to do won't work. you are who you are and you know that ma'am, rock it
Donate them to a local LGBT friendly shelter
""Return to sender <deadname> not known at this address""   (passive aggressive)  
It's just very sad you still live with them. I hope you have a safe and healthy place soon.  Ideally by other people realizing they were dicks.  But wish in one hand and spit in the other.  See which fills up first.  
I'm so sorry you had to go through this mate.  This is bullshit and you are allowed to be angry, upset and any other emotion you want.  
Please take care.
Make lingerie out of the Bible pages?
You have a fireplace? Then you know what to do
Sorry about your family. Find someone that's FtM that could use them and a wobbly table.
Sell them on eBay and use the money to buy yourself something nice
Op, I'm sorry your family is treating you this way.  You have received a lot of suggestions to tell them to fuck off, and if you can, absolutely do.  

But I also understand that you might not want to set the bridges on fire between you and them.  

I got misgendered and deadnamed this Christmas.  It still hurts, 9 years after coming out.  

I still go to family events.  They don't give me masculine clothes and gifts anymore.  Some of them haven't misgendered me in 8 years.  

They are all my family.  They have shown their love in different ways and while that doesn't change the hurt, the hurt doesn't change the love either.  

So I hope your family comes to understanding and acceptance and stops being deliberately hurtful.  But even if not, I hope you find the strength to make the best decisions for yourself and your well being.  You deserve respect.  You can build a life where you are respected as well as loved.
Give them to an FTM friend and donate the Bible to the salvation army
I'm so sorry this happened to you. How insensitive and down right mean. My Granddaughter is FTM and we sent her a Christmas card that say's to our Grandson. Needless to say he was over the moon happy. We don't get to choose who we love let alone accept who we want. I hope that you parents wake up to that fact. You're their Child no matter what and the need to love you unconditionally. ❤️💕 Merry Christmas to you. 🎄🎄❤️
Well I think the right response depends on how you are as a person. If you want to show them you’re not having any of their shit then leave the gifts and never take them. If you want to be the better person and spread Christmas cheer then donate them to people who need clothes this cold season. And if you wanna out do them then either A throw the stuff out in the main garbage bin right at the top (not recommend, starts fights and is wasteful) or just take the clothes and modify them a little. Make a sweater off the shoulder by messing with the collar, make trousers into capris or something idk. Just my recommendation is to not start any unnecessary fights given that you live with these people and as much as you may hate what they did (and even them I wouldn’t blame you) they are still currently who you live with so try not to make your life actively worse. Just my opinion Which of course means nothing.
If your parents have a yard, kerosene can be found in the camping isle and will light up anything in nothing flat. Burn them while staring them down
Idk if you enjoy crafting by any means, but there are tons of awesome techniques to turn mens clothing into awesome fashionable womens clothes! I’ve tried mostly dresses and fancy tops, but there are so many out there, I strongly recommend looking into it!

I'm so sorry your family disrespect you like this and wish there where more I could do than words of encouragement from a stranger on the Internet. I have to wonder, why would parents do this? Because it's clearly meant to hurt you, it goes beyond just ignoring the subject and pretending everything is as it used to be. Are they really thinking hurting you will make you change your mind and not cut them out of their life as soon as possible.
I'm sorry your family is behaving like asshats. I hope they will understand why this is wrong but sometimes they never will. Just know there is a whole world of people out there who support you and you to see you become who you were meant to be. Sending love
Read the bible, and highlight all the passage where it says to not be a dick. Then give it back next Christmas.
wrap yourself some girly presents and address them to your chosen name and put them under the tree when your family aren't watching. perfect way to feel validated and also spread dissent among the transphobes  
edit: also burn the bible in front of them lol :p
What an emotional hate crime! I am so sorry that you have to be surrounded by such blatant bigotry, and hopefully you'll find a safe way to change your situation.
Gift them idk some real ungodly shit next christmas. And some thrifted clothes that arent for their gender. G
Make or find a trans pride 🏳️‍⚧️ book cover for your Bible
I'm so sorry OP, that's just gross. That's not okay, and it's super shitty that your fam did that. Sending love 💜
*Hugs*
Did they highlight Deuteronomy 22:5 too?
I'm sorry you were ""gifted"" such mean presents. I love the idea of donating the clothes to someone in need. Maybe a shelter could use them. Either throw away the Bible or leave it in the living room. Whichever you're more comfortable with.

Know there are people here who support you.
This WAS a slap to the face.  Slap back by having a ceremonial burning of the shitty gifts in the front yard.
Modify the men’s clothings to be girl’s ones. Make the shirts crop tops, make the jeans cute shorts. Use the leftovers to make patches or smth lol
That's really awful, i'm sorry they did that! I hope you'll feel better! 

Make use of the clothes, give it away, or bedazzzle the shit out of the clothes! 
If you can sew, sew in those jeans and men's shirts so they give more figure. Cut out all the big pockets, because we all know women's clothing don't have big pockets..
Or maybe tie-dye all those boring t-shirts, bleach dark blue jeans, buy fabric glue and glue diamons on, buy fabric pens and write wholesome shit on them. 
Give back that slap in the face with style!

And the bible, maybe use a highlighter on every script out of love and acceptance? It's not the religion that cast away people, people do.
That's fucked up.

The gift of men's clothing was clearly not even meant for you to like it, sadly enough. 

I like the idea of twisting that into something you can still appreciate.

 ""I can donate this to trans-friendly this-or-that!"" Or, ""These will fit my partner perfectly!"" Eh, I'm at a loss for a golden clever example.
> this just feels like a slap in the face

I mean, yeah. They're making it clear that they don't respect you or your identity. That's really shitty. 

If you're able to cut ties with them, I'd recommend it. They seem pretty insistent on treating you like shit.
Anyone have book suggestions to gift back, ""reconciling"" Christianity with being transgender/LGBTQ?
I wish I could devote these jerk people. That’s really mean.
Shiiiiit. Saw some of your other replies; how long have you been out?
Cool, you got fuel for the xmas fire!
Hey, free toilet paper 🤷‍♀️
Just thank them for the Bible and let them know reading the it turned you heathen!
Are you religious? If not, go with it! Tell them god said he accepts you just as you are (or som like that) and he also yold you to donate the male clothes. Who the hell are they to tell if god accepts you or not?
At one point I would have held my toung, but if it happened today I would have burned them and left the ashes on the doorstep. It's dumb how people think stuff like that is a good idea, and I wouldn't hesitate to show them.
I’m sorry hun.. that’s a cruel move them. I hope the rest of your holiday season is filled with the prettiest dresses and skirts!
Hang in there, bide your time until you can get away from them. You got this 💪
Send the clothing to a homeless shelter or something, and the Bible for kindling for the Christmas fire.
Assholes
Why not gift exchange it with someone who received nothing for Christmas? I hate to be that internet person, but you can chalk this one up as a first world problem. Nobody is entitled to receive gifts, that’s what makes them gifts.

Of course I’m not suggesting you must thank your family for these gifts, however you can always redirect a bad intention into a good one.
It might just be my weird way of reacting to hostility but i'd laugh my ass off if I got anything even close to this, it's just so nonsensical to me
Burn the Bible. It's up to you if you feel there's a better way to express dislike of receiving it, but burning is a good way to protest. It's covered legally, and in the eyes of most civilised societies, by freedom of expression, also covered under freedom of speech. If you're in America, this is called the First Amendment of the US Constitution. If not, it's called the ""Don't do this to me again"" Amendment to the ""Respect my identity"" Constitution. The Bible was an intentional move against you, but when you get slapped in the face, you slap back harder.

On a much lighter note, you could donate the men's clothing that you don't want to a trans man or nonbinary friend if you have one, to a trans support group if there's one nearby, or to an organisation that can redistribute it to homeless or poor people. Charity is more Christian than bigotry is, so feel free to point this out if you get questioned on it.

For next year, if they've learned their lesson, you might suggest money or gift cards as an alternative. Gifts are meant to be out of generosity and kindness, so if they really mean it, this won't be as much of a problem for them to swap to.
Just started working on this, a Biblical rebuke to transphobic Christians.

Biblical Transgenderism

Outline:

Psalm 139:13-24
""For you formed my inward parts; you knitted me together in my mother's womb. I praise you, for I am fearfully and wonderfully made.""
Transgenderism is believed to start in the womb, when the body and mind each receive different amounts of hormones at different times.

""God doesn't make mistakes."" (This quote is not actually in the Bible)
He meant for you to be the way you are.

Genesis 1:26 ""let him have dominion...""
God gave us science to figure out the world around us.

God made the human body in a way that administering hormones in the right way can change a person's form from male to female or female to male. If this was not intentional it would be harder for us to do and figure out, or just impossible.

Deuteronomy 22:5 can be read as a call to aesthetically transition, imho.

All I've got so far.
You can donate them at the very least. Sorry that had to happen to you for christmas..better ones will come in the future. Just keep planning what you need to make it out of there and to get what you need and fight to make it happen. You're ""light"" just being yourself and being a good person will shine through ppls stigma
Tell them how you read in your new bible you wouldn't be allowed to wear those clothes because sheeps woll or smth i dunno im not familiar with it 😂

And also keep telling them ""oh look at this passage that is pro-trans!""cuz there are a couple of em, just google it online and you'll find em. They slap you in the face? Turn it around and slap em back!
Donate the clothes and leave the bible under the Christmas tree
I'm so sorry that this has happened. Its a shame that your family are choosing to behave this way - it says everything about them and nothing about you. I saw you're still young, stay strong until you can move out, there's a big bright future ahead for you.
im sorry girl, if your parents allow it maybe you could try and upcycle them into clothes you like better? or use it as material for crafts when they forget to try and turn the negative into something positive.

also, idk about you but i love doodling in my little bible. im not religious but it makes me feel confident to know the ancient words are simply mere paper.
You deserve better than their passive-aggressive abuses.
Oof same I just gave some stuff to my roommate lol
I'm FtM and started getting ""granddaughter"" cards from my biological grandma after I came out.

Then she told me the guy she *knew* raped me had a kid, she did this by saying ""Congrats, you're an aunt!"" And I promptly deleted her and her son as well off my Facebook.

Bitch had the gall to ask why I deleted her about a week later, I then blocked her. I wanted her to *know* I deleted her transphobic denying ass.
If you want to play it safe. Just put them in your wardrobe and never wear them.

Not justifying their attitude though.
I like returning them, and getting something you want, and keep us updated on this.
Dawg that is so shitty. I’m sorry
Sry people can. Be assholes but they can change
Fuck em. I'll get you some cute overalls and a necronomicon next year.
Oh I'm so sorry for you. I can gift you a labcoat if you like, they're unisex I think, and quite nice lookin either way ;;-)
They don't deserve you in their lives and you should make that known OP.
Oh honey 😭 That's an awful thing for them to do! You're so right to be upset by this.

Just an FYI, there are many great ways to alter boys/mens clothing to fem it up. If you got any t shirts, t shirt braiding and crop tops are simple and fun to make. Button up shirts you can tie above the waist and you can wear them like like a blouse or a cute top. I think taking their jab and turning it back around on them could be pretty empowering.

... also, I've heads that Bible papers can be used for rolling joints in a pinch... not that I'm advocating you do that 😏...
u/too-many-eggs? More like u/no-eggs-at-all
*I am your parent now.*
Not a good idea but if you want to spite them you can get the satanic bible off Amazon for like 12 dollars and its actually a very comforting read for like 2 thirds until you get to the rituals and shit lol
I received men's socks and deodorant, I took it and laughed it off.
Said sure thank you and threw into cupboard
Don't be upset over bs like that ;)
Tis the giving season, they just wanted you to feel the joy of donating all of it to goodwill
Can you style them in feminine ways?
I'd be on Pinterest thinking about how petty I can be.
First, before you take any advice on here take stock of your situation. You are the only one that knows exactly how vulnerable you are. I've read to many stories on here of individuals taking a stand only to find themselves homeless, unemployed, broke, and alone. Don't put yourself in a situation where that can happen to you. Understand how far you can push back without putting yourself at risk.

nobody cares about you like you care about you.
That’s awful.  I’m sorry. It just sucks.
Time for a neeew familyyyyy
Aaaaa this brings back memories of when my mom tried to have me excorsized to get the queer out and take all my collectable blades taken and replaced with the bible but i had my hand on the sheathe thinking ""do you really think that bibles stands better odds than my full tang short sword?"" But thankfully the situation got talked down and no exorcism was performed and i only had to give up the sword to get them to leave. Also  apparently my mom just asked them to pray for me in person and they just ran with that but i still dont buy it
Send it back.
If you got no FTM friends or can’t return them send them to me. I’ll pay shipping.
Time to drop some people.
Damn girl, I'm sorry. I want allowed home for Christmas by my bigot parents, they think I'll contaminate their kids, so we are in the same boat of douchebag parents
i (mtf) got very mixed message gifts from my dad, who is supportive, but probably just doesn’t get it. i’ve been out to family for at least 6mo, presents had my new name, but i got men’s clothes and a nice crystal glass set with some fancy (i think? idk my liquor very well) scotch.

luckily my spouse is transmasc and alcohol isn’t exactly gendered (at least not as much as society wants it to be)
Ugh. I'm so sorry. Real Christians wouldn't do this. Hugs to you, my sister. <3
Find all the weird incestuous stories in the Bible and ask is this why they got you the book.
What a power move burning the Bible in front of them would be
im so sorry
I’m so sorry. Perhaps give that bible back to them so they can review the passages about love, compassion, and kindness. They obviously need it more than you. As far as the clothes…I vote take them back and exchange them for something you love. I hope your family finds their way to be kinder at the next holiday because they majorly failed at this one.
Ask for receipts to exchange for cute dresses.
Return them. Cash is cash.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this! There are better times ahead.
They probably think its a phase. Still super messed up, and I would probably cut all the male clothes into crop tops and tank tops just to spite them
They're just a giant bunch of mfs. Sell them or burn them and then gift them at their birthdays. Send you hugs, baby :/ <3
Burn the Bible, and the clothes
Do they have a fireplace? Throw it all in and light it and thank them for such lovely kindling as you tear the pages out of the Bible and stuff it in.
i just came out (mtf) earlier this month and all i got for christmas was a bunch of men’s clothing too. today sucked.
Really sorry, that's horrible
The only mens clothing I accept is hoodies because I like oversized things, and some pants, because I need pockets
Throw them in the fire and say, after receiving these gifts it felt really cold in the room so I thought I'd warm it up.
idk if you have a fireplace in your house, if you do, burn the clothes in there right infront of them and maybe even the bible too
i’m so sorry :(
Right in the fireplace
This is just such disgusting behaviour from them. I want you to know this shit is not normal, not acceptable.
What’s yo size hunny
so basically, they gave you kindling for a warm fire
Hey if you need to reach out and chat I'm sure there's a bunch of lovely folks who would respond here in this sub!! I'm so sorry about your Christmas. That's extremely shitty.
Wow and I thought I had a bad Christmas experience. I'm so sorry that happened, fuck the people that thought that was any sort of good idea. True family accepts you as the beautiful woman you are ❤️
Ouch! Well, donate it all before year's end for a tax write off.
Well its sad😭
Ughh I’m so sorry that happened to you. Fuck those people you deserve way better.
Burn the Bible on front of them. Although the Bible never actually says anything about transgenderism. Dm me if you’ve got questions, I’ve read the whole book.
Fuck that. Fuck those people. Don't spend another single fraction of a fuck doing anything that acknowledges their awful existence. You deserve better.
I’d start a bone fire… 👀
Regift the Bible back to them, and give the clothes to someone in need. I've seen others suggest gifting them to other transmasc people, and as good as that thought is, I feel as though giving them to the impoverished and homeless would be a great way to turn something evil into something kind. People in such positions aren't picky but often can't provide for themselves properly, and new, clean clothing during this time would be very nice. Speaking as someone who was once homeless, acts of kindness can be the driving force behind getting back on your feet.
i'm so so sorry, this is just transphobia right in ur face at xmas. wtf. if you know where they came from, return them. i worked customer service & front end managing for retail for 5 years. & now is the time to return gifts you don't want for money or store credit. even if they don't have tags or packaging, turn those into cash money (or gift cards). why suffer just b/c they're giant abusive dicks? this is what i had to do w/my shitty gifts from bigoted ""christian"" family members who slapped me every year w/the most cis girl stuff in existence (i'm enby). & unfortunately, it sounds like you'll have to move out when you're 18, so every last bit you can sock away (even from the bigots whom you'll leave in your dust) helps. huge enby hugs <3
I’d burn it and send back a picture of it burning tbh
I'm sorry that happened.  You deserve better. Keep being your true self.
Burn the bible tell them you dont appreciate cult material trying to tell you whats supposed to make you feel bad, you can decide that stuff on your own.
I would literally burn the bible in front of them at that rate. They'd probably actually think you have a demon in you though.
Give the Bible to a church and find a trans masc to give the clothes too.
I'm sorry you went through this, for a while my family always used Christmas and birthdays as an opportunity to try and get me to detransition.
if you got any shirts you should cut them into crop tops that shit always cute
throw it out
Next year, give yourself the most feminine things you can for Christmas, and unpack them right in front of them
campfire material
I am so sorry 😢 religious zealotry as an excuse for prejudice is very hurtful and often comes from family. Just please know that you can always choose your own way and make your own family of accepting and supportive people if your birth family will not be there for you. Can you return the gifts and get something you want? Regift them? Or donate them? Sometimes ignoring the insult is best in the face of family when you are a minor…and waiting until you can live your own, best life on your own. Otherwise they learn how much they can get to you and do it even more, because sometimes people are just mean 😢
If you're brave enough I'd tell them you'll use it to pray for them... because if they knew anything about what it means to follow christ, they would know that they should accept and love you and see you for the woman you are, but they don't. It's not about them trying to help you, it's about them being selfish and bitter. so as much as it is hurting right now to feel like you don't have much of a family, just know that you'll find people who have your back. and one day, it might include members of your family. much love for you ❤
On mother’s day give her everything they gave you at christmas. The ultimate gift.
It's offensive on multiple levels. The whole point of Christmas gifts is to do something selfless for another person. This is such a hateful, horrible thing to do. I hope you made it clear to them how you feel about it, because that's really not okay.
Ask them for the receipts. If they give them to you return the clothes.  If they refuse, give the clothes away.  If you have a fireplace or a yard, put the clothes in a pile, spray fire starter on them and light ‘em up.
There's an LGBTQ+ org in my city that accepts donations of clothes, makeup, toiletries, etc. to give to people who are transitioning. Maybe, if you don't know anyone personally who'd want the items, Google orgs in your area and ask if they can pass them on to a trans man in need?

I'm so, so sorry your family did that to you, OP. It must've been utterly gut-wrenching. There's absolutely no excuse for treating anyone like that and you deserve so much better 💜
Burn the bible right in front of their eyes, PLEASE.
How much of a laugh would their faces be if you burned it all on front of them😈

I say video it all burning, Bible on top. Send video to brain-dead twats. Piss yourself laughing at whatever ridiculous response they pull out their arse!

And please be kind enough to post the video and response if you do do this. I beg you. Be a right laugh.
Donate them, get a donation receipt, and thank your relatives for the big tax break that you are gonna get 

It’ll drive them crazy
Throw bible in garbage and give male clothes to trans man
My scout brain just went:
""Campfire! **Campfire!** CAMPFIRE! **CAMPFIRE!**""
Burn them, possibly in front of whoever gave it to you. They didn't have any respect for you, why should you have it for them?
Trans men and trans women swooping gifts to make the passive aggressive incorrect gendered gifts they got, to then have bring love, positivity and gender-affirmative badassery ❤️❤️ it's the best!!
There we go 👊 Turning pain energy into POSITIVE energy! ❤️‍🩹🙏🌈
Or a christian trans man
Now that’d be poetic :)
I wonder if there are any trans community clothing swaps. It could be a great way to put a malicious gift to virtuous use.
Or even a cis male friend
This, 10/10
Wish I lived anywhere near other trans people so I could trade clothes and stuff with them :/

And I would like some friends
Give them a pile of stripper clothing and satanic Bible. Fight fire with demon fire.
I'm a month late but I'm sure there's a trans-friendly church that'd appreciate an extra bible!
The problem is I’m 16 and live with them.
Nah ask them to send you a postcard from hell
I think giving the clothes to charity or a trans man is a fab idea. If it was me I would casually chuck the Bible in the trash where they are likely to see it.
That’s the rawest fucking line I’ve ever heard.
That’s metal AF. 

I love it!
Ok go off
This should be the top comment and stickied to the top of the sub. 

You're probably not going to like me but this is truth. 

Stop defining who you are on how people see you. You give too much power to others who are not responsible and may not give a shit how you feel. No one is responsible for your happiness but you. Im speaking in general terms here. I get it. You are 16. You have years before you become truly sovereign and autonomous.  You have a hard life. Be strong. Suck it up. Tough it out and do the best you can. 

I am a 59 year old white man. I have my own story of chasing contentment if not real happiness.  By some accounts I am what's wrong with the world.  I am not trans. I came to this sub to learn how to communicate with my son. I come to you with compassion and empathy.  This is not just good advice for lgbtq. Its mandatory for all people.  If who we are and how we see the world is defined by other people, then we'll never know love. 

I could go on but I'll just be preaching, and that's not good for anyone.

Best wishes and Merry Christmas.
This... this is good
[removed]
Fuck yeah
As an MTF Christian, this is what I would do. The shit in the church is so ass backwards that I have spoken straight out of the Bible and pissed off Christians with their own words. They say they've read the Bible, but haven't *READ* the Bible! 

My favourite one to quote is ""Render to Ceasar what is Ceasar's, and to God what is God's."" In other words: The church should pay taxes!
Especially Ezekiel 23:20
I’d hiss at them and turn my head around backwards while crabwalking across the ceiling and back into my room
I haven't yet had the chance, but if anyone pulls this on me for reasons gender or otherwise^(1) I've already vowed to donate to the Satanic Temple equal value to whatever the fuck they give me.

In their name.  I feel like they'd take that a lot worse than a mere slap.  I'm _almost_ looking forward to it despite the fact it'd be insulting my identity.

^(1) me and my dad are both Jewish, my step-mother's dad is an evangelical protestant something-or-other and has already pulled this on my dad just for religion alone, though he's a lot more diplomatic in his throwing away the gift and requesting it please stop.
*Smite*, dear. One smites another with a bible
I’d use the bible paper as rolling papers like god intended
Typical religious bigotery as always \^\^

I've actualle never meet any person who really did understand its religion. Especionally pasages about beeing accepting are neglected most of the time. Very often they judge like god, which in the abrahamistic religions is only the right of god. Stupid morons, most people are to dumb for their own religion xD

For christians it's especionally funny when they care in any way about the old testament. I always ask myself then, when they care more of the pre-Jesus time than the post-Jesus time, why did they become christians ins the first place lol. Somebody who cares about the old testament in more than an informal way is per definition a jew bwaha
LOL
Thatd be so expensive lol
Heck yeah that's brilliant!
to add to the comment above, make sure your family has absolutely no way to access your money

I've seen it told many times of how children were robbed by their parents because the parents were on the child's bank account when it was created
A warning?
Right, give them toilet paper next year and say that you actually gave them something useful
Don't burn the book, donate the clothes. I say this because I'm against burning books no matter the reason.
cut the middle out and use it to hide oestrogen!
You know what that is a GREAT idea. Use their own insult against them. Poetic justice. 😂
Actually did that when I was homeless.  They would always pass out Gideons New Testament in pamphlet size.
Amen to that!
Nah, don't give anything to the salvation army. they're a terrible organization.
Salvation army is anti gay and anti trans
If they are FTM you should probably just use grandson and he/him pronouns.

Also, your experience is your own. Don't let random internet haters get you down. If you are trans, I wish you the best on your journey, if you're a gay or bi guy who likes to dress up in a traditionally feminine way, I wish you the best on your journey. If your a cis het guy who likes to fantasies about being a trans woman or a gay guy who likes dressing up in a traditionally feminine way, then boy howdy, you have a very long journey yet before you and I wish you the best.
[removed]
One of those verses that only makes sense if you are cishet 🤣

If you identify as a woman, then wear female clothes. male? Male clothes. Neither? I guess you have to be a nudest (/s) in seriousness, on that one, either works since you are neither man nor woman
(If you’re interested in Satanism, or if not and just curious idk) Might I suggest the Satanic Temple? I know ot doesn’t have anything to do with OP, but they don’t follow LaVeyan Satanism, so there’s not rituals and stuff (officially). Mainly just a progressive pro women and pro LGBTQ+ organization.
Cut them all up and make them into fabulous dresses! Less wasteful and a great way to get back at them while still enjoying the things themselves
I absolutely love this!! ❤️
Ikr this is always great!!
POSITIVE MENTAL ATTITUDE
I'm down for that!
Just leave both under the tree or in the common area. Passive aggressive enough that they will know what they did wasn't cool
The suggestion about being passive aggressive back is a good one but I’d suggest only taking that suggestion if it’s safe too, really depends on your family. I’m really sorry they’re doing this to you
I’m sorry hun…I wish I could take you into my home and make things better. I’m ftm so I know about family not accepting easily.
Can I ask roughly where you live? At 16 in most of the US or UK there are ways to become legally independent.
Sweetie I am so sorry for you. 2 years and then you can leave.
I Say, start ripping the pages out of the Bible for tissue paper. Unless your into that type of thing...
Have you looked into alternative religions? Maybe start giving out copies of the Vedas instead.
Don't celebrate with them anymore. They can't force you to do anything, no matter how much parents want to convince you otherwise. If they can't respect you and who you are, they deserve absolutely 0 respect themselves.
Ignore everyone telling you to do something hostile or passive aggressive.

Your family have too much power over you right now and can mess with your life in ways that will take years to recover.

YOU know who you are. You know the woman you will be free to live as one day.

Ride this out in a way that gets them to at least not actively interfere in your life and then when you are financially independent, you can choose how much contact you have with them.

Think long term. Get education certificates. Plan a career. Plan where you will live. Learn budgeting. Learn inexpensive food prep.

Almost EVERYTHING in how quickly and easily you are able to live free of your family's influence comes down to how you are able to handle financial independence.
Sell the clothes on Etsy or Depop and use the money to buy clothes you want to wear, depending where you are there could be resources for you to get out of there into a safe place.
Oh my god same (but I'm not out yet) I hate this so much
Throw it out tbh, it's not like you'll use it and it sends a strong message (if you thinks it's safe to at least)
Do you know how to sew?  Can you alter the clothing to make it female clothing?  
I don't know how to fix the bible though.  That shit is always going to be bigoted.
That's a rough place to be friend. It's a good time to consider how you'll be able to be independent in the future. Until that future arrives be safe, and do what you need to do to get by. The path ahead of you may be hard, but you'll be able to find good friends when you're able to be your own person.
Leave them under the tree. When they ask say: oh. I’m sorry. I thought those were for someone else.
It gets better. It gets a LOT better. Honestly, it gets so much better so fast, that in 3 Christmas’s you’ll be laughing your ass off, living the good life
Don't make a big deal out of it. Donate the clothes to a shelter and throw out the Bible or donate it as well. Be the bigger person, turn something that you view as negative into a positive.
Oh no! I'm so sorry, and I'm your mom now. Welcome to the family, you're not the first LGBTQIA kid so no pressure!
You live with them... For now. Happy story time... 

I was in an abusive relationship for ten years. For three years I saved money for a flat (apartment).

Once day a moving van turned up with two guys to collect my stuff. I started filming her... I told her ""touch them, or my stuff and I'll have your arrested. I'm leaving you and never coming back.""

She tried to emotionally blackmail me.. She threatened me... She cried... Then, as I was taking out the last box she screamed to the world ""that's right... Get out and never come back!""

My neighbour gave me a thumbs up, and a smile as I left.

The joy I felt that day, I will never forget. I was FREE!

I tell you this to give you hope. I left TEN YEARS of abuse and found happiness... You can too.

You live with them for now... But you have more power than them. You can save up and leave. You're an adult now (UK). And if you're in the US, by law your parents can't kick you out till your 18. So you can get a job for two years, refuse to give them any money, save it All, and leave when you're 18.

It's a scary idea... But it's better than being abused. Trust me, I speak from experience.

And trust me again; It does get better... if you work on making yourself happy. You have power. Use it.
i feel so sry for your parents. they will ask themself their whole life where they messed up. So sad
I was honestly thinking ""leave them folded on top of the trash"" but didn't want to encourage anything unsafe.
Yes we have to try to be strong but its easier said than done. Statistics show that nearly half of all trans people attempt suicide. The number is a lot lower for trans people who are accepted by their parents. The kinds of transphobic gestures from parents like OP's do incredible psychological harm to trans people. I'm glad that you're making efforts to support your son. That will make a major difference in his life. But we should not live in a world where only the strongest among us survive and those of us who cannot endure the social torment and exclusion and stigma don't- we also have to push to make the world a more hospitable place for trans people. And it's also not something people have to face alone - no man is an island and I hope OP has friends or a school counselor or teacher or someone to reach out to for support
It is a **great** comment! FWIW, only mod comments can be pinned (that I know of).
Somebody's jealous\~\~
My sister told me I was going to hell so I told her to tell me in the Bible where it says not to be trans. She still can't find it but she seems to have settled on

""It feels sinful""

She really doesn't know anything about her own religion its just an excuse to be an asshole
Omg. I ❤ u.
*your mother sucks socks that smell!!*
👏😹👏😹👏😹
I stand corrected!
I knew those Gideons were using that thin-ass paper for a reason.
Yup, Jesus said to love everyone. I believe God made us to be exactly who we are and that's trans. The people hating us for who we are are the ones not following Gods word
Yes, but worth it. You would be banned from Christmas for giving your grandma a dragon dildo (unless she into that) 🤮😂😭😭😭😭
meirl (father took 95% of my money that was in my primary and joint account when i came out and had to run away form home post disownment)
It's a good thing the Bible has a story about getting your dad drunk so you can rape him to get pregnant or other people might do it too /s/
It is estimated that over 5 billion bibles have been printed. Its backed up electronically and in print in numerous places.

This particular copy represents a purposeful assault on a trans person's mental health by their family. 

I'm not willing to overlook the harm to protect a book that needs absolutely no protection whatsoever. 

I still think op should burn it, unless they would find more joy in shredding it and donating the remains to a paper recycling facility.
Words cant describe how metal that sounds
That's why they'd take the Bible. It's probably the only book they think people need so they'd gladly take it. They wouldn't even realize that you giving that to them is basically a giant middle finger to their way of life.
I love dressing as a Women and wish I was born a Girl.  My Wife knows but she doesn't like it, but she tolerates it. I love my Wife with all of my heart and wish she was more excepting. My grandson who is a trans boy (he's in his teens). I love him and I'm proud of him for being courageous enough to come out. The younger generation is more tolerant of LBGT+ Community and unfortunately my Generation isn't. Damn Boomers lol. I've known that I like ""Girl's"" clothing and the idea of being a girl since I was 6 or 7. Lot's of love to you! ❤️
And what the hell does that mean? Are you a homophobe? Sure looks like it to me. If so you're on the wrong sub.
I can't be sure, but I think grandson is the term of choice. They say FTM, even if they mostly use she/her pronouns. Also, someone can be both sexually arosed by their own transness and also trans. It can be pretty exciting to explore that part of yourself if you've been closeted for years. Just because they used some crass and mildly offensive language while doing so doesn't erase their experience. If they're trans, you're being an asshole. If they're a gay femboy in a hetero marrege, then you're being an asshole. If they're a bi femboy who doesn't feel able coming out to their wife, then you're being an asshole. Don't be an asshole.
I must apologize I would have updooted your comment but it was at 69 so I can’t exactly ruin this but please have a celebratory nice
PMA!
Yeah me too! I got gifted so many bras and I still have the padding, I guess a trans girl would give them a better use than I
This. If you take the clothes, you accept their gift. Leave it there to sit. Don't touch it, it isn't for you. If someone has a problem with it, that's on them. I'm so sorry you're in this situation for the next 2 years at least but don't put up with this kind of stuff!
Honestly, this! 

There's no way they didn't realize what they just did. Especially with adding a Bible. Pardon my french because OP is 16, but kindly fuck them. I'd burn the Bible.
Either this or donate all of the clothes and make it *very* apparent that you're doing so.
Or the fireplace
Legal independent in the US requires financial means to support yourself.
[deleted]
For Toilet paper, not tissues
Etsy is mostly a market for a handcrafted items, not sure why they would sell clothes they received for Christmas on there
Hey that’s good fabric, you could make some stuffed Satan dolls outta that material
Just a minor correction but the statistic is the number of trans people *who are in an unsupportive environment who have _contemplated_ suicide,* not total overall. The actual suicide rate for trans people is lower than the average for cis people
There are many huge and primitive questions in this discussion.  Children need to deify patents. As kids we are incapable of providing for our own needs. Our lives depend on those that gave us life. So how does a soul thrive after realizing that it's support system is in many ways inadequate?  How do we learn to nurture ourselves?  What is societies role in this? Does government have a role? 

Psychiatry, psychology, demography, sociology and others all have comments and perspectives that would take years to fully digest. Many volumes have been written and many more are still to come. 

I'm a truck driver.  If there is a small way that I can  ease someone else's path then I've done good. I understand that statistics are gloomy. I try not too look at big pictures.
[removed]
I believe God made us exactly who we are ment to be. That's trans. And he said to love everyone. So all the people spending their time hating us are the ones who are wrong
95% of practicing American Christians right here. Most of them that actually put in the effort to learn the Bible are pastors, atheist, or both.
I love you too
Ah, the ‘Edited for TV’ version.
PS: Thank you for the word's of encouragement. Merry Christmas!!
[removed]
muahhhahahahhahahahaa your kindness means nothing muahaha
Alternatively, donate it all to goodwill!  
Tell the parents that at least someone will get some use out of it and we are sure those people will be grateful.
I’d be like, “Know who this would look great on?  Whoever it’s getting donated to after I drop it off!”
Oh they definitely know what they did. Similar situation here (I'm 16 as well) but I'm not out to my family and they're hyper religious and transphobic. They'd definitely do something like this though if they knew
OMG how did you know I wanted a book of rolling papers!?
This is why trans and gays don't stay in the church. People need to stop using the Bible to be hateful
Donate them to transmascs specifically
Yes, and they can't complain about this, because charity is a very Christian thing to do. Which you can let them know, very loudly and pointedly, if they say anything.
Step 1: roll doobies using Bible paper

Step 1.5: burn Bible

Step 2: enjoy the warmth of the devil's lettuce
It's okay, I accept you. However long it takes for you to figure out who you are or what you want, that's your journey, and the people in your life who have shit on you and made you feel like lashing out is your only choice are just as meaningless as the insults you fling at those different from yourself. 

You'll know your truth one day, sweet one.
You're in the wrong sub and you're reported. What I do in my time is none of your business and judgement. I'll even bet you're a right winger who doesn't feel whole unless you're in someone else's business. Good bye homophobe.
What a sad human
This \^

I know it's not as powerful as just leaving them there, but I'd say fuck it. OP clearly already has some power. Leave the bible and donate to the rest to goodwill (if possible and will not put you in danger). May as well give some people a merry Christmas.
That's a good interpretation of ""burn the book"" and I second it! 😂
This is why I have ""rebelled"" against Christianity. My name says it all. In my mid to late teens is when I started to really notice how hateful and discriminatory Christians are and that really pushed me away, besides the fact that my parents forced me to go to church.
+1 donating clothes to trans masc and trans men is insanely fun
I love this!
Burn the bible
Better yet burn the Bible
Religious theorists are saying Satanism is the next Christianity. It's so inviting and welcoming without discriminating or hating anyone.
Or cut all the pages so you can hide some of your stuff in it. I know it’s not big but who would check if it’s your personal bible? 🤔
Why not give the Bible to a homeless shelter or donate it to someone who has alcohol abuse or drug abuse or Opioid abuse and is working on getting clean and staying clean from drugs and alcohol and opioids ?
To those with an open mind yes, but many Christians are closed-minded and chose to let their fear of evil guide them. Christianity is still in a high majority I believe 85% or greater in North America. So it's like not there will be some religious turn around anytime soon. But for those like me, who disagree with Christianity and have a open mind. Satanism is a pretty good, laid back choice. It's just a kind, safe space to be in. Plus, we don't go knocking on doors shoving it in your face. (That's a jab a Jehovah's Witnesses) 

Getting off track, I don't understand why there are 3 or more versions of the same religion with different names for their god. Doesn't that seem weird to anyone else?
Shawshank Redemption vibes.
Yes yes yes
Also good
Actually this year more people have identified as non religious than ever before. More people are leaving Christianity every year. At the end of the day, people love Christianity and religion because it's a family thing. It bridges generations... But once you take the family out of it, is it really that important?  Why have a family if you're not connecting? That's what Christians are asking God. So we'll see where all this leads..."	rodp93	trans	3524	0.91	2021-12-25 17:27:07

answering faq lol

1. I personally found this dress thrifting though I have seen nearly identical dresses on amazon.


2. I'm a lesbian 

3. my necklace is two things the Pomegranate is for my Judaism, the T is for part of my name.

4. no my bridge didn't hurt, and yes you should get one too :p
You do you! You are rocking that dress and can easily throw jackets on should you want to wear it out. Your hair, make-up, and necklace work so well together. You look amazing and should do what you need to do so you can feel as beautiful as you are.
you are an absolute inspiration to me <3
Oh my God. You are stunning.
So pretty! Lovely style and still edgy. Your haircut especially works with your beautiful face. 

You might like to post to r/cottagecore since they appreciate this style very much.

Hello I'm Todd very interested in being your friend
So lovely
Wow, you look stunning. I love your style and you have such pretty eyes!
You're a true gem, especially in that lovely dress.
Wow You are so cute
I have that problem too. Summer clothes are way cuter. 😊 But as long as you've got a long warm puffer it works. 💜
yea, that's summer weather
Sooo pretty <3
This is probably going to be buried but I realized I'm trans and a big part of that was wanting to look like you so badly. Anyways. I'm out now and you are my goals.
Beautifully immaculate
You look beautiful! but... is -2°C warm?
My exact reaction.
Ah I was thinking it was a reference to Persephone from Greek mythology. I love the piercing and you look great!
Love the necklace!
your whole aesthetic is so pretty, i envy
Slut
Right? Double true for winter clothes. So so so much cheaper
Same. I thought cute, but same idea
Then why in the hell are you browsing a trans sub, looking at pictures and posting comments? Really makes no sense unless it’s something you’re into. If not, just sit down and stfu.
congrats on the gender!!!! <333333
Trans-pans unite!

Who else makes their own clothes?! I feel more confident in something I personally made.		"That's beautiful ❤️
i’ve been wanting to get into it, and this only re-confirms that i do- can i ask how you do it? you and your outfit both look amazing!
I've made a few things
Omg, girl you are on fire 🔥🔥🔥. You're so gorgeous and I love your clothes. Do you have a website or take commissions? I would totally buy your clothes, hun. You have such skillz. ♥️♥️♥️
You made that! Wow, I’m impressed. I wish I was skilled enough to do something like that.
Babe, you are a literal fucking goddess, what the fuck
I do. Not long ago I did a cute skirt. It went spinny.
guess what, you got crafty and made ur own confidence, and i think that's pretty cool B)💜
Wtf?! Not me. Ur amazing girl.
Super beautiful.
You look amazing
Damn!!! That dress (and you) is GORGEOUS!!! You are AMAZING to have made that!! I love the blending of vintage styles (chick strapless that kind of feels like an Audrey Hepburn/Marilyn Monroe style with the fringe being more flapper girl vibe) and you look stunning in it! Fantastic job!!
I sew but I haven't been able to really do much lately
Can you make me one? That is such a cool dress!
Oh wow that looks wonderful on you!
You look gorgeous oml ❤️❤️
Looks really good on you, your gorgeous
Cute!
I want an embroidery machine so bad and you've just reminded me lol
That’s a beautiful dress!
Very lovely dress!
Oh my GOSH I want a dress like that 😍 you look absolutely incredible
If you ever feel like doing tailor work hmu
Wish i could make my own clothes that looks awesome
[deleted]
[removed]
Wow you're talented
that dress looks absolutely stunning  
and you look even more beautiful
That stringy part of the skirt — i bet it looks and feels awsm when you walk
Gorgeous, and you have inspired me to do so
[deleted]
Damn, you look amazing
P-pretty 👉👈🥺(could ya make for me)
oh wow 😮
This looks great! I think it fits so well on you ☺
But also, let's be honest, you look absolutely gorgeous ❤ and if I looked like you I think I would feel comfortable no matter what I am wearing because sis.. you look just.. wow 😍💕

Great looking Lady in Great looking Dress
Amazing 😊
Wow, looks very luxurious. I used to cut my old jeans and tshirts some time ago but now I just wear what I buy. However I like to wear DIY clothes. Theyr limited version.
Wow, that looks amazing 😄
You're stunning and that dress flatters you so much! Amazing!
I need to start doing this. Although I have no skills in clothes making, but it's so hard to find things that fit and look nice.
[deleted]
Fabulous outfit - well done for making it, and for being brave enough to wear it!!!
I just started making my own, and it's so great. Especially since I can control the sizing and make it perfect.
Damn, you need talent for that and I’ve got none.
Damn that looks nice. Excellent craftsmanship!!
I just buy sweats... that all lol
This looks amazing, but I will probably make clothes myself, F
I love the dress!!! You made that?
I do!  I like huge skirts, and one can't buy them, so making them is the only alternative.  

I also like to wear short skirts in winter, so I have an entire wardrobe (skirts, petticoats, corsets) made of polarfleece.
Damn you look great
I don't make clothes from scratch but I like adjusting clothes.
That’s gorgeous, and looks really well made
What? How? That's amazing!
Damn girl, you made that? Wish I had skills like this, super cute!
I'd really like to start, I'd love to just make the things that would make me feel the best, but honestly I'm a bit lost as to where to star. It looks amazing by the way!
i crochet and i love making my own stuff!!
I don't, but I really want to.
That dress is fucking gorgeous babe. I’ve always wanted to learn to sew but toxic masculinity never allowed me to take the next step.
That’s so crafty! I love it!
I like to shop at Goodwill and then tailor the clothes to fit me. I'm working my way up to making clothes, but for right now it's easier to buy something a bit big and then tailor it a bit to fit me. Plus, that way if it's no longer in style in a year or so it was only $6 so I don't feel bad about donating it
AWESOME job on the clothing! Actual designer AND model! :)
I love it! I need something like that
That’s awesome good job 👏🏻
I made a crochet cardigan that’s warmer than the warmest afghan. I keep saying I’ll get into sewing. Soon will be the day!
That's amazing! You look so great in it.
Thank you all for your supportive words, I really appreciate that. I don't have many friends, So hearing your kindness really warmed my soul <3 Wow ; Thank you all.

If you would like to follow my Instagram, I have posted quite a few things that I have made, I can also make another post here!

Wow that dress is so stylish! you look hot!
Thank you 😍❤ its super comfortable
Thanks love❤ you should try messing around! 

I am addicted to fabric buying, especially vintage / old ones.

I like to take an old bra , and transform it into something else. This was a bra, and lots of fabric! 

I made a duct tape breast form, thats exactly my size, and I go from there!

The fringe is from dollarama!
It may seem kinda dumb but several companies out there make clothing kits. I like to hand sew with wool and other heavy warm materials, especially with how cold it is up here.
Show us 🥰
Thank you so much for your kindness!! <3 You can for sure follow my instagram! A lot of the things I am wearing over there, I made!

[https://www.instagram.com/caseybleu](https://www.instagram.com/caseybleu)

I hope soon, I have the required items to start making clothes for other people! I am trying to get a sewing machine, I do everything by hand right now.
Oh wow, thank u xoxo you just gotta try! I still have my first piece and its not so nice lol ill post it maybe tomorrow!
Oh wow <3 Thank you. I am no where near a goddess ; Just a human <3
Ooo Show us the spinny skirt <3
Thank you so much! Growing up in a tiny Canadian town, Always being the ""weird"" one, I had to develop my own self confidence because people always tried to tear me down.
Thank you so much! its 644 and now I want a burger because of your user name lol
Thats very kind <3
Thank you, That is very kind <3
OMG <3 I am glad that translated, I have a Marilyn Monroe obsession.. My entire living room is covered in Marilyn artwork, pillows, blankets, room divider and more. I even named my Cat after her!   


I was trying to go for a vintage meets modern look - The breasts were difficult because Marilyn had such a STUNNER body, & I am rail thin. I try and make clothing that gives my body my desired shape - even if its just an illusion.
The pandemic really put a STOP on everything. Thankfully I am a hoarder, I have a few garbage bags full of fabric - I ONLY buy thrifted fabric, never new.
One day, hopefully soon - I will have the required items to start sewing for other people.
I appreciate that! I used a duct tape breast form to make sure it fit me JUST RIGHT!
:3 so kind of you to say, Thank you ; There are some stunning humans on this reddit page, I was inspired to post because I seen so many amazing pictures!
Thank you so much! <3
omg I WISH! My finger tips hate me, I hand sew everything.
Thank you so much!
Thank you!! <3
<3 If you were local I would say, Come over - If it fits, its yours!
One day, I would love to offer my services!
You can! Just practice with an old pair of jeans.   


( I turned an old pair of jeans into thigh high boots! Maybe I should upload the picture? )
You should! Its so fun. ( besides the fact I have to hand sew everything lol )
<3! Thank you
With a little practice, I am sure you could do this - or even better! I am no professional, Just a human with a creative vision.
Thank you for your kind words <3 I appreciate that.
My dogs like to think its a toy and they chase me when I wear it LOL!
Yessss!! I hope you upload a picture one day to show us.
Thank you <3
<3 Thank you!!
One day when I get a sewing machine, I would love to make clothing specifically for trans individuals! I Know how hard it is finding bras that actually fit me, or a dress that makes me feel more feminine. I would love if I could help other people out in feeling more comfortable.
( lol at your name! ) 

Thank you so much! I started with a duct tape breast form and started sewing material over it to make sure it fit my body exactly how I wanted.

I appreciate your kind words! I wish I felt comfortable no matter what, But I guess we all have our own insecurities <3.
That is how I started! When I was younger I used to cut apart my old jeans and shirts, sew them back together into something that fit me better, and made me feel more confident.

I find my favorite pieces are the ones I have altered or made myself.
Thank you! <3
That is so kind to say :3 Truly THANK YOU <3
You should start! Find an old pair of jeans, and cut them apart. Turn them into something different - I have turned jeans into skirts, boots, jackets, shirts and even chokers!
If we lived close, You would not have to steal, I would just give it to you!
Thank you so much! I don't like to call myself brave - But I have no problem being myself and showing the world who I am <3
Thats the best part! I have purchased some great items, but they are never my exact size. I find myself feeling more comfortable in something I have created.
We all have talent! Just have to practice xo
Thank you so much :3   


I hope to start making outfits for other people very soon!
Thats basically what I wear on a normal day! Lol RN i have a sweater and sweats on ; going to the grocery store lol
Yes! I cant wait to start making more.
Wow...I’m jealous of your talent. Have you ever considered making custom clothing for others?
Oh wow, I would love to see some pics of your wardrobe! Sounds STUNNING!
Thank you so much!
I bet your items look amazing!
Thank you so much, I really appreciate it. I cant wait to use my new sewing machine and create even more complex items.
With a needle and thread! I hand sewed it. I was able to purchase a sewing machine, so the next piece I make will be much better.
Yes! I made it about a year ago <3 Thank you \~ Practice and you can do anything.
I taught myself! I hand sew everything. project runway has been super helpful LOL
Care to show us any of your creations? I would love to see! I wish I could crochet!! I 100% dont have the eyes for that, I am basically blind.
<3 Give it a try! and show us what you create? <3
<3 Take the next step! we are all supporting you. I love hand sewing!
Thank you, I appreciate it! I find myself doing crafts all the time, growing up poor I had to find a way to turn trash into treasure! I never buy new materials- the fringe is from dollarama, but besides the fringe ; everything is thrifted or used material.
I cant wait until thrift stores are open again! I live in Ontario, Canada - and we have an extended lock down rn... Most stores are barricaded off so we can only purchase things like food.
I love modeling, its always been a passion of mine. And i love fashion! I thought, why not combine them?! I dont have to pay a model, i just wear my own creations
One day I will make you one!!
Thank u so much xo
Im so jealous!! I wish i could crochet, but im basically blind my eyes are sooooo bad.
Thank you so much 🥰❤
Im not sure what this means but I watched the video! Lol
So are you like self taught?
Oh wow, care to show us?!
oh nice!! that’s super cool to know you hand sew, i have a small hand-sewing kit myself but all i’ve done is patch holes and make a face mask lol

yeah i understand that completely, but hey you're doing a great job :)) keep it up okay! and make sure you keep that confidence 💜
What’s 644?? Thanks my user name is a bad englishization of a Japanese joke. 😇
Well it has worked well cause you look just as stunning as her!! And aww!! Marylin is classic and she was an amazing woman of pop culture history!! 🥰
You are very welcome
Yesss
Love that attitude! Very inspiring
You will be one of the first to see
Where do you sew now, if you don't have a sewing machine?
I guess youtube is my friend to help start a project like this! Thanks for the encouragement.
[deleted]
Oh, thank you. I needed that.
Oh you could make a killing! Clothes for trans girls by a trans girl, you know the unique challenges in finding clothes that work for us. I say give it a shot!! Best of luck!
Hells yeah! Making your own clothes is a truly underrated talent that pays off in the future, especially if you have trouble finding something in the store, you can literally make your own style!
That makes it so much cooler! And I may have just spent a hour on sewing tutorial videos
i absolutely would! i also have an instagram page to showcase and sell my creations. i do a lot based in pride flags, fruits, and disney themed stuff. it’s one of my favourite hobbies!
Sure, if I ever get around to making anything, LoL.
❤️❤️❤️

When I finally go thrifting for girl clothes (currently living with phobic aunt but she pays rent and I still haven’t 100% worked out a way to hide stuff when she moves out anyway lol) I’ll definitely look for a machine.
Absolutely! I hope both the clothing and the modeling work out for you! :)
I'd love that!
Yes! Project Runway has helped, and youtube! I hand sew everything.
I want a sewing machine so bad! My fingers HURT after sewing.
That is BEAUTIFUL! ( and you have great legs! )
6 44 am lol :3
My obsession started because my mom told me she was Marilyn Monroe as a kid LOL I told all my friends and even my teachers ( they look very very similar ) It was not until I was like 14 did I realize... shes not Marilyn hahaha
Thank you <3 <3
<3 I cant wait!
I hand sew everything! My fingers hate me - But my mind needs to create.
If you have saran wrap and duct tape - search ""duct tape breast form"" so you can have the EXACT shape of your body.  


I am not a professional, I watch a lot of project runway! I find starting small is best, and work your way bigger and bigger with each project. YOU CAN DO IT <3
I live in Canada! Yes - My instagram is,  https://www.instagram.com/caseybleu
<3 I have faith in you!!
Thank you so much 😍❤ i was able to buy a sewing machine, so I can start asap. Im so excited
Never know if we have a real apocalypse one day! Sewing will come in handy 😂❤
I love watching tutorials! Makeup, Sewing, Computer tech ; I love to learn new skills! You never know when you need to create something with your own hands.
Ooo whats your insta! I will follow you!
Youre so kind. Thank you, i hope soon to help other trans women feel comfortable in their clothing.
gosh hand sewing is just absolute grunt work .... pre hrt i used to hand make my own stuff (obviously it was sooooo bad) but hand sewing was just unbelievably time consuming , anyways this is really pretty  , must have been hard work though
lol. You deserve a burger!! All day everyday!!
Yesssssss! It's always good to see someone doing what they love. :)
Honestly, same. Though my personal preference tends to be towards programming and cooking. I love clothes, but they have always looked so hard to make!!!
handmade_by_jae and i don’t have a ton of stuff uploaded quite yet but i will be getting my recent stuff uploaded as soon as i can!
That would be a great day in history, wouldn't it? Stomp out all bigotry so nobody has to worry about dealing with the crap. Actual freedom. :)
Omg sooo much work! LOL I still have a project I have not finished because when I look at it, I see how many times I have stabbed my fingers lol.
Your username has inspired me to to eat a burger, Thank you xo
I will follow you right now!!
Oof i relate to that lol

Just got my first set of women clothes, what do you all think?		"Absolutely gorgeous!
i want that skirtttttt so muchhh where did u get it
DAAAAAAANG! That midriff is perfect down to the milimeter!
You look gorgeous!
Simple, yet tasteful. Excellent choice miss
Lookin' good ! But maybe not good enough for that nsfw tag
I love to sew & I've gotten into fitting.

The belt and skirt are AWESOME. They really accentuate your slenderness, in a hot, femme way.

I'm not feeling the shirt so much. It looks *good,* but I think a different choice could look *great.* Would you like some suggestions?
Looks amazing!!
You look great!
Cuuuuuuute
 OMG ME TOO! It feels exactly how you look! AMAZING!!!!
Omg you look fantastic!
Oh this is a LOOK
You look great sister
Very cute! Rocking it.
I think they look excellent on you!
Ahhh absolutely stunning on you!
Hey I wore one of those skirts on my last day of school (today). It was my statement peice showing the start of my life as Stella.
Thick. (Don’t wanna be offensive btw)

Yes Yes yes

It might be cute by itself if you are fairly young. That combo may be too little and too much skin.

The general rule for older girls and women is midriff OR legs can go bare but NOT both.

It somehow looks inappropriate beyond a young girl's Sailor Moon age, but it could work for role-play or just fantasy.
you look absolutely gorgeous,, so happy for you
Thanks ❤️
Look for your local Bershka
Look up ‘pleated skater skirt’
woah, I thought that was a belt. I like the outfit much better now
Thank youuuu
Just in case 
I don’t wanna get banned :)
I happily would! 
I’m really inexperienced when it comes to fashion and style so I really appreciate the help!
I thought I couldn’t! 
But after looking for a while and finding things I like, I tried it on and it turned out great! 
If I can, so do you
I bet you can!
I thought I couldn’t but here I am

Idiot
and she’s a woman, so women clothes
Dunno about you, but I've never seen a crop top business shirt in the men's section, myself. Maybe I just don't shop in the right places?
If they wanna wear a shirt they can wear a fucking shirt
Ew
Older people can be hot too, and you could hurt someone's feelings. There isn't a 'too old'.
Bershka is based
No problem!
Psht, you wouldn't get banned. Not unless you were one of those spam accounts posting sex ads. Often if there's something too risque we'll just remove it. If it's consistent then we'll move up to a temp or even a perm if the person ignores us.
Okay, how comfy are you showing skin?

If the answer is very, then I think a dainty black camisole with lace at the top could be awesome. If you pair that with a very lightweight strapless bra, to give just more dramatic hint of cleavage, hot damn. If you haven't bought a strapless bra yet, I'd specifically look for an a-line bra or ""longline"" bra. That's going to provide a smoother effect, IMO.

If you'd like something more covering, totally cool. I think a black and white floral fitted shirt would really look femme, classic, and gorgeous. 

Would you like me to look for specific examples?
You are correct.  Whoosh on me
Point taken

I should know I guess. I turned 65 in March and basically am 45 other than that age.

They made me take Medicare Part A

Of course any other person on here can be hot and not ""too old"". 

I've seen some very vital looking trans women on FFS post op photos in their 70's 

Betty White still seems vital and younger men could well be seeking her out.

Sorry if I offended anyone.
why have I never heard of Bershka imma look at them later
Thanks for telling me! I removed the nsfw tag"	nfkkbd	trans	3339	0.97	2021-05-18 19:59:18
In-laws showed up to our door unannounced after learning I am trans (MtF)	"Some background before I begin, my wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 3. Her parents are incredibly conservative, outwardly racist and clearly homophobic. They do not know we are married; it was a courthouse marriage done for paperwork reasons, and we plan to have our 'real' wedding later. Her parents do not know this, as my wife assumed they would not take it well. For the last few years I have been on a bit of a process of self discovery, which led to the realization that I am trans, and I began HRT about 7-8 months ago. My wife and I have talked a lot about our relationship and the challenges and changes that transitioning can bring about, and we are happier now than ever, and plan to stay together.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday, my wife decided (after months of planning) to finally tell her mom about me transitioning on her weekly phone call. We expected this to go poorly, and our expectations were met. Basically, they don't view trans people as people, and don't believe that it would be possible for us to ever be happy together. Her mom was convinced that I would leave her for a man, highly unlikely given that I'm a lesbian (and we're married). Her mom cut her out of the family, saying anyone who wants to be with a trans person can't be a part of her family. Obviously this was sad and disappointing, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Monday (the next day) was my wife's birthday, so I made her meals and gave her gifts when she wrapped up working from home that day, a little before 5. We had just finished unwrapping when there was a knock at the door, and I saw her mom's frizzled hair from the window. I was in running shorts and a t-shirt with no bra, no makeup, and no shower after working out, so in no way fit to talk to people who have never seen me as a woman. Mind you, they also live 60-90 minutes away, so this was clearly a planned trip. When my wife answered the door, they walked right into the house and demanded to speak with both of us immediately. I was hiding in our laundry so as not to be seen, and begged my wife to make them wait outside or in their car for 10-15 minutes while I got ready. Eventually they moved to our front porch, where they stood staring into the windows.

&#x200B;

I went upstairs, tried to calm myself and change clothes, then went down to deal with them. They were waiting on the front porch, and when I opened the door to walk out, they refused to back up or give any room, so we were extremely close to each other. Now, I will tell you, I had kinda always expected something like this. I have never shared that I am very progressive in my politics, but over the years I have known them, they have always worked to push my buttons. I typically don't speak when we are all together, and they have never seen me actually behaving like myself. Tbh, they have no clue who I really am, and never cared to know. I figured one day they would push me over the edge, but I always thought I would be able to control myself and my emotions. Please know, dear reader, that when I tell you what happened next, that I have no hate for people who alter their appearance for happiness. Clearly, I am willing to do the same, given the amount of HRT, hair removal, and makeup I go through on the reg. But when I opened that door and stepped outside, the first words out of my MIL's mouth were, ""Nice breasts"". Almost immediately and without thinking, I scoffed and said, ""Well, at least mine are real.""

&#x200B;

So that's how the conversation started. Everyone gasped and took a step back (except me, since my back was already on the door). I think she was extremely taken aback, as she has never known me to talk back, nor do I think she was aware that I knew she had a boob job (they're not big). But I think it surprisingly made everyone calm down a bit, as she realized she wasn't ready for an insult fight. For the next 5-10 minutes, she talked about how we are terrible, lying children, and could never understand the pain we were causing her as a mother. They said that there was no way my wife could make the decision to stay with me, as she couldn't view it objectively since she was in a relationship with me. They tried to convince us not to get married (bit late on that one, lol) because, as they put it, ""it's only a 50-50 shot this even works out"", and that I couldn't decide until I'd ""finished all that transition stuff"". They said it was fine for me to decide to live a perverted lifestyle myself, but immoral to bring their daughter into it, and that my wife's mother had the right to tell her what to do. My wife was amazingly calm, and made it clear that she could make her own independent choices as an adult, and that we were very happy together. All the calm logic in the world wouldn't help, though, as my MiL is nuts.

&#x200B;

Then came the real anger. My MiL said that her sister was threatening to strangle me with her bare hands, and to 'just wait and see what happens when I tell the rest of the family'. She then took out some cheap-ass dishware that I assume she was going to give as a gift, and started throwing it on our porch to break, screaming that this is what I was doing to her family and her mind. She said that her mind was broken, and that she couldn't control what came out of it, and that I should be worried for what that might mean for me. After breaking all the dishes (or trying, she isn't very strong so some of the dishes survived), she said ""clean up your mess"". I responded that it wasn't my mess, it was hers, but that since I was a reasonable adult that I would clean it up for her, and not call the cops if she left. That really got her going, as she started screaming that she was not afraid to go to jail, that I should call the cops and see what happens. At this point, her husband, who had remained relatively calm, began to physically drag her away to their car whilst saying, ""you promised not to go crazy... You promised not to lose your mind!"" She was raving the whole way to the car, foaming at the mouth and all. Not a pretty sight.

&#x200B;

We cleaned up the dishes and tried to decompress after. In hindsight, I'm super glad we made her leave the house before talking to her, as she clearly had planned this to happen in our home. I think she probably would have broken our own possessions as well, given the lack of control she had. I was extremely proud of my wife for handling herself so well, and surprised at my own lack of control in the moment. Guess the lesson is that it's really hard to control 8 years of pent up anger, harder than I would've thought. Luckily, I only responded in kind, and never even thought of getting physical or yelling. We haven't heard much else from them, other than one ""damn her"" text from the MiL on the way home (which, honestly, props for using the correct pronouns, I wasn't expecting that). We have been cut out of any wills, family events (thank god, they sucked), or contact, but since we never relied on them for money or anything else, there's no real effect here. Now I won't have to plan and pay for their funerals when they die.

&#x200B;

PS- I have nothing against anyone getting a boob job. If I weren't happy with mine, I'd totally consider it, but for some reason my mouth managed its own response in this situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Angry parents ambushed us at our house, screamed and broke things until they were dragged away. They ended up looking like fools, and we're still a happily married couple.

&#x200B;

Edit: My wife filed a police report yesterday, we may pursue a no contact order or something similar, but we have put up a security camera and arranged some pepper spray around the house for quick and easy access. Naturally, if I ever hear from her again, I will update all of you accordingly!"	"Proud of both of you for handling yourselves the way you did. It's very brave to stand your ground especially around parents. So I commend you on your strength. I'm also happy to see your positive takes from this experience. Though I am sad that this is something you two had to deal with. Thank you sis for sharing this. I think it speaks volumes to those that are looking for the courage to be their authentic selves. Hugs and kisses. All the best on your ""wedding day"". My wife are in a similar boat on that front. We married in the courthouse for papers and our love as we couldn't wait, and have our 'wedding' planned for this September. No more taking off my wedding band. It hurts so bad to hide that.
Whoa, that's literally the craziest thing that I've read in a while!

You should think about posting this to r/insaneparents.
Omfg ""at least mine are real"" best response lol
Yeah the MiL needs… something… probably a psychiatric hospital stay if I’m honest. Yikes.

So glad you two are okay! 💙
> “*props for using the correct pronouns*”

I lol’d

These guys are nuts, hope you and your wife are okay OP.
Honestly fuck your FIL for driving your MIL all the way there with plates to smash and then trying to say ""you promised not to go crazy"" like he didn't know exactly what she was going to do. He just wants someone else to blame when he dies alone in a cut-rate retirement home
As someone about to get top augmentation surgery, I personally gotta say I nearly pissed myself laughing imagining your quick and witty response, don't feel one bit bad about it.
I would have lost my shit when she stormed into the house. 

I used to be incredibly patient. This story only validates why we shouldn’t tolerate anything. Long before she appeared on your doorstep unannounced she made it clear she doesn’t respect either of you. 

I would call the police, and at least file a report. It would be nice to have that on record in case it happens again. Tho I would imagine when her local police knock on her door, and explain what she did wrong, it will most likely stop her from doing this ever again. If you don’t, she will most likely come back and do it again. Maybe even behave worse.
You're calmer and you're wife is calmer than I'd ever be if someone insulted my fiancée for being trans. Time for a restraining order! I doubt this is the last time MIL will go bonkers on your doorstep. Expect more. What a nut job. Sounds like my fiancees birth mom! We cut contact with her.
Good for you and your wife!  You are both so lucky to have each other.  

TBH you should probably report her uttering threats to the police anyways.  At the least they will go over to her house and put a little fear into her rage driven brain, and create a paper trail if anyone does ever try physical violence.  Don't underestimate crazy, it's always worse than you think.

My wife and I are in a similar position.  I haven't come out to anyone but my wife, and both our parents are religious.  My dad is fairly progressive but her parents are openly racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful people who only like people who are exactly like them.
[deleted]
Doubt I would have been able to remain calm in a situation like that, super impressive. May you and your wife's relationship only get stronger through this.
Wow. That's incredible, but sadly too believable. The nerve of them to do this on her birthday. Y'all handled it awesomely. I sincerely hope to demonstrate the same strength if ever forced to deal with something similar. Good for the both of you, stay strong and solidarity!
Proud of you and your wife standing up for yourselves

They can suck an ass for the way they treat you but you are valid no matter what :) 🏳️‍⚧️
Honestly this is pretty comedic, makes it clear who’s really the problem. Sorry you’re having to go through all this though ! Glad you have such a sweet supportive wife 💖
And transphobes will say trans people are mentally ill


Sheeeeesh 🙄



In all seriousness I’m so sorry you had to go through something like that, at least the trash took itself out though.
Proud of your wife and you for not putting up with the MIL's bull, and your initial comeback had me cackling. It's hard to stand up to family sometimes, but it seems like your wife and you are a great support to each other, so I guess it's easier that way.
Stay safe, OP, and congrats on the two of you getting that kind of toxicity out of your life. Much love to you both!
“At least mine are real”
*GREAT ENEMY FELLED*
About the boob job comment… I’m enby and took HRT briefly. A relative told me changing how I looked was not god’s plan. She had a breast reduction surgery the previous month since it was causing her back pain. And I looked at her and said “well god didn’t plan for you to have smaller breasts but that didn’t seem to stop you”
You get all the hugs OP. Way to stick it out. And a little bit of sass looks good on you girly
I think you handled it nicely. I want to encourage you to stay nice towards them. They can treat you like shit but they can‘t force you to dirty your hands as well.
I'd get a restraining order against them lol.
I kept expecting a ""and that's when [you/your wife] punched the bitch in the mouth,"" turns out you're more composed than me!
She sounds like a  grandiose narcissist, I love the dish she brought to demonstrate what you are doing to her. She says you are doing this to her family but she really means herself and her idea of what a family is. 

You handled yourselves perfectly, that one smart retort about her fake breasts put her back on her heels, she was not expecting that at all.. why ? Because she felt so %100  confident in her moral highgound she was thrown by your calling her on her imperfect world
I hope you both have endless happiness out of spite for such lowly creatures that shouldn’t even be compared to human.
This makes me so angry. Hopefully you can go no contact.
""At least mine are real""  
GOD THAT'S AMAZING

you go girl, don't feel bad about it, i probably would have said something worse
Ummm… If I ever become so narcissistic and bigoted that I hop in a car, ambush my daughter and try to destroy her relationship ON HER *FUCKING* BIRTHDAY, please dump me into a pool of lava. The sheer audacity of this woman, good grief.
You promised not to go crazy! You promised not to lose your mind!

🤣 Poor guy he probably just wanted to stay home and watch some sport ball too
that was really great and satisfying to read.
well done
Whoa. Great job keeping yourself together. I don’t know how I would react in that sort of situation. Also, nice burn!
You need to get no contact orders of protection against the entire family asap. They will try this again. They will step it up. They are insane, violent, and very dangerous.
Wow that's fucking insane!

Side note: I enjoy the way you wrote everything down. You reminded me of a character in a book , in a good way.
1. Proud of you for responding this way!! As calm as I am generally, if my MiL (or my own mother) acted liked that, I’d be hysterical.

2. I don’t think a response to “nice boobs” (I rolled my eyes so hard when I read that) required anything more polite that how you put it. 
Don’t dish it out if you can’t take it!
Honestly this was kind of nice to hear for a vent. I mean that experience probably was anything but pleasant and your wife maybe doesn't feel too good about her relationship with her parents, but other than that it sounds pretty positive with you two continuing your loving marriage and them straight up making fools of themselves. 
That boob line may be a bit harsh for anyone not deserving of it and I get the feeling of regretting not being able to hold your tongue but in that situation it kinda was a killer comeback. (And as you said it even took the wind out of her sails for a bit.)

Can only wish you two the best ❤✌
So sorry you had to deal with this but it sounds like you both handled it amazingly well. Your MIL is a not a healthy human and, honestly, I just feel bad for her that she can be so corrupted and disconnected from reality. 

I was in a similar situation where my partner's parents were not kind. My recommendation is to support your partner as much as possible and keep communicating. This is likely a very hard time for them. 

I love your boob comment and good on you. With irrationality, sometimes dishing some creative language is the only way to defend yourself and stifle a dangerous situation. 

I'm sending you and your partner all the best, and please be safe!
Funny thing is i had this happen but with my own parents they drove 6 hours to my place while my wife was home and i was at work so when i got home they tried to get me to move back and talk to a pastor lmao
Please take care of yourselves. I can’t believe people still behave like this. It’s 2022 ffs 😢 

Why can’t people let other be who they want and live who they want. X
It’s really nice to see that your spouse continues to support you in the face of their family. That is an incredibly challenging thing for someone to do. Even when their family comprises of psychotic cunts.
As someone who cut their parents out of their lives 7 years ago I would advise your wife to do the same. You can love your parents with all their faults and also have zero relationship with them. It’s not worth either of your mental health to have to deal with people like that. Just because someone is family doesn’t give them the right to treat you poorly. It’s truly liberating once you do it and realize how much stress is reduced in your life. If family truly loved you they would disagree with your choices but at the same time respect them and not act like this. I hope both of you have a great life together.
How did you manage to not burst out laughing when they said not to get married?
That is unfortunately - there is an increase of fascism, racist and cynicism growing in out country - glad you still together and let us hope progressive thinking wins this what I see war
Holy woah. Those are some wild in laws. I’m so sorry that happened to you - but major kudos to you and your wife for taking it so well!
Also your MIL sounds totally batshit MY GOD 😅
It's these kinds of stories that make me terrified to come out, and have no idea how to get HRT and not be homeless. You are amazing to have been able to put up with that crazy bitch, and I hope you never have to experience this again
op that was the best clap back.
While there’s nothing wrong with the boob job, the comment was certainly well placed. Seems to have shaken up her own confidence a bit, and told her that this wasn’t going to be a situation where she’d just be able to say or do anything she wanted. Shifted the power to you. So I think it was a good thing to have said anyway.
This is obviously a horrible thing to deal with but my takeaways from this are all positive. You sound like you are happy in your journey of self discovery and your identity and relationship and you have great support from your wife. That is the most important and is inspiring to read and makes me happy. Second you stood your ground without getting too aggressive or physical. It sounds like the incident could’ve gone way worse and you handled it great. So did your wife. Plus now you have all these pent up feelings getting a bit of release, they saw the real you and you don’t have to pretend any more. Also you seem to have cut ties with a toxic relationship for your wife and yourself. Just be sure your wife gets whatever support she needs cause it’s her family, but I’m confident you are already doing that. I hope you feel all the positives from this and take pride in your strength and your marriage and your future. A lot of times I read stories on here that make me worried or sad for the person and this just made me happy and inspired and optimistic for your future! I wish you and your wife all the best for your lives together though I don’t even think you really need any help, you seem to be doing great.
Sorry you had to go through this. On the bright side, your wife sounds awesome!
>""at least mine are real""

OP you are my new hero
Maybe I'm so used to managing other people's feelings but if I was in your shoes my first priority would be to make sure my wife is okay.

I am estranged from toxic family that gets explosive like this and it takes years and years to process the trauma. Their transphobia is in no way excusable and I think you did a fantastic job of showing that you won't be pushed around for their stupid ideals. 

Take care of yourself, then take care of your wife. She lost her parents today. Even if she felt like she lost them a long time ago, the day I made my estrangement official changed how I felt quite dramatically, even though I already wasn't talking to them or sharing anything. 

I'm glad you're okay and the MIL stopped when she did. Monsters.
And they call us dramatic 😭
Is it really loading control when you planned to do it hours in advance?

I mean, it sounds like the FiL believed she wasn't gonna, but she knew she was gonna have a fit when she bought those plates.
Personally not bodyshaming is only for people, and bigots aren’t people
Love the ""atleast mine are real"" comment, best I've gotten to use is "" atleast mine are fresh and perky, untouched by the hands of dozens""
""Nice boob job"" I just love that special brand of misogyny cis women reserve for trans women.
Your wife is an absolute boss!!  Wow

Also unbelievable catty instincts 🔥

The boob zing was sooooo solid
well. congrats on both of you for staying reasonably calm and mature in that situation, im glad neither of you were injured and that you dont rely on them for anything at all.

i hope your wife had a nice enough birthday despite that, and hope that she isnt too emotionally hurt by her family xx
Wooow. You're a hero, OP!
Honestly you should notify the police about this and get some kind of incident report just so you have a paper trail started in case she decides to do something even more unhinged.
Doesn’t sound like you lost control. Sounded like you honestly and clearly stated your boundaries.
Oh goodness sending hugs and astral projected tacos!  I am sorry you had to go through this
That’s awesome that you and your wife stick by each other like that. I don’t think I could have been this calm if someone insulted my fiancé. We are both mtf, and I know my parents are very conservative, so I have not even told them about our relationship yet. Much love sis.
Yall handled it perfectly! 

I would get done house cameras. We have blink from Amazon after my brother went off the deep end. It’s reasonably affordable compared to what’s on the market and motion activated, hooked to WiFi and you use an app on your phone. 

Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people and your safety (and your wife’s) is paramount.  It wouldn’t surprise me if she comes back and does property damage.
Amazing story. Good luck with the rest of your transition
I would also add that the one thing I hate about this which in fact may hurt your wife but does makes your decision easier is that your MIL is putting her moral values and judgments above her daughter, they are more important then her daughter. They never got to know you at all before they found out. And they just bring the hammer down on both of you with no attempt at trying to understand who you are and what you are doing. It's all very impersonal to you and it's all about her.
Good for both of you! You each stood up and didn’t tolerate what was being thrown your way! Now if I could do the same and stand my ground with my in laws…le sigh. I’m FtM and yeah…they don’t approve of it. I met my wife before I started transitioning too, took them awhile to get used to their daughter being with a woman! Anyway!

Proud of you! Keep it up and don’t take anyones crap! 🧡
Holy fuck, that’s awful of them. Absolute Trash Bags™️, full stop. Kudos to you and your wife, the strength and perseverance you two have is a testament to real love. 🏳️‍⚧️😎
I just wanna say congratulations on standing your ground. Screw that crazy lady.
Oh. My. God.

I absolutely lost it at your father in law saying *""You promised not to go crazy"".*
And this is exactly what I'd be afraid of my parents doing if they ever found out. We certainly can't choose our family, but you'd think our family would choose us over their ignorant bigotry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it seems like you and your wife are handling it just fine so far. 💜
Kinda sounds worth getting a restraining order against the people who might be physically dangerous to you. I wouldn't expect police to take action for a ""family member showing up to your house"" unless you can also say they're not allowed to by law. You could diffuse the threat by telling those people that the restraining order is just for your safety, and if they want to bridge the gap, you can talk about it over text.

It is better to be safe than sorry
So sorry you had to deal with that. 

Honestly it sounds like you handled it incredibly well. Props. Not sure I would be able to remain that calm and reasonable.
Wow!!  That woman is a serious nut job.  Credit to you for standing your ground and refusing to be bullied.
I'd look into an order of protection. This doesn't sound like it will de-escalate. Sounds like she's rallying the troops for round 2.
I was literally talking to my therapist about my birth family today, and how I would probably never be able to come out to them, as they attacked and still don't respect my ex, who came out as a trans man at the time. While I know for a fact that I would only be making things bad by telling them, it still hurts a little to think that I can't tell them and have supportive, loving, non-hateful family members to talk with, go shopping with and invite over to see thier new gorgeous (IMO) daughter and maybe help her find her new style.
did i miss the part where you “lost control”? as far as you’ve written you said a single thing to the MIL. you were as cool as a cucumber from what i read!
am so, so sorry you had to go through this nightmare. you are so incredibly resilient in the way you handled the situation, though! hoping for the best for you and your wife! 💜
Congrats on getting married! And honestly your clapbacks were great. ""At least mine are real"" is a banger.

On a scale from 1 to ""hackles raised,"" what's the likelihood of them following through on whatever threats your mil made in her meltdown? They sound like empty threats from a madwoman, but I want to be sure you two are proper safe.
Don't deploy pepper spray indoors, pro tip from a seasoned security guard, just taze them
Uhhhh i read some real threats of physical violence in there. If you're willing, able and can afford it... if it were me... id get a g*n and make a safety plan for who to call and where to go in case shit pops off
First co grats on coming out and I hope you have a good transition. Second atleast mine are real made me fucking laugh so hard
Fuck your parents. I laughed at ""Well at least mine are real"".
I mean your a woman soooo *swing her by the roots of her hair 😈*
I feel like these are the kind of people who actually need “conversion therapy” and by that i really just mean a proper education on why all of those assumptions are baseless and misunderstandings of who trans people are.
Well they seem to be threatening your well being so I would consider making preparations to defend yourself. It almost sounds like she is threatening to like get her family to attack you. If you live in a place where you can get learn firearm safety and your right about defending yourself and get a gun. If you can't get a gun maybe a knife or really anything. Cause they do seem to want you hurt.
Honestly this is why I'm not that into the whole family thing. My brother is an ass and if he shows up at my house I'm calling the cops. 

So disappointing. I'm glad you guys were prepared but I'm still sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda called the cops
Thank you for sharing, it was educational!
That's awful! I can't understand how some people can be like that. Props to you two for staying strong during it all and let Love win! Also props to your writing skills. This was surprisingly easy to imagine. Ever considered writing as a profession?
I’m sorry you had to go through that. Also I’m oddly pleasantly surprised the dad was basically there to manage the mom and didn’t say much?
Hugs to you both!
Good response, 10/10 meow. Making us proud OP.
Woah sounds like something straight from a horror movie! Sorry you had to deal with that!
I am littrally going through the exact same thing now apart they found out off other people and now I’m the worlds worst and my gf is making the worst decision of her life blah blah blah
Tbh while my parents are homophobic for the most part  cus some people in my family are gay and I myself is Trans but hiding it. If someone did this to me I'd be the person saying they need to leave or I get the sniper to take the shot. Kinda like a way to avoid being followed
Wow. I'm impressed with how you handled the whole thing. I would have probably lost it. Lots of love and happiness to the both of you
Time to file a restraining order against them.
Just to let you know I'm happy for you both. And don't let people like your wife's mom and dad Get you down.
My goodness what a read! You handled that better than I would of (I only just came to the conclusion I am Trans, lots of things to think about) but your wife is amazing too! She handled that so well. It is never easy when family are not open-minded. My father (if he was still in the picture) would have lashed out badly. I commend you both on how that was addressed and wish you both a happy future together. Your comeback to her was sublime and by all means justified.
>She said that her mind was broken

She was not wrong. But it wasn't broken for the reasons she implied.
Word of advice: call the cops early.

It takes a minute for then to get to you and if things go south it’s better for them to already be on their way.

Cops would much, MUCH, rather deal with cases where they can intervene early and prevent paperwork from needing to be filed than fallout after-the-fact.

Stay safe
I am so sorry you both went through this. I think if this is really what her parents are like she could consider going no contact. That was straight-up narcissistic rage.
Yup, this is the craziest shit I've heard in a hot minute. Damn, girl. I'm so sorry. I hope y'all are hanging in there 💕
I’m not sure what country/area you’re from, but if it’s the US, please consider getting a gun. 

This woman is clearly planning on hurting you herself or pushing another family to do it for her.

A police order and pepper spray won’t do much if somebody shows up armed at your home looking to harm you and your wife.
This is more or less my biggest fear about being out to my extended family… I have a lunatic grandmother who has done things, including, but not limited to: kidnapping the bride at a wedding that she apposed, trying to get my parents to divorce (twice), and screaming at everyone in the household over me saying one swear word (damn) and leaving in a rush. I’m terrified that she would haul her ass up from the south just to try and stop me from being me.

I’m glad you made it out of this situation. I hope I don’t have to go through something similar.
Thank you for the kind words! Idk if this post will help anyone else, but it was nice to at least vent a bit. Moving forward, the best thing is we no longer have to hide who we are from anyone, and no more awful family gatherings! Last one I went to I lost like 5 pounds from anxiety induced nausea, which isn't something I've ever had before. I hope your wedding goes really well, and you get to wear whatever you want walking down the aisle!
Yeah, it probably does belong there, but I feel like this community might be able to relate to it as well. I don't think I've ever had someone hate me as vehemently as this woman does, so that's a new experience! We're locking our doors a lot more these days
Thanks for the award, btw! I don't think I've ever gotten one before, at least not one I know about, so that's pretty cool
Posting this to a non-trans sub will draw in the transphobes like vultures to a fresh carcass.
That is the harshest thing I've heard in a while but kinda deserved ngl.
Yeah, a psychiatrist said it sounds like she has some undiagnosed and untreated mental illness, but it's never good to diagnose second hand. Maybe this will cause her to get the help she needs, but probably not. That's her problem now, though!
I figure it'll be a few weeks/months before my heart rate stops skyrocketing every time there's someone walking past our house, but the relief from not having to deal with them will last forever!
Lol- kinda my thoughts as well, my wife had a point when she said that at least he was largely in control of his conduct and emotions, but I pointed out how low the bar is if being a slightly quieter bigot is all it takes to get praise.
My wife filed a police report yesterday, to basically do what you said and establish a record of her behavior. If something else does happen, hopefully that record will make any future legal actions easier. I don't plan on pursuing anything as long as she never comes back, but I'll still prepare!
My wife filed a report yesterday after we cooled off which was probably a good idea. I hope if/when you do end up having that conversation, they at least don't act violently!

One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when I described how the first time I met them, they were talking about how bs it was that the Confederate flag couldn't be flown above state capitol buildings, and her dad's response was that he didn't recall that event, but ""yeah, obviously we support it, we are conservatives"". I was like, yeah, so maybe you can see why we were hesitant to tell you guys at first?
One juicy bit I forgot to add, but you may appreciate. At one point, she gestured around us (to our house, flowers, plant stand, front yard, pride flag, etc) and asked, ""Does this look like happiness to you?"" My wife and I just laughed and were like, you mean living our lives in peace with friendly neighbors? Yeah, this definitely looks like happiness to us. She goes, ""well, it may look like that now, but give it time. Things can change!"" And I said, yes, HRT has been a lot of changes, and they've all been really positive! I've definitely become way happier, so I hope that change keeps on coming!
You're definitely right, it took some effort to not write a snarky text to her, but it's not worth stooping to her level.
That's the hope! Unfortunately that seems to be largely up to her, and she has nothing to do all day other than stew in her own anger, so idk what to expect. I know they own a gun, so I've got pepper spray strategically located throughout the house. Plus some fire extinguishers in case arson is afoot...
I was thinking this too, like how was mil able to text on the way home? Block block block
Oh, it was tough! Especially once I realized their main goal was to stop the wedding from happening, it just became so clear how impotent their rage was. Like, I couldn't help you if I wanted, it's too late. We already did the big gay
I agree, I am more shaken up by it than I thought I'd be, but it's definitely even more personal and tougher to process for my wife. It took my mom a while to come around, but her reaction was nothing like this, so I can only imagine how it feels when your own blood is saying things like that to you. We are helping each other as best we can, plus therapy, so I think we'll get through it!
I'm kinda wondering if I'll find some fresh paint on our house or cars. I'm pretty handy, so hopefully I can deal with any damage she tries to cause, but we did also set up a camera and we're locking the doors all the time now, and the dogs are on high alert!
Yeah, I've certainly considered it, but honestly idk if I can justify the cost at the moment. I did put pepper spray all over the house, plus our dogs are kinda scary, so I'm hoping that plus home field advantage will play in our favor. Plus she's got bad joints, so I think I've got her beat 100% if we take it to the ground
[deleted]
That was my wife's reaction as well, he definitely had some opinions of his own but managed to keep his cool. If he hadn't been there, I doubt she would have left so soon or so easily, so probably good that he was!
Wow, yeah, that's very intense! Honestly I just don't see where they get the energy to be so damn angry. Not caring is the easiest thing to do! I hope you don't have to deal with her, she sounds like a menace
You’re probably right tbh. I wouldn’t venture too far out of trans spaces with trans stories. Because there are a lot of people on Reddit who want to make our lives permanently miserable or worse.
Yeah unfortunately I've already seen that sub in particular side with bigoted parents of trans kids/adults and giving them all the unwarranted uwus of ""ooohh but it's a big change for them give them time,"" so I would definitely stear clear of posting this to other subs. Alas. It does have very r/justnomil vibes too tho lol. 

Anyways, proud of both you and your wife, OP. You did good.
If you don't have security cameras, now might be a good opportunity to install some and a setup to store footage so you can keep an eye on things both remotely and to have a paper trail in case the MIL escalates things or contacts some irrational male relatives to harass y'all.
NP, yinz earned that:)

Stay safe!
Too true! Can’t help people who don’t want to be helped.
Maybe some outdoor cameras would be a good measure? Then if they ever show back up again, just immediately call the cops. :( I’m sorry you’re in this hypervigilant state because of her craziness. That shit is the worst…
Yeah it really is a low bar. Though if nothing else, at least them each reacting in that way led to the conversation ending before it went further. Your FIL being quiet and perhaps a bit embarrassed probably saved you a lot of headache.

If they both flipped out things could get scary, and if they both tried to be quiet but condemning, you could be dealing with passive aggressive bs for weeks on end before it reached a boiling point.

Wish you guys luck and mad respect to your wife for standing up for herself, her decisions and for you. It's horrible what her parents are doing to her by making this an issue at all and it takes a good backbone to recognize it's them, not her, not you, in the wrong here.

Side note, I'd be super tempted to use the shards of those plates to make some cool artsy thing after painting them with trans colors just to spite your MIL. xP
Sounds like you handled everything the best way possible. Hopefully you’re done with that bs.
💖
Thats incredibly scary jesus christ. Id suggest buying a gun if you think they are that serious about harming u lile thay
“We already did *the big gay*”

My favourite Reddit quote to ever exist
Did you get to rub that in their faces?!? Oh I wish you had recorded their faces if so!! 

I'm so sorry lovely that this is happening. But you and your wife sound awesome and wonderfully supportive of each other. 💜
I would get a couple more cameras. The proof will help should anything happen.  Please stay safe!
You could install dummy cameras and motion sensor lights, those are cheap and can be enough to make someone think twice. Maybe reinforce the doors with a second deadbolt
Mossberg 500, if I may be so bold as to make a suggestion.
I'd rather be judged by 12 than carried by 9. That's our reality out here so stfu and stay in your lane
Yep. Have had good experiences with people in my country's subreddit but I really don't recommend that to anyone else lol
Whoa! A yinzer! Have an Imp n Arn on me! 😁
I think it's a possibility, unlikely but plausible. I plan to tell the neighbors as well so they know what to look out for.
How did you make it MORE american
Yup. I’ve seen a lot of users experience that. I knew my my home state and town’s subs would be a toxic cesspit. So I don’t even bother. 

Too bad too. I’m sure I could meet a lot of wonderful queer people on there.
You from the Nor'side?
https://www.huffpost.com/entry/groomer-panic-idaho-white-supremacists-lgbtq_n_62acc960e4b06594c1d6348b
You're right, this is hilarious actually
It's also a bad idea to frequent your home town subs on your main account (especially if you're queer) so that bigots can't pinpoint where you live
Morgantown, actually, but all my college pals were Yinzers.

my partner bought me gender affirming clothes!!!		"Ohhh I really love your skirt. Are those pockets?!
With the forced-perspective sloping ceiling, all I can think of is that one song from Steven Universe...
You look so happy 😁
You're looking so good
Good for you! You look fantastic
Your partner is awesome, I love that skirt, and from one long drink of water to another, you look great!
So cute!  I love that skirt on you!  It sounds like you have a great partner.
how cute!
You have an awesome partner! My wife has been my biggest cheerleader through my transition. I wish you that kind of love and support.
So sweet! You look wonderful and I’m glad you have such a lovely and supportive partner ❤️
And they look great on you too! Congratulations 🙂
Omg I'm so jealous lol, that skirt is amazing, hope you have a great day 🥰

That’s awesome!
I know it's an odd compliment but your legs are nice af
WOW you’re all legs 🦵 okay, model! stunning
What does gender affirming mean? To be rooted into a gender? Does this imply what said gender would traditionally wear, that this makes you seem more like this gender? Sorry, I am learning still😅
You’re so cute!! So happy for both you and your partner 💚
Love it!
What a mega babe! 😍🥰
You and your partner are so lucky to have each other 
🥰
Probably fake pockets, the more 'pockets' look like pockets on 'femme' clothes, the more likely they probably aren't 🙈🙃

I can see the resemblance too.
😘😘😘
🥰 I've been lucky.

Ngl I thought it was just a random pic of a woman and I was confused why it was in my feed until I saw the sub. I’m honestly shocked this is pre-transition.
You look so cute

You look like my cousin who is a cis female, I don’t know if that’s an insult to say or a compliment but I intended no offense if it’s the former! Just making an observation!
I remember my first time before I realized and then the first time after I came out. Both amazing experiences, I can imagine the joy you must feel. You are beautiful, valid, and gorgeous.
You kind of remind me of Debby Ryan
you look amazing!
Cute!!
Ummm, adorable 😊💜

It’s clear to me that if you weren’t born that way you were supposed to be a female you have a beautiful smile and a very feminine face

So pretty like 🤩🤩 you are gorgeous
you look like the rival love interest from a mid 2010s elliot page movie.
You look very pretty and feminine. I especially like the side swept bangs and beanie
You look great!
Currently trying to figure out how to do eye make-up myself haha
You look like f1nnster, which isnt an insult he is the most feminine looking guy.
You can’t be telling me this is pre-everything, YOU LOOK AMAZING!
*Crowd starts chanting* TAKE IT OFF TAKE IT OFF TAKE IT OFF

Cute. What about the rest?
CUTIE! you look amazing! Love your bangs!

Suuuuuper cute!
Cute, they look good on you 😊
Goals
U LOOK AMAZING!!!
You look amazing. Soo happy for you!
Beautiful! So unremarkably beautiful! ❤️
You look amazing! But there’s no such thing as women’s or men’s clothes. Clothes have no gender :)
I think you should do that all the time
You look lovely... try to just think of them as Your Clothes sweetie. YOU make the clothes look good! 💋🦊
You look great and girly, without having to use layers of make up and jewelry, etc. You look naturally feminine.
Time to *burp  goo-* on an adventure morty
Thanks 🙏
Wow seriously, thats such a nice thing to say. Thank you 😊
Thats not the first time i’ve been told that
That's what I was thinking too
Yesss
Awww man. Thats really nice of you to say. But i’m pre everything and don’t get to be a girl all the time. So you probably wouldn’t lol
Power of makeup behold
Same here. Before I read the subreddit I was like, why is a woman in women's clothing showing up on my feed? I'm envious though, for sure.
How’s it wild?

I’m not transitioning based on looks thanks, if i wanted to be a boy i’d be a boy no matter how good i looked as a girl. Like f1nn for example
Okay. I don’t care.

Its not r/transpassing
Lol, no. 41% is for people who haven’t transitioned and aren’t accepted. Luckily i am. Also, those rates significantly decrease once people have transitioned. But i bet you didn’t know that since you’ve probably done no other research outside of that one meme you seen on a right wing sub. Now please leave this place, you aren’t wanted ☺️

Thats actually my light in my room pretty much, its still kinda cold out lol

I really only ever feel like me when i’m like this, when i’m not i spend my time wishing i could do it. So when i do, I actually feel comfortable for once. Also women’s clothes are so much more comfortable compared to mens.

Uh huh
Yeah your right, clothes are clothes. But i meant like in general
Honestly though. They make a ton of difference. They definitely make me look more feminine. Plus I’ve actually lost a lot of weight, i’m not quite where i want to be yet. I usually hate being trans, but you know things are good rn. I can look in the mirror and be proud to call that me.
Aw jeez... I don’t know Rick, its kinda late
It’s true! I love your hair. My hair does this thing where it goes darker and then lighter over the years. It’s currently weirdly blondish brown and I miss when it was darker like yours. 😊
Wait, you’re not Finn? Could’ve fooled me lol. 

But in all seriousness you look so cute I can’t even. You’re straight up goals for me.
You have a really nice starting point
I'm literally exactly in that position!
I would not have been able to tell tbh! I’m jealous of how pretty you are!!
Fuck not even. You just naturally have an incredibly feminine face. Like have you seen your jaw line and itty bitty nose??
You know who I'm talking about? It's a twitch streamer who cross dresses (hes cis) but still ends up passing better than me lmao. I said it's wild cuz ya both cute 😍

I know exactly what you mean. It's amazing how something so small and insignificant can't make you feel valid and so euphoric.

You give yourself far too much credit. You forehead is definitely feminine.
Make up is miraculous
Seriously though. Not even that, the shape of your face, nose, and lips is gorgeous
We're all still just works in progress sweetie. Do you and on Your schedule. There's no rush and it sounds like you're beginning to enjoy the journey lol. That's what I think matters. Aligning our inner beauty with our outer beauty takes time but, the view thru our own eyes is still the most important. Proud of you sweetie, I hope you are too. 💋🦊

You look so cute in them! :D
You look amazing! Also, I love the ears!

you look cool
You look amazing in that outfit, and your parents seem amazing
So handsome, that vest looks great on you! 😊
You look handsome as fuck man! They are very dapper. Congrats
first pic u look like hobbit Tom Scott explaining a highly advanced and contested concept within arcane theory to me /pos
Unsolicited advice, and stop reading if you don't want it.

You might want to consider looking for a shirt with a smaller collar, not sure if that one can be taken in. I wouldn't want to go any bigger than that one on you. It's not bad, could be a little better. Consult a tailor if you can, custom tailored clothes are definitely an upscale men's thing. Best of luck to you!
Damm that looks nice you got some style
Not everyone can pull off a vest, but you’re killing it, dude! 

Any plans on when you’ll wear them out for the first time?
You ever seen Jojo’s Part 6? You remember Jolyne’s lawyer? The ears mixed with the outfit makes it really hard for me to see anything else!


Jokes aside, the outfit looks great! I myself need femme business clothes
Oh no a handsome elf! My one weakness!
I legit thought we were friends bc I have a transmasc friend and he really looks like you. I got excited at first but then realized Im not out to him as transfem so things might have been kinda weird lol
Silly nerd boy.
Your folks are cool & you too!
So coot 😍😍😍
you look so good!

Lookin good. I hope this is a 1st step towards your parents being better about things.

You are.
I’m so happy that your parents are supportive of you!!! You look lovely!

I look at these pics, the ears, no shoes... and you saying your parents aren't much supportive... and I think: ""Did you tell them you needed it for a Hobbit cosplay?""😭 I hope I don't offend you, but you definitely look like you're about to steal some mushrooms with merry and pippin (in all the good ways)
Elf ears
Do you identify as an elf?
u look like a retarded elf
just remember SAM is your lifelong friend and Gollum is an addict who will tell you *anything* to get whats he wants

My elf accountant explaining to me why it's too early to be thinking about investing in stocks.

It's a start; give them time.
It shows progress though. Hopefully they continue growing in the right direction.
I intended it as such 😊
Hey!

How did it go at school with the vest and slacks?
Well, a win is a win, you look suave as fuck dude.
I'm just saying you have a bit of a boss vibe
If you go to the main subreddit page there's 3 dots to the right of the search bar. Click that and then it's user flair
No, just noticed a similarity lol. Sorry if I offended
That shirt and waistcoat combo 👌🏼 😍
jolly good! Magic is in real need of proper control! carry on!
High school??? Ah shit my bad, I'm sorry. I really need to stop making stupid jokes ;;;

Also, good luck on the basically chef. Doing a hell of a lot better than i ever did.

First time buying a dress in store	I got the courage to go shopping in store for clothing and trying them on with my friend. She picked this dress out for me and I loved it immediately 😍	"And it is suiting you so well , you are so damn cute in it I am so happy for you and so proud , you are doing amazing and I love your hair , again you look stunning in it and I hope you are doing amazing and you are happy <3
such a pretty dress, kind of wish I could have it too lol
Fuck that dress is so pretty. I love dresses but hate them because gender dysphoria.
That door is almost as short as the public toilet doors
That dress is gorgeous and so are you! So happy for you, girl🥰🥰🥰
It's a very pretty dress, I hope you bought it! 😍
Pretty pretty dresss
Scrolling, saw the image, didn’t see the sub didn’t read the title thought it was one of those sewing subs where some seamstress was showing off a self drafted dress she made for herself, scrolled up because she was cute and so was the dress and I wanted to know the pattern so I could pick it up, and well here we are.  She is cute, and I get no pattern so boo
Very cute :)

I've dreamed I could wear something similar, but reality and dreams are 2 different things lol.
Isn’t it amazing what you can find in second hand shops 😘
It took them until I actually started HRT before they actually realised this is who I want to be, but now they are pretty supportive
So happy to hear that I am so happy for you and go on keep you head up and remember to smile you are an amazing person <3"	104qp37	trans	2579	0.95	2023-01-06 10:17:44
Ftm. Guys i came out to my bi boyfriend and he immediately accepted me omg	He said he'll be with me every step of my transition and he told his sister and she wants to take me shopping for boy clothes 😍	"that's awesome man! good job bro 😎
Congratulations! Few things in life are more fulfilling than a loving family, even if its a family-by-choice.

Boy clothes are built to last so make sure you really like what you buy. The quality difference is just astounding.
I'm glad he was willing to accept you! I hope everything works out, both in your relationship and in your transition!
Welcome to having pockets
Dude thats great!
The power of bi boyfriend uWu

Congratulations bud.
I am really happy for you!!
Omg this gives me hope. I really need to come out to my boyfriend.
awwww that’s so sweet! Congrats
That's really awesome.

He definitely sounds like a keeper. :D
I'm so happy for you bro, i hope you find some awesome clothing
YES
That's great :)
Goals
So happy for you dude! You deserve it
this makes me so happy to hear <3 it truly brightened my day
Omg I'm literally so happy for you man!  good job taking that step, its never easy esp when its someone as close as a bf. So good for you being strong, and I'm glad you have people to hold you up! :) <3
Congrats and good luck on the journey ahead! It’s always amazing to have supportive friends and family :D
That's great news‼️‼️
I’m so proud of you! Congrats!!!
That makes me so happy too hear!!!! Having a partner like that makes the transition so much better, especially knowing that they have your back through it all! 🥰🏳️‍⚧️
Duuuuude, that's awesome
that's awesome! congratulations
That's amazing!!
congrats!!!
Excited for you!!  🙂
That’s amazing!!! I’m so happy for you!
Yaaaay! Congrats, bro!!
comgrats man!
That’s so awesome I’m only out to my bi fiancé too and he is on board but scared to tell anyone else :(
Congrats
Congrats to you my dude. Nothing makes me happier than seeing someone be accepted immediately. I’m sure you’ve need nervous and worried about this for a while. I hope it’s a bit relief. Good luck on your journey.
Congrats, that's awesome!!!
Dude!!!! This is such incredible news!! I’m so happy for you! 💙
So happy or you! I (MtF/NB) came out to my bi partner and she's been so incredibly supportive
That is amazing!! Congrats!!

If it matters much, on of my favorite looks on a man is Jean's and Flannel. Or a nice pair of sweatpants on lazy days at home
People can surprise you. So happy for you. Tales like this make my day. Like my fiancé when I came out as trans (mtf) she said she was marrying me. Not my gender and would still marry me.
*inaudible happy noises*
On another happier note, my daughter loves it that I go dress shopping with her now 😂
Omg if thst isn't the cutest most adorable thing ever
That’s amazing my dude! I’m so glad :)
That’s amazing! I love when I get to hear stories like these. Wish you both nothing but the best!!! 🥳😊🥰
Bro that's so so awesome! I hope you can get some nice handsome clothes when shopping! I so happy for you that it went so well <3 
Have a queer evening my dude!
Congrats!! I found that my partner's support has been by far the best. Best of luck to you both !! 💞💖
Your relationship sounds so strong! I had the same with my gf (I’m non binary) and we’re together to this day! Good luck in future!!
Yayayayayyyyyy awesome!!!
Ayer congrats! I came out to my bi boyfriend too in Feb :) Bi boys are the best
Kickass man! That's fucking dope. I'm so happy for you all 😊
Dude that’s great!! I’m so happy for you :))
Yayyy
Congratulations!
Same situation, my bf told about me for his ex-gf and she want help me choose female clothes and make makeup with manicure 😅
Tfw suddenly a boyfriend

https://youtu.be/XO5sLMx4W1w
I’m really jealous. I came out to my bi wife and she’s trying to take the kids from me because I’m a “sexual deviant” /: some people have no class.
That's amazing! It's nice when you've got people who support you
That is amazing!!!
That’s so so good omg! Happy for you :)
That is wonderful! SO nice to hear good things happening still.
Thanks. I can't wait 😊
I know. Most of my family is kinda shit but my chosen family is amazing. On the boy clothes i know. I bought a mens tracksuit and its great and omg the pockets are HUGE. Its amazing
Thanks ☺️ i hope so too. He's so great i can't believe i was lucky enough to meet him
They're so big holy shit it's crazy. I won't feel bad about getting rid of my bags
Ikr. I knew he was a really good guy but holy shit this is on another level. I'm falling for him way to early but idgaf he's an incredible person.
Yep. He's amazing. Thank you
Thanks me too
Do it. He'll accept you or not. Either way it might be best to get it over with. I was shit scared to come out to mine and it turned out really well. Best of luck to you
Ik he's the sweetest man I've ever met
He definitely is
I've found plenty. My bank account isn't happy about it though haha
All these lovely responses brightened mine 💗
He's a genuinely brilliant guy. I know he's got my back through anything. It makes everything seem a lot less scary.
I knooooow 😁
Thank you :)
Mate same. Only him and my mom know cause my siblings will 100% disown me when i tell them. I need to bite the bullet and get it over with but damn it is scary
Thanks. It's a huge relief. Good luck on your journey too :)
Bi people are fucking great. Well most people are great but bi people are extra great
Haha yeah i'm eyeing some flannel shirts. Gonna buy them when i get paid
Congratulations. It's great to find accepting people
Yay for family shopping trips 😁
Mtf. I miss pockets.
Mtf here, I just donated a bunch of boy clothes to my label-free lover. She put on some jeans and was passed about how deep the pockets were compared to her old clothes, but it got funny passed when I pointed out you could easily put an entire water bottle in one and a small book in the other and still have room to spare. 

I'm gonna repeat what a bunch of people have said; feminine fashion is designed thinner, less durable, and with less pockets. This is to encourage (in the same order as above) layering, constant changing of styles, and accessories such as purses to carry things. 

It would be much infuriating if I didn't look so darn cute in it all, but sacrifices must be made to please my inner princess 😹
Thank you! I will! Im already making plans. Fingers crossed that it will turn out alright <3
Might not be happy right away. But when a pair of jeans can last 3-5 years quite easily. 
Even had a few pairs last nearly 10 years before I donated them as I was changing my wardrobe.
Definitely scary . Ugh
Her love changed my life. I seriously wish what I have for everyone. 😇🙏
I miss pockets and sleeping on my stomach.
I'm gonna give away all my clothes too once i get new ones. That makes sense about womens fashion. But still they should have pretty girly clothes with big sexy pockets too.
Damn those are some good jeans.
Levi's and Wranglers"	necbep	trans	2458	0.98	2021-05-17 10:10:49
Going to keep reminding you silly mtf kids.	"We are girls when we're not wearing makeup.
We are girls when we're not wearing clothes.
We are girls when we're wearing ""boy clothes.""
We are girls when we haven't shaved.
We are girls when our voices are deep.
We are girls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We are girls.  We are loved.  We are valid.


EDIT:  Wow...this blew up a bit.  I'm so glad I could brighten the days of so many of you.  ❤️"	"God I needed this today. Thank you! Validating words can have a huge impact on a day even if it’s from a stranger on Reddit.
Thank you!
Eh, then theres all the internal mental stuff do deal with. Self image got too stressful so i deleted it, and i cant ever go into a deep thought without falling into a spiral of nihilism and hate so i try to ignore it. I dont think about the future because i know it means nothing and will be unforgiving and extremely difficult as is everything with human life and that i will never get a day where i look forward to something.
Dysphoria has been kicking the shit out of me recently and it's been getting too much. I really needed this. Thank you
Yes, all of this. While there is always more I want, I see how far I've come and I'm pretty grateful for just having the chance late in life to transition. It just didn't exist as an option for me when I was younger. I have enough life experience to know you roll with the punches and to accept what life hands you. I'm my case it was a gift, and while I may be an imperfect girl, I still revel in it.  It needs constant reminding, as do all my practices but I ~~suit~~ dress-up each morning and greet the day. Thanks for your reminder.
To all my sister's,YOU. ARE. VALID. Have a nice day :3
Whatever works for you works for you and I don't mean this as an attack on anyone's validity whatsoever. But for me, it's not as easy as this. I don't feel that I've ""earned"" it yet. I aspire to it, I want to be more feminine, I want to be seen as and treated as a girl. But I'm not there yet. Wanting to be female is not all that it takes for me to feel valid as a trans woman.
Transgirl tomboys are pretty cute.
Heck yeah we are! We're awesome girls all the way! :-)
Thank you. I always feel like I'm not fem enough, and it doesn't help that my family is transphobic. I feel like my body is boy, and all I'll ever be is boy.
thank you this made me tear up
♡
Ty for that. 😊
I needed that. Thanks
Thanks so much for this, it’s really made my day C:
I really needed this right now thank you, I've been struggling with a lot of issues and I really appreciate the post
Thank you :)
Thank you, I needed this
you are now my favourite person on the planet amd you didnt even have to do that much to be it
Thank you kind stranger. I somehow needed this. Kinda everyday, but especially when your first feeling out this strange new world of actually beginning to feel happy and like who you should be for the first time in your life. Thes kind words have made me feel welcome and alive. Valid and accepted. You don't know me, but allow me to say that your words made a deep impact that words cannot describe.
Thank you, it had been three hours sense I had felt ""girl enough"" and my brain was like ""who left this doubt here?"" I probably need to not stay up this late...
Well, maybe being genderfluid, I'm not a girl 100% of the time, but close enough that your words of validation resonate with me.
I think that I really needed to hear that right now. Thank you so much!
I only feel like I can believe this when I'm at my computer screen and not being confronted with my appearance/voice

But thank you for this important message ;.;

It's a good message to spread <3
mwa
Why cant I just feel like one tho. My brain is fucking dumb
I'm not mtf but I completely agree with this. You girls don't have to be 100% feminine all the time. You're still girls no matter what <3
You had me till you said we are loved, speak for yourself
Fukkn A 😉👌
thanks. it’s been a little annoying lately what with my family still calling me by my deadname
Eh I mean it’s nice to hear but I’m not sure how much it really helps but like thanks.
How dare you make me feel valid!?
preach ^^^^^ 💜
Yaaaasss!  This everyday all day!  There’s this little thing called gender expression, people.
this actually really does feel nice to hear. thank you
Forgive me but this is so [r/thanksimcured](https://www.reddit.com/r/thanksimcured/). We are girls, we just can't see that clearly sometimes because we're fucked up by too much societal trauma, not to mention testosterone and its demonic-like effects.
I woke up and looked in the mirror this morning and almost started crying, thank you for this, I really needed it today.
Thank you
wow ... thank you! I might need to put this as a motivational message next to my mirror for the mornings, something to lift me up when facing a new day <3
I need reminding of this regularly, especially when the dysphoria hits (kicked my ass last night).
yeeeesh blyat I have a monke chest again! gtg shave UmU
But I don’t look or sound like a girl so that makes me sad
And thank you for making my morning a little brighter stranger
Great post babe. Thank you!! 💗💗💗
My partner who is mtf broke my heart the other night.
She just went off on why she doesnt feel like it's worth it to have surgery, take hormones,  etc. 

For medical reasons she had to stop transitioning a few years back. But the pain she is going through just destroyed me.
yes yes
Thank you so much, as someone who can’t express themselves through clothes and other gender affirming ways it means a lot
I needed this. Tysm!
Thank you! I was feeling really dysphoric so I needed to hear this.
Thanks!  I love these thoughts. 💜 Also, appreciate being called a kid since I'm in 40s.  Double the treat. 😋
thank you for this. i haven’t shaved my face in a while to avoid suspicion from my parents so going to school has been really hard for me dysphoria wise. i’m not out to anyone, but i am to myself and i think that makes it even harder. this really helped <3
Thanks
I love you all and I'm proud of you ✨ be proud of yourself because you're beautiful and valid
Thanks
Thank you so much
Yeah. I think its weird when those online trans quizzes determine your gender based on what toys you played with as a kid.
Thank you! I needed this rn ive been super dysphoric lately
I needed this so much, thank you!
May I add, we have girl bodies, cuz we are girls!
Thank you so much for this
I actually really needed to hear this today. Thank you.
[deleted]
Idk about being loved but I will accept being valid
Thank you so much, sweetheart! 🏳️‍🌈
First thing I see when coming onto Reddit today. Thanks. I needed this post. 🙏❤️
Im still having trouble absorbing the info u just gave me, but i appreciate it! I feel like a girl, yet my physical aspects keep telling me that im still a dood, and that im just a massive fucking mess. My voice is so deep it makes me cringe, yet happy every time I get called a girl by my trans bf. But either way, thank you for taking your time to remind us. I wish you have a good rest of the day!
This was like a warm hug from a loving parent. Thank you so much for this 😢.
Thank You. It is so hard to remember. Thank You for reminding us.
Thank you I really needed this. Feeling like shit lately lmao
Yes you are!
It's nice to not always have to try hard
This made me tear up a little, thank you I love this. And the best part is that this is true, we are girls no matter where we are, what we do, what we wear or who we like
Fantastic,wanna go out on a date?

From the title I thought it was going to be transphobic and I was so ready to write a paragraph to fight a bitch out of solidarity
💕🏳️‍⚧️
Are we girls when we poop? Cis girls don't do that right?
This is awesome!!!!! I love it  ❤️❤️❤️
i don’t think this post was intended for me
Certainly don’t feel like it when I got hairy legs
Not a kid, but I tell myself this everyday when I get home from work and take my wig off.
Hey girlfriend, you are awesome.
Nihilism doesn't have to lead to hate and the meaninglessness of the future isn't inherently depressing. You can find comfort in the fact that nothing objectively matters, only you can assign subjective value to the experiences you have. What you might be experiencing is a clinical condition, depression, which is not caused by nihilism but the other way around. You need to seek help from a professional. 

Life as a trans person is extremely difficult indeed, but that doesn't mean that it's normal to feel hopeless. You'll still suffer once you overcome depression, but you will use your suffering as a means to empower yourself and keep going with greater resolve. It will get better.
While I'm not entirely sure I see how this relates to my post, I think you should see somebody about this.  I understand that you're still young, and that everything going wrong seems huge right now...but I assure you you've only tasted a tiny piece of the world and things do get better.  Saying never at your age is really self-defeating. You're taking away options that you don't even know you have yet.

Please, talk to somebody about this. There are people out there that can help you.
[Check out this video on optimistic nihilism by Kurzgesagt, it aligns pretty close to the philosophy I personally subscribe to, and I can definitely say it's made me a happier person.](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14)
Oh my sweet sister, sending big love your way
Dysphoria is an awful jerk who lies to us.

Patterns of thought and neurons in our brain laid down by trauma, and it’s so hard to resist them - but worth it to use self-affirmation when they tear up to change the patterns of thought and lay down new ones
Hell yeah sister, you too
Being a woman is not a title you earn, it's who you are.  It's your identity.  You are a woman from the very moment you realized you were trans.  Aspire to be more feminine, but know you're a strong, proud, badass woman.
You don’t need to earn your identity. It’s yours just by asserting it.

I totally get wanting to be more feminine, and that’s valid - but it’s not a hurdle you have to jump to be a woman, it’s just something you do to feel better about the woman you are.
awh thanks! ngl i always worry im not like valid or 'trans enough' because im a tomboy , i needed this
There’s no such thing as “fem enough” to be a woman. You are a woman, and that’s that.

You may want to be more fem for your own aesthetic desires, and that’s totally valid - but it’s not a hurdle you have to jump to be a woman, because you already are!

Hopefully you can get away from your transphobic family before long, and live up to the person that you are
Grant you mercy so much f'r this, it’s very much madeth mine own day c:

Oh. Oh shit. Wow, I am so glad you came along!  That's what the problem is, I've been a guy all along!  Damn!
Guess I can take off this dress and go pick up a football and a hammer and start acting like a real man.

God I wish you would have come around like last year!  You would have saved me so much time.

Are you mtf trans?  Yes?  Then it's meant for you.
So are you!!
No you!
No im pretty sure im staying like this for a while, cause it hasnt changed for like, 5 years. And misanthropy, antinatalism, cosmic nihilism, depression, anxiety, gender dysphoria, an obscene amount of hatred, and borderline personality disorder are kinda big things. I doubt help would work cause all it did in the past was either nothing or worsen the issue. At This point if i were to get 'better' i would lose myself, that would be 5 years of me being me just gone. I'm tired sorry i post stuff like this as a vent or smth idk.
I appreciate you trying to gas me up and validate me, and normally external validation means a lot to me, but not this time. I have to feel valid as a woman on my own terms. Not everyone has to believe in gender performativity, but I do for myself, and at this point in my transition I am not performing womanhood.

Just as nobody else has the power or the right to tell me I'm not a woman or that I'm not valid, the inverse is also true. If I don't feel like a woman yet, nobody really has the power to change my mind for me. I have to do that on my own terms.
Again, if that's the way you see it then by all means, do your thing. But for me, that's just not my perspective. I know not everyone agrees, but gender performativity is very real to me and at this point in my transition I'm not truly performing womanhood. I've come out to myself, a very select few people in my life, and more than a few anonymous strangers online, but simply acknowledging that I'm not cis is not enough for me to feel valid as a woman.
No such thing as “not trans enough” ❤️

Identity isn’t something you have to prove or reach criteria for being valid - it just is valid always.

Trans tomboys are awesome and valid! All GNC people, cis and trans, are awesome and valid!
Thank you. I needed to hear that.

Hey bud, I've got the same list as you do and I am working in therapy to get better. I've only been in here a year and my life has improved so much since I found the right therapist. 

I don't want to downplay your pain, turmoil, and the absolute inescapability of it. But you have to believe me that this is only how you are right now. I was in so deep and so estranged - for *years*. I was depressed, hurting myself, wanting to end, everything. Every day I woke up and asked ""why?"" Every day I woke up and thought ""great, here goes another one."" But eventually with some work and new people in my life I started waking up (and I'm not like giddy-happy or anything) but there are now hours on end where I am *genuinely happy and a peace* and it *keeps happening* 

I'm new to this whole ""happy and hopeful"" nonsense, it's weird and I hate it but my god is it addicting. So if my anxious, BPD, former-depressed, former-nihilistic ass can do it - so can you. Sending my love, I promise you can do it too ok?
>an obscene amount of hatred

A lot of that, along with several dump trucks worth of anger, sort of melted away as my T levels dropped.
You are more than your depression, no matter what it tries to tell you.  I obviously can't make you get help, but you really should.  It's your choice though.
You are more than your challenges, more than your difficulties, more than the feelings which plague you.

I lived where you did for 25 years. It was awful, soul-crushing, and miserable. So I empathize with you to a high degree.

You’re not your depression, you’re not your self-hate, you’re not your dysphoria, nor your BPD. Those are things you experience, they’re not you.

There is a world of joy, self fulfillment, and happiness waiting for you. When you reach a point where what you’re experience becomes so intolerable that the options are “change or die” I really hope you can remember this, and choose change - I faced that dilemma about 5 years ago and chose “change” and am now living a life that I always wanted but was so afraid I’d never have.

You’re valuable, valid, your struggles are real, and they are hard, and painful. But they’re not all that there ever can be.
I think I know all those feelings. In my worst puberty years, I used to bring myself into this deep inner darkness pit listening to black metal. Just try to hang in there the best way you can until you feel it's time to get out. I'm open if you want to vent.
yeah ik ur right, i just struggle to beleive it some days, thank you ❤

Do I pass in this outfit ? I normally wear fitted clothes that are meant to help my curves disappear. Are the loose tracksuits bringing out my hips and curves? ( FTM)		"I honestly expected this to be an mtf before pic, you pass really well
you look very young (I don't know how old you are) but you do pass.
I haven't read more of the title than do I pass because I don't want to sway my opinion but to me you look like a 13-15 year old boy. I hope that's the desired answer 😁
Ngnl u look like a quirked up white boy with a little bit of swag burdting it down
Honestly, if you hadn't said anything I'd have thought you were a cis dude. Hips and curves aren't an exclusively femme trait tho, imo
I thought I was a cis guy for 40 years. You pass better than I did in high school
You look like an average 15yo boy so yeah, you pass.
You pass pretty well, lad. You look like a hippy dude lol
I saw your other comment so about 15
you pass for sure my guy, didn't even think it was FTM until I read the title
Bro for a sec i thought a 14 year old boy was posting on another sub, so yes
Nah, bro. You’re fine. I wouldn’t have guessed had you not told me.
Definitely. A school-aged guy.
yea, you pass
You're fine dude, only maybe get a longer undershirt if you're wearing white ( not super noticable though, might not even be a thing in person)
Absolutely :)
You look like one of my (male) friends
Honestly you pass with flying colors! I think you are really handsome!
You pass super well!
Yeah, you pass
Looks masc!
hell yeah my man

you look really handsome and stylish
TF IS THE SECOND PICTURE


YA DEMON??
If I saw you walking out of the men’s restroom or mens locker room, I wouldn’t even think twice about there being anything off about you or that you didn’t belong there. You pass extremely damn well. Like if I didn’t know anything about you I wouldn’t think you were just a dude. Hell even if you walked up to me and said point blank to my face “I’m actually a trans dude” I’d honestly have a hard time believing you because you pass so damn well I’d think you were a cis dude.

Like you’re boxier than me, and I’m a pre-hrt trans girl.
I don't think they're bringing out hips or curves, however the loose T shirt does make you look much younger and scrawnier since it's oversized, and makes your torso look skinner compared to your legs. You might be fine with it and idk how old you are, but for me it's something I try to avoid because I start to feel like i look like a kid in my dad's clothes as opposed to an adult. I personally find if I'm wearing loose pants I need to wear some bigger more structured top or outerwear to balance it, as a big loose T shirt or a too tight T shirt makes my torso look too small compared to my legs and appears a bit more pear shaped, and I prefer to look more rectangular and streamlined. But that's me. And with the hoodie it looks totally fine though because that's a bit thicker and holds its shape a little more, so it balances it out and bulks out your torso to match without it looking too lose by comparison to the pants.

Edit: looks like from other comments ur 15 so tbh don't worry about it then, you just look young because you are young. You pass just fine and as your age. Hips / thighs are less obvious with the hoodie than without, but it's honestly fine with the T-shirt it just reads more lanky teen.
Definitely pass u look 15
YOU LOOK GREAT!!!
Fuck yes
Hell yeh you pass, you look cool as heck dude
You look like this one guy I know at summer camp. And that’s a good thing cause he is a cis male
You look like a young buck to me. I recommend vocal exercises to help give you a deeper voice in general. Yes, you may still have a bit of a fem pitch, but once you begin T it will help you so much. Much love.
as another 15 y/o (except im nonbinary transmasc) im gonna say that your curves are hidden quite well! i definitely think you pass!! im gonna assume you're wearing a binder because your chest is quite flat and looks like how mine does when i wear a binder, and that isn't noticeable to me. to me, the *most* noticeable thing are the thigh curves, but even so NDthat could be chalked up to the way the sweatpants are cut, and it's not noticeable at all.

overall, im gonna give that a 9.5/10. also, what kind of fitted clothes do you wear?? im gonna need to give that a try 👀
You look like a bro to me.
You sure you aren't MtF bro?
I honestly thought you where really early stages of mtf
you look great and absolutely pass. your hips are a little bit brought out, but some guys have big hips. very handsome my guy.
… wait you were not born male?
Bro you look like the bad boy every girl falls over in those teen rom coms. Just keep your pants over your butt! No one wants to see that xD proud of you son <3
My guy wtf. Pass? You're a teenage dude. I saw the pics and thought you were MtF and started to feel bad, and then I read FTM and felt so fucking happy for you!

Go king!
I mean, I never would've guess your gender if i saw you in public 🤷🏻‍♂️
That's pretty much what my 15 y/o brother wears every day
Lmao I thought you were a boy asking about passing as a girl till I read further. You very much pass bro
def pass as 15 year old male
I see them a bit but no more than a cis man would have, wide hips and thighs run in my family.
Looks like you were born a guy hon so yeah you pass with flying colors
You definitely pass, little man.
You pass very well
Bossman you pass incredibly well!! Dont worry about that stuff. You also look cool so yeah!
in the best way possible, you look like tom scott. you pass super well!
Heck yea you do!
You pass dude
Sup bro
I just rode public transport in the school rush hour and every other dude your age looked like you. I would not have looked twice at you, you pass pretty good. I also like that outfit a lot on you!
You're passing incredibly well, looks like me before transitioning back when I was 14 or so.
You look like a dude to me 😎
Yeah man, you pass very well
You pass very well!! Pants that are straight cut (such as jeans or cargo shorts) are really good at cancelling out hips imo, so maybe consider getting a couple pairs of those lol
Why the gray colors though? Is that your thing or trying to blend into wall?

By the way I would address you as bro upon first meeting. You pass.
They hide them well, you pass good! Though, tip for hiding hips, coming from someone who struggled with it myself, hoodies around the waist helps hide those, same with straight cut trousers. I dunno if the latter works 100%, but I hope that helps a bit.
YOU LOOK SO GOOD I wish I could pull this off
You look great and I think you’d definitely pass
You look like a guy in my school, so I'd say you pass.
Lookin’ fly my guy.
You look like a pretty normal dude. I wouldn’t think twice when looking at you.
Looks amazing on you, a definite dude bro type outfit
You look like the guy that the Cool 80s Kid With Two TVs And An NES from the magazine ads grew up to become
Fully passing. Why post this if not to brag? Do you really have doubts?
Man, you pass so much well ! You look like the cisest dude ever. So yes you pass.
Very much so.  I think you got it figured out 👊
yis
You do pass!!!
Looks like a chill dude to me, my man
Nah man. You look like one of the boys in this outfit, keep your head up king
Dude u r guy
Yep! You pass super well!
You look GREATTTTTT
you pass well. i am happy for you. :)
defo pass as a guy. very typical masc outfit too.
Your drip has reached flood status, king
You definitely pass! You look like a younger guy, but you're 15 so that doesn't make passing harder. The fit definitely doesn't bring out your curves at all. You look great man!
You look exactly like me when i was your age and still thought i was a cis guy. You look great
goals
Looks class my guy, fill your pockets with useless stuff of you're worried about your hips looking too wide. If anyone looks weird you can pull out like a toilet roll and they'll assume that's what made your hips look big, but honestly they don't look too big to me
Lookimg good brother
You pass just fine don’t worry 👌🏻
Bro vibes all the way man nice job!
When I first saw it I actually thought it was gonna be an MTF before and after pic so I think you passed with flying colours
you pass super well and i dont think you look like anything but a guy, but from a fashion perspective alone i think slightly less baggy sweatpants pulled up a bit higher on your waist might be the move. low slung baggy pants can have the effect of shortening your legs and making your thighs look bigger, so while it might seem counterintuitive to buy tighter fitting clothes to hide curves, dressing with the right proportions can accentuate the relatively straight up and down figure you already have. otherwise looking great man
you look just like a basic teen aged guy so yeah
i think you pass really well :]
Yes🏳️‍⚧️
You look as though you would pass in any outfit hun. If i didn't know you were trans i wouldn't have guessed that you were
You look masc af! Very good fit!
You look like a cisgendered boy (I’m sorry if this sounds aggressive or derogatory I promise it’s not)
Bro, you look exactly like me before I cracked (curves and all) and I'm MtF. You pass.
I’m gonna say this if I met you IRL I would have no idea you weren’t cis
You look like half the teenage boys I grew up with lmao
You pass hella good bro. The loose clothes give you no curves. You still got the baby face, but you're young so that's to be expected.
You look like every white boy ever. Congrats!
(/lh)
Yeah
Hella passable
Perfect. As a ftm I wear these all the the time, thb I always wear those gray pants and white shoes too
totally 💜
My guy you look amazing
You look like a teenage boy in highschool to me!
i am jealous of those mirrors… yes you pass
You honestly pass really well.
you look like a regular 16yr old guy.
Yeah you pass no doubt. The hoodie looks especially good on you
Yup, looks like a guy to me...
Absolutely
You very much pass!
Yeah dude! I wish I passed as good as you (however I am MTF).
I don't think your body shape really matters in this case because your face 100% looks like a cis boy
I thought you were a cis boy before I read the title, you look great 👍
Boy you absolutely pass
Cis M here - you’re passing 💯%

(Not that anyone’s identity gives them more or less cred on deciding who passes)
Yes sir, that is a man
I thought you were a dude before I even read the caption, so yes, you absolutely do pass
You look great dude!!!
Yes, you pass really well
Bro you pass so good
Um excuse me pass some of that passing to the rest of us. I would recommend pants that have wide legs those make you look more masculine if you're worried about any curves, I wear them all the time and they look really nice.
You just look like you have legs you don’t wanna get kicked by lol
Honestly thought you were a teen boy!
Dude you look like an average white guy you absolutely pass!
You look fine Hun, as long as you're happy that's what matters 🙂
you honestly look like an average cis guy at my school
You just look like any other teen dude
Looking good
You look like you are about to play the most intense guitar I have ever heard at a death metal concert.
as a Brit this is the average man I see on every corner so I wouldn’t give u a second look.
You’re good.
Hell yea you do
teenage boy, can't see it otherwise
You look just like my cousin, who is cis. So I'd say yeah.
Not a fan of the style but u pass
Yes, you look like the typical 8th grade freshman boy.
Before I read the FtM part I was honestly expecting a MtF image so Id say you pass with flying colors
You definitely look like a guy, I'd put you around 13-14 so you pass really well, your curves don't show at all. You're doing great
you pass in the sweat shirt and sweatpants combo, for the white tee you need to find a better binder. if your chest is too big to flatten with binding, try using trans tape in combination with a binder
you look like a very average 15 year old boy lol
You definitely pass!
I've needed to watch what dubreddit i was on
Yes you do
Damn dude! You're looking like a handsome young man!
Ehm, is your name by any chance oliver, you look EXACTLY like a classmate i had In highschool (male, you totally pass dude)
Yes- honestly you look 13/14
Yes! I get super happy whenever I see someone passing, thanks mate
Yeah, man. You pass.
Didn’t realize you were a trans guy until I saw r/trans at the top so I’d say you pass pretty well
If you didn't say FTM I would've assumed you were a guy
You look like a kid that would bully me so I'd say yes
100% bruh. No femme detected
I wouldn't give a second glance, just immediately think ""teenage guy"" and move on. You look like my neighbor's sons who are very sporty and active dudes. Men have hips too! Every body is different with so much shape variation.
I never would have questioned, curve hidden, good job!
You look just like any other teenage boy I've ever met.
My guy just looked up ""average male high schooler"" and posted the pics here
I'm not gonna lie I saw the pic n was wondering what subreddit I was on and why am I seeing a random teenage boy before the title, yes you do
Thought you were amab/a cis guy at first. You def. pass, bro :))
Hell yeah bro!
Don't worry about passing because you look like a boy model to me ! Very handsome and I like the style.
You look like every 15 year old boy I’ve ever known, not sure how old you are but definitely highschool age. Sorry if I’m wrong tho!!
U honestly look like a cis boy/young adult u pass with flying colours
Nice boy
U look good dude, u pass perfectly
My dude, I mean this in the best way possible, you look like a 12 year old boy 

You pass super well!
Yeah dude
You look awesome my guy!! The baggy pants and shirt look intentionally stylish
You look like my cis male cousin if that makes you feel any better :3
Yes you pass amazingly lol. I thought this was a screencap from that British show ""The End of the F\*\*king World""
i mean you look like a dude to me bro 🤷
nah this is a cis dude and you cannot tell me otherwise 


definitely pass
Hoodie
You completely pass
Dude, had to double check what sub I was on. You pass super well!
Nah you look good man i wish i could transition like  yours cuz its really good
you look like every other cis guy I go to highschool with so yeah I'd say you pass! /g
Looking at you, I wouldn’t blink twice
you pass AMAZINGLY. i wish i passed this well
All I see is a dude 💜
My Brother in Christ, you look amazing! Nice outfit, too.
Yeah
Are they *bringing out* your curves? No, I don't think so. I can kinda trek you have wide hips in that first photo, but it's partially just how you were standing, and also, no one will think twice about that lol. Some guys just have junk in the trunk. 

Are you passing? In my eyes, 100% yes. It genuinely took me a sec to process what I was reading; when I first just saw the pic, I thought I was being recommended a random post from r/teenagers or something. You look like half of the dudes that went to my high school lmao. 

Depending on what you sound like and how you carry yourself, I think you'll have very little issue passing in your day-to-day. At worst, maybe you're androgynous in person and some people aren't sure what to assume. But most cis people aren't going to look at you and go ""that's a trans guy"" or (spoiler for potential trigger) ""that's a ||girl dressed like a dude.||"" They're just gonna see someone presenting very masculine and auto-associate maleness unless given reason to assume otherwise. 

At least, that's what it seems like to me. Again, at first I didn't even realize this was a passing post. You look great, man! \^^
I’m AMAB and have fairly pronounced hips, especially when I’m keeping my grubby hands off the sweets lol. No, your hips aren’t too pronounced, but try not to get too hung up if some show. I hope this helps!
Thought this is mtf pre pic, so you do pass pretty well 😅
Yes!!!
 Bro nice clothing, where did you get the swag anyways?

Ok, ngl, I thought you where a boy at first sight, after I look at the full title, you fooled me which is a good thi g!
yes! you pass! you look amazing dude!
Bro passes better than I do at 21 💀❤️ you look awesome mate! If you’re wondering how old you look I’d say anywhere 14-16. Keep killin it dude
Absolutely pass 💕 I wouldnt have guessed otherwise
Check out these dope clothes
Hmm, it's missing something. OH WAIT I'VE GOT IT! The finishing touch👑
yes - and some advice - put your shoulders back and i think you'll pass even better.
You pass i would just assume your cis if i saw you in the hallway of my school tbh I hope that doesn’t sound rude 

Also just saying you look absolutely great :]
The boomer says pass✔️
That is a boy in that picture.
I thought you were a cis male at first, you pass 100% also i love your hair! It looks so soft
You look like someone I would’ve feared in high school. But yes you do pass as a 14-15 year old boy. Your face shape is honestly rather masc
BY THE WAY GUYS I AM PRE T!!
Looking good
You look great dude! You pass essily!
Looking good dude
You do pass, just look very young
You totally pass dude. You're also hot af:)
This works really well
Woah, I think you pass really well!
yes
I think you definitely pass, was kind of wondering why you were in doubt? But I totally understand that nagging feeling. But you look awesome and I love street wear and athleisure. I also think you might enjoy the effects of some color blocking. Some sort of chest color blocking or horizontal stripes on top can give the appearance of broader shoulders, and it's a pretty common design trend in men's fashion, so easy to find. This will help enforce the upsidedown triangle silhouette that is typically viewed as male, broadening the top to deemphasize the hips. Like I was just thinking about the same outfit, just with the top 1/3 of the tshirt or hoodie in black or other color.
You look like a guy blessed with a semi big butt in the good way. Just enough butt to be hot. Not so much that it gives you away. The perfect amount of butt.
Bro no way you haven’t lived your entire life as a guy. You pass suuuuuuuuper well. Good job!
definitely!
You look like you’re around fourteen to sixteen. You’re very handsome!
You look like generic 17-18 year old guy. So yeah good job.
The mirror ones made you look Four-armed lmao. You totally pass. I’m cis male but wish I was as handsome as you :D
You just look like a boy. Definitely not bringing out your hips.

In picture 2, though, you look like you have two extra small arms, and that’s very funny to me.
you look like a typical teen guy, absolutely passing! Are you on T?
Bro that's what my hips look like and I'm cis, you're fine man
[deleted]
Honestly your facial features remind me of Joey Batey, so yeah I'd say you pass.
Aye thank you so much ! How old would you say I looked ?
Honestly same. I saw ftm and I was like whoa
I kinda want to know your thought process behind this comment. I'm just curious as to why you're comparing them to an mtf pre everything?
I’m 15, thank you 🙏
I’m 15 so that’s good enough to me:) thank you
White boy with swag , I fuck with that
Yeah I know it’s just something I get super fixated on , and I guess dysphoric . Iv always had a very curvy figure so my brain constantly tells me I can’t wear T-shirt’s without hoodies
OP *is* a dude. Did you mean cis dude?
😂 much love mate , appreciate it
I’m so happy you said that gonna be honest 😂
:)good to know
VECNA GOT ME FAM ALLOW IT
Nah but fr it was just to see different positions and seeing if I still pass in different poses 😂
Also you hella pass
Haha that’s really good I’m glad I’m passing , I’m pre T so all of these comments really help:)
Thank you for the advice , so smaller T-shirt . Only issue is I have extremely defined hips so going any smaller would make it very very hard to hide . I’m 15 so I’m not sure if the oversized stuff sort of “ fits “ my age ? But it’s definitely helpful thank you . Are you saying I pass better with the hoodie on top ? Bc that’s extremely helpful if so
I have a lot of voice shit on my page , do you think I don’t pass on it ? The one with the fem on the vid is a before and after
Mostly wear shit like cargos but not the jaw string ones . Been into specific tees but they have a certain cut/ texture that makes your hips basically disappear . I’ll try get a few photos up at some point
Nah nah 💀 I got big ol tits
Nope , pre T
Cheers
Yo
Thank you that means a lot 🙏
I have superrrr good cargos that help me 100% just wanted to try a different genre of clothing and seeing it suits me that’s all
Nah I’m not tryna match the wall 😂 Iv always wore black to cover and hips or shit so I thought trying I lighter colour and overcoming my fear would be beneficial
Thank you 🙏 appreciate it
😎 hell yeah
Well I’m pre T so trying on new outfits and seeing if light colours pass on me works. This isn’t a brag post I’m genuinely insecure about my hips and dips. Very sorry if it came across that way
Yes I am guy
🙏🤝💪 appreciate that
🤝
Good idea 😂 cheers
🤝
I play guitar so imma class this as a win 🤝
The look I was going for , where abouts in Britain ?
Definitely not my usual attire but thank you I appreciate it
How old are people in that 8th grade
Iv wanted trans tape for 2 years now . I just can’t afford it unfortunately. I would kill for it honestly 😭
It was extremely close to being Olivier , but nah my names noah
Appreciate it 🤝
Don’t give up hope , I’m still PRE T so people just grow differently
Guess I was born with the swag 💀 this is an outfit I don’t try with , just casual wear so I was super suprised to see all of the compliments
The two mirrors are slightly apart and on different angles ... ect. Forgot about that 💀
Nope pre T
Yeah nah I don’t hold my bag at all when I’m walking , it was just for the photo . But thanks !
14-16 ish. 16 is a push
based on the subreddit it was presumably one or the other.
I read them as an amab
They're saying that op looks like he's AMAB and since cis guys don't typically post pictures of themselves to trans subs that only leaves one option. It was a compliment
I don’t think it was them giving off ftm vibes so much as that generally people don’t post pictures of random cis dudes on this sub so they assumed it’d be like “this is how I looked before I realized I was trans” or something because they couldn’t think of anything else it’d be
then you just look appropriately aged.
pass very well
i was gonna say 15 without having looked at responses
But are you goated with the sauce?
That's absolutely fair. And a good thing to be aware of because your brain will highlight those features no matter what because they know they're there even if you had the absolute best stealth apparel and no one could tell you had any hips at all. Bodies and brains can be weird 🙃
you absolutely pass!!! I wouldn’t have thought otherwise. if it helps, i’m mtf and i’ve always had a small waist and big hips in comparison to others… so don’t let dysphoria trick ya
Yes! Thank you for that correction. I'm sorry. I responded right after waking up. OP is definitely a dudely dude
XDDD. I mean I assumed that was your intention. To look like a hippy LMAO
Yeah it's kinda tricky with the shirt. Because you don't want it to clearly look smaller (and you definitely don't want it to be tight fitting), but you don't want to be obviously too small for the shirt either. With the context with that you're 15 though I think the loose shirt is much less of an issue, it does fit your age more as you said. Oversized clothes is something I'm more careful about as an adult who can accidentally look like a teen if I wear loose clothes, but like when you're actually a teen that's just fine and can be an intentional style thing. So I think it's probably fine as is. I think you look and pass a bit better with the hoodie to square out the proportions between the upper and lower half of your body, but either could work, and like it's summer so don't melt lol.
Honestly I don't think the loose shirt is an issue. You look your age plus oversized clothing is kinda fashionable now anyway.
I didn’t go directly to your page. I’ll check it out.
I just looked and honestly you sound great to be pre-T. I noticed a few inconsistencies where sometimes your vocal chords sound a little strained, but other than that it’s pretty fantastic!
ooo alrighty, ill keep that in mind, thanks!
I wish I did
Well you look very good and you definitely pass lol ^^
Take it from a guy who had a rather severe case of gynecomastia (firm and full C-cups) as a teen. Pull your shoulders back and stand up straight. I know you're worried about your boobs poking out but there are products out there that do a great job of flattening and shaping your chest so they look more like pecks. I have no idea what kind of look you're going for but posture is a big indicator of confidence. Puff your chest out, stand up straight, and check yourself in the mirror till you're happy with the shape your chest is. Then carry it proudly all day.

You got this man! 👊
Literally, I cannot stress this enough. Put the most random shit in your pockets that *might* be considered useful like once in a blue moon or whatever. Total bro move, I still do it sometimes. I did get weird looks when people asked for like an apple or a cheese grater and I could just pull one out there and then
I’m in london so every cishet guy Ik wants to dress like this, or they skate board. As another trans dude the roadman look wins everytime somehow😭

check your dms :)
Neat

I’m 15 so I’m happy with that 😎
Busting it down sexual style 🤣 /j
Can’t agree more , thank you 🙏 it does mean a lot as well as all of these super kind comments
I’m not sure if Your in the US or not , but here tracksuits and clothes like the ones I’m wearing are basic clothing . Anything different to this will be classed as weird 😂 but I’m glad I’m passing as a hippie 😎
Oversized clothing has 100% been my fashion sense , big into 90s style and that so that means a lot . Just don’t wanna push my luck I guess
Thanks man I appreciate it
Valid though I must say , for sure gonna do that
Yeah yeah I get you, I’m in manny so I get you 🤝
That’s good enough thank you
Yes, very convincing presentation of your gender.  If it were a ""trick"", he'd say ""just kidding"", but I think he is for real.
Yeah you look good! Keep up the work hun. and never let anyone else decide your fate, that's for you to decide.
Looks about right. I was prepared to say 15 but was like “nah trans guys look like that at 25”
I thought 15 or 16 🥰
You honestly look exactly like a cis guy I knew in high school. You pass so well and you look super handsome :) the fits are great too and really pulls it all together

I’m super proud of you! You look great, I wish I knew I was trans when I was your age. I can tell you’ve got a long amazing life ahead of you and you are already become the great great young man you’ve always been inside. And if you haven’t tried suits before I highly recommend that! You can thrift one pretty easily (suit jacket, white collared shirt, black pants, a tie are all super easy to find at a thrift shop) all my trans masc friends absolutely loves suits, they be lookin hella dapper and I can tell you will to :)

Much love, it makes me so happy to see a young trans person thriving <3
hahaha, Im actually in a Southeast Asian country lol, we normally wear clothes suited for hot weather haha
Yeah I don't think you have anything to worry about man. I think you would pass no matter what clothes you wear tbh, but I get it. I haven't been misgendered in public in over a year and I still feel like tiny little things out me when I look in the mirror.
Thank you 🙏
I fucking HATE it! Youthfulness can be nice, but I would love to not be treated like I'm in my early-to-mid 20s at 34. 

But that's what I was thinking is he passes as long as it's ok that he definitely looks like a teenager 🤣🤣🤣 so I'm glad he actually is one!
Thank you so much ! Much love to you stranger , back when I first came out I wore my own sort of suit all the time . It was a traditional one but I sure looked good in it 😂
I got pulled over for speeding once. The cop says, in the most baffled voice, “you know you have to be at least 15 years old with a valid license to drive right?”. I’m 17, but upon showing him he was so embarrassed that he just… left.
It's been 5 minutes and I'm still laughing uncontrollably. Thanks so much for making my night.
""Oh well, keep speeding then I guess""
Nah he just said to slow down a bit"	wqn4dj	trans	2424	0.95	2022-08-17 11:59:18

you won't believe what I just found in the back of this Pikachu toy from when I was a teenager	"I was never allowed to have stuffed animals when I was younger my parents had concerns about me having feminine things because I showed signs of this transgender stuff ever since I was a child the one stuffed animal I was kind of allowed to have was this stuffed I choose you talking Pikachu I got when I was young my dad used to like to torture me with it would throw it hit it with a hammer and he cut out the voice box so it couldn't talk anymore I was actually on discord talking to some of my friends about how the stuffed animal I got from my last boyfriend was the first stuffed animal I've ever had and I pulled out my little Pikachu toy to show them to damage it had from my dad using the torture it

 when I opened up the little battery pack in the back and I saw this in there just like oh my God this is a pill pack dated to 2008 right before I tried coming out to my parents for the first time it's some birth control I got desperate and stole for my sister I was hiding in the back of the Pikachu just be holding this in my hand again it's mind blowing it wasn't long after this that I tried coming out to my mom about wanting to be a girl and everything going to hell from them forcing me to cut my hair and just starting to check if I had girl clothes and everything that just made my life a living hell back then I had long hair and I was 130 lb or so they forced me to cut my hair and I got so depressed my life just kept getting worse and worse I ended up over 300 lb this little pill pack is from right before all of it started it's literally the start of my legacy of trying to come out trying to be the girl I am and all the crap that happened literally holding in my hand now again after all these years is literally haunting I cannot believe it like this is crazy and I just really wanted to show you guys like can you even believe this this has been in this Pikachu since oh my God I was a teenager at least I graduated high school in 2009 so it's been quite a while"	"Sorry for the wall of text I'm freaking out
Seriously hope you you were able to get out of there :(( I feel for you
My god, what an awful story, I am so sorry.  It’s downright traumatic.  So many people just can’t admit that being trans isn’t a choice or something we can just not be.  It’s awful.
I could be wrong, but isn't hurting someone's comfort item to make them upset a form of abuse?

It would definitely be abuse if instead of a stuffed animal the OP's dad was hurting a pet.

:(
Shout out to Pikachu for guarding your treasure!
I am 47 and still adore stuffed animals. Sorry that holds so much painful history for you. I hope finding it and the pill pack can in some way help you heal and make you even stronger and beautiful. ❤️‍🩹
I have that exact Pikachu. gotta change his batteries one of these days
Ah parents destroying everything you love... I wish I could not relate. Hope for us both we never have to deal with them again!
Yeah, parents are shit, which is why I swore never to be one.
Oh god my sister went to the health department and they gave her a huge bag of bc pills... I was popping them like candy
Omg feels
I'm sorry you faced such horrible abuse from your family, I hope things are OK now though.
A comma or two wouldn't hurt anyone. The text is somewhat difficult to read...
Wait hol on that was actually there this isn’t a joke ?
Is the period key on your keyboard broken or something
post this to r/egg_irl
I too did this back then ... heh.
Reminds me of when my father threw out the stuffed animal I literally had since my birth.  
He preferred slow psychological torture but was glad to yell at and hit me.
Is the pikachu alright?
Wtf since when stuffed toys are for girls only? That's terrible, sorry it happened to u sis
This story made me cry. I'm so sorry that you had to deal with all of that. And yes plushies are a sacred thing too.
I relate to you. I’m sorry, I wish there was an another way.. ;(
I can forgive murder (/s) but I draw the line at harming someones plushie in ANY way. To me a plushie should always be treated with utmost care because it means the world to someone.
I don't believe you 😜
That's exactly what's happening with my dad.
This actually triggers a memory of my mother screaming at me to STFU, grabbing my stuffed bunny, holding him out of the moving car window and if I didn’t shut it he’d get tossed. 🥲 

My stuffed animals were and still are my life line! I couldn’t live with out them!
Have you tried.  VIOLENCE?


But no in all honesty those people jus don't deserve the right to be called mom or dad..
Don't be sorry. I'm glad that you shared. I'm sorry this happened to you and I hope that things are better with your family now.
I got away from my parents but I'm not entirely out of the woods yet but I'm at least living as the woman I am
Things are a lot better now I actually wish I could jump back in time to myself right at this point like it's crazy that it's this point right before everything happened and just tell myself everything's going to be okay stand before myself as a woman I am now think it would have made the last few years a little easier
Oh my dad was really great at psychological abuse I used to be pretty creative and technically I still am but when I was a little kid I used to write my own comic books and it made me so proud I tried showing my dad and he tore them up or set them on fire if he didn't do that he would sit there and make fun of me cuz I couldn't spell well at the time and just laughed at me 

But my dad was an actual abuser like you guys don't know how bad this monster was when we were kids when he didn't want to deal with us he would reverse the locks on our doors and lock us in our rooms he did this so often we actually broke a hole through the two walls because me and my sisters rooms well right next to each other and we used a hole in a wall to talk to each other

I heard constant slurs my father was a racist a sexist I mean you guys just don't know he abused me and he abused my own mother when I was literally less than 8 years old I was already hearing words like Fa__ot and Ret__d he told me I was gay if I like certain things it just sigh I'm glad I'm away from him but these are just the kind of people I wish this world didn't have
When I was a kid this little Pikachu was my Best friend she was the only stuffed animal I could ever have I couldn't sleep without her sadly she was the direct target of my dad's abuse alot but I used to feel she protected me in my dreams when I got older and I threw all my toys away or got rid of them I couldn't bring myself to get rid of this little Pikachu it was always there for me
It's such a crazy time capsule let's just say it shocked the hell out of me to see it and I started in my 30s get my hands on stuffed animals my first was given to me by my boyfriend at the time and it holds such a special place in my heart I mean I went from being not allowed to have stuffed animals to having a cute little teddy bear given to me by a boyfriend 💜 just shows me those people could never hold me back anymore
I did as well, but I seem to have lost mine 😔
For me it's a polar opposite I want to be a mother one day I'm going to do anything I can to one day I have a normal life to have a husband to hear the word mom everyday it will be the ultimate defeat of everything my parents tried force on me and I will do everything in my power to make sure I am a better parent that either my parents could ever be my child would never hear curse words aimed at them or words like fa__ot or ret__d things I heard coming from my father from a very young age I'll make sure they have good childhoods can have stuffed animals if they want they can play with the toys they want and if my daughter decides she wants to be a boy we can burn his girl clothes together if my son wants to bring home a boyfriend I would welcome them both in open arms nothing's going to stop me from being a parent and definitely be the parent I never had
that doesnt actually work, does it?
Yeah I was a little shocked and I had to start telling everyone lol like what are the freaking odds this has survived
I'm on my phone using voice to text software was kind of freaking out
is your sympathy key broken?
That seems to be all memes
About the same I don't understand why people can be like this it's proof more than anything that we need to rise up be the next generation of parents and teach equality
I would like to say yes but it was the direct Target of my dad's hatred a lot of time if he couldn't hit me which my mom eventually tried to stop he turned to psychological damage he would grab my Pikachu play football with it toss it out into the yard he's taking a hammer to it he cut out the battery pack this Pikachu doesn't even look normal anymore all the little mechanical parts in the face have been crushed the ears won't stay up and honestly I really can't care less I'm never getting rid of this Pikachu she helped me through a lot
I couldn't tie a jacket around my waist I had to carry it any stuffed toys are for girls only to my parents
I am very emotionally attached to my plushies and that made me sad, how can someone threaten to throw away a childs plushie?
Abusive parents are so funny aren't they
I used to get so sad when my parents threatened to throw away my brother's toys. I felt so bad for them and I couldn't imagine what that felt like.
I'mma be real, I thought this was a normal thing, my mom did this to both me and my sibling
Well at least there's that much! Best of luck to you going forward
I totally understand that.  I think that’s something many of us wish we could do.
I wish you luck
Birth control is estrogen most of the time in fact I decided to Google that little pill pack above and it's actually estrogen and progesterone mixed together so yeah these things would work
You have nothing to apologize for. Resurfacing trauma affects everyone differently. I’m just glad that you are still here, that you can finally blossom into your true self and hopefully heal.
My mother was not the nicest to me. I love her but she did a lot of things to me.
Stuffins are sacred. Your best friend, your constant confidant. Always there when you’re sad. Never judges you. Always willing to just be held till the pain recedes, and they never ask a thing in return.
Traumatic childhoods, am I right? We laugh and laugh... 

I have kids now and I can't imagine treating them like that. :( i literally don't understand how someone could do that.
Y-yeah…😓
Tomorrow I will be on hormones for 9 months I mean my family kicked me out in December last year and while I'm probably going to be homeless again in a few days and that's another concern there's nothing going to ever stop me again so much damage to my life has gotten reversed I've literally lost 94 pounds in the past 8 months so much of my life is getting better I'm just going to truck on I don't care I'm never turning back
i know what im spending half my paychecks on for the next few months! /hj

but seriously, would they be as effective as actual HRT? or are they weaker?
.....What you're describing is beyond not being nice. That's abuse. I'm really sorry she did that to you. That's not even remotely ok. That's not what parents are supposed to be like.
thats terrible that anyone would do that period and its fucking scary abt what they think abt other people then bc biologically they are supposed to have strong feeling about protecting them no matter their gender so if they cant treat them well who else is getting hurt??
Tbh I don’t think it helps that media always portrays the perfect family with perfect kids. Some parents are probably blaming their children for not being “perfect”.
I’m sorry I hope you stay safe! Would you be able to live with your Bf?
I just passed 10 months a few days ago. Still stuck with my shitty parents till I can find another job to afford rent at my friends' place. They haven't gone so far as forced me to shave my head but I'm almost constantly harassed ab it and last night my sry excuse for a mother threatened to do it in my sleep which ofc didn't help cuz I've been having nightmares ab that exact scenario. About to say fuck it and leave I have a little saved up and have a few rent free months when I move
Oh yeah sry for ranting here... I rly do hope things can get better for you <3
Well I can't really say it's probably going to definitely be weaker it looks like the one above is a bit of a micro dose
Honestly? I think for quite a few of us, that's what parents ARE. My father abandoned me (twice!) and my mother was abusive to the degree that when finally exploring it with a therapist I was diagnosed with ptsd. I very much doubt my experience is all that extreme among trans people. Our parents are usually cis, after all.
Yeah but as a kid it’s just all I knew. That’s honestly only the least of it, never mind the verbal or physical abuse. As much as I wish I knew I trans as a kid, I’m glad I didn’t. I don’t think I could’ve taken any more.

24 years of misery. Glad I finally got out of that hell hole when I did.

Moving out nearly ruined me but it was definitely worth it.
I wish he lived with his mother still and share the bedroom with his brother in fact we were kind of hoping we could get our own place together so he can get out of that cluster
damn, so not a viable alternative lol

i dont mean to be derailing your post, sorry, this is just a curious subject, esp with the future of the country
>Yeah but as a kid it’s just all I knew

You couldn't have known. I just don't want you to ever doubt that what she did was ok. What she did was most definitely not ok. That's not how it's supposed to be.
Yeah I don't know it's 1 mg/10mcg so it would be pretty weak but I did think it was kind of funny that the first time I ever tried to take female hormones I actually took estrogen and progesterone which I am daily taking progesterone and weekly injecting estrogen now
injections?? ma’am, you are so brave holy moly
It's not bioidentical like what we take now... Usually ethylestrodial and medroxyprogesterone
It's my weekly injection of pure concentrated girl 💜

It's just my preference I don't have a needle phobia and these needles are so little they don't even hurt like seriously I can pinch my arm and it hurts worse
im hoping to move out to a city with Planned Parenthood because ive heard its easier to get hrt from them
I'm in Georgia and I use plume currently it's a paid program $99 a month but it's ran by transgender doctors there's no gate blocking everything's online everything's over video there's no therapist there's no crazy stuff it's just trans doctors helping trans girls and guys I think it's really worth it depending on where you are and they can send the medication just to any freaking pharmacy that you tell them to I get mine sent to Amazon pharmacy and it gets delivered directly to my front door
thats so cool :O

im gonna save this comment and hope it doesnt get taken down in the future lol

edit: whoops, turns out i already have plume saved on my phone lol, do you know if they also do anything to ensure its safe? (ie, not causing ODs or under-using?)
Your blood work is included in the price and you get your basic blood work done just like getting your medications from anywhere else you just have to have the responsibility to take them by what they tell you

I got dragged out of the house to a mall to walk around in a dress	"Friend of mine decided to get me to go to the mall and she happened to make me bring a dress along to change into because my parents don't approve of me being trans. For some reason the bathrooms were full for a while so it took us a bit to get around to me changing.
Was a good day, we went to a sports bar and the server called me a lady, got catcalled by some random dudes, tried a Sangrea for the first time. Eventually she dragged me over to her place to give me some clothes she wasn't using... I didn't think I'd be able to do any of this for a while

Edit: someone commented about doing this around POC, I just want to tell you that I'm Indian, brown skinned and I live in trinidad and tobago not the US, please look at my previous posts and you'll see a pic of me... People aren't as bad as you think"	"Sounds like a really great friend! I’m glad she is there to help you when your parents aren’t supportive. I’m sorry about your family… sending much love and support your way! ❤️❤️❤️
I wish I had friends like this🥺🌹🌹
Sounds like a great day. 👍🏻
When my 17 y/o trans daughter wanted to go shopping, we made it a girls day, so it was her, me and my mom. 
It was so great seeing her try on different dresses and tops, my mom ended up paying for all of her new clothes.
I can’t imagine otherwise. She is still the same kid, I love her just the same. The only difference is that instead of 2 sons I now have a daughter and a son.
My family has sent me some messages or conveyed them through my parents and every single one of them was positive and full of support.
I just wanted to share a happy story.
It’s great having friends like that. I hope everything works out for yourself and you can fully live true to yourself. I had some friends that helped me pick out a dress to wear to a dance awhile ago. My parents didn’t approve but I still snuck it in to wear at the dance (was the most fun I’ve ever had at one). Parents eventually threw it out behind my back sadly
Omg im so jelly girl

Sounds like uve got a great friend :)))
Great friend
What a wonderful day. It feels great to get out and be yourself, doesn’t it??
Sounds like a great day! To avoid waiting try family restrooms at LGBT friendly stores. By the time you do your makeup it will be different customers.
That is so sweet of her, i remember first time i wore skirts in public, i was so anxious but people didn’t even recognise I was trans! And i got catcalled that day but somehow i could handle all of it and also made my day not that I wanted attention but just the fact that they saw me as woman.
All i want to say is Risk it!!!! Don’t hide yourself because at the end of the day nobody’s thoughts matter what they think about you. Live your life and walk with head up !💕
She sounds like an amazing friend! A great ally too! So glad you had some gender-confirming moments too!

Not to mention, it sounded like you were killing it in that dress!
Hold on to her. People like this are of great help.
As a butch possibly ftm that title gave me a fucking heart attack I assumed the worst lmao. Glad you have supportive friends sounds like you had a fun day
I thought this was gonna be a ftm horror story but this turned out to be an amazing mtf story! 

That’s one amazing friend!
Aww, I’m so happy you got to have the mall girl experience!! 💖💖💖
Sounds amazing .
Having a friend like that, who will push you out of your comfort zone to be more accepting of yourself, is one of the BEST things to have. You know she’s a real one.

I’m so happy for you!
Need someone liek her
Not the kind of post I expected after reading the title, but I'm glad it was a good experience!
this made my heart so warm, i’m so happy you have a friend who’s so supportive and generous :)
Reddit you bustard, I wanted to read that comment about the Sangrea!!
I am half Guyanese, and the half is Scottish blood so both sides seem to be super bull-headed and ignorant. Sorry to hear you're going through difficulties with family acceptance! Its fortunate you have that friend who accept and encourage you!👍🏼💕
Awwww.  Much love sister 🥰
Is the perfect time be happy and enjoy your day ❤️❤️
that’s amazing!!
You have an amazing friend
The catcalling and transphobic parents parts suck, but other than that it sounds like amazing girls night out!!

I wish i could do that stuff again. Used to as a teenager with my ex, they helped me discover that I'm not cis... Hopefully the day comes.
Oh, how cool, I did this same thing for trans friend I met recently as well. Its nice to see that gestures like that really do go a long way.
Going out for the first time as your true self in a dress feels incredible! It’s a little scary but then you realize most people don’t care and you just work it!
❤️
Now this is epic
Sounds like an amazing friend, hope you had fun
Super Jealous!
you have a great friend.
I’m so happy for u! Your friend sounds great!
Super happy for you. Glad you had a good day 😄
Sounds like such an amazing time, with such a great friend.  Absolutely loved hearing about your day. So hope you can do this again soon.
OMFG! 
I read the title and I was like 'uuuggghhh' family trying to make you accept your assigned gender by making you feel embarrassed in public.
But this post warmed my heart, so happy for you girl <3
Big love 2 your sister 2 :3
The only situation where cat calling is ok 😂
Glad you had fun. I wish I had a friend to help with stuff like that.
I read the edit.... wait..... someone tried to imply this post was racially insensitive?

Because your post has less to do with race than any sentence ever spoken.... 


That’s like making spoons a race thing. 

Makes literally no sense 😂 

Cute story, glad you had a good day 🙂
[removed]
Thanks, my parents are that weird ""you can be gay bit you can't be trans"" kind of people.... I don't know how to get them to accept things
I'm sure you'll find some, just keep looking because you're never alone. Try some sites and apps made for LGBT meetups like Lex or HER. I met this friend on Lex
Ya, there are people who support others, glad y'all are supportive
Fortunately for me no one touches my clothes here except for one pair of short shorts that went missing and no one knows where it went
I hope I can keep her, even invited me over to hang out with her GF and like, I really want to go and cook some food, do nails, and all the other stuff I missed out on because I had to be a guy in school
Ya it does, I felt nervous the entire time cos of not being confident
There aren't those around here, I kinda just have to move around stealthily and hope no one notices
I love the attention but damn does it also make me want to sink into a shell and never be perceived again
I wouldn't say killing it, I just try my best to look cute
I will, she made an invite to hang out with her and her GF some day in the future when we're all free, just to figure out when that'll be
You're the second person to assume the worse, it's kinda fun
Hope you had a laugh once you figured it out and I hope you get to have some fun days too
Dammit you're the 3rd to think that, I intended it to be clickbait but not that kind. I say dragged because I'm lazy and yes, she's great, I really want to do more with her like getting a pair of stilettos and almost breaking my ankles
Was great... also scary
Really was
It's not like a comfort zone issue, I just don't do things ok my own cuz I never know what to do. Having anyone there with me is more of an excuse to get it done... tho so far she's the only one who wants me to go out as me
My clickbait title worked!! First time I did a click bait one
Ya, she hates dresses and the ones she gave me won't fit her, we exact opposite in fashion XD
Neither of us got this easy, I believe in you too, do what you can to live life happy
The catcalling was a good part for me, I'm one of those that enjoy it tho my line is as long as its harmless. Wasn't really a night out, we spent the day from like 10 to 7
It really does, having someone to be with often relaxes the fear you feel because you can rely on the other person
I'm just that somebody who sees this that they're trying to go out we'll get the courage off of reading and all the others on here
Idk, we ain't playing games XD
I has lots, finally got to gave a girls trip with someone and got to wear my dress outside, got catcalled and all that... next on my list of things i want to do would be to go get my hair and nails done and go to a party with some girl friends
I need to get some cash before tho just so I ain't being a moocher. Hope you can share some fun experiences on here too at some point, I'm sure everyone will live to hear about it
Dammit you're the 4th person sho thought that so far, I wanted clickbait but not that kind
I do hope everyone can find one friend like that, it's nice to have help
Ya, I didn't want to have to put it in an edit but reddit removed the comment and I really want to reply to people like that and talk to them, get some perspective from them and see why they think like that
Yeah I'm confused on how someone took it that way too? Like it doesn't have any mentions of it, it's just a story of a trip to the mall
About? Ask questions my dude/dudette
That is such a weird stance to have… I’m sorry they are like that. Just keep being you, don’t let anyone try to stop you from being who you are
Oh I recognise this, my parents think gay/trans is okay but non-binary for example is not possible? 
I'm still figuring out myself where I fit in in all this so when that came up in passing convo it felt really uncomfortable...luckily no one noticed it
That’s how my mom is too
Play with them and say gay men dress like girls lol
Hopefully enough time will allow them to come around. I have a friend who’s mom rejected her entirely after coming out and after a couple years they’re talking again. Parents will always think they know what’s better but if you’re actively transitioning (even just socially) and you seem happier to them - they should jump on board with your happiness over their misconceptions. Food for thought, stay strong love. I bet the dress looked killer
My grandfather has that weird stance too. How can you approve of one thing but not the other?
Nearly no one used LEX in Poland

I wish more people would since it looks like a cool idea for app, way more different from other apps
They never messed with my clothes before. My parents are kind of similar in that they’re okay with me being pansexual but I cannot even think about being trans or non binary
Omg mood 


i feel u boo
Don’t worry, that gets better with time. Experiences like that can also help build your confidence.

I used to have the same difficulty at the start.
No Target stores with Stabucks? The inhumanity l!
Girl, i get so anxious when especially men approach me even though i know i can pull the cis persona 🙊 and they wouldn’t know but yet it just makes me anxious 🧍🏻‍♀️
And from the sounds of it, you were very successful ;)
My friend(s) were the best support. I'm an introvert so she helped me slowly reach out of my shell. She stopped with, helped me work on makeup, and quite literally everything about everything it feels. Don't hesitate to reach out to her because I believe she will help you a lot, like the help I had.
I did get a laugh and my days have been good and sometimes bland.
Hehe! I wish I had a friend like that get me a binder OR some amazing suits since I suspect my parents are transphobic
you’re siphoning her femininity! /j
Thank you so much ! 🥰
That would be fun, hope you do that soon.
That's understandable.  I would be happy to chat. My little world gets pretty crazy.
I really wanted to know why they thought like that but reddit deleted their comment so I never got to talk to them T.T
I'm the kind of person who won't meet comments like that with hate unless the person is being malicious, perhaps they've had bad experiences
Always, I spent my entire life pleasing others, now it's about me and what I want
just glad we have a generation coming up that isn't going to be like that. Be the change you want in the world and all that
I'm leaving it as is, I'd don't have the effort to waste on them and they always disregard anything I have to say anyway, I'll get a job and move out eventually
I'd love to think like that but my parents aren't the type to stop, honestly I'd probably keep contact to help with stuff I know is happening that'll be a problem for them later and then cut contact. Even if I'm mad at them they're still my parents but there's only so much I'm willing to deal with and that was crossed when my mother decided to publicise that I'm an atheist specifically to get everyone to make problems for me
Perhaps it's seen as them having to compromise on one thing and then they refuse to give anymore ground or something like that
Wish there was a grinder for lesbians, that's an app someone needs to make
Parents are weird, I really don't know what goes through their mind most of the time to be against their kid trying things
Ya I know, that's why I agreed to do it, I want to be more comfortable with me
It has a Starbucks but I've never gone in and it was across a highway from the mall
For better or for worse, I have the same anxiety for everyone regardless of outward appearance
Me being nervous probably helped because I kept doing the grippy thing on the bottom of my dress
She already gave me some new clothes, a kinda cute but professional looking romper being both of our fans cuz it fits perfect and the way it's designed kinda let's the bra peak out if I don't fasten the top but can cover it if I do fasten the top
She also said she has shoes in my size so at some point I'll get those
When I decided to post stuff it was just whatever I was excited about like when I got my bra I got a good pic and posted it, then this one. Just share whatever gets you excited and people will love it
I know mine are but because I wash my own clothes they don't say anything about the clothes I buy... there are other issues but some things go well
She has plenty XD
That’s the spirit! Be yourself! Don’t let other people conform you to their narrow thinking! 😘💕
Yeah thats the energy lets go you can do it sending vibes and suports all the way
Very true! Better times are coming 🙏🏻
Ive been thinking about that for a while. With so many of our generation being openminded and so many coming out the future should get better. Theres also still a lot who are brainwashed by their families and the past generations bigotry and hatred though so its a shame.
So...

they said that about us millennials as well, and unfortunately we produced Lauren Boebert and Tomi Lahren. I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's definitely not a given. We'll have to work for it, and make sure of it.
I get it. I’m rooting for you tho!!! I get the feeling, my parents never listen to me about anything (especially my own feelings lmao). Good to not waste your energy with that tho
Oh geez… I’m sorry. That’s just ridiculous and unusually cruel
Nope. Not with him. He doesn’t even use the Bible as an excuse like almost everyone else. Instead he says “it’s hypocrisy.”
We got this💕💕😩
Sounds even more adorable! Aww
I'm jealous that you had someone for shoes. I had to shop for mine 😩 lol
I just hope everyone learns to be open to opposing views too and taboo topics. I still seem too much complaining and people trying to shout over eachother. Make more understanding even with your ""enemy"" because either of us can be misguided in how we do things
Well ya, hence the part where I said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" 

It'll always take effort but the point is that as a whole the world is moving towards being more accepting
Hope you get through your stuff too
You get use to it over time, I'll have lots of habits to break once I'm on my own but at the very least I can identify the behaviours I have and why they exist
My parents use the excuse of ""people will judge you and you'll be in danger"" as if they don't already judge my weird ass
Don't worry, if we ever meet eachother we cam be awkward together XD
I bought one pair of pumps on sale, I'm so glad I don't gotta spend on shoes cuz them things are expensive... buying a new wardrobe is also going to be expensive
Good outlook on things, best wishes <3
I can imagine lool would be epic💀

Happy to announce my wardrobe is almost 100% girl's clothes!!		"Technically it is 100% girl's clothes because you own them. 😁
Yep, as soon as I came out my clothes were all girl clothes, mind you, I threw out all my guy clothes as soon as I came out
Awesome!! That top is wayyy too cute! 💕
Awesome and u look so good in them as well…. Think the only Guy things I’d keep is the hoodies since well I like hoodies haha
This is an certified epic
Ooh! That top is amazing. You look cute 😍
Your face is so cute! Love that hair style on you!
I am still incredibly jealous of your hair Jfkvkdkfk 😖😖

~ A pre everything transfem
clothes don't have gender! lol

so happy for you that your wardrobe is giving you all the gender euphoria!! love that shirt
Well I still like to dress like a butch lesbian so my 'male' clothes have a good place in my heart
I kept my band shirts and threw everything else out. I found an old pair of jeans the other day I must have forgot about, tried them on and they felt so weird...and wrong.

Pockets were amazing though.
You look so pretty!
Congratulations 🎊
Jealous 🫠
Congrats! May I ask how long it took you to switch from a majority-masculine wardrobe to a majority-feminine? Would you be willing to describe the process a bit, I.e., what did you buy first, discard first, etc.?
And you look gorgeous in them!
Wait you have closets, dang I have a dresser. Though that's pretty cool that you have that much girl clothes. I don't have any, or I think I wouldn't look good in them 😂.
Love this for you but please remember there is no such thing as “girl” clothes and “boy” clothes.
I remember throwing out like boxer briefs and feeling a huge surge of euphoria when I thought to myself “you don’t wear these anymore..”
You're rocking this shirt and it looks amazing, I wonder where you got form?







I wish if I can transition...
Nice 👍
Oh you look so good too! I can't wait to even hit the 10% mark myself. I've only got a few shirts.
Work it, girl! Ah-ooh-ga!!
Herzlichen Glückwunsch
Jealous of your hair and wardrobe hahaha but im really happy for you!!
Crazy thing, right, is that all clothes a girl wears are girl clothes 🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯🤯
You look like you're trying not to smile you're so pretty and cute and wholesome and fashionable and and and--
So cute!
WOO! You go, queen!
There’s always some “boy” clothes in a girls closet! You’re beautiful and your wardrobe is perfect
Hell yeah sister! My wardrobe is now all my girls clothes only, now I just need to fill the empty space 🤔
:')
You go be your beautiful self
Yay! I’m so proud of you! 

I threw out almost all of my guy clothes when I moved a few weeks ago because fuck boymoding. (I kept some of the pants because pockets) 

It’s so freeing! I hope everything goes amazing for you :)
Mine too, because we're girls :)
you're so pretty i want to hug you so bad rn
yaasss gurrrllll!! im so happy for you!
Damn girl! You look beautiful! Dont let anyone tell you otherwise!
Yeah, but you're really pretty.  You can't not look good in either!
🥰
Cute 😍
That's amazing
You're gorgeous aswell
Wow😍
Wow! So pretty!
You are so pretty
Perfect decision 😍💯
Can’t wait for that day!  You are very cute girl!!
Cute!
Cute!
I wanna see your. Butt so cute
🤯!!!
There’s no way I’m getting rid of over ten years worth of collecting band shirts!
still need to boymode every now and then but soon!! 🙌
I can't find ""girls clothes"" work pants that are actually durable and most of the women in trades I know say to just wear ""men's"" work pants so... 

Which is funny bc my body is a VERY different shape than it was 3 years ago but I'm still wearing the same work pants and they fit me VERY differently.
Tip for anyone throwing out clothes: You can donate them instead (granted they aren't totally ruined and not underwear)
Tq!! Ruined me financially but had to get it 💖
Hehehe tq!! And yess hoodies are 4ever 🤘🤘
The secret is Chinese black bean soup, pass it along 🍲
Ey you're right!! And tq hehe
Sure! Took me about 2 years ish? I first bought stuff like jackets and sweaters to layer on top of my usual stuff, around the same time I started giving away half of my shirts (and kept the other half for boymoding). Kept stuff like jeans and hoodies, and now all it's just cropped tops and skirts HAHA
Too kind!! :')
💯
Literally me last year 🤝
From Hollister hehe 

And you defo can ✊
very soon 😈
vielen vielen Dank ✨
😳🤯
HAHA pls I'm usually bad with selfies and couldn't take myself seriously so I was stifling a giggle 😂😂
💖✨💖✨
Legit what they said, I've still got some old ""boy"" clothes just cause they're comfy, but they're still girl clothes because I'm a girl. :)

Hell I might even buy a guy's sweater sometime in the future if it looks comfy enough it's all about what you like and what you're comfortable with!
I have found a company here in New Zealand who have tradie skorts, Bisley I think their name is...I'm getting one for when I start my construction and engineering courses at uni (going back to uni in my 40s)...
I didn't throw them out, I did donate them, I only said I threw them out as a figure of speech
Worth it! Lol 😆
oh and your glasses! you've got a whole 🔥 look
Thank you.




I unfortunately can't transition (yet) considering where I live and everything surrounding me, so all I can do is wait for that day to come.
It's hard right now but I'll definitely make sure to live as my true self one day.

Same, i usually just flash a big ol toothy awkward grin like a shark lol

""How do smile, how do pose????""
So by this definition I have to be naked next time I travel through Tennessee. Since all clothes would be girl clothes and they don't like that
I just say they are my ""ex's clothes"" because I didn't specify what type of ex.  Ex gender, that is.
In my blind era 😎
Can relate, took me many years to get secure as well so please hang in there 🫂
Looks like Tennessee is in for a show. Lucky them lol
😆 I'd arrest myself if I saw my ugly ass naked  in public 😂
Surely you're being too hard on yourself.

I love your look! You make me miss my septum ring, BTW, what's on your shirt?
Gorgeous!💕💕💕

Cuuuute
Looking amazing
Adorable! You go girl!
Wow you look so freaking cute aaaah!!! Could you give me some makeup tips because you just NAILED it <3 and I LOVE the septum piercing :D
You go girl!  I love that top.  Where can I get one?
If more and more people could just be comfortable in their own skin, whether it's the one they are born with or the one they embrace, hatred wouldn't be a thing. It's sad that people would say you can't exist simply because you don't fit their norm. Rock your style gorgeous!
Adorable!!!!
You beautiful as always 💜💜
You are so cute! And also congrats :)
You look like you. Very nice.
your makeup looks awesome
Oww you're so pretty

Thank you!! I hope I stay out too! I already tossed out like 99% of my “boy” clothes 😅
yeah I was just randomly scrolling and then came across this and this is how i felt lol
It was terrifying but I’m really looking forward to next time ☺️
Makeup and hrt lol
Thank you!! Definitely up for makeup tips! I’ve been practicing a BUNCH lately and it’s finally finally paying off lol

Lol all of mine are gone I didn’t even give it a second thought
That’s great!  And I think you look very beautiful ☺️ I hope the next time goes great!
Yess! I can see that it's absolutely gorgeous! Especially the blush looks so cuuuute :D
Okay Cool and thanks  - you rock!

I kept them bc women aren't treated stupid if they wear typical male clothes unlike the other way around
The eye makeup is a combo of the sailor moon palette from colourpop and jaclyn hills morphe palette no. 2. The blush is the sailor moon one too, in the name of the moon I think it was called? And then the highlighter is precious petals by wet n wild! ☺️
Yeah and if you're good with a sewing machine you can tailor your clothes to fit better if you have a favorite shirt or pair of jeans
Yesss! Make them shirts cropped!

Parents found the skirt drawer	So, basically, I get home from my friends house at like 1:20 am. I don’t expect my parents to be awake, but my stepdad is, and immediately confronts me about some clothes he found under my bed (all skirts, thigh high socks, etc). Basically he makes me explain to him that I wear them (pretty obvious IMO) and wouldn’t admit that’s it’s super weird he cares about this. Not sure why I have to explain it to them, but I pass it off as just crossdressing, still embarrassing but luckily they’re not smart enough to realize I’m trans from it. Anyways, just wanted to vent a tad bit, not having the best day because of it 😅 how are y’all doin?	"I'm sorry to hear that this happened don't let it break you. stay strong! I hope your day gets better
SO IM NOT THE ONLY ONE WITH A SKIRT AND THIGH HIGHS DRAWER

...interesting
This could potentially be a blessing in disguise! My girlfriend “caught me” twice: first she found some of my lingerie and later she discovered photos of myself in drag. Both times I pretended it was a crossdressing fetish, but it also forced me to open up to her. Ultimately I came out to her as trans, but I doubt I ever would have gotten there if those situations hadn’t forced my hand.
I'm so happy that you're safe! Take care of yourself and your stuff!
Fuck your dad. Sorrynotsorry
I had the same thing happen as a teenager. A few months later I was being obnoxious and digging through my my dads stuff and found his own stash of cross dressing cloths. Something about stones and glass houses...
I was always so paranoid of that I used to hide all my stuff in a dead pc tower
My mum found my lingerie the other day 😳
that kinda shit can be so traumatic, im sorry that happened OP. im still scarred from when my parents confronted me after finding my myspace page in high school 😂
My first question is why are they rummaging through your clothes? That would irritate me if my family did that
That was an opportunity to come out! Hope it works out. Did they keep your stuff?
As a parent, this makes me so sad. As if you don’t have enough to deal with navigating the waters as a young person. Does wearing a skirt or thigh high socks change who you are at your core? Are you a kind, generous, forgiving person who has convictions? If the answer is yes, then you are a parent’s dream.
That sucks that things work out like that. It's most unfortunate. I remember asking my mom to buy me a purse when I was 10, surprisingly she did. And at 15 I asked her to buy me a pair of heels while we were shopping because I was too embarrassed to buy them myself at the register, and she did. I say these things because my hope is that someday, when you're ready, you'll have the courage to just tell them this is who you are and nothing can change that regardless if they ""approve"" or not. You do not need anyone's approval to be who you are. While it would be very comforting and relieve you of anxiety to have your parent's ""approval"", you simply don't need it to be you. No one can change who you are, so don't pretend to be someone you're not. Like I said, this is all when YOU are ready, not when you think they'll be ready to hear what you have to say. I hope this helps you in some way, even if it's only a little. 😘
Hugs to you.  I'm nearly fifty and my parents have both passed.  I remember being in high school when my mom found my pantyhose, womens jeans and bra tucked away under the bed.  Interesting discussion. And then a girlfriend in college did the same.  And later my wife when I finally came out and decided to transition.  

It does get better.  Is it safe for you to use this at all as an opportunity to have a frank discussion with your parents about your needs? Would they be supportive given time?
I'm a cosplayer so I always just kept my stuff in plain sight and no one questioned anything.
I was in the exact same position as you and played it off as crossdressing, only to regret not just coming out when my mom found my clothes. Took me 2 years to work up the courage to tell her it was more than just crossdressing.

Idk if you feel ready/safe to come out, but if you're on the fence about it I'd say just rip the bandaid off now while it's still fresh.

Also, if they were cool with you crossdressing then I'm willing to bet they'll be okay with you being trans.
That’s an invasion of your privacy. Remember this.
SNEAKY TRANS SOUNDS
Geesh fuck that. You gotta get out as soon as you can hun
I’m sorry to hear that, I hope that your situation improves. No offence, but your dad sounds like a knobhead
I got a skirt in my clothes cupboard where it wont be obvious that they are there😋😝
Hugs 🤗
I know this is a serious post and I definitely feel for you sis, plus I totally panicked after my mom outed me to my dad, but I need to know.. is the format supposed to be like “mom found the piss jar” (just for my own mental health)
My personal history would be screaming don't get in the car with folks going anywhere.  That trip changed my life very much badliest.  Be careful bcs some folks do some messed up things to ""save their kid"".  Probably nothing, but my own shadows, but I wouldn't wish them on an enemy.  TC
""Not smart enough to realize I'm trans from it."" What?
I still need to think of a good hiding spot for my clothes when I return for the summer... my parents love to search.
You just described my childhood.
Why the fuck parents think it's okay to search their kids rooms. This ain't prison
Hey you do you bby💚 find out where you belong. PLS never regret anything that makes you smile (something doesn't hurt anyone obviously) and in this case that is harmless. I'm so sorry for that harassment. 

Continue on your journey of self discovery & self love. I'm here for you💚💚💚😇

 I'm sure you look lovely in those clothes. Much love pumpkin 😻 😘
Cosplay/ Halloween/ it’s a dare/ my friends dared me to do it or something along the lines of that can be good excuses if it comes up again
When I was still in the closet and this happened to me. They asked: “Why do you have women’s underwear?” And without skipping a beat I went “ Because I’m a pervert.” And then I just thought “Oh shi-“
That happened to me too... altough my mom knew right away what was up... that was not a fun way to come out.
[deleted]
I'm so sorry that they even care in the first place, I also cant even imagine what its like to have parents who go through my things, I forget how privileged I am when it comes to that. Hopefully you have or will meet friends who can help you and be supportive.
this is the “mum found the piss drawer” of being trans..

anyway hope ur doing ok sweetie, can’t of been fun, also hope you at least had some cute skirts in there, much love
lol I remember when I was a kid and I used to dream of the day I was an adult, so I could buy woman's clothes.
I hope everything works out ok. I got caught crossdressing as a teenager by my mom. She never let me forget it. She knows that my wife has put me in chastity and diapers and is very amused by it. But I’ve never gotten over how she belittled me when I was young
i couldn't find a bigger oof even if i played roblox
I made my mum buy me a binder in February (she had no idea what it did) and I wear it a few times a week and my dad realised I was wearing something A MONTH later and both of them still can't figure out that I'm trans for better or worse :')
at least you didn't get kicked out of your room, all your electronics taken away, and almost kicked out of the house

(thats what happened to me when they found my crossdressing clothes)
mine found the piss drawer ☹
... soooooo curious... they're ok if you cross dress,  but not if your trans? That's weird
I haven't got much male clothing yet.  My sister was asking me why I was wearing boxers.  I told her it's none of her business and told her to fuck off.  (can't stand her anyways) So then she comes in a couple days later to our room and goes hey do you like these shorts?  (they're boxer briefs with some sort of pattern on them)  I'm like those are underwear.  She goes no I wear them as shorts at camp something you wouldn't know about.  Like who tf wears boxer briefs as shorts?!
So when I first read that title, I thought it was about a person who draws skirts onto public restroom signs. I don’t know why. 

Anyway, I’m sorry your dad was a git about it. I don’t understand why anyone cares. Did he think you were secretly a cam girl? Like, that’s the only reason a parent should care what clothing their minor is wearing — if they think it’s related to prostitution.
One of the most liberating moments I’ve had on this path to self-realization was Contrapoints saying, “these aren’t women’s clothes...they’re my clothes.”

Whether your clothes are women’s clothes or not doesn’t even matter, they’re yours. That’s your identity to choose. 

With all due respect, and in the words of Richard Pryor, your parents (stepdad especially) “can have a coke and a smile and shut the fuck up.”

Good vibes, Op. You’re a total badass.
What kind of a retard interrogates their stepchild about something as innocuous as clothing? Sorry that happened.
That happened to me but after I came out to them and they didn’t accept me
Stay strong? Your parents will never be convinced because you are mentally ill and need to be treated!
When I was younger I had a message written out for anyone who went through my stuff. Something like, ""you're the weird one for going through my stuff, enjoy what you see."" 
Right next to the several pages of b/w yaoi. (Folded up) What an uproar when my bitch step mom found that lmao 

People who snoop through other ppls stuff. Yuck.
I once would keep a decoy ‘porn and drugs’ box in front of the ‘skirts and dresses stolen from Walmart’ box never had the horror of someone finding either one though 😖
(888) 932-6360
I decided to grow my hair out a teny tiny little bit, and my parents threw a fit, I just want it a bit longer than normal, not even lower than my neck
Thank you (´ω｀)
Hid it in a lava lamp box How'd they find it smh ✋😓
Nah, I just need a whole drawer for that sort of thing, I like my fem clothing separated 🤣
Bahahaha, all the awards I don't have to give
I just got my first thing of thigh highs today, feeling nice tho-
I have one but it's because I have work and casual wear seperated.
for me it's an under bed skirt world lol. i think everyone here hes one of those gender affirming stash
I personally like to ""store"" them on plastics bags and hide them in other clothes or literally inside blankets.
I’m just not sure if I want to tell my parents at all about this. They’re super pushy and don’t take my concerns seriously, so I’m not inclined to believe they’ll react well to me being trans.
Did that affect your relationship at all?
Is she still your girlfriend ?
Thanks!!! You too!!!
Dw I felt the same way !
Damn did you talk to him about that?
That's a good idea.  If I had a PC at home I would do that s I plan to have a dual monitor set up.  The dead PC would ""run the other monitor""  no one in my family would know the difference since they're really stupid when it comes to tech.
If only I had one, not a bad idea
Omg I absolutely love your username 🤣 and I’m just glad I don’t have anything dirty or explicitly trans! That could’ve gone much worse. Hope your parents are accepting
Luckily I’m very low key with social media, so my parents will never find out
I would love to know but it was very late and I had work early this morning... I did not even find the time to ask between them lecturing me
I know, it was just super awkward and sudden and I’m not sure I want to be open with my parents since I don’t have any place to go I things go badly. And no, thankfully they didn’t take anything, unless they do it while I’m at work
I wish I could say I was a good kid, but that’s not really the case. I acted out really badly though middle school and high school, and haven’t really repaired my relationship with my parents since then either. It’s just difficult for me to talk to ppl who ignore my anxiety and start yelling/arguing when I criticize them at all.
It’s nice to hear some encouragement, thank you ☺️
I’ll have to see about that. But i can’t repress myself any longer, I don’t have the energy for it
Not quite open with my desire to cosplay yet, I wish I had your confidence!
I’m thinking about this but I need to make plans first, just to be safe. Thank you for telling me this though, I definitely don’t want to repress myself any longer.
I will. If they continue like this I will leave.
This was my entire life at home growing up. Nothing but a long, continuous invasion of privacy.
(´ω｀)
Thank you, I will try to soon
He seemed like less of a knobhead before last night, ngl 😅
Here’s hoping you have less nosy parents than me
Yes it was based on that 🤣 I don’t know why but it’s the first thing that came to my mind when I woke up this morning lmao
I haven’t hid my being trans terribly well... I just don’t think they’re intuitive enough to notice that sort of thing.
Try behind a drawer or shelf that doesn’t move normally
I had a few too many pairs of socks and skirts for that unfortunately
Damn.... glad I didn’t word it like that 🤣 that dysphoria do be hittin tho, ngl
Damn how did she know? Were there obvious signs?
Didn’t think about it like that but yes I did 🤣
Of course, even a Japanese schoolgirl outfit or two, just to be safe
Hm? Is this a helpline?
Lava lamp box?  Definitely looking for drugs😜
Lol I hide mine in my carry case for my Warhammer Figures, since they have absolutely no reason to touch it
I know what you are talking about! I used to have a similar drawer just with all my girl stuff. Then in time it became 2 drawers, then the whole dresser, then my closet too, and now I no longer own any of my old boy clothes! But I can’t imagine how mortified I would have been if my parents saw it, let alone confronted me about it!
Congrats!!! Enjoy em!!
Perhaps not now, but you might want to tell them eventually, and this could make it easier because it won’t be as big of a surprise. You know them best, and situations like this can be revealing on what their views are or how they’ll react. You might be able to slowly open up over time by talking about it with them more. Coming out is YOUR decision and you don’t need to tell them anything if you don’t want to, but try to stay positive because even low moments like this can have a positive result in the end!
It did for a while. The first instance, she felt really shocked and weirded out, and we had to talk through it a lot (plus she thought the lingerie belonged to another girl and that I was cheating, so there were trust issues as well). I felt like it was a dark cloud hanging over us for a while but it eventually evaporated and we rarely discussed it. The second time was less of a shock but it forced me to open up to her more and explain what I was going through. Both times I revealed a little more about myself, which allowed me to start wearing leggings around her, using nail polish, and shaving my body hair. By the time I came out to her as trans, she kind of was expecting it by then and she was super supportive!
Yes, and she’s totally supportive of my transition!
I'll forever feel that about anyone that's so disgusting. This took me back to my teenage years and what an awful feeling having to be confronted like that.
He was a born-again Christian so he was filled with so much shame that he could never talk about it. He was stuck on me invading his privacy and disrespecting him as the man of the house (mind you my mom brought in 90% of the income.)
So frustrating, what is there even to lecture you about? Deflecting from his invasive behavior to project his toxic shit :( I hope you feel safe one day soon to be open in your identity to anyone you wish to share it with. You deserve to feel safe as you be♥️
erring on the side of caution is always a good move, I'm glad they're seemingly cool with the 'crossdressing' cover. May your luck hold up until you're able to live openly!
If my mum took women's clothes off of me I'd lose it since I buy them myself I'm assuming you do too
Acting out in middle school and high school is par for the course! Did your parents ever want to know the underlying reason for acting out?? At those ages until you’re about 25 you REQUIRE parental intervention and guidance to keep your actions (mental health?) in check. Do my kids hate me sometimes?? Of course. It’s expected. If they do something inherently wrong I will call them out on their shit. That’s my job. But they always know that behind the complete bitch I can be, is a parent who will ALWAYS support them, guide them and love them, and never shame them for the individuals they are.
You are most welcome young lady ☺
I'm not saying this is a perfect solution, but if they have problems maybe you can ask to see a gender therapist? It helps to sometimes have an ally on your side advocating for you, and the therapist might also help explain options to you and provide access to other providers depending on where and when you to further explore options. 

Good luck.  I'm sorry you have to navigate this.  It's hard, but it does get better.
Just something to mull over, i know you got a lot on your mind...

what if you used this event as an opportunity ""test the waters"" if you will, and talk to your parents and say you wanted to be a cosplayer; you were just to embarrassed to bring it up to them and you froze when they asked you about it. 

Best case scenario, it's an easy step for them to understand, it allows you some space and understanding from your parents when you need to ""try out an outfit"" perhaps? hopefully, this would alleviate some tension until you can move out?

Worst case scenario might be that they call your bluff, and you out yourself to them. I am 33 now, but I remember those ""can you come into the living room for a minute? we need to talk about something"" talks. oh, lord they were the worst. I do not envy where you are right now. As such, though, I recognize that if you did try to use the cosplay angle, I would want to make sure you are in a safe spot to do so if that conversation goes poorly. Parents who have a tendency to parent in an authoritarian way can often discipline fiercely. I hope your parents are more understanding than this.
I... hmm. That might not be a good idea depending on your situation. Trust me, living with shit parents is marginally better than being homeless. I’d recommend you maintain a support network just in case, though.
We all have “those” days.. ahaha
Rereading it now I think it made sense.  I thought the clothes made you trans, like physically changed you, which was kind of confusing.  Obviously you mean they weren't smart enough to realize you were trans because of the clothing.  Carry on.
Queeeeeeeen
Hopefully
That reminds me that my mom took my weed and gave to her not-boyfriend so he could smoke it :(
Stg... just so uncomfortable :/ kinda wish they’d just left it alone and assumed I was crossdressing themselves but I need to spell everything out for them...
Thank you, I’ll see about telling them after I make sure I have a place to stay if it goes badly
That’s pretty cool. I know that a lot of the times it’s hard to maintain previous relationships after coming out as trans, especially if your partner is straight.
Wow that’s good don’t see a lot of those stories ending well!
Yeah... my parents are pretty bad with the way they confront me. They basically ignore my anxiety and ruin my day when they do it.
Damn that sounds like some deep repression. Hopefully you don’t live there still?
Yh, hearing that annoyed me. What is there to lecture about? And why did their dad question them about the clothes, none of his business.
Thank you!!
Yeah, same
Thank you for this
That is something I need to look into, thank you for bringing that up!
Lol np I describe things in a weird way 🤣
Had an Aunt angrily tell me she had confiscated some of my weed (about a joints worth) when I stayed with them as a teen. Like, come on, this was (is) one of my favorite aunts. I would have totally shared. 

Edit: she was totally right to be mad, we were on a trip across state lines, and I didn’t tell her I had weed...
“Ugh, Mom and Dad, obviously I need that stuff in order to do Femboy Fridays! You don’t know about Femboy Fridays? Everyone does Femboy Fridays now, I can’t believe you haven’t heard of it.”
Well the only good thing is that it does create some context for when you do come out. My parent never had a clue I had been dressing since I was 7. So they were a little caught off guard when I came out. But this also could be an opening for you since you have to explain yourself to them anyways, might as well get it over with rather than having to explain again that you’re trans and what that means. But that of course would be only if you are comfortable and ready to! Otherwise it’s not worth it!
Good answer. Have a plan in case things go south.
Your parents are the ones with the problem. Don't let them make you feel anxious about who you are. Good luck! 💙
I’m 36 with my own family but that repression regressed my own progress about 20 years before I could face I might not be CIS. He’s long dead but his shame haunted me for a long time. It’s part of the reason I am anti-theist.
I'm going to buy a really cute outfit on Friday only thing that annoys me is my mum won't let me go out in girlmode
Also if you can't speak to your parents directly about it then you could try composing a letter and leaving it for them. And if they continue to give you a hard time then maybe it's time to leave home. 

Trust me, repressing this is the worst possible outcome.
I didn't exactly tell my mom either... but it's my personal opinion that I'm an adult and she shouldn't go through my room, even if her lying, thieving, _not_ -boyfriend tells her he smelled weed in my room.

On the awesome side though, I thought she'd found it all- which would've been like $10ish of unpacked buds and one joint, but then I found the joint and a small bud that I'd put in a plastic bag the last time I smoked.

She confiscated my pipe though, so I can't exactly smoke that unless I get another one or learn how to roll joint...
So u hate Christians?
I’m sorry to hear that, is there any way you could sneak out of the house in girlmode though? I’ve changed at someone else’s before I went out too, maybe you could try that?
My wife won’t let me out either until she can divorce me.
Make a water bottle bong
Get a rolling machine. Little tiny gadget, weed goes between the rollers, paper in top, filter at one end, lick and stick, BOOM perfect every time. Cost you about 3 bucks. The finer you grind the more perf your doob will be. Old hippie here, I know whence I speak ❤️
Anti-theists hate the sin, not the sinners
Anttheists:People who don't believe in God/gods but would murrder them and topple their thrones if they showed up. As for other humans, we good. Humans aren't what were against.
Yeah I guess I'm home alone a lot so there's nothing stopping me
She's a bitch do what you want who cares what she thinks
i'll prob try that tbh
Oh makes sense, thanks

My parents are policing my clothes!	My parents keep making me wear clothes that are really feminine and tighter around the chest, everywhere I go because “it looks nicer and less sloppy” and won’t let me wear shirts that doesn’t show the outline of my chest that are just as nice as the others but are not feminine as crap and have told me that “because your not a boy your not allowed under any circumstance to wear boy clothes” even more my mother was like “you used to wear dresses and be pretty. I miss that” I’m so mad.	"You could try makeing them wildly uncomfortable by telling them to stop sexualizeing you by forceing you to wear reveling clothing
Your parents need to chill out and eat some rocks
Aw, i’m sorry you’re in that situation, parents who police what their children wear are the worst. Are you out to them? if so you could try to reasonable follow up to that, of you aren’t allowed to wear fem clothes since you’re not fem (rip nb people I guess they only get big hoodies and sweatpants)
Would showing them baggy t shirts that happen to be from the women’s department help? Also sorry about the shit parents :(
I'm sorry you have to go through this. Hopefully you're close to 18 so they won't have a say in your clothes any more. If it's reached that boiling point though, wait until your in a public place with a lot of people and yell at them about how creepy it is that they are sexualizing their own child; and that you aren't some doll to dress up, you're a person, one that they should care about.
That, my dear friend, should be child abuse. Children are not your property. the parent is a caretaker not an owner.
My bio parents used to do that too😢

Don’t worry. You got this. You’ll get through it.
Honestly how does your clothing choice hurt them in any tangible way? 

I’m sorry you are dealing with this, they are being ridiculous/absurd. I hope you are able to move out of that situation and be yourself when you are able. They cannot control you forever.

Best of luck!

Edit: spelling
My mom said the same thing except it was for spirit week she said ""you can't wear that and pretend You're a boy"" then proceeds to say ""I can easily kick you out but I'm not becouse you my daughter"" like wtf
Ask them why they're grooming you :)
r/insaneparents would be the perfect subreddit also for this. I'd tell them that the clothes you are forcing me to wear isn't me and is super uncomfortable. I'm a tomboy / street clothes, I like the look and feel to be able to express myself. I love you, but this needs to stop. I am my own person. Somewhere among those lines until you are 18. Kids / teens need to express themselves. As a parent myself, I only limit so much but that is out of common sense.
Just tell them theyre groomers who are obsessed with sexualising your body for perverts to stare at and its not okay.

If they keep pushing it, just send your fem stuff to a thrift shop and see if you can trade them for dudes clothes. 

Honestly your parents need to get this image of who they want you to be out of there heads, its a fantasy, it doesnt exist, it isnt you. You need to make a show of how discontent you are. Just dont push it so far that you are at risk of having nowhere to stay.
I have clothes big enough come over and we can have fun together going out in public
Tell your parents to touch some grass and read a book. This is your life, not theirs.
My idea is going to suck, but... Wear the sexiest, most revealing clothes. Hear me out. Wear them, and when people tell you you look hot, tell them your age. If you're younger, people are going to question it. When they do, tell them you don't want to wear it, but your parents make you. It's gonna suck while you're doing it, but if it works, you won't have to wear them anymore. Not the best idea, but when some creepy old man starts hitting on you, hope fully your parents are going to see how stupid they are.
[removed]
Every single cis girl I know wears *some* kind of ""guy's"" clothes, it's completely normal. Usually parents police clothes to make sure they're NOT too revealing. Maybe tell them you want the baggier shapeless clothes because you don't like how people look at you with the other ones?
Yeah I’m going to add to the echo chamber and say they sound like groomers. There is no logical reason they would want you to reveal your body. I’m sure they have plenty of whacky-doodle arguments but there are zero reasons. 

“You used to wear dresses and be pretty” ok so your birthgiver needs to have another child or invest in a really nice doll to play with (which isn’t helping her case sound stable). I am fairly certain she has plenty of clothes that she used to wear that anyone can pull out of thin air and say I missed when you looked pretty and less old.

OR we can be kind and respectful and adore the uniqueness that is our child and not sexualize them but that would just be too simple and… well… compassionate. :)
Unfortunately this is a tale as old as time. I was 12-14 years old in the early 2000s, and my parents constantly policed my outfits. My mother equally wanted me to “not dress like a boy” but was concerned about Modesty- you can’t have it both ways. I’m sorry they’re putting you through this.
My mom completely lost her shit when I was leaving for college and bought a pair of cargo shorts with my money but I did it anyway 

I was allowed to wear t-shirts and jeans but they had to be from the women's section 

I was eventually able to move out and buy what I wanted to wear and it was extremely liberating
Throw your moms pants in the trash. Pants aren't appropriate for women lol.
Man your parents suck.
I would have tore the clothes right in front of them if I were you.
That's stupid. They're denying the fact that you might be trans and that's gross of them.
This is not normal. I am so sorry u have to deal with it, it's even worse considering you're transgender.
Ugh. That's such bullshit. You're not a possession or an extension of their will. I hate that they're not treating you like your own person. You should be able to wear what you want and express yourself however you want.

As a parent, hearing things like this makes my blood boil on your behalf. You deserve better. :(

Edit: changed a noun to a verb
This is so real, because my parents are supposedly “allies” but then I go shopping with my mom and all she says is “you need nicer clothes, you look homeless, just come to the womens isle because it will all fit you so much better I promise it will still be androgynous” and then it’s like a ruffly floral tight ass top.
I’m going to guess that you’re under 18, and/or can’t move out? In that case, maybe try to pretend you’re an actor or a spy? Or a drag Queen. It’s not ideal, but tbh I don’t know that you have a lot of choices, unfortunately; your parents don’t seem like the reasonable type :/

I have faith in you though. Some day soon, you’ll be looking back on these days from the outside, having made it through. You got this!
Say you want to wear boy clothes to be modest
A nice reminder is that you dont exist for their amusement. It’s not about them. You aren’t a doll. Hell, go buy her a barbie and have her dress that up.
Wow! What they are doing is so really majorly disgusting.
I don't see how this type of parent thinks you're going to keep coming over after you've turned 18. Right now the law says they can do (almost) whatever they want basically, but when you're an adult, it's not like you'd have forgotten all they've done, and still they're really surprised when their kid doesn't visit them
Hmm, if you want to be sneaky and have a good friend who wears the kind of stuff you would prefer, you could ask if they have any fitting clothes to spare. Along with that, if you have a bag or something to hide it in, and then change whenever you get where you want to. Not sure how much they helicopter you, but having a second outfit you prefer that you can switch in and out of could be nice,  just know people talk and she would eventually figure out. 

But it's your life, not hers, and you likely know how she would react already. As long as it's more of her being ""disappointed"" then angry, I honestly think it's something she could grow past. And if faced with it, she will have to contend with if she loves the child she has, or the one envisioned in her head (and likely some bullshit about children if she's trying to make you attract boys).
Your parents apparently don’t understand that clothing can be unisex.
T-shirts, sweatpants, sneakers, all unisex. I’d say to try to find a binder you can hide at a friends or school. Then no one will be seeing your chest no matter how many blouses they make you wear. Heck, add a packer for an extra screw you.
My mom was the same way. It was so irritating and saddening. My heart goes out to you.
This is a form of abuse called coercive abuse. So go to the police if it’s a big problem
That’s what my parents did when I was in middle school, too.
At some point I just stop putting on feminine clothes regardless what they say. Parents were mad at first but they couldn‘t forcefully do anything with me and the clothings. If they buy some feminine clothings which I didn’t approve from the beginning, I will never put them on so they will find out it’s a waste of money. Gradually parents start to respect what I want to wear, then
Tbh you could burn all your clothes to prove a point. I know it is expensive and probably more money to spend on newer clothes that you like. But they can’t force you to wear feminine clothes if you don’t have any left
i’m a firm believer in “if you want to stop people from asking u to do something, just do it really bad.” like when i was younger - i would either do it in hiding (change in the bathrooms at school/friends etc) or i would take it to such a place they have no choice. like. im a trans woman but if lil me were in ur shoes i might go with “oh u want revealing and form fitting lmao….” and then roll up in an xtina eary 2000s get up
A lot of cis girls wear their boyfriends clothes. Get a fake boyfriend (or real one, post doesn't indicate sexuality) and say you're wearing his clothes
That’s fucking repulsive. I know it’s hard but you need to say something. This is more than gender they are forcefully sexualizing you without your consent. Fucking tell everyone you know that your parents make you wear revealing outfits when you don’t want to. Holy shit. What the fuck
if you’d be comfortable with it, wear the most ridiculously revealing feminine outfit possible and if they say something just say it’s because they told you to
Pull any flannel or oversize shirts out of her closet and tell her she can't wear them either, or better yet swapher whole wardrobe with oversized baggy stuffs
Parents think they can control their kids, like somehow your not an individual. They’ll never get what they want really, and in due time you’ll get exactly what you want. They’ll just have to hold on desperately for now while the sand slips right through they’re grubby fingers
I hate when parents try to control thier kids, my mom tries to control me the same way
Damn that’s horrible. You should have the freedom to wear what you want. i am sorry that your parents are so restrictive and discriminatory. You are valid and i hope that they change or that you can find an escape.
""You used to not mind other people's business and be nice. I miss that"".
I fought with my mother over this literally from the time I started school. She was OBSESSED with me wearing dresses to school. Even when she found out that was an outdated notion, she wouldn't drop the insistence that I MUST wear a dress of her choosing to school on the first day of the school year. One year the dress she bought me was so outlandish that one of my high school teachers threatened to call my mother! LMFAO   I begged her to do that, to send me home to change clothes. No dice. My advice: leave home as soon as you graduate.
I don't usually condone murder, but...
calmly remind them that wearing what you want makes you happy. and that you dont mind what other people think about it. if that doesnt work its not your fault, they are controlling and destroying your own boundaries. you are your own person and are allowed to do something as innocent as expressing yourself through what you wear and being you.
My mom also doesn’t let me wear men’s clothing and it makes me uncomfortable, but she’s never that strict about what I wear ):
Let me guess... Country of freedom?
UGH SAME HERE. THEY LITERALLY TOOK AWAY NEARLY ALL THE STUFF I BOUGHT WITH *MY* MONEY. I WORK. I'M SO FUCKING ANGRY
my parents r just like this.. clothes shopping is an actual nightmare I get sick going into stores
Omg my mom is the same way ""wear makeup for your stepdad"" or ""wear a dress instead of a flannel with a bowtie"" ""here take this thong"" like jeez I'm only a kid (I just.mean under 18)
Just go to the opposite extreme. Wear exceedingly tight, revealing clothes that exaggerate feminine sexuality, and ensure you flaunt it in front of them. 

If they refuse to acknowledge your gender identity choices, then make them uncomfortable with theirs.
It's very strange that they want you to wear tight clothes. This, as well as their comments to you, make me think that they suspect you might be transgender, and that that's why they're doing this
So, I got a fight w mom for this kind of topic, like she bought a sandal I did not want, it’s too girly, I didnt wear it, she’s mad, and criticized me and told me mot to call her mom until I figured out about my action. My colleague heard my story and tell me, wait for a moment, whole family is having fun, and make a confession, telling them this is you, they can forcefully change you now, but when they’re gone, or you leave the house, you’ll be just like you are. Say that, family supposed to be rely on, for you to be confident about yourself, not taking criticism so much that makes you have a bad thought and do not wanted to face them or even dont wanna come home, you love them, and you want a happy family, but you also wanted to be you yourself, if family keeps on forcing you like that, happy is no longer a term for you to define about family.
Explain them gently, dont cause more hatred, it’ll makes things worse. And if they still not understand, it’s time to leave home (only if you’re enough old due to your country’s law to be independent, otherwise, find some allies to defend you).
Wtf?! That’s super messed up.
God I hate people like that I'm so sorry about that and I hope you can convince them overwise but I don't think you can with the information I have here
Fuck that, if your parents want you to wear clothes like that they can dress you by hand or let you wear what you want. I’m so sorry they’re treating you that way.
I’m so sorry, your situation sounds really bad.
Think about family members that could support you, or legal help in your state.
Their obsession to FORCE you and not allow you to wear whatever you want is violent asf.

Even emancipation could be a last good stance. Obviously only you know your situation
can we guess whos going to the retirement home?
Relatable. I feel you OP. I feel you.
They’re not only being transphobic but they’re hyper sexualizing you so they can look at you like how society sees women as sex icons because (no offense) they think in their little pea brains that that’s how women should be. (Which isn’t true at all)
I’m going to guess that you’re a minor so you should talk to a consular about this but keep in mind that some(most/all) school councilors tell parents what their kids say.
Now after all that said, there’s still ways to make yourself look masculine and have a flatter chest.
1. Trans tape(online)/ KT tape (pharmacy)
2. Binders (online or target)
3. Contour your face to look more masculine and you can even add a shadow over your lips with eye shadow a bit darker than your skin tone. You can get mascara that is close to your hair color and use it in your eyebrows very lightly to make them bushier

I don’t know how else to help but I wish you the best
I'm sorry you're dealing with this OP, it sounds awful. It sounds like you parents are being controlling just for the sake of it. Tell them that forcing you into dressing a certain way makes you uncomfortable and if they won't listen donate all those feminine clothes or trade them for something you like. Your parents will be mad, but it's your body, not theirs, and if they don't understand that then what they're doing is not out of love or concern for you; it's selfish and borders on abuse. Talk to a school counselor or reach out to a local support group about it if you can, bc this is not okay.
Fucking cut them up. Slash them to goddamned ribbons. Burn the fuck out of them (safely).
My mum says the same thing selfish and a narcacist god she's so retarded don't put up with their shit as soon as possible change your last name and find a new family they don't deserve you
[removed]
They have no right to do that. It's abuse and you don't have to endure it. Ask them why they prefer cloth that make you misérable ? Do they enjoy seing you unhappy ? Do they try to push you to commit suicide ? What's the goal ?

Maybe if you tell them that way, calm and sincere, they could understand. But even if they don't, it's abuse and you don't have to take it
fuck them bro, if you feel you are boy, that YOU are boy, even if they say you are girl, that's not true. my parents do the same thing and i know what you feel. this is not what good parents do.
Go full slut. Ice on your nips so they definitely show up under really tight tops. Micro mini skirts that show your butt all the time- wear a swimsuit bottom under it, though. Midriff baring crop tops. Garish makeup.

Swish your hips exaggeratedly when you walk. Every so often, arch your back backwards so your boobs really stick out. Highly sexual and borderline inappropriate.

Do it enough, and they might ""force"" you to wear less revealing clothing. (Not like thats what you're ""trying"" to get them to do... XD)

Theres a debating tactic called ""reductio ad absurdum, where you take their arguments to the extreme logical conclusion to show them the absurdity of their thinking.
The exchange of information is how any systems are able to cohere. In this case, I'd try asking your mom if she likes the clothes she wears and if wearing them makes her feel good and happy. If it does, then ask her to imagine what it would feel like being forced to wear clothes that didnt make her feel as good. See what she says. Idk what your parent situation is like, but if she says something along the lines of dressing to make her significant other happy, then you should remind her to take care of herself and find something SHE really likes. 

I'm the kind of person that doesnt really get mad at others, more the systems that make them. I ALSO believe that if you could PERFECTLY comprehend the subjective experience of even someone that murders someone else, it would be hard to get MAD at them, as they were probably completely internally compelled to do what to them felt like the right thing.
Thats dumb they should let you choose how you want to dress but i guess in todays world that's just how it is
""You used to be nice, and loved me for me.""
One option is to tell them that those clothes make you uncomfortable because the way strangers look at you in them is inappropriate.
""hey Cunt, did you prefer it when I used to call you 'mom'? Yeah, we all like to be treated in a way that makes us feel respected, Cunt. I totally understand how upsetting it is when people force their desires on you.""

(people have told me i may not give the kindest advice)
As a little kid decades ago I wanted to wear a rainbow shirt because I liked all the colors and adults wouldn't let me people... you know... I might be associated with something. Ugh.

Sorry you're going through this. Upside, you'll have more freedom when you get older.
You should bring a measuring tape and just start measuring them and saying how that’s not fashionable anymore. That they have to wear clothing that makes them less comfortable or else they will be seen as pariahs with their colleagues and friends and if they don’t like that make the recommendations even worse until they get frustrated and realize that’s what they’re doing to you
If it were me, I'd dress in the most atrocious femme af drag clothes as possible until the stfu but im both a dick and an established adult so ymmv
Yeah, same thing here. My parents got mad because I bought a man's swimsuit and a swimsuit that doesn't show my thights. They got mad because I didn't wanna show MY THIGHTS and go to the pool like I was wearing just underwear. Also I've noticed that the shirts that ""fit me"" are the one that make obvious I have boobs. I fuuuucking hate it. My aunt said ""you should try to wear something with a little bit of cleavage someday. Not too much, but a little"". Oh and the ""u used to wear dresses, I miss that"" It's also really relatable. And they always use the ""you have a nice body"" thing. ""You shouldn't be ashamed"". It's not the same fucking thing I'm not ashamed because I think I'm fat I'm ashamed because I'M NOT A GIRL. I'm an enby and a minor, damn it.

You're not alone. Good luck with that pal, hope it gets better soon
This was my thought, too. Never met parents who openly support their children showing off their bodies.
And if OP manages to say it within earshot of strangers, OP's mom would actually consider what an outside observer might think about her controlling behavior.

Either she vastly improves, or she gets angry and double-down on covering up the threat to her family's public image. OP would know how their  mom is likely to react.

""I'm not a lifeless plastic doll for you to dress-up and sexualize, Mom. I respect me and my body even if you don't.""
Yeah I don’t think I’m brave enough for that lol.
True tell them it’s creepy and weird for them to do that. Wtf.
Or wear nothing but fuckin bondage for a day but that’s a bit too risky so don’t actually do that
Yes and lol to the second part
I love this comment
They gotta touch some grass for sure as well
FR tho rocks be tasty af
It’s not your fault. I am out to them but they still see me as a girl :/. (Lol to the NB part)
They are from the womens department…and it’s nyf
Its nyf. I’m moving out before 18 but I’ll still be reliant on them. I wouldn’t tell them that but yeah I’ll manage :/ thanks for the concern tho and yeah
Yeah I know but I don’t think it is. They mean well.
Thank you and I know it’s just hard sometimes
Apparently I look sloppy and messy with looser shirts and it’s not presentable. (I don’t) and thanks for the luck
I’m pretty sarcastic, I’d respond with something like pressed collared polo with trousers. Business casual, prim and proper in my book. 

JK, I hope it goes well for you! You will be ok. 😊
I’m so sorry
Kicking you out is illegal if you’re under 18
Ha I wouldn’t but yeah I get the seniment
r/insaneparents
Yeah I get it. I’ll check out the sub later maybe
Would give you a medal but im poor lol
*psssst:*

**discontent*
I wouldn’t tell Tim that. I can’t rn but I will when I’m older. Yes definitely to the last part.  Children aren’t coloring books. You can’t color them in with your favorite colors quote comes to mind
😂
Lol yeah I know
I’ve actually heard this. I’m in high school and that would just make my parents fight harder for me to be a girl
Nyf :/
That’s a good idea I didn’t think of that
Their argument is if we do that then we can keep our little girl but yes I totally agree
Yeah I know. It’s nyf it’s just frustrating
Yeah I can’t wait to move out and have some freedom but I may have to still justify my purchases to my parents. I don’t know yet
😂
I wouldn’t but I get the seNtiment
You're absolutely right. But also... even if they weren't trans, where's their personal autonomy? Not even allowed to wear 'boyish' girls clothes? Dafuq?
Yeah I know :/. They want their” little girl”
Yeah and it’s nyf
Exactly and thanks for the support. I won’t do that to my kids for sure if I have them
They are Allies for gay but idk how they feel about trans. I’m sorry about that
Yes I am and even when I move out I’m still under their reign as I depend on them financially. I get that yeah and it would be better if I didn’t get clocked 24/7 in any clothes that aren’t “masculine”. And yeah. Thanks for the faith!
Yeah that didn’t work :/
Lol and yeah I know
Phh it’s frustrating
Yeah but I’m still gonna be financially dependent but yeah visits will be limited esp after medical transition
I did that but I still can’t wear it most of the time which sucks.  They helicopter a lot…I agree with you but she just tries to ignore it most of the time. :/
Clothing in unisex. Idk how I can get one but I’m trying. And yeah I change at school sometimes. I makeshift bind and pack
I’m not going to but thanks for the sentiment
I can’t. They only buy really feminine clothes except for once I got away with androgynous ones
They would make me buy more :/
Lol and I do the change thing now
Yeah I did that when I was cis and my mom flipped on me
I am not comfortable sadly but yeah I get the sentiment
She doesn’t have any. She wears mostly dresses and “fancy” pants
Exactly. It reminds me of the quote children aren’t coloring books you can’t fill them in with your favorite colors. I totally agree
:/
It’s nyf and thank you
Say that or are you stating it?
Yep and lol. Even if I leave then which I will I’m still financially dependent on them
So they have chosen death
Lol no but lol at the same time
Didn’t work and yeah exactly
:/
Yeah
Yeah exactly
I’ve heard this but I can’t do that. I wish I was that gutsy tho.
They know actually
I’m not old enough and I will. I definitely don’t define my happiness on them, but I do love them. I just wish they accepted me as me or at least let me be
:/
It’s nyf and no I don’t know if I will ever convince them that I am truly a guy but I still have hope I will
 It’s nyf and sometimes they do dress me :/
I don’t know. That’s been an idea but I’ll be an adult soon anyways
Okay. It’s nyf and if I did that they’d just buy more girly clothes :/
Most sane Redditor (respectfully)
No…
I’m not and the fact you think that is sad
My mom forced me to wear bikinis as a kid (ftm) because I had a beautiful body and should be proud of it… fucking weirdos
Unfortunately they're not thinking of it that way.  They're trying to condition them into accepting their body.
Same, I was feeling uncomfortable reading this post thinking about OP's parents as possible sex offenders.
My parents do...my mother literally forces me to wear really short pants to show off my ""beautiful"" legs
It's even weirder than that, they don't just support it, they require it.

And if the OP is a minor, then it's not just weird, it's downright creepy.
My cousin was forced to dance, wear super tight clothes, etc... All because my aunt had, and still has, major body image issues. It was super gross because she'd be all ""oooo boys are gonna love how that makes you look"" and whatnot.

No surprise, said cousin now has body image issues. She equates her worth to how much a guy wants to sleep with her...
Love the phrasing but i Won’t say it to her
If you can stomach it,  you could try going full revealing,  I'm not sure how revealing they have  you dressing now,  but maybe if you go to the extreme it will show them how cazy they are being.  Unfortunately that might be hard on you.  Another option might be getting rid of the clothes you don't like? Or donate them/ give them to a friend? Both of those things aren't going end up being fun or even easy, but I thought I'd suggest them.  Sending lots of love!
So it’s deliberate abuse then.
If you are out to them, can you tell them that dressing that way makes you feel worse? They may think they are helping you love the body you have, but maybe they would be understanding if you told them those clothes are actually amplifying all your dysphoria.
a h, oh dear

(also can I ask what nyf means? Never heard that before)
They clearly don't. You've said you're out to them and they still see you as a girl. Nothing about that is ""meaning well"".
You always have us (the trans side of Reddit). And whatever theater kids are at your school, most likely😂
Hey OP i know how you feel. I'm in my 20s and my parents were always controlling of what I wore but it got worse when I came out to them (ftm) and it's one of the reasons I yeeted. If possible, try to get a job so you dont have to be dependent on them when you move out.
Sloppy is a subjective opinion. Simply put she is wrong.
Yea that is the problem I am 18 :(
It's there and corrected. I hate autocorrect and appreciate the help!
Well... I did say it wasn't a good idea...
Well I feel deep down you’ll make it out fine but I hope your parents turn around. If they don’t, that’s their loss. I know it’s cliche to say but it truly is. 

I know since transitioning I have been not only the best version of myself but the true version of myself. 

While in your parents care, I ask that you just take time to prioritize your self-care and mental health in any way that translates for you, personally. That’s easier said than done but I can say that being 31 and almost a year in (super delayed) transition that sometimes we have more in us than we can even imagine. 

Focus on what brings you joy; art, music, nature, pets, friends… you know what they are for you. I feel these days more than ever it can be hard to do so be kind and understanding to yourself.

Also I’d like to say I genuinely appreciate you and everything that you are. I am also FTM so I’m coming from a pretty personal place saying this

Keep doing you, bub. You got this.
When you get old enough, try and get money of your own in an account they can't watch.
Yeah
They are old fashioned?
aaaaa pleaseee
Yeah. You'll break the cycle of ignorance.
No problem! I’m sure someone else has
said this, but try to get financially independent asap. Maybe try freelance writing, or something similarly easy to hide (I assume). Good luck!
Ah, that sucks.
No bandages right?
You can ask around at a mall or clothing stores for unisex clothes, and if you can't find them there are plenty of ""Boyfriend-sized"" clothes in the women's stores (I think they're literally just men's clothes with ""Boyfriend"" tags on them.)
Maybe try stick to the least feminine ones?
Not out of your pocket right?
Oh yikes, I'm sorry
It's what you gotta answer to her.
You need to fix that. It's crazy and self-destructive for a GUY to be financially dependent on people who force HIM to wear dresses!
You can always cut your hair. They can't control that. Even if they refuse to take you to a barber, you always have scissors.
Fair enough. I got angry on your behalf.

An older female relative once pointedly gave me a bikini for my birthday in front of my friends, accompanied with a quip about accepting my femininity. I was like 11-12 and ""taking too long in the tomboy phase.""

I actually did whip around and call her a pervert right then and there. There was hell to pay, but it was worth it.
Idk if this is similar or not, but my mom gets mad when I don't wanna get changed in front of her and my grandma, because ""we all have the same parts"" and I'm ""not ugly"" so I shouldn't be insecure. 1) It's called gender dysphoria... and 2) I don't even have to be insecure to just not want to be naked in front of people.
I wanted to instinctively downvote this,  because jebus fuck that's repulsive
Dude my mom bought me A BIKINI TONGUE AND TOLD ME TO WEAR IT ""cause i have a nice body""
At that time I was like 16
Never used it but i hated so mucb how my mom used to sexualize me on my teen years
Parents can be so weird about this stuff. I know you're describing a real phenomenon, but I experienced the opposite with very Christian parents who wanted me to hate my body as sinful (regardless of gender) because of sky daddy. That made me think everyone was uncomfortable in their bodies, so I ""accepted"" mine for way too long.
I condition my kiddos into accepting their bodies by ***letting them wear whatever the fuck they want to*** as long as they're sufficiently covered and (hopefully) prepared for the weather

Once in a while they'll ask how something looks/ if it's ok. I'll point out if there's anything really glaringly 'wrong' but otherwise turn their question back on them:  How do *they* like what they've chosen? Do *they* feel good,  confident,  attractive in the clothes they're wearing? Will they be comfortable in it?

It's murkier waters now that they're teens... working out how they want to present themselves,  and what exactly qualifies as 'sufficiently covered' for the situations they'll be in

... but it has never once crossed my mind to try to force them to wear/ not wear something
They are just old fashioned
I feel so bad for your cousin, I'm sorry to hear that...
Totally valid, stay safe!
I could not lol but they’d also use that to prove their point. I have tried that but then I’m forced to buy more of that stuff or she gets mad I’m getting rid of all my “cute clothes”. Thanks for the love
Idk. They are old fashioned I think it’s just that
Maybe. I don’t know how to describe dyphoria but I could try talking to them maybe
Not your fault (not OP, just realised when reading it)
not your fault
Not your fault
I dunno. I know they love me it’s just. They don’t get that I’m not a girl I guess?
Haha yeah thanks
Yeah exactly. I’m gonna try to
Yeah ik. Her sloppy means not prim and proper
😂
Exactly and yeah I will. I will try thank you. and thank you so much that means a lot
I guess. It just seems super old fashioned to me, and I'm 38
I will try. Thank you
Nah
Yeah I know but I’m not allows to buy them
Yeah I try
No
Ah okay. I prob wouldn’t tho
Fair point. I’m not allows to get a job but I think I want to try to get one in secret when I move away
Haha I did cut my hair :)
Haha yeah :/
[deleted]
This sounds like a fun story, how did she react?
Yes and “that’s what mothers and daughters do”
It’s totally similar, it’s just freaking weird. Do what makes you feel comfortable. anyone telling you to do different might be trying to help, sure - but it almost certainly has an undertone of their inability to stop sexualising bodies.
I am not trans but never liked changing in front of others and I am a professional cyclist with a lovely body. There is a reason why we have private dressing rooms.
I was nine at best 😳😝
A lot of parents just see their kids as vessels for their own vicarious living through a second youth, unfortunately. So if mom wishes she could be young and sexy again (or for the first time if she never got a chance) she might try to force her kid to live that fantasy regardless of how uncomfortable it's making everyone else involved.
To hell with religion that crap puts people in shit situations for no reason
“Sly Daddy” 😂😂 im using that from now on. Yea I feel you though on the christian parents.
Well that's because you aren't a shitty person.
Good, I am feeling reassured now. I hope you find in yourself the strength to resist until you will be free to take your own decisions.
Sounds like the same thing to me. Old fashioned: Sex Offender. Tomato tomato lol
Thank you
Not that I’m saying that this is abuse, but being “old fashioned” does not affect whether something is abuse in any way. Beating a child with 12lb club because you’re “old fashioned” is still beating them with a 12lb club.

As the spawn of a Southern Baptist Preacher, I can assure you being “Old Fashioned” doesn’t make you abusive. But it sure as hell doesn’t excuse a shive behavior either. If you parents are behaving poorly or mistreating you (abusive or otherwise) they don’t need you to peddle excuses for them.
Ugh. Lamest excuse in the book. My (MtF) parents used to do this shit to me; ""you looked so much more handsome (🤮) with shorter hair,"" ""you should really dress up more, you look so nice in slacks/button-ups,"" etc. Not that any of these things can't look perfectly good on girls - or anyone of any identity, for that matter - they just personally didn't appeal to be even before I realised I was experiencing dysphoria. 

Whether your parents are ""old fashioned"" or not, they just want you to look the way *they* want, because you're not your own person; you're an object for their status in society. Especially if you're already out to them. This is grade-A ""I want my daughter back"" desperation. Do everything you can to fight that shit. And if all else fails, at least take solace in knowing that you'll be able to wear whatever you want as soon as you're out of their house. Hopefully sooner. They should have no power over you in that regard.
ahh, thx
thanks
thx!
If they don't love you enough to respect you, do they really love you?
Yeah lol I get it
Good. I wish you luck.
Even when they're sold in women's stores?? Dang, she's so triggered by masc clothes. /:

Maybe you can get a cis woman (friend, relative, authority figure, etc) with a roughly similar fashion taste to defend you, that you don't have to dress hyper-feminine and you should at least be allowed to have your own style detached from your gender expression (for now).

To force someone to even go against their aesthetic preferences alone can have lasting psychological damage.
Good luck!
Good on you. Don't allow them to dictate who you are.
I'm sorry your parents are being such dickheads. I think a lot of people on here are telling you but just as one more voice to add to it: *they're wrong. This is not cool of them and they are very wrong.*   


Whatever clothes you want to wear are correct and there's nothing inherently wrong or right about garments <3
What did they say
She ran off and cried lol. 

My mom was pissed though. Long lecture about being ungrateful and abusive. - ""She's just trying to help you accept yourself!""
There are no words to describe how uncomfortable I would feel getting undressed with *anyone* in the room at that age, let alone *my mom.*
im all for body positivity, but that also means looking good for ourselves, what was she thinking? most parents would be happy their kid WASN'T wearing bikinis in elementary school!
Thank you
Yeah I guess and idk I don’t know if they are doing what they do on purpose  well I mean knowing it hurts
Me.
I mean. Yes. They do
Thank you
Yeah I know. She likes me to wear traditional women clothes as “I am her little girl” and as a result anything masculine is a no. I’ve been able to get androgynous clothes one time but I’m not allowed to wear them to school 9/10 times. I got secret boy clothes but they aren’t at my house
Thank you exactly and yeah
I wanna know too.
Nothing worth repeating, just some one being a total jerk.
Yeah same. Trans or cis. Even when I was cis I hated people seeing my body, esp since I have certain things on my body
Yeah exactly, the kid should be choosing what’s comfortable and appealing to them - not encouraged to wear something because of an adult’s visual preference, which is almost certainly inherently sexual/sexualising the child 🤢
Theyre adults, they can have some damn agency for their actions

They can absolutely be working harder to fight their biases and understand you, but they arent

Theyre failing you as parents, and they deserve to be blamed for that. You cant excuse them and say ""they dont know any better"" because you are *giving them the opportunity to know better, and theyre refusing it.*

Thats their concious decision to be shitty to you. Dont excuse it. It hurts, it sucks, but you need to accept that theyre to blame.
Consider why you're afraid to tell them any of the things you've responded to with ""I wouldn't tell them that but..."" Why are you afraid? I'm betting the answer is you know their love is conditional, which is then simply not love.
I still wear long sleeves even in summer (granted I try to keep the material thin and the sleeves rolled up mostly.)

I had some family members who openly mocked me and wanted to know why I was being so dumb as to wear sleeves in 90 degrees.

I didn’t say “because I feel really fucking uncomfortable in public and covering myself up makes me feel better and more secure”. I didn’t say anything, because I knew how it would work out.
I guess your right. It’s just hard to accept that for me. Idk.
I am having trouble coming up with a response to this… I mean. I’m afraid they’ll hate me or stop loving me if I show proof I disobey them or question them bc they have kept me under such a tight leash I’m afraid to make them mad at me or that they’ll go thru my stuff or obsessively question me about every little thing. I mean my mom found a pride flag in my room and managed to come up with 20 questions, some of them repeated, in an accusing tone
If anyone asks you this, maybe say it’s to avoid sunburn. Could get you out of trouble maybe
That makes sense
Best of luck, hon. I really hope they come around and you can have a healthy relationship with them, but my bets are on you realizing they don't care enough to provide that, and I know that's hard, but the sooner you're able to move on and surround yourself with people who will actually support you, the better.
Thank you and yeah me too. That is hard and a good point. I’ll just see what happens until I can move out and make my decision. Thanks"	wurr1q	trans	1967	0.95	2022-08-22 12:02:00
I bought my first set of girl clothes at goodwill for $85!!!!		"I've got one near me I've been wanting to buy clothes from. I'm still just super nervous about buying clothes in public.
Isn’t Goodwill freakin awesome?! I’ve got so many cute dresses from there.
Damn that's cheap, I used $100 for a pair of Jeans, leggings and a sports bra. I wish I could have gotten more, but I didn't wanna spend a ton of money.
""It can't be that easy."" 

\*spends 90 bucks on some awesome goodwill clothes\*

""It's that easy.""
Congrats! Looks like you got some cute stuff
Okay miss thing!! These are so cute? The second from the left is my favourite!
WE HAVE THE SAME SHIRT WITH LINES OMG 😭😭😭😂
I did the same thing about a week ago! Got 4 shirts, 2 skirts and a cute tube top. Never felt so cute!
Yayyy 

congrats :3
Hopefully you will model them for us one day
Thats awesome! I love the goodwill. Congrats on your finds.
Oh nice I gotta remember to hit up some places for clothes
Hit up Savers next. They have a huge selection. My closet if filled with cashmere all from Savers and Goodwill.
What a steal! Plaid is a such a good choice, too. I’m a big fan of its stylistic flexibility.
Exciting stuff!
Great Job!  Enjoy 🎉
Thift shopping is AMAZING!!! I went shopping for my first sets back in April, and for ≈$110 I got 3 tops, 3 jeans, 2 dresses, 2 bras, a sunhat, house sandles, two purses, and a pair of bracelets.

That doesn't stop me from wanting those amazing expensive outfits online
Lovely skirt!
I tried to post some close ups of the clothes but reddit said no :(
Managed to post the close ups [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/x9xki6/an_update_to_the_post_i_made_last_night_a_close/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)

These are so cute! I need to go to goodwill more often
that skirt is so cute!
Honestly I'm the same way, until a friend of mine said ""you known they aren't paid enough to give a shit, and the customers are more worried about themselves."" I live in deep red georgia, and the only girl who talked to me asked if I wanted to look at some of the items she would have to put back.
Also no one wants to be that person to go up to someone and say ""eXcUsE mE tHe MeN's SeCtIoN iS oVeR tHeRe"" and then get hit with ""I'm buying clothes for my terminally ill girlfriend"" like can you imagine? Anytime I see a girl in the men's section I'm just like okay whatever as I pay zero attention to other people, and now I just assume it's the same for everyone
I wish I could pull of dress! Unfortunately I don't pass nearly well enough to pull them off just yet... hopefully soon though
Goodwill or thrift stores are a godsend for all of transkind
So much cheaper here in Thailand! I went to a store called happy land and got skirts for $2-3 each 😍😍😍
Yeah it's the best, I spent like an hour and a half finding the perfect clothes
Do you mind telling me in the x,y graph format? Like is it 2,4 3,2 etc? I want to make sure I know which kne you are talking about
Thank you!
Maybe...when the E kicks in and my hair grows out more
They are very soft and feel great 😍
That's true. Unfortunately, for right now I don't have enough money to buy anything expensive 🙃
Thanks I'm excited to wear them
Oh yeah, and no one cares you are looking at or buying women's clothes. I've bought tons of clothes in drab and I've never even got a cross eyed look. I admit that it's super scary at first, but I don't even think about it any more. (BTW, I'm 21 months into my journey at age 57!)
I recently took a job at Goodwill and am in north Georgia. I can confirm. The pay ain't enough to care about what a person is doing even if they are stealing or setting the store on fire. And customers care so little about others they'll leave clothes on the floor.
Yeah but I feel like a complete creep if I'm not passing and I'm in the women's section
Well I am late to the party but yea there is always the: ""These are for my sick sister"" Or whoever comes to mind :p
Gotta say that I am guilty of doing this at least once haha
You don’t have to pass to wear a dress. Wear what makes you happy! I love wearing dresses and some heels. Granted I’m 6’2” without heels and like 6’6” with heels on lol, but I don’t care!
Sadly doesn't exist in Europe 😭
row/column; 1,2 and 2,2 together :)
np 

they look so cute and are gonna look so good on you :\]
May I ask where in North georgia? We may be close to each other👀
I literally don't pass at all, I started E less than two weeks ago, and had all my hair shaved off in March. I felt the same way before I went shopping for the first time, and here is my advice:

Step 1: Outside of the girl clothes section take three deep breaths and on the third walk to the nearest rack of girl clothes

Step 2: Stop and look down at the rack, don't move or browse just wait there for about thirty seconds. After thirty seconds starting looking at each piece of clothing slowly ine at a time front and back. DO NOT RUSH

Step 3: After you finish with that rack slowly move to the next and begin slowly looking over the other items. Don't look at anyone else, just keep looking over the items one at a time.

Step 4: If you're not comfortable trying on the clothes, just find a couple that you like and then leave, even if it is only two or three on your first trip, the important thing is the experience and realizing that no one cares.

This is exactly what I did on my first trip to walmart to buy a skirt. I ended up buying a skirt, shirt and shorts, and on the next trip I worked up the courage to use the changing rooms. Now, I spent an hour looking for girl clothes at goodwill and shopped at Victoria secret for panties, because again for the people in the back NO ONE CARES
It's sort of a mental thing, I want to look good for the first time I wear a dress. I also want to exercise and get a bigger booty before as well
I think they might call them charity shops in Europe
They are very pretty, I'm so excited to wear them!!!
Yeah now I just need to work up the courage to wear them outside. Maybe when I go to vist a bluer part of the state (georgia) I will, but until then I'm just going to lay in bed wearing my skirt and pantyhose
The store I work at is in Hiram, I'm not too far from there though.
I’m in Marietta
I'm in rossville
thank you for this!  it's exactly what I need to hear and remember.
Fair enough. Do what makes YOU happy.
Never heard of them. Sorry.  
We have stores that sell used clothing, perhaps that's what yours was?  
Or am I wrong?
Yeah you will get the courage eventually :\]
Yes it's a used clothes stores, maybe just called something else lol
We actually just call them used clothing stores 😂"	x9cy0e	trans	1920	0.99	2022-09-08 21:52:21
Do cis women just randomly compliment other women they see in public?	After socially transitioning, I occasionally get random women on the street I don’t know complementing my nails or cloths. Is this a thing women do to each other?? It honestly kinda blew my mind when it first happened lol. Made my brain go “do they actually like this skirt or are they clocking me as trans and trying to be nice?” Lol	"Yep they do! I’m ftm, and it took me some time to adjust to the fact that dudes do not do this lol. 9/10 times guys look at me like I’m insane if I compliment them on anything, but it was a totally normal thing to do when I presented as a woman.
Sometimes.  Usually about something specific, like 'I like your nails/hair/skirt/top/etc...'  

Never something like 'nice ass'
Yes. Women compliment each other all the time, hair, nails, clothes, jewelry, if they like it they'll tell you, and it's a good habit to break yourself as well, I usually compliment whatever is triggering my envy, if it's her long thick full hair while I have thinning hair with a deep masculine widows peak that geys dysphoric, I compliment her hair then. It's very normal.

I suspect, the reason men don't is because men complimenting women is often or almost always an initiation to flirt, which is a move to fuck. It's a constant assault of men trying to bed them. So, they dont initiative with men, and ecen men complimenting other men have rules of engagement for how and what so it's not ""gay"" again because telling someone they look nice is an opening to flirting, to fucking.

That's my experience at least.
They actually do this.  I had a lady at a story compliment me, and then ask if I liked rocks, then stopped her register to show me pictures on her phone of the cool weird quarts rocks she's been finding in her yard under this old barn.

It totally caught me off guard and was 100% awesome <3     I'm still finding the bravery to compliment others but I sneak it in there some.  Small talk is HARD
I’m trying to learn this, I have a huge problem assuming complements are actually mockery at worse or disingenuous at best. Yaaaa trauma
I am not out yet, but have been known to complement nails/hair/shoes/well coordinated outfit.  I have always justified it as I do not typically notice people due to my impaired vision, so if they stick out I want to say something...usually get a smile.

I do get compliments on my hair and nails on occasion (again, not out, but soon).
Alright ftm here. There’s a really easy way to compliment women without coming off weird. 

Go for things they can change: make up, hair style, clothes. 
Avoid things they can: body parts or anything like that.  Sometimes eyes are acceptable. 

Other than that use words that are softer and cuter like “oh my god you’re eyes are lovely!” Is absolutely a safe one. Also if you go for specific things about clothing: “I love the color of that shirt on you”. 

It doesn’t come across sexual and picking up on small details of things they choose shows you’re looking at it from a fashion perspective and not a sex perspective.
I’m AFAB non-binary and I still do this. I see someone who looks nice and I’m like “they probably put a lot of effort into that outfit I need to compliment them” I still do the same even after I’ve come out and non-binary
Yep! It's a super normal thing. I'm ftm and socially transitioned. I'll compliment women on their nails and outfits all of the time. Plus I'm used to my guy friends doing it too. Might just be a culture thing around here but I know that women always love to compliment each other.
A woman's way of showing another woman she's friendly is through a compliment. Think of it as the equivalent of the nod a guy might give to another guy he doesn't know.
Yes, but it's also because you're probably taking better care of yourself now. I've been in situations where I'm in boymode and I'm still getting compliments at a noticeable clip because of my hair or shoes or whatever. Girls will notice if you take care in your appearance.
Back when I presented male I used to get compliments from dudes all the time on my clothes or fashion….is my gaydar broken ?
Nope, not clocking you, welcome to the girl club.  It's great and affirming!
This is absolutely something they do, Just look at any girls Instagram it's constant compliments from their girls friends, my sister is cis and she randomly compliments me (I'm ftm but in the closet) I've obversed women constantly complimenting women it's just a nice thing they do :)
im a cis woman and im always complimenting other women. i tell girls when i like their hair, make up, clothes etc. always random interactions. i just think if i think she looks good.. tell her! maybe it will brighten her day. it surely would brighten mine. us girls gotta stick together!
I'm Italian and often I randomly get compliments from cis women and so do I.... It's a social thing in our own culture... Complimenting is a beautiful thing enjoy it!❤️
Feminine afab nonbinary here, and I can say that yes, women do this for each other a lot
Yup.  Though I did have that happen pretransition, too.
Yes... It's a woman thing ♀️
Yeah my twin does it all the time and as someone who is very shy it scares me lol
I’ve only ever seen it happen in the states when I’ve been there with my sister (mind, I’ve not travelled much- I’m from the UK and live in Spain and besides the states I’ve visited Ireland, France, Cyprus, and Thailand). If you’re talking to someone you don’t know (e.g. a cashier) then they might compliment you if they’re particularly friendly, but random people on the street? Generally not, no. It happened A LOT to my sister in the states though- easily a couple times a week
Yes.
Yeah that happens
This happened to me about a month ago, and I thought it was cause this woman clocked me...
Since I started passing it happens every day. So now I do it too
Yep, I do this all the time. Just to try and brighten someone’s day!
Yeah it's pretty common. I'm a little nervous about because being more masc look wise cause some people said it might be seen as creepy to compliment women and having gone through weirdos being creepy at work, I don't want anyone else to feel that way if I decide to have a more masculine appearance.
 I am enby who likes fashion and cute stuff so I can't be completely mistaken as a guy but it'd be hard to unlearn complementing some people's good outfits/accessories and stuff tbh
Yep! Women randomly compliment each other all the time, it makes me a bit sad that cis men don't do this.
This just happened to me several times last 
weekend at a music festival. I got compliments on my outfit, nails and makeup on different days. I initially thought they were clocking me but my friend told me that I should take that as a W and not think about it. I did feel confident with my outfit and nails 💅
Still my favorite so far is ""I like the way you walk! It's like you're owning the sidewalk!"" And I think about that often.

But yes, yes they do.
Cisf here. *Maybe* once every 3 months when I see another chick, I compliment them. Last week I saw a woman with the brightest pink hair, and told her it was such a beautiful color. I compliment men, too, though, probably just as frequently, if not more. All my close friends are men, so yeah.
Yeah! It’s something I don’t often see cis men do, but I see cis lasses do it all the time, and do it to me too! It’s just a thing. :) don’t sweat it
i get this sometimes, not on the street but in socially appropriate situations. my best tip is to not just look for something to compliment but if you genuinely love something you should mention it! i sometimes feel a strong compulsion to acknowledge various things i love if they strike me just right and it's always appreciated! the way you follow up the conversation flows so naturally if you actually like the item you're complimenting! questions i would ask are where they got it, if it's special, was it on sale, or really whatever the item is just whatever struck me about it i will typically ask. so if somebody compliments an item you have, it's polite and useful to mention how you came to have the item! bonus points if it's a neat story you can tell in a sentence or so. you can also share a gripe about the item! if somebody complimented my shoes i would be sure to mention how hard it was to find something i liked in my size, lol

in short just share your enthusiasm and why you love it, either if you're complementing or being complemented. good luck in the world sister! ;)
Often times. I am a trans man but get complimented a lot by girls and women at my school. Women and enby people are more likely to compliment in my experience. Sometimes they genuinely think you look good and sometimes they just want to make you feel good. It’s the best tbh
Yes especially if they are drunk, then it goes like “omg I love your entire outfit like youre cool lets be friends!” In the bathroom at a bar and then you go on drunken girl adventures with strangers that involve going to eat and anything shiny. Lmao, girls are very friendly with each other and we all appreciate the effort it takes to look good. Like we know how much things cost like makeup or clothes. So, we support our fellow women and tell them they look great. 

I sometimes do it for guy friends but never to a stanger because we never know who will take it the wrong way. But other women know that fear so we don’t worry about it when we talk to thwm
Yup. All the time.
Quite often. Me and other women complement each other quite often. It took some getting used too.
Yep! It’s quite common :)
I love complimenting women on great outfits and the like, but when you're male presenting this can be interpreted as something dishonest. Creepy men made it this way. It was a big moment for me when I could finally remark on a co-worker's amazing hair. I just privately admired it for 2 years. Amazing woman actually, one of my best allies and now a close friend.
Yeah they do that a lot. I'm ftm & used to get it all the time - ""honey I just had to say I love your hair, it's so pretty *pets my hair* "" , ""honey you're so beautiful, don't you go letting any boy treat you badly, you can get any you want with a face like that"" , ""sweetie your outfit is so gorgeous, I just had to tell you"" etc etc etc.... it's normal for them, don't worry about it :)
Oh yeah they just are like that.  Even before I came out as trans I was getting compliments on my blue hair and my painted nails.
Hi ftm here, while i didn't received compliments in my country unless it was a friend or someone i knew, but when i went to america a lady started complimenting my hair colour in the airport randomly. so maybe it is a common thing in America.
Yeah. I've gotten mostly compliments on hair and nails, but some about a shirt or skirt as well. It's nice. I find myself complimenting other women, too. It makes me feel good to hear it, so I want to spread that feeling to others. 

Rarely ever had a guy compliment me in the before time. Maybe if we had the same shirt on or something, or they thought my necklace was cool, but that's about it.
Yassss. Gotta build a sister up when you can! It’s good to put a bit of kindness into the world when you can, and it costs nothing :) Number 1 compliment is a dress with pockets!!!
Meanwhile you got me before i knew i was trans complimenting anyone i thought had something cute och good looking on or with them 🤣 i’d see a woman with cute hair or a skirt i’d compliment it sure some of them thought i was a creep which with how the world is looking i dont judge xD but it was the same with me for guys compliment thier hair, beard och clothes
I've always complimented other women on their outfits, makeup, or if their hairstyle is particularly cute!!
This is something I LOVE when I was forced to live as a man I wanted so bad to compliment a girl when I see something I just really like like her nails being awesome or shoes or clothes in fact I actually had some dysphoria moments from not being able to do that now I'm living as a woman full time I get to not only do that but I get them alot myself makes me so happy I had my ankle boots complimented yesterday and today I'm going to purple dress and me and a random woman we actually had a discussion about purple being both our fav colors that started from a compliment
As a cis woman (I joined this subreddit bc my partner is trans:)) yes! I love complimenting other women. And I always mean it. So many beautiful people.
Yep! And honestly the more compliments going around the better so spread the love!
It happens to me all the time too so it’s a phenomenon that I am absolutely here for
I don’t present VERY femme, tank top with jeans (the hormones have done their magic though and the girls aren’t huge but they are visible especially with no bra) but i pulled my hair back in a way i thought was cute and a woman at the grocery store told me she really liked it. That was saturday and i’m still grinning ear to ear!
Not in the street but in bars or bathrooms or at school/work yeah
It blows my mind that men are less inclined to share complements with each other.  It stands to reason if they aren’t socialized to do this, but I was raised in a primarily female context where we would support each other’s feelings.
Yes all the time. Try it out yourself in social interactions with anyone you come across try and find something to compliment
Ahhhh yes omg haha other girls are so nice 🌼! After coming out I've certainly noticed a big increase in women(and people in general) complimenting or initiating conversation. I've made a couple really wonderful friends from just asking someone where they got their jeans or whatever haha ☺️

I've even made a couple wonderful friends just by asking for advice in makeup and such 💖
Yeah, my sister compliments random women all the time. Like we will be eating at a restaurant or something and she will just compliment the waiter or someone sitting nearby, completely out of the blue. It’s like a whole different world then when I thought I was a cis man, I actively want people to complement me because when they do it makes my day.
Yes lol ♡
Still not used to it, I basically “deer in the headlights” for a second or 2 before getting out a response.
Yes. 

Despite the stereotype of women being bitchy and competitive with each other, women compliment each other all the time, usually about clothes, shoes, or makeup. Honestly it's super nice and has made me compliment more women.
totally normal! i love giving random compliments, but only if the other person has good vibes. the best response is, “oh thank you!” if it’s in passing or i’ll give a small detail if it’s like at check out in a shop or something. like, “thank you!! it’s new! got it at h&m.”

edit: if you want to be a little flirty or extra nice I always say “i was thinking the same about you! love that jacket” or compliment something else on their outfit. only if you mean it though. a sincere thank you is better than a forced compliment. typing this out makes it seem so much more complicated than it is lol
Ofc we do. If I see a bad a55 bish I gotta let her know.
Funny thing some random girl complemented my friend on how pretty she is not that long ago. At this point imma just say yes
Yup, I'm a (prospective? for want of a better word) MtF and I notice this alllllll the time. Women always compliment each other, and men almost never do. Probably something to do with being seen as gay I guess...
A person complimenting someone of the opposite sex also seems to be seen as flirting too, which is frustrating when I just want to admire a girl's cute skirt or boots (usually I'm jealous). I have to do the admiring from a distance and just tell my girlfriend about it when I see her next in private.
yes, they do. its like that one scene in on my block. its v@gifi
Afab here! I am too shy to compliment people, but of I wasn't, I would compliment so many girls on their looks. I mostly get complimented about my style and sometimes my hair. Definitely still bad at receiving compliments😅
yep, im afab, not cis (im genderqueer) but compliment people with cool hair or makeup or whatever if i see them, regardless of gender! :] i just think we need to spread more positivity, i don't try and harass or chat to these people (but we can chat if they want to!) i just do it because it makes others happy and it makes me happy to be nice :] so to answer your question, i do and alot of cis and trans women ik do
Possibly depends on the culture. I'm FTM and never got that when I presented female but I'm from the UK and we tend to just.... not talk to random people.
Women are very much affectionate with each other its a normal thing
Yes, absolutely! I am a cis girl and when I see a woman who has a beautiful dress or beautiful hair, maybe a hair color that I love or a style that I appreciate, very very often I compliment her, even if I do not know her, because it is something that makes me feel good and I think it pleases (I love when I receive compliments about my style). It is best to avoid compliments about body parts, whether they are eyes, legs etc, because it might seem strange. the rest is ok!
yes. I'm afab and women compliment me a lot and I sometimes compliment women too.
I do it quite often, tbh.  I do it if I genuinely like something they're wearing or their nails or whatever.  Women don't lift each other up enough, generally speaking.  Many times, they're surprised by it (which is sad, honestly).  We all need to be more kind to each other.
Yes all the time 😊😊
yes! AFAB here. I am gonna miss this as I transition. Cis women give out nice compliments about clothes, hair, and makeup all the time on the street. Also, it is an inviolable rule that if you are drunk and meet another woman in a bathroom at a bar, you must tell each other how beautiful and great you are and become best friends. Then you tell each other how much you are going to kill it out there and then you part ways with great mutual love and support.
Yeah they do and I honestly love it when they do that to me cuz it means I pass enough! I get compliments all the time on my outfit or nails, hell I do the same thing to other girls I may see. It's kinda like an instinct now
Bestie I do this all the time, I'd say a fair 80% (at least) of the random compliments you receive are gonna be absolutely genuine
Im cis male and I wanna get compliments too!
I'd say so! im ftm and used to get a lot of compliments on my hair.
I was walking my dog once and a neighbor stops me and tells me how beautiful I am. I thank her and proceed to keep walking at which point she asks me ""arent I beautiful too"". Omfg yes I respond!!!!!!!!   True story
Personally I think that when women notice that I'm trans they give me compliments a little easier because maybe they want to be supportive.
Yes as somone who presents as a cis female it is very true. Women often randomly compliment each other so do I to other women it is nice and sincere usually. When I see somone looking nice I can't stop myself from saying something nice about it.
Yeah, I'm still not used to it, so I stammer and say thanks. My wife usually then adds that I made it, as most of the time it's things I've made that get the most compliments. If not then it's bound to be one of my Gorjuss bags 😜
Yes!

I am enby and do it to anyone, not just women :)
yea, but usually when i get complimented my gay-dar also goes off.
yea, but usually when i get complimented my gay-dar goes off.
Yes
One day, out with my wife, I got a compliment on my makeup...not gonna lie, I was super elated as I had been trying to perfect the smokey look for a long time at that point. Then later got a compliment on my blouse. 

My wife considered it very normal and was incredibly happy for me because they boosted my esteem quite a bit.

It's normal. Eat the compliments up and appreciate being appreciated.
I yearn for the day I get a random compliment on the street. It will trurly mean that I have finallly become a woman
I’m a cis girl and yeah, absolutely. I make sure to compliment people if I can. Not in a cat-call way, more like “your hair looks great!” or “you are rocking that outfit!”
I'm mtf but I boy mode at work in a grocery store. I get compliments from women all the time there about my hair. It's long and bright blue at the moment. I'm still getting used to all the compliments and smiles. I've had a few customers call me ma'am and that really surprised me.
One of my friends who is a cis woman (but eggy) ALWAYS compliments at least one woman on something whenever we go into a business. We go to the grocery store? She compliments the cashier on her jewelry. Go to the bar later? She compliments the bar tender’s nails. At least one compliment per location because she wants to make it a habit to lift women up. Love to see it!
Yep! It’s something that I see happen between my mom and sisters a lot in public. (I’m ftm but as a kid I never understood it)
I tried complementing one of the guys in my class by calling him cute and I ended up receiving death threats from one of his friends gfs (he's single and straight btw)
Yep that’s absolutely a thing. If I see something about another woman that I find to be attractive or pretty I tell them!
Yep. Before I came out I would just randomly shout at other girls that I loved their hair or something they were wearing. Had a lot of girls randomly compliment my hair or my bag covered in pins over the years
do cis guys not do that? that's kinda sad
Yes, they do. And they do it in a lot of different ways too. Most of the time, they're just being friendly. They genuinely like what you're wearing or they think you're cool.

There is also a passive-aggressive version of it that super privileged women engage in. But who cares what those people think, right? 

A lot of women are really friendly to other women. You can compliment random women on their clothes, hair, nails, etc, and it's seen as a positive thing.
100%

I compliment anyone that is wearing something I think is pretty/cute/cool whatever. I do the same with makeup and hair styles. I go by the moto, if I like it, I should let them know. I do this with men as well. But… I’m cautious because it get mistaken as flirting. Often.
It very much is a thing women do. I've experienced it, and even done it! It may take some getting used to, but embrace it.
Cis women do indeed compliment each other's clothes, shoes, nail, hair. I mean, we've all seen mean girls use it to put a person down, but based on tone of voice, I'd take it as the compliment it was intended.
Oh definitely! I’m bisexual afab non-binary and find that it’s much easier to compliment random women than men. And yes, it’s very often nails, hair, and clothing. I do compliment men as well, but seemingly less often. But I’ve always randomly complimented women!
yeah lmao, I'm ftm and I'm kinda worried that when I transition I won't be able to do it without feeling creepy
Cis woman here - From my experience: yes, women absolutely compliment one another randomly. 

I see a lady waering a marvelous dress - I tell her ""excuse me for interrupting your day, you look amazing, I just had to say!""
I also had that happening to me few times when other ladies gave me compliment on how I dress or my cool nail etc.

I doubt any of the ones that compliment you were trying to clock you. They probably wanted to let you know you look great and that your style is a candy for the eyes :)
My non-trans female (or possibly NB woman) perspective: I'm going to break this down because autism & social cues have been difficult for me h many trans women have told me this advice was helpful.

Sometimes it can be either of the two possible reasons you mentioned, OP, but try not to get a complex about it because the compliments are coming from a girl or woman (who does not want to make you uncomfortable) who is telling you, ""I see you as amazing today & I love it when other women compliment me so I will compliment you.""

This is similar to ""the nod"" I have seen men do when they acknowledge each other & wish to communicate respect/acceptance while passing each other anywhere or when sharing a space together.

Either possibility (whether you're perceived as cis or trans) communicates two possible but similar possibilities:

1. you've been perceived as cis + non-threatening (and worthy of a compliment because they genuinely like an aspect of your appearance)

...or, maybe... 

2. you've been perceived as not-a-man or as a trans woman + non-threatening (and worthy of a compliment because they genuinely like an aspect of your appearance).

Either way, whoever does it isn't treating/seeing you like a man & generally the compliments are genuine so try to enjoy them.  Also, it's considered polite to either say ""OMG thank you so much"", or to say something similar plus a return compliment about something that stands out about them.
yes!!! I love giving compliments to other ladies out and about, and I've gotten compliments too!! its usually about clothes, makeup, hair, that kind of thing. stuff the person chooses.
Completely normal! I’m AFAB non-binary but I’ve always loved complimenting people! Thank you is a good response! Sometimes people will compliment you in return, but I wouldn’t expect that 😊 hope this helps!
I do its normal for me. I can appreciate another womans effort i to her look or lifestyle
i think so! i’m a trans girl but i do this all the time and get compliments too. i used to do it even before i figured my gender out, but idk how i came off back then 😅
Cis woman here. Yes, we compliment each other all the time and yes those compliments are genuine. Women supporting women! So welcome to the club, we have jackets…which will will compliment you on.
(Oh yeah, we compliment each other pretty freely (usually) without issue. It is all good fun 99.9% of the time. I’m a cis-female for context and I’m fairly butchy looking most of the time but I still get little compliments and the ones I give to others are accepted as normal as well. 

I wouldn’t worry about it and would actually encourage you to let them feel nice just like any normal compliments!
Have been out for over a year now, I still feel like they're clocking me and just trying to be nice to show that they ""accept my lifestyle"" and/or to feel better about themselves, but supposedly this is a normal thing women do with other women. It's taken a LOT of adjusting. Try not to read into it too much, and just take the compliments at face value. <3
I don't know if it's just my little social man bubble but my guy friends and I complement each other all the time. We are gay though, so...

It is equal parts ""Nice nails, where did you get them done?"", ""Wow, those pants make your bulge look great."" and ""I like what you are doing with your beard. Are you using product?""
Never happened to me while I was still female-presenting, but it’s happened to a lot of my cis women friends while we’ve been out together. It’s definitely common!
I went to artschool, graduated into an art career, and my life is surrounded by other artists.  I can say that within the field of arts, this is a thing that happens regardless of gender, guy to guy, girl to guy, guy to girl, girl to girl etc.

&#x200B;

but I have noticed that now that I'm going out in public more presenting female, that this is a thing that just happens all the time with complete strangers now.
Yup. This is totally a thing. We do it all the time. Build each other up honey.
Gosh yes! I love complimenting other women and I love being complimented! It is very “normal” for cis women. I can totally understand why you have those thoughts though❤️
Yes! I'm ftm and I found it difficult to learn that men are in fact, not the same, I've gotten some good feedback from giving compliments, but also a lot of negative feedback. 🥲
YES and it's a thing that should absolutely me normalized, it's so awful that just like complimenting people or saying hi and stuff whether or not you know them. It seriously makes people's day just to hear something nice and it should be normalized !
Yeah pretty much lol
Yessss, a girl in my university told that my shoes were pretty, I was flattered
Women care about how they look and we know how insecure we can be. Me I try to give compliments like that because women need to hear it.
Yes!!!! I love it ☺️☺️
I do!  Love making someones day. I don't care who you are, how you identify, I'll find something to love at first sight and tell you, and expect nothing in return because your happy makes me happy.
I have gone so far out of my way to compliment another woman.  We all suffer from insecurity as females.  I don't think any of us are 100% sure we're looking good when we go out into the world's.  So when i see a bitch looking fierce or rocking the absolute hell out of something. I tell her!!
Kinda weird you’re wearing cloths though, like a dish cloth?
Yes. We're all sisters, some are still bitches but those you just ignore cause they existence are irrelevant
You can compliment back or BOnUs POInTS 
Ask for their tips!!
Yes, some of us go out of our way because we figure giving a small compliment can help us forget how crapy we feel some days.
All the time lmao
Cis woman here. We do compliment each other randomly, for a few reasons:

1) Because we really like a person and their look and want to cheer them on

2) Because we are jealous of their look (I've seen it many times)

3) Because we want to be friendly, even if it isn't honest. (I can't pretend that this doesn't happen; some people just aren't genuine.)


The important thing is learning to take the words at face value and not worrying about the intent. Even if someone hits you with a sarcastic compliment, take it literally and smile. It's a power move and it feels great.
Of course! It's quite common so don't worry.
(I’m a cis F22) yes I do! I like to compliment other people. I feel like it’s also a sign to be like *im nice* if someone looks skeptical of me I be like **I love your nails**. Or I’ll just want them to feel happy and pretty so I’ll say something. It’s a normal thing!!! :)
If you live in the Midwest or the South the correct way to respond to a compliment on an article of clothing is to immediately respond with the name of the store and the discount you received on said article of clothing.  Example: “Nice shirt!”  “O why thank you I found this in the clearance section in the back left corner of Kohls and used my Kohls cash so in the end I got this for $8.00”.
Yep! Super common. Get used to more compliments coming your way.

People need their hard work to go out in the world acknowledged. It’s just polite.
yes ! they're being genuine too dw, cis women won't usually compliment others unless they are serious
yep!! even in the bathroom its normal and common to compliment another woman, so dont feel too self conscious! 🙌🏾
Cis f here and yes whenever I see something I like about a girl I compliment her certain accessories, hairs, shoes , eyes, personality i've even complimented boys before It was really funny actually I blurted out how much I liked his eyes! lol i'm weird
Yeah it’s totally a thing. You’ll get it more in like… southern or hospitality focused areas, but yeah in my experience as a femme presenting (afab) non-binary person, it’s completely normal.
As a transmasc, this is normal! It’s usually about stuff like your clothes, hair, nails, shoes, etc. 

It’s usually expected to respond with “Thanks!” and maybe give extra details on where you got the clothes/haircut/nail polish, especially if the clothes have POCKETS
Some women definitely do randomly compliment. And LGBTQ+ people who clock you also compliment. :)
Well normal people do that quite often
I think it’s just cis people me (mtf) have been approached by many cis people complimenting my hair because it is very nice and thick but like everyone but mostly cis females
Not a cis woman, but afab and I generally compliment people when I see things on them that l like. I also had people of all kinds of genders compliment me before, but there is a tendency for those people to be fem, female, looking female associated or something alike
Almost four years in and I can count on one hand the number of times I have been out and NOT been complimented on what I am waring, 99% of the time it is women. (I never go out without looking my best. I really love fashion and do my utmost to always look good) I assumed this was the norm for women and it was confirmed when I started noticing that sometimes I could clock them clocking me after they had already complimented me. It never went bad, just that either they would redouble/expand their compliments or simply look a little weirded out.
yes they do!! tbh i think everyone should but cis women usually are most likely to do it
Yes they do.
Yes, they do, and I love it!  


I can now tell the difference between when a cis woman is offering me a sincere compliment and when she's reacting awkwardly to having clocked me. For example, one day I bought a pair of gloves when I had just gotten a manicure. The clerk didn't just compliment my nails, though: She called them ""fish"". White cis woman appropriate AAVE / drag (ballroom) slang = she is trying way too hard to prove that she's ""down"".
Lol that’s wild! We’re kinda going though the opposite experiences haha. What’s like… the proper way to respond? Both time I just kinda said “oh thanks!” And moved along 😅 is that sort of how it goes or is it polite to compliment them back?
Back when I presented as male I only had one guy ever tell me ""hey, nice shirt""

And you've guessed it: he was wearing the exact same shirt
I'm MTF. Men do this, too, but it's not direct. They'll say, ""Bro, how much did those kicks cost?"", ""Really? Worth.""

A woman would just say, ""Oh, I do like your shoes, they're so pretty!""

Men: ""I was looking at reviews about that, what are your thoughts about it?""

Women: ""Wow, that looks so great on you!""
I complimented a guy once, before I ever started questioning my gender.  He happened to be gay and saw it as an advance.  I quickly explained I only meant it as a compliment, and things were fine afterwards, but I occasionally feel bad about leading him on like that.
Saaaammmmeeee 
I'm still getting used to not saying ""omg I love your hair, what do you use in it"" or ""hey cool jeans""..... it feels so weird not saying/ hearing that stuff now.
I’m not a ftm I’m mtf but I try to do this to men as much as possible when they’re not looking at me funny or clearly a threat, they always seem to get something out of just a simple “that’s a cool shirt man!” Or “I like your sneakers!” Because of how starved they are for it lol there’s always a dude with a cool hat or shoes around so it’s not too hard
Omg it took me so long to figure out why women would look at me weird when I complemented them, after transitioning ftm, and then I realized they think I’m being creepy/hitting on them. 

Totally normal for women to other women
Dudes need to compliment each other more
It's hard not to do, like when a guy actually puts together a good outfit for once I want to compliment it so they know they did good lol
Yesssss, I wish it was normalised for guys to compliment other guys without it being weird, creepy or 'gay'
They probably think you’re hitting on them. So be careful you’re not too nice.
When I thought I was a man I would do this on occasion when I thought another dude was killing it or was wearing something cool. In most cases my experience was the reaction was generally a little taken aback at first, but otherwise positive. Granted, I would definitely pick and choose people I thought it was safe to do with. Someone rocking a cool hairdo? Definitely say something. Or if they're wearing a slick as fuck belt or something turn it into a 'hey, that's a dope and/or cool belt, where did you get it?' Or make small talk about something that there's mutual interest in (eg some kind of nerdy hoodie)
is it still bad that im scared to do this?
I always appreciate the small compliments I get from other men. Usually it’s something like “Nice hat.” I did have someone check me out at a urinal once and tell me they thought I “handled my self well”. Weird.
Mtf here, some men as a kid do compliment people just as much as women, but society often eventually breaks them down since others don't see it as ""normal"".
New dysphoria discovered...
Good to know that other women do this. The male equivalent is the nod. All four directions mean something different.
(mtf) What guys do is nod at each other usually up is casual and down is respectful
Same but I just do it anyway, everyone deserves to be told they look good
Huh... I've kinda always complimented women, especially with nails, clothes and hair. I need to start a spreadsheet, hatching puts a lot of shit into perspective
The advice I've heard is compliment something they chose, not something they didn't. They chose to wear that cute nail polish, they didn't choose to have a nice ass (well, maybe they work out, but that's not the point).
Not quite never, that’s just a queer exclusive
u/red666111 quick PSA though I am reliably informed that if a woman tells you she ""likes your pants"" that in fact does mean ""nice ass""
To be fair, 'nice ass' is specific.
lol as a lesbian i feel both of these. i want to be nice but sometimes im also flirting a little bit.... but most often im to scared anyways so i keep to myself 😅
you got to see the cool rocks!!
me too 😩😵‍💫
Awesome! Thanks for the advice. The random compliments make me feel really good about myself and I’d love to reciprocate
I think you missed the question
Yup, same here
Wait? Women don't nod to each other? Shit, most days that is all I can muster
sounds it lol, or you just had really uniquely emotionally thoughtful friends?
I notice that I get friendly attention from the gender I dress as almost exclusively. 

Like if I have my eyelashes on and I look cute and stuff, the coffee girls love me. 
But if I’m in my baggy boy clothes, straight guys come out of the woodwork saying dorky shit like “nice fit” and “cool threads”

Like dang, is it that easy? I’m in a ten dollar hoodie and pajama pants at the bar. I gotta work so much harder to fit in with the gals lol
...we have the exact same avatar don't we...

You're my sister now I've decided.
me too!!
I had a non-binary individual complement me once on my painted nails back when I was still mostly boy-mode and just starting to experiment with my gender identity. It was literally the first time in my life a stranger had ever complimented me 😅
Lol yeah that makes sense. It didn’t really scare me - was just a pleasant surprise. One more nice thing from transitioning I guess lol
That makes sense! I am in the states. That’s interesting how it seems to differ by country
nope!! ladies love to compliment other ladies.
Cis (bi) female here and I love to throw out non-sexual, non-flirty compliments to men and women alike, but I compliment women way more because it doesn't often get misconstrued as it does with men.

Edit: dumb phone typo
Totally agreed
Yeah! It’s been a delightful discovery 💙
Also just find something u like about her to shoot back or even just a thanks girl!! Nothing dramatic necessary!
I definitely support this! It’s insane to me how little support men get 😔
LMAO that’s hilarious 😂
They do. It's just not as common. I've always been an effeminate man. I honestly find being complimented in men's spaces far more welcoming than women's spaces. 

In the men spaces I've been in they will tell me they like my boots, think it's cool that I paint my nails, or tell me that I have flowing hair.

When I'm in women's spaces I get a lot more compliments, which is nice for some people, but for me the way they compliment can be overbearing. Getting every feature of my outfit and style pointed out and commented on is incredibly uncomfortable for me. It makes me feel more like a display than a person.
Nope! I lived as a man for 27 years and was not once complimented by a single stranger
I'm my experience that only comes after you have some small talk with the guy.
anytime i see just like a fit or a hairstyle or an accessory or anything i like or find cool i just like say hi and compliment them real quick takes like 3 seconds you dont even have to like stop walking or anything it's LOVELY
My partner prepared me for this! I’m mtf and before I started transitioning I always wanted to compliment cis women on their hair or nails but was afraid they would look at me like a creep. My partner said cis women love to be complimented on things like that and they 100% would not look at me like a creep. I practiced on the ladies that work at my local convenience store because I’m in there every morning. They were so happy that I noticed and told me I had nice shoes, so I think that’s the appropriate response - to return the compliment. It’s so weird that cis men just don’t compliment each other like that when liking compliments is a genderless thing. Normalize giving and receiving compliments!
It’s fine to just say thank you! Sometimes, especially if they’re a new item, I’ll be like “oh thanks I got them at ___” and then the person will say something like “cool i love their stuff!” or you can compliment them back if you find something to compliment! it’s not required though lol. you can just say thanks and move on
So thanks is often enough, only compliment them back if it is genuine. Don't go through the motions, as being read as disingenuous is worse.

If they complement your dress, be excited and thank them, and if you quickly catch anything you like, then say something, otherwise, wish them a good day. This was one of the hardest social skills for my anxiety ridden ass to master.
just saying thanks is fine! but cis women like it when you compliment them back - if they say they like your hair, say you really like their outfit, for example

when i was younger, all my friends were guys and they never complimented anything (they loved trading insults though lmao). halfway through secondary school i made friends with some girls, and they started conplimenting me occasionally - just ""i like your shirt!"" and stuff, and it compmetely floored me every time, so i was really awkward (""oh! uhhh, thanks?"") amd it came off really weird lmao

then one day i had the radical experience of, once again, panicking, but this time i just blurted out ""i like your hair!"" and they smiled so genuinely, it really made my day
as long as you compliment on something they decided about their appearance, like a hair cut or clothes or sticker on a laptop or cool nails. be very careful with any compliments about someone's appearance, but sincere compliments about something someone chose for themselves can be very uplifting. whereas telling a woman she's really gorgeous out of nowhere may make her feel threatened. basically it's just common sense, do unto others as you would have them do to you kind of thing. 

now that I reread that it's solid advice for anyone who is feeling socially awkward wrt approaching people. comments regarding someone's appearance in a positive way can be taken completely the wrong way, good or bad. or misinterpreted. a compliment can be powerful. words are powerful, and so is my social anxiety lol.
Yea, at best a guy will say another one looks sharp.  When I was trying to be a guy I feel like it always came down to his being afraid to be seen as gay for why they never did it.  Idk if that's true since i was never really a guy but that's what I gathered from it.

TLDR... Toxic masculinity is why guys don't compliment each other.
Usually better to return the compliment, but only if it’s a real/believable one. So like complimenting something they’re wearing or clearly put effort into, like hair or nails. The only bad compliment is one that’s implausible or sarcastic, like saying ‘nice shoes’ when someone is wearing muddy work boots. 

Saying thank you is also an ok response, but if you don’t return the compliment in some way it’s generally understood to mean you don’t want to socialize, either for personal reasons (tired, grumpy, etc) or because you dislike that specific person.
The proper response is ""Thanks! It has pockets!"" or ""Thanks! I got it at \[insert store\]"" or ""Thanks! I got it on sale!"" and yes, you can absolutely compliment them back.
Just a thank you or a reciprocated compliment is fine! And I concur with everyone else, this is quite common. Though I would argue that even if someone did think you were trans and chose to compliment you, they just think they’re being encouraging and supportive. I’ve definitely found things to compliment other trans folks on before as (hopefully) a little bit of reassurance. 💙
Compliment them back or thank them 😊
Thank you is a perfect response.
Good responses to compliments:

""Thanks! It has pockets."" (Literally anything with pockets)

""Thank you! I just got them done/I did them myself."" (Nails, hair, etc).

""Thank you! I love yours too!""
UNLESS it has pockets that aren't obvious, then your response is to ALWAYS show off that you have pockets! 

""Great skirt!""  
""Thanks, it has pockets!""
If it's a dress/skirt and it has pockets the usual response is ""thanks! IT HAS POCKETS""
Lol you have to learn how girls actp
Just say “thank you!”
Omg you're absolutely right. This has happened to me before too (I'm MtF).
the same happened to me but i had a boyfriend so he realized i wasn't interested soon. few months later tried to get me into a pyramid scheme lmao.
I'd say just own it and be yourself :) But as long as you can read the recipient and know they'll be receptive of it lol. I'm mtf but when I used to present male I'd still compliment dudes all the time, usually just a ""hey I like your shirt!"" or something like that and it seemed like it usually brightened their mood a little. Men almost never receive compliments which makes me sad.

I did have this male coworker once with really amazing long hair and I remember asking him what shampoo he used because I was lowkey jealous lol but I know he got a kick out of someone liking his hair and I don't think he assumed I was into him either.
You can still compliment other men but as sophiazoekim said a few posts above this one, men are a bit more indirect about it.
I would genuinely love to compliment men more but it's hard because a lot of men interpret stuff like that as sexual or romantic.
yep, totally good advice
This is SOLID GOLD advice
There's also the level of comfortability with someone. Someone you don't know ""your dress is so cute"". Someone you know a bit ""that dress looks so cute on you"". Someone you are pretty close to ""you look so good in that dress"". And someone you are very close to or in a close romantic relationship ""you look so good"".
“Your ass looks great in those jeans.”

“Thanks girl! I got them on sale from Ross!”

*internal screaming*
I feel that. Though i’m a transgirl myself, sometimes i feel really self-conscious when i try to flirt with other girls.
Of course! It was really weird learning how to give compliments now that I mostly pass and not come off as a creep.

Cis lady here! I'm really fond of,  ""wow, I love your dress/bag/shoes!"" And,  as suggested above,  ""I love that color on you!"" If it's something I'm interested in for myself and I have time, this usually transitions into,  ""where did you get that? It's great!""

People put so much care and effort in how they look, and I think it's important to recognize their successes. I try to complement men, too, but cautiously, so they don't think I'm flirting.
Just trying to give advice, everyone else already chimed in with the fact it’s normal so I didn’t really feel the need to echo chamber.
They smile instead of nod
No I mean random strangers,,, this thread has really changed my perspective damn
omg we do! what are the odds. #twinning
My non-trans female (or possibly NB woman) perspective: I'm going to break this down because autism & social cues have been difficult for me h many trans women have told me this advice was helpful.

Sometimes it can be either of the two possible reasons you mentioned, OP, but try not to get a complex about it because the compliments are coming from a girl or woman (who does not want to make you uncomfortable) who is telling you, ""I see you as amazing today & I love it when other women compliment me so I will compliment you.""

This is similar to ""the nod"" I have seen men do when they acknowledge each other & wish to communicate respect/acceptance while passing each other anywhere or when sharing a space together.

Either possibility (whether you're perceived as cis or trans) communicates two possible but similar possibilities:

1. you've been perceived as cis + non-threatening (and worthy of a compliment because they genuinely like an aspect of your appearance)

...or, maybe... 

2. you've been perceived as not-a-man or as a trans woman + non-threatening (and worthy of a compliment because they genuinely like an aspect of your appearance).

Either way, whoever does it isn't treating/seeing you like a man & generally the compliments are genuine so try to enjoy them.  Also, it's considered polite to either say ""OMG thank you so much"", or to say something similar plus a return compliment about something that stands out about them.
There you go then- just american women being american women haha And not only are you being treated like the woman you are, you’re getting compliments! Enjoy!

ETA: Regarding differences between countries; while there’s a lot of negative stereotypes about the states, the most prevalent positive one is that americans are super friendly (and seems to be very much true in my experience) so I guess it’s just part of that. I’ve even had strangers start chatting to me on the bus there- it’s definitely a culture shock haha
Am lady, can confirm!
I’m AMAB, and complimented women all the time. They either thought I was hitting on them, or that I was gay. Really I just confused most of them. Most dudes didn’t compliment their fashion so accurately. Haha.
Seconded! Normalize giving and receiving compliments! We need more positivity in the world.
This is almost word for word my partners thought on the compliments too! She's been able to start complimenting people and it makes her so happy.
> before I started transiting I always wanted to compliment women [...] but was afraid they would look at me like a creep. 

*THIS.* I lived in fear of this for *years,* and since coming out it's been so gratifying to feel like I can compliment others openly. As well as using colloquial vocatives like ""hon"" and ""sweetie"" to refer to people in place of gendered honorifics. When living as a ""guy"" I feared I'd be chastised for doing this, as men complimenting others (especially women) is often viewed as strange - even predatory - behavior. I just want to be nice to people. 😭 I'm so glad I can now, but we need to normalize men giving compliments y'all. 💜 

(Also I've noticed I *receive* way more compliments now that I'm living as my authentic self. As a woman, nothing is more affirming than another gal telling you they're jealous of your hair, or how cute your socks are, or that that colour really compliments your eyes. Bless each and every one of you. TwT 💜💕💜
[deleted]
Am I literally your partner? 👀
My girlfriend and I are doing the exact same thing lol
Cis men are absolutely mortified at the idea of doing or saying anything that can be taken as gay.
I get way too flustered by random compliments I’ll just squeak out a small “thank you” blush and run away.. I’m too shy for these things
It’s terrifying but also the best thing ever
Omg me and my girlfriends (some cis and some not) love to shit talk lmao. It’s a good bonding experience IMO aslong as you know the lines and you don’t pile on one person (atleast not without balancing it out after)
Thanks very much for the advice! That makes a lot of sense
Luckily I have good instincts and Linda pick out which ones I think won’t be weird about it pretty well lol, but damn if it isn’t hard sometimes
I heard it from someone else. Just paying it forward.
Phew, at least it's non verbal
>No I mean random strangers,,,

Yo wtf
\*\*\*toxic masculinity\*\*\*
I’m cis male and gay but I don’t think people realize I’m gay at first. I like to compliment women on their hair or clothes. I sometimes wonder if it comes off as flirting but most straight men would never notice.
Lol, both actually, hit and gay
I think it's important how (what) you compliment. Compliments about body give very bad vibes (especially saying a woman is sexy, hot, etc. !!!). Complimenting clothes, hair, shoes, etc. is generally okay. If a man-presenting person doesn't add a weird stare or do it in an inappropriate situation, they should be okay.

I am afab enby and compliments are something I won't miss once I can pass as a man. It's so weird for me that people compliment looks XD
I have nothing but outright respect for that outfit (please tell me he's a shorter guy)
yeah nah, these dudes picked a target and fucking went for them lmao. they were like piranhas, just picked one of the guys in the group and if he reacted, they completely ganged up on him until he exploded - one of them was literally sobbing and yelling at them to fuck off and they were still laughing their heads off... anyways, that friend group gave me depression :D
I wish Linda could help me with that too.
Women seem to assume any man talking to them is hitting on them. You big flirt. ;)
> Compliments about body give very bad vibes 

Oh, definitely! A lot of people are guilty of this -- older men, especially, in my experience. And I would never comment on someone in that way, regardless of my gender presentation or theirs, unless they were asking for that commentary specifically. 

But aside from that - and partially *because* of that more severe issue - when living as a ""guy"" I felt like there was a stigma about complimenting women, even respectfully, because I feared that any form compliment would be taken as flirting, and unsolicited flirting would be seen as creepy. Of course, this mentality was borne of the cishet normativity I was raised in, as well as my own anxiety. But from some other people's responses in this thread, it seems like I'm not the only one who got that feeling. 😅 

Regardless, I'm happy that I feel more confident complimenting others now! And I'm happy for you to be receiving unwanted comments less often. 😆
Linda?
I really just wanna do their hair!
>and Linda pick out which ones I think won’t be weird

You made a typo (or rather autocorrect did, I guess)
That was probably one of the best responses to that statement. 👌

Update !
I was out to my parents for 1.5 year but this was an ""I don't give a f*ck"" situation. They're not unsupportive but not supportive. They just let my live my life.
Since septembre I was away for studies and a lot happen, a trans friend gave me her old stuff (all my actual fem clothes). This week I returned to the family house in girl mode and I was like ""My parents will not give a shit of my clothes"". And...I was totally right ! But that's good ! I'm not rejected or something!

Again, thank you all for your amazing support ! ❤ You're all so kind and supportive ! 💗 Thank you ! (I'm not crying! You are !)
You look cute and may the odds be ever in your favor.
Adorbs everything will be ok
No matter what remember you look beautiful
Good luck!! 
Also super cute
I sincerely hope things went well!
I feel like every trans girl owns this flannel lol, rock that outfit girl!

Tbh, my parents are more the ""I don't give a shit"" type, so that's OK
Oh sorry when I saw first time my parents will see me in fem clothes I thought you were coming out.You are still very cute regardless
Very welcome! Could get lost in your eyes

I understand it can be hard for the first time I’d say just try to push your self through the first time and you’ll instead not be scared but can’t say for everyone and I came out really young at 2nd grade
I wish I had the courage you have.
Lol
I always forget how cute it is when skirts spin
Good for you!!~
That’s amazing that your GF doesn’t mind you being trans every relationship I’ve here’d about as soon as the other party found out there trans the relationship ended the only time I didn’t hear that is with my own relationship which would probably not matter as much to her because she’s pan sexual and not a lesbian and she’s transgender herself
I’m glad to hear the support it’s not that common I hear support for being trans
Wish my family would be supportive 🙄
My relationship didn't end either but it turns out my partner is also trans lol
T for T here too. We're both nonbinary, but I didn't find out about myself until later lol. I'm still working it out but they've been in a stable place with their gender since I first met them.

Even with this kind of understanding there is still a lot of complexity introduced to the relationship. Have to get pretty creative sometimes.
I’m sorry it can be hard my dad is really weird about it so I kinda feel you"	uao7eu	trans	1759	0.97	2022-04-24 06:08:25
my dad took me clothes shopping at men’s clothing stores [ftm]	"after school my dad asked if i wanted to go down to the malls in the closest city to go shopping for clothes as he just got a new job. when we went we went to men-targeted clothing stores and everytime he talked to the cashiers he used he/him pronouns! my dad has always been relatively supportive of my transition but this has been the first time he’s taken me shopping to the same stores as him and has consistently used the correct pronouns. he even called me his son!! i’m so amazingly elated that i’m shaking as i write this!! i almost feel like i’m about to cry from joy. this is the most euphoria i’ve felt since getting my binder!

hoping that anyone who reads this gets an experience like this soon because it feels amazing!!

edit: thank you for all of your wonderful comments and stories of your own! i love reading moments like these that have happened in others lives!! also to everyone who asked me to compliment my dad for them, he asked me to say for him, “thank you all and hope your transitions go well.” :)"	"That’s awesome I’m so glad this is happening to you !
Congrats man! I would hug him so tight. You are lucky. Take care
I'm very happy you have the support you need!
Congrats my man! May the support and love of your father stay FOREVERRRRR!!
You have a great dad. I’m glad you got to spend time together bonding as men.
Aww I absolutely love hearing these stories. The first time my extremely conservative mother saw me after I started presenting as a woman we sat on her bed drinking and talking for a while and she couldn't help but see me as her daughter. She spoke to me in a way that was both familiar because I have a cis sister but new because I had never experienced it. When I left that night she hugged me and told me she was happy I was her daughter 🥲. Congrats I know how great it feels.
OP this is wonderful and I'm so happy for you! My da is not quite this far with me yet (MTF) but he's always been a big advocate for my music and has been suggesting new songs to learn that'll help strengthen my high range, so I'll take it as his own weird kind of support
That's incredible op!! I (ftx/ftm) got secondhand euphoria from this post, so thank you so much!
That's so wholesome. Good job dad!
Aww 🥺 I wish my mom did this with me but the female version
This is awesome!!! I love this for you man! Must be really cool, this made me smile. Here's to all the nice dads in the world!
Oooh look at you joining the patriarchy! lol. As a trans woman I shrink from this one but it sounds like you had an amazing experience and have a good father. The closest I can come to this is I was chatting with a woman friend and a woman friend of hers who bumped into us thought I was her mum! The cheek. I 'm not that old. lol.

Good luck young shaver!
This felt so cringy until I realized you were trans masc. So excited for you. That's really sweet. Your dad sounds awesome.
Thanks for sharing this with us! What an incredibly joyful experience!
Really that's sounds good
im so happy for you, it reminds me of my awesome mom who has offered many of her old cothes to me like dresses and stuff and she has offered to teach me how to put on makeup and pluck eyebrows, and she has also bought me some feminine clothes for me.
That's super.
that’s awesome :) you should thank him!! it will mean as much to him that he’s being a good father as the shopping was to you
I'm so happy for you!!! Your dad seems so amazing
I am really glad that there are people like your father.

I am really happy for you bro
Tell your dad I think he's a legend
Thats so cool, i hope you get some nice, manly, clothes that you like
aww thats so great. congrats
this is seriously the coolest thing ever, i wish my dad had gotten to do that with me. he called me his son one (1) time and it was like the best thing ever so i totally understand
Your dad is freaking awesome!
I just told my sister yesterday that I'm transitioning (mtf), and today I sent her a picture of my hair getting longer and she said I look gorgeous. I love my family
I’m literally there with you shaking from the joy I feel for you 🥺💓
aww, thats so sweet!
I was *very* surprised too. I think seeing how happy I am is what made her accept me. She and I have always had more similar personalities and tastes than she and my sister too so I think it made it easier for her to understand me because I am **so** this woman's daughter lol. Also I'm so glad she won't bring up Trump or politics around me anymore.
this made me smile :)

i havent come out to my mother but i am planning to, this year. and i hope things between us dont change... but even if they do, seeing that even a conservative parent is eventually accepting her daughter, really gave me some hope.

i guess when there's true love, unconditional love; when a parent truly loves their child, nothing will come in the way, even if things get tough and it takes long.
You seem like a lovely person and I hope it goes well for you! I mean things did change between my mom and I because it is different being a daughter rather than a son, but if anything we're closer now than we were before. 

My mother was not always a great parent but she does love her family unconditionally. It took her about 6 months to get to the point where she was willing to see me in person after I came out to her but I know now that she was committed to being my mother no matter what(though I did not know that last part during those six months and was very worried she could never accept me)
thank you so much :)

i'm so glad that your mother finally accepted you! must have been such a relief when she met you again after those six months...
Finally feeling like myself in front of her was so freeing after waiting that long. Hanging out with her as her oldest daughter for the first time will always be one of my favorite memories. She had never been so candid about my sister either and it was *hilarious*.
cute! 😊"	sspo0s	trans	1735	0.99	2022-02-15 00:34:18
Girls, All Your Clothes Are Women's Clothes.		"What we wear makes them women's clothes ! Rawrrr!
You look great, love your style!🤘🏻
Holy shit hi Georgie! Fancy seeing you outside of discord. Cute fit!
Indeed not only are they women's but they are mine. Masculine, feminine, and anyone who finds themselves outside of the binary, wear what makes you most exceptional. 

Also, I want to talk about that Studio Easel in the background. Is it yours? Was that painting on the wall made on it? From one trans artist to possibly another, I'd love to see some art.
Always great to see another Metal Girl!
If you are wearing it, it is women's clothing.
Trans girl Metallica fan? Girl just be my bestie already /s
That makes me want a Kill ‘Em All shirt because you look great in it
Trying to make out what’s on your shirt. Cute look btw
They are but also I like the fit of “women’s clothes” more, it’s not just a label 🙃
Your face is so pretty girl!
I learned this but only after I learned that I've been wearing shirts one size too big for me my entire life. Always hated form fitting clothes. I wonder why 🤔
Damn girl, I love the look! Very much my vibe right down to the thrash metal tee.
such a cute look!!
I have that shirt too and I love it
Hell yeah loving the KEA shirt
you should rip the sleeves and get a bullet belt for maximum metal performance
I'm more of a Ride the Lightning girl myself but you still cute 😍
you look great!

ive also seen you in a discord server before lol
Yeah Metallica, you go girl!!
All your base are belongs to us?
Yeah! That's a good way to think about it
There are just the clothes I like and the clothes I don't like but use to hide myself from my family T_T.

You look so good, tho. Love your stile ❤
you’re so stunning omg
Fuck yeah🤘
Hot. And nice shirt 💖
My favorite Metallica album!
REAL! Honestly the amount of t-shirts i either cropped or tie in the back is astounding.
Best album they ever did.
MTF here I wear nothing but black band shirts with a skirt and leggings
METALLLICA!!!
Oh I love that shirt! And that album.
based based your based. i wish i had the confidence to live this statement.
Exactly! Love the outfit.
This is what is want to say to myself but in reverse. Boys, all your clothes are mens clothes. I miss dressing feminine. I was much more stylish. Now I have only a few outfits that I can cycle through for each season.
This is a very nice, and truthful post. I really like this post, because people don't always have to dress all crazy, and show tons of skin all the time to be admired by others. So thank you, and please take care😉
Great Metallica album but Garage Inc. and Master of Puppets are better
You are so cute girly.
OH NO!!!!! Now how will I boymode in front of my family?
Normally I think metal girls look like Susie from Deltarune as a human, but you don't.
Your actually cuter than them, so I think that's why
When she has the kill em all shirt 😍😍😍
I know, but my disphoria doesnt
Of course ..lol I don't even remember what size u wear in mens .lol .I been wearing women's clothes since I was 11 ..
Wear what I can unfortunately I’m too broke to buy new clothes grrrrr…
I'm not going to pretend like 40 years didn't exist and during the latter half of those 40 years I was fly as a motherfucker when it came to fashion it was a little bit androgynous but people would class it as male with a little bit of style street wear flare that sort of thing I have a few like really fucking dope ass shirts and other things I haven't worn clothes meant for dudes in a long time but I haven't got rid of them why would I girls with t-shirts and jeans it's a thing duh I'm going to look fine no matter what I wear
I suppose so since they are mine I do still love my giant 'boys' hoodie though.
Metallica! Fuck yeah!
They’re not men’s or women’s clothes. *I’m* wearing them. They’re *my* clothes.

thanks. but I don't even know what my style is!!!
they let me out when i need my updoots.  
thanks love x
Awww there discord friends 🥰
Very True. For many people what we wear is an expression of who we are.  
I studied art at school and have been an artist for years but sorta just do it solely as meditation and introspection now. I mostly do abstract expressionism, but been all over the contemporary spectrum and digital. Might make some more pieces as the spring comes around. Don't really photograph my work, just put it up and throw it in the folio haha.
Metal has a suprisingly wholesome community, and a whole lot of awesome trans people c:
I know you're not talking to me, but even though I personally am not a metal girl, I do like one metal band, a Christian one called skillet, I know what you're thinking... ""But christians are transphobic monsters!"" And while that's mostly true, there are also a lot of Christians who actually support the trans community. I'm a Christian, actually. I was on the fence about transitioning, because I thought it was against my beliefs, but then I stopped reading between the lines, because I heard that helps the bible make more sense, and I got to the verses that say that, and technically it's talking about crossdressing, not being trans.
Metallica  
Kill 'Em All
title is talking to trans lesbians who are afraid of dressing more butch, because of my own experience, but definitely a wider context here. <3
I like your thinking.  
Screw it, I should just go full Sarah Connor.
suppose i should take a selfie in that t shirt aswell. first one i ever bought!

for whom the bell tolls omg

I dont know exactly what mine is either so i totally get it but at least in this pic the rock/metal look suits you really well
My style is still hoodie and jeans  :(
I didn't study art until college due to ego and identity issues connected to old siblings who were prodigies with drawing. 

So is it mostly painting then? I wouldn't say Art is meditative for me but the flow state/hyper focus can be calming. I'm a big fan of process oriented works. Sculpture, digit vectors, printing and ceramics. The more steps the better I feel as I make it. Setting down with a canvas and working on it from start to finish is intimidating for me. When I do paint I break it down into steps and layers.
Fun fact the band originally wanted to call the album ""Metal up your ass"" but the record label said no for some reason. You look great btw.
Yeeees. That bass line is just *chef's kiss*
Makes sense
apparently <3
Hey hoodie and jeans can be a cool and sexy look 😉
the long haul that is a large piece, is why i have my area dedicated to being able to walk over and carry on whenever. i do oil pastels and coloured pencils atm.
They put it on shirts instead. It's glorious. https://i.etsystatic.com/6271460/r/il/c23e8e/3250427891/il_1140xN.3250427891_oqib.jpg
that is a fun fact. i can imagine that title on a jokey dad version of this t-shirt... and yea, id wear it.  
thanks x
Well I think the piece on the wall is fascinating, if you wanted to share privately, I'd enjoy talking about them. Meditative Art can be wonderful for the flow of thought that can come from them. Where you started and where you ended. How you knew it was done and if you expressed yourself as you intended or if you surprised yourself. If I'm doing meditative art is mostly sketch book work that I mine later for Art piece. 

I don't post many finished pieces online myself as I really value the physical object vs the subject and imagery. Not that the content and concepts are secondary. I just fall in love with the artifacts created in the process. My most cherished pieces are the blocks of wood I carve to make my prints.

Under Texas law, I'm now considered a sex offender. See y'all when I'm out of prison.	"Edit: I was slightly misinformed at first. The law hasn't passed passed, it has up to now *only* passed the senate. Somehow that doesn't make me feel entirely better, but here's hoping the house still has some sense. It passed the Senate 20-11. I also found out today the guy who created the bill is a senator in the same city as me. He's literally MY rep. How did I get so lucky?

To my knowledge the law hasn't taken effect yet but it did pass. But it's worded ambiguously on purpose, like most laws are, enabling the enforcers to discriminate at their discretion whatever poor sap they choose. This law in particular bans drag ""performances"" in any public space where a child might potentially see it, including in grocery stores or restaurants. It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a way that doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth. According to the law, simply wearing ""women's clothes"" when you're ""biologically a man"" could be construed as ""drag"". It goes deeper, also including other typically gendered ""accessories"" such as long hair on a ""man"", makeup or having your nails done. What does this mean in practice? It's simple. I could be seen as grooming kids, and arrested for it, for simply having makeup on when I go to the grocery store. My options? Keep doing what I'm doing and hope nothing bad happens (this is what I choose) or get scared, let the fascists win and just conform and comply, let my gender dysphoria return with a vengeance when it's finally starting to dissipate, and probably before too long, return to suicidal ideation. (This is not what I choose) Aren't you guys glad we live in the freest country in the world?"	"Start reporting Republican women when they wear pants
I am speechless. In which universe is the wearing of clothes related to grooming?
Keep the ACLU contact handy: [https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas](https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas)
Call fhe cops on every priest wearing a robe. After all that's a dress. Maybe they'll even find actual grooming going
Easy solution, get all the menopausal republican women reported for being too masculine. This law is so easily abusable that they'll soon realise they're going to have to sift through a thousand non-trans people before they can even find a single trans person
wtf is happening to america
You know America really prides itself on being ""land of the free"" yet every day so many people become less and less free, and I don't think they're actually considering how this is going to affect people in the long run as well

Because this is just beginning, theyre taking rights away from us and others then sooner or later we're going to see them take rights away from so many more, Just because it doesn't affect someone now doesn't mean it's not always going to and that's what these close-minded selfish dumbasses need to start thinking about. If they don't care about us maybe they'll care about themselves when they get their own rights taken
Fucking Texas.
My solution? Blow up call centers about politicians and right wing news anchors wearing makeup and how your son is now asking why men wear makeup. Why are sex offenders trying to indoctrinate my children into their trans culture?! I can’t even. 😤 

Texas is a joke of a state. Doesn’t have a working power grid, kids dying by the dozen from shootings, but clearly the biggest issue is men in makeup. 😑
I am also in TX and dont know what this is about

Do you have a link my friend?!?

EDIT If anyone also in TX wants to message me my inbox is open. Sylvia Rivera kept a list of all the trans folks she knew and their emergency contacts in her bible. that, along with her other activism, inspired me to want to network to other trans folks near me. so my inbox is open  and i would love to hear from you 🩷
Jeans, pants of any kind, shorts of any kind, t-shirts of any kind, short skirts (ever heard of kilts anyone), hosiery, heels, combat boots, cowboy boots, gladiator sandals, Oxford style shirts, polo shirts, tank tops, cowboy hats, boyshort underwear,"" boyfriend"" style shirts, business suits, aviator glasses, tennis shoes,... the number of cis women they'll need to prosecute for wearing these traditionally masculine and often clearly meant for men clothes. The  number of retail stores being fined for daring to sell these make items on a mass scale to cis women.
Ted Cruz's senate seat is up for a vote in 2024, Start by voting that POS out. Lots of down ballot races too. Take a stand! And if not you're always welcome here in Oregon.
The concern is valid. However SB 12 has only passed the senate. Holding out hope for the House being more sensible.
A similar law was shot down by the courts in Tennessee. Hope you can get the same justice!
Returning to suicidal ideation is what they want. They want “the 41%” to go much higher so that they can act holier than thou and blame free. “iT’s nOt mY fAuLt tHeY cOmMiTtEd sUiCiDe.”

Yes. Yes, it is. It is 100% your fault, GOP politicians. Cut the “we want small government” shit. You love big government when it’s used as a means to harass, persecute, and subjugate. If y’all would just leave us the fuck alone and go back to privately pretending like we don’t exist, that would be super.
This is what eventually caused the Stonewall riots, just to be clear. Here we fucking go again, I guess.
Civil penalty of $10 each?...lol cmon Texas, ya dumb af!

Don't be scared hun, stay educated and live your life...all the bathroom bills passed when I transitioned in deep red Texas a few years ago and I worked in the state capitol building...let me tell ya, no one said a single goddamn thing...

Pardon my wordage! ;) <3
“Hey Patrick! What am I now?”
I concur with any suggestion for malicious compliance and weaponization of the law. However, what's missing is basically how to go about that safely. 

First up, be in contact with a law professional. This law WILL backfire so there's probably some legally-inclined allies out there waiting to help use their knowledge and abilities to help it get overturned in courts.

Second, loopholes, loopholes, loopholes. Study up the law like it's the Bible and figure out what you can do that you can't be arrested for. The ambiguity inherent in it will allow you to exist comfortably as you want to, just with a few caveats.

Lastly, break the law. Not by direct illegal resistance to it but by using itself as a weapon against itself. This circle back to my first point of getting in contact with someone who knows legal stuff because you want to do things that would get you in trouble, put you in a courtroom, and force the court to evaluate the legitimacy of the law. You want to coordinate this with a community of people who the law effects (which include basically anyone who works with clothes and makeup) so that no single individual bears the cost of the case and the number of problems with the law become more apparent. 

But above all else, survival while oppressed is better than death while oppressed. Be cautious, focus on your health and well-being, and make enough sacrifices to keep yourself safe. Do not conform totally but don't risk it all just to lose it all in prison unless you plan on writing a book.
What? It's normal for men to have longer hair, and I hope there's a fucking outrage this is a violation of human rights! Aren't the Republicans the ones who love America bc of our ""free country?"" It's not freedom if people are being forced to comply to rules that sound like they came from religious transphobes
I live in one of the states that followed Texas, and managed to pass a law like this. It's super scary and difficult, because I've already socially transitioned and changed my name. At this point, I don't own anything that wouldn't be considered Drag under these bills. I've been transitioning for 3 years, I don't have my old clothes or name or anything anymore, and can't afford to buy a new wardrobe to re-stealth. I haven't been able to afford my hormones either for about a year, so I look obviously trans right now. I'm stuck in a terrible place. Even going to the store is a terrifying ordeal.  


I really wish we didn't have to go through these kinds of things. I wish I could help you, but at least I can say you aren't alone. We'll all get through this together somehow.
>It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a waythat doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth.

This isn't fair. I completely agree that sex, nudity and raunch shouldn't be exposed to kids, but drag queens typically aren't doing that stuff around minors. I've been to the drag queen story hours where I live. Reading Babar books while wearing a dress isn't sexual or offensive.
Do they realize that practically every painting of Jesus he has long flowing hair, and is never seen wearing slacks or a button down shirt? 


Hey Texas, I learned in school about a bunch of men who wore curly wigs, tights, and high heeled shoes: the founding fathers!  (Some of them even spoke French) 


And how about makeup? I'm sure tough guys like Trump or Chuck ""Texas Ranger"" Norris would never wear make up,except every single time they are in front of a camera. 


Anyways, good luck in prison, along with a very large chunk of the rest of the state.
Wait they arrest men with long hair, nails and makeup? Can't wait to see them arrest a Black metal musician
Just move a bit north up here to New Mexico where your rights are protected and the community is absolutely fine with you being here.  We have legal weed, free college, and the most bomb food you'll ever ear.

&#x200B;

We even passed the ""Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act"" which codifies our rights.  We even allow people to change their gender on their drivers license without a doctors note.  Even ""x"" if you want to identify as non-binary or gender neutral (That's what's on my license)  


  
This place kicks ass.
Can someone link me the law that passed? Is it SB12 or something else? Thanks in advance
Are you referring to bill [HB4378](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/TX/HB4378) ?
Leave. Even Mexico is better than this shit.
Nothing says freedom like forcing everyone else to conform to the exact lifestyle you think is best
I’m having fun imagining effeminate trans men and masculine trans women mess with their brains x)
As people above say once a stupid amount of reports get submitted and people use it against them then it’ll soon stop being enforced.

It’s the same concept as the book bill that was passed lately, the intent was to stop being able to teach about lgbt and sex under the guise of it being inappropriate for children so people have started to report the bible for the same thing and under their law it’s entirely reasonable to do so.

They will not have thought this through enough for the consequences that will happen
Sorry for spamming the hell out of your post OP. thank you so much for making it or I wouldnt know this even happened. The disinformation makes it hard to sort fact from fiction. 

Sylvia Rivera was arrested over 200 times for ""upper head female impersonation"" and what did she say? She said ""I REFUSE to pass!"" She compared it to a POC passing as white. 

OP I encourage you to listen to her old interviews... Making Gay History's first ep of their podcast has an interview with her and a lot of other fiesty historical queer folks that will comfort and motivate you. Ive been listening to it and it helps, i promise, to hear people from the 70s or 40s talk about what they went through and hearing the radical shit they were saying/doing then. 

As Chuck Rowland in s1e7 of the podcast, who got fired for being gay and fought it for 15 years until the government sent him a letter apologizing, said... This is how people get radicalized--  they get fucked with! And they see its bullshit, and the light comes on and they fight back
This has not been passed into law yet!!! Texas SB12:

https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604#:~:text=Texas%20Senate%20Bill%2012&text=Bill%20Title%3A%20Relating%20to%20restricting,penalty%3B%20creating%20a%20criminal%20offense.&text=By%3A%20Hughes%2C%20et%20al
So basically no Scottish bagpipes, no rock concerts, no football (paint on the face), no male news anchors and no actors existing in the state of Texas
a similar law that was passed just died in Tennessee recently (one of the most sickeningly red states in the country). keep your chin up, girl! 🥰
So…go naked?
They will have to arrest all women wearing jeans and shirts and other male clothing.
fun fact: most state legislatures personal info including: phone numbers, addresses, full names, emails, etc. are available online on either their website or the states government website, i was able to find that the one who introduced this bill (gov. dan patrick)  has a p.o. box which i’m not saying what it is
This is horrible.. we live in an AWFUL place now.. what happened to everyone..???? 😔✊🏳️‍🌈🤍✨
Please encourage everyone you know (well those who are open minded & progressive) to register to vote and then actually vote. We have to get our country back on track and the only way to make positive strides is to vote these conservatives out of office. We need the majority vote in both the house and the the senate.
The land of the free. Equal rights for all.

Except black people, asian people, hispanic people, jewish people, gay people, women, muslims...

Everybody who's not a white man.

No y'know what not even white people. Nobody gets any rights.
You have another realistic option too, and that's move out of the christostan caliphate to an actual free part of the county.  Life has never been better for us in solidly blue states.
I hate it here. I wish I could be taken away from Texas myself
I swear to god this is one of the most flawed fucked up laws in American history. Imma start reporting Republican women for wearing pants, Republican politicians for wearing makeup(how else does trumps face get that orange), maybe be a little malicious and report everyone I see because how would I know what’s in their pants?
Or, leave the state if you can, return later with ...... Not reddit safe intents.

Theirs either human rights, or bullets flying in the defense of human rights
It doesn’t matter what happens. I’m going to fight for my happiness no matter what
Wtf doesn't the US have more serious problems? Like in general? Oh well divide and conquer right? How can there be a majority for any laws like that, not just within the general population but even within the gop?

Well in for a country that feels comfortable incarcerating 505 ppl per 100000, which actually is a huge improvement if you can believe it by about 190 from 2018, it kinda tracks, I just guess they felt like they were missing a couple of prison slaves in their prison industrial complex to line their pockets.

At this point it seems the only 3 options left would be to either take radical steps to strip them of their power, generalstrike have EVERYONE lay down their work until they step down [maybe just have everyone dienie just republicans any type of service might work] a revolution something like a civil war or removing your self and as many people and money as you can from the economy and move it to a different country maybe even Mexico, that would be fun to see the reaction of politicians when Mexico economy is growing while the US economy is falling into a deep recession 

Internationally how about sanctions? We're more than just one nation. Maybe have all US trans people ask for asylum and force political action of other nations, because of draconian prosecution. If Western nations condem Russia for this type of shit a couple of years ago they should do the same  to the US.
Only word of advice for you: join your local Pink Pistols, Socialist RA, or EFJBC chapter, organize, and be VERY cautious. Don't go quietly into the night.
My biological sex is transgender woman.. because my Brian tells me I am a woman and I was born with a mistake. And my Brian is my biology 🧬
(This is just anger and nothing SERIOUS however I feel like I have a point)
Today marks the day that I declare war upon those who have forsaken us. No longer will our country of ""Freedom"" be defined by who we are at birth, but who we are on the inside. Now...

WHO'S WITH ME
So sad. These fascist hoes be fucking with us. I am here if you need me.
Last I heard it only passed in the Senate. I hope something happens that stops it before it passes the house. Otherwise, I’m right there with you!  I’m not going to do anything different, but my wife and I are already making plans.
This could lead to some very terrible things or situations, this is wild but not really totally a surprise considering it's texas. I feel for all the people down there in that area who have to worry about that kind of thing... Worry what might happen to them since who really knows at this point, the law is so ambiguous it could be anything.
💔
Does anyone have a source for this? I’m trying to google but I can’t find much. Just trying to make sure I understand which states are safe to go to and which ones aren’t and why. Thanks!
I unironically would feel more safe living with that one isolated tribe on north sentinel island than in America. Luckily my family is getting the fuck out the moment I turn eighteen but at this point I don't know if we'll even get the chance
Same here in Tennessee.  Except here it's only a temporary judicial order keeping it from being currently active.
Get as many people in texas to report as many people as possible, flood the system with false reports, that should piss them off and hopefully anyone “guilty” will slip through unnoticed, then burn the system to the ground (take that as literally as you feel like taking it)
i’m usually pretty good and understand the “other” person’s side.  like even if i don’t agree, i can still understand where they’re coming from, even if their logic’s really flawed, but how is dressing as an opposite gender grooming?  what could you possibly be grooming a child for by wearing a dress?  and by grooming, i mean the textbook definition, how tf is it grooming?
Well they define drag pretty clearly I guess. How do they define ""performance""?
We will not comply!
How bout report cis women for wearing traditional men’s clothing
freedom country and the war against freedom, ep 1
Seems all are welcome here in Maine where I live. Even the womans restrooms are ok for us girls. Everyone seems to be easy going on this issue and I really don't understand why other states are so stupid.
This law doesn’t make sense. I’m gender nonconforming and under this new law, I’d be a sex offender and so would just about anyone else. WTF are Texan girls wearing these days, prairie dresses? Fuuuuuuuuuu
This is dystopian how does the land of the free call itself such when people want to dictate how people express themselves
Why is it that trans women seem to get all the hate but I never see lawmakers or others targeting trans men? Do people outside the community just not think trans men exist or what?
Reason #230984230948239084092384092849023849023 to never ever visit Texas.
Report everyone for everything. Men with long hair, women with short hair. Men who wear bracelets (you know those “manly” bracelets?) Women wearing pants. Men with earrings. No one is safe report them ALL.
Some people in the thread are talking about reporting women for wearing men’s clothing to make a point. Please do not do this. That behavior is going to enforce gender checks for trans mascs and POC in particular will be at much higher risk for assault and death. Any older person will remember the articles laws, these gender check assaults impacted all of us, please do not weaponize the police.
have you ever documented anything about your transition officially? name changes, gender changes, anything like that?
I just want civil war & to divide already, or Die trying.
I'm apolitical, so don't have a strong opinion either way. 

I am curious as to why some people feel so strongly that that drag performers, who present an often sexualised parody of women for adult entertainment, would ever need to interact with children?
[deleted]
The same bill was passed into law here in TN, but it's currently embattled legally.  A judge already put a stay on allowing it to go into effect.
so just having long hair would make me a sex offender even if I have a beard that is crazy.
I’ve always wondered why anyone thinks the US is so free. From the outside it’s a deeply unattractive place, and steadily getting worse. Stay safe.
Okay I've read over this shit and it seems the bill - if I'm reading it correctly and assuming the word ""and"" in law between two criteria/conditions in a legislative document means that both the terms before AND after are required for it to apply... - says that it performances in the nude generally, or cross dressing in the context of...a performance that ""appeals to the prurient interest in sex"" if people under 18 are around or if it's done in a public space one can reasonably assume a minor could see. Now what that means legally speaking - and thankfully it's not just some new string of words in law - is... well

>material appealing to prurient interest as material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts, and defined prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion 

However, of course, this is subjective to some extent. And all the above is simply defining what counts as a ""sexually oriented performance"". More importantly perhaps is that - again if I'm reading the damned law correctly...it's a law prohibiting owners of commercial venues as well as anyone who might be able to authorize these types of performances. And, even with the vagueness of the legal definition above...it seems that ""Drag queen story hour"" would be a stretch-armstrong type reach to prohibit. Further it doesn't seem to say anything about arresting people. Mostly just fines - for business owners or people able to authorize public performances. 

So, if all parties act in good faith and to the law as written, it literally does not prevent you from presenting fem in public. It just states that if you are presenting fem in public...and acting like...sexual in fairly performative ways or just otherwise inappropriate ways then you might have a problem, or in a place of business be asked to stop/leave. So like...don't play grab ass or anything and it \*shouldn't\* be an issue. ... 

Kind of underwhelming as far as these laws go, tbh. A different state iirc is doing a law where if you're a ""male dressing as a female"" you can't even ""monologue"" in public...whatever the hellish fuck THAT means. 

If any legal buffs wanna correct my interpretation of this shite please do so.

My boss, is a very manly cis man, viking looking fella with a huge beard. And he wears black nails. So I guess he's a kid groomer or something ? What a joke this law is.
Jesus Christ America is retarded, can’t wait for the next civil war due to all these retarded decisions
Ok the usa is becoming more and more sensitive than ever
Is it just me, or is it getting crazier out there?
I think organizing marches of trans people and allies in unisex clothing would be perfect.
Idgaf at this rate, if this shit passes in my area and they try to put me in jail for it they are going to have do drag my cold dead body there because, there is absolutely no way I’m not going down without a fight.
I hope the best for you! These people in office are such disgrace! They need to stop worrying about what trans and lgbtq people are doing and worry about bigger issues! LGBTQ DOESN'T DO ANYTHING WRONG!!!! i give you luck 😔🏳‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
Texas? I made a video about all this if you wanna check it out. It targets freedom of speech and freedom of expression in general. This is a terrible bill that if passed will be an attack on most media
That's wild I hope it wont pass cause damn that's sound a lot like a nazi bullshit
This. If it’s not struck down by a court, this is how we end laws like this.
YES!! Malicious compliance FTW!!
I haven't worn jeans in almost a year now (since my egg exploded) leggings ftw 💕✨

Texas
Unfortunately its not just southern states.  I live in a liberal state in the northeast, and my TERF sister in law, who is a self proclaimed ""progressive"", lost her shit when her trans 12 yo kid started talking to me about gender stereotypes and i told them i presented as femme.  Lost. Her. God. Damn. Mind. Literally the conversation involved clothes and nail polish. I would never have guessed in a million years she was so transphobic. But I might as well have been being yelled at by Ron DeSantis.

Point being, unfortunately, while its a minority in most places, many people we would think would be our allies, still hold this sick transphobic bigoted view.
You know cops would turn a blind eye to that cause Jesus
How about female cops wearing pants?  That doesn't sound like it conforms with traditional women's clothing.
Yes report all of the women wearing jeans. Or just anything other than a dress. Then report the men for wearing shorts saying they look effeminate.
Yes. This. Totally this.

Just like someone in Utah turned that state's book-banning law on it's head to demand the Bible be removed from a school
Report any of them that have short hair. Report them for wearing pant suits. Report them for not wearing heels, makeup, jewelry etc. Hell, you could get really petty and report ones with broad shoulders and square jawlines. Menopause can also cause facial hair to grow, report that. Literally anything to abuse this barbaric law.
Okay, yeah, all that, but like. They KNOW these laws will be challenged. That's the goal. They want it to get to higher and higher courts to:

1. Waste time and


2. Give the generally conservative-filled courts a chance to support them officially.
It is the fascist takeover after all the political infrastructure was put in to ban abortion.

Conservatives got involved in their primaries. Conservatives worked locally in the political machinery. Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative states. The most reliably conservative judges were put in at all levels. The Supreme Court was even taken.

The zero-middle ground polices of anti-abortion activists and religious groups built the infrastructure and led to this.

Anything diassproved of by conservative churches will be torn down.
Look up Seven-Mountain Dominionism. It is, unfortunately, not as crazy as it sounds. It’s basically the root of all the anti-abortion, anti-LGBT+, etc. legislative nonsense
Short hand notes… government people (state and federal) are upset at a minority and want to make it impossible to live as said minority or just straight genocide said minority because it’s getting too hard to control and loud to ignore anymore. Some people think it goes against their “religious beliefs” to understand people who are different from them and use their “faith” as a shield to deflect all criticism or wrong doing. Should mention government and religion should be separate entities but they in reality mix way too often in the political affairs of the USA.
They’re turning American into hunger games American, next they’re gonna pick 24 children to fight to the death in an arena /j
First they came for the socialists…
I'll say it again...all the great metal to ever come out of texas isnt even enough to mitigate all the texan shit anymore.

It really REALLY sucks here.
My boss literally makes all the phobic remarks and his favorite band is kiss.

You are our bug out plan if things really go down, we are headed to Portland.
i guarantee that if any of them ever face justice for the atrocities coming, their first excuse will be “most of the deaths were suicides.”
Didn't it say $10,000 each?
“Uh…really transphobic?”
Yes it is sb 12
My post is specifically about sb12, which I thought passed passed, but apparently just passed the Senate and still has to go to the house. However hb4378 is just as bad and disgusting. And we aren't at all out of the woods with sb 12 also. I'm holding out hope tho for a positive result in the house.
This is how those laws get struck down though. Troll them into oblivion.
I want to pass so I'm safe from laws like these.
Ahh, America
There's a problem regarding the little green pieces of paper with dead guys on them. I don't have enough.
This is what they are actually trying to do - get a super majority of legislatures in 35 states to be red by making anyone that could potentially be blue or moderate move to the other states... at that point, they control the entire US because 35 states let's them rewrite the constitution to be whatever they want.
I think we need to start looking into non profits in our states to help our family in other states at this point, much like the Aunty network does for women seeking abortions.
Good. Don’t stop. 

Ever.
Search for Texas SB 12. It passed the senate and is going to the house. [TX SB 12 on LegiScan](https://legiscan.com/TX/bill/SB12/2023)

[Equality Texas’ 2023 Bill Tracker](https://www.equalitytexas.org/legislature/legislative-bill-tracker-2023/) is good for bill summaries.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. They word these things super ambiguously on purpose. They want them to be able to be abused. It accomplishes 2 things. This way, of course most people fall for it, because of course you don't want sexually explicit drag queens dancing in front of kids. The 2ns thing it accomplishes is that it enables any transphobic or homophobic police officer, store manager or even just a regular person, to say they see it as a performance, they see it as drag, etc. And you can catch a lot more people in the net. That's not something that's possible to happen with more specific wording. Go back and look at all the bills republicans have made in recent years. They're ALL worded this way. It's on purpose.
Patriarchal valuation of masculinity and devaluation of femininity.

It’s the same reason why the culture warriors obsess over (especially feminine) gay men more than lesbian women.
Not legally no. But I am in the process currently of getting my name and gender marker changed. Surprisingly easy in this state, it just takes a while for the process. Equally surprising is that Texas is not one of the states in which you have to have had srs in order to change your gender marker. All you need is a court order, which judges in Austin will all too readily and happily give, which is why they are so backlogged, and all you need for that is a letter from a physician. There is no law that says judges have to honor the letter and getting one doesn't guarantee your petition will be accepted, but I've heard of exactly zero cases of anyone getting denied out of Austin, which is why everyone goes there. I'm trying to hurry up and get that done before that changes too.
You don’t have a “strong opinion” on whether any random “free” citizen of a “free country” should be abused & arrested for, literally, just existing in society, while wearing “any 3”  of; clothing, shoes, accessories, makeup, hair &/or nails, that some power-tripping, stick-up-their-“***” puritanical authoritarian “moralist” arbitrarily decided, does not “match their AGAB”?

So, I guess that means you don’t care about equality, freedom, & human rights? Or, at least, not enough to “have a strong opinion”…?
It's Senate bill 12.
Everything I've read said it passed 20-11 but hasn't taken effect yet.
Constantly deconstructing these bill’s tripwire spiderweb, Machiavellian legal language, is exhausting, and decidedly bad for my mental health. So, I’m just going to leave a few quick points for your consideration, regarding how this “law” could be used.

First, understand that those pushing these bills, see any “deviance” from, what THEY CONSIDER to be, normalized cis-het gender presentation, as based purely in ego & sexuality, & therefore serving NO OTHER PURPOSE than “appealing to the prurient interest in sex”, to the presenting individual, & to any other person who happens to see them.

Further, seeing as how they deny that being transgender is a real thing, & that being “trans” is not a “legitimate ontological state of being”. They view ANYTHING, other than “AGAB appropriate presentation”, PURELY as “a PERFORMANCE”. This includes, but is not limited to, walking down the street, engaging in casual conversation, friendly waving to another person… you know what? Just put LITERALLY ANYTHING here, & it would apply.

Honestly, that’s enough. I’m going to stop there.

I hope it helps view the language of this bill in a more illuminated light.
I would rather not see this country descend into civil war over this dumb culture war bullshit. Civil war means our families and friends are now on the menu. No thanks. I’d rather see an amicable split. I grew up in Vicksburg, MS. The losing side never really recovers. Ask me how I know…
Also, report cis women for wearing women’s clothes. They will need to prove they don’t have dicks.

This will not end well for fascists.
It's been said before, it will be said again. Malicious compliance is the greatest tool of a civil activist
Yea but they act likenthwyre straight outta the 60's
I’m an Aussie but from what OP’s said about this law it totally could apply.
It's 2023 we shouldn't have to defend what we wear

And you're delusional to think they won't go that far
And Tennessee. And it’s in the works for Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska (but that one is being filibustered into oblivion), Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 
*sigh*
Yup, plus who do they think they are parading around as a police officer? That's a MAN'S job. /s
No kidding. It's like the republicans haven't seen 80's metal bands before.
Probably only do this if you're positive they're an evil neocon demon. Don't want innocent people who live in these states and don't even support these laws to be hurt just because they're cis and typecast as a boomer Fox News enjoyer.
I'm worried this could backfire.

They might actually make all women wear dresses
Not just jeans, sneakers/trainers too...no more skate shoes, no more running shoes, no more B-Ball shoes

It's high heels and dressy flats from now on.

Malicious Compliance, comrades!
Could I have more info on that ?
Not if we tear them down first.
> Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative and non-conservative states.

FTFY. If you look at Wisconsin, looking at the results from recent state wide ballots, they should have close to 50/50 R and D representation in the legislature, but they don't. Their electoral map is so heavily gerrymandered to weaken Democratic voices and strengthen GOP to where the Republicans have a supermajority in both the house and senate.
Wanting to bring about the end times and make the US a theocracy isn’t the sanest notion in my book, but yes, they have been at it for a long time.

The Dominionists aren’t the only ones involved though. Alliance Defending Freedom, Heritage Foundation, Family Policy Alliance, Focus on the Family, and American College of Pediatrics (not the AAP) have backers from multiple demographics, not just Dominionists. Gotta love the BS in those names though.
Exactly, as time goes on they're just going to keep taking more and more of peoples rights so just because it doesn't affect some people now doesn't mean it won't down the line

People think it's bad now but sooner or later it's going to get a lot worse if this carries on, I mean seriously what's next? Are they going to start not allowing women to work again or maybe they'll start separating places by color again. Because there is literally no end goal here besides people getting more and more power to just take away rights that everyone should have over their own life
Right?! No no no. Men in makeup who perform things I ENJOY are okay. What you enjoy is clearly evil!
That's facepaint, just like GI Joe isn't a Doll, he is an Action Figure
OMG I meant call obsessively in high volume to drive them insane! 😅 how’d I forget this is America?
This has not been passed into law yet!!!
Grew up in Portland and moved to Texas, now sadly in Missouri and my spouse is trans and was just getting brave enough to transition and now…all of this! Enjoy Oregon, visit the falls in Corbett and Ashland! Good luck and we will probably be right behind you :)
$10 civil penalty similar to any other civil infraction such as parking tickets.
“No! I’m Texas!”
I’m so sorry. I’m originally from Texas but I moved out last year. I hope you stay safe babe 💖🫂🫂
Thats fair! I mean same, but im inspired by how radical Sylvia was and how she believed we had the right to be openly queer. I think what she was saying was we shouldn't have to pass to be safe, and at the time ""pass"" meant passing as cishet and assimilate into white cishet society. I mean Sylvia also says ""if you walked down 42nd street and even LOOKED like a f-ggot you were getting arrested."" The point I think she wanted the hate to STOP, not find ways to navigate it and just survive it. She wanted change. She wanted liberation!!!!! Theres an underground documentary about Sylvia on youtube I recommend called ""More than Stonewall"". If you havent listened to the full interview that quote is from I encourage you to!

Edit i see this is getting downvoted. Why downvote our own history? Like yes I want to pass to avoid violence but it doesnt end there, I dont want to quietly pass and leave everything as it is just so the violence hits the nonpassing folks. I want the violence gone. Why downvote that? Very curious if anyone wants to lmk
just learn 2 code, duh
To those downvoted me... I was being sarcastic....
You don’t need tens of thousands of dollars to move, and you can take as long as you need to squirrel away bits of cash here and there. Advising somebody to move doesn’t come with the expectation it can be done immediately and effortlessly. 

I moved cross country for unrelated reasons in 2011. It took a little over a year and a half of scrounging whatever I could from the $8/hour I earned at the time until I had enough to survive a few months without work. It was hard, it was a grueling wait, but it was worth it and I’d do it again without hesitation.
I fear since this witchhunt started, that this is the real reason behind those bills.
This! The solution is to take back liberal majorities or at least get rid of supermajorities in Red States, not to run and let the bigots win. We need to keep up emigration from places like New York and California to progressive cities in the Deep South like Atlanta, Austin, and New Orleans. At the same time, blue states need to make themselves as unattractive as possible to the right wing by implementing progressive policies.
So which four of the current 19 solidly blue state legislatures do you think they're going to try to switch by forcing Democrats out?

Virginia is the only one I could possibly see flipping anytime soon.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. 

Please refer to my other post much longer on this thread going over the law itself. The criteria is not JUST that. Now unless the law doesn't view the word ""And"" between two sections when describing what constitutes the offence itself as binding them together and requiring both to be true. 

This one seems to not be worded the way some other more psychotic bills are worded, strangely enough. Did you read through it and check the definitions and all that jazz?

Furthermore it seems to be targetted towards owners of establishments as well as any person who can authorize a public performance - I assume that to mean someone who's job it is to schedule events like that or give the go-aheads. It doesn't seem to specify anything about the PERFORMER being charged with breach of this law - unless they're also the owner of the establishment I suppose.
Then I strongly recommend you leave the state as soon as you feasibly can. Texas is trying to make lists of trans people with records of name and gender changes; it’s possible the list has already compiled and they’re pretending it needed tweaking.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ken-paxton-list-trans-texans-1234647489/amp/
Ok wow thank you so much
So what does this mean. As a trans man on T, if i was in drag would that be considered legal? But me being masculine and wearing masc clothes would be illegal?
That still doesn't change the fact that the bill isn't targeting individuals on the street, nor even performers themselves, but people who own venues who allow it on their venue, as well as like...public workers who authorize performances in public spaces. 

Not in this bill, at least. 

This does not seem to allow one to be arrested for being trans or even cross dressing.
I don’t know shit bout the us but wouldn’t be surprised if that shit happens
Report cis men for wearing men's clothes. Claim that they are really women who are just trying to make men look bad.
Report any female officers who respond for wearing pants.
transphobic republicans are unironically already doing this tho. in some ways i think this was kind of their goal. i remember hearing about a case in a literal elementary school where they wanted to check all of the little girls to make sure they didn't have dicks. its absolutely insane they can talk about wanting to do this and people support it and don't see the obvious pedophilia but are so brainwashed that they think trans people just existing is pedophilia. its absolutely insane. but i dont think we should be doing what the transphobes have been doing. maybe im wrong, thats just my opinion. idk i guess my point is that transphobes have already called me and other allies the t slur ""because of my jawline"" (in other words because im an ally. im a cis woman btw) and i just dont really see why we would join sides with them in that? i dont know, if someone could explain this to me that would be greatly appreciated, im just trying to understand!
exactly. lots of 100% passing trans people, you want that bulked up dude with a beard and biceps the size of a watermelon, wearing skirts and using the same bathroom as ""our innocent children""? like okay, im transmasc. im not allowed to use the mens room because im biologicalpy female, but (hypothetically) if i was on HRT for 5 years, top surgery, full male presentation... theyd still want me in the womens room?

i think they only hate ""non passing"" trans people because it has nothing to do w being trans because guess what, you cant always tell 😭
Still can't argue that to a judge in 2023.
No judge is going to interpret women wearing pants as women in drag
Tennessee got theirs struck down by the courts
Edit: sorry not struck down but blocked. We shall see how long the block will last.
The Secession States.
The West Virginia bill died in committee and the session is adjourned sine die.
Damn right! Haha
The malicious compliance venom in that was golden…we probably could take it a step further and start saying Y job before sufferage is considered a “MANS” job so no women should be allowed to be x job title. Asumming the law is that ambiguous. Probably not but it would get a good point across if the law is that broad and grasping at straws. I hope we don’t have to do that to make a point but if we must we must.
Which is ironic considering so many have used We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister as a campaign song (or whatever it's called) and yet... have any of them actually looked at Twisted Sister?
You're probably not wrong. They did just make it so women in the  Missouri house can't show their shoulders. I'm sure the Christian right wing would gladly make every woman wear a burka
Eeeep. The Handmaid’s Tale.
Actually, high heels were [originally and more commonly seen on men in cavalry positions](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-high-life-a-history-of-men-in-heels/iQJCgMgwSKV5Kw) \- by traditional conventions, all male soldiers should be wearing high heels. See how the transphobes reckon with that one.
Sure...

Strangely, while they have managed to influence backers from outside of the traditional dominionist fold, all of those organizations were founded on 7M values and by 7M members. Just because they don’t currently claim direct dominionist end goals, that doesn’t mean they aren’t dominionist organizations. They’re all pushing for those seven mountains. Whether the members realize it or not, that’s what their leadership is reaching for.
well there are conservatives talking about taking away womens right to vote....
If they’re allowed to continue unchecked, gay rights and marriage are absolutely next.
Yep still needs to pass house and govenor, but yaknow abbot so just the house really
My wife used to live there and we’ve traveled there many times.
Oh gotcha
“What’s the difference?” 🤷🏼‍♀️
I get frustrated when people say ""just move!"" as if anyone can do it if they work hard enough. You ever considered that maybe the person has family they support? Old/sick relatives, a kid that can't move away from their other parent? Maybe they're sick themselves and can't lose their medical support? They have too much debt to save any spare money? They're underwater on their mortgage and the house won't sell? They work in an industry that can't be relocated? All their spare change goes to supporting someone else who'd be homeless without them? Being in the state they're in literally prevents them from saving money due to the financial hardships created by that state's laws? They can't work because they're disabled?

""Just move, you can do it if you save enough!"" Is ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" rhetoric. I'm glad moving worked for you. It worked for me too. Doesn't work for everyone.
There were some republican state politicians late last year that actually said the goal was to drive all the liberals to blue states so they get a super majority in 35 states.  I can't remember who it was, but there were videos circulating for a few weeks about it.
Austin has tried to fight the state numerous times. Abbot, Paxton, and Patrick have smacked them down multiple times. HISD has been taken over. AISD is next on the retribution list.

Austin will lose. The local liberal tech companies don’t have the stomach to fight. They have shareholders to answer to and shareholders don’t give a damn about a few trans people getting their lives ruined.

Ok, l guess I’m doing this, after all. Let’s go, then…

*I have taken the liberty of adding quotations & parentheses for personal comments, & to aid understanding, & edited out excess legal jargon, not relevant to the point, for ease of digestion.

(From) [Section 1](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604)

(applies to) Performances on; 

PUBLIC PROPERTY, 
(anywhere that is not private property)

on the premises of a commercial enterprise, 
(any business holding whatsoever)

or, in the presence of a child 
(literally anywhere).

So, as to where this can be applied… well, you tell me. Can you think of ANY PLACE where these conditions would fail to be met? (Other than specifically licensed establishments for “adult entertainment”). It’s literally “everywhere” a person could possibly find themselves.

(From) Section 3.

A “sexually oriented performance” means a visual performance that features:

A.(ii) a male performer exhibiting as a female, or a female performer exhibiting as a male, who uses clothing, makeup, or other similar physical markers and who “performs” before an “audience” (2 or more people); or

(B)  appeals to the “prurient interest” in sex.
(Examples of “Prurient Interest”, taken from [LawInsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prurient-interest): 1. ""Prurient interest is an appeal to an unhealthy, abnormal, unwholesome, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in sex."" Id. at 117. 2. Prurient interest could be said to be the lowest common denominator, the assumption being that the material is bound to be sexually arousing to at least someone.)

(b)  A person commits an offense if, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COMPENSATION for the “performance” IS EXPECTED OR RECEIVED, the person engages in a “sexually oriented performance”:

Please take particular note of the language, “A *PERSON* commits an offence if… *THE PERSON* engages in a… performance”

This is regarding the “performer”, being charged with an offence, NOT a business, or property owner. 

Also, PUBLIC PROPERTY is stipulated as an area of effect. Who owns public property? Who are they going to bring an offence against? Themselves, the government? No, of course not. The offence is given to THE INDIVIDUAL “PERFORMER”. This legislation makes it possible to EXTEND the responsibility, for the offence, to property owners, allowing them to be charged/fined/sentenced, AS WELL AS any individual “performers”.

The primary offence is on the “performer”, themselves.

If not specifically codified in this particular bill, believe that other presiding bills have already laid out the legal consequences for the person considered to be the “performer”. I do not have all the specifics off the top of my head, and I don’t have the time to take this explanation further. You will find it, if you look for it. Being able to charge the property owner for an illegal performance, is not possible without the performance having been already made illegal, & consequences & proceedings for the initiating individual already being in existence.

So, combine this information, with my initial response, & begin to see how dangerous & discriminatory this law would be… 🤷🏻‍♀️ Hopefully…?
me neither and I’m gearing up to be able to flee if it happens
We’re mostly just venting and showing the illogic of the bill. The idea is to overwhelm the system with reports against conservative people they have to abandon the law. But I’m reality we know they’ll just ignore these and only prosecute people they know are trans, no matter how many false reports we flood them with.
Yeah it seems like these laws are focused on the vulnerable trans folks still In awkward phases of transition. The right is clueless about how many of us will look like cross-dressers if we dress according who our AGAB.
They're trying to ban men from wearing traditionally women's clothing

With that logic, women wearing traditionally men's othibg should also get in trouble

It's just to maliciously comply with them
No doubt. But a shittonne of reports, considered legitimate according to the vaguely worded law, could potentially get it repealed. It’s been done before.
Most likely long enough that it will be struck down.
What does sine die mean?
Their predecessors from the 80s (and maybe themselves if old enough) were diametrically opposed to using this song or anything else vaguely metal because of the Satanic Panic. And men in 80s metal bands were often made fun of for being ""femme"" or suspected of being gay or just sexual deviants.  The language that we have today to describe gender variance pretty much didn't exist, but take a look at bands like Poison and other glam metal bands (including TS, actually).  These are all cis men who didn't  cross dress outside of performances or videos,  but that slight amount of gender bending style was enough to implode the brains of most of the conservatives back then.  

Tl;Dr I can't fucking believe any of them are using that song for their campaigns.  Dee Snider and whoever else is left of Twisted Sister should sue the fuck out of them.  Ridiculous fucking people. 

Edit: i guess the whole thing where he said to stop playing that song already happened.
Nah because they are so racist that they wouldn't want their wives looking like ""terrorists""
And show them the portrait of Louis XIV (14th) in his red-soled high heels!

I believe it was the Persians(?) who either pioneered the use or at least popularised them for cavalry use, I could be wrong.
Thanks :)
I didn’t know about that law
Oh yeah I really wouldn't be surprised if they start passing laws that don't allow women to work especially considering all of the laws they've been trying to pass banning abortions and allowing forced pregnancies during literally any circumstance and any age
Seriously? I can't say I'm surprised but fucking hell. Do you have a source or anywhere I can read more about this?
I need a source to show my family.
100% agree with you, they are not going to stop if this continues
It will almost certainly pass. There is no doubt in my mind 😞
i understand that. I'll be fighting with you guys until the end tho. stay strong. i know its hard. but they want us dead and we should stay alive even if solely to spite them
absolutely. they dont understand the nuances and facts of it. they know the caricature of a trans person that these right wingers have made up and then decided to blame for everything, subsequently catching real trans people in the crossfire. no we have to deal with the repercussions of some fake radical groomer trans person that they made up who doesn't even exist
I get what this is about but no judge is going to consider pants for women to be traditional mens clothing in 2023.
“Without a day”

It means the session is over for good.
No, you're right, it was first the Persians as far as I know.

My first time seeing a man in heels was with the Swedish band ABBA. ABBA is awesome.
In theory suits should still work. That's only a past-decade sort of thing for the most part. Sure it's been worn before that and it's gained popularity since, but by no means is it traditional
You're missing the broader picture and thus the point. It's not about actually having a judge decide on these, it's about flooding the system with reports to drown out any actual reports submitted by transphobes. They won't have the resources to investigate every single one, at least not in a timely manner.
By their logic they have too but idk

I'm not American so woo
They are.

first man in heels for me was Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like it Hot"""	12hw16y	trans	1692	0.98	2023-04-10 20:59:15
Me and u/Sue_Donymn-n23 met each other and had a wonderful day out! I treated her to coffee and femme clothes. Miss ya already girl. ♡		"Miss ya too hon UwU
You really cheered me up. Especially with that gift you saved for me.
Can't wait for the next time lol ❤️
A great proof of solidarity and friendship. I like this community.
You know that thing people do when they can't articulate their feelings so they just kind of groan or sigh...yeah internal squealing
... is that onion ring
Nice!
Awesome! Sounds fun
Wholesome
I wish I had a friendship like this. :-)
The chosen ones
Peace in the valley—couldn’t happen for a better pair.
This just made my day hahah. Happy for y'all!!!
Enjoy u meal
I need a trans girlfriend
That gift which you lost immediately. Lol
Ngl she's my first trans friend irl. I was so happy she invited me, and she got me the first femme clothes that I actually picked myself. I'm so grateful.
Nobody told you this, but she dropped a bit of the onion ring into her coffee while biting into it 😉
Yes it is.
Who knows, maybe you can find someone in your area that's trans aswell.
Sameee
Ssshhhhhhh 🤐
My trans friends are my strength 💪. Perhaps you will be building a trans circle of friends soon?
I would have dipped the onion ring in the coffee itself if you weren't around.
It adds to the flavor
I love onion ring!!
what happened! 👀
Ooh sis spill the tea, what did you do with that gift 🤫
I'll treat you to some aswell if we ever see each other ♡
Yes! We want to know the story
I gave her a pride flag enamelled pin that I have a matching one off. She lost while we were thrift shopping unfortunately.
Nooo, stop revealing my shame 😭

Ordered a brand new one myself.

But hey, at least now we have a story to tell lol"	vr1wss	trans	1662	0.98	2022-07-04 07:32:14
Just don’t want to be hated but still were clothes I like		"If you can't straight up buy women's clothing, you might be able to look at how women style baggy clothing to make it look cute. Like when girls tie a knot or do something off-the-shoulder on baggy shirts or buttons ups and it's really feminine and pretty. Same thing if you just have a bunch of baggy jeans, you can probably get away with cropping one or two into shorts if you're decent with scissors. Luckily thrift-flipping and tomboyish styles are really common nowadays. Besides that, you could wear dainty jewelry and such, which will be a subtle way to give some feminine flair.
You can always pair women’s jeans with a long t-shirt so people can’t see the feminine design on the back pockets.
I love in texas, I don't pass, I wear what I want, I get hated. But I also meet the coolest most uplifting people ever. So if you're feeling brave one day just know there's people out here on your side.

Also try an oversized shirt tucked into some mid rise fitted jeans. Maybe with some chunky sneakers
Warning, this is mostly about presentation rather than clothing specifically, but I think this could still help. I’ve had to secretly dress femme for *years*, and I’ve found there’s a surprising amount you can do without people thinking anything’s up.

First, nail polish! Blacks and dark blues are usually accepted as okay for men to wear, and give off cool androgynous vibes.

Next, if your school allows it, get your ears pierced! Stud earings are gender neutral but you need to leave them in for a month or two before you can switch them out, meaning when it’s time for you to come out you’ll already have pierced ears ready for the fun dangly sparkly stuff!

Fun fact, many Hollywood actors wear makeup in movies to make their skin look clearer on set, and nobody in the audience notices. I recommend buying foundation and concealer to make your face look more smooth and clear, and bronzer to cover up a beard shadow if you have one by now. You’ll look more feminine but nobody will notice the makeup!

Next up, if you’re up for it, nobody will notice if you wear womens underwear. It might require tucking, which gets rid of bulges when wearing skinny jeans.

Also, try necklaces! Necklaces are always okay in conservative high schools if they have a cross on them. Rings are also okay, but I’m not a big ring fan.

When it comes to shoes, wear checkered vans, or just vans in general. They’re gender neutral and typically the men’s looks almost identical to the women’s.

Shirts are the hardest part of a closeted wardrobe, but I recommend hoodies. They cover your chest well and help mitigate dysphoria. Besides that, you’re stuck when it comes to shirts and hoodies (for now😉).

Lastly, once again not really in clothing territory, shave!!! Your skin will look so much smoother and less manly, and the best part is nobody will notice or care.

I hope this comment helps!
What helps me is that most of my cis girlfriends wear basketball shorts and T shirts all the time so that’s my subtle girl mode in the conservative Central Valley of California
""boyfriend fit"" clothes look like guys clothes but are for women. Jeans there isn't really a difference between to look so nobody would know. Sweatpants are pretty unisex so you could buy and wear womens without anyone knowing.
feminine button ups !!! they tend to be flowier and the buttons r flipped oppisite
Go to r/lesbianfashionadvice and pick out clothes they're getting from the men's department, get those items from either side of the gender aisle depending on comfort

Go to thrift stores and get familiar with the men's vs. women's brands. Look for women's clothing that was mistagged as men's.
High waisted pants/shorts and baggy tops like others here are saying
Another Texan here. Yeah our state government sucks but remember we're a big place with many different attitudes depending on where you are, thus different levels you can dress up. The inner cities of Dallas and Austin are as liberal as any other big city in the country. Same goes to a lesser extent for Houston, San Antonio, and maybe even Fort Worth (wear a cowgirl outfit and you'd probably be fine in the latter lmao). With the suburbs, yeah subtle and baggy clothes would be best. Stay out of rural areas altogether.
Just buy a gun
hi fellow texan

I'm not really sure, but I've seen boys and girls both wear pastel pink hoodies in my area
I'm in Texas and when I want to blend I just wear the same stuff you see other women being comfy in. Athletic shorts are great if your legs are shaved along with a tall semi baggy girls tshirt. If you don't want to wear shorts any wide leg pants work wonders to hide bulges or hairy legs. I have DDs and can absolutely hide them under the right top if I want to.
Skinny jeans is a great one no one knew i was wearing women's jeans
Ok I’m not saying just because you live in texas you’re country. But if you’d like 7 jeans or womens wranglers are good for pants I don’t know much about shirts though😅
Jeans, if you buy women's no one else will know, women's jumpers in neutral colours, tighter clothing, all subtle so only you know.
**F**
I get most of mine online Venus is a good place
Ok so weird thing that worked for me, tights, you can wear them under anything and no one knows unless you’re wearing shorts and they are very euphoric at least for me
i tend to think knitted sweaters can look very feminine! a pink sweater with skinny jeans would be androgynous enough for comfort and (hopefully) average looking enough to not get any negative attention. any jeans realistically work, but i think skinny jeans are considered more stereotypically feminine. flared pants with any T-shirt could be cute too! i am transmasc, so i may not be the best person for advice on this, but i hope one of those suggestions helped :)
I live in Texas, truthfully ever last person I meet and or see doesn't care one way or the other. My job is being around construction all day. I wear nail polish makeup cute tops and shorts or pants with colorful shoes. Be yourself, be free, be as open or subtle as you want.
Im nit sure about others opinions but I always felt like jeans and a unbuttoned plaid button up shirt over a Tshirt was pretty feminine or at least it made me feel like that
I like to wear Target’s Run pants, they are made with a thin breathable stretchy fabric. It’s like a happy marriage of a yoga pant and a jogger. Plus if you got a size smaller…it’s pretty skin tight, while also technically “men’s wear”

I’m an enby and live for the grey area, so I have like 5 pairs, and it’s all I wear.
Scrunchies as hair ties if your hair is long enough
panties!! panties are a great place to start. theyre so incredibly soft
You have a bunch of responses, but as someone who is not out but wears nearly all women's clothes, I feel like I have tips to share lol

First off - you can ""get away"" with pretty much most tops unless there's an outrageously blatant feminine design on it, or it's cropped. Even then you'll maybe get away with it, but it's more remarkable. So mostly just go to town with t-shirts, jumpers, cardigans and hoodies. It does appear feminine/androgynous, if that's a worry, but it also tends to make you look like an androgynous person rather than someone who's transitioning or obviously wearing women's clothes.

Most pants are easy to get away with too - jeans especially are absolutely fine, but most styles of pants are. The only ones that will look out of place are leggings or pleather/leather pants, otherwise just go for whatever fabrics and styles you like. Again, you'll possibly appear feminine or androgynous, but not like someone who wants to be or is transitioning to be a woman.

For shoes, I pretty much exclusively wear runners/trainers. If you want to look feminine, all-white runners are common, cute, and go with pretty much everything.

In terms of actual style choice, lighter and brighter colours are a lot of fun, I wear a lot of pastel blues, pinks, and purples on top. Blue, grey, white/cream jeans are pretty standard but the right choice can blend nice if you match the top and bottom right. I usually favour baggy on top, tight on bottom, but you can kind of play around with it. And I'd say it's fun to step a little outside your comfort zone - you don't need to push yourself to wear high-fashion and runway clothes, but it can be fun to find and work clothing a little outside the norm. Vintage/second hand shops can be really great for this, it's just a matter of developing & trusting your taste and style.
GAP / Old Navy jeans are all unisex, they just sew different labels in them. Most womens pants and tops are pretty unisex. Just don't get the super form fitting style or low necklines. I wore womens running shoes for 6 months before I publicly came out and no one said a thing. You just have to avoid the really obvious pink styling a lot of it has.

Jeans, shoes, baggy tops.
Tying a sweat shirt or flannel around your waist feels kind of like a skirt
Scrunchies are great for gender euphoria
Maybe some oversized clothes in pastel colors? Or other colors like browns, oranges, and yellows. Clothes in boyfriend fit might also work! I'm sorry if these suggestions weren't useful, but good luck on finding a wardrobe! :)
if you can’t explicitly buy women’s clothing, go to thrift shops and look for clothes! thrift store clothes are way easier to pass as unisex :)
Some Shirts are not really noticeable, same with pants and some shorts ,blue jeans especially.
It depends on body type but i started wearing female blazers they look the same as male Blazers but hold a much more feminine shape. Ive even started buying female cuts of traditionally male clothes including T-shirts, button-ups or whatever you you're style it
come to El Paso, I’ve never seen more gay and trans people in my life
Hey there! Floral button up shirts are a great start! Wishing you well, sis :)
High waisted jeans are subtle but they look fire
Just wear the clothes you like I live in Texas too
So I always cut sweaters along the neckline to give a subtle off the shoulder or fem look it doesn't have to be completely of the shoulder it can just show your collar bones it really feminizes  it because men usually don't wear anything like that
Jeans and a hoodie
i live in texas too. fuck the people around here, wear what you want. i literally walk around my neighborhood wearing thigh highs and skirts, idgaf
Basic pajamas with impeccable eyeliner/mascara. Insta-cute but easily concealed with sunglasses.
Joggers
Anywhere pretty much
DM me for specific places if you live in the DFW area since I live there too.
It shouldn't matter what people think it matters what you think and then people are picking on you because the clothes you wear well then they don't matter they're only making fun because you're doing something they want to do
Skirt, dress, whatever you want to wear! 

They can only judge you from a distance, ignore them and be you!
I think a lot of it is helped by how you physically move and act, as well as talk. Then you can pair that with things like tighter jeans and baggier, more colorful t-shirts with feminine symbols or pictures (ex, butterflies, flowers etc). If you want to go even further, earrings and piercings can be something to think about. It’s easily defendable too in this day and age.

Good luck ☺️
Texan here. Capris go down well. Also some simple women's t-shirts that have interesting necklines, sholders, and cuts in the sides that look cute, but are not too obvious
I do too but I mean if I gave to kick Johnny cowboy hat in his bells then goddamit I will
This makes me so sad to see :( but I recommend wearing very neutral clothes. Like slim fitted jeans and a sweater, and some small subtle jewelry like just kind of plain looking jewelry small studs or small hoop earrings. I recommend going for jewellery that's mainly just metal not like gems in it because it's a lot more neutral so you won't get harassed. You can also wear shirts that are I think it's called boat neck they have a wide neckline and it gives sort of an off shoulder look but more subtle and you can wear a tank top underneath so it kinda looks like bra straps but probably no one will suspect anything because it's just layered clothing. 
You could probably just buy women's t-shirts and things too and they'll fit in a way that's feminine without really drawing too much attention. I hope eventually you feel comfortable dressing the way you want though!
I know it can be dangerous in an area like texas but if you can surround yourself with good people that may help.
Honey I live in east Texas and I go out all the time fully dolled up. I've gone literally months with the only issue I've had being someone telling me to grow a beard. Honestly the scariest part imo is your own psyche. I do carry pepper spray at all times just incase but Honestly I am not scared anymore.
I just wear women’s T-shirts around family. They fit different in a way that’s somewhat affirming, but my family thinks it’s just loose and low necked. I got asked “is that in now?” And I said “yeah I guess”
Flowy button ups and bell bottoms🥳
Women's jeans are easy to wear but one really good idea is wearing any kind of t shirt, shirt or jacket designed for women. They have smaller shoulders and it often actually creates the illusion of smaller shoulders. Jackets definitely do this better but a few t shirts of mine do too. 

I'm one of those annoying people who likes to make it obvious by wearing enby and pride flag pans, other pride/gender symbolism and Docs I relaced with white and purple laces to make them the enby colours XD 

But yeah, shaping your body with tighter clothing works and holy fuck, black! Become a goth or punk if you're not already because it gives you an excuse to wear whatever you want and black is slimming as hell if you're not a literal twiglet.
I'm from central Texas as well, dress 100% female...had no issue...some looks that's really it. 1 month HRT today. Good luck.
I like Hawaiian shirts for this. They’re usually soft, comfortable and loose fitting. You can usually get away with wearing a tank or cami, possibly even a sports bra underneath it, and if you leave them untucked you can wear women’s jeans underneath as well. And you can unbutton them if you are alone or in friendly company and they feel like a light cardigan.

And as a bonus you can get cute floral patterns and everyone just thinks you’re a chill person with a tropical vibe. ❤️
There are so many jeans to choose from without that design though? I pretty much exclusively wear women's jeans and refuse to wear anything with a dumb design on it, I still feel like I have a lot of options!
Same! I just wear what I want to wear that day depending on my mood 🤷‍♀️ somedays I'm hyper feminine and other days I just look like a normal girl who left the gym. Athleisure attire is super common amongst women of all ages and it's super comfy.
I'm Texan. I have long hair, pierced ears, and run around with painted nails (right now a lovely purple) even boymode.

Hell I've been complimented on my nails. 

Yeah there's bigots. But most people don't notice and wouldn't care if they did.
Texan here too and I do the same and get mostly positive reactions.   I'm in central Texas,  hbu?
idk whats tucking and at this point Im too afraud to ask...
The only real difference between the mens and womens sweatpants is the pockets.
Like a true American! *eagle screech*
Lmao that won’t go over well when I am still in high school
I just got one, i prefer bows but they're more practical lmao
Exactly this, we need arms to protect ourselves
I exclusively wear leggings and a lot of people don't even notice it.
Yeah but it’s kind of a thing where no one else sees but I know it’s  still there kind of thing. I know it’s not much but it’s something pretty/feminine that I know is there but no one else does
Tucking is a way, like they said, to conceal the penisbulge in skinny jeans. You can look it up on youtube, there are some great tutorials out there. Or Google it. There are many helpful resources on how to hide it.
Did you know that the eagle screech sound is actually from a different bird because the eagle sounds kinda pathetic
Okey, a LARP weapon then
The trans can't be harmed if there armed
Maybe trans ppl arming themselves is what your country needs to see the danger of weapons ans start to regulize them
Good to know!! Thanks
Ahh, gotcha sorry - I thought you meant like all women's jeans had the design, not that you liked having it!
MY LIFE IS A LIE
The bald eagle is a glorified seagull
What a let down lmao. Happy birffday btw
Nah, I should be able to carry a Glock with no permit, just a background check. Gun laws are unconstitutional and are mandated by both sides to try to introduce tyranny. Both sides of the political spectrum are trying to control the populace. Fuck Gun Control.

accidentally passing	"I was in full boy mod to go buy food and despite my absolute lack of feminin clothing or make-up the cashier still interpreted me as a girl (I guess 6 month of HRT is enough to get visible changes) :D

Congrats on the male fail!  

You must be young, I’m 5 months in and look nothing like a woman.
Im 3 years in and finally male failing with more consistency. Most women gender me as female most of the time now while with men it’s still less consistent. Im kind of androgynous still
I remember I started passing before I realized I’m trans. That was an interesting experience but one I am very happy for
Happened to me once.. Until i start talkin
Congrats! It's a great feeling! I'm not even on E yet and I got this a few times recently (until I started talking...). Long hair, painted nails and baggy clothes really do work wonders lol. Oh and a mask definitely does not hurt
Hell yeah!
T’es trop belle, ça me surprend pas. J’espère qu’un jour ça m’arrivera aussi. Bonne chance pour le reste de votre transition💗
Task failed successfully.

Good for you tho!
hell yeah girl! go for it
That’s so awesome!!! Can’t wait to get a bit further into hrt too xd
Same happened to me today too at work. I was helping someone (I work at elderly care) and he has dementia, I'm not passing AT ALL, but still he thought I'm a young man. Damn I was happy :D
Congrats! 🎉 I'm so happy for u 🏳️‍⚧️🥰
Yay!!
It only gets better and better with time
FTM here. The other day, I went to the store with my dad. Super last minute (like, putting on socks and shoes in the car), so I didn't have time to throw on a binder or layer up to hide the obvious bulges on my chest. Got to the store in a t-shirt and basketball shorts, chest area fully on display. Even had a mask on, so any semblance of facial hair was hidden. Get to the register, and the lady checking us out spends the whole time referring to me as 'he' and 'your son' when talking to my dad. So that felt awesome, and was the first proof with my dad present that his line of 'you'll never look like a guy, people will always know' when I first came out was, in fact, bs.
omg this happens w me until i say anything 😭😭 idk how can I change my voice
omg thats so cool! i have a fun passing story too!! i was getting some injections done and even though im afab and the nurse knew that they still gendered me correctly! it made me very happy :\]

&#x200B;

did cause some confusion on the nurses end though
A had a big moment like this late last year (I was about 1.5year on E)  some friends and I were sharing a hotel room and we checked out super early in the morning we were in pjs with messy hair and I had forgot my mask in the car so I had expected to be misgenderd but nope this old lady in small town Texas hit us with the “I hope you lady’s enjoyd your stay” 

It blew my mind, I just a few months prior I was still getting constantly misgendered and here I was read correctly on a day I didn’t even have a bra on.  I guess my body had finally clicked together Because ever sense then I think I’ve gotten misgenderd once? And I live in small town Texas so it’s not like the people here are just being polite
i must say that i love that expression ""male fail"" x)
I'm 20
I’m a year in and don’t even come close to looking femme 😂😂
Only 4 months but same here
Years before transitioning, I was called mam on the phone and it took me back so much, yet I enjoyed it. It’s interesting looking back and realizing stuff like that
Yhea ... I had the same problem, I started working on my voice at home and now I won't say that I have a féminin voice but definitely androgyn
Trans power ! Fuck yhea !
I can tell this is French, but correct me if I'm wrong
comment tu peux savoir si je suis belle \^\^, ?
That is the sweetest form of revenge possibld
I am the same way! But I found a YouTuber that does in depth voice training for MtF. I have their whole string of tutorials and explanations on a watch later playlist for whenever I have free time
I just hate myself atm so quicker get male fail the better off I be and can finally see mirror more kinda avoid em 😭❤
That’s rest great that you can transition at 20, I’m so happy for you.  I’m double your age and had no idea it was even a thing that could be done when I was your age!
i had a sign like that as well once, a friends younger cousin asked if i was a boy or girl since he said that i sounded like a girl (which was before i realized i was trans), and also my friend answered before i did because for some reason i didn’t want to tell him i was a boy
My grandma used to think I was my mom on the phone up until I was like 17.

She thought I was her own daughter. Every single time.

Made me happy but I didn't understand why lmao
No you’re right😂
As-tu oublié les selfies que t’as posté? ;)
Tachen, liebe Leut
can u pls send me the link
To be fair I also got a facial hair removal surgery
Well I certainly can not speak the language to an extent of fluent conversation I did recognise some words from my LOTE class in school which is French
ha tu les as vus et garder en mémoires je suppose
i agree
https://youtube.com/c/TransVoiceLessons

Of course!
What is that?  I’m getting laser, never heard of surgery.
Still, young people have a way better chance at passing (at least MtF) as your features are still fairly soft and clean. Age hardens your look. 

Congrats on the passing, that's totally awesome!
I can't speak most languages but I can generally tell you which is which (for latin-scripts at least and some Cyrillic and of course I recognise traditional/simplified chinese, japanese and korean. )

You can pick up on things like letter frequency, word endings and so forth. I remember the first time I realised Italian was all vowels at the end of words, I was fascinated by it and my teacher didn't get why I was so excited. xD
thank youu
It's the same thing but in France it's called surgery
I lost my hair at 19 and was 6ft 5. I had little chance of passing. (only conventionally speaking of course, women can look however they want)
Wow I did not know that, I guess you are pretty observant
Oh interesting!  I’ve had five sessions so far.  I’m going to need at least five more then electrolysis for white hairs because I’m old.
6'10"" at that age, totally there with you. Speaking though in broad scheme of things. Look at any ""do I pass?"" post and the younger you are the better chance you've got.
Next week is my 4th session, but I only started after I was already 2, month into hrt
oh no I agree in general.
I started a month before HRT and did them four weeks apart in the beginning and now I’m doing them five weeks apart because I’m getting other body parts done too. 

Even though it’s painful, I actually really look forward to the sessions.  You should notice a lot of reduction. After this forth one.  I know I did.  I never liked my beard hair but I didn’t realize quite how much I hated it until I started feeling the relief of seeing it go away.  Laser has been really affirming for me.
For now I'm just doing facial hair, it's mostly berry bearable as a pain except for the upper lip
omg we have similar avatars

This box, which has hidden my girl clothes for nearly a decade, now receives its final mission: Delivering my guy clothes to Goodwill.		"Farewell, Euphoria Box

May you make someone else as happy as you made her
That's sentimental
How poetic.
Love this!!

Many LGBT centers and non-profits have clothing swaps to give trans people a comfortable place to explore and “shop” for clothing. If your city has one, it could be another wonderful place to consider donating old clothes to!
Lol xd
Yay!!!!
Cool! I'm happy for u
So good.
:’)
The two boxes I have for clothes and 1 for makeup will someday make this trip thanks to your inspiration. :)
Someone will be extremely happy with those clothes
Thankfully my wife is supportive.  I have my own special  pink hangers for my girl stuff and section of the dresser and closet.
This makes my heart warm
All the Butch transbians that see this.

o7 I have several bags of old clothes I must part with.
That is great, I’m happy for you 💗💗💗
Living the dream
Proud of you I'm not trans but I appreciate that you are able to live freely being yourself
👏👏👏👏🎉🎉🎉🎉
That is so awesome. Congratulations.
So happy for you!
congrats!  someday i hope to be in the same place
Milestone!  💋
Hell yeah so proud of you
That is truly awesome :)
Good on you!
mine is a red backpack
I’m so happy for you! Congrats girl! ❤️🏳️‍🌈
I had more of an emotional reaction to this sentence describing a box than to 98% of movies I’ve watched.
For me, it was a bag inside my backpack, inside my closet. 

These days, it's spread on my floor and displayed on my dresser.
This is amazing! So happy for you!!!!!
I've had a bag and a Tupperware box thats had my girl clothes and accessories since high-school. I finally have an appointment to find a doctor to start E therapy. I can't wait until I can do something like this, your post gives me hope for the future, thank you <3
So happy for you.
The contents made me happy, but the box was actually super stressful because one snoopy visitor would mean the end of my best kept secret
The *Euphoria Box* transitioned into the *Dysphoria Box!*

OP: Congratulations that have been able to take this step. I and many others wonder if we will ever make this far. Best wishes!
My heat is melting, this is the most adorable comment I’ve ever seen.
The poetic justice of the Euphoria box makes me so happy!
That's a really good idea actually. My ""city"" isn't big enough to have one but I'm willing to bet Kalamazoo does
Yeah. For me it’s the top drawer, but literally 1 thing in it
Thankfully, my mom never goes into the middle drawer under my bed.
Oh God you just described my pre-transition life. Living in my parents' house it was a constant game of ""Hide the girl clothes"".
One of my former roommates had a cat that would venture into my room. I have no idea how the roomie never saw the pile of panties hidden in my closet when looking for her cat...

(we were all super comfortable around each other. ""Invasion of privacy"" wasn't even a thing)
i'm not trans i'm just curious about transtimes and other things like that don't know why thouht. I hope i don't make some people angry, but i have got a question, hum never mind anyway i hope you the best.
Thanks Ɛ>
Tool bag from harbor freight for me
My mom snooped. It wouldn't surprise me if she found it because she used to ask what was in it a lot, especially whenever we'd move. She actually started to open it once when I not-so-smoothly slammed it back shut
My parents found my stash of my mum's girlie clothes I would wear and asked me outright if I liked dressing up in them, needless to say, at 10, I denied it and it was 30 before I admitted to them and came out as a bi cross dresser, to old and still to shy to be a trans, but I still dream even at 50.
A spear gym bag in the back of my closet for me
This makes me so sad. I hope you get to or got to get rid of it.
I thought that said toad bag

I don't know why
Red WalMart Backpack atm.
The back of my closet, trust me it’s a mess you wouldn’t tell unless you cleaned it
""it's your birthday present! Don't ruin the surprise!""
How has your mom been about your transition?
My parents just sent me to a shrink since it was the 1980's and trans people basically didn't exist. Finally came out in my early 40's and life has never been better. It's never too late!
30 ain't too old to transition. Neither is 50!
I work retail and my cynicism is way higher than my believe in people being accepting of me, even with the British accent 🙄. But sorry about the shrink, that I thank the gods I was never subjected to."	i153b7	trans	1609	1.0	2020-07-31 10:16:09
I recently bought myself some clothes, and I'm never taking them off✨		"Why would you, you look fabulous! Keep being yourself. :)
kinda goals tho
You're very pretty. Good luck on your transition. You're so lucky to start so young. Wish I could've started young. BTW do you play those guitars? I'm a guitar player too. Spent most of my life in hiding so I learned the guitar on my own as a tool to deal with my dysphoria...
Geesh you’re gorgeous.
Oh, my god, you're GORGEOUS.

I'm not trans — a 21yo boy — but I've been thinking of trying to dress like this for a long while. Hopefully I'll find the courage sometime.
Holy shit you are so hot 🥵😭
[deleted]
I want them oof me.
I mean you’ll probably want to wash them eventually....
Why is it fair that people can just wear womens clothes 
And look a girl like how 🤔
Too bad you gotta wash them one in a while.
But they'll get dirty and stinky! And clean clothes feel even better!
I just want to compliment you. You look stunning, fresh and innocently sensuous .

Go back to your original gender you fuck face maybe even commit suicide the will definitely help the world
Lol, I totally understand. I have one skirt that I wear more than anything else in my closet. My wife said that I got it and just moved in.
Girl its like them skirt and leggings were made for you!
Yes but I don't play guitar that much, to the right I have my two basses, which is the instrument that I'm studying in college ^^
Oh it's just a regular t-shirt that I tuck inside the skirt:(
[deleted]
Oh very cool.. Well music was definitely my outlet during a time I couldn't come out as transgender, but hopefully you'll never have to deal with transphobic people the way we did back in the 70s when I was a teen... Good luck girl, you're beautiful.
Cute af, you rock it marvelously 🔥🔥

Random “girl” knowledge/social norms to do with as you wish	"Random useless (?) knowledge i have from growing up female (remember rules are for breaking, but its good to know them first…) 
Please note that these are probably culturally influenced and might not be useful, but its all living in my head and i wanted to get it out of there!

Clothing, makeup, fashion….
- It’s illegal (in most countries) to require makeup/heels for a job, but its a socially accepted part of “formal wear” not wearing them is becoming more common now, but that’s not always been the case and some older people might find it weird.
- The most important item of clothing is the underwear, everything else can fit perfectly, but it’ll still look a bit off if the underwear doesn’t fit right… 
- shaving, the reason there’s not a lot of decent female branded shaving foams/creams is because most use conditioner! It moisturises and protects the skin well….
- if you don’t feel comfortable without makeup but want to look natural: bb cream…. (It’s a tinted moisturiser that covers blemishes, has sunscreen and still looks beach ready)
- when trying on clothing, try sitting down in them on the stool/ chair int he proving room, it will help see if a skirt rides up, or if clothing dig in at the tummy 
- tanning…. If the bottle says wear gloves…. Wear gloves! Bottled tan is hard to get right, its better to use a tinted moisturiser, but remember that it builds colour over time….. (or go without because you’re beautiful as you are!)
- its totally normal to ask a friend/colleague what they’re wearing to an event. Most will boil down to “a nice dress” (formal), “jeans and a nice top” (semi formal - note that a T-shirt is never in that category..) or some sort of shorts/skirt and vest/tee combo for summer, beach etc. if going to nightclubs/pubs bring clothes and get ready together, that way you set a tone together for how much/little clothing your group has. You don’t really want to be the person with the least clothing on, because that can get uncomfortable as the night goes on…..(some people can be really creepy when out!) (tip for clubbing, bring flats!)
- if a skirt feels short, you can wear tights, but its a good idea to practice getting out of the car….. (though this is why cycle shorts were invented!) 
- unless you have amazing skin, its not worth buying the cheaper face masks…
- if your work expects formal wear, have a separate pair of black flats/pumps that you keep at the office, then you can travel in whatever….
- there’s a weird stigma around pooping in a public toilet/ a friends house… 


Social 
- a coffee place is a great place to meet friends (and you can often check the website to see what drinks they order if its intimidating, or ask friends what they recommend…)
- always bring wine/ some sort of potted plant/flowers to a dinner party, especially if you don’t know the hosts well…. (Red/white is best)
- acting dumb is often a defence mechanism, but it can backfire. A lot of guys (and even girls) can be intimidated if you have strong opinions and state them bluntly, though many are working against this now! 
- if a date pays for your meal you don’t owe them anything more than a thank you (not even a second date)
- if you’re at a dinner party and don’t feel comfortable/want some time away from people then you can always do the dishes o move over to the kids table (they have better conversations!)
- job interviews - wear some light makeup(even if you don’t normally wear makeup) and try to match something in your outfit to the companies colours (if you know their logo is a certain colour maybe have a scarf of shirt that colour, then they already can picture you working there!)
- many guys get intimidated if a girl can change her own tyre/ put up her own shelf, you can decide if that’s a red flag or not 
- when out, many guys get asked if they have a lighter…. Many girls get asked if they have an aspirin 


As i said, this is just for fun (though id totally appreciate if anyone adds to it or does a “guys rules” one :)"	"This is all super accurate, I'm transmasc but this will *absolutely* help transfems so thank you so much for sharing !!
[deleted]
I'm cis female and didn't knew these things :(
perhaps a reason why I'm always rather a loner/outsider XD

a weird experience i had if you are a woman and don't wear makeup with men is, that they think you are brave for not wearing makeup and start to slander other women for wearing makeup.... it makes me so angry, do they really think that would buy them bonus points or so? I just think makeup is a form of artistic expression and i'm just not into it, but talking badly about other women is a fast way to turn me off of a guy...
Trans'girls': Fuckin' flex with your car maintanence/modification knowledge (if you know it.)

They may accept a trans woman is a woman, but if they're sexist anyways... better sooner than later as OP mentioned.
Thank you so much for this it’ll de my new “bible” 🥰🥰
Love this! This is information that transfem is looking for myself included. I have been looking forever for ""how to be a girl "" that gives the unspoken but yet important guidelines that every woman learns and absorbs through osmosis.  The knowledge of the nuts and bolts that is passed on from one woman to the next. You could successfully sell a how to guide for all of is out here that weren't raised and conditioned in the ways of being a woman in this society. Ty for contributing and i hope you post more suggestions and ideas.
This is so much why does it all have to be so complicated 😩

Seriously though thank you!! I will absorb all of this ☺️
Thanks this was a good read:) You think you could/want to write something about mannerism? Maybe I look the wrong places, but I've found it difficult to find good material for this.
What's a proving room? ;D

Are you Swedish, or at least Scandinavian?
As a transmasc I wish someone had written me this guide when I was still trying to be a girl haha.
I still get nervous when women try to talk to me in a public bathroom.
A huge ""girl"" social norm that ive never seen anyone talk about is talking with your eyes. I've tried to do this with cis men and they never understand for some reason? A lot of girl/afab communication is nonverbal.

It's hard to describe. Imagine something weird is going on to your left but you can't/don't want to draw attention to it. If you lock eyes with someone, briefly look left, and back to who you're communicating with, they should understand that means ""look over there"". Another big one is raising your eyebrows and briefly looking down, it means ""I can't believe this shit"" basically.
I am guessing I am not the only one that feels a bit disgusted at most of the norms here right? Sure some of them are nice and useful like the shaving thing but the rest just give me a very icky feeling, it just screams sexism
>- when trying on clothing, try sitting down in them on the stool/ chair int he proving room, it will help see if a skirt rides up, or if clothing dig in at the tummy

Expanding on this: growing up as a girl, I leaned from friends that you should do the ""squad test"" for certain clothes especially jeans. 
To ensure you would be comfortable and not restricted to move in any way, for pants (especially jeans), put them on in the proving room then squad with them. Keep in mind some jeans will stretch overtime and some don't, you can ask a vendor about this. (Also, ofc, if you are trying to squad in them and you feel resistance from the fabric don't keep doing it or you can rip it).
This have saved me from buying a lote of cute jeans that I could wear while walking around, but I couldn't sit nor lower to the floor with them.
Now I need someone to make a guide for transmascs
*me, madly scribbling notes*
In regards to the pooping in a public toilet. As someone who grew up masc, pooping in public toilets goes both ways. For whatever reason, people find it weird universally. So if you do it don't tell anyone, I guess
Wait... there were rules to being a girl? I've just been living my best life here without much thought about what others think
All useless to me.  I'm a tomboy. 🤷🙄
Is there one of these for mens mannerisms/ social norms that we FTM folks could see? I’m about to go to college and have really no idea how to act like a regular dude
Did not know most other girls use conditioner to shave too! I've been doing it forever but assumed no one else did.
My brain: ""Write that down, write that down!""
I would love to see one for guys or trans masculine enbys!
I'm pre everything mtf myself. I shave my body hair and use moisturizer on my skin, because right now that's all I can do
This is a great resource and really helpful, thanks for posting it!

Not that I intend to follow any of them, granted.
Omg I could totally come up with a mens one if I had more time but the number one “rule” for men that comes to mind is that farting in front of friends is perfectly normal socially accepted behavior
I'm gonna be changing so mamy tires and lighting so many cigs
Ok so I know it's supposed to be like a girl knowledge thread but I saw the thing about dudes asking for lighters and it reminded me this. Trans men learn nod code, nod up if you know the person in more than just name and down nod for every other guy. As a trans girl who was always nodding to people this is still something I have problems not doing and I've been clocked cause of it
No wonder I failed girl-school. Who knew all this shit existed. Being a woman is... too much. Good luck! 💕
What is the cultire you grew up in? Would help to know where these are most applicable; some terminology is unlike that used here
Thanks bro. Saving this post for future reference. I'm autistic so I had to learn the guy rules in the same way as I am learning the girl rules. It's nice when things are written out plain like this :)
Now i know what to follow :D

Thank you for these it really helped :)
:o

This is gold.
This is extremely helpful, thanks my dude :))
Someone should write something like this about male social norms. It would be really useful for us transmasculine folks!
""its totally normal to ask a friend/colleague what they’re wearing to an event""
This was such a revelation to me when my girlfriends let me know about this a few months ago.
A lot of good information! Some of which I knew and some I didn’t, but I do have a question. When it comes to work wear, are pants that come above the ankle acceptable? I’m not talking capri pants, but a bit longer than that. This would be in a customer service type job.
Can you format this better? It is very hard to read.
This is great but the formatting kills my brain.

Something to add:

Standing feed pointed forward or slightly in ward(sometimes called pigeon toed).

Women tend to do this, men end to avoid this.

Learning to take a stance naturally with your feet forward, or slightly canted in ward gives you a significantly more feminine stance. 

This behavior is very commonly pointed out among Japanese women, Celebrities, and fashion as well. Anime has a lot of female characters who are examples of this.

Spreading out and making a bigger presence is a typically masculine presenting behavior, minimizing your stance and space is typically feminine.

This screenshot from Genshin impact: https://i.imgur.com/tXtWJ3I.jpeg

Is a good example of this difference.
for a the shaving one, if you have sensitive skin just using conditioner will kill you, the best shaving cream on the market is CREMO, and the best way to get a softer, longer lasting shave is to use NAIR (hair removal cream) and then shave AFTER because the hair removal cream doesn’t remove all the hair, but it does dissolve the hair down to the skin so it doesn’t grow back as fast.
These social tips are a godsend. Thank you :)
for the bottle tan stuff - yep gloves are a must, but also moisturize dry spots or where there isnt much fat (elbows, knees etc) so it gives even coverage  


Doing your eyebrows right (or getting them done right) is 100% worth it, it will change your face from feminine to masculine or surprised, pretty really easily - worth going to a decent professional for! makes a HUGE difference. Also dyed lashes and brow really saves a ton on makeup and gives you the natural look for weeks :)
Thank you so much for the advice!
Thank you for writing this x
“• if you’re at a dinner party and don’t feel comfortable/want some time away from people then *you can always do the dishes or move over to the kids table* (they have better conversations!)”

Omg fml T_T
I would love if someone could make one of these for transmascs! I am terrified of the future stage when I reach passing, and suddenly all of the social things I do to engage people come off as creepy/desperate because I'm a man. I have no idea about the social cues a man should take to come off friendly and kind rather than thirsty. I'm a naturally good talker and like complimenting people when I think something about them looks good, and I am very afraid of that coming out the wrong way.
The only advice I can give for being a man is to make grunting noises when sitting down or standing up
Same! I agree with these tips! I never followed them half the time and that made it difficult to make friends because I was so ""weird"".
Thankyou, I found this informative and slightly confirming of some social etiquette I have noticed over the years... The last bit about changing the tyre made me giggle... I am a Builder, and learning electrical engineer, been playing with cars since I was a kid, and humbly let guys ""Mansplain"" to me stuff that I can do with my eyes closed, obviously men I've met since starting my transition, old friends still look to me for help... I find this funny more than anything else, and have found it helps people to feel important/useful if they can give their 5 cents of advice.
Asking for pads is kinda common, though many bathrooms have machines and many are switching to more environmentally sound methods (though there’s no harm in carrying them….)

Oh yeah, give compliments freely. If it’s to a guy it’s handy to start it with (I’m not flirting with you, but…)

Where I’m from you’d smile and say hi(then look down/look away so they know it’s not a conversation starting.) I’ve never personally waved at a stranger or had a stranger wave at me - I’d probably panic wondering where and when we met and why I’ve forgotten them! (Though maybe they do that in America? Not sure…)
OMG I can’t not do the single head nod when passing people, and I’ve gotten some strange looks because of it. Darn ingrained habits!
In all my life I have never been asked by a stranger in a public bathroom for sanitary protection. They usually have dispensers for that on the wall, failing that most of us would rather wad up toilet roll as an emergency measure before asking for something from someone else. We don’t discuss periods much with one another really, there are more interesting conversations to have in the bathroom! Btw, many women are using cups or period pants now anyway so hopefully that sort of protection is becoming obsolete now.
Yup women will complement one another on their appearance, shoes being a favourite.
We nod too, and smile and say ‘alright?’ As we pass. Not so different. 
Other things… at gigs I get into the action at the front rather than standing to watch- I’ve learned that I’m less likely to get groped up there. Try and stand against a wall or sit on the tube, again groping is common and when it’s busy it’s impossible to see who is doing it! 
Lastly, I’m a midwife- I see women all the time, there is no such thing as average they are all wonderfully different, do it your way.
I think the asking for pads/tampon thing is a rare occurrence but it does happen. Actually for me it normally happens in a friend/coworker group setting and pretty much never in the bathroom for me. 

Yes, women compliment each other A LOT, especially if they hate each other (if a woman hates you she will compliment you sarcastically, listen to her tone.)

And yes, women smile at each other in passing a lot and sometimes wave a little.
Second the compliments, something I had to learn when I started passing as male is that the way I learned to compliment is how men learn to flirt. I started adding little things that show that Im queer when I compliment anyone I percieve as a woman so they dont assume Im hitting on them
In 12 years of being out, I have never once been asked for, or seen anyone ask for a tampon/pad. I'm sure it \*happens\* but it is not common by any means.

&#x200B;

>Lastly, I have heard that the female equivalent to the   
I'm-passing-by-you single nod of the head that guys do is a smile, and   
maybe a two-shakes-of-the-hand wave.

I've not ever noticed or done that myself
Men think women wear makeup for them and if they just heard a man say 'it alright you don't need to put makeup on you look alright!' they will um something?  They think you would be honored that you are 'perfect the way you are' and think them as some nice guy that will treat them right.

  
But honestly it just really brings out everything and can cover any blemishes nature throws.  No idea why they don't just try makeup themselves, well actually I know they are scared being called gay and losing respect.  Crabs in a bucket every time.
I work on my own car and modify it 🤷‍♀️
I mean, I've changed out turbos and exhausts before and done most of the work on my car myself. That kinda flex might really intimidate some guys and they should be. I have a wrench and I know how to use it ;)
Transbian here. I build race cars wearing my favorite blue panties. 😚
Remember that many rules are made to be broken ;)
Of course, I think it’s only cool to share. I did get worried if I’d get hate for passing on what’s essentially peer pressures….

An interesting book I recently read (that inspired a bit here) is called “rules for my daughter” it written by a father to his daughter and gives tips like how to get red wine out of clothing and a lot of fatherly advice (the one about a date paying from dinner was actually from there)
There’s so many more too! I got worried about it being too long!

My partner said I missed the most important one…. How to poop in a public bathroom
(Basically go when no one’s there, put paper in the bowl to absorb sound (coughing can also help) then spray perfume after 
Some people can’t even pee without running a tap! (Though a tap can also cover other noises)
Mannerisms like moving the body or like etiquette?
A changing room!

I’m not, but have been here for over 3 years now and speak fluent swenglish 😂🫣
omg yes! i thought it was just something you developed when you become good enough friends with someone
It does right!

I’m at t he unpacking stage trying to figure out what’s me and what’s the stuff people put into me (though I’ll admit some of these things I never really did, like fake tan - but it’s easier to get away with those mistakes as a 13 yo that doesn’t need to go to work the next day!)
Yes. It’s very heteronormative. 

The real advice is be yourself. You will be happier when the people around you get to know you and like you for who you really are.
I tried, but it always ends up being bitter and angry.

I learned that I should give advice on something I resent having had to be.
I could write a terrible, terrible guide for transmascs and it would still mockingly cover what some real cis men do.
I literally have no idea what would be in it. Most of the things that are expected of guys is pretty bad and shouldn't be emulated.
Umm 

Basically men have piss poor standards.  Take note men can give compliments and do do that but don't over do it.  You can say 'oh got new shoes looks nice' but don't overload it and also say nice shirt, pants and so on.  Can say nice outfit but don't overload.  Try to keep it rarish.

Clothes, some have no concept of style others will be dressed to the nines.  Varies on person to person.  Formal wear though?  Ehh whatever formal pants and button shirt at least.  Super professional though?  Like lawyer or executive or a weeding?  You bring out the suit then, it really just a heavy jacket but whatever.  Also men don't take purses, that is social sucicde for many.  You can do a fannypack, backpack, or just get some man-purse-thing, more a knapsack on a string or whatever.  No men use pockets for everything.  Run out?  That why you have a jacket, more pockets!  Oh and take note men do not like wearing short shorts, good chance at the beans and sausage making a debut. 

Take note that it totally varies on guy to guy, and by that I mean if you show a bulge you going to be called a pervert, not the funny one more the your a rapist one.  Now as a transman obviously you won't have that issue till bottom surgery but try to keep any erection discreet, it considered shameful to show it to all.  

Other note I have to say men typically don't give a shit about showing their chest, this is social.  If lucky with A and under breasts you MIGHT be able to bullshit it through.  Men chests are not pure flat and they can get a lot of muscle in their chest area.  That said otherwise only fat men have breasts worth nothing but typically they are C or smaller.  For ass, ehh it all about the dam same.  Some men like baggy clothes to hide erections and their own ass cheeks others like showing them off YMMV.

Men don't have to be assertive they can be just timid and don't have to initiate everything but you will be sometimes expected to so be prepared if they push you to.

Men are usually pretty emotional, via violence and aggression, and anger, and force.  I think the T does it.  They will look at you funny if you go stotic on them.  Men sometimes like horsing around and but varies per group.

Oh and this through a transfem eye so might be corrupted to hell.  I ll be honest, men and women act just about the same, it just society shaped them to do various things due to the inertia of history.
Yeah that’s why I marked it as possibly triggering - feel free to ignore them :)

It’s just stuff I noticed by trying, and often failing, to fit in (and studying a lot of sociology)
Bring hard liquor instead of wine
Be funny most of the time, take things lightly, handing out compliments to either genders *can* come off as weird, minimum physical contact, lots of guys find it weird to hug too, have an open body pose, contrary to belief men rarely talk about sex too, and it can be weird to bring up.

Sorry if this was very based, I'm mtf for a good reason.
Following….
Would love to see that!
•""Yes, I will [task] for beer.""
• address everyone as ""dude/bro/mate/pal"", tends to change based on your location.
• never under any circumstances speak to strangers in a restroom.
• you'll probably need to learn and watch some sports.
• just fist bump when you say hey


I never successfully lived as a guy, probably could have came up with some other things to help you pass in college otherwise,  everything else from that time in my life probably doesn't apply anymore
Same
In some groups not doing so would be seen as weird
Thank you!!!
In the U.K. with influences from American and Australian tv and a Cosmo subscription - my work experience was all from the U.K. though when talking about work clothes (I think we dress pretty formally there since we have school uniforms…)

I did notice that I used a word that doesn’t exist (proving room) since I moved to Scandinavia a few years back - but I didn’t want to edit on my mobile in case I accidentally deleted or something)
Depends on the workplace
I was receptionist for a place that cared a lot about reputation and I’d have felt okey to wear 3/4 or longer, though only in black/grey/white and only if I’d shaved my legs and had the right shoes (though this was a company that really cared!) 
My tip is to dress formally the first week and see what others are wearing, adjusting as you go. That is unless you saw on the company’s homepage/Facebook or at interview that they dress pretty informally. 

Though I’d say in 100% of reception/secretary work I’ve done it would have been ok (though not in labs or places it can be a health risk) for teachers, doctors, etc then it should be ok, as those tend to be a little less formal.
Again remember all I’m saying is just from personal experience and a desperate need to “look like a girl” and reading cosmo growing up…..
(Also is mostly based on the uk)
I can try, I wrote it in one sitting at like 10pm
No worries :)
Same!!!!
Ah yes, the most masculine trait... fatigue and back pain. Thank you!
And if something looks a bad idea and could lead to an injury, but will look really cool, and totally impress that girl... Do it! But Seriously jokes, don't do what Johnny don't does.
[removed]
""Ah Hyeh""
Also got one that’s a bit more widely known, if you’re walking past someone and want to acknowledge them, nod upward to people you know, downward to strangers. Toss in an eyebrow raise to seem more cheerful
They don’t wave where I am in America—as you said, it would make me think I know the person. Just a smile and a duck/nod of the head suffices. I like to say a quick “pardon me” if I’m squeezing past
[deleted]
""Asking for pads is kinda common""

???????????????????? no it's not? like what do you mean by common? Most people on their periods will usually carry some spare tampons or pads around for the day because they know they'll need to change throughout the day. Surely having something (literally anything) is a true life saver but I don't think in the past 7 years of openly using women's restrooms that I've ever been asked for one. Who knows, maybe I just have an ""I don't carry tampons"" kind of face?
It took a while but I’ve almost stopped now lol it hurts inside when I do it now 😢
Its been 1.5yrs on T and Im still reminding myself to switch from smiling nodding. We'll both get there eventually
It's always so funny reading about people who did the head nod thing before lol. All of my masc friends do it but when I was growing up and pretending to be a boy, I just.. never caught on?.. and always did the smile/hi/look away thing..? And now it makes sense why so many people thought I was particular lol; I can't imagine doing that.
Honestly, complimenting has been an interesting change with HRT. Since well before the Testosterone always made complimenting feel a weirdly sexual exercise even if I was trying really hard to be genuine. And now the compliments are coming out easily and differently. Yes I am a lesbian now and still attracted to women, but when I notice a woman now it's a much more complete picture?

Fuck this is hard to explain but with testosterone I feel like I'd notice attractive woman first and then the rest would come into focus. On estrogen I am more like ooh that is a really cute outfit and I love your vibe type of deal. It's more definitely a clarity of perception, wherein I am still able to see attractiveness, but it's not the first thing I notice nor is it the biggest thing anymore. 

The other thing that probably complicated everything pre-HRT was gender envy that seemed to be getting particularly bad near cracking my egg. Getting crushes was waaaay too easy and near the end it felt like I had a crush on literally every woman around me. Once I cracked and all those crushes went away with the realization that it was gender envy was super relieving. 

And yup all of this contributed to being easier to compliment. Pre-crack I still wanted to be part of the complimenting women do with each other so I really focused on how my gay friends would compliment girls and copied that really closely. It was nice but felt way too much of effort just to be able to take part in a simple social ritual. 

Funny how such a small thing just made me really introspective.
Yeah before transitioning, being desperate to be a part of the little social rituals that indicated a particular gender, I made sure to mentally study really hard how all my gay friends complimented women. I started copying that, putting in a ""oh my god, i just looove xyz, where'd you get it"" formula. I wanted to indicate I am genuine and not flirting, give the compliment, and ask for info about it to show that I'm not interested in the person physically and that it's a compliment.

I dunno if other people need this much planning to make sure things hit the social mark. But transitioning is making things easier and I just wanted to say nice things to people before and post transition but didn't want to be creepy.
i don't know, perhaps they have emotional problems with makeup? like i don't fully understand myself tbh why i struggle so much with makeup :/
like i had a phase were i bought a lot of it but still couldn't use it somehow, like i feel weird using it...
also like i don't particularly like looking into the mirror or doing selfies :/
perhaps they have similiar selfesteem issues?
i mean perhaps it's my weight that makes it difficult for me, but i don't know....
makes online dating also difficult because people always want selfies etc -_- i rather send them some custom sketches or so tbh
Theres more??? Its taken me so long to learn what i know oh my god my mind is melting. 

Thank you for the advice but my honest plan is to never use a public bathroom ever again. 

If you have more id love to hear though even at the expense of my brain deteriorating ☺️
I'd rather deal with the smell than have an allergy attack due to perfume. I hate when people spray it to cover bathroom smells. It's a bathroom not a rose garden.
Please feel free to spell them all out. Cis girl, cultural studies major here, I don't notice them at all because well, they don't go against my nature (only the ""be cute and nice and small"" ones do) but I'd really like to see them all and have a good think about it...
Okay the pooping thing is gonna be annoying.  Whyyyy is just a bodily function
I would personally love to hear some etiquettes as I only know about male ettiquitte from fancy dinner stuff to everyday things like holding doors open etc.
Both would be neat really\^\^ If it's possible of course. It's just every time I've tried looking this up my search results gets drowned in ""how to seduce men with your body language"" stuff. Not what Im looking for
More like mannerisms of cis guys rather than “tough alpha guy”
I fit in by sheer will alone. It's why they call me the Babu yaga
I prefer beer. 😉

But honestly, I quit drinking for the time being.  Was just amplifying my dysphoria. 🤷
Also for the bottom one girls get asked for aspirin, tissues, or menstrual products
Yep, you’re welcome
I'm only 16 and I already have backpains. I hate being tall
Lmao same
Careful with “pardon me” if you go to the UK, I was told it is only said when you break wind in public. Could be true or not, but I switched to “excuse me”. Just in case.
Same, I use reusables and would rather go without than ask (though I guess if I was wearing white….) also I’m probably ftm and avoid meeting people in “women” spaces if I can…
It might be a cultural thing? In my experience, older people are not as open about menstruation and tampons or other similar things. 

In Brazil, growing up as a girl, I have had the situation of people asking for tampons a couple times a year. I wouldn't call it an often event, but happens. 
My grandma and people her age were not as open about this things. 

Even as an adult, I have had people asking. Some people don't plan and sometimes stress and other situations can make a cyclw starts early than people though.
Same, took some work to train it mostly out of me and I cringe inside when I still do it
It probably just you getting comfortable enough to express yourself.
No men just hate wearing makeup because it seen as feminie, they don't want to do what girls do.  That said some go against the grain or they wear... whatever it called men products.
Lol I wouldn’t even know where to start, there’s a lot of rules around clothing etc that aren’t worth learning (since the rule book there is pretty much being thrown out the window these days!) 

one my mum always said was when planning an outfit that you can show legs or chest (she said boobs or butt) but not both… 
One I always followed (and kind of still do…) is that if you are in doubt about an outfit, if it’s a but brighter or more revealing than you’re used to, try a cardigan or a wrap with it, it can help tone it down and if you get uncomfortable later it’s a good fallback (the downside is that you might end up carrying it all the time)

The butt/boob rule can also apply to makeup, decide in advance what the focal point of the face should be (normally eyes/mouth) then put most of the attention there with colour/technique - the other should complement, but not compete 

As said though, these are kinda just extras and not everyone follows them (or even knows them!)
Oh there is so fucking much. I'm a cis girl and talking to my girl friends we find so many things that we all do. 

Also I study cultural studies and a few weeks ago we were talking about gendered expectations and collecting examples. We were all on empathy and strength and stuff and then our professor said ""well we all know manspreading, but how do women sit? Crossing your legs is the typical *I uncross my legs because I feel called out * but even with north feet on the grounds you tend to Corsa them and push them under your chair *I proceed to take my feet out from under my seat and do what I thought was a me position * but yeah, correct, miss ..., that one with the knees together and the heels leaned into the legs of the chair is also pretty typical."" I gave up. 

Basically what I'm trying to say is that life is full of these social rules. There is no way around them but seeing them spelled out seems like a lot. I'd say you're best of with some girl friends (cis or trans that have been transitioning socially for quite a while) and have them tell you when you don't behave according to girl code. I bet it's less than you thought but the ""mistakes"" that are there are really wiered little things that you wouldn't even notice
I never use perfume, but it lead to stomach issues cause I just never poop when I’m out….
With etiquette its tough cause a lot are quite old fashioned and people are not really following them as much but here’s the ones i can think of or that’s not as toxic….

If visiting someone’s house for the first time its common to compliment the house, like wait until you’ve had enough time to realistically see more than just the door then say “I love what you’ve done with the place” or “oh wow you have really good style!” A lot of people especially AFAB get a lot of pressure on how nice/styled/clean their houses are and there’s. High chance that they cleaned for you coming over. (There’s also a high chance it will look very well cleaned and they’ll reply with “really, its such a mess today!”, despite cleaning for you’re arrival….)

In a restaurant there’s not really any remaining napkin etiquette, although traditionally the napkin would go in the lap and then placed on the plate (if paper) or beside it (if fabric)

Going with friends to the bathroom is really common, just remember that anyone can be in the stalls so its common to mayb check if you’re really alone before talking deep personal things if your friend is upset and crying.
If a friend is upset and crying its nice to offer a tissue. If they call you crying ask if they just wanna talk or if they want you to come over/FaceTime (if the distance is too long) normally they wont want to meet up, but the offer is nice.

If you’re getting bad vibes from someone a friend is dancing with/ flirting with you can try to get them alone (maybe you need help with your outfit or something) then ask if they’re ok or want to leave….

If you wat to give someone feedback on their outfit there’s a 10 minute rule…. You can recommend changes that can be fixed within 10 minutes or less - if they have something on their outfit that can easily be washed, or something in their teeth, sure tell them (often with close friends there’s actually in unspoken obligation to tell them!) but if the issue ant be fixed within 10 minutes (they’re out and their outfit shows their underwear or their makeup looks bad but they can’t fix it) don’t tell them, it’d only make them feel paranoid and uncomfortable and could ruin their day.

Anything following the words “no offence but…” is seen as being deliberately offensive and harmful…

However any sort of criticism or feedback should follow a compliment “you know i love you, but when you say….. i feel…..” or “you’re so great at your job, but you’d be even better if you just….”


As said a lot of these can be really toxic, so take them with a pinch of salt :)
I did just write an etiquette one now :)

Body language would be tough, there’s a lot of things drilled in from a young age (sitting with legs closed/crossed) taking up little space…. Talking with hand gestures and nodding to show that you’re listening, having a relaxed (but happy) face…. Honestly a lot of it is pretty toxic….  There’s a toxic requirement for girls/women to look happy an docile for fear of being called a Karen or having resting b face (i personally always had a resting emo face and got a looooot of criticisms!)
I guess online it would be having good grammar, but using emojis, excess punctuation etc

When talking there’s more of a melody to the voice, talking monotone is pretty uncommon (again i learned that by being “wrong”) It’s hard to explain that online, but can be picked up by listening to enough women talking or watching a lot (!) of high school dramas on tv
That applies to your average cis guy as well. From a young age, it is quite literally beaten into male presenting people that crying isn't okay. This is so normal for guys, that in response for me getting beat up, **a teacher** told my parents ""your son cried in class, of course he's going to get beat up by the other kids"".

You're also not allowed to be shy or unconfident otherwise you'll get ignored by everyone at best and at worse, people will try to trigger your enxiety so they can mock you. You can't really opt out of these experience during your formative years so it doesn't matter if you want to be a ""manly alpha male"" or not.
I’m not tall and have back pain
Good to know. I don’t like to say excuse me because customers think it means I want to talk to them.
Woah thats so smart though. I feel like that makes so much sense. Im feeling it on a deeper level idk it makes sense to my fashion sense but i dont know why it seems right? Thank you so much. Have a wonderful day!!! (My brain is melting less than i thought it would!!)

I had to upvote for the magic 69 number
Please note this was in 1932 Berlin…. 

I don’t know if there are a lot of history buffs here, but the following years in German history saw some pretty major changes to the treatment of convicted criminals and people considered homosexuals.
I hope she had a lovely, flawless transition
Like they were going to willingly allow her to purchase it
I don't think it takes a history buff to know what happened in Germany in the 1930's
in the 1930s?
Not a reason to break laws
it's not exactly obscure history at this point
I knowww, I was just joshing with the “history buffs” comment, since it’s like one of the parts of history everyone knows about. 💙 But rest of the comment was serious. I hope she got through alright…
Transitioning was already possible in the 1930s. It wasn't nearly as common, or involved as it can be today, but trans folks were taking hormones then, too, to change their bodies.

**Be gay do crime**
the institute was erased 1933. Passing became a matter of life and death aswell. I don't think many people who didn't pass perfectly had a great transition in Germany after 1933, especially with a criminal record

Whose side are you on? 💀
Im not rly on a side, i agree with some things from both sides although i lean towards supporting lgbtq, i hate lawbreaking a lot however
I wonder what other laws she might have broken in 1930s Germany? Do you hate the lawbreaking that saves people from genocide?
jee i wonder why she broke the law! let me just go ahead and not analyse this any further and give a completely nonhelpful blanket statement instead! /s"	12mes5u	trans	1503	0.99	2023-04-14 21:49:03

Wow! The amount of Trans envy i have rn is through the roof! ❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
Cute!
I think you look great in either outfit.

In fashion terms I think the skirt looks better. The way I've come to understand it is that if you wear something short on the top and the bottom it tends to concentrate your look into the middle. But if you wear one short piece and one long piece it tends to elongate your body.

That's at least my very inexpert opinion.
So freaking adorable!!!
😍😍😍😍
Smoken
You look amazing!!!
SLAY!!
You look great! They fit you very well :)
first two are my favorite <3 such a good color on you.
I love them too! My favorite are the first 2, the last one is more a comfy fit for staying at home !
I have so many friends that have good taste in clothes but I’m not out to them ahah
Tbh this isn’t really a friend, it’s the girlfriend of one of my closest friends.

But yeah with people like that I wish I could just tell them 😭
Thanks 😊
Ty😊
😳
Thanks ! I think I’ll buy one that looks just like this it’s so pretty!
Tysm OwO
Thanks 🙏
Thanks for the kind comment !
Thanks 😊
That green-ish skirt is really great, when she showed it to me yesterday I definitely thought « I want to wear it » !
Thnks 😄
What’s that ? Are those the shorts ? Thanks !
Hiiii ! Thanks 😊
Ty!
❤️❤️❤️
Thanks 🥰🥰
Yea ! If only I could ask her 😭 she got the dress a few days ago so I can’t steal it from her since she would definitely notice !
Thanks ❤️
The dress is so lovely I like it a lot too !
Working 🫠
A blouse would sure look great, sadly my shoulder are quite wide so I think it’d be hard to find any that fits :(
Thank you very much !
Thank you ^^
Tyyy
Glad you like it 😊
Thaaaaanks🥰🥰
Thanks I like it too ! This and the last are my favourite !
Right !? I felt like Lara Croft ahah thanks !
They’re a short size, EU 38 while I’m supposed to wear 42/44 ahah that’s the trick
Thanks ! I’ve been growing them for 3 and a half year now :)
What’s that ?
Thanks 😊
Oh thank you !
Right ?! 🥰
You’re so kind ! Thxxx
9 ! Did I win ? :D
I love it too ! I wonder where she bought it ahah
Thanks for the compliment 🥺
Thank you !
Thank you so much 😊 my hair are one of the few thing I love about me
Thanks !
Ohh I wanna see that 😊
Thanks :)
Ahhh 🥰 thx!!!
Ty 👉👈
Thanks that’s so nice from you 🥰
I’m not sure what that is but thanks 😊
Really ?! I’m glad 😄
Thanks !
Thanks 😊 
That’s great because I’m already quite tall so I’ll look like a giant ahah
Thanks!!
Thanks 😊
Same ! I love it !
Idk, I think it looks really good and is nice for going out
Why don't you?
Ohh I understand and relate. Still am yet to tell some of my close friends who I'm sure are fine with it, but it's just so difficult. Wishing you all the best 🤗
You are very welcome.
both the skirt and the shorts, they look nice on you when they show the bellybutton!! 💕💕
Maybe I could come see you 👉👈✨️
I have really wide shoulders too. Another idea is Lane Bryant or Torrid. Their close are for more plus size girls, but they have some more shoulder room and both stores are SUPER trans friendly.
I gotchu girl. 

Any blouses that resemble this one would look the cutest with that skirt.

[Sleeveless Sheer Blouse](https://www.maurices.com/product/winona-button-down-tank-top/152720?camp=PLA%7CORG%7CGOOG%7CPRODUCT)

Idk why that one comes up that dark nude color but if you can find one in white it would be chefs kiss!
Nicely done
A belly button piercing it's super cute.
You are welcome!! Con mucho gusto princesa! 😘
Almost 😅🤣
Of course!!!! I feel like if you can’t find it anywhere, you could always get a white tank top and go to a fabric store like joanne’s or something and find an iron on cherry patch and DIY it!!
Your welcome!!
Aww don’t mention it 😎
❤️❤️❤️❤️
Gosh I wish I could go out with that but I had to give back the dress I borrowed (without authorisation :D)
Kind of hard, most of my female friends are more acquaintances than friends, they are friends of friends, I’m not that close to them that I can tell them.
Thanks ! You too :)
 Oooh i see thanks for clarifying ! I too like that a lot !
I have insecurities about my love handles and thought that I could never rock an outfit with a crop top.. turns out i can ! Big win today 😎
uwu
Ah it’s kinda far to go in store for me but I note that :)
I see ! And do I need to tuck it into the skirt ? Wouldn’t the sleeveless factor make my shoulder stand out more ? 
I think I could also pair a similar dress with a white bodysuit or just a simple t-shirt, what do you think ?

I hope you find the courage to take the first step. I remember the first few times I went out. It was so liberating.
I’d tuck it yes! You could even pair it with like a thin belt. The sleeveless factor should help minimize your shoulders, of course all tops will be different though!

White bodysuit sounds cute too!
Most def
Ahah if only I knew where to buy it, she got it at a thrift shop :(
Sure, but there is no point in telling them, and also it could even be « dangerous » since if they connect the dots and notice I’ve been borrowing some of their clothes, I could lose friendship with some of my friends ! So, I’d rather keep that for my closest friends from now :)
Oh sorry I meant the USA are far ! I’m in Europe :)
I already went out some times in the past, not in my hometown for obvious reasons, but it was really nice, finally feeling fully myself
Oh yeah a belt and a small bag would look cute ! 
Thanks for those advices I’ll take notes and try to replicate what you told me ❤️
I guess you are from the US?
Why're you not out publicly though?
Ahhh.  I understand completely. ;) I’m so glad!
Just girls helping girls! Not sure if you know of Monster High but the cherry top gives me total Ghoulia Yelps vibes
I’m not! I’m from somewhere in Europe :)
Mostly because I’m still questioning, and also because I’m afraid of changes. I’m still living at my parents house, my mother know and is supportive but I can’t tell my father (I know he’d react poorly)
Also I’m afraid of losing some friends, and putting difficulties in my simple life (at work mostly)
I know I shouldn’t care and just put myself first.. but I can’t wrap my head around that idea
I don’t ! I looked it up and I love the style, I agree that these looks alike :D
I am also from Europe, I am from Germany xD
I hope you can reach that place soon.
I saw it on ASOS but it’s out of stock :(
Thanks 😊 it’s hard but I’m having therapy since December so I hope to come clear asap !
😭😭😭😭, but I think there a a lot of outfits you would look really good in. So heads up xD
❤️❤️
Ahhhhh thanks 😭😭
I always try to post picture of outfit I like, so I’ll try !"	w7knab	trans	1502	0.98	2022-07-25 09:45:08
How do you enter a women's clothing store?	"Oh god, spare me from this.





Edit: yes nobody cared, i secured the objective successfully."	"Usually through the front door, but each to their own
Dont sweat it, your mind plays tricks on you thinking 'oh gods everyone knows' but realistically no one is paying any attention and if they are, they would just assume the clothes are for a female relative / friend 

Trust me, people are too caught up in their own lives to gauge what others are doing :) 

you got this x
Kool-aide style “OH YEAH!”
Confidently. Not a joke answer, just act like you belong and nobody will question you (and you do belong anyways!), regardless of how far along transition you are.
One foot after the other
Go with a female friend? Go androgynous/ wear girliest clothes you have or can that you feel comfortable in. Then walk in. I clomped on with size 10 cowgirl boots skinny jeans and t shirt. The staff will help. I felt like a guy in a dress my first few times really nervous, obvious af trans but all the women flocked to help me. They don't care! Third time shopping 🛍️ I was feeling better. Now I even joke with them while trying stuff on. Still don't pass and don't care much more feminine now though.
You probably are tired of hearing this, because the anxiety is real and can be overwhelming regardless. But it's true that almost nobody cares except us. It took me a bit to be able to get the courage to shop, but as soon as I walked in to browse the racks, not a single other woman even looked at me funny, and I was entirely boy moding. Unless you're acting creepy, the assumption from most is that you're shopping for someone else. But I have reached a point of having zero F's to give anymore, so when a clerk asks, I'll be honest that it's for me. Rather than acting shocked, it usually results in them giving better advice on fit or color knowing it's for the person in front of them and they can better help. 

I have struggled with anxiety for years, and this new experience of transitioning can be massively daunting. But if you are able, I encourage you to just put yourself out there and tell yourself before going in, that nobody will care, and clerks will be helpful. In 90% of the cases I've seen or heard from others, this will be true. Good luck!!!
Kick the door down, FEROCIOUSLY DAB AT THE FIRST PERSON YOU SEE, AND SCREAM.

""I HAVE RETURNED, YOUVE BEEN EXPECTING ME HAVENT YOU?""
Like you belong because you do.

Staff don't care... Really it's a paycheck for them and money for the store that pays them.

It's hard to do it, I know it's difficult and you feel strange.
I still think everyone is looking at me and judging and that I'll be the talk of the day afterwards.
But here's the thing.... No one and I mean NO ONE I know has ever mentioned to me anything about seeing certain people in clothing stores.... Literally it's not a thing.. I figure if I've never heard of it then it probably never happens.

My own experience is probably quite different to you, as I am Cis (probably) and like to dress fem. But you belong in any store. 

Hell people go in to buy clothes for themselves, as gifts, to browse for stuff. Anyone can enter.
I specifically look for places with LGBTQIA+ staff. 
I walked into Dangerfield today in full boy mode and bought a purse, looking around the store I don't think a single one of the staff were straight. 

If I can't do that and REALLY want something from a place that's super cis/het staffed I take a cis girlfriend and get a ""gay friend"" pass to go into the  change rooms with her. 

Then there's online, but I only do that for really cheap things or place that have completely free cash back returns including shipping. 

But the BEST shopping experiences by far is going anywhere I want in full girl mode with a mask on. I pretend I'm hard of hearing and type messages on my phone's notepad app to talk. Not healthy, I'm sure it's a crappy tactic that most people see right through. But it makes me feel good and no one is about to rip off my mask Scooby-Doo style and exlaim "" *gasp!* Old man dead name!""
Do you have any friends who could maybe accompany you? 💕
You might find a place that has both guys and girls sections and wander around the whole place, like you’re just looking to see if anything catches your eye. 

I work retail in a fairly conservative area and am a trans guy. We regularly have cis men shopping through the Women’s section and cis women shopping through the mens sections. I’ve had masculine presenting people ask me to build feminine outfits for them. 

Last night, we styled a guys mannequin in girls clothes because my cishet coworker thought it would look nice! She said, “who gives a fuck about gender norms anymore??” And she was right!! He looked so good in his pink joggers!

I think you’re absolutely safe and fine to go in and shop. And ask questions if you feel comfortable doing so. Personally, I love helping trans people find comfortable clothes for themselves for the first time. We have at least 3 regulars who are trans women and the whole staff loves helping them find clothes/ build outfits. 

So, go get your clothes, girl! It’s going to be okay!!
Trans-portation!
strut it
I've found out that nobody actually cares. The customers want to buy and the store wants to sell. That's it. I know it can be difficult at the beginning.  


Something that helped me a lot was to buy my first outfits online. It does not feel weird to shop for more women's clothes when you are already dressed like that...however, it's purely psychological because no one cares.
\>i secured the objective successfully

improvise. adapt. overcome
Back a few months ago when I was a severe alcoholic I’d get super drunk and go with my friends. They were kind of embarrassed but I loved it and I’m surprised they went with me
Best without looking around and checking if someone will throw you out (cause no one will but people might stare at you trying to figure out why you're looking so guilty and shady). Eyes front, be confident about this, nobody will take any interest in you (and if they will it's cause they want to check who is this hot person who just walked in)
Chrome or Firefox
When I was newly out, I'd go shopping with my wife only... and we were in one store, and I was whispering to my wife about *""what it the shoes don't fit""* and the cashier must have had an idea, or heard something.... she said to head into the dressing rooms, she'll close them up, and start bringing me selections or EVERYTHING.... ended up leaving with some seriously cute shit... and I have forever lost my fear of *MY* section in the store...
Front door
Congrats on overcoming your fears 💜

I dunno if this game helps people or makes their anxiety worse. I thought it was a good concept though.

https://tessl.itch.io/kril

Your goal is to go and buy clothes as a freshly out, but not presenting, trans woman. The health bar is your anxiety level.
Left foot, right foot, breathe.
I walk through the front door. They say hello.
Am I 100% passable? No. But people treat me with respect at the stores I choose to shop at, or i would turn around.
Depends on my plan.

Sometimes through the front door if security is light.

Sometimes you need to wait till nightflass and get in through the vents.
I want to make the joke that ""all clothes are unisex if you're not a coward"" but I'm gonna give some legit advice here:  


I work in a clothing store, pretty well-known branch in the UK, and I'm mostly assigned to the fitting rooms because apparently I'm a good deterrent to shoplifters.

I can *not* tell you just how many femme folk buy from the ""men's"" section and how many masc folk buy from the ""women's"" section. People in the fitting rooms *constantly* bring in clothes from a section that transphobes would throw a tantrum over them being in, and so far I have not heard a single member of staff complain or judge them for it... and in the fitting rooms at least, we *do* give support and advice if you're wanting to try something on but you're not sure about the style or whatever. You'll be surprised just how supportive the staff because to be entirely honest with you *we don't care*. Some might have personal beliefs that say you shouldn't be there, but they won't act on them because actively preventing customers from buying things hurts company margins and reputation.

&#x200B;

I know that's a very apathetic and capitalistic response but its the truth, nobody working there will care... heck, if you're a regular they might actually start helping you coordinate your outfits if you'd like.
Through the window!!
And then back out the window from embarrassment 
Though it gives me the opportunity to get a look at the window sales
Not the window
Like no one is watching. You are going shopping just like you would in any other store. If people have issues with that, that’s a them problem. Try not to let what other people may think stop you from living your best life
It’s really annoying, they always have these really heavy metal doors that you have to push upwards and then there’s this awful beeping sound that plays while you’re inside the store.... ugh

At least there’s usually not a lot of people and the prices are a steal!
Walk in with confidence
r/actlikeyoubelong.   I just walk in.. the stuff i buy will be mine. But i also used events like Christmas, valentines or Looking for a ""birthday day gift"" and go in to womens shops in boy mode.. But now especially with the covid mask i can go anywhere as me and as long as I don't speek much the ruse is ok lol. also i will often go with frends because its fun.
*kicks the door open* oh god wrong store I’m sorry…
I still have trouble going into to them tooooooooooooooo
Trans guy here, so I have the opposite experience. I know my sizes, and what I'm looking for (unless it's a pleasure shop at the few favorite stores of mine who still have a local physical store). I also try not to ask for help from the staff.
I put on some piece of loosely femme-identified clothing or jewelry (like my earrings or tiara) and just go in. If anyone wants to give me shit about being trans, I'll let them be the ones to be dicks about it.
There was this “what would you do?” Show about a trans woman who went into a women’s clothing store and would harassed by another actress pretending to be transphobic. Literally 9/10 of the customers stood up for the trans woman.
Sadly having a girlfriend makes this a lot easier
[deleted]
haha i wolud love to be like a girl and brows clothes and stuff. but my anxiery wolud fucking murder me
Congrats on your success! 🏅
I don't because I don't want to make other people uncomfortable
With fucking pride! Be yourself babes and if anyone looks at you weird or says shit they are at fault not you. 😊
You got this. The first time is terrifying. But nobody cares.

As an experiment walk into the men's section of a clothing store. Count the ratio of females to males. On any given day there will be more females. Point is gender boundaries aren't as impenetrable as we may imagine.

Feel free to go where you want.
I personally like to walk in the front door. At first it's nerve-wracking but gets easier with time. Start at places like Wal Mart or target. Then when it's easier, clothing department stores like macy's, jc Penney,... When you're at peak performance: lane bryant, torrid, or a local boutique. And don't be afraid to lie and says it's for gf, wife or significant other. Pro tip if you use the wife line get a cheap wedding band! Most of all have fun!
I drive my car through the front window, obviously.
Spinning wildly with your arms outstretched, singing “the hills are alive with the sound of music” - this is the most inconspicuous approach, I’ve found.
Not a women's store, but I go to goodwill with my cis partner and just pretend I'm bored and follow her around while secretly looking at all dem dope skirts... Eventually I will level up to openly shopping for women's clothes while simultaneously wearing them, but... Confidence is built over time...
You will work up courage until it feels natural to go but in the beginning I went with other women for support.
No one's mentioned Teleportation yet? Or having your TARDIS materialise in the changing rooms?

Or via a web browser. (As not a lot of women's clothing stores near me carry ""plus"" sizes (I'm a UK size 28 in somethings, 30 in others),  I have to do pretty much all my clothes shopping online at the moment).

Well done you for making it! Get anything nice?
I kinda assume they just want money and don't care what's in my pants.
You walk in like you fucking own the place
God I remember my first few times trying to get clothes. I don’t think I’ve ever been so red and probably looked like I was stealing lmao. It helps to have a girl friend with you and just give her your cash or card
I feel the same way about shopping for mens clothing. I'm afraid of transphobia and queerphobia. Rationally, I know those things exist in many other places too and that if there's an issue, I can say I'm shopping for a friend/relative/costume. But it can still be weird.
Yay well done on your update! Also keep going even for a look, each time builds confidence. I'm nearly first name basis with the shops in my small town. Definitely a regular. Scored a really nice bra yesterday  lol casual as. First one I bought online way too scared lol
I recently did my legal name change, social security card changed (still have the same SSN) and went to the DMV to get my driver's license updated. No one cared at any of these places, and everyone was completely professional. When the time comes to get these documents updated, it's absolutely no problem!
Go through the door look for xyz, try xyz on, and buy xyz if you want it. 😋 

Jokes aside it can be hard going in the first time and you may be very anxious/shy but heres what you will learn the more you shop in clothing stores. Most of the employees wont even remember you or even care they just show up to get paid and will probably forget your face when you leave. If you're afraid of someone saying xyz have a response ready and say something like ""How does fabric decide who can wear it"" and etc, or just ignore them, or you can constantly have them repeat themselves and they realize how ridiculous they sound. I will say all though I have a million responses ready to fire at any who says something shitty I've never had to use any and I live in Oklahoma. The most that may happen is that you may get a few eww looks but you can always look back at them, look at their shoes/fit and give them the the fuck are you wearing look back at them and they won't bother you. But I've only had to do that like twice in 2 years of shopping in clothing/thift stores whilst still looking like a guy thats carrying a bunch of dresses into the dressing room. 

After you shop for feminine clothes you will have one more hurdle to jump over if you haven't already and thats wearing the clothes out in public. But really it's the same thing no one cares what you wear and most that may have some problem with it will keep their mouth shut. Honestly most of the time I ever see people being openly transphobic is at lgbt festivals cause there's usually the protesters that had nothing better to do. That doesn't mean that you wont face someone being transphobic in public I have had a few cases where it's happen but thats why its nice to have plan. I've had a customer at work look at my name tag and say is your name really Viktoria with the eww face and I just said yeah I spell it with a k and my girlfriend likes it and then they seen I didn't give a shit and left. 

Thats my experience but everyone's is different as long as you feel safe doing xyz in your situation do it you may have some shy/anxiety here and there as you start being more open.
Preferably on legs. And if You don't pass just go in pretending it's for a gf or wife or something like that. You can even act dumb and ask for stuff that You don't know to help someone pick a well suited and good looking stuff. Because like as a amab You probably have wide shoulders which means You should pick things that don't call attention to it to look more feminine, or You'll look a bit weird... Some women have that problem. So You could ask what would look better that way.
i just imagine i’m buying it for a girlfriend or sister and then i don’t care. my nails def give away that it’s for me when i’m checking out though lol
By walking, and not acting like you feel you don’t belong.

I’ve gone shopping in Victoria’s Secret before for my wife.  No fucks given, bought lingerie and bras, acted like I was buying a video game from a store or a suit from somewhere.  

Basically, normal.  If you look and act shifty, *then* you stick out like a sore thumb.  I can always spot those uncomfortable in a sex shop or similar places, they’re the ones that look like they want to disappear
I'm cis (here for my kid who is trans), I worked in clothing stores for a few years a while ago (Old Navy and the Gap). To me, it did not matter what the person looked like when they came in the store or which section they would go to. It was plausible and normal for cis men to be in the store to shop for their wife, or cis women there to shop for their husband. 

If you feel like you don't match the gender of the clothing store or section you are in, it's not going to look off or weird or funny to anyone. And if anyone does say anything they're a jerk honestly. 

I'm glad you had a successful shopping day!
Oh wow, an actual women's clothing store and not a store that has other products in close range of the women's clothing so you can pretend to be spacing out in the aisle and then quickly run into the bras section, grab what you want, and quickly dash for the self checkout? You are brave!

Hugs, dear. It gets better. Someday you'll be laughing at yourself like I'm laughing at my former self now. Glad you completed the objective!
Shopping for woman’s clothing dressed in woman’s clothing makes it SO much easier.. 

Trust me.
I don't, they make me uncomfortable to even look inside. Instead I go to thrift shops and sports stores.
Since the jokes are out of the way, I'm gonna go serious here with my own experience that might help.

When I first came out, my (at the time) wife took me shopping for women's clothes (I was scared af). She did much of the shopping and we pretended we were looking for clothes for my sisters birthday or w.e. She would mention things about it as we shopped loud enough that people nearby could hear her to help ease my mind. She'd ask if I thought my sister would like this, and I'd suggest things I thought she would like too. Shed mention anytime we wanted to size something that I was the same size and to let her hold it up to me so we could guess if we thought it would fit. The great part is, I could look as uncomfortable as I wanted in that moment, cuz any dude would be just as uncomfortable in that situation as I was. At the time I thought 'omg they all know!' But looking back, no one payed us a second glance. Looking awkward and uncomfortable shopping for women's clothes in boy mode was as easy as pretending to be a cis man in the same position 😅 

I truly hope this helps
There are plenty of cis men buying clothes there for their partners, so literally: nobody will care, don’t worry!!!
Everyone says just go in. Now I don’t mind perusing womens clothes but if I’m gonna buy something, I would like to know it fits first, and when I went to the change rooms I basically hid the dress I wanted to try on under a shirt and the guy standing by the fitting rooms asked me if I had a friend who was gonna try that on and I said yes and he said I must go to the woman’s fitting room, because the “friend” would not be on the mans section. 

I was just like screw it and bought it without trying it on and it was slightly too small. 

Point is I just wish it was easier to just be me.
I definitely get why are you asking this. I still struggle with this because I'm scared as hell of people by default (not a big fan of being with more than 5 person's at the same time or hugs). In my case at first I had to ask my female friends to go with me to different stores so I can gain confidence in myself and also see how is everything. For example, here in Spain, in Bershka the times I entered they are really nice and definitely know when someone wants help or wants to try to keep low XD. Other example (which at this moment is still the best experience I had) is Hunkemoller which is a lingerie shop, they are REALLY REALLY nice and help a lot; hell the first time I bought a bra there I was like super super nevours but they helped me, let me try different models and also give advice about what clothes use with that and what bottoms could combine with that bra I bought (also also the first thing they did were apologize for treating me as a man).

Nowadays I still have a little fear but I'm definitely more confident so I think that you should definitely dare :D
Crab walk
Order online lol
You can come to the wholesale supplier [eebuy](https://eebuy.com/) to try to buy, this website is very good
Calm and collected 😌

No matter whether you're in boy or girl mode - buying women's clothes is allowed and **nobody really cares**. While the majority will be cis women, but there will also be boyfriends, husbands, brothers, fathers and boy friends - men are not banned from these spaces. If you want to try the clothes on I'd make sure to do it in a non bigoted store but that's the most of your worries.

Will it still be scary? Yep 😔. But it gets easier with time. Btw it doesn't matter how well you pass, the first few times out as your preferred gender will likely be very scary. If it helps you can have friends come along.
i dont know either but online shopping exists and it totally saved my insecure ass lol
Can I jump on this thread for some related advice? ❤️ 

My teenager recently came out as MTF, and I took her to the store to buy some clothes. She doesn’t want to be out at school yet, so we were looking both for some things she could wear to school to feel good about herself but that weren’t screaming feminine and stuff for home or whenever she felt more comfortable looking more feminine. 

But it was hard because I didn’t know her size. She didn’t know her size. Things that were meant for teenage girls were often cut in a way that didn’t compliment her body right now or were too revealing for what she wanted. She’s not fashion savvy AT ALL and had never cared about clothes before. 

I wanted to ask one of the salespeople to help who I was pretty sure was gay, but I was just getting that vibe, and I didn’t want to assume, and what would a gay guy necessarily know about dressing a trans girl anyway! 

Any suggestions? We were planning a trip to NYC anyway, so I thought that would be the perfect place to find some help if I could find some really LGBTQ+ friendly stores.

It’s not that I thought anyone would be rude to us. They weren’t. It was just that we literally had no idea where to start.

I simply do not.
Ngl I bought a hoodie with a very obvious trans flag (in the shape of a heart) online and wore it my very first time going in one. Figured everyone was gonna think I was some creep in there, so I'd just turn into the skid and let them know right from the get-go that I'm in there for an actual reason.

Ultimately I ended up in a very sweet but very uncomfortable conversation with the girl at the register, but at least she was supportive and affirming

I try casually otherwise people think there's something off
Speak “friend” and enter
If you're nervous, you can try going with a friend, or going extra early on a weekday when the store isn't so busy. That helps me a lot.
enter through the door. and if anyone gives you a weird look, make sure to give them a weirder look
A molotov cocktail through the front window tends to work best when you want a spicy entrance.

Find another trans person to accompany you. Bonus points if they have the same birth sex as the store.

As an AFAB trans guy, I love using all the useless fashion knowledge that was given to me as a young child to help my beautiful trans girlfriends find the right clothes.

Bonus tip, if you are AMAB and look like a  ""gay best friend"" to Cis/Hetro people, most store clerks won't bat an eye if you go in a dressing room with female clothes, especially if you are ""accompanying female friends and giving fashion advice"" - then you can go in try on all the dresses your heart desires without the financial burden of buying them. Also, keep an eye on refund policies, if you feel safer buying online, trying on, then returning if it doesn't fit then that is 100% valid.
I don’t because I usually still wear boys clothing
Sideways crab walk. Assert dominance.
Through the front door. Lol
with confidence!
Confidently
Walk in, go straight to a member of staff and ask for their help, if you know your size, great, if not, get them to guestimate, then go and try stuff on in the changing room or make sure keeping a receipt can mean returning stuff.  Also try stores with ladies and gents clothing, here we got tkmaxx and the likes. These are big stores. No-one truly cares. Go buy some outfits.

Like I own the place, that's how I enter

This is not understood fully enough in general and by the trans community specifically. Most people are only paying attention to themselves first, people who affect them second and everybody else is fleeting entertainment for the hamster on the wheel.

The exceptions are Karens who have a deep seated need to control everything and everybody else's business is their business.
The sales staff just see you as another customer and someone who might spend $ there.
My therapist referred to this as the ""imaginary audience."" I struggled with thinking that everyone was starting at me, while in reality, no one gives a hoot. My mind was literally imagining all these people staring at me. Easier said than done to get over it (still struggle with it), but nice to have a term to affiliate it with.
Yeah.  I get ""extra attention"" when I shop at Lane Bryant for my wife.  However, I wonder of they would be freaked out if I took something to go try on.
Preferably in the cool-aide outfit or holding a jug of it
Laughed way too hard at this 😂😂🤣🤣
Size 10? Luckeeeeeee
The point about “rather than be shocked, they usually have advice about fit or color” is so right! I’m a retail clerk and that’s EXACTLY it. I asked a trans woman who the bralette she was buying was for and she nervously said, “Me, but I’m worried about the size” and we were able to get her a comfortable fit and a color that looked nice with her skin tone!
I entered a makeup shop last day and  a women look at me weird but when i moved i realised i was just covering the stall she was searching for ups
my daughter has sever anxiety issues and sometimes isn't able to leave the house at times, and shopping tends to be overwhelming for her. I do a bit of her shopping for her what can't be done online or from her mom. Make a list, ask for help when/if you need it and don't care what others think no matter what you are picking out is a mood let me tell you. I felt so awkward the first few times but honestly it helped me get over my awkwardness and some of my anxiety about going into stores and asking for help. 

&#x200B;

TL;DR go with someone supportive if you can, if not the more you do it the easier it becomes.
And when they try to kick you out you scream





ARE YOU APPROACHING ME??!?!?!1!1? Do a t-pose while you say this, it works wonders i confirm
this is the way
this. never in my life have I started a conversation by describing someone I saw... shopping for clothes. I don't think I have a single memory of anyone ""remarkable"" shopping for clothes in my memory bank either. if I'm in a store, I'm trying to make out what size fits me and what materials something is made of, not other shoppers!
Thank you so much for your encouragement i don't know if i have the social skill or the boldness to ask for help but going to a shop with clothes of both genders felt very safe and the cashier didn't bat an eye so it was all smooth sailing




Thanks for sharing <3
I love this comment the jokes about walking through the door are getting a bit old already xD
As i don't have a credit card i was dressing male but they didn't care either on my zone at least its 100% safe :)
I think they will be surprised to see my long hair not really how hot i am but hey! Definitely not worrisome attention 



thanks for the tip
I'll definitely give a try brb with my review thanks!
They definitely treat you well or they don't care at all wich is good too!



 Thanks for sharing <3
Ah... Capitalism a blessing in disguise from time to time, thanks a lot for the advice maybe next time I'll try to ask the staff :)
Definitely true, thanks for the advice
It definitely is fun, i hope mask don't go out of style by the time i pass sounds like a blessing in disguise
*Kicks the door*





Aaaaaah! My heart can't take this,*leaves*






^this is literally me xD
Sameee, it was a bliss knowing my sizes speed run through the shop and run. I can't wait to pass and look through my options well though
You tell them girl! I will take cover for know but i really want to spit on anyone who will tell my im wrong >:(
I feel humanity can be saved when i hear this things... Do you happen to have the clip? I would love to watch
Sadly? That sounds positive xD, yet another reason to meet that SO
Truthful, but i don't understand the part where you will order someone to buy your clothes, can you tell me why you mom asks you? I feel like its so nice to go on a shopping spree if you can help it of course
Well but you truly are drowning a drop of water! No body cares i asure you, if you feel uncomfortable go mid week when not many persons will be buying and go get them girl! <3
Thanks *:flush:*
Other people’s ignorance is what makes them uncomfortable (if they notice you at all). You can’t make other people feel a certain way. It is their choice how to feel.
I recommend you go mid week if that's your worry, there wasn't a single soul when i went today, the few who were didn't really care so i might go at a ""normal hour"" if i need
Ma'am yes ma'am! I will make sure to tell how they shouldn't have been born and how their friends despise every second they have to talk to them if anyone says me something
The day i went there wasn't a soul so the ratio was 0:0 hahaha, very convinient i didn't have to deal with anyone it was very nice
I went to shop at a shops with both men and women clothing and it truly went well.




I actually can't wait to go to some local boutiques i have seen so much cute stuff i want to try!



Thanks a lot for the advice!
When I go to goodwill alone with my trans self, I spread out possibilities (plus a few duds, just in case, so I for-sure have some to put back) on a rack, then take photos.  Then I usually stand around and meal plan, text the GF about dinner or work, or chat with my friends, while also thinking and looking at the photos.

After I... *checks notes* After I 'get that text from the person that I'm shopping for', I put the duds and the ones I decided against back on the rack.

Make sure to grab plenty of stuff and not think too hard as you're pulling them down.  Remember, you aren't picking clothes to buy.  You're ""just grabbing anything about this colour/length/size"", like the person you're remote shopping for asked.  The actual thinking/deciding happens when you stand around.

It works for me.
I got full set, didn't have much money so i took one of everything, tights, panties, a cute shirt and a pair of shorts. I think im going to exchange the shirt for something even more girly i like it but i still find myself wanting more probably a blouse. 




The shorts will love to be an skirt too but i can use them as pijama and they are very confy so i think im just keeping it and buying a skirt



Thanks for the suggestion, size guide was truly a blessing everything fitted well i was very happy!
This ruthless capitalist! Madge
Hahaha, thanks for sharing i wasn't as nervous as i thought I'll be but i definitely walk pass the shop twice before deciding to enter xD




I have to find some people, who are down to come i think it will be fun to discuss style choices!
Definitely weird! But it was well worth and practice makes perfect as they say :)
Thanks for sharing, i definitely want to look more through the shops but honestly online is much preferable to me with all the models wearing the clothes




Probably will change mh opinion if i could sneak into the changing room :,)
That's very nice to hear honestly i feel they are probably used to it, how many people change their name who aren't trans? Food for thought i guess
Thanks for sharing your story, wearing on public is a hurdle i didn't thought about jumping when i was buying, but i have a quiet feeling it will be alright
My general understanding is that i should wear ""normal"" tops and flashy bottoms wich honestly sounds incredible, as  i want a collection of flashy tights
An acceptable disadvantage of having your nails painted, and it's not like many people will be present enough to connect it depends on the who is attending you that day i guess xD
Well shit, i always want to dissappear thanks to all the embarrassing memories of my childhood i guess i stick out like a sore tumb :,)



/s
Definitely! I actually saw a man last day i went to the makeup store i didn't thought much of it either
Definitely glad too and thanks for cheering me <3
Because they know and quickly lend you a hand?




Kinda hard to pull that off the first time though xD
Whaaaaaat!? Women clothing is so cute! Sinner!
Yes i was just mortified my sister *had to* tell me to buy this xD, thanks a lot for the story, i was staring at the phone a lot  to check sizes as it will be hard for me to get in to a fitting room so it probably looked like i was checking the list of things to buy hahaha
[removed]
I didn't even try, i know i can exchange it if it doesn't fit so i just quickly pay it once i had everything, a bit annoying if it doesn't fit but definitely a lot less awkward
Hey! Yo soy de la inquisición española! Te vienes a hablar en discord? :)
I used the sizing guide and one of those measuring tapes to know my sizes. 



After that it was smooth sailing because im going to stay closeted for a while so i just took the clothes i thought will look best on me. I knew they will fit me decently so i just grab them and try them at home





I have seen some guides and as i passed make puberty my shoulders are broad its good to attract attention to your legs ratehr than your chest as far as i understood




To go in cover to school I'll recommended tight jeans and girly or unisex shirt, maybe even some fancy neckled shirt will make her more confortable i can't really say



What i can for sure say is that you should post this question! Here it got lost and im sure many will love to help <3 thanks for being awesome
Some really nice tips here, i personally panicked when i got close to the store and decided to check on a bookstore till i felt my heart was ready and it went completely fine. 





I will advice against asking the staff if you don't live in a safe zone in my country they will happily help but i guess it might be dangerous for some people
Ahahaha, there really is no need unless you wanted to use the fitting rooms that might be harder to pull off :,)



Thanks for your story <3
Im lone wolf >:), or well i don't really have friends wich is the same thing ahahaha.





But it was very easy to buy yes, and truly no body cared 




Thanks for sharing <3
Oh this will be easy! i saw how the ukrainians make them and i heard they mixed some foam to make it napalm.




Truly a great way to enter
I have to see if there is a trans community in my town, this sounds so lovely. The return policy is very soft 30 days to take it back so thankfully i don't really feel pressured to enter in the fitting room :,)




Thanks a lot for sharing
Truly no body cares, but i don't know if i want to talk to the staff :,) is not only that i don't pass its also that im poor i will feel bad to ask them :,)
I'm trying to figure how accurate im actually being, like how tight should the tape be around my waist? Hmm...
Sadly is a very big commercial complex so to enter through the roof I'll to enter another shop :,)
Me, finding something cute that actually fits me ""yippee ki-yay, motherfuckers!""
I prefer to rapel in wearing a full body harness so that I never actually touch the floor..... though it does make shopping more difficult
We'll unload the van. We'll get a bite to eat. We'll come back about 9:00. This way it's dark then

Wait this isn't Kevin McCallister's house
the ac/DC duc/k's is ssdid' this is they're thag is blocked.
This is one of my preferred methods.  Followed by (of course) asking if they are open as I’m standing in the store🤷‍♀️
It avoids embarrassment...
I know that nobody cares, but I know that I care that somebody might care.

Oh how the mental gymnastics play out when dealing with the anxiety.
I like to remember a video I saw in a psychology class. 

As a demonstration, another psychology class had some cameras set up in the classroom, ostensibly for remote learners but actually so this test could be recorded. Then, a young man enters the room mid-lecture, looks around awkwardly, then snatches the professor's laptop bag off the table and runs off. Afterwards, they interview several students, including one who actually jumped up and chased the thief down the hall, and ask them to describe the perpetrator.

No two descriptions matched. A lot of students didn't even get the hair or clothing color right. Even the guy who gave chase didn't provide an accurate description.

Apart from being a solid condemnation on eyewitness testimony, I feel it also shows just how _little_ other people are paying attention to you. You can literally commit a crime right in front of them and there's a good chance their mental image of you is a faceless blob.
So true the lady quickly grabbed what i wanted and asked me if i wanted to enter a fidelity program, i will say yes next time for sure xD, i love that shop!

Indeed lol. What size are you? Good news is estrogen can help shrink feet
That's been my experience every time. Thank you for being a wonderful person!
So I've made a few comments about working in a retail shop and I think the only concern I have about buying femme stuff is that if anyone *is* going to judge me then I have to deal with them most days after that.
You can also research and find trans-friendly establishments. For example, Torrid has a 0 tolerance policy on transphobia, Old Navy has ungendered fitting rooms for a reason (and has cute stuff that's usually cheap and/or on sale), and as for makeup, Sephora is super inclusive to the point that before the pandemic hit one of their hands-on free classes was called Bold Beauty for the Transgender Community (they're still doing them virtually until the pandemic ends).
Lol, our brains tell us we're being stared at in a bad way for being trans, but I like to tell myself it's because I'm so beautiful. Is it true? Nope. But it usually works.
I have spoken
I have two people I recognise. One is a little old lady and its mostly because she has a very distinctive voice and is always talkative to the fitting room staff (including me). Second is a nonbinary person who I met on a dating app, who I saw in my shop the day after, and only then did I realise that they had been in a dozen times before and I'd actually served them on tills.

Shop staff do recognise regulars but its normally only after we've had an actual interaction with them or they've made themselves distinctive in personality and *not* appearance.

Similar experience I had in my cinema was a woman who had just moved into town and was asking a lot of questions about our deals and stuff. She had surgery on one eye and so always requested that her seat be on the left side of the cinema so she could see the film comfortably. Literally the only reason we remember her is because she had a specific requirement from us and came in quite often.
Haha I’m glad you like it 😊 
Jokes aside, I subscribe to the “fake-it-till-you-make-it” school of thought. The first time I went into TJ Maxx to buy a purse I walked in like I was a celebrity and joked around with the sales ladies like we were old friends. I love attention though, and I live in a pretty safe place for queer folks, so I wouldn’t recommend the strategy for everyone, but I wanted my first shopping trip to be a fun memory and it is! 🛍 👜 🎉

That's Great!
This... Is... Brilliant...
Yay! Sounds like a cute outfit! 

Well done again ❤️

I understand wanting “even more girly”, so far most of my women’s clothes have been pretty plain, but I just ordered myself a hoodie with flowers on the sleeves and I can’t wait for it to arrive!
Don't tell anyone but I'm an undercover Socialist.
Yes! I'm glad it went well!

One day, I'll go to a suit store and try on suits. Hopefully I can find a friend who wants to go with me. I think that would be a lot more fun.
Go on and screw anyone who has a problem with it!
And if You don't feel comfortable, just put pants over thighs.
No lol, you just look like you belong there! 

And trust me I know, I shopped for womens clothes for years before coming out and it was always anxiety inducing. Now that I’m out it’s so easy and simple it’s actually hilarious how much it drove me crazy
I agree, it can be super cute, but the spaces that specifically sell them feel so awkward to go in. Dressing rooms are even worse if they are gendered. Like they weren't meant for me.
I forgot to mention this, sorry, but before I left I did some research into this. I measured key areas and compared them to graphs I found online to translate my approximate size in things before going. I wasn't about to go into a dressing room at that time either! XD
Spare me, bot. This is not the time for your dumb antics
Not squeezing air out of you should be just pulled tight so that it stays straight around you but not so much it squishes your skin as then the clothes will do the same 
Basically hold it as tight as you want the clothes to fit
Hey, make your way one shop at a time?
Property damage is highly encouraged!
I believe the line was ""Yippee ki-yay Mister Falcon!""
*Transition impossible*
See, yeah, that's the anxiety talking. The vast majority of people don't notice or even think about anything outside of themselves or the people they directly interact with. Everyone's the main character in their own head, everyone else is supporting cast or extras.
this 100%
me, overanalyzing every little visual thing that could out me: AHHHHHHH
When I was in college, I was really sick and had to miss a whole semester. When I returned, several people distinctly remembered me at places and events that took place while I wasn’t there at all!
Reminds me of a similar phenomenon when witnesses are being interviewed (both to a crime and Police/military witnesses recounting their own experiences). Very rarely can they actually recount details about the person, even if its someone they have literally stared down and demanded the surrender of.

Life isn't as poetic as movies, there's no ""I could see the fear in his bright blue eyes, the sweat upon his charcoal-black brow"". Its literally ""I saw a humanoid figure, I think his hair was black or it might've been blonde, looked somewhere between 18 and 90"".
Remember, credit cards for stores are only useful if you truly shop there a lot. If there's an annual fee I'd recommend against. If it's free actually, make sure you pay it off every single month. They profit off you holding a balance and you'll end up paying more than any reward if you do.
Me with EU46-47 shoes be like
I’m a 12. Juuuuuust barely available from most companies, but only online. Stores stop at 11 normally. I’ll find the odd 12 as a return from an online purchase and I “squee” internally. If I took HRT and shrunk to 11 I’d be ecstatic.
Omg i have sephora near my house definitely going there next time, thanks for the tip!
non sequitur but I know about wolverine frogs now and it's all your fault lol, nature is horrifying
Nice to have a staff perspective! That makes a lot of sense. Reappearing, specific requests and a personality that's knowingly attracting attention.
Hilarious, i didn't thought it would have voice acting, the whole thing seems way too dramatic and the game was very unforgiving.



Overall great I had a laugh and then i went on a search for realistic dress up games so the game was well worth. 




I don't think is great at helping trans people with all the stealth stuff and nervousness if you want to help, make the main character overthink it get a ""game over"" screen, and when he looks up there is nobody looking, you then shop and maybe get one conversation with the one overzealous employee that will be a realistic experience and way more reassuring than this 3 minute drama
Thanks a lot  so reassuring!
Agreed honestly, after going to buy i now realise i would of love to take more time looking at what I was buying definitely genius!
But they are! (i honestly didn't enter in very gendered places either, but im definitely throwing myself there once i more or less pass! )
Through the ventilation ducts!
Tell me you had basic cable as a kid without telling me you had basic cable as a kid.
Feels like that sometimes! :)
*theme music intensifies*
Yeah, it's all pretty wild.
Haha. Same! All I want to think about is will I be noticed, what if they say something, omg my voice sounds terrible, do I look ok, is that person looking at me? I can't tell my brain to stfu.
My favourite one is that, when I'm out for a walk in girl mode, if there's a woman behind me, I become hyper-paranoid that my gait isn't feminine enough ':)
I don't know of this credit cards you are talking, the fidelity programs i have been invited to ask only for your email to throw you spam wich i honestly coudn't care less about.




Definitely will never pay for a membership I don't need to think twice about that!
God, fucking same.
Tbh, once you go over a 42, you're pretty much mostly fishing from the same pond. Trainers are manageable to find in larger sizes (most are kind of unisex anyway) but if you want heels, it's pretty much Pleaser or Onlymaker that are your options.

Occasionally Asos has women's heels in sizes up to 46 but the sizing is very hit and miss. I have a pair of ankle boots which I bought in a 44 that fit perfectly but also ordered a pair of knee high boots in a 44 and they basically fit as if they were a 41 (my wife wears an EU41 so I tested with a pair of her boots to confirm my suspicion).
fucking same, i can barely find fitting men's shoes lmao

that being said hrt *can* reduce foot size so...
Likely it'll happen. I just fit in my gfs 9s when I couldn't before I'm just over a month on HRT
I'm early on E, and I went from a US Men 12 to Men 10 (US Women 14 ->12). Apparently it's pretty common to lose 1-2 shoe sizes.
Always glad to help a sister out 🥰

\^\^ This right here

Actually, when I was in school a couple of my fraternity brothers and I had a drinking game for whenever the edited for TV version of that movie came on around the holidays.... three pretty simple rules actually:

i) When John McClane opens his mouth and his voice clearly isn't Bruce Willis: \*drink\*

ii) When dialogue was clearly reused from another scene for an edit (e.g. the first clip in [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DWjFNMDOKw4) compilation) : \*drink\*  

iii) During that triumphant scene on a snowy runway when McClane is about to light a stream jet fuel on fire:  raise your glass, shout ""Yippee ki-yay Mister Falcon!"" and down the rest of your beverage in celebration.
Gotcha! Fidelity is also a bank name so it made my head go there. A free reward program for a favorite shop is very much different.
Literally my same thought. I already was on the border of having to custom order what I actually wanted, nothing has changed... \*sigh\*

What makes you think they're AFAB?

Genuinely curious about this. A couple of reverse image searches found nothing, and their post history chronicles their first year on HRT with pictures.
Eskimo is a racist term that’s derogatory to the Inuit people.
Great look
Soz, maybe should specify that I dropped a /s

She just looks incredibly stunning and makes me jelly.

Apologies for the confusion
Based on Wikipedia, Eskimo is seen as offensive in Canada, Greenland, and to some extent in Alaska, but not in Siberia.

In Canada and Greenland, the proper alternative is Inuit. For Siberia and Alaska the proper term seems to be Yupik. The US Government uses ""Alaska Native"", but that seems to have legal connotations as well. The term Eskimo is still often used in many places, however.

If you want to be super broad you could also use Aboriginal or indiginous people, but those include any other populations besides the Inuit and Yupik as well.

I think overalls are my stylistic Blindspot. Maybe I'll upload a pic when I get to work

Well it seems you are starting from a good base. Usually “thicker” means carrying most of that weight on your waist. Even a corset can’t move that.  So having any extra weight already on your hips rather than elsewhere is pretty good fortune."	ya8ol4	trans	1443	0.97	2022-10-21 23:59:05

Gorgeous! Is that the T-Mobile magenta? I think their color is just wonderful!
With all I just read about t-mobile in the comments of this post....I know where I might work

that hoodie is so pog, i didnt even realize it had a comapny logo on it at first
T mobile?


T mobile.
is this magentalove stuff? by telekom.de
Should cover the logo to avoid free advertising for a mega corporation in queer space imo
They do. I don't know the particulars, though, as I had my FFS before we were bought by them (Was Sprint).
Jokes on you, that's the new Target logo.
lol
lol
It is
I live in America, but I am of Irish and Scottish ancestry, mostly.
Well, this mega corporation is one the most diverse, accepting, supportive and inclusive, that I've ever worked for, but thank you for your opinion.
Oh thanks for the info. We’re about to be coworkers then lol jk
Could you get *more* FFS...?
Not sure what you mean by that. Want to elaborate?
Like, additional FFS surgeries to increase femininity?
I could but I don't think I need more, personally."	km01k0	trans	1437	0.97	2020-12-28 21:58:36
I’m a 23 year old lesbian trans woman. My biggest struggle has been finding clothing as I am 6ft tall, along with finding the right wig for me as my hair is growing.. any suggestions on a specific wig that has worked for you online?		"This looks like a humans of new york post
I also am interested since I'm 6ft too.
You’re beautiful!
Real hair wigs please 😆
r/tallgirls is the sub for you! There's tons of topics for tall women, including clothing threads.
Awww gosh dang you look amazing alright sis 💜💜 if thats a wig its an amazing one and I love that outfit uou are wearing 😊
OMFG, I just went full audible gasp!!! You're gorgeous! I'm pretty much in love with every wig I've bought from [https://www.evahair.com/](https://www.evahair.com/)
AHH okay so Hairspells is really good, and bellami hair also! Also you look amazinnnnn✨✨✨✨
My partner absolutely loves wigpop wigs from Amazon. She has so many i have lost count. Even the fake ones look super good and feel great to me.
I've surprisingly had great luck with Amazon human hair wig. Since you're going to be wearing yours a lot, definitely a lace front if you don't already have one (is that one you're wearing?). You may even like a 360 lace front. I wear a lace front every day, and i honestly love it. My fave one is from amazon, and it's the most natural-looking thing I've ever worn, though i took a gamble at \~150$.

Most of the wigs on Amazon sit at about 22.5 for circumference. I have a big head/thick natural hair (24in) but even the above wig from amazon I've somehow made work. 

Almost all of the human hair lace front wigs you see online are coming from China, but if you want one specifically for you, you can get one custom made (you'd buy all the bundles separately, including the lace front).
The one you have right now looks very realistic! How was the hair transplant? Do you feel comfortable sharing a before and after? Maybe in DM? 
Looking good🤗
You're so sexy
Question, why would you need a wig if your hair is growing? I don't quite get it.
May i say that you look absolutely stunning? Not to mention your height, tall girls are great!
Beautiful!
There is also a kind of wig you get applied at a salon and it gets braided or stitched to your hair so even if it grows, then it won't be an issue in the short to medium term. But if your hair is too short, they just braid it IIRC. You should look into it! I know of a Mexican youtuber who did it for testing purposes and she loved it but it was weird the first time, usually they do it when you want/need longer hair and have no time to grow it out.
is not just about the wig, but how you style it to look more real! plucking and drying is super important! i suggest you check milesjai's channel, aside from being a gracefull funny talented enby, they know alottt about wigs and have several videos styling human hair and synthetic wigs!
Ah you look terrific woman! I am 6ft too and I just purchase XL and they work well...best of luck!
For clothing, you could look into sewing your own. r/sewing is a super inclusive community with tons of help and support for all levels of sewing.

Also, you look amazing!!!!!
You are so gorgeous 😍
Im 6'3 transmale, but when i had to dress fem, i offten found drag websites have the absolute best shoes XD. Also there are "" big and tall"" for wemon online, and torrid!! There great.
You look absolutely beautiful. Your face is stunning. 
I have bought some tall clothes from Eddie Bauer and old navy online that are casual. 
I buy my wigs from a store in person so you can see them and feel them before you buy.
You are so beautiful!
6ft y’all lesbians are the hottest

Edit: autocorrect won’t let me say tall because I’m a southerner
GIRL. Where do you get your clothes?? im also 6ft!
I'm 5' 10"" and my best friend who's 6' 4"" that's also trans shop at a store called Maurices. You can order stuff online or go in store. They are the only place I know that has tall and long sizes in stock at their stores. I get almost all my work and casual clothes from there.
You look beautiful ❤️ can't suggest on the wig, I have yet to order mine XD
Im 6'4 and trans worst part wearing a 15w shoe in mens and a 15 ring size...
You’re so frikken cute! 

But to answer ur questions I find that human hair wigs are good bet. I usually try to find them on ✨sale✨ because I love a good deal. When it comes to outfits I would say dresses that flare are always flattering. Don’t be afraid to mix and match from the men section though! That’s what I do if the ladies don’t have what I want lol. Foot size if where it gets a bit tricky. If you find your size, always have sneakers for backup when your heels piss you off.
Wow you look great as a blonde
You are beautiful hope ya had a great Thanksgiving!
What’s that mean?
Yeah. Need to find a specific clothing store for tall girls
same, also finding shoes is really hard :(
American eagle for jeans, hollister for shorts, and long tall sally for shoes. Peltz has good stuff too.
Thank you all of you! 6 ft gender fluid person struggling to find more fem wear who has a short list. I've also had luck with shoes at Nordstrom Rack!
Btw petlz shoe store, and long tall sally for shoes. Bombas.com for extra large socks
I'd check out Gardeaux wigs
Thank you 🥰
Also, idk if this might help with the clothing department, but: [http://www.mookychick.co.uk/indie-fashion/plus-size/goth-clothing-tall-women.php](http://www.mookychick.co.uk/indie-fashion/plus-size/goth-clothing-tall-women.php)
Awesome!!!
Hey do you know what wig specifically you bought on amazon do you have a link? There’s a ton on amazon that are also pretty bad that I’ve ordered.
My hair is only 1.5 inches long right now. And I got a hair transplant surgery. It’s got a lot of growing to do.
Yeah but I don’t want baggy lol I want to look slim
You look super pretty and the picture looks well-taken, basically. That series is casual pictures of people about their daily lives, and this looks casual and cute.
It’s a huge compliment...and also OMGODDESS you are gorgeous!
It's a a facebook page, you should check it out
I’m 6’1 and I love ASOS & old navy tall. Both are affordable and pretty good quality.
I have a friend who’s 6ft and swears by UniQlo
Right!
Long tall sally, i think theyre having a sale rn, tho its a tad expensive
Thanks for the info

Try watching TallGirlTakover on YouTube. The girl presenting is 6’3”
So I ordered this one, but it's not available any more.

It's time for me to get another wig (both of mine have lasted for a year now, but for whatever reason I wanna start searching for their replacements) - this is the one that's in my save for later list, but i want to find one that has a bigger cap size

Ohhhh, so you mean for while your hair grows in? Thanks for clarifying :)
Ok my profile photos don’t show baggy...I am 6ft 190 so not sure how large you are...
Like the photo and the description
Agreed. Old Navy has good prices, a nice range of tall sizes, even including tops and bodysuits (a rarity), which are always a problem for me at 6’2”.
This is helpful news as I too am.of the 6ft and above variety.
Really appreciate it!!! Will be looking into them for sure
Hmm never heard of it. Will have to research
holy, they're pretty darn expensive, but I guess you get what you pay for and not like some cheap fast fashion from china or sth like that.
Oh right that's today. Thank you 😊
Correct. It’ll take a long time for my hair to grow. Just 4 months ago I was bald because I didn’t like my male pattern baldness so I shaved it off as a man. But since I’m transitioning I got the hair surgery and now it’s growing out again!
Interesting. I’m 6ft 180 actually
I typically order L which fits well just that it’s too short almost like every shirt is a crop too on me lol
Looked at it and still don’t understand what you mean 🤣 is it a bad thing?
I’ve gotten multiple body suits at asos and it felt amazing to actually be able to wear one!! ♡ I don’t know of any other stores besides those two that have tops, dresses, body suits, swim etc in tall
Try Shein and ASOS too.
They are expensive but the clothes are actually modeled on tall people. It makes it so much better when shirts actually fit you, and dont fit like children's clothes lol
no problem sis :)
So close in size I think I look decent in my dresses
Yup same here..I am dieting to get down to 170-175...you look awesome!
No not at all, it means you're photogenic ❤
Not bad in the slightest.
I’ve gotta check ASOS. Thanks!"	jn4x29	trans	1405	1.0	2020-11-03 05:47:16

You’ve got such a full life ahead of you, don’t let anyone keep you down! For you and anyone else that needs to hear it today; I love you and I’m proud of you.

Stop looking down on yourself you are beautiful and pretty and cute and I wish I looked as cute as you you are amazing
You look amazing I can't wait to get my own clothes
I think you look gorgeous
They look like mine! Looking good! 💜
Congratulations you look wonderful ♥️♥️
So cute! I love that skirt! And the simple black skirt with the black tights is a great classic combo ewe 

Oh! If you want to know a trick to help your waistline have more of a hourglass shape, I suggest getting a belt and wearing clothing pieces that flair out at the waist. This will help to create the illusion of having a more traditionally feminine waistline. Petticoats also help, as the create more bulk at your hips, making your waist appear smaller and more hourglass shaped. 

Hopefully this help! Congrats, hon!
Love it!! Keep being you girl! Those boots look BOMB
Those boots look really good on you!
You’re very pretty

> i hate everything above my waist
i f e e l you omg
Lüks hella güd ☺️

I love the gloves(?) sm!
Looks sexy as hell.
Honestly, I'm probably not even half way there, but this one step felt pretty great.
I wasn't planning on it. All compliments are appreciated!
Thank you!
Oh, I got them off of [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K414THP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_K1VPSX8CFPHQHFWNHKW6?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). Nothing to fancy but they're really nice and fit me well despite the humongous size of my feet. I'm a men's 13 and had to get their largest size, a 15, for it to fit.
😅 Do I? It feels like I bought too much black clothes. Also, though you can't see it, I'm really starting to lean into the goth style with the chokers/collars I've been getting.
I just want you to know that I see you everywhere within lgbt spaces on Reddit and I appreciate you and what you do every couple days.

Thanks for doing what you do dad.
Yeah. It's pretty great.
Thank you!
Yes, they are! I used to just steal from my mother's closet, but now I have my own clothes that I bought with my own money, and they fit me so much better!
Thanks! It means a lot.
Thank you so much! I am a little lucky when it comes to this. Although my body isn't all that feminine, and I don't have many friends or family members that are likely to accept me, I got an early start. If I could start HRT when I'm 18 I'd be the happiest girl in the world!
I hope to be able to show the rest (up to my neck anyways) soon too. I'm not quite comfortable with how my torso looks atm, but I'm going to try and slim down a little and get some new tops.
😊
Thank you! I got them off [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08K414THP/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_YFX9ZF99JR40XECDFYMZ?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1). I wasn't sure if they would fit because of my large feet, but I was pleasantly surprised when they fit perfectly!
Thanks! I'll do my best!
Very.

It'll happen eventually! The wait is worth it trust me. How old are you now?

I have heard a little about that! I'll definitely be giving it a try in the future.

They're arm warmers, and they're fucking awesome. I got them [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B018IS625C/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_fabc_NJ0KFYCKSJ7S4MVBJ2FH?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1) on Amazon. Be warned, the thumb holes might not fit well depending on hand size. The one on my right hand tore along the seam because my thumb was too big. It should be an relatively easy repair, but I thought I'd tell you.

U got plenty of time to try different styles, just do what u like :)
Awe thanks
no problem :)
I’m so happy for you, girl! And hey look, you’ll like your top half in time too - nothing wrong with focusing on the parts that give you most euphoria right now tho!
Saw a great post on DND today talking about how your family is just a suggested party, and you’re free to build any party that suits you - even a gaggle of pyromancer lizardfolk. That resonated with me so hard as someone that had a falling out.
Well I’m proud of you for being able to show any part of yourself. Trust me I know it’s not an easy process, but you’re doing great
I believe in you! 🏳️‍⚧️
Oooo I bet there amazing
16 I'm just trying to get a job first to pay for them.

My profile description will tell you the basics about me.
Even better! I freakin love thumb holes, and you get arm warmers too... actually look like they might be helpful in digital drawing?! Thank you!
my first pair of women’s shoes weren’t too far off from those, if you ever want suggestions lemme know
Some are enough.
Or, to call it the other way, you should not hate your whole Body. That makes bad thoughts. And bad thoughts make suicidal thoughts
Thanks’ so much! I have gigantic hands lol ;-;
😁
Thank you.
Glad I could be of help!
That's true I suppose.
Yeah I need to focus on the euphoric parts for my own sanity, but don't worry, the other parts aren't going to be neglected! I will remain positive for the future!
I do love the idea of that. If I could just move to a nearby city and rebuild my life and family that would be awesome.
Thanks a lot!
Money problems? Understandable. I need to get a job too.
I'm relatively broke as I don't have a job, so I'll probably only buy this one pair for now.
Size 14's too? That's awesome!
Of course
I know my collage(uk) has a place that help you find part time jobs and stuff so maybe yours does to.
valid
Well, they're in woman's sizes, so you might have to go up a little. Idk.
Maybe
Yeah. This pair was 70, which I feel is actually a pretty good price for a pair this hot, but I won't be doing it again any time soon.
I have no idea where your from so I don't know how it works for you to get a job at 17.

Also if you ever feel lonely or the dysphoria gets and I'm here if you want some one to talk to in those times or if you wanna play a game hit me up if you want. I'm saying this as you have been so nice and it has actually made me feel like my self more then I did 10 mims ago so thank you for that
Thanks. Maybe I'll take you up on that offer another time. I'm always happy to talk. Btw I live on the east coast of America.

"With the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill possibly passing, how do you think your life would have been different if there was education around LGBTQ+?"	"TW/RANT/DISCUSSION

&#x200B;

Ill start this off by saying I am all for education teaching students about LGBTQ people.

I didn't start transitioning until 2019/age 22. The biggest reason why? I had no idea that I could. I have had these feelings for as long as I remember. As early as 4th/5th grade. I used to look up spells & magic to find out ways to turn myself into a girl. I once wrote a note on a rock and buries it because that was one of the spells. (Newsflash, it didn't work). I even had found a website where you ""sell"" your soul to the devil in order for a wish. That didn't work either. 

For years throughout middle & high school, I crossdressed. I would wear man clothes on top to hide it. I even wore some makeup, and passed it off as being emo. But that was it. That was all I could do. There was no information or anything, that was all I was going to be. 

Fast forward to when I move out of my parents. I no longer had to hide crossdressing from them, and did it on the daily in my own place. This was right out of HS. I was in such a great place that I decided to call PP. Unfortunately they said they didn't offer trans care. At the time, I didn't realize I was trans, but that's what they told me. 

Maybe you're wondering. How could I crossdress, how could I want to be a girl so badly, but not realize I was trans? Because I had never heard of it! They never taught it. Being gay was popular at the time, so everyone knew about that, but nothing of transgenderism. 

I then googled trans people and fell into a dark rabbit hole. I saw the worse of transgenderism. I saw people who didn't pass. I saw what just looked like fully grown old men with beards, muscles, etc, in a dress. Basically, I saw what every Terf wants people to see. 

I didn't want to be that. I would rather be stuck as a man forever than to dress up as a woman and look like that. So for several more years, I kept it in. I repressed it. I hated myself and everything about the 'trans' version of me. I ended up moving back in with my parents for a bit, again, no longer crossdressing and keeping everything in. This led to very bad depression, though I didn't realize that it was because I was repressing everything, 

When I moved out of their house, 22 at the time, it all came flooding back. I had all of these urges to dress like a girl, and decorate my room like a girl, and be feminine in every way possible. Thats when I went down the rabbit hole again. This time, I found out about HRT. I found out about surgeries. I found out that I could LITERALLY turn myself into a woman. I was so surprised. I didn't know that any of it was possible. The extent of my knowledge was that I could dress up as a girl, while being a man. I had no idea I could actually BE a girl. 

Fast forward to now. I've been on HRT for 2 years. I'm 2 months post op from SRS. I have fucking boobs. BOOBS. I used to tape my chest so id have cleavage. I HAVE BOOBS. Sorry lol. 

Long story, I know, but I wanted you to understand why I feel education is important. Had there been education revolving LGBTQ, my entire life could have been different. I could have started transitioning so much sooner. Yeah, 22 isn't a bad age, but fuck 15 would have been a lot better. 

People are so against the education of it, thinking it'll create trans people, or gay people, or etc, but in reality, all it is doing is pushing these people deeper into 'the closet' only for them to have more and more issues as their life progresses. 

I almost killed myself so many times. I was a cutter, my arm is lined with them. I had terrible depression. So much more. All could have been avoided had there been someone to educate me, and tell me I'm okay. That I'm normal. 

Sorry for the long rant, but yeah. What do ya'll think?"	"When people ban discussion, it only highlights their own fear of the inadequacy of their own words.

Additionally, the bill will allow the schools to out children which will definitely result in abuse if not murder.

They’re afraid of boys being girls but are fine with dead kids.
I would’ve been able to be myself as a kid. I started transitioning when I was 21. It would have been so nice to know that I wasn’t alone as a kid and that I had a valid reason for feeling what I felt. I could’ve started transitioning sooner and been so much happier.
I'm about the same age as you, as when I was growing up, I was not aware that anything LGBTQ+ even remotely existed, except to know that Gay was considered a curse word. As I got older, I became aware of gays and lesbians, and 'transvestites'. The message was that gays & lesbians were crimes against nature, and against god, and trans folks were too, but even more so. When I was an older teen, the message changed again - gays, lesbians, and bi people were okay, at a distance, so long as they kept it to themselves and didn't try to 'indoctrinate' kids with it. Trans was still wrong, and I recall the argument/story that 'transvestites' were mentally ill, and that the hospitals/ facilities that performed gender affirming surgeries refused (or in some iterations it was outlawed) as it apparently made no difference and didn't 'cure' trans people.

Obviously, this is all a very negative, toxic outlook. Had there been education, I probably would have realised I was trans a lot sooner, and I would certainly hate myself less for it. But, in the eyes of my parents, and the community I grew up in, I would have been 'indoctrinated'.
I would’ve known that I was trans and interested in women as a lesbian, sooner…
i want people to make lgbtq+ school so we are able to be ourselfs and don’t have to worry about bigots
I spent my entire childhood thinking I was asexual- actually trying to enforce my own asexuality- because it was easier than coping with my own body in context with other people.

 I didn't see a trans man that wasn't getting pregnant(which was like body horror to me at the time) in the news until my 20s- and now I still have trouble knowing what I want. Probably won't ever, because my brain finished growing while I was still confused.
Oh, completely.

If I'd had any competent education about gender and sexuality as relates to personal identity, I'd probably have figured out I'm a girl decades earlier.

And since the hypothetical existence of such an education implies that there would have been resources available to *help* me, yeah, I'd probably be living a completely different life and overall probably would have been a lot happier.

I 100% agree that a proper gender identity and sexuality curriculum would not only help, but would save, a lot of lives. On so many levels.
the entirety of my 4th through 6th grade was at a private Christian school and 7th and 8th grade i was homeschooled. during that time i hardly knew what trans meant, and of course the world around me frame all trans people as predatory men wanting to be women and girls trying to be trendy and cute by identifying as trans. but in 8th grade even tho i was still homeschooled, i got a phone and started actually learning about the world and deconstructing the illusions built by the church and my parents and the internalized phobia i had from being taught that. the more i learned about LGBTQ the more i identified with it, the more i identified as trans. i started identifying as non-binary, and went i went to a real public highschool the next year i found a few people who accepted me and later that year i came out as a trans male.

if there was any actual education about LGBTQ+ people, not only would i have realized i was trans and come out wayyyy earlier, but the world around me probably would have been way safer and way more accepting. the don't say gay bill doesn't ""protect"" kids from learning about LGBTQ, it just prolongs the discovery of their identity and/or make it *less* safe for LGBTQ kids.
When I was growing up Michelle Bachmann introduced a similar law that made it illegal for school employees to talk about anything queer, even if that meant they couldn't talk about their own family with their students, in the school district right next to mine and I grew up hearing about 11 suicides of kids like me one after another.

Even though my school implemented two LGBTQ clubs in response because they didn't want the suicide contagion spreading to our school I still knew I wasn't safe. And I knew about trans people and even had 3 trans classmates who were out and a 4th who was still closeted but taking HRT in preparation of coming out after graduation. And there was still bullying in my school and our counselors and principle were still so useless i just said fuck it and graduated early to escape, but my closeted trans friend ended up getting held back so she was alone and stuck at home even longer because of the mental toll it took on her school performance. 

Everyone could tell I was some kinda queer, especially the kid who made a beeline to my locker to call me a fag every day for 2 years, and even though I now realize I'm a gay trans man I buried that down deep and just said I was pansexual so the only queer cred I got was being the ""practice girl"" for any cis girl who wanted to sexually experiment and that fucks with me because they got to be authentically queer but I didn't, not really.
I didn't expect this to get so much traction! I'm both glad that I'm not alone in this, but also very sad that I'm not alone in this. It's such a tragedy that so many of us have had similiar situations regarding this one topic. I wish that was enough to prove to everyone else that education is needed. 

I'll respond to comments as I can. But I see you. Thank you <3
I probably (and a lot of other older trans ppl I know) wouldn't have suppressed it for so long and could've started earlier, also I might've not been gone so deep into depression. But I did get a better sense for ppl so I know who to keep at distance :)
I think a lot of things would have made more sense. I've never felt that I fit. If I'd know about trans people were a thing then that would at least have gone some way to explain a few things. There was no representation of trans people for me growing up let alone non binary people. The only time you even heard anything were slurs.  Something to be looked down on. :(
The scary thing as well is that on top of people not being educated, it will probably make it seem more socially acceptable to simply laugh and joke about LGBTQ+ people. Like it was when I was in school.

... Like a million years ago :p
God this is so important. I'm so stressed out by this bill
Nothing would have changed for me. I knew it was all real stuff (limited understanding granted). 

I just thought I was different. Coming out to myself with or without education was a struggle. But ofc this shit needs to be discussed in schools cause fuck the education system in general.
I just started transition a couple months ago in my mid 40's. The desire has been there since I was a teenager, but I didn't even know what transgender WAS until I was much older. I didn't really know what was possible with HRT until maybe a year ago. I just had no idea. Like, I thought all trans women had implants. Had no clue. 

I spent a LONG time being unhappy before I figured this shit out on my own. One of my biggest regrets in my life is all that unhappy time. My best years, wasted on depression. Seeing all the pics from 18 year olds asking if it's too late for them... All of this could have been avoided if I had even the tiniest bit of information as a kid. Of course, that's why conservatives oppose it. They'd rather see trans kids kill themselves than BE themselves.
I will never forgive my (devout LDS) parents for depriving me of knowledge that could have made my transition happen earlier. When I had my first gay (at the time I still though I was a man) experience, and expressed I might be bisexual, my mom laughed in my face and told me that wasn't a real thing. Not conflating gender and sexuality, but I knew I didn't live in a safe place to assert that I was different.

I leaned so heavily into the emo/scene kid phase, and it took years for me to realize ""oh fuck, I just liked wearing girl-cut clothes, makeup, long hair, etc.""

So many fuckin signs were there, but ""gender is an eternal characteristic of identity and purpose"" was literally framed on the wall of my house (a normal thing for Mormons, no seriously.) I am still in the process of forgiving myself for waiting so long, and I will not ever forgive them.

Education in a public setting would have potentially saved me years of suicidal identity crisis and a former pill addiction.
If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, I would've avoided a lot of hurt and trauma. Kids would be more supportive and tolerant of me and my friends. Instead, I was bullied. Majorly. One kid saw me holding hands and cuddling with my girlfriend at the time during lunch and he outed me and them to the entire grade/school. People would tell us all the time that we were weird or disgusting for being a same-sex couple. 

On top of that, I was also trans (non-binary). It was a constant battle of hearing people misgender and deadname me. If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, they would've known that gender is a social construct, and therefore there are an infinite amount of gender identities out there. It's why transgender people have an alarmingly high suicide rate because people aren't educated and they bully them.

I'm not sure if I live in the area where the bill is in the process of being passed (I hope it doesn't get passed) it's stressing me the fuck out. All of my trans friends or just any lgbtqia+ friends please stay safe out there, and I'm proud of all of you <3
I had education about it and I’d wish that on everyone. It wasn’t perfect. To me it always felt more like gay/trans people exist and you should respect them then maybe you are gay/trans too. I though asexuality was a hypothetical orientation and definately only associated bisexuality with celebrities. Also I remember being 11 and discussing with my classmates if someone could be both trans and gay or if that would cancel each other out. But I got the general gist of it that queer people exist and just let them be, which is a great start (also the idea that teachers hide the gayness of ancient greece feels so weird to me. My teacher was very vocal about his problems with the fact that the movie Troy made Patroklos Achilles’ cousin)
You literally explained my entire situation perfectly everything besides the moving out part was literally me word for word. I had wanted to be a girl since elementary school and used to secretly cross dress when people weren't around and whenever I'd say or mention anything slightly feminine people would react strangely so I shoved it down and hated it for years but no matter what I did it wouldn't go away. Then I sort of learned what trans was but yeah I saw the guys dressed like girls and I was like ew no, or I saw girls with guy parts, and that's all I thought it was forever. I'm 19 so I haven't moved out yet, but recently I decided to finally figure out that part of me instead of shove it down and try to get rid of it. Did some research and was had the same reaction as you pretty much, I was like damnnnn I can fr be a girl wtf, no way and now I'm starting hrt in 2 weeks and I couldn't be more excited or happy about it
I wish they would have talked about it when I was in school. Then maybe I would have realized all the feelings and thoughts I had were normal. I’m 35 now and just realizing I’m trans. 🥺🥺
God fucking dammit i needed to hear this so bad 
Ive canceled so many first appointments because “i can never be a woman”. At least not like those other tf girls who always look absolutely stunning . Today i shaved my face (and most of my body- its a forest now x.x) for the first time in months. I i put on a feminine outfit that had been sitting in its amazon packaging for like two months, unsure if itd even fit me. 


Looking in the mirror i started crying because i saw exactly who i needed to be to finally achieve true peace. Since that moment id bounce the hrt thing back and forth, terrified of getting stuck in some inescapable trans purgatory id fabricated from ideas of people who would never know what its like to be me. So much fear… and for what? 


Then i read your post…. Im shaking and crying as i write this but because of you and this post , along with every other absolutely beautiful person in this sub who has been brave enough to share their journey, im doing it.


IM SCHEDULING MY FIRST VISIT FOR HRT RIGHT NOW!!! 


Thank you, OP, for fighting these so called false norms and loudly realizing what i feel so many of us need to. Some of us (like myself) just cant help but be stubborn with ourselves. Posts like yours have so much power to change that ❤️ 


Also thank you to my wonderfully supportive girlfriend who i cant wait to join me on this journey herself :,)
I hope she sees this too :) im gonna go give her a big hug as soon as i catch my breath.


And thank you so much to everyone else sharing their stories as well as their progress. If they ban discussion we’ll fucking start our own. You can’t silence those on the path to self enlightenment and happiness. Especially when you shout from the towers of fear, loathing and misery! The governments with anti-trans agendas will make it harder , they always do, but when have they ever effectively stopped shit. I mean the war on drugs seems to have certainly worked okay 🙄 


(Im sorry for the potentially nonsensical rant. Im so used to apathy and lack of emotion, that im having trouble even thinking clearly now ffs)


Tldr: OP, im starting my HRT journey id put off for so many years thanks to your post. I know it wasnt the main topic but god damn you struck a nerve in me T.T
Thank you again ❤️


I love you all so gosh darn much. ❤️

Im tired of being a woman pretending to be a man because society decided thats where i fit. And im tired of seeing my “condition” as anything but a facade being forced upon me by soulless masked faces. No more, this girl is ready to be happy :,)

Im ready for this mask to be gone once and for all , and fuckin hell ill be loud about it - bills or no bills.
This, only 40.

Growing up in the 80's, I never knew just what could be done until I stumbled onto it here a few years ago.
This was a great sharing story. Thank you!  I had similar experiences as you, but I didn’t find out about these things until my late 20s, and even then, I repressed my feelings and felt trapped in my life path. YouTube trans vloggers really helped me. The internet was nascent when I was 15 and my parents technophobic tendencies kept me from a lot of resources as well. Education would be amazing. But unfortunately there’s a lot of education to do for the people making education decisions, and they’re way less open to ideas and change.
Are-..are you me?

I had such a similar experience of just “I didn’t know this was an option!”. Growing up in the south as well we didn’t really have this kind of visibility in the first place. And the first time I learned about it I didn’t have enough information to really process and accept it and had that same experience of googling and subsequently thinking “I wouldn’t be able to pass so I think I’d be even more miserable”. Like. I didn’t see hope at the end of that tunnel. Then after repressing it’s for a few more years and being depressed, learning more about it, and actually having available information this has been the greatest choice of my life.

Also turns out my family was suspecting it since I was 3. Still lil salty they didn’t let me in on the secret sooner lol
Thanks for sharing! I relate so hard. I'm 27 and just starting and was oblivious to the trans option until a few years ago. I grew up in Poland, completely sheltered from gay people or people of colour etc. - any mention of trans people was maybe an occasional joke on the tv.

Only after moving to UK in my teens and spending a lot of time online have I slowly cured that toxic conditioning.

I wish trans education was more common both now and then. I'd know sooner, and maybe wouldn't be so worried about my family to come out. 

❤️
Knowing what ace is would most certainly have helped a lot. 

Knowing I am a Transfem Enby would have spared me easily 10 years of depression, possibly more.
[Section 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28). I lived with it. 

To avoid any accusations of ""promoting homosexuality"", there was no mention of sexuality or gender at all.

It didn't stop people realising they were other than cis-het later in life but did lead to some confused, closeted, often self loathing people. These days, at least there's the internet.
Free speech, until it comes to what they don't want to hear. I fucking hate these bills.
Well, I didn't know being anything other than straight was a thing until I was 13. After I'd had my first kiss with a ""same sex"" person. And I only knew that being trans was a thing until I was 21 (I'm 29 now, haven't started transitioning yet and don't know when that'll be because I come from a toxic, conservative family that has fucked me up in more ways than one). And then when I was 23 I was like ""okay, think I'm not cis, I may be enby and uh okay so maybe I'm not straight..."" because it was just easier (and I was afraid, please don't come for me saying this is bad rep for the community, everyone's lives are different). And I only came to the fantastic conclusion that I wasn't enby when I was 25, and it's been a nightmare since then. Because again, toxic family, if I come out in any way, I'll be ostracised and I have CPTSD (from the toxic family) and am not neurotypical so that wouldn't be good. I'm just trying to survive, I guess. But in what ways? Well, I think I'd have been miserable much earlier. I'm sorry this isn't an inpirational tale of earlier self-discovery. I showed signs of being masc since early childhood but I simply didn't know.
Without this Reddit page and educational websites my many misconceptions about being trans would’ve taken many more years to be corrected, would’ve been miserable. And as for my sexuality, I’m currently grappling with my being aroace and I can guarantee it would be a lot easier with more education and representation. I’m kind of relying on Jughead and Todd Chavez here
Maybe. I’m just now getting some understanding in my late 20s. 

I certainly didn’t have a full understanding in my teens. But I had the internet. I did quite a bit of reading on wikipedia and google. The information online even in the late ‘00s was nowhere near as good as it is now. I knew that surgeries were a thing. I knew that LGBT people existed. I knew a few people in the gay-straight alliance in high school, and I knew about gay people from TV. Hell, I even knew that I probably wasn’t 100% straight. But for me, changing gender was something that mostly existed in the sci-fi novels I read. I didn’t ever think transition was something available to me. I didn’t know that trans communities existed, I didn’t know any out trans people IRL.

In college, I did meet and befriend some gay people and trans people. I encountered egg memes, and I was a little afraid about how much I related to them. I listened to podcasts with stories of trans experiences (shout-out to This American Life, Snap Judgment, and Risk!). I thought I might be agender, *maybe* genderfluid, but I still never considered transition as a possibility. A lot of the trans stories I heard were deeply tied with suffering, trauma, depression, etc. But my experience was more numbness, and bottling-up my feelings. 

It wasn’t until a couple years later that I started to encounter more stories similar to my feelings. And maybe more importantly, stories of trans joy. Combined with that, I finally was out of school, I had a somewhat stable career, a place to live, and I felt like I had space to work on myself. To try and become more honest, vulnerable, and in-touch with my own feelings. It was a combination of listening, reading, maturity, and life circumstances that eventually led to the egg cracking.

So for me, it’s hard to say how much my life would have been changed if I had more education about LGBTQ+ stuff in school. I wish I might have been more comfortable experimenting with gender presentation, but I was already so obsessed with blending-in and looking “normal” that I probably wouldn’t have changed. But even if education didn’t speed up my self-discovery I think I would have been more understanding of the LGBTQ+ people around me.

And anyways, I don’t feel any huge amount of regret for starting “late” (as if your 20s is a late time to start *anything* in life). I mean, more than the physical aspects I just wish I had figured out a lot of the emotional stuff way earlier. But I guess I was protecting myself emotionally from an environment that didn’t seem entirely safe. 

TLDR: I really don’t know if better education would have helped me transition sooner. But either way, it probably would have helped me be a better person.
Pretty clearly unconstitutional and federally illegal.

Not only does it violate the 1st amendment; it also violates the civil rights act; of which LGBTQ people are covered under as per a SCOTUS decision.

Really... the concerning part is the intention might be to get this into the SCOTUS, to reverse that decision.
I didn't even know HRT was a thing until I was *25*

Needless to say, my life would have been very different if LGBT education had been a thing
God this is exactly like me. Not knowing what being trans is, finding out and seeing only non passing trans women, freaking out, repressing, finding out about HRT and finally transitioning. If only I knew sooner.
In the UK we had Section 28 which banned anything that could be construed as ""promotion of homosexuality"". It was repealed half way through my schooling but the damage was done. Didn't primary school thinking I was pathetic for not liking the same things the other boys did, then in secondary school hid my gender identity so much I ended up burning out and becoming a shell of a person. I don't know if what I like doing now is purely for the love of it or if it's cover. LGBT kids in my school were relentlessly bullied and little if anything was done about it. Things have changed, there are more of my schoolmates who are living their true lives now, but I do think we would be much more tolerant without it.
I knew I was trans at 15 or 16.. the signs started when I was in like 6th grade.

I was told that I wasn't because I wasn't straight afterwards. Knowing I'd never get the hormones needed to pass I tried my best to play the part and be a guy. I never fit in. I never felt ok. I missed all the time people spending learning who they are, and constructes a facade.Now a little over a decade later I'm transitioning.

I wouldn't have a kid. But I would have my hair. My voice. My face. I wouldn't have spent so much of my life feeling lost worthless and hating myself and my body.. I probably wouldn't have picked up self harm. I'm facing years of expensive and painful surgeries just to have a _chance_ at who I wanted to be. Who I **should** have been.
Well I knew I was trans in 1973, but I was at Tanner 2 in 1971, so yeah if education and blockers had been available *especially for the adults* I would have lived a very different life.
Seconding what you are saying. I could have known myself so much better had I just been allowed to know the truth. I grew up in a very liberal area that was relatively LGBTQ + friendly. But I never really understood that I didn’t have to be a boy if I didn’t want to because no one told me I could. Education is so important and so many aspects of life, Socio political issues, racism, the queer community. The more we learn the more we can understand, and the more we understand the more loving and tolerant we can be
Your little life story in the description is (unfortunately) very relatable. I was referring to myself as ""a boy in a girl's body"" as early as elementary school. I knew nothing about trans people other than transphobic depictions on tv, so I thought there was no way I could be that. I wasn't like those depictions. I was a real person. I was given no indication that transness was a real-people thing, and I even less knew what the hell it actually *is*. I basically thought it was crossdressing because that's essentially what those depictions showed it as. Men who refused to get out of their dresses. Something to laugh at.

On a similar-but-different hand, gay people (as tv told me) were only men, men who loved other men in a shallow way, with voices that made every word sound like it was written in pink glitter pen. Any same-gender attraction of any other sort was not anything I ever saw. And asexuality? Forget about it.

I found out I was bi when I was about 13. I found the word during a random internet scroll and didn't know what it meant. I read the definition and immediately knew it was me.

Finding out my transness was a bit trickier. Once I found out it was, in fact, a real thing, I was... 15, I believe? I clicked with it but all the transphobia I internalized over the years made me hesitant to declare myself a man. I wouldn't be decently comfortable doing so for another two years. And I'm still doubting myself after all this time.

My point is... if I were taught these words, and their real, unfiltered, non-stereotyped definitions... I probably would've had my whole identity figured out by age 8. No struggle. Minimal uncertainty. Schools can and should give this education. No one should have to deal with this confusion.
We live in a messed up world.
When I was a child, I had no knowledge of what transgender was (born in the early 80's). So to answer the question, I likely wouldn't have felt shame over cross dressing and I wouldn't have kept it a secret (immediate family is accepting). I could have gotten therapy to help me understand what I was feeling (didn't know what transgender was until I was 15 or 16). I wouldn't have felt the need to keep everything bottled up inside until I was in my late 30's and I would have been able to lead a happier and far more productive life.
If, when I was a child, I had people in my life who told me that trans people exist and that it’s okay to be trans, I feel like I would have come out much sooner. This bill is bad for so many reasons, and forcing that message out of schools is going to result in long term heartache for LGBTQ+ youth
Maybe I wouldn't be the disaster of a human being am I today.
I’m 28 and just started HRT, about a month and a week into it now. Your words, especially about just not knowing trans was a “thing” down to the terf propaganda and suicidal ideation was my experience exactly. 

What saved me was an amazing and loving partner who helped me find the information and resources, and now three months after coming out I am happier than I have ever been in my entire life, and I haven’t had a suicidal ideation SINCE I came out. 

I absolutely agree that there needs to be public education on this. My conservative grandparents threatened me countless times for acting gay or feminine and it took me until 28 to have a safe place and be myself.

Nobody should have to wait to be themselves. Cis people don’t.
I would’ve learned how to genuinely love myself rather than just acting like I did. I would’ve learned that it’s not normal to hate everything about your body the way I did. I wouldn’t have grown up hating myself and feeling dissociated from myself. I would’ve been able to be me, unapologetically, and sometimes I grieve the life I could’ve lived had I known about being trans sooner.
Gods I wish there was discussion about being transgender and being transgender wasn't stigmatized. I probably would have immediately identified with it if I was shown materials as a child.

If you asked me if I wanted to wear a dress and be a beautiful girl when I was 3 I would have said yes 1000 times. I wouldn't have spent 30 years of my life depressed that I couldn't dress the way I saw other girls dressing. I wouldn't have not had any friends because I could never relate to anyone.

My life would have been so much better. I don't understand why society wants to impose misery onto LGBTQ+ people. It's just so lame.
I grew up in the 90s with very little exposure to LGBTQ information, nor a support environment, and that definitely had an impact on me not hatching as a trans person until I was 44.

Education, visibility, and acceptance are vital.
If there was I could have definitely avoided the past 2 years of trying to piece my brain back together, I still kind of am but not so much that its driving me mad anymore
I grew up in a pretty conservative area.  I barely knew that being trans was a healthy thing you could be vs some sort of mental illness to be ashamed of until I was in college and I didn't speak to a trans person (that I was aware of) until  I was an adult.  If I knew that it was something you could explore I probably would've transitioned sooner than my earlier 30s.
You would think this bill came directly out of the Kremlin
Someone in my class said today ""that's it ladies, gentlemen, transgender men, transgenders and the the other parts of the lgbtiqa+ community"". 

Pretty sure it was supposed to be a joke but I didn't know you're no longer a man if you're gay, I thought that was a thing
I grew up in a small town where LGBTQ topics weren’t really talked about, outside of church that is, even in the early 2000s things weren’t good. It wasn’t until I started working in healthcare that I got proper sex education and a view of the world outside my bubble. I learned there are people who exist just fine outside my own ideas of what “normal” was. My favorite patients were the ones who made me go “huh, I didn’t know that was a thing that could happen” and challenged my narrow view of the world. I remember walking home from school one day and seeing a pride flag, I sorta knew what it was but just thought “I’m not sure how I should feel about that”, because that’s what I was taught.

This bill doesn’t JUST negate LGBTQ education, it enables homophobic/transphobic dogma, and not everyone is able to leave that bubble until after it’s cemented.
All I can say is thank God for the internet. Banning discussion of LGBTQ issues will do nothing and will only create negative feelings and bad blood. 

Also, people who ban things are never the good guys in history.
Oh if I had learnt anything about trans people as a kid I probably would have transitioned before puberty. My childhood was basically full time disassociation from dysphoria (which I didn't even realise I had), which lead to bullying, which lead to more disassociation. I remember thinking several times in 4th/5th grade ""I wish I was a girl."" One of my few strong memories dispite all the brain fog.

In any case, I'm 22 now too! Still pre everything but would love to start HRT this year. Congrats on your progress, I'll have to catch up!
I wouldn’t have wasted half of my life, failed relationships, and lived in absolute depression and misery until finding myself.  I would have been a smarter, more productive worker, and my work ethic is considerable to begin with.  My faith in God probably would have been preserved.
I don't have much to add here - I just want to say thank you for writing this out. I'm 28 and my experience wasn't all that different from yours, although I only just started HRT this year.

A lot of what you wrote about just hits home. I just wanted to stop by and say thanks and that I hope everything is going great for you! Cheers girl 💜
I don't know if my life would've been great or anything, but certainly a lot better.

I often wonder how my transition would've turned out if I could've transitioned at 16 instead of 30. Would I pass? Would I have more feminine features? Would I have lived a more fulfilling life? Would I be happy?

There are so many what-ifs that I'll never have answers for. And it makes me sad... Sometimes I don't know what to do, except move forward with my life today.

It fricking sucks knowing I can't have that time back. I feel robbed of my life. And it sucks. I hate it.

But I'm glad that things are changing, that people will have the choice I didn't get. That gives me hope. At least future generations will have the ability to decide for themselves if they're trans. I'm glad about that.
I'm honestly fearful for all of my American trans sisters and brothers. Still not perfect but in the UK being trans is a protected characteristic under hate crime laws along with sexual orientations and ethnicity or subculture.

Even so I wish there had been at least some education about lgbt+ when I was in school.
If there had been I'd not have suffered and tried to take my own life so many times before finally being clued up not just on lgbt but exactly what it means to be transgender and that I'm not a monster nor ""broken""
I’m against the idea of teaching a kid this or even introducing this same as bible in school I feel as a parent you need to educate those situations. I love the gay community and have no issue with my kid asking questions or even being gay. What I don’t like is a group and I mean any group telling someone what they should feel or think and this goes across all fields.
The ""Don't Day Gay"" bill reminds me of an action in 1992 NYC on a very similar matter, where a provocative activist group, the Lesbian Avengers, handed out balloons that had ""Ask About Lesbian Lives"" printed on them.    

A four minute video from the [action](https://youtu.be/dzIbGdP7MDQ)
If I had been taught that shit in middle school I would have 1) transitioned earlier and 2) feel so much less gross since I wouldnt have discovered being trans was a thing by stumbling across porn
I think things would’ve been really different for me. I probably would’ve started pursuing transition in high school or college. I didn’t realize transitioning was a real thing. My only exposure to trans people was transphobic jokes in film and tv, and my family making fun of Chaz Bono. And a little later we started entering the cringe and anti-SJW era or the Internet, which I now realize was mostly just making fun of trans, gay, neurodivergent, furry, etc. folk. If I had seen celebrities who were trans or text books with photos of average trans people, and if I had known about the possibilities then I probably would’ve realized that my feelings were actionable. 

Same thing with sexual/romantic stuff. Maybe I would’ve gone out with those cute possibly bi boys who I now realize were repeatedly flirting with me in high school. Even as someone who has an explicitly homosexual person in their family, gayness seemed like a different universe at the time. Prior to adulthood, there were only a handful of people I’d ever met who were out of the closet, and they were both the stereotypical gay man and lesbian, and simultaneously social pariahs. So like, if I saw the wide variety of ways gay folk can be then maybe I and the undoubtedly many other queers in my high school would’ve felt empowered to be ourselves. 

Even beyond gay stuff, I might’ve been more sexually open if I had been told that sex other than PiV sex is cool. Like, if I had been told I didn’t need to penetrate my partner just because I have a dick then maybe I would’ve been more amenable to the idea of having sex. 

There’s a lot of ways that people could benefit from even just a little more education. I know I could have, and I’m positive that I’m not the only one.
In the UK LGBTQ+ stuff wasn't able to be taught in schools until section 28 law was repelled in 2004 when I was 14. So I had no education on queer people, and I wasn't good at the internet I did come out to myself when I was 19 but put myself back in the closet when I found out how hostile people here are..... Then I came out properly in 2019....when hostilities towards trans people is far worse. 

I am lucky that I have a fairly feminine face but I still get started at a lot...
whats the context on said bill? i havent heard of it yet (i am european)
I never hid who I was. I got beaten and spit on for it, but I never hid the fact that I was transgender. I think that having an education including trans awareness would have at least made me feel less like an alien. I just never thought that I fit in at all.
Yeah I didn't figure it out til I was like 27 cause I just didn't know the options. Would've saved myself a lot of misery if I'd been informed earlier.
Hey I passed my style off as emo too back then, yet I am transitioning now days. Thought I was the only one who did that hehe.
I was raised Jehovah Witness and learned early to not talk about ""those feelings"". I barely knew how to put those feelings together except that I thought good would kill me because of them. I wish I had proper education and maybe I could have started transitioning earlier in life.
If I had actually been taught (properly) about LGBTQ+ it’s not an exaggeration to say that my life would have been drastically improved. I probably would have realized I was trans way earlier. I also could have cleared up my confusion with my sexuality sooner. 

I literally think about it all the time how if someone in an educational/therapy setting asked me the “button question” at a younger age my egg would have immediately cracked. Just like we screen kids for all aspects of their life, physical, mental well being etc, there should be a “screening” for gender dysphoria. I had all the signs but didn’t put it together because I had to discover it on my own.
Sorry that I haven’t been paying attention but what bill?
honestly would have been amazing for me and a lot of my old class mates, would have created a more accepting enviroment, and i would have started questioning my identity sooner, that is assuming the best ofc, it would have helped me a lot
Well, I was actually taught about trans people in middle school. At age 14. We saw some documentary about it. But it took me a further 3 years to realise that I was trans, after I got in the same class as my now best friend who’s also trans. I had a lot of signs of being trans but I never pieced it together before meeting someone else who was and hearing about their experiences
I've struggled with mental health since I was about 6 years old, pretty much when I realized people were forcing me to be a girl and the entirety of society had their back. I was defiant about dresses, the color pink, marriage, etc. I came to resent femininity as a whole and became toxic to my lady friends who began to explore overtly feminine presentations. I was around enough good people to cut that shit out, but the wound remained.

Only at 30 years old did I realize that nonbinary was an identity. I spent more than two decades filled with resentment and pain that could have been entirely avoided if that was presented as an option. I probably would have been more comfortable with people different than me (feminine people). 

I was always confused because I never wanted to remove body parts, and that's the story of trans people I was sold. ""Being trans is when your body doesn't match your brain,"" said my trans male best friend. I fully believed him in the name of solidarity, but that narrative kept me stuck in no man's land for longer than necessary.

The growth of the trans conversation during COVID has saved me from a lot of hate. It needs to happen. Queer people will keep existing, whether we acknowledge it or not, and the sooner we accept that reality, the healthier society will be.
I would be sitting around. Depressed, wondering what was wrong with me. 

Did the bill get passed?
they're passing a bill that makes it illegal to talk about LGBT people? pardon my ignorance as I'm out of touch with politics (for good reason), but if that's really it then that's fucking hilarious.

the party of ""free speech"" finally mobilizing and limiting free speech when they don't like it. how long do you think it'd take until the ""I'm standing up for our oppressed rights!"" crowd finally starts building labor camps and throwing minorities into them under the guise of ""degeneracy"" or ""protecting the country"" or whatever nonsense?

my god it really is like Lord of the Flies out here.
the only reason my school has ever brought Lgbt in a positive light, was the fact they were legally required to.
I'm really happy for you. My story has a lot of parallels and I totally agree with you. Had there been better LGBT, emphasis on the T education when I was younger it would have saved me decades of misery.

I hope we can get it right for the kids that are just starting now so they don't have to go through all of that.
I’m wishing for a positive teaching of people who are different to accept them or shall I say us gays crossdressing and transgender all of us our bodies are for us not others to tell us how we should be
I'm just getting started at age 23 and didn't start properly asking the questions I needed to until I was freaking 20 for the same reason. I pretended I was a girl online for a couple years before this and never made the connection. I just had no idea trans people existed. First I ever heard of it was Jenner and... I have a lot of negative feelings about her that I'll set aside right now, but- yeah my exposure was limited. What's worse is I grew up in a southern conservative town. Boys were gay (which in that town was a bad thing, they felt) if they wore a pink shirt even once. The only reason I even thought to try was because my friends in college put me in a dress and it just... clicked that something was so, so right about it.

Had there been education, I'd have been able to start teaching myself how to pursue my transition even sooner. Mom still wouldn't have approved and I'd have still had to escape that damn town, but I'd have probably started at least a couple years sooner.

Education is essential.
Lots different.
I can't say whether I would have realized I was trans significantly sooner, but there at least would have been *a chance*. Maybe knowing that there were *options* would have led me to idly question just out of ""curiosity"", and maybe I would have realized ""Wait, that...sounds kind of nice, actually?""
I would just have figured out that I liked men, women, and enbys way earlier than I did. Never really cared about who I was attracted to, I just got attracted to people. As for my gender, I probably wouldn't have lost the one person I've dated that I aftually loved because of misinformation, and I would have figured out my gender like, 2 years earlier .
Such a disgusting fascist bill
As I'm still somewhat new to the LGBTQ+ scene I had no idea what is/ has happening/happened in LGBT politics. Had no interest in it, regular politics much less. So I did some looking up on this and holy hell. I'm horrified by the thought processes of some of the more prominent Republicans.

That being said: I would have been able to start exploring this part of me much, much, MUCH earlier in my life. I had known being transgender was a thing only after Kaitlyn Jenner was the big name in media. At that point I still didn't understand what it was. Until recent years it was still so alien to me. Until transgender rights advocating was really being shown in media, I didn't understand the jealousy I held for the girls in my school growing up, my sisters, and other women I had in my life.

I've had multiple thoughts of attempting suicide growing up because being dead was better than hating myself, seeing a stranger in the mirror. But as the years went on and I felt more and more ashamed of who I was. I forgot about it. I forced myself to play a role. So much that I ended up repressing my identity crisis and essentially forgot about my feelings. I still had the dreams though.

Last year my egg cracked, I don't know what caused it, how it happened, but I started remembering all of these repressed feelings.

I wish I had known sooner.

But...
If I had, I wouldn't have the greatest love in my life, my son. I wouldn't have the friends I do now. I wouldn't have the most supportive and loving partner I've ever had the joy to love. And if transitioning much earlier in my life meant losing what I hold dearest in my heart now,  no thanks.
I thought the bill was going to be killed like the last time? I haven't heard of it getting any traction in The house or Senate outside if the same small group that supported it the last time?
I didn't knowingly meet a trans person until I was 28 when a girl at my work came out. My egg cracked 3 months later, meeting Zoey saved my life, it snapped me out of that disassociative fugue state I had lived in until then. If I had known earlier I wouldn't have missed my life up until now.
Gonna throw my story on the same pile of ""(a few months before) 22 wasn't a bad age, but 15 would have been a lot better"", because that's basically what my story was too.
Well since I live in the UK where it wasn't discussed but everyone accepted that queer people exist no I don't think education on LGBTQ+ topics would've helped me what would've helped me is instead of being forced to learn pythagoris theorem which I never did learn because it confused me and because my country's response to neurodivergent kids is to stick them in a special school where they learn primary school level maths in their 3rd year of high school learning about my country's history would've been much more worthwhile since I'd actually remember that but no instead we were taught about the evils of the British Empire abroad and absolutely nothing about the evils of the British Empire committed against it's own people and yes of course the evils of the British Empire abroad is important to learn about I never learned about how the English soldiers butchered Scottish civilians based on nothing more than a suspicion that they were a rebel which guess what a lot of the time the English soldiers did suspect a peasant farmer to be a rebel so what they'd do is burn down the peasant's farm leaving them destitute if they were lucky if they were unlucky they'd be killed or arrested and tortured the English's hatred of the Scots was unleashed on full display during the Jacobite Rebellions
I feel like there is still a distinct lack of education around the LGBTQIA+ community. I was doing research around the trans community and only JUST discovered that being born with another genders brain ISN'T just a metaphor, and is actually how the brain develops. I feel if we had this education ready in classroom environments there would be more acceptance around this beautiful community and less drama about small niches in the wider community.
I would've known I was trans
Had this been a thing that was taught at young ages, I would have been able to start doing stuff about it back in 2nd grade when I first started experiencing these feelings. 

I think it’s a great idea to teach about it before there are the effects of puberty that make transitioning so difficult at later ages. And any part of the process that happens when you’re a kid is completely reversible, so the ones who mistakenly think themselves to be trans can just stop at any time and just continue on like nothing happened. This would help many LGBTQIA+ people and would not cause any negative effects for anyone who is cishet.
Very disappointing to hear about this. I have not heard of this ""Don't Say Gay"" bill until now. Like you, I would have known I was trans much earlier if I was simply educated on the subject. I would have been transitioning for at least a decade by now if there was proper education on being LGBTQIA+. Your story brought up a repressed memory of mine. Despite going through a journey of skepticism at the same time, I also found a website full of spells and attempted to use them to change my sex. You would email them and ask them to preform a spell for you, and I begged them to please turn me female, even if only for a day. I guess in a way I got my wish, just a little later and with far more time and energy 😅
I was told in middle school, public education early 2000s, that you cannot change your gender or like people of the same sex or gender.
The school shunned and frowned upon individuality.
I lost many friends from self harm and suicide due to such a negative stigma around it.

I feel if LGBTQIA+ topics were discussed and supported in schools I wouldn't have had to mourn the loss of so many of my friends.
I probably wouldn't have waited till I was in my 30s to transition out of fear of being murdered, beaten or disowned by my family.
Still to this day my childhood upbringing effects me with internalized issues that will take years of therapy to overcome.

The people I work with and clients that I interact with don't treat me with nearly the respect that I believe I would recieve if they were raised with a level of acceptance and understanding of LGBT+ issues.

I wish for a better future for all kids in this country. It's the future they deserve yet some butt hurt politicians would rather see LGBT folk dead or suffering physical and emotional trauma than create a healthier nation for everyone.
I probably would have known I was a man earlier. Growing up I never quite thought about my gender very much, part from being annoyed at how different I was treated from the boys just because they said I was a girl. I knew of trans people but the few stories I heard didn't match my own experience and so it didn't occur to me that I was trans. 

I've lived a pretty turbulent life, bouncing around from work to work around every 3 to 6 months for most of my young adult life and never really had the time or energy to reflect on my gender and identity. It wasn't until I was almost 30 that my life settled more down and I had interactions with people that forced me to take a hard look at myself. And I fought against it because of various reasons. It wasn't until I by pure chance joined a few non binary groups on Facebook that I found people with similar experiences. It changed my world. 

I'm now 32, turning 33 this year. I've legally changed my name, working on the papers to change my gender and have an appointment with the gender clinic in May to hopefully start T this year. I wish I had known earlier. Cause thinking back I have suffered from dysphoria all my life, I just didn't know it. And it's also probably the reason for my lifelong depression. 

I'm also asexual. I thought I was broken. Again I knew about asexuals but the only info I could find was that ace people are repulsed by sex. And I don't fit in there either. There really needs to be better education on lgbt matters cause that can help someone like me not feel broken and damaged
Same — most of my life was spent saying everyone calls me a boy, so I must be a boy? Guess I’ll just suck it up and make the best of things. I simply didn’t know that I had any other options. 

I don’t think my sex ed was particularly anti-LGBT (I grew up in CA in the 90s) but I don’t particularly remember trans people being a topic. I’m not sure if learning more would have helped any — I suspect figuring it out in high school would have been too much for me — but I wish I had learned more about the topic at an earlier age. Maybe I would have spent more of my life actually living.
I tried to kill myself at least a dozen times before I was 16. I'm from Omaha and the extent of knowledge I had growing up about transitioning was 1.That I was probably going to be stuck as a boy forever. And 2.That if I somehow magically transitioned, I'd end up a gross punchline of a sick joke about a ""chick with a dick"" or ""dude dressed like a lady"". The only reason I began to understand why I'd always known I was in the wrong body, crossdressed, stuffed my shirts, tried on my mom's clothes, etc, is because I figured out how to clear the internet search history and would continuously google ""I want to be a girl"" when no one was home. I remember reading articles about a young Kim Petras and thinking, ""yeah, I'm just like her. I'm not broken and I'm not a monster"" just the sheer knowledge that other trans people existed was enough to quell my most self destructive thoughts. Education matters, and kids are confused as hell sometimes due to plain old lack of education on these subjects. All this legislation that lawmakers are trying to push is just so disheartening and I feel that in the majority public eye, us trans folk are still in the ""it's just a decision"" phase, implying that we are all just cis people actively choosing to be trans. UGGHHHHH. The world pisses me off.
I'm so happy that you ended up being able to be yourself and not have to worry that you aren't 'normal' or whatever. But it pisses me off that people just don't educate their kids or students about this kind of stuff, and even (like with this bill) ban the topics from being discussed altogether. I was so scared and confused when I was younger because I had always known I was a boy, but my family was Christian, I live in the South, and it was hard to find help. Luckily I had some great friends who educated me and helped me be who I am today. 

This bill absolutely disgusts me and makes me want to puke. Especially with so many people supporting it. (TW) Do they realize that this bill will probably end up causing a lot of LGBGTQ+ kids to commit suicide because they felt like you and me did - alone, scared, confused, and hurting?
I had no idea that nonbinary people existed for most of my life. I knew for most of my childhood that I ""wasn't like most boys"" but I also didn't feel like a girl so I had no idea where I fit in. It probably doesn't help that my first exposure to trans people was through pornography, so you can imagine what my perception of the trans experience was. I could never see myself like that, so even as I got older and learned more about trans people I still didn't think that could be me. I had a period of time where I described myself as ""90% man"" and I wonder if things would be better now if I had known what nonbinary means back then.

I also had no idea people could actually be asexual. I just thought I was ""more mature"" than my peers because I didn't get distracted by sexual attraction, when it was really that I didn't even feel sexual attraction. I even had someone in high school call me asexual once, although it was from a position of ignorance as they compared me to an amoeba, and it took a long time for me to separate that experience from the concept of asexuality because I had to educate myself.

As a nonbinary educator, this bill would almost certainly mean the death of my involvement with the public school system. I'm just so nervous that the mere act of asking students to use they/them pronouns for me could lead to conflict with some parents. I have a few contacts at the school district so I can talk to them about options, but I don't want a misguided bill to ruin such an important part of my life.
One thing first off, can you elaborate on the 'don't say gay' bill you mentioned and on how/where it's possibly passing? I'm not familar at all- 🙃

I agree wholeheartedly though. If I had trans-positive information about trans people from a young age and it was just common knowlege, I would've gotten to start actually *living* already. I was an egg for such a long time;

\- I 'pretended' to be a girl on omegle all the time for no consious reason, though I probably rationalized that 'oh most people don't even talk to men on this site so I have to say F if I wanna talk to anyone' even though most people I ended up talking to were horny and talking to people there wasn't always the most plesant thing.- every D&D character I've ever played as has been a woman- I tended to play female characters in games- My friends were categorizing our group into Naruto Akatsuki members in HS and I got Kisame because I like water powers a lot, but I hated 'being' him (I rationalized it that I don't like his character), and I asked them if I could be Konan instead, even though they already assigned another one of us to be her because she's a girl.- I then proceded to COSPLAY Konan for Haloween that year- I joined an RP discord server and my character was a girl, and they assumed I was a girl bc I apparently type like a girl, and that made me happy. I invited some IRL friends to the server too, and told them to not tell them my name or that I was a guy (because I wasn't, little did she know- haha).- I straight up had thoughts for a couple months in like freshman/sophmore year of HS that were straight up 'man my life would be so much better if I was a girl' and 'geez it would be so awesome if I could be a girl' and 'wow I wish I could be a girl that'd be so great'. And those thoughts only faded away when my emotional plate filled up more and I had less space to think about it.

The exposure I had to trans people was t-slurs in anime, and my friend dated someone one time who came out as transmasc and he told us about it (but I never connected the dots). Besides casual transphobia and awful exposure that I'm sure I was exposed to but have no memory of, that's it, that's all I can remember.

Then when a content creator I liked a lot (Eskay) came out as trans, I was like 'yo thats awesome!! I'm happy for her!' and then the next several months was a very very slow and gradule ""wait-""

I don't have much memory of my childhood, but had I been exposed to trans-positive info and been educated about trans people as they are and not the shitty stuff like t-slurs in anime and stuff, I probably could have come out much sooner. Not that I know for sure, but possibly even when I was in the single digits.

That would have changed my life. I won't go into it, but I feel Existential Dysphoria really fucking hard. Shit sucks :(

*(*[*the idea of Existential Dysphoria is explained here by the Gender Dysphoria Bible*](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/existential-dysphoria) *(amazing resource go read doesn't matter if you're trans or not))*
As I am a knowledge whore, I would have loved to learn about this far earlier. Knowledge shouldn't be shunned because some people disagree or don't like it.

I didn't really take good care of myself, or care in school, I half assed everything (except my personal interests). I even dropped out like 3 months before graduating highschool cause I couldn't be bothered, and I was completely apathetic towards basically everything and everyone. In the last ~6 months, after coming out as nonbinary, and then realizing I'm a trans woman, I've taken so much better care of myself, mentally, physically (maybe I'm still a little lazy), emotionally, hygienically, etc. I feel better as a person, and I started actually caring about life in general. I can't imagine how much that could have changed me to realize earlier on, idk if all of these are directly linked, but thinking about the doors I closed because I didn't care and was generally unhappy is saddening. And if I came out as trans earlier maybe I my life would be completely different.

Learning about LGBT+ is literally life changing for some people.
I completely agree. Finding out certain things are options only open the door for those who are already inclined to do so. Finding out writing with you left hand doesn't magically turn right-handed people into lefties. At most, they'd try it once and realize it isn't a good fit. Same goes for gender and sexuality. There might be a handful who try the new option briefly, and realize it doesn't fit them. For sexuality, that might mean a date/one night stand/or just imagining what it would be like. For gender, it might be a new haircut, new clothes, or at the very worst (and lowest percentage) medical transitioning before realizing it was a mistake. But that, along with forcing yourself to use you left hand when you are right-handed (or vice versa), comes down to some other factors, just as the small percentage of detransitioners are still mostly trans people forced to detransition due to social factors (left-handed people forcing themselves to write with their right hand to avoid punishment/ostrization/etc.). But even then, the vast majority won't even try out 'writing with their left hand', because they know that isn't who they are. 

For me, I didn't know trans men existed until my mid-twenties. I had heard all the awful, transphobic rhetoric about trans women growing up in a fundamental christian religion/conservative area. And I believed it. I never understood why anyone, let alone someone born with the body type/anatomy I always wanted, would want to be a woman. I had convinced myself that most women were basically resigned to their fates, because that's how I felt in my body. But then I found out trans guys existed. Suddenly, I didn't have to be resigned anymore. I could get the deeper voice I always wanted. I could gain the same muscle as cis guys working out as much as I was. I could grow facial hair. I could have a flat chest, or even a penis, the smell of a guy, the internal body heat of a guy, and so, so much more stuff. Stuff I always wanted, always saw that I SHOULD have, that my brain expected to have. And once I saw it that way, I could easily see how trans woman would want the same but reversed. The same way I finally understood that women, cis or trans, were just as comfortable in their bodies as guys are in theirs. It just wasn't the right fit for me. I finally got to write with my left hand (metaphorically, in this case). 

If I had known earlier, I still likely wouldn't have been able to transition much earlier. The house I grew up in...it never would have happened as a minor. And the only way I left was by joining the military, which also isn't the best environment. Still, knowing earlier would have improved a lot of mental health issues for me, just knowing transitioning was a future possibility. We can't go back and change our past. The only thing we can do is make the present and future better for those who come after us. This bill would do the opposite of that, and deserves every bit of opposition and criticism it gets. More, to be honest. I always thought it was pretty ironic that the 'right' are rarely ever on the 'right side of history', either in the present or when looking back on the past.
Cool so more people might have the possibility of ending up dead or in the hospital several times from people tryin to kill them. Happened to me. All happened in high school. Went thru 6 before I found one where I was just a nobody rather than being tormented, punched, stabbed, drag by my book bag from a running vehicle...having my arm broken and my jaw dislocated and called every name in the book.
And never had one teacher on my side. Was it cus they were scared or were they just as fucked up as the kids I went to school with ..guess I'll never know LOL
100%. they should be held liable when bad things happen. I wouldnt doubt we see a rise in suicide. Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports. 

Though we all know, theyll blame those suicides on being LGBTQ rather than their own ignorance pushing people off the ledge.
>but are fine with dead kids

they love dead trans kids! what are you talking about?

less people to be disgusted with is obviously what they want.
100% where I'm at rn. I really feel like I got cheated out of the last 20 years. I really wish I could go back and relive them as a woman, or even as a trans woman with the knowledge I have now. :/
Hard same. My trans education was watching Ace Ventura at 9 years old, and it shoved me into the closet for 26 more years. I’d give almost anything to get that time back.

I wonder every day what my life would have been like if I’d had access to the resources trans kids have today. Taking them away is ignorant, irresponsible and cruel. Those kids will still be trans, they just won’t realize why everything in their life seems lifeless and empty.

It’s child abuse, pure and simple.
Sounds like a good idea until you realize Gathering a strongly hated population into a small building is a recipe for hate crimes and arson etc. tis a shite world we live in
Haven't multiple countries tried this before with black people and white people?
I ran for a few years in being asexual too. Eventually realized it's because I just wan unable to come to terms with using the equipment I was born with. Why would I want to have sex with these bits? I don't even want these bits. 

Now I feel like I'm stuck with a sexual awakening while transitioning. Just doing everything 10 years too late.
Something that helps me is to remember that just because my brain is done *growing*, it never stops *changing*. I have PTSD and that hope is what keeps me going. I'm a better person than I was last year or 5 years ago even though I'm a full-ass adult.
omg im crying! Im glad my post has helped you so much! i wish you the best in your journey :)
Same here +10 years... *sigh*
Exactly!
How is a bill like this on it’s way to getting passed in present day?
I agree with your general sentiment but I think the logic starts forming cracks when you get into the details. 

When we put queer kids into context, they exist whether we teach them about themselves or not. 1 in 6 children in the US are facing child abuse regardless of identity. That number gets bigger with queer kids.

So, more than 16% of school kids have unsupportive families right out the gate. More than 16% literally do not have guardians that will teach them much of anything. So society *does* have a major role in the education of themselves & their identity. Society has neglected that role, and that's one of many reasons why queer kids have hard lives.

In other contexts, that can apply to black kids who feel out of place & not understanding why, or even positive things like encouraging the trades or STEM or teaching empathy and social conduct. Kids need society to fill in for the failures of their families, regardless of how we feel about interest groups. 

I know you support the gay community as a concept and I think you were alluding to keeping religion's values out of the classroom (which I completely agree with). But I've seen this kind of logic used against the queer community as well, so I think it's important to look at that.
lmao its insane how many of us have gone through a lot of the same stuff!
A bill that would ban education/talks regarding LGBTQ stuff in school
Passed the house, i believe
it passed in the house, if im not mistaken
wtf that’s a total breach of privacy letting them check KIDS genitals. wtf is wrong with this country.
>Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports.

What the actual hell.
it’s already bad enough going to the doctor for the yearly check up shit and having them look at your dick you never wanted
Correction- They love dead trans kids, they don't care if the kid is cis.
Feels!
Ah but you see the cruelty is the point. Conservatives need someone to oppress in order to feel good about themselves. Now they're even going after the Furry community.
i did not think about that. maybe school officers and stuff? we have those in normal schools here anyways
Because we live in a world of immoral sadists who only act on impulse
Well said.
The right wingers are the real pedophile cabal and are just projecting it on LGBTQ/leftists/etc... via conspiracy theories to shift the blame from themselves.
TLDR: a lot
Yeah we don't want to start on the rabbit hole that is ""what's wrong with the United States"" unless you have actual days to burn. It'd be far easier to list what *isn't* wrong than what is.
I will say that when I first heard about this I thought they meant like literally having them drop their pants in front of some gym coach and was terrified, but I'm at least thankful it's not that (of course this is still a trash idea tho). Last I heard, they just want a doctor's confirmation or a letter or smth that the kid is indeed a girl/boy and that they're not being ""brainwashed"" or smth by their parents or on hrt 🙄
I remember learning this, god it still makes me wanna puke
There is no way this will pass Constitutional muster.
yeah my bad
Sadly schools with police on site have higher rates of incarceration and police brutality for black and POC kids for infractions that white kids get detention for and the queer community isn't exempt from racist attitudes that fuel the school to prison pipelines.

We shouldn't have to all be the same to get respect and honestly it'd just set kids up for failure once they leave school and their hit with all the homophobia from people who liked us better when we segregated far away from them.
Just make it a secret gay school we will send invitations to all the gays via pigeon
Unfortunately they're inefficient as it is. It'd probably be worse
I mean they’re standard in every school, but that’s not gonna stop a legion of inbred dudes from states you’ve never heard of from converging on the school and overwhelming the 3 police officers. It would be impractical in our current society, lgbt clubs should be a standard practice tho
true tho
I'm trying to think, fuel prices maybe. Though that is slowly cooking the planet so maybe that's wrong too? But yeah, most of the essential things in the US are a bit a dumpster fire.
yay i love the gay pigeons!

Looking great otherwise love.
Oh my god you look terrific! Good on you. You were very brave. Kudos.
Congratulations! I'm so happy for you and proud if you.
I love that dress and you look so good in it!!!
I feel so happy for you! Happy you have such a great relationship and I can only imagine the weight that is off your sholders now
That’s a very hot dress and you look amazing in it!!! 💝💝💝💋💋💋
you look great! That dress suits you
That's so cute! The dress looks great on you!
So great❤️
Cute dress. Looks good on you.
Thank you!
No! I think I might be intersex, but I haven’t been tested yet. I was supposed to be on hrt already but the virus hit and my appointment was cancelled :(
Chances are that's a minor
It was tough, but I made it easier by easing into it over a few weeks
You might see if your doctor will do telemedicine at this point. I know some places cancelled in visit appointments before they had telemedicine available. While I had an in visit before all this occured to get my initial stuff underway, I was able to do telemedicine with the actual doctor who gave me my approval for the hormones.  You would just likely have to get blood work somehow then.
I had an appointment online so call and see if they can do that. They actually just started me on T Tuesday so I think it’s possible
How can you tell? Anyways, deleted the comment.  Thanks for the head's up.
Ok, what do you  mean by that? Thanks in advance
I started by talking about liking certain things, and slowly worked towards letting her know I had clothes in my room, then finally when she asked if I was trans I came out.
Ok thanks"	gbbqho	trans	1251	1.0	2020-05-01 04:42:26
I'm straight but I really really want to wear girls clothes but I have been straight my whole life so idk and I also want to act like a girl can someone please help		"Sexual orientation and gender identity are very different things. You can be straight and Trans or gender nonconforming. Wear whatever makes you the happiest. You’re the only person you’ll have to see every day for the rest of your life. No one else’s opinion about it matters.
The term ‘transbian’ is quite common.

Go for it and be with a girl
Find some femme movies that you've always kinda wanted to watch, go buy a cute t-shirt in the women's section, get some snacks, and indulge in the experience :)
*egg cracking sounds* 

Oh do I have news for you.
Transgender lesbian
Sorry, I do not have any advice to give but the image kind of looks like kuruko from kuruko’s basketball anime.
You can be a guy who wears feminine clothes. That's totally a thing. 

You could also be a gay woman. 

You could also be somewhere in between.

It's your life. You get to choose how you identify and present yourself.
I'm so proud of you for coming here with this!

If you want to act like a girl you should do it! Even if it's just online every little bit of affirmation can help you in finding yourself

If you are a trans girl which you very much might be you are a lesbian! I'm a trans girl who likes girls and so I'm a lesbian so the same goes for you!

It'll all be ok please don't worry about this

You're pretty and beautiful and i know you'll do great things once you are fully yourself
r/eggirl
You can wear women's clothes and still be straight and male, it's perfectly normal nowadays to be a crossdresser
Who your attracted to has nothing to do with what you wear honey. Clothes are clothes if you like them wear them! ♥️
Could be a femboi who's attracted to women, could be a lesbian. I recommend thinking hard about who you are, and who you want to be.
Sexuality and gender are very different. You can be straight but not cis or you could be cis and not straight or cis and straight or whatever else. But even then if you want to wear feminine clothes but still feel like a guy, then you are still a guy
could just be a femboy, a male with feminine traits who likes to wear feminine clothes
You can be a femboy and still be straight...
You don't need help... you need expirience First....
Try it about a few months... and if you are happy with it... do it.
Every gender has doubts. We all learning....
Some people just never ask themselves these question....
Gender expression is separate from sexuality. You shouldn’t feel bad about how you want to express yourself at all
There’s nothing wrong with you or your feelings. 

Don’t start thinking there’s something wrong with you for having perfectly normal feelings.

Try to be accepting of yourself!

That is all, thank you!
For my part, I've understand that I was lesbian before understanding that I'm trans (MtF) i don't know how and why but I always feel like i was liking girls like a lesbian and not like straight men. So there was a part of my life that i was happy to hear that a woman was lesbian/bi and felt like i could flirt with them, but I was still thinking i was a men (and that's why I've never tried to get a girlfriend before transitioning)
Just try whatever feels good. If something is making you uncomfortable then stop. Try some new things and experiment with your identity. Lastly, there’s no rush. Don’t get down on yourself if you feel you aren’t making the mental progress that you had hoped. Lastly, we are here for you if you ever need us. ❤️
You could be a femboy they aren’t always gay it’s just a male who likes acting more feminine but is still male
this really sounds like gender nonconformity, and there's nothing wrong with that.
Just do it don’t care what people think it’s liberating
Hello honey 💋 you know! The clothes that you wear don't define your sexuality, if you want to wear girls clothes then you do it and if you are not hurting anyone then you act like a girl all you want, once upon a time in this world before they invented trousers men wore hose and everyone had long hair, men wore shapewear (corsetry🥰) because of poor diet, everyone powdered their face, the list is endless honey and my point is that we are only on this earth for a little while so why waste the time conforming to stereotypes, if you want encouragement then you put on your girl clothes and stand in front of the mirror, you will not find a greater compliment than that. Christine 💋
Crossdressing and being straight is valid, being MtF and WLW is also valid, just do a little self exploration you'll work it out and whatever you find with yourself that's great. It's like one of the good things Dr Seuss said; *Be who you are and say how you feel, because those who mind don’t matter, and those who matter don’t mind.*
Im married. And yeah. Its fine.
Maybe ur just a femboy inside
sexuality has nothing to do with gender! you could be a girl who likes girls, or a guy who likes dressing and acting femininely but is still a straight guy. If someone asks you are you a girl or a boy (on the inside, not physically) are you confident youre a guy? Do you get dysphoria from presenting masculine? (not a must, some trans people dont experience dysphoria)
Yeahh I'm straight (mostly), but I like wearing girls clothes, you're valid to be this way haha, because technically if you transitioned, you would be a ""transbian"", a trans lesbian
Egg moment
There's no such thing as ""girls clothes"", all clothes are ok for any gender, and there's definitely no way to act like a girl. My girlfriend is trans and she's 100% a girl but she wears jeans and flannels, doesn't wear makeup, and she doesn't ""act"" in a stereotypically feminine way either. Girls can be masculine too.

And same goes for guys, guys can be feminine!

If you want to figure out if you're a girl, think about whether it's the identifying as a girl part that you like, or whether you just want to be feminine.
Account suspended
If you are trans m2f and like girls too you are a lesbian and there's nothing wrong with that just cause you are trans doesn't mean you have to like men.
There are no such thing as girls’ clothes. They’re just clothes.
It's called a femboy, and there are lots of women into femboys
I diagnose you with woman
you can be straight and trans at the same time
crossdressing is also Valid if you don't think you're trans <3  
Don't ever feel tied to labels!
This was a reply to a different thread but I think it also answers your question: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/phc2zf/i\_recently\_came\_out\_as\_trans\_mtf\_but\_i\_still\_like/hbhnz7k?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web2x&context=3
Straight =/= wanting to be a girl 
But you could also be a femboy
But your egg may have also cracked...

Id say its time for someone to research and experiment!! Good luck on your journey! Wish you the best!
🥚
There's still females that are into that. No reason to feel ashamed or anything problematic. I was just thinking earlier today that has my ex asked me to wear a dress when i asked her to wear one(because she despised them) i probably would've done it for her. She was a really cool, and sure she still is just not together. ANYWAY, back to you, there's nothing wrong with that at all. Everyone's got their preferences. 
If it helps why not start off with like a kilt and see how you feel around it public or not.
Then you a lesbian honey
Have definitely felt this. ftm lesbian girls are valid and so are you!
This reminds me of that post I drafted and didn’t have the service to send after i started crossdressing and really liking how I felt after. Honestly if it had sent I would have probably known I was trans 6 months earlier but i just stayed ignorant to myself
Clothes aren't actually gendered c:
Wear whatever makes you happiest!
Im happy for you girl!!! 
I hope all of it wasnt too confusing and go wear what you want to wear. People have opinions anyways dont bother and be you❤🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🖤
A lot of my trans friends are straight. Gender identity and orientation are separate. Good luck 😸
I am pretty sure its not illegal to wear clothes of the opposite gender so maybe start there, also this is a requirement for hormone therapy for the most part and be prepared to be discriminated against and refused bathroom privileges,health care and other challenges etc.
 There are often costs associated with changing genders if you care about blending or passing as some people refer to it such as makeup, surgery, accessories and so on.  Its one thing to act like a girl and something totally different to act like a lady or woman.. ideally you want to represent your true inner self on the outside too

As far as I know I am straight too but perhaps there are more things at play.  For example since I am unable to have sex right now with my mutilated body and compromised parts my only option is to have a vaginoplasty...

Also there is a difference between heterogender and heterosexual btw..
Good luck.
You know im going to do it I figured it out im transgender
Well if I'm trans (mtf) and I like still like females would that make me transbian
Oh I love this idea! Do you have some movie recommendations :D?
I'm out of the closet now
What?
Oh ya omg is this canon
Similar experience here, other direction. I knew I liked men in a gay way and women in a straight way for a long time. Now I'm nonbinary trans.
Wonder what happened
Congrats! Keep working on being the happiest and most authentic you and everything will work out. If there are any speed bumps along the way this community is here for you.🏳️‍⚧️😁
Omg the trans and lesbian flags haha egg crack speedrun any%
I’m happy for you i remember figuring it out I felt so good
Take a look at https://genderdysphoria.fyi 

It really helped when I came out.
Welcome to the world out side your shell! its a big world out here its not all of its kind or friendly but its worth it :)

A big egg cracking noise
Congrats. Im happy for you
Well that was fast
Congrats!!
that's awesome! so happy for you!
Yep! If you are a trans girl who likes girls, then you are a lesbian
Welcome to the world of womanhood! We're more than happy to help you out with anything you may need~
:) I guess depends on what you're into. Some that I've liked:

- Matilda for when needing childhood nostalgia

- Ever After for when I'm into renaissance period pieces

- Sense 8 for when I wanna binge a super queer kinda sci Fi show with a badass hacker trans woman

- Girl Interrupted for when I'm feeling crazy troubled and misunderstood

- Miss Congeniality for when... I dunno I'm a millenial and this just did it for me when I was a kid

- Dirty Dancing for when I'm feeling 80s angst

- Boy Meets Girl for when I actually just need to see a trans woman in a kinda bad but endearing romcom

- Bridgerton for when I want a modern period piece with hot guys and sex scenes and dialogue that clearly puts the women's experience first

- Beauty and the Beast (live action) was my fav movie when I was recovering from orchi. So good

And ya those are some of what I've enjoyed :)
Congrats!!!
*egg fucking explodes* 

Woo Hoo!!
If you choose to identify as a girl and you like girls that makes you a lesbian.
I hope so but I very much doubt it.
Lmao yesss I noticed that too
Awww thanks
Do you have discord? we can be friends
This. I'd just add that you might want to work on it during alone time, there were parts that had me sobbing unexpectedly.
Can you dm me your discord?
Lol.  No kidding. I sort of used it at the airport and a plane. Though I realized I don’t mind crying in public…..at least when I don’t have a mask to get filled with snot.  COVID really ruins everything doesn’t it."	phatlf	trans	1242	0.99	2021-09-03 18:22:19

Cute young lady
No offence but I'm getting serious belle Delphine vibes, but 10/10 go girl
On a 1-10 scale. A 9. You look very feminine.
Based on that alone, I never would have guessed you were not born female.
You look gorgeous lady!

Brain says: oo cute girl
Cute af
Simply Amazing !!!
You pass if that's what you're aiming for.
honey you look great!
You already look feminine without hormones. Imagine how much more feminine you'll look with hormones.
You look gorgeous, but in a way that shows you probably have a stunning, kind, funny, personality. I get the sorts of vibes that you know how to stand your ground, whilst listening to other people's views, and bringing forth your own view points. Even if someone is being an ass, you could keep your calm and come back at them with something that would leave everyone else liking you even more. Someone not to mess with, but as long as interacted with in a mutually respectful way, aka any decent human being, you'd get along great. Anything else, no idea, but when it comes to social life, you're beautiful, you'll know your way around, and you can achieve any type of closest circle you want.
Wow goals 😍 11/10
20/10 you're way more feminine then an average cis woman.
9.5 outta 10! It ain’t perfect (I haven’t seen anyone perfect) but it’s *quite* close!

Correct. Physically I'm unchanged. It's all clothing hair and make up so far.
I looked at her other post, and she seems like she only started HRT fairly recently
Thank you! 😘
Omg you're too kind!
Thank you!
You have a very natural beauty 

Use it to your benefit,,XO
I don't know who that is.
Same as my score. 10 would be (insert name of very feminine celebrity as I'm uncultured).

In other words, hell yes you pass and you're pretty too!
Awww thanks
Thank you!
Awww thank you! I take care of my hair
What number is fem. I can't find it on my calculator. Lol.
You're too kind

Thanks!
Thanks!
Thanks! 😘
Aww thanks
Thank you
Awwww thanks
Well thank you
Eww, creepy
Just honest.
Oh dang, you're already gorgeous. If you do decide to do hrt you'll unlock a superpower or something
Holy crap! If you hadn't said anything I wouldn't have even considered that. You're freaking gorgeous, no joke

You don't want to

Just got my first proper clothes today and put this outfit together. What do you guys think (MtF)		"really beautiful🌸
I wonder do all of us trans girls have a fascination, when first out, with denim jackets?
I like it. Very nice outfit
Outfit is nice, but I love your hair!  Looking good, girl!
Nice casual look.  Enjoy your new stuff!  ❤️
Cute, especially the skirt
Btw love the outfit
Loving the jacket! It suits you so well!
Really nice, i struggle with sleeve length so im yet to find a long sleeve jacket or top 😁
*Too Cute*🌼
Beautiful! You have rly nice hair btw-
oh my gosh you are litterally gorgeous!!
You put very well put together :) Nice choices
Cute cute cute ❤️
Your Beautiful 😻
Very sweet outfit. Classic yet cute
V pretty
Your are beautiful and look awesome live proud
Looks great on you! :)
It works ,you look good 😊
I can tell you're going to really blossom. The outfit is good, but if I'm honest I don't think the skirt matches the jacket. I don't know if it's the colour combination or the style or both, but may I suggest perhaps opening the jacket and having maybe a white undershirt to bring it all together? Fab for your first attempt though.
Cute outfit, very university study room chic!
This is really super cute!!
Im proud
Very cute
Beautiful
<3 ayyy giid for u ay u look so pretty! (do a jean jacket);D
You look perfect for a fall date! Apple picking or a walk through the forest to see the colors?
You look great!
Cute, and you have lovely hair 😊
I think your hot ^_^
Cute
You look so cuteeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee
you look beautiful!! the outfit really suits you 💕
Cute!!!!! <3
Congrats!  Very pretty!
I love it! Classy and cute. :)
You look so cute 😍
It brings the best version of you onto the surface. ❤️
Totally gorgeous :) I love the subtle colour pairing! Really soft and beautiful!! Also I’m quite jealous of how well you’re pulling off the bangs~ they’re not for everyone but you look really cute
I'm pretty sure I have the exact same jacket, from longtallsally?
It would be cute if the jacket was open!
Not me... light sweatshirts are my obsession
You learn to embrace 3/4 sleeves 😏
Also tank tops
Im really shy about my arms 😅
I dont like my arms enough for tank tops lol
It can be hit or miss tbh, but I like how they feel enough to make it comfortable most of the time"	ij3h18	trans	1214	1.0	2020-08-30 00:29:10
Is it okay to wear boys clothes even if I fully transition as a girl?		"Of course! You can always be a trans tomboy or just like actually well fitting shirts with thicker than paper material. Also pockets.
[deleted]
Transwoman TomBoy Mechanic here, Yes you can and you can still pass with flying colors when you do.
Yes! You should be able to dress and act how you want to!
[deleted]
Absolutely. I still wear some of my pre-out hoodies and shoes! Wear whatever you want doll❤️
Absolutely! If it makes you feel any better I know a lot of cis women who do this, tomboys and more feminine women (styling is everything). For many reasons, comfort, a better fit, or just because they look good in it. Wear what feels right for you!
Wear whatever feels comfortable, you don't have to wear dresses or skirts to be cosidered a ""woman""😊
Wear what you like. and yes as others have said POCKETS! why girls don't get pockets is bey-fu\*\*\*\*-ond me.
Yes!
Yeah! Everyone wears whatever they want, so why can't you?
yes. clothes are literally pieces of fabric. they have no gender.
Yes
Gender expression doesn’t have to have anything to do with gender identity, just wear what’s comfortable and makes you feel good!
Of course. Wear what you want! I'd wear skirts if there were any I actually liked.
Of course it is lol, trans tomboys are the best
That’s totally ok! Clothes don’t have a gender, you wear what you want :D
Wear what makes you happy, it doesn't matter.
Wear what you like. and yes as others have said POCKETS! why girls don't get pockets is bey-fucking-ond me.
It's just clothes.
As people keep telling me, clothes have no gender so wear what you want!
Girls wear guy clothes all the time! Nothing wrong with it.
You can wear whatever you want. Clothes don’t matter. I’m trans masc but I like wearing skirts. Whatever you feel comfortable with wearing, wear it
yeah absolutely! I mostly wear men's clothes since there's a lot of rad avant-garde designers doing cool stuff with men's wear that can be super androgynous looking! explore yourself fashion-wise regardless of gender and have fun with it! :)
Sure…women do that all the time!
Yeah lol im a tomboy thats all i wear i dress girly here and there but im a tomboy
Remember, kids—while gender is something else, gender *norms* are socially constructed and vary dependent on the culture. Clothes have no gender inherently (they are, however, great for self expression)—so wear  whatever makes you comfortable!
That's what I plan to do. I'm definitely a tomboy and I love the butch look. Wear what you want, sis. Presentation doesn't equal identity.
I try to think of clothes without having a gender. There are no boys clothes and girls clothes, just different ways of identifying sizes. You can wear whatever you want as long as you feel comfortable and happy wearing it.
And always remember: gender expression and gender identity are two different things
YEAH ABSOLUTELY!!!
Yes, you may notice old clothes no longer fit tho, me and my gF had our hips widen slightly after a year or two. 
And before anyone says that it's fat or something, my gF is 5'5"" and 110lb, she started hrt young enough.
I’m transmasc and kept most of my fem clothes and still wear them sometimes! Some days just feel like a day to wear a skirt instead of pants
Yeah... i mean my wife wears my old shirts all the time lol
Yeah, of course, you can do whatever you want
Sure, do whatever you want! 🥰❤️
Clothing doesn't equate gender! Wear whatever you want!
Yah it's actually pretty common for women to wear men's clothes
Yes, of course.
of course, this is all about presenting in a way that makes you comfortable
plenty of women shop in the men’s section. it is completely fine, wear what you want.
Honey I'm like 5 years into this & pass daily & I still wear 95% gender neutral/masc clothes
Yep! Wear whatever you like, whenever you like.
yeah, there’s no such thing as boys or girls clothes. wear whatever you like
Yes, it is
You do realize you can do whatever you want right? Jeez😒 you’re a person not a stereotype
i have my closet of boy clothes that i’ve had for years so i’ve slowly been adapting it to work for feminine outfits. my ex gf used to take my shirts and wear them with her clothes all the time so i’ve been doing that and it’s been working. either a feminine top and masc bottoms or the other way around. still reads as feminine but like you’re wearing a boyfriend or somethings clothes
Of course! Clothes are clothes! You do you girl!
Yes. There is no boys or girls clothes. Theres just clothes. Wear whatever you want and be happy.
Yes, clothes are genderless, dont worry
..yes? i dont think anybody cares apart from people who believe all trans people only want to wear gender specific clothing. also thinking a gender has to wear specific clothes is the stupidest thing ever i stg
Pockets
Yes, pockets... Lol but i have several pairs of pants and shirts that im not getting rid of. A, practical clothing is what it is im not re buying and paying a premium for something i already have and B.  Just like early in the transition buying MY clothes, not boy clothes or girl clothes, Mine. XD
cloths are merely pieces of mostly tissue designed to protect and hide the weak flesh behind.

and by that I mean that if a specific piece of mostly tissue makes you feel better, go for it.
Short answer: Yes. 

Long answer: Yes, of course.
clothes have no gender lmao
It's okay to be *you*, no matter what that looks like!
Just wear whatever your comfortable in and whatever makes you happy
Yeah as long as your dysphoria allows for it, why wouldn't it be?
You can wear whatever makes you most happy and whatever you feel comfortable wearing
Is ur life do what u want
You’ll be a grown ass woman and can wear whatever t f u like
Only if it’s your boyfriend clothes ❤️🤷🏻‍♀️
yes it is, clothes are basically just put into gender boxes to make boring cishets feel comfy in their small bubble. What i am trying to say, clothing does not define your gender, its your brain
Everything that doesn't hurt anyone is okay 👍
Of course! See girls doing that all the time
Clothes don’t make gender!

A woman wearing boy’s clothes is still a woman.
Of course! I’m planning on at least trying to keep wearing men’s jeans. They have better pockets and more accurate measurements
It's whatever makes you happy! 😊
As I like to say, “they’re not GUY clothes, they’re MY clothes.”
If a girl can do it, you can do it!
Clothes are a social construct
Yes, cloth =/= gender
imo the golden rule is: do whatever you want, it's not illegal to wear the clothes you like or to present how you want to, and if anyone has a problem with it then they can go cope with it
I’m going to do the same, you can easily do it! Wear whatever you want
Girl you wear what you like when you like, there isn't any law saying you got to wear this or that, live life and be free from the chains of what others think xx
once you wear them, they're girls clothes. because you're a girl and they're your clothes
Nah sorry, state law says no... Of course it's okay hun
Of course it is. Clothes don’t define gender, they are just a form of expression. Wear what ever the hell you want, as long as those clothes make you comfortable and you like them, who cares if they are “boys clothes” or “girls clothes”. Clothes are what you make them and have no set gender to them, in my opinion. Women can wear masculine clothing, men can wear feminine clothing and it doesn’t make them any less of who they are.
i believe thats just being a tomboy, no different than any other girl
U B U
Lol pick a side.
Of course clothes are clothes! Wear what makes you comfortable ☺️
Do clothes define your gender? 

Didn't think so.

Go right ahead, there's no problem here.
This is literally my current style. I'm wearing jeans..boots a crop top, hoodie and beanie. I want to look more tomboyish in my regular clothes because it's more comfortable.
Why not? I’m a cis girl, feminine, but sometimes wear boy clothes just because I like them or are comfy. Wear what you like and find comfortable.
100% perfectly fine! Clothes don't have genders, it's only considered boy or girl by how society sees it. Make it so you see clothes as ""Every Gender clothes""! It really can make you feel better about wearing more 'masculine' clothing.
Personally I threw all of mine out but if you want to go for it

Edit: none of it was cute clothes, it was oversized sports clothes and stuff that didn’t fit me physically and as my personality, look boys clothes can look good but not when I use to dress like Adam Sandler everyday
Tom boy girls exist!
I had a cis woman friend tell me she would use her boyfriend's socks sometimes because she didn't have some on hand and they were barely different from her socks sometimes with the right style.
R/mtfbutch is living proof :)
Whatever you want to do is what's okay it's not like there are any rules about any of this
Yes. You do you.
Yeah lol im a tomboy thats all i wear i dress girly here and there but im a tomboy
Wear what makes you happy!
Yes. Butch, tomboy, and GNC women are valid, whether they’re cis or trans. And you won’t be the only one.
Girls are always allowed to wear boy clothes. It's when boys wear girl clothes that there is something wrong with them...or so I'm told.  Double standards are so much fun
Clothes are for everybody so just wear whatever makes you happy💕
Tomboys are cute asf
Yes, Girl. You can do everything!👑 Boys clothes won't kill us if we're comfortable with it.
Clothes don’t have gender!! I remember being conflicted about wearing one of my fav plaid jackets, thinking it looked too masc and that some ppl might not take my transition seriously if I wore it, but then I thought “do I look good in this jacket? Yea I do.”

If you like your clothes and think you look good in them, then that’s all that matters.
You should check out r/mtfbutch
Yeah definitely. Just as cis girls and cis boys can wear whatever and still be girls or boys, trans girls can wear men's clothes and still be girls, trans boys can still wear women's clothes and still be boys. As long as you feel comfortable, wear whatever you want :)
Yeah, of course, you can do whatever you want
Yeah, of course, you can do whatever you want
Only if you want the tranpolice coming and suiting you up in catgirl uniform.
Of course. How you dress and your gender identity are completely different things. You do you, however that is, because your clothing doesn't define you, only you do.

Hell yeah clothes definitely do not have a gender  wear whatever you want
Absolutely 
anybody can wear whatever clothes they want to be wearing
Ye it’s called butch or Tom boy
Ofc! Clothes don't have gender. Where what makes you feel comfy!
We all have some of our old clothes somewhere. T-shirts and stuff that I couldn't bare to get rid of
NO. Girls mustn't be allowed to wear Men's clothing, that would be an *abomination!*

/s /s /s /s......

Wait, someone reminded me about Pockets, so I prayed about it, and He has changed his mind; the updated Book will be released in another 1,988 years or so....
Yeah I'm still planning on wearing whatever I like lol
absolutely! clothes don't dictate your gender
I wear my boy clothes I just try to wear it in a feminine way
Clothes aren’t gendered.
Yes
yeah, wear what you wanna wear
I think it is! Wear whatever makes YOU happy
Sure, I don't see why not; it's just fabric
Trans tomboys are the best.
Yes!! Wear what you want
Sometimes you don't have a choice. I.e. financial situation etc. And thats ok! It doesn't change who you are as a person :)
I'm just gonna say this: clothes don't have a gender.
Yes, absolutely. Whatever floats your boat.
Of course! The only reason I don’t is because I’m kinda early on in transitioning so if I wore mens clothes I’d probably be clocked as male
That's the sort of thing that will get you arrested by the trans police. We are very committed to gender conformity, particularly when it comes to clothing! The trans police aren't that scary, though. Their handcuffs are the kind that have pink fringes.

Kidding!

Be who you want to be. Don't let anyone put you into a box--not because of the sex you were assigned at birth, not because of your actual gender. Be your beautiful self. The world needs you.
Not only can you but its fun and cool and cute to! Just be cozy with your body and dress for your mood!
You do you queen. Just do it proudly
Clothes don’t have a gender though… so why does it matter?
Not possible, all clothes worn by you are girls clothes
In this day and age, the rules of clothing are less stringent than in past eras. You should wear whatever makes you feel the most comfortable. If someone else doesn’t like it- who cares? You aren’t dressing for them, you are dressing for you.
Clothes shouldn’t be gendered. Also do whatever the fuck you want your, your own person. Girls can wear boy clothes if they want
non gendered clothing is like an integral part in being trans
Yes of course while I’m a trans male I’m also a femboy (haven’t fully transitioned yet since I’m not out yet) so with that logic of course
Yes
Sweetheart it's your prerogative on what you wear it's nobody's business it's nobody's concerned where would you want and be happy don't sweat the small stuff
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
Okay I've already commented earlier but I'm reading all these other comments and saying that we don't have to wear skirts and dresses to be women what the hell you mean I've been running around in these mini skirts and freaking having my ass slapped by freaking old old men for nothing I mean I could wear track pants okay I'm just pulling your chains everybody hugs to all the people that are in this Reddit conversation lol
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
Queen wear what ever the fuck you want B)
Of course, who defines their gender by their clothes?
It's okay for any girl to wear boys clothes
You. Can. Wear. Whatever. You. Want. 
I still wear mens socks because I got big feet.
Sometimes I'm lazy and I just do boy mode xD
Always! Clothes don't have a gender :)
There is no wrong way to dress when transition. I see no wrong in it. If that what makes you happy for for it.
I’ve thought about this too, I’ve still got a few T shirts that I love wearing (mainly the wolf ones) but I do still love being in skirts and dresses.
Clothes don't have gender :))
Clothes have no gender.
The more I transition, the less femme/more tomboy my clothing gets.
Gender is a social construct

Wear what makes you happy!
It is.
The other way around tho, not so much. It shouldn't be that way but it is.
Wear what the fork you enjoy wearing
They are all YOUR clothes.  Clothes don't have a gender.  Wear what makes you happy
As long as you feel good, wear whatever you want! Clothes are not restrictedny gender!
Yes
Well....yes....why not?
There are women wearing typically masculine clothes. Clothes are just clothes.
clothes are not gendered! don’t listen to anyone who says otherwise!!! wear what makes you comfy
Of course..this is all about what makes you feel good. You deserve to be Happy
Oh that’s cool to know. I mentioned that to my bf, he 100% supports whatever makes me happy. Yea I heard pockets is sometimes almost non existent in women’s clothes. Unless someone decided to make dresses or skirts with actually useful pockets
Pockets. Why are the pockets on womens clothing so much smaller? I got a pair of jeans which fit so much better than mens jeans btw but this was the first thing I noticed. I’m pre HRT
I mostly still wear men’s pants. I haven’t gotten a single pair Is women’s pants that fits quite right. Either the waist and hips are right and the legs are way too tight. Or the waist and hips are baggy and my legs are 4 inches shorter than whoever made the pants thinks they should be.
> or just like actually well fitting shirts with thicker than paper material.

I dug all my old boy flannels out of the donation box and put them back in the closet once I realized how thin women's flannel shirts are. We just had a blizzard here and I'm so glad I kept them.
Cheers! All clothes are gender neutral if we stop being bitchy about it.
i was going to reply something like this but thought ""surely someone else mentioned it before me"" kudos
If I got the guts, I would wear my leather jacket and leather leggings and leather boots. Really hate that I lack the courage to do so.
You nailed it the only person who opinion counts on the way we dress is our own nobody else's cuz we like to own that opinion! 😉
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
To think about it, seems like it’s A-okay and practical. Thank you for your input. 🙂
At least girls get to have purses, I tend to find myself carrying so many things. A nice bag, will be helpful.
Lol true.
I agree with you, thank you sweetie. 😊
True, but society has a different view. I sadden with that. At least I am making some small goals, starting with colors, patterned and more skin tight fitted clothes.
All thanks to society categorizing clothes. At the end of the day, it’s all just clothes. Now I start to see it all.
Thank you. I just lack the courage, but my mind say I want to wear whatever I want.
Need I say more?
Thank you for making me realize that.
I actually do have a BF, but he is bigger than me in size. I were to wear his tops, I would look like wearing a bag.
Yes, I believe. They are my clothes!
I understand, but I also lack the courage. Always been scared my whole life.
Haha, true. Once I wear em, they become girls clothes.
Ok, thank you hun.
That’s great, thank you for your comment. I have some pieces that I really like still, but they are all pretty universal and good quality.
lol
as a trans guy i have the same experience but reversed!!!
You can definitely find some with pockets but honestly they're rare and even a bit pricey. I actually am learning to sew just so I can make them or add them to clothes.
Torrid is one of my favorite shops because their clothes often actually fit and they have POCKETS!!!!
I discovered tennis skirts have great pockets that can fit almost as much stuff as cargo pants and also are hidden
I have thought of a solution to that. Take a shirt, and sew the sleeves shut. If you wear the shirt like a pair of pants you will kinda have a shirt skirt with pockets!
Purses. The entire industry is built around making women suffer and selling more stuff. It's terrible... even though it makes my ass look amazing
It's cause women's jeans are really tight and pockets would mess with the silhouette they create. Having stuff in the pockets makes it ten times worse. If it were a conspiracy to sell handbags, you'd see more bags being sold from companies that sell pants, so they could benefit from the problem they ""created""
The reason the pockets are so small it's just like Justin Trudeau said the reason we're not allowed to have our slim cigarettes is because it makes smoking more appealing to us women so the reason they don't have pockets or such small pockets because when they were first designed it was so that we could just slip our slim cigarettes in there okay I'm just yanking your chain I don't freaking know why
Huggz Becky 🇨🇦
I wish I know the answer. I’m pre everything, but had some efforts like trying clothes and wear makeup to work
To sell handbags I guess? Honestly wouldnt know...
Since I am still pre everything, I mainly wear skinny jeans or we’ll fitted pants to get me comfortable and use to more form fitting clothes. I have one pair of leather leggings but I’m too afraid to wear em out in public.
Omg yeah I kept all my flannels because they just don't make good ones for women or even at all it seems these days.
Do it!
Ohh that would go great with a motorcycle
I'm sure you'll finde the courage one day! Sometimes it takes a while until we can wear what we want and love and feel comfortable in it and that's okay! 
I have a friend that needed lots of reassurance to even just look for basic mens clothing (he's transmasc) and it took years for him to be confident wearing more stuff he likes and feels comfy in. And there's still stuff that he'd love to wear but just doesn't feel confident enough to do so. And that's okay. He'll get there, just like he did with the other stuff. And so will you with your leather jacket, leggins and boots!
I mean yes purses and clutches have their place but if I want to go for a or out dancing I don't want to have a bag with me, I have issues leaving bags unattended.
I would love that. Wear his smell
So was I, I hid away until I was in my early 50's my only regret in life was that I didn't do it sooner, and people of today really don't give a dam what other people are wearing, it's just our own self confidence that gets in our way, once we overcome that and don't give a dam what others think then our confidence grows quickly x
Wear em girl!!
That’s pretty neat. I do love to wear cardigans. So comfy and cozy.
Oh really, definitely gonna be on my shopping list.
I get that. Some times I wished I could carry a purse.. you can fit more stuff in it
Purses seem to be more solution than cause, if you ask me. It's not like the companies that make purses are the same ones that make clothes. I do think that women's clothing tends to be tighter, especially around the hips, and having a bunch of pockets doesn't necessarily add to the look. And if you're really committed to pockets it's not like there are no options.

Personally, I spent years wanting to carry a bag, because pockets often aren't enough, and worrying (sometimes with good reason) that people were going to make fun of me for wearing a purse. So now that I'm allowed to, you're damn right I'm going to carry a purse!
Except that most brands selling clothes without pockets aren't also making a lot of money from handbags and purses.
This is the real reason. Most brands selling clothes without pockets are not also selling handbags and clutches.
I wear boys clothes pretty much every day lol they're my work clothes. I don't mind messing them up too bad, and would rather keep my nice clothes nice. I always do makeup tho and wear more feminine styles, I'm so down with cargo pants lol. I don't think there's anything wrong as long as you're comfortable and dressed appropriately for the situation 🤔 😁
I’d guess it’s to sell handbags. They’re seriously overpriced… my mom has a handbag that’s literally just a fancy hydrophobic paper bag with some cloth lining, and that set her back a hundred dollars
Thank you sweetie, I totally will wear em.
Me too idk why but I can’t get used to a purse
That is true, handbags and purses are big money makers. Also are materialistic bragging rights. lol
you can buy cheaper handbags/purses D:

people just love to buy brands. This isn't really an exclusively female marketing thing. Some men do the same thing with sneakers (and the rest of their clothes tbh)

brand fashion is a thing. as a lifelong loser I have avoided such pressures 😌
Most brands selling clothes without pockets are not also selling handbags and clutches.
What I'm saying is that most clothes brands aren't making handbags, and vice versa. So the alleged motivation doesn't really exist."	slb1e8	trans	1177	0.98	2022-02-05 16:35:41
I wore a tie to school and this happened	"So a few days ago I wore a nice shirt and tie to school, and I was wearing a sports bra, so the closest thing I have to a binder, and I felt amazing and so pretty. I got compliments from even the annoying kids like they wanted to know what kind of knot I used(my dad tied it for me). 

And then the second I got home, my abusive mom like lost her shit. She pointed out that I 
‘have short hair and am wearing “guy clothes”’ and she kept questioning me about why I wanted to look like a boy and every single time I said I didn’t know because any other answer and I’d be dead. 

Then she told me that I need to start dressing like the pretty young lady I am and stop pretending I’m someone I’m not 

And that really hurt

But also at the same time I was so proud of myself like two hours ago my girlfriend was freaking out over my tie lmao and I felt so pretty. I’m not exactly trans(genderfluid) but I figured you guys had similar experiences and I needed to tell someone who got it

Edit: I feel I need to point out that like ten minutes after this happened my mother got into a fight with the Wendy’s waiter cause he ‘interrupted’ her lmao it was just her a Karen screaming YOU THINK IM SCARWD OF YOU?!?!? to this like twenty year old who was just trying to get our order"	"Do you live in one of the US or Canada, my dear?
Non binary, gender fluid, genderqueer, or just questioning, doesn't matter. You're welcomed in the transgender community and I'm glad you reaching out to others in response to your parent's behaviors. 

It's amazing how positive peoples acknowledgement of our identity can be empowering and sad how sometimes it takes just one person to push us back down. Stand back up and be seen. 

Regardless of your identity you can dress how you want and remember that you are an amazing person. Next time you wear the the tie you should take a picture of it with your girlfriend. Look back at it when your mom berates you. See how happy you are and know that bad weather passes. Be the spectacular ray of sunshine you are.

Glad your dad was helping you, I hope your mom doesn't convince him against teaching you to tie your own ties.
Clothes don't have a gender. They're clothes.
Ah, you made me remember this time in which I wore a male shirt for the first time, it felt so good, I put my father's tie when nobody was home and took a photo. I still have my long hair and all (pre-everything), but that was like my most masculine look so far, I was so happy <3
Hope you can get out of the thing with your mom, just keep being happy as yourself
Trans genderfluid here.

I'm so proud of you! Like seriously. Good for you! Now remember how good it felt to be seen, really SEEN and go there whenever you're mom or anyone else tries to tell you who you can/can't be. 

F your mom. She sounds crazy af. Ditch her a$$ asap. 

Find the little things that make you feel at home in your skin. But please above all, stay safe.
Parents live in a totally different world than we do. We spent a mere few hours at the end of the day with parents, but we spend the rest of the hours out in the world.

Parents have their own trauma. They went to school, in a different time, but they were bullies, or bullied, or witnessed bullying and felt helpless and coped however they could. Often this means conforming. Parents then take these life lessons and spread that karma (trauma) onto their kids. 

Your story is such a prime example of the two worlds. Your mom’s karma is not your responsibility. Sorry you had to go through this friend.
Screw abusive parents. They don't actually love you. They definitely don't deserve to be called family. Blood means nothing without kindness.

Sounds like high school, which means you're old enough to emancipate and move out. I wish i would have do so around age 7...
your mom sounds like such a karen lmao

you're killin it bro, and i bet you looked so handsome in that tie :)
with all due respect my dude, your mom is a bitch
Man she probably ruined the time for those Wendy’s people’s whole shift. I know that’s not the point. I hope you are able to get away from your mom. Are she and your dad still together?
If I may ask, does your dad support you? It sounds like he does since he tied your tie for you.
Sorry bout your mom dude. Maybe turn up the volume when betterhelp commercials are on? Sounds like she has some underlying issues to work out. Does she act like this when your dad is around?
You still belong and have a place in the trans community if you want it.

I'm sorry your mom sucks, I wish parents like that could see that *looking (subjectively) attractive to others* is FAR less important than *feeling good about yourself.* Besides, plenty of cis girls have short hair and wear ties AND they look great so she needs to get her head out of her ass. Also how ironic that you ""not pretending to be someone you're not"" is *exactly what pissed her off in the first place.*

I hope you're able to work something out, but if not I hope you're able to *be safe* until you get to a place where you can be yourself. I know it will be tough but it sounds like you have a cool girlfriend and we're always here to vent to and give advice if we can
your mom sounds insufferable, i can’t wait for you to move away from her and i don’t even know you
I didn’t know that ties were boy clothes…?
next time tell your mom should should stop pretending to be a good parent. after all  it's not good to pretend to be something you're not.
You quite literally stopped pretending to be someone you're not.

edit: also your mom seems a bit crazy.
Holy shit. What? Ties were pretty gender neutral the last time I checked???? Even by the standards of the 50s??? 

op, I think your mother was just wanting to start a fight with someone, and was looking for any reason to. If weren’t the tie, it would probably be something else.
Idk last I checked polyester, cotton and fabric material doesn’t have a gender
so sorry you had to deal with this. Your mom sounds like she needs significant professional help.
I'm genderfluid too. That's awesome that you got to wear a tie to school and annoying how your mother behaved
Coming from a gender fluid on the side of trying to be more fem I have experienced something similar with my father, he has been yelling at me about my nails after I got them done and telling me to cut them every time he sees me, even cursing towards me in a annoyed tone telling me to cut them and nearly harassing me about it

just try to stick through it, we believe in you, im sure you looked handsome with that tie and I’m happy for you that you at least have someone in your life that supports you, if you can try to call a hotline for finding help for getting out of your household situation if it’s too severe
sounds like a fun day besides the bad part! i bet you looked great!
I'm so proud of you, young sibling! Finding yourself is such a magical experience! Please know that you are loved, and there will always be a place in our community for you.

I'm sorry your mom acted so inappropriately. My mom also lost her shit on me when I started wearing more affirming clothes. Even though they were still from my agab section. Every situation is different, but she doesn't sound like a safe person to come out to. My relationship with my mom deteriorated rapidly after. It sounds like you have a little support network going though, and that'll be a big help. 

Oh also before I forget, tying ties was always stupidly difficult for me but there are a ton of videos on youtube with all different kinds of knots if you want to learn!
I’m sorry for what you are going through with your mom. I have one question though- waiter at Wendy’s? Do you sit down and they come to take your order?
Nice! Doing that in school for the first time is terrifying, but also feels amazing! Good job!
Your parents provide some things for you, your friends will provide love and acceptance.
I’m so sorry you have to live with your abusive mom. I had one too and it was awful. This year marks 10 years we haven’t spoken, best 10 years of my life.

Your dad sounds supportive, that’s great! Can you spend more time with him and less with your mom? Or are they still together?
I am not trans but like to wear ‘guy clothes’ you have a bad mom
The U.S. ✨
Awww omg thank you I’m so gonna take that pic with her yis I’m on the phone with her rn and she and I are freaking out over everyone commenting back
same
I would argue it a changes between people and only your opinion matters for your clothes. In OPs case ties are clearly quite gender and so they should continue to wear ties. I would recommend learning the schoolboy and the half Windsor knot. Eldredge and trinity knots are fun but can be too thick with most ties.
They do in our society though. Think of money for example. Does it have any value? It’s literally a piece of paper with ink on it but we as a society give the money its value. It’s the same with clothes. In an ideal world, they don’t have a gender but in our society it does
""gender is what's in your pants"" but then there are girls' and boys' clothing- so what my tshirts have vaginas now?? make it make sense
*cries in Hebrew*
Same
Now I'm remembering the first time I got a girl-cut T-shirt and how somehow it felt *physically* better to wear despite not fitting my body as well (pre everything)

It's crazy how the smallest most *insignificant seeming* things can somehow be so comforting, and yet still so terrifying for (shitty) parents to see
Awwww thanksssss omg
Dhisnsksjsja thank you so much bestie but yes I’m going to ditch her one day don’t worry
Oof yea you’re right still doesn’t give her an excuse to be an utter asshole to me for no reason I don’t point at her and say ew you’re wearing Karen boots even tho I do in my head lmao
Don’t worry I have three years until I’m old enough to move. I’m gonna make it don’t worry I have things like my friends(and gf) and my puppy and deltarune and music keeping me going

But yes screw abusive parents god
Oh dude I did and you should have seen it
Nah she doesn’t deserve respect she is a bitch
Dude fr the manager came up and was like lady why u being so mean and yea they still are even tho they hate each other lmao
Um idrk he’s still super toxic but he is nowhere near as bad as my mom BUT yes I agree it was so cool of him to tie my tie
Lmao maybe I should and no she’s a saint around him
Awwwwww yis yis yis yes I do have a cool gf and thanks serious me and her are crying over all this rn
Dude you have no idea like erggggg me too
don't you know? as soon as you put a tie on you automatically gain a penis
At schools with a school uniform, for some dumb reason they often have it where the boys have to wear ties, and the girls aren't allowed to. That's probably what OP means.
I live in southern America so very traditional here
OHHHHHH GOT EMMM
Oh damn I didn’t think about that saving ur comment 

And you’re not wrong
You’re most likely correct lmao
Fr dude
She does honestly god she’s horrible
THANKS BESTIE OMG
Thanks dude I really appreciate it. I hope we both get out of our situations and I bet you looked SO cute with your nails done.
I did!! Thanks bestie!! It actually was pretty great!!
Awww thanks dude!! I watched a video on how to tie ties so now I’m fluent in tie
I meant like the guy at the window lmao
Thanks bestie!!
True
Yea they’re still together unfortunately, they fight all the time, and no he’s not supportive. I was surprised he let me wear a tie to begin with. They’re both pretty toxic but you know it’s fine I’m surviving 

And I’m so happy for you like fr
Yeah I do lol
Lovely, I'd reccommend (if you have access to a phone) calling Trans Lifeline. Their website is translifeline.org and you can call on (877) 565-8860.
I've heard of them doing some good stuff but I am english so I don't have any personal experience with them. Hope you can feel better about it soon, dude! X
Same here, I'm m2f trans, and I hate it here. I haven't had an experience like that just yet, but my heart goes out to you! My mother just pretends that I never told her that I'm trans.
And the Trevor Project! A great place to talk if you ever need it 💖
Made me lol, have an upvote
Ooh thx dude will try them out (and also thanks again lol)
Money is a necessary construct for now. Gender is quickly being shown to be an outdated way of boxing people in. Gender is quickly shifting to become a ""use if it makes you feel better"" kind of construct.

Tl;dr money is necessary, gender is not
IF GENDER IS WHATS IN YOUR PANTS THEN MY PRONOUNS ARE YOUR/MOM
I love your name btw
Like literally fr like when I’m wearing a sports bra and shirt and hoodie and I look just that *little* bit slimmer up there it like makes my day
She doesn’t have a right to spread her trauma to you like that at all. Lol Karen boots 🤣
That sucks, I hope you can get away from your toxic parents and live your best self.
Oh so it's an imbalance of power kind of thing it sounds like. Your dad sounds cool though, would recommend chipping away at your mom's stepford wife issues when he's around if possible.
My school’s uniform has everyone wear ties
Thanks dude, I appreciate that :)
Ah im sorry to hear your dad’s not supportive. I assumed a lot from hearing he helped you tie a tie. My mom let me wear a tie to school in 7th grade too but she wasnt accepting of me being bi even, let alone non-binary. 

How much longer do you have to live with them? Even if you don’t want to go no contact like I did, living away from them can really help.
Omg thanks so much
Ugh parents just need to go away unless someone has supportive parents. Then that’s great for them I’m rly happy but why do parents just have to suck
Okay thanks!!
That was just an example. Same thing applies for diamonds as well. They can be manufactured in labs for very cheap prices but are being sold for thousands of dollars. Why? Because in the 1900s if I recall correctly a few companies created a false sense of necessity and now there is a huge market for it.

These are just examples they can be applied to pretty much everything. If you spend the majority of your time looking at things from an optimistic point if view, you’ll overlook the pessimism in our society. Things are quickly changing in our society yes that’s true but there is a very large portion of conservative bigots in our society as well and since most politicians are old fucks, they also share the same beliefs and thus why we are still unrepresented by the law in most places
Stealing this foreverrrr
YES
Thanks dude me too
Hate to get your hopes up but my dad kinda sucks too I don’t have anything specific that can explain this better but he’s toxic too his thing is making me clean the house all day(regretfully I am homeschooled, I just take classes at a church ikr still can’t believe I wore a tie there :DD) and the very first thing he says to me when he gets home is ‘why is the house so filthy’ and then threatens to take away my electronics although my mother has already taken them away for the week days because ‘my grades are suffering’ EVEN THO I HAVE ALL A’S EXCEPT FOR SCIENCE SO ITS NOT LIKE HES DOING ANYTHING yea my life is hard lmao
I’ve got two and a half more years until I can move out, but I’m not going no contact until I’m self sufficient. Don’t worry I’ve got it all planned out lol
My pleasure, hun! X
I hope it does well for you!
I see what you mean now; thanks for explaining!
Lmao
I’m glad you have a plan! 

You might’ve already taken care of this, but one thing I wish someone had told me is to get a bank account with only my own name on it ASAP. most banks will require an adult co signer for minors, but some don’t.  My parents emptied my account of $1200 I earned from my job the week I moved out, back when that was two months rent. I got a Bank of America account in my own name only after that so they couldn’t take any more.  BofA sucks but they did give me an account when I needed it and didn’t require a co signer (I moved out before I turned 18)
Oh wait that’s actually really good to know thanks all my money is in my dads account and it’s a good amount so I’ll be sure to think about that and god I hate your parents 

And bofa lmao
Move that money as soon as you can!!! While avoiding arousing suspicions of course. God I don’t miss living like that. Torture."	r18aup	trans	1169	0.99	2021-11-24 15:55:06

I don't think I've ever blushed as hard as I have reading your response! Thank you!
I've been caught! Heheh it is! I love it!
Thank you! To be fair, I woke her up from a nap begging her to take it, so I can't complain lol
Thank you!
Thank you! Those are my favorite pieces of the outfit!
Thank you!
Someone from the reddit linked it to me. It's on Amazon! I can link it to you in dm's if you'd like
Thanks so much! Truth be told, its a wig. My hair was wet because I just got out of the shower when I took the picture
Thanks so much! I'll link where I got the shoes if you'd like!
Thank you so much!
I got it on amazon! I can link you in private chat if you'd like!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
They are! I absolutely love them!
Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Thank you!
I got everything but the blouse from amazon. The blouse was a gift from someone
heheh, I got it on Amazon. I can link you if you'd like
heheh, it's a very small one XD
I personally like the contrast, it really makes the outfit pop.
Did I make a bad fashion choice? I'm not really the best at fashion
Awe thank you! Though I am far from looking like a princess yet
Thank you!
Thank you!
Thank you!
Of course! I can link you to almost everything in private message if you'd like
thank you! I can link you to the bag if you'd like
Where did you buy that bag?? It's so cute.
Totally welcome cutie! I meant every word
You are a beauty from up to down baby keep shining
Haha I love that series I was reading the manga when I was actually a teen <3 somehow it came into my mind 😅
Yes pleaseeee I've been searching for that exact skirt I found it once but it was for skinny people, I even have thigh highs to match matches have the white stripes too
[deleted]
Thank you!!
Ty :>
could I also get a link pls?
Plsssss me too
I was wondering because sometimes plasticy material can be quite hard. Do you remember where you got them?
nooo why amazon, shipping always cost so much, i saw a really cute sweater on there for 30$, when i checked its another 40 just to ship it here, it just cost way too much. South African online stores never have as much cool stuff as amazon, i just cant win xD
You did a great job, and the shoes are to die for, but I have found that a light colored shoe on black stockings or leggings makes me look short. As an overall look, dark shoes or boots would look better. Pull the pink out this summer with a white dress or shorts..
Hmm at least you shoes do match with your accessories
That would be awesome!!
yes please !!
Thank you! I really appreciate the kind words!
I used to always watch the anime and wish I could be a cute card captor girl myself
Thanks! ^^
Sure! I'll send it in a dm!
I got them from Amazon
Oof, I'm so sorry
I can't private chat you >.<
Cardcaptor Sakura is probably the earliest 'sign' I was trans haha. I didn't think I would see other trans girls with a history with that show. There are _dozens_ of us!
Noo its ok thx, sure its anoying but ill live, i dont have a job rn so shopping will have to be put on hold anyway, im just waiting for my hrt money, if im lucky and have exstra im buying myself a whole new wardrobe >:D
I think I fixed it, you should be able to now!
It's definitely a good sign when you watch the show and want to dress up like Sakura XD"	11qu2yh	trans	1160	0.97	2023-03-14 02:30:23

But that’s really nice of you to say. :)
Ya, these small victories are what I look forward to.  One day I can live like this full time
That’s so nice of you 🤗
Well physically you are more than ready it seems. If I passed you in the street I’d only think how pretty you are. But yeah I get mentally it can be challenging. Neighbourhood was my largest barrier and I’ve only recently overcome that after years of wearing what I want out to the shops. 

But when you feel ready, you will be ready and the world will be a more beautiful place for it."	reemun	trans	1082	0.99	2021-12-12 02:12:51
is it right to call myself trans?	"👋 well the deal is I was born a dude, but for like a week I've strongly wished I had the body of a girl, and I feel like one too. recently my friend jokingly called me ""she"" and I really liked it, I've really been wanting to try girls clothes as well. but the thing is, while I would really like having a female body, I'm fine with my male body too, and can't see myself getting reassignment surgery (maybe cause I'm poor as fuck? maybe not, idk). so is it really okay to say I'm trans? is it not disrespectful to the community? how do I know my mind isn't playing tricks on me? sorry if this sounds like a huge mess lmao, can't really ask anyone I know irl cause I live in a bad part of the world

thanks a lot in advance"	"You are at a tipping point. You recognise something that your were, and potentially something that you are. Maybe you are trans, maybe non-binary, maybe just questioning. There is no right or wrong, just ensure that you love yourself as you journey on your path of self discovery. I am a full time trans women living her life, although non-op. This doesn’t make me any less or more of a trans woman than the next. Find your best self. Love & hugs.
*sounds of egg cracking*
You absolutely can call yourself a trans woman! You don't need to hate your body or undergo medical transition to still be trans. If you want to be a girl, then you probably are. Welcome aboard, Miss!
yes!! you don’t have to have dysphoria to be trans!! sometimes i marvel at the damage people like kalvin garrah can do to the community.
Hey there! Throughout self discovery, we feel a lot of different things all at once, and at different times through the journey. 

The fact that you're questioning this and asking means that you are likely some type of trans! From reading your post You could be any number of gender identities. Just try things out, talk to people, figuring out how you feel first, then try to put a label on it, if you want to. No pressure! 

Feel free to DM me if you wanna chat!
I think it's time to head over to [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)

But a few more things. First there are no hard and fast rules on being trans (i.e. you must get X procedure or you can't think Y) being trans just means you no longer fully identify with AGAB (assigned gender at birth) how you DO trans is completely up to you. Second you mention you're fine with your male body. That's a common thing for people newly discovering themselves. Sometimes it persists often people realize just how much much they don't like the body but have always been conditioned to accept it. Best I can say is don't make any firm decisions. Keep yourself free to explore.
These are the first steps. As you journey further into discovering yourself, your going to see memories in a new light and likely learn that this has always been there, just repressed. 

Cis people dont think these things, there's not much that can be done to confirm anything, but just trust yourself, you've gotten yourself this far.
If that's how you feel then yeah I'll call yourself trans. There is no issue with that. And there's no wrong way to be trans so whatever that experience is like for you and if it's a label that you like then yeah call yourself trans
This is exactly how I started out. I also felt like the change wouldn't get a positive reception. Ever since I came out a few weeks ago everything has felt fantastic. Changed my name and everything. I never felt dysphoria as a man before I came out, but now that I am presenting like a woman, I have never felt more like myself. Contrary to the username, my name is Juniper now. Feel free to ask anything  :)
Anyone who experiences gender differently than a cis person is trans, it's an umbrella term. So welcome to the club!


Agender Queer here
Just make sure you’re taking time to think about what you want and why. If you’ve only been feeling this for a week you may want to take some time to let the feelings settle in while doing some introspection. Don’t be afraid to take time to try things before you label yourself. Keep in mind, you can call yourself whatever you want, but I’d advise against telling a lot of people in your life that you ARE trans as if you end up realizing that that’s not the label for you, it could lead people to doubt you identity in the future.(that’s just my opinion btw) Telling people you trust you are exploring with gender and are trying the label of trans woman can be a very helpful way to figure things out while also not sealing you into a label. 

This is just my personal view, a week to me just seems very quick to label yourself. Good luck and stay safe on your journey!
At the risk of getting hate: labeling yourself  “trans” after wishing you had a different body for a week is kind of jumping the gun. You really don’t have to label yourself anything right now. If you dress in something pretty, and people ask if you are trans , you could just say “I’m being myself”. If you have the freedom to do so, go buy some clothing at a thrift store. Barrow a friends lipstick and blush. I was a lot like you, but did end up transitioning in middle age. I slowly began dressing the way I wanted, working up to the most feminine styles over a period of a few years. (I don’t pass right now, up close) I choose a different name, began a cosmetic routine of NEVER having beard shadow, and finally got hormones, things felt good, and I felt better as a non passing trans woman than I did a regular guy. It felt natural to me. I began calling myself transgender after I was sure this was the course I wanted to be on, for the rest of my life, and I came out to my family. Wishing you the best!
R
it's okay I'll make one for you
Yes, you can be trans without feeling dysphoria or hating your body :) Welcome to the trans community, hun <3
You have the soul of a girl so you’re a girl. That’s all there is to it.
Sure! go ahead! and if later you figure out that trans isn't the right label for you then call yourself something else! labels are not set in stone, you can change them if you find something that suits you better! labels are not pie, you having some doesn't mean others get less <2
It’s only been a week. Maybe think about this more- I questioned for 6 whole months before I even thought about coming out!
you can call yourself trans for a while to see how it feels, i was afraid to call myself trans as well when i knew i would rather be in the body of a man but i wasnt feeling too awful abt being the way i am as well. i started calling myself trans recently, transmasculine and a trans man as well, and these labels seem to fit well one day but not as much another. it's a fluid thing, identity. so you can absolutely try to see how it feels for a while and however you come out of it whether as cis or trans or something else, it wont be disrespectful to the community.
Just... try stuff out. Labels are a personal thing we leverage to better express how we feel about our identity. Besides saying you're a trans woman, you could just go with questioning or nonbinary or genderfluid etc. *if that makes you more comfortable*. If being she/her is most comfortable then roll with it! There's no mandate that once you begin to identify with another gender that you're in some mythical lockdown where it's inevitable you'll have to get bottom surgery. Then again, my fickle ass could use some external pressure to continue towards being more authentically myself.
Maybe you could be nonbinary femme
you sound like baby trans

Just focus on yourself and try not to have really hot takes on Twitter until you've had a bit longer to figure things out ok?
Maybe, maybe not. Perhaps you're also just nonbinary. Only you can say for sure but it might take you some time to figure out.
""Transgender"" just means you don't identify as the gender asigned at birth.

You say you don't fully identify with your assigned gender. So... by definition... you're trans. 

Now, if you eventually decide that you DO identify with it, then you're be cis again. But for now... welcome. Any specific questions you need answering?

Also, remember that ""trans"" doesn't mean that you need to ""switch sides"". Look into non-binary, gender-fluid, agender, etc. 

Finally... whatever you do... do if tor YOU. Become the person that makes you happy.

See you later, sis(?)
Sounds trans to me, love. You don't need dysphoria of any kind to be trans, so the fact that you aren't bothered by your current body is irrelevant. The question is if you identify as anything other than what you were assigned at birth. If you'd be happier as a woman, you're probably a woman.
Trust me, the thing that you *want* to be is almost certainly what you actually are. I spent way too much time thinking I couldn't possibly be genderless, no matter how nice that sounded, because clearly I was still some amount ""girl"". I was wrong, I am agender/gender-neutral/genderless. No girlness here.
Something I’ve heard a lot and resonated with is “it’s not about the Dysphoria, it’s about the euphoria” you don’t have to dislike your body as male to still feel better as female :) 
You could also consider yourself to be non-binary transfem too or a related term too, which just means you transition to fem but in a way that might not match the binary associated with being a woman 
I hope this helps, and I’d say that yes, if you feel comfy using the label trans, use it ❤️
This is something that will be completely up to you. There is no right or wrong way to be trans. 

While the popular narrative of trans-ness is of trans people knowing from a young age, and always having severe dysphoria, that is not a universal experience. 

I have found that a much more reliable indicator of a person being trans is gender euphoria. It sounds like you're getting pieces of that with how people are addressing you recently. I would suggest exploring that further. 

What closed the door on me being able to stay in denial is imagining myself in old age, and in death. The idea of living as an old man and being honored an remembered as one was abhorrent. 

I'm 3 years into knowing myself as a trans woman. I am taking baby steps in transitioning; I've been on hormones for a few months. If you decide that you are trans, there is no mandated timeline for changing your life. Do things at the pace that is most comfortable for you.
egg
Practically þe same deal as me, girl.  Welcome
👍👍 thank you!
Ofc, if you wan't to identify as one. You don't need dysphoria or surgery to be valid. (also clothes dont define your gender so please wear whatever you want.
You could always be non-binary. Just throwing thoughts out there.
The First Rule Of Trans is . . . . . 

“Please pick up all the bits of shattered shell from your cracked egg before you leave the room.” 

🤗🤗🤗

If you’re a sister, you’re a sister. You could also be a nibling.
Identifying as trans despite not being sure or not wanting to medically transition at all or all the way is not hurting the trans community despite what some people say.
sounds pretty trans to me
sister you are just beginning to crack your egg welcome to the community you can call yourself trans any day
you can call yourself whatever you want, yeah!

i feel exactly like you but only on certain days, so i call myself gender fluid
I'm genderfluid :)

I like both my masculinity and femininity
If you’re not sure, you can always start with genderfluid. That way, you can swap based on how you feel that day. If you eventually favor a gender more than another, then you’re free to commit.
r/egg_irl
I am new to the community both irl and online. Sure I had friends, but I never questioned myself.

Being that unfamiliar, I do make mistakes in terminology and in instances I had never come across before. (I readily apologize if I do and do my best not to, rather say nothing than the wrong thing)

But I have come to the conclusion that yes, you can, but you might also realize you're somewhere in between down the line. I question my authenticity daily.

Where you ultimately land is your own journey.

But people are pretty understanding that this is quite a change. It's going to be confusing.

(I guess it's worth clarifying, people are pretty understanding IN the community, outside... Nsm)

I wish you luck in finding out who you are and whatever you end up being, be a good one. 🖤
Girl (if you're OK with being referred to as such), you are probably trans

Being trans is not (only) about suffering, it's about being happy as your true self. There is no right way to be trans. You are just you, and you can call yourself whatever you feel comfortable with
You do not have to have or want surgery to be trans, you  are valid
Could be that you don't have gender dysphoria but have euphoria. Maybe look into that? You can definitely be trans without dysphoria and identifying as trans only to change your view later is totally okay. Explore these thoughts, try out those clothes and social stuff that you want to try out, in a safe environment of course since transphobes do exist and some methods of binding and tucking are not physically safe, such as tapes, just stay away from tapes if you choose to bind or tuck. Keep safe, explore yourself, your own mind, and see what comes up. If you find comfort in labels go ahead and explore them, there's a lot more in there than just trans woman or non binary, but if you are the type to not care for labels feel free to not label yourself in anyway whatsoever. After all, labels are a tool for finding community, you don't have to use it.
u can call yourself what makes u most comfortable. and u dont have to want/have surgery to be trans. take your time with it (it was very confusing for me at first) and good luck :)
just like many important things in life, gender identity isn't just black and white. Not even ""being trans"" is just black and white. There are so many different ways different people feel about their gender identity, and if you get two trans men for instance, both of them may tell you very different things about their gender identity. 

I myself am genderfluid, and I sometimes wish I were in a female body, I'm never repulsed by the idea, but I'm sometimes repulsed by my male body, and sometimes I'm fine with it. I call myself trans, even if I'm sometimes boymoding.
There is no requirement to be trans other than having a gender identity which differs from your assigned sex at birth.

Medical transition, or the desire for it, is not a requirement.

You’re the only person who can say you’re trans - and if you say you are, then you are.
If you feel like the label “trans” fits you, go for it! It won’t hurt anyone, and besides, labels can change, so if you feel like it doesn’t fit you later down the road that’s perfectly ok! Trans is an umbrella term for a reason! 😊
Yes sis
 You dont need to do anything call yourself trans :)
Exploring different genders is totally welcome! You might dip your toes and try out whatever you want. You might even end up realizing you're cis but GNC (gender non-conforming). And remember, labels are made to work for you, not the other way around: they explain who you are, but do not define you.
Yeah, sounds a lot like stuff people say as they figure out their identity. It’s perfectly reasonable to call yourself trans if you feel the label fits ❤️
You’re trans, fam
Hi! This happend to me. I recommend reading tons of papers. Not every transition is medical, there's social transition which does not make you any less trans <3 Within the trans community there's tons of 'branches' I guess. And with time, what you identify with will become rock solid and you'll know where you stand on the spectrum.   


I recommend a sort of quiz, i think it's called dysphoria bible, to help understand youself.
Yeah of course no matter who you end up being it's okay to change labels and test things out. ♡
Please do not be afraid of trying things out ! You can most definitely call yourself trans, I don't see why anyone would mind. Gotta say tho, those are not very cis thoughts you are having ;3 Also, trying to say who is or isn't trans based on how much suffering they go through (hear disphoria, harassment and the like) is not the way to go. It's okay if you don't mind your body at all, or much. My disphoria varies on a day to day basis, and has shifted focus over time. I'm not less trans when I'm not crying over my chest, and I'm not less trans because I do not wish to take hormones at the time ;3 Just as you not feeling disphoric doesn't mean you are not allowed to do things that feel nice (like trying out pronouns or other styles of clothes). Good luck on your path to self discovery ! If you want to try out pronouns and name ideas you can try and see if r/transtryouts would be good for you <3 Even if you were to discover later on that you were not trans, it's okay. Anything that helps you know yourself better is a good experience. Maybe you'll find that you're a cis person that likes presenting feminine, and that'd be fine. Sending you love <3
You’re a lot like me
That's how I was before I really realized. I played around and tried gender fluidity for a while as well. It's okay to play around with your identity and anyone who is not cis, at least in my opinion, has the right to identify with the trans community.
if you feel that you are transgender, then by all means you can call yourself that. nobody can tell you how you feel.

with surgeries and the like, not all trans people medically transition, whether its at all or certain parts. personally, im on T, i really want top surgery, and im currently unsure whether ill get bottom surgery, and im just letting myself go with the flow.

it might take a while to find a label that you are comfortable with, and i think a lot of people would encourage trying out different things and labels before settling on trans. not saying that you're not, again, only you know that, but it doesnt hurt to try things out, and it can help identify any unclear feelings you may be having.

i wish you luck with wherever life takes you and with whatever you decide to do!
Huh, sounds like me last week
Welcome aboard, pretty lady!
I was exactly right here a few months ago and decided to just go for it, it was amazing and I absolutely loved it! I know this isn’t the solution for everyone, my advice would be just trying things out more and see what you think before making any big decisions
Hahaha, this just happened to me not long ago. I’d always struggled with dysphoria and leaned towards gender-neutral/masculine labels and outward expressions, I just didn’t have the right words to describe it. I didn’t know why I was always so worried about my appearance, I had long hair, always wore makeup, have a really feminine body, and I could recognize when I looked good, but something always just felt a little off, and it was uncomfortable. I’d been using she/they and then they/she pronouns up til recently, had a huge wave of dysphoria that flared up every time I had my hair down, did anything feminine with my appearance, or was labeled with feminine terms; couldn’t take it anymore and cut my hair and started going by they/them. It’s still really odd to me how my brain just forced me into realizing that I’m nonbinary (and maybe transmasc), but my transition over these last couple months has felt so natural and the gender euphoria is wonderful. I’m in college and all my friends respect my gender identity and pronouns, so it’s literally the most comfortable I’ve ever felt in my own skin.

I hope you can find that same support and community wherever you are! Experimenting with your gender presentation and even coming out to people around you doesn’t mean you have to use those identities forever, if you do and then realize you feel better with a different identity, you hurt no one by changing it. Being trans is so wildly cool and unique, so embrace the opportunity to fuck with society’s gender boxes!
I think you’re trans if you’re not cis. And if you realize later you weren’t really trans, no harm done—it’s ok to experiment with labels.
There's no right or wrong way to be trans. Being Trans is a very personal and intimate self identity. Whether you choose to medically transition or not, you can identify as trans! My fiancée is non-binary and doesn't have any interest in HRT or bottom surgery but that doesn't mean they're any less transition than me, someone who wants all the surgeries haha. Hope this helps!
You can call yourself anything you want! Just experiment, try clothes, pronouns, everything will become clear.
Hmmm 🤔
Your gender is fluiding. On my gender journey, I’ve found that there are periods where I’ll go from knowing and being confident to not fully knowing. It’s completely normal, you’re just new to it. You’ll figure yourself out in due time. You can call yourself trans if/when that feels right.
Yeah, that sounds to me like you could be trans. It's okay if you want to call yourself trans! 🖤
My experience was almost exactly like yours. ""I don't _hate_ being a guy, so I doubt I'm actually a woman.""

> _""She was, in fact, actually a woman.""_

Everyone's experience is different, but do what you will with that info. Some of us don't realize we're experiencing dysphoria until we get our first couple tastes of *euphoria*.
Sounds like you may be trans, you don’t need reassignment surgery to be trans though, not all trans women have surgery
You don’t need to put a name on it but in my experience if you call yourself trans and that you are you’ll feel something big in you not wanting you to go backward
You should just explore and try things out! You don’t have to dislike being male in order to want to be female. You don’t need to have dysphoria to be trans. You also don’t have to want srs to be trans. The desire to be trans is all you need to be trans.

There’s also many different nonbinary identities under the trans umbrella that you might find that you fit into better, like agender, gender fluid, bigender, demiboy/demigirl, and more.
Well there's an ocean of gender identities between ""male"" and ""female""; you can be both (bigender), neither (agender), shifting between multiple genders (genderfluid), shifting in intensity of gender identity but not changing the gender (genderflux), shifting between multiple genders AND intensity of identity (fluidflux), being primarily genderless but periodically identify with various genders (agenderflux), having some aspects of gender identity remain constant while others fluctuate in intensity (demigender), having multiple gender identities that each fluctuate in terms of intensity (multiflux), having a strong gender identity that is neither male nor female (nonbinary, xenogender, maverique, etc.)...there's more but I'm getting lazy, lol. Any/all of these can be under the trans umbrella! But there's also ""isogender"" which is neither cis nor trans.

Regardless of what feels right to you in the moment, you're totally good to update your declared gender identity as often as you like as you gain a deeper understanding of yourself! Or you can just identify as ""questioning"" until you find something that resonates enough to where you feel confident in declaring it! With the exception of truscum, the trans community is suuuper welcoming and no one's gonna get mad at you for trying out different ways of identifying yourself. Be free, and find your truth!
👋 Genderfluid here, former self-identified FTM transman, experience with hormone therapy. Doesn't matter. What does is that we're all trans, all of us who identify as something that isn't exactly what is on our original birth certificates, and who want to be proud of it. 

For me, my saving grace was realizing that Genderfluidity is real! It's a non-binary trans label and it took me years of misery to finally accept that I'm not exactly a man or woman. But I'm still trans! I still identify as a woman at times, I have a whole relationship and different settings where I identify as either female or as not having gender, where I present highly feminine, and I'm still trans. 

I've been a man, a woman, no gender, a blend of two or more genders, a third gender, with men, ENBY folks and women in relationships, and it's all valid and all me and I'm so happy and proud to consider myself trans and have my trans sisters, siblings and brothers support. 💙💗🤍💗💙 🏳️‍⚧️⚧️ 💙🖤💜🤍💗
I would recommend the dysphoria bible https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Realizing how many times I’ve said “I’m not trans tho
It depends what you want to call yourself. If you think you are trans, then you probably are.

When i was as far along as you, i didn’t consider myself trans yet, rather questioning, since i wasn’t sure. But i’m not going to say you have to go through the same cycle as me. You are the only one who can say anything about your identity, transbinary, cis or otherwise. The only way you can disrespect us with labels is if you either deliberately use the wrong labels on us, or if you knowingly use the wrong labels on yourself with the purpose to undermine the trans community (like the classic attack helicopter joke).

And you don’t have to get surgeries to be trans. Being trans is just recognizing your gender identity isn’t coresponding to the body you were born with, wether you decide to change your body to better fit your ideal is irrelevant to wether or not you *are* trans, it is just something to consider *if* you are trans.
Go ahead and try it out, maybe try saying you think you may be trans if you want to ease people (and yourself) into the whole thing. There’s no rush and there’s no shame in exploring yourself, if you find out you’re happier as a woman and you’re definitely trans, great! If you find out that isn’t exactly right, that’s great too. 

If there’s a “goal” to being trans, it’s to become the best, truest, happiest selves we can become. If you feel better, more yourself, and more happy as a woman, then yeah, you’re trans.
I think it is important to remember that surgeries and hormones do NOT ""make"" you trans. For example, someone could have been in the closet their entire lives, unable to socially, hormonally, or surgically transition, but does that mean they weren't trans? Of course not! Your mind makes you trans, and some people might only experience social dysphoria. This medical gatekeeping has been a plague in the trans community for the past few years and I always feel so terrible for our little trans eggs who are trying to question themselves throughout all the nonsense. I am so sorry; it is why it took me 25 years to realize I am trans.

And some advice would be to just try socially transitioning and see how it suits you! There is nothing wrong with discovering a specific identity doesn't fit you and then detransitioning or trying another. (This is another stigma I wish would be done away with.) Do you, and you will always have support from this group in wherever you end up. ❤
For me, I didn't really have dysphoria for the longest time, but It started to ramp up as time went on after realizing I was trans, so recognize that that could happen.

If you want to be a girl, congrats! You did it!
you’re probably trans

take your time and try and understand how you feel but this is usually the point at which you start to realize
Try different labels under the trans umbrella! There are tons of things! And you can use whatever feels right to you! Everyone is different and what you are feeling and experiencing is completely valid! So try things out! See how different labels feel, look up what different labels mean! And if none of them fit you, that’s okay too! Labels are simply there to help simplify things, but if you don’t find a label that fits you, don’t use one! No one says you have to! Find what works for you, everyone’s experience is different and feels different, whatever makes you comfortable and feel like you, makes you, you! Hope this helped! 😁💞 good luck on your path to discovery!
Yeah I'm the same girl, don't have dysphoria or feel negatively about my body as it is, and I spent way too long thinking I was intruding in trans spaces and didn't deserve hormones because I'm not trans.   
Yeah I was kinda dumb, still trans tho
you can be trans without dysphoria!
it’s so sad that this is such a common feeling for baby trans… i hate how divided the trans community can be, all this nbphobia and gate keeping n shit. like how does someone exploring their own gender in the way that feels natural/comfortable to them in any way invalidate someone else’s gender/experiences with gender??? literally remember thinking almost exactly the same as OP in my initial questioning. I was overly anxious about overstepping/invalidating anyone else, it was incredibly confining and stressful. finding yourself doesn’t have to be so anxiety inducing. do whatever makes you feel good, then in that process u find the label you feel best describes yourself, or you don’t! we don’t always need labels to define ourselves, although they may be helpful sometimes. i think in the beginning it’s more helpful to use labels as a guide, rather than a defining point to make about yourself
You don’t need to be uncomfortable with your body to be trans. All that matters is how you like expressing yourself.
If you feel more comfortable as a gender other than the one you had a birth, you’re trans. You have the right to self expression as long as you aren’t hurting anyone. I would ask for friends to use the new pronouns if you feel safe doing so. It helps to try it out for a while because socially transitioning doesn’t have any permanent effects on the body. If, sometime down the road, you feel differently about your gender identity and would prefer the pronouns you had originally, that’s okay too. The important thing is getting to know yourself better
I think you are bisexual transgender as you said you are comfortable with male body too and desire to have female body.
No, you don't have to have dysphoria or want surgeries or hormones to be trans. Just do what feels good to you my girl!
You don't need to change your name or get surgery to be transgender. So, if being called a girl and using She/Her makes you happy but, you keep your name and don't get surgery there is no shame!! All I can say is don't sign an agreement saying ""I'm a girl!"" and force yourself to stay that way if things change, Just let people you can trust know about you feel comfortable with using she/her and if it changes then it changes. You are finding out about yourself and it took me 4 gender identity labels to 100% be sure I was Demiboy. So it takes time, some find it out fast and some slower. But all you know is something is different and that's alright! little tip, not all trans people get surgery, it's about the identity and what makes you comfortable, not what is between your legs. Maybe later in life you find out surgery would make you super happy, maybe not. Just don't rush into things and keep an open mind about everything.
Well... Labels like trans are... Just that. Labels 
And, they're useful for helping us find one another and relate to one another, and just communicate who we are and how we feel. But we're all unique. So, just because the title doesn't perfectly fit, if it seems to be the most accurate one, and you use it honestly, then it's perfectly fine. One day, maybe you'll come across a different one that fits you better, and that's ok. 

Now, trans or not, I hope you're welcomed with open arms wherever you go on your journey of self discovery.
The biggest misconception about being trans is that you HAVE to have gender dysphoria.

In reality, some people never feel gender dysphoria about their agab, but do feel gender EUPHORIA towards another gender. They are just as valid as someone with gender dysphoria. Also, you are not obligated to dress as your gender or get surgery to be trans. Many trans girls dress as males because they don't feel comfortable being feminine in public. They're called boymoders

It's also possible you could be a demigirl or even some form genderqueer. For me, it took a lot of time and experience to realize I wasn't a trans girl, but I was nonbinary.

No matter who you decide you are, I wish you the best of luck and don't hesitate to reach out to me if you need any advice or even just someone to talk to. That goes for anyone who reads this too. My DMs are open ❤️
you right, we're all free to be what we feel like after all... thank you, I'll take a read to understand things more!
Girl it sounds like you're quite dysphoric.

Yeah, it's okay to call yourself trans, because you are
Have you done any drugs like mushrooms, lsd or any other consciousness expanding drugs in the last month? I have a theory about psychedelic induced gender dysphoria.
If that's how you feel like you can identify then go for it gender is a spectrum also it depends where ublive but I live in the UK and I can get any trans health care for frebut it's a long ass waiting list 
Ps. Hope this intro helps with the pronouns thing I can try she/they or they/them this is *incert prefered name here* she is new to the community so be nice to her
how should we tell them?
Oh hon.. i know how it feels. but please please PLEASE know that gender expression and gender identity are very different things, im a trans Male and will always feel more masculine, but i love dresses. it doesnt make me any less of a man and what your doing will not make you any less of a woman <3 hope this helps
You don't have to hate your body to be trans! I'm do tired of hearing this from everyone... gender dysphoria and self hatred are two totally different things. You could very well be trans and if that's the case, then 100% you can call yourself a trans woman. But until you're sure, it's totally fine to call yourself ""questioning"". Sit with yourself and think, find other trans creators and watch and learn from them, and see where it gets you! There is no rush in discovering yourself
OP, while I'm not the best to speak on the subject,  i want to applaud you for trying to be your true self.  No matter what ""form"" That is. I hope you have true peace and love in your life
very encouraging, thanks a bunch!
I love the use of “full-time” referring to being trans lmao. I’m a full-time trans person and a part-time educator.
are you making omelette cause I want some omelette if that's cool
gah damn, that made me feel warm!! thanks a lot!
well, kinda dumb of me to think that... btw who that is?
thank you very much!
omg our avatars are like siblings
Can vouch for this link, especially the pages with medical definitions. My therapist said it’s well written and the definitions are pretty accurate.
Seeing the ""Managed Dysphoria"" section really blew the eggshell off of me, I didn't even know that was a thing. I was able to check off like 90% of the examples listed in that section.
thank you! I will think some more tho, but I trust you are right,
you're very kind! thank you!
thank you 👍
no hate - I completely understand! to make it clearer, I'll still wait some more before deciding on a label. all the best to you too!
-P
I get the sense that I’m slightly more butch than you and if that’s the case, in order to fight the patriarchy I’ll have to do the cooking 😅

I’ll do my best to not leave in little bits of shell. My perpetual problem 🤦🏻‍♀️
thanks very much!
Probably the biggest turning point in my life was when I realized I had a woman's soul. 🥺 Now 8 years later my body and lifestyle match my soul as good as I can get it rn but I have such a better enjoyment of everyday because I know I'm not having to pretend I'm someone else that I was forced to be raised as. Stress is what leads everyone to early graves and I'm proud to say I'm way less stressed in my female life than I ever was as *him* 🥰
you probably right. tho Ima think about it some more, thanks for commenting tho!
thanks a lot!!
that's what I was kinda insecure about, thanks! another question if you don't mind, do the words ""trans man"" and ""transmasculine"" have different meanings?
thank you so much! all the best for you
certainly possible, thanks!
heh, nice to know! thanks
thank you!
I'm not too positive about that - but thank you for sharing tho! all the best
heh, nibling, haven't heard that before! thanks tho!
thanks very much!
Even if you eventually determine you're cis, after all, your going to be better for having asked the question and finding the answer, and know yourself better for having done it.
You don't have to get surgery to be trans... Look at me. I dont have it. What's between your legs doesn't make you one thing or the other. That's not what this is all about.
I was in your exact spot 4 years ago. Not fully sure and looking for answers. It may be something that you're newly coming into awareness of, it might even be something someone already knows because when I was three years old I used to pretend my dad's xl shirts were dresses and wanted to play barbies with my cousins and the name I chose happened to be the name my mother was going to name me if I was AFAB
Don't forgeet gender fluid you can be both.

were making a mother of all omelettes here jack...

...cant frett over every egg...
Everyone discovers themselves at a different period of time. 5 years ago, I would have never thought this would be me, but here I am. You are still valid, queen. No matter what. :)
not stupid of you! dysphoria can be hard to recognize at first, but it’s not a requirement to be trans :) if you like your body and it makes you feel confident, more power to you!

also, kalvin garrah is an influencer in the trans community who really pushes the message that to be trans, you have to essentially be miserable and dysphoric always.
Omg they are its Adorable! Looks like we both have good taste 😋
For years if been sitting in the fence thinking I was maybe non binary or something but that it wasn't worth transitioning. When I finally decided I'd actually look into it that was the first site I went to and 🤯. Realised all the signs that is been missing for so long, or all the lies that is been telling myself. I swear if that site had existed 20 years ago I'd be living a very very different life now.
If you want to talk more about feelings and the process feel free to reach out. DMs are open
we all start somewhere! from an egg, to the mother of all omelettes- I'm sorry, I had to.
Of course! I always try to help my people 😤❤
It’s amazing letting our true souls free.
yeah, people who dont identify as men can still be transmasculine, but trans men are technically transmasculine (though some dont like it). transfem and trans woman have a similar difference in meaning
Same to you 🤗
Even tho I say I'm a trans woman I'm really non binary. I don't care about getting surgery and I'm fem most days but no problem being a tomboy.
Food for thought. Good luck however things go
If you determine you're cis, you get a blue checkmark next to your gender.
Exactly! I wore breast forms for close to 10 years before I even started HRT so I could finally start the path of having my own real breasts. It doesn't matter if you even start hrt! Being trans isn't about altering your physical body even though most of us do it. It's about just getting to feel like your genuine self regardless of genetics.

I can give legit tips on cooking, if you'd like.
Do a scramble. Just dice up what you want and cook it like scrambled eggs. Add cheese and a tiny bit if milk at the end... I also like a little butter. It's way better then an omelette, aka egg burrito.
You should watch the Omelette Au Fromage episode of Binging with Babish. I have definitely used that omelette to score points with friends and family.
💀 nanomachines, son...
yikes. I see that's harmful af. thanks for the kindness tho!
omg yes!! i remember watching his videos when i was younger (before i knew he was wrong lol) and it still affects me sometimes. it made me think for years that i couldn’t identify as trans bc i didn’t feel the way that he did lol. messed up
thanks for the offer!
true Chad/Chadette activity!
I think I get it... thank you for clarifying! best wishes!
And if you’re lucky a cool robot army.
lmaoo thats golden

For now could I just have some rum, please? 😳 (I promise my birth certificate says I’m legally allowed to drink even if my maturity level says otherwise 😇
Egg burrito? Anna my friend now you are speaking my LANGUAGE 🤤
you too!
Maybe you're just an undercover girl during day 🖤
I'd totally give you rum if our phone screens allowed teleportation 💔
Ewww no. Only burritos can be burrito!! Blasphemy!!
Ah who am I kidding I got some rum 😝

My boyfriend forbids me from being trans	"I'm 14 years old and MtF and my boyfriend (trans FtM) said that he won't accept me if I ever be trans.
He doesn't know I'm trans because I never told him, he knows I wear makeup and feminine clothing.
What do I even do in this situation? He isn't toxic or anything and he helps me with my anorexia but that situation upsets me and I've been crying for the past few days after he said it.

Update; I came out to him, he started freaking out screaming transphobicnslurs at me and I broke up with him, I don't really think a piece of trash like him deserves anybody. like how can you be trans yet be so transphobic to others (not only me)

Update 2: it really fucking hurts to see all his earlier transphobic messages, why is it so hard to be trans i never got a positive comment about me or my looks i hate being trans"	"That’s definition toxic. You should come out to him so he doesn’t continue to say harmful things to you. And if he does, get outta there
You are 14 years old. The person you're dating right now is not going to be the person you spend the rest of your life with. Therefore you should not be letting him having any influence over the decisions you make. If your transition is a dealbreaker, then break up
Sounds like he just wants a femboy and if that’s not you then get outta there.
that’s weird. you should tell him you’re trans. either he changes because he wasn’t being serious, or you cut it off. him helping you with anorexia shouldn’t be a reason for you to stay.
Your boyfriend shouldn’t be able to forbid you from something like that. That’s controlling and toxic. If he isn’t attracted to women that’s unfortunate, but not his fault, but no healthy partner should stop you from being who you are
How can anyone forbid you from being who you are? I think he is trying to stop you from transitioning. Love is not the same as attachment.
Sounds like you need a new boyfriend. You shouldn't stay with someone who makes you cry.
,,, Not for him to decide. The only thing he *can* decide is that he won't be attracted to you but that's not on you. I hope he's just immature or inarticulate but get out of that relationship anyway.
>said that he won't accept me if I ever be trans


Oh.. This breaks my heart...


>He isn't toxic or anything


Yes he is. The first quote is toxic. ""I will not accept your authentic self"" is absolutely a toxic thing to say.


You're both so very young, and you accept him for who he is. Maybe he's scared because he might believe it affects how he sees his sexuality?


You deserve ppl in your life who want you to be the best you can be. Ppl who truly love you, will champion your authentic self.

If he can't do that for you, then he doesn't deserve to be your friend. I hope he comes around though.
How is a trans person telling another trans person not to be trans? That's the dumbest thing I've ever heard.

But I'm assuming he's 14 as well, so I can confidently say this kid has something going on and he's taking it out on you. Projection is almost always the culprit when kids are mean to each other. 

Listen, he doesn't know shit and you shouldn't listen to him. I'd probably break up with someone if they ever said something like that, but you might be able to talk him out of it. Just don't hold your breath.
Leave him. He's definitely a hypocrite.
Sounds like new boyfriend time. HUGE red flag there.
he “forbids” you? nah. fuck that shit. this little shit’s GONE. other people don’t get to dictate how you wanna live your life.
I guess he is ur ex boyfriend now?
Ew. Sounds like he's a toxic, crappy ex to me. Also, what a hypocrite!
‘he isn’t toxic’ i wouldn’t be so sure about that
Tell them you forbid them from being trans then **shrug** can’t forbid transness while being trans
He's trans but also transphobic? What the fuck.

I'm so glad you stood up for yourself. You're a young woman with your whole life ahead of you. No sense spending it living a lie just to make other people happy.

I hope someday soon this can all just be a distant bad memory of a shitty ex. 💙
I just want you to know that I'm so proud of you for handling the situation how you did as well as recognizing his past transphobia. Coming out to someone you care about and knowing they'll hate you for it is one of the hardest things you can do and it seems like you handled it wonderfully. It's completely okay and normal to be hurt right now. But you're better off without him. Sending hugs! 🥰💖
As a gay trans man...


That's disturbing. And really messed up. I can understand not wanting to be with someone if they come out as trans and transition, I mean hell my ex partner came out as genderfluid and that was part of what led us to our breakup, but to be transphobic about it? And to blame them for it? That's all kinds of fucked up. I'm so sorry you had to deal with that
Leave him. You deserve better.
One can decide to not transition, but not about being trans..
let us level & be on da same playing field:  


if he is just saying you cant transition at all (like in general) then know that is not his decision  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

if he does not want to date you for being trans, that is okay. No one should ever feel obligated to give someone a relationship for any reason. I would just stop dating him because your true selves are not compatible.
That behavior is toxic, nobody should forbid you being who you are! I know you are 14 and maybe can’t see it this way but he is toxic and if he can’t accept it then you’ll meet other people who do. 
I understand what it’s like to be with someone who can’t accept you, don’t make yourself small for him. You deserve someone who cares and accepts you! Also I hope your ED gets better and you can heal 💖
Excuse me for swearing, but your boyfriend is shit and you should come out anyways. I get that he's a nice person but you can't let his opinions define you.

I ended up losing my then girlfriend over my coming out and in retrospect it was the best thing to have happened. Maybe he'll change his mind when you come out, maybe he won't. Whatever his reaction will be you have to stay true to yourself and do what you think is right. Don't let the fear of losing him define who you are.
Well that’s rediculous! Drop that zero and get yourself a hero!
I'm proud of you for breaking up with him. That is not actual love or acceptable behavior. If you truly love someone you want them to be happy no matter what. Even if he ended up not being attracted to women he'd be supportive and amicably end the romantic relationship if you ended up wanting to transition. 

You are valid, go be you now ❤️
I will never be able to wrap my head around people who experience transphobia themselves, and decide to be transphobic themselves... it's like, where is your empathy and compassion? 

I'm sorry he did that to you.
A trans person being transphobic??!!? Thats awful to hear, I'm sorry :<
 take care of yourself. people come and go, it's not worth pulling yourself apart for them... I hope you find the strength to come out and cut out of your life any people who don't accept who you are. Just know that we'll always be here and you'll always be welcome here. We're your friends :)
I'm trans ftm and my partner is mtf, we are slightly older (15 and 16) she came out after we had been together for a long time and I accepted it fully, I don't understand at all how someone can be trans but so ignorant to other people. I am so sorry for you, you deserve someone much better and I assure you there are better people out there :) I promise there is someone else out there who can treat you right and help you with your Ed, and fully accept you for who you are <3 I wish you the best of luck and please break up with him, he sounds absolutely awful
You did the right thing. I'm very proud of you, it can be hard to cut out toxic people sometimes, even harder to open up to them. You made a big decision and whilst it may hurt now you did the right thing, well done.
I don't have any advice. I saw this video that might be helpful though. https://youtu.be/GWeC7bwaIY0
Sorry, he is toxic.  He wants to control you.  Why on earth would one trans person forbid someone else from being trans?  He needs to see a counselor to address his own transphobia.
“What do I even do in this situation?” Leave him. You have bodily autonomy and he doesn’t get to decided what you do/who you are.
Break-ups happen, you don’t need him
When you are young. The problem you face seem bigger then you can handle. It’s just part of it. So I know lot of advice on this page is gonna be dismissive about a 14 year old relationship. 

But it’s also good to know that life is longer then you might know. And you will find more relationships. 

I will say that being yourself is the only choice you can ever make. So don’t put it off and don’t waste too much time with folks who don’t support that choice.
Leave him
I'm glad you did the right thing by letting that person go. They were toxic. We can't really expect to find our soul mate at 14 and the majority of them will end, but you're young so you've got a long way to go. The perfect someone is out there for you and will love you for you \^\^
To the second Update:
Yes it's hard to be trans and often it's totally unfair. I guess the most of us get to the point where we said that we hate it to be trans. But just look at the good side of being trans, I mean we have a big community with people who are supportive. And we get something cis people will never understand, and that's the euphoria we get when we make something that make us pass or make us more feeling like our self. When you hate being pass just try to think at a happy moment you look in the mirror and felt pretty or when you're proud of your make up or something like that. Maybe it will get better with that
I wouldn't have even said anything after the initial threat, just block and ghost, then replace him.

Waste like him dont deserve to know why you abandoned them.
So sorry you had to deal with this. I can’t believe a trans boy would be so openly transphobic especially towards someone he’s supposed to support. It’s good that you ditched him.

I can’t imagine how hard it must be for you right now but you are strong and you are beautiful as you are. Remember that. You will get to a better place where you feel good about yourself and free to live as you truly are. Stay strong sis. Sending love and strength and positive energy your way 💕
Girl, what?? How fucking hypocritical can one get??? ""I can be trans but NO ONE ELSE CAN."" He didn't deserve you. You deserve someone who actually cares about your happiness.
I have…. many questions, but I can tell you that like everyone else said you’re 14. I didn’t date around then but my friends that did don’t even remember the people they “dated” when they were 14. That said I know the bonds are strong but you will be much happier with people who accept you. 

Also… FTM but woul- I’m just gonna press reply
He sounds like a piece of garbage, I'm sorry that he put you through that. You didn't deserve to be treated that way.
break tf up with him
That's sad.
Yeah. Fuck that nerd. Sucks to suck.
Sounds like it's time to forbid him from being your boyfriend! But it's very disappointing and completely uncalled for of him to say those things, seeing as he's trans himself.
Get a new boyfriend!
This will probably go in one ear and out the other but y’all are young and y’all don’t know how to deal with life situations yet. Y’all are in the “training mode” or “tutorial” if you will. Let this show you what you will and will not accept in a partner going forward. People are in your life for a reason or a season so let this teach you a lesson, if anything.
Better to focus on studying than dating right now
some men, trans or cis, are toxic and controlling of their partners.
Being trans is awful 😔
(Edit:I am a trans person and am tired of not being the sex I wish I was, sorry for confusion)
He can't forbid you from doing anything. He can set a boundary, such as ""if you transition, I won't stay in this relationship with you"" (which is still awful) but he does not control you, nor should you be with someone who wants to control you. I would get out of that relationship ASAP. No sense wasting any time on someone who refuses to accept you.
There are others who would accept you for you. He sounds controlling and selfish. Love will find you if it isn’t meant to be.
I must be missing something here. Did you come out to him after you guys got together?
He should love you for who you are and it’s your decision who you get to be as a person. Never let anyone else decide for you. Your still young and there are plenty of fish in the sea, so do what makes you happy. A lot of other good points on here but at the end of the day stay true to yourself.
Controlling behaviour is abuse, plain & simple. it'll only escalate and get worse, sometimes the nicest people can actually be very subversive
Break up! Break up! Break up! Everybody! Break up! Break up! Break up!
Lol wut? F that
You need a new boyfriend. Problem solved.
Hon, anybody who forbids you from being who you are is toxic. I'm glad you broke up with him. He's a serious cunthead
This is truly the worst thing I've read today, Im so sorry this happened to you. Nobody should be hated or harassed for who they are, especially by a loved one or significant other.
We are here for you no one should be treated that way we're all humans too
i don't know why some trans people treat other trans people like that, it's shit. you deserve better then that, i'm glad it ended. you have a long, long time for things to get better. and they will.
being a transphobic trans person is wild, i’m sorry you had to deal with that OP. you’ll find someone better 💜
Ew sweetie please find a nice boy instead
Won't lie and say that being trans is easy, from what I've seen and heard it's difficult. Don't let that discourage you from being your true self though! Things worth working for are rarely easy to achieve, that doesn't mean we shouldn't strive for them.
a trans phobic trans kid...   run my dear.
wow this is hard. came after the edits, i am so sorry. im glad you broke up with him. i can tell you that being trans is indeed hard, but things get easier over time. plus your 14, you have so many years ahead of you :)
Get out. This person is toxic and doesn't care about the real you. You are young and deserve better. don't settle!
What level of self-hate IS this dude?!  
How someone can be both trans and refuse to accept that other people are is beyond my comprehension.
Mate, he either hates you, is a bad person, is sexist, has internalized Transphobia, or all of the above.

I personally would say he probably has a bunch of internalized Transphobia, but he also probably is an abusive shit too.
I believe you are strong, and that you deserve so much better than this. You are not alone, and your life is so meaningful and important, and I know it can be difficult, so if you need someone to listen, we are here for you.
BREAK UP WTF
If there’s one thing I learned through this community as I don’t do enough research or interact with too many trans-community members. Is that, someone may or may not be trans, and may or may not be an ally or have a trans friend, can still be transphobic, whether it’s publicly, or internally (which can be selective). Thank globs you left that trash immediately, you’re young, you have a brighter future than wasting a single moment with people like that.
Fuck his opinion, be you, you are 14, plenty of time, plenty of fish.
That ""he isn't toxic or anything comment"" really aged like milk
Break up! If there’s one lesson you should learn from this, it’s that you don’t date people who disrespect you! 

BTW, I would be careful about leaning on a partner for help with your ED or any other mental illness. A healthy individual won’t want to manage that for you, and anyone who does is looking for a way to control you. Stay safe!
Being trans is a journey. It'll take some time, and it'll take some heartbreak for most of us, but there will be a day where EVERYONE will see you as you, no matter who you are.

You're loved, even if it's by a random stranger on the internet. You can get through this.
Wait, so your trans male boyfriend can transition, but you can't...

And hates trans people, thats some questional logic
gurl you are better off without him.

I can't speak to your relationship as a whole, but knowing that he's that unsupportive and even transphobic, I say bullet dodged.

You deserve to have someone who can be supportive of your personal journey no matter what it looks like. stay strong. I know what it feels like to go through those feelings and it's not easy but it does get better. Just know that you made the right choice.
Transphobia from a trans person. Hm never thought I would see that!
I‘m really sorry that happened to you.
so sorry that happened to you. he's very toxic and it's good you broke up with him.
Forbid him from being your boyfriend and move on.
Leave him.
Yeah, dump him.
This is toxic behavior.  You'll be doing yourself a favor by cutting him out of your life.
He just likes what he likes. 
Your relationship won’t work cuz he is not into trans people. It sucks but it happens and is no one’s fault. You can remain as friends.
fuck them. find someone better. you are young being 14 is not a good time to worry about relationships tallimg from expierience. 
sorry for bad english it is not my native language
I support who you are he is just a dickhead i hope your doing well now 🫶
This!!!
Just to add to this, it doesn't matter how old you are, nobody should have that kind of influence over you. Even if you're 60 and been with someone for 40 years, they shouldn't be allowed to tell you who you can or can't be and stop you from being yourself.
this this someone go back in time and tell me this
Also you’re only 14 years old. The person you are right now is not going to be the person you end up being the rest of your life. Be true to who you are. Ask lots of questions to the people you are closest to and love most and be open to what they have to say.
Wise
It’s wild to see people so young all over the internet lol.  I’m not that old but ten years ago was so different
that's the entire point, he brags to everyone that he has a ""femboy"" and tells me everyday how much he likes femboys
When I tried to come out to him, he said he hates trans woman and that he will never accept me as one
Weak take. Alternate phrasing: shouldn't stay with someone who doesn't care how you feel.
Thank you a lot
not that easy though
I passed the national English competition and have 100% on all of my finals
Some *people**
The way you worded it i think is why you are being downvoted. It is struggling and a lot of people do not accept us, but to us it isn’t awful.
i didn't but he made multiple comments on that if I become trans he won't accept me and he won't date me anymore
I’m so sorry that you got that response. But it’s better to cut people like that out of your life. You’re one step closer to accepting your Transness and surrounding yourself with people who support and love you. I know it’s hard right now but you will find your people.
Yes ma’am. *claps*
Real
Why aren’t people taught this when they’re younger?
Sounds like he's fetishizing you instead of accepting you for who you are.
Please just dump him. He's not good for you.

Trans people can be transphobic too.
That's super fetishy, especially for a 14 year old. You might wanna steer clear of this guy.
Ooof yah that’s fetishizing…
That's gross.
Unless you call yourself a femboy that kind of behavior is not ok.
100% this, it’s gross fetishizing and controlling, I cannot urge you more to break up with him asap. Be safe and surround yourself with people who will help build you up into the person you need to be to be happy!
Definitely fetishising, maybe it’s time you took a break or had an honest conversation with him.
Then he sounds like a bigot. I have no idea what kind of bigotry if it’s towards trans women specifically, but that’s bigotry and it’s preventing him from being a healthy partner for you
i concur, my partner makes me cry (of relief, joy, and love) quite often
I know, but the journey doesn’t start until you take the first step!
Better single than a shitty partner, always. It’s a hard lesson to learn, but it’s a good one and necessary. You’ll find someone who loves you for who you are and doesn’t seek to change or “forbid” any harmless or authentic expression of yourself, and if it’s takes a while, I promise it will be worth the wait. You’re very young, and there’s a lot of stuff you’re gonna learn over time, especially during your teenage years. I know I did. Only 22 and I’m still learning a lot. 

But as in all matters of love, choose yourself first. By which I mean, make sure the person you are with makes you feel like someone who is free to be yourself, you are truly happy and not having to make excuses for their shitty behavior, and you don’t have to convince yourself that you deserve or have to put up with abuse.
Wow, that's awesome! As for your relationship, you need to be honest, because they'll find out sooner or later, and if they can't accept you as you are the relationship won't work no matter what.
Thank you, I meant I’m so tired of being trans and just wish I could have been born right…
Did you ask him why it's such a big issue when he is already Trans?
Because most of us wouldn't have listened.
Transmisogyny is the word for it. It’s probably got a lot to do with his own dysphoria, tbh - I used to be really uncomfortable around trans men for the same reason until I worked through my own issues and started medically transitioning - but that doesn’t mean it’s any less toxic for you, OP, and you should not let that get in the way of your own transition, especially if you have a chance to get puberty blockers.
Sounds like internalised misogyny.
Teenagers hate being told their current experiences and relationships are temporary, and while they have a role in shaping who they grow up to be, very little of what happens in teenage years actually matters on adult life. 

And I understand why. It ultimately trivializes their lived experiences and all that. I remember the feeling vividly even though I’m on the other side of it now. 

But it’s no less true. Nothing from high school matters at all in the real world.
That, and the fact that the older generations expect everyone to marry young as they did. So they just assume young people just know that and/or comprehend it.
That’s not true.. other cultures raise teenagers much differently than Americans do and they do listen and mature better then we do
No Im pretty sure he’s externalizing it…
that and general transmisogyny
God I know exactly how you feel. You don't want to tell a person that their lived experiences aren't especially relevant...
I don't think older generations saw anything wrong when a man was controlling
With all due respect, teenagers are teenagers no matter where you go. None of them have a full front lobe until they're like 25. 

No amount of cultural influence makes teenagers less stubborn and short sighted.
That's the literal definition of internalise, in this case it is internalising the misogyny so much it becomes part of their nature and attitude towards others.

""PSYCHOLOGY
make (attitudes or behaviour) part of one's nature by learning or unconscious assimilation.
""people learn gender stereotypes and internalize them""""
For real. And at that age emotions and such are so intense… 

It’s a fine line trying to point out that nothing happening will really matter in the long run without being too diminutive. Like their feelings are no less valid because they’re still kids. But their sense of time is not really developed yet - a year still feels like such a long time - and it’s hard to impossible to see things with a wider perspective when you don’t have the lived experiences to see that perspective. 

I just want them to know and understand that it’ll be okay and before they know it all the teenage drama will be no more than a memory with no tangible impact on their life.
Your definitely not wrong .. I definitely could have worded my response better.. I just have also seen a difference in how American teenagers are treated versus teenagers in say Denmark and there is some level of difference in learned maturity because of the difference in approaches
Teenagers are also literally at a physical disadvantage as well. Their frontal lobes are not developed yet, which makes decision making so much more wishy washy. Teens have a hard time fathoming long term consequences. I remember when I learned that while I was a teen and it made so much stuff that I did, and my peers did, make much more sense lol.

It also helped me make more informed decisions. Of course I was like 16 when I learned this so I didn't have too many more years ahead of me as a teen."	ytgho7	trans	1039	0.95	2022-11-12 19:45:57

You look great!!! Hope you have a good new year :]

Looking good.
I think I can speak for your audience.. was more than worth it! You’re a beauty, and we love the goth motif!

My daughter is showing signs of being transgender	Or should I say son. My CHILD who is 8 years old is showing signs of being transgender and I don't know how to go about this. She doesn't like having long hair, only likes wearing boy clothes, only hangs out with boys etc. She even told me once she wishes she was a boy. Maybe I'm thinking too deep into this but I want what's best for her. Do I wait until she's older to talk about this?	"I was like your daughter short hair amd boys overalls. Mom wanted me in dresses with darn bows. Just let her be her. Don't make guesses. I turned out female cis and straight. Just a tomboy kind of woman. Let her know she is perfect as she is. Let her know you hear her when she talks. Please no dresses with bows.
You can talk enough for them to understand; remember that having 8 transitioning is only a social thing.
Maybe they are just a more masculine woman, that is also valid; maybe they are fluid.
Ask them nicely what they feelike or what they think their soul (or something is)
You can even roleplay some situations or play some board games or such and ask why they choose the chara ters they choose.
I dont know where You are from, but maybe do a consultatio with a therapist with gender oriented practice.
It's never too early, it's never too late.
And it's really lovely to see you here, let me talk on behalf of a lot (maybe most) of trans here, we wish we had such caring and preoccupied parents.

Be safe out there.
What is best for her right now is to let her explore without judgement. Her hair, clothes and social life are superficial. Follow her lead. At some point, if the behaviour persists, consider getting some counselling. There is a world of difference between being Gender Non-Conforming (""GNC"") and transgender
I think the best thing you can do for her (I say her because you don't know if she's actually transgender)is to show her love and support. Make sure she understands it's ok to be lesbian, gay, bi, trans etc. That way you make it easier for her if she actually one day finds out that she's trans, or lesbian, or gay or whatever.

Don't be afraid of thinking ""what if"", deal with it if it ""happens"".But at this point, I would not ask her if she's feeling like a boy.
r/cisparenttranskid could be good to look into    There is nothing u would do now anyway so just support ur child. U don't necessarily need to bring anything up now
I’d really just let your kid lead the way and do what she wants for now. Maybe let her know she can be a boy if she wants to and that’s okay with you or introduce her to the concept of trans people/being trans in a non-pushy way. Just let her figure herself out and do what feels right for/to her in the moment & support her while she does it. And in the background & the meantime educate yourself on stuff you might not know, even if your kid doesn’t end up being trans you’ll still be in a better place to support other trans people in your life.
Consult with a kid‘s therapist who cares for trans as well as cis kids. From this alone your kid could be either.  
If you have trouble finding one, contact local lgbt support groups. They often have contacts and can warn you about crooks.  

Thing is, your kid might just be a tomboy, or there might be a lot your kid cannot express to you and a professional might help get that out.  
My family was never aware of the extent my misery and mistaking *that amount* with a cis kid would have been impossible if only someone knowledgeable had talked to me imho.  
Conversely, I have cis tomboy friends who were happy just being allowed to be their tomboy selfe and be „one of the boys“ as a girl.  

If there was one thing that would have helped me, that would have been a parent who told me it‘s okay, I‘ll be fine and no one will force me to be a girl.
I hope I’m not being transphobic here but like I now tons of kids who do things of the opposite gender and that’s no a warranty they are trans. As long as you always try to support your children and be there for them when THEY need you, don’t push anything would be the core point of this response
Let her be for now shes only 8
When she reaches 11-12 and if the feelings still persist heavily (her fashion has nothing to do with it im talking about her saying she wants to be a boy) then you can consider puberty blockers until she has more time and becomes an even older age to figure things out. 

Point being is you dont need to worry at all for at least 3-4 more years where you can then decide if you need to buy her even more time.
They just could be a tomboy, a masculine girl. Liking ""Boys"" things =/= being trans.
Just let her do what she wants to do. Just because she once told you she wishes she was a boy doesn't have to mean she's trans. It can stem from something simple like being excluded from play by the boys, that happens. At that age it doesn't really matter, just get her the clothes and toys she wants.
I just say to let them experiment and explore. Let them wear the clothes they wish, if they need a binder let em try it. Don't encourage them but don't discourage them either, you want them to take the lead. Maybe contact a doctor though cause gender clinics can take a very long time to contact and just so you know what you're options are if they are a trans dude. Just be supportive, that's the best thing you can do
Let her dress how she wants and express herself how she wants for now (this should be a no brainer for any parent), but I think there's a difference between her saying ""I think I want to be a boy"" once and actually being a transgender boy. Don't make any changes until she comes to you and tells you ""I think I am transgender,"" (if she ends up doing that at all), then the best choice would be to go to a gender therapist. 

The best thing you can do for now is show her that you are supportive of trans people - if she ever brings the topic up (many trans kids do this with your parents to see if they would be supportive of them, and also we are just a ""hot button issue"" at the moment haha) let her know you're supportive.
I think just let your child do what they want right now. If they bring it up to you, then it's time to have that conversation, however wanting to wear boy clothes / shorter hair isn't inherently transgender. It's not uncommon for someone who identifies as a woman to wish that they were a boy due to the social privileges that boys get.

Kinda hard to say for sure until you hear the words directly from your child's mouth. I think just let them dress and act how they want, because that will be good for them either way. I think that just showing them that you're supportive in general by letting them dress/ act how they want will be enough to let them know that they can talk to you about it if they do wind up questioning their gender identity.
Gender(ed) expression and gender identity are different things. These can be signs of her being trans or she might simply prefer the aesthetic and want to be a tomboy (aka cis girl/woman who prefer to present a more masculine aesthetic, which is valid as well). She will figure it out herself which one it is. Just be supportive of whatever she does.
You're years out from any medical intervention, if that's where any of your worries lie. Just treat your kid how they want to be treated, and maybe revisit the question later on. Make sure they know it's an option, of course, but... y'know. Leave it up to them. They'll let you know.

The fact you're on here at all, and that you're looking for advice from other people that may know more, means you're headed in the right direction.
Just keep giving them autonomy and letting them explore. Ask if they want to try having you call them by he/him pronouns or they/them or any other pronouns, even just at home or something, and to let you know if they change their mind. And ask if there’s a name or nickname they’d rather be called by.
I can only give advice from personal experience. I said the same when I was a child and I am trans but I only came out in my 30s. Thank you for thinking of your child, it takes all our lives to truly learn who we are. I would have loved to have had someone like you as a child to talk to. I was a little internally transphobic toward myself because it was never taught to me as a child that it’s ok to be who you truly are and so thats why it took me a long arse time to finally admit to myself that I am a trans man and once I accepted myself (for the first time ever) I started becoming excited for my future. I wish you all the best take care.
I’d say just be open for them to talk to for now. Try to make it clear where you stand on gender identity issues so that that there’s less mystery for them with how you might react. Your child is getting close to puberty or may be starting puberty and there are meds to delay that if they become uncomfortable with it. 

If your child is become obviously depressed or distressed with life, that may be where it’s a good idea to say “you know you once told me you wished you had been born a boy. If that’s something you want to talk about more, I’m here to listen.” I can’t relate to coming out as trans but I can relate to coming out queer and it’s easiest to do when you have a really long conversation with somebody and they make it clear in that conversation how they feel and that they’re someone to trust. My mom, as a boomer, speaks awkwardly about gender and sexual orientation so I’ve always had a lot of anxiety talking to her about issues and never been comfortable doing it even though it’s been over a decade since she forced me to come out to her. 

I think it can be difficult to tell where the line is between incorrect cultural preconceptions on gender roles and gender expression, and someone actually being transgender, so it’s just important to give your child a safe space to talk about what they feel in terms of their own gender. And that may mean giving them more time to talk about gender before going through puberty. Children assigned female can sometimes go through puberty too young and even cis girls may need puberty blockers so it’s never a bad idea to keep that in mind and talk to a pediatrician if you need to.
There are literally 0 consequences from teaching your child about trans people and the gender spectrum aside from making them a more respectable human being.

Children's transitions are only social anyways; talk to them, and if they want to be a boy, let them be a boy, call them their pronouns/name, buy them clothes they like, etc; if the next they they want to be non-binary, let them be non-binary, if they come back to you and say they actually think they are a girl after all, don't punish them for it.

Experimenting is a good thing nobody should be ashamed of, and the outcome shouldn't matter as long as they are happy; make sure they know they can aproach you with questions and shouldn't be afraid of not being 100% sure of who they are
To all of you suggesting therapy: if the kid is depressed, that’s one thing, but being trans isn’t a pathology. Let the kid be who they decide they are. They don’t need a shrink to figure that out.
My children understood the concept of being trans at a very young age in kindergarten. I am trans and told my kids my heart is that of a girl. My children told me then that they want to be their assigned gender. 
We talked some more times. Because my son likes skirts and dresses. I bought a book about a football playing boy in a skirt. He liked that.
He is still a cis boy.
I think most important is that your children know that there are alternatives and role models and most importantly that it’s okay to try it and you support them.
yes, wait until she's older. for now, please just let her be who she wants to be! also, make sure she knows about lgbtq+ people - when i was younger i had no idea being trans was a thing. if i had, i would have figured out that i was trans sooner, and probably would have been much happier.

there are a lot of trans men who are like that when they're younger, but there's also a lot of cis women who are like that! for example, me and my primary school best friend - from about 6 to 10 years old, we both wanted to be boys, only wore boy's clothes and *hated* anything stereotypically feminine. i am now a man, but after 10 she started to dress more feminine again and like 'girly' stuff more. she's still more of a tomboy than most, but she is a woman.

let your kid express themselves however they want. let them choose how they want to act and present. just support them. one day, possibly they'll change their mind, and possibly they'll come to you to talk about it.
just let your kid live the way that they want to, if they want short hair, masculine clothing, ect., just let them do it for now and when they grow up they will most likely become more aware of trans people and also how they feel, if they decide thats who they are then support them! 

i dont think it would be best to impose it on them that your child is a boy just due to them dressing they way they want to or liking shorter hair, however if they continue to persist that they are a boy as they grow up then you can support him in that! but if they grow up and decide they are a masculine girl then cool support her for that! or a nonbinary or genderfluid, it all depends — but imposing anything like that when they are still little then it could harm the way they see themselves if they are cis or nonbinary/genderfluid, just tell them you support however they want to dress or be for the time being and then go from there! 😊
I'd have a conversation sometime soon but of course at both your and their own pace. The fact that you've noticed all this and are willing to go thr extra mile shows so much character and I'd be so lucky to have you as a parent! I think as long as you put everything out on the table before puberty your child will have such an amazing life and without regret ❤
My approach (to begin with) is helping your kid with what they want, they want new boy clothes you get em boy clothes and so on. The most important part is to show you’re supportive of trans people and an ally so your kid feels safe with being trans (if that’s the case) and you have to love your kid no matter what ends up happening and you’re good :)
Children should express themselves for who they are. That said, physical changes to gender expression like surgery arent relevant before or during puberty. All of this can be consulted with doctors.
I'd let your kid lead on what they want to do , who they hang with, how they look, as long as your cool with them, they'll trust you & you'll be in a much better position to be there as they need you be, just let them be them & let it be natural
Give them the time and support they need. Don’t feel like you need to pressure a label onto them. They’re a kid. It’s good to talk about it, but just know they’re figuring themselves out. When they know and are ready to tell you they will. As long as you’re in their corner all the way, that’s what matters
Teach them abt trans ppl
I came out at 8 and having accepting parents made my life great
You really don't have to do much but make sure they feel safe to come to you with whatever their truth happens to be.  No point in muddying the waters with projections or guessing. Just give it time, love, support, security, etc. Keep it simple.
""she wishes she was a boy""

Your child could be trans, if you're comfy with having a conversation about being a boy or a girl (not physically) I think you should.
The best thing you can do for your kid is accept them. They may be trans, they may not be, just make sure they know that you love them either way. 

Also, most trans kids(and transgender people in general) are in more pain when you try to push things: clothes, hobbies, hair. It is important to make sure that they can do as they wish when it comes to these things and not assigning gender to any of it
I say for now just let you kid do whatever they want, let them know as they get older that they shouldn't feel like not talking is the safe option if they have problems, be it identity, sexuality, or just basic things like relationships

You could have a trans son, you could also have a daughter that just really hates long hair and dresses.
Check out this video with your kid and tell them that you will support and love them and you will try your best to be at least as good as that mum [yt video](https://youtu.be/cuIkLNsRtas)
It's his journey.  Let him discover who he is on his own and just be there to support him.
I think just do some research into how to support a trans kid, encourage them to explore the things they like and bare it in mind for if they ever come out to you :) also they're very lucky to have you be so supportive
Im not to speak for your child, but i was the same. I told my mum when i was 4 that i was a boy and wanted to be a ‘real’ boy. Id see keep an eye out on them, and also keep in mind that they could just be a masc female! <3 best of luck to you and your child
Ask your child what they want! Children know what they want and being supportive in their gender journey, wherever it may go, will be HUGE for them. Talk to them directly about it and ask them what they want to do amd help them do that. If they want to try out different haircuts and clothes, help them with that. If they want to use a different name or pronouns, even if just in the house with close family, help them with that

Also, it could help to asl them about their gender, like next time you child says they want to be a boy, ask them more about it, help them work out those feelings if they aren't clear and make it clear that you support their journey wherever it may go
Encourage accept and talk with your child? Ask her / him what they think and maybe most importantly don’t jump to conclusions or to define things

I’m a pretty affirmed grown ass adult who has been struggling with my identity a lot (I mean a LOT) lately and I don’t know if I’m trans or what but the part that most intensely hurts and I just can’t seem to find is who I am and have anyone that I can really talk about that with who wants to listen and see ME

Whatever I am and hear about my feelings and frustrations without trying to push me to be anything and maybe give my weird ass some affirmation that I’m worth being me whatever that is

I admit this is more of a personal rant but maybe helps?

I don’t have any insight into her / his mind but I guess my point is that even for such a young age maybe the person that has the most insight is the child and the best support you can offer is to be open to your child about not only supporting them but wanting to know from them what they think and who they are

Tl;dr

I wish I felt like there was someone in life who cared enough to ask this:

https://youtu.be/aYkuuu9u3EI

And then maybe tell me it’s okay to not know or that they’re confident I can figure it out
I was the same way as a kid and my mom shoved what she wanted me to be down my throat. Wouldnt allow me to express myself .. all it left were years of confusion.. self harm, self hatred, drug addiction and more. I feel as though its a crucial time to find out who you are. Sometimes it could just be a phase.. or maybe not. Allowing them to be figure that out without judgement is the best thing you can do. Be supportive no matter what. They might not know what they want yet, or maybe they do.. just be supportive and non judgemental and only time will tell. I couldve blossomed if i had had my parents support..instead i tore myself apart
I knew when I was 3 but the world around me told me that I had to be a girl, I was always unhappy about being forced into that role, it took me untill I was 22 to realize that I could transition and just like most of us I wish I'd started sooner.

Your child is a child, let them identify however makes them happy, if they decide to change that due to the way they feel about it changing or due to peer pressure or bullying then let them change the way they identify again to be more comfortable. When they're old enough to make decisions about their physical health then let them do that too.

Just be supportive and kind.
I mean I did all those things up until I Waa 18..minus the wishing I was a boy and I'm not transgender. A full Tom boy. Even now at 25 all my friends are guys.
make sure they know you love them and are a safe person to confide in and make sure they know trans people exist and they will come to you when they are ready.
I'd say let your kid dress how they prefer and play with toys they like I recommend waiting until the 14-16 year range unless they bring up the topic
Make sure ur child knows they are free to express themselves and let them come to you when they’re ready to talk about it if they do end up being trans
They did say that they wish they were a boy, but since they're so young idk... Could just be their way of saying they wished they fit into a masculine demographic better? But I can totally understand why you'd question their gender. Maybe I'd just let it be for now. It wouldn't hurt to explain what being trans is, even to seemingly cis kids, but just let them explore themselves & the idea of gender identity. Like, if you explain transgenderism, don't say you are because you think they may be trans. If they come to that conclusion themselves, then social transition wouldn't hurt. I'm glad you're an accepting parent & I wish you the best.❤️
So I’m a trans guy that came from a (at first) not supportive household. My advice is to let your kid explore their hairstyle, clothes, etc,.. without judgement. Make sure they know what being lgbtq+ is and that it’s okay, without making them feel like they are now definitely a part of it if they’re more masc! Masculine women exist too and everything is completely valid:>
I feel like the best thing to do it is just let then be their self until they can figure out weather they are trans them selves. Especially when they are that young its best to let them continue to learn who they are on their own terms. If they are trans they'll find out eventually.
Don't guess about your child.  Just support and affirm their identity and expression.  But there's always a place  for cleanliness at least once a day.
Any clothing or hairstyle preferences say nothing about someone's gender. Your kid saying they want to be a boy is what tells you that they are a boy.
Make sure to teach them that it's okay to be this way. Many of us grew up thinking we're monsters, or a subject of a comedy, somebody who should laugh at.
the wishing to be a boy thing is kind of a giveaway but if de is de’ll probably tell you once de figured it out denself
And have some age appropriate books around the house just to help give them more words to help talk about what they might be experiencing. There’s a lot of really good fiction and nonfiction out there right now! 💖
First, thank you for being a great parent!

The fact that you're reaching out for help shows you love and care about your child.

All you need to do is love and support them in their decisions. If they ask for help, help! If you need help this is a great place to find it.
the best thing you can do for your child is talk to them and listen. they may be trans and not want to come out rn or they may just not be at all. either way listening to your kid about their feelings about it is super important :)
These posts make me do happy, I’m so glad there are parents looking to understand and learn! ☺️
I was gonna say “don’t assume that stuff maybe they’re a tomboy, if they’re trans she’d tell you” but then they say they wished they were a boy and I was like “oh”
i think the best thing to do is to just let her express herself how she wants and when shes ready she'll tell you herself. she may be trans or she may just be a tomboy yk? when shes ready and knows she'll let you know.

i was just like this when i was younger and i'm now a trans dude, but i also have friends who were/are super masculine who are cis women. What matters most is that you support your kids fashion and hair choices and if she does come to realise shes trans she'll know youre on her side.
I lived in a traditional household , there’s nothing more wrong then forcing your child to be or wear something they dont feel comfortable with. I turned out to be a transwoman but living in a traditional household was pretty hard to me to come out. So please let your child be how they wanna be.
Just do what everyone in the 90s did when I was growing up - call your kid a Tom Boy, say ""she'll grow out of it"" and then let them suffer with gender dysphoria for their entire life until at 35 they finally accept their own trans-ness and start hormone therapy. JK!

The kid is already lucky to have a parent who is aware of transgender issues and wants to do the right thing. They sound just like me when I was a ""little girl"" and no I did not grow out of it, so I would follow the kid's lead - keep staying open to what they are expressing, and maybe get them in to see a therapist who is competent in working with trans youth.

Godspeed!
Just support them now, show that you’re listening to them and if they want short hair and boyish clothes then give them that to your ability. If you show you’re willing to listen now, if it’s as simple as a haircut or as uncomfortable as a name/pronoun change, then your kid will be more comfortable talking to you about it later. I was a kid that knew super early, it’s possible, just love them and listen.
Just let your child know you are accepting. Tell them you'll love them no matter what, and take steps to show it. However they end up identifying, they'll tell you when they're ready. Not every kid that shows ""signs"" is trans, and not every child that doesn't make it ""obvious"" isn't. I was the latter. No matter how your child expresses themself, just let them know you'll accept them and let them come to you in time. That's all I ever wanted.
I wouldn't go straight to her being trans at 8 years old. Just let her be her, being a girl and not wanting to dress in dresses doesn't mean she was born in the wrong body. She could simply be a ""tomboy"". When she's older, she can tell you how she feels herself. Don't assume. Just be supportive and let it come from her naturally. And hopefully you being as supportive and kind as you can be in every day situations, will lead her to feeling like she can be open with you for any reason she may have.
Maybe she'll turn out to be trans, maybe she's a ""tomboy.""  Just make sure your kid knows you'll always love & support her no matter what, and everything will work itself out either way.
Support your kid. That’s all. They’ll come to their own conclusion and if they feel safe around you they’ll let you know.
Give them like 2 more minutes. I mean, they’re 8 years old, took me until I was 16 to figure it out and I showed 0 signs, have to assume it works the other way around too
Honestly I would have loved to just be accepted. Let your child know that you support them (to put a pronoun) and love as how they are, not pressuring them to be someone they're not. By your post it doesn't seem you are, and that's really important.

I want to start saying idk nothing about kids lol. If you haven't talked to them about the LGBTIQA+ community, maybe start with that - just as another lesson, not directed at their identity. That way if they ever need it, they already know the tools to talk about their feelings and experiences and understand them. Who knows, maybe even something clicks and they say ""hey, that sounds like me!"" when something resonate. If not, that's ok too, I would leave it at that for now.

If you think it's a good idea, how about playing with pronouns, different names and so... Through actual games? Just letting them know it's a possibility (and maybe trying you too to give them some confidence). Like a board/ roleplay game where you can be any character you want, it doesn't have to be exactly that but with creativity I think the idea could be useful.

It may be signs that your child is trans. It may be not. Your kid may take some time to figure it out, and hey, if she isn't, she learns about LGBTIQA+ people and have some fun.
Wait until she talks to you. Kids can outgrow all of the things you mentioned. If it persists into being a teenager/young adult it’s more likely she’s either a girl who isn’t into stereotypical girly things or could be transgender like you think. Let her be a kid for now and explore what she likes on her own.
Honestly? Just love him/her. That it’s the most big support you can bring to your child, be alert for if him/her wanna talk to you. Don’t rush. 🥰
My advuce, because she could just be a tomboy, get them on puperty blockers, medicine that prrvents puperty from happening, and puperty is more or less what causes gender dysphoria. And its completely revesible, once you stop taking it, puperty happens as if nothing happened. Its essentially used to give the child more time to decide what they feel like. 

Second, try to just inform them that its okay to be transgender if they are. Don't try to influence their decision at all. So dont make being transgender a good or bad thing. That its just a thing.
You aren't reading too much into it. Those are some strong signs of being trans. I'm not a parent, put I know what I wish my parents had done for me.

The first thing I would do in your shoes is find out if they like their name, if they want a nickname. If they have a very feminine name like Jasmine, they might prefer something more neutral like Riley, or something more masculine like Ed/Edward. I've found that when it comes to parents, even if they are accepting, getting a new name down can be really hard.

Next, I would make sure that whatever clothes, haircuts, toys, games, etc they like, you support them and back them up if anyone tries to make fun of them for it.

And don't be afraid to show them movies/shows that have trans representation so they know they aren't the only person who feels like this. Because I never had that and the feeling that I was broken, or something was wrong with me was crushing.

If you do all that, when it's time to talk about it, they have the trust and the words to talk to you with. (Also, try to wait and have them sit you down for that conversation).

The last thing is, make sure you have a good doctor/shrink on standby. When they start going through puberty, they might freak out a bit. If they haven't talked to you about it by then, that's the time when you need to sit down and have a talk about it. If they do feel like they're trans, make it a priority to get them on puberty blockers ASAP.

The current process (im the US anyway) is that the kid has to be in therapy while their on puberty blockers so that when they turn 18, they'll know for sure if they are trans and be able to start taking proper hormone therapy, so once they're on puberty blockers and in therapy, it's just support them, experiment with pronouns as needed, and play the waiting game.

Hope this helps.
I'd say start by asking more questions. Have a long talk with them! But make sure to never tell them who you think they are, let them do that for you.
Just keep loving your child no matter what she goes by or chooses to wear. Let her wear more masculine clothing/cut her hair if that’s what she wants. Maybe you should get her to talk to a therapist or better yet talk to her yourself about her gender. Since she expressed wanted to be a gender other than the one she was assigned at birth she may be trans, so I’d say start therapy sooner than later.
she may be just a tomboy. let her hit puberty.
Talk about it if it continues get them a counselor
When I was young I only liked wearing girls clothes and I would cry if my hair was cut short these are signs to look out for
Definitely wait until they’re a teen. Assure them that it’s fine to feel this way and dress a certain way. But don’t dive deeper yet
Just go with it. Let them know you accept them for them and if they are they’ll come it fully when she’s ready. You’re doing great not forcing them into society’s bounds. Just enjoy life with your child and let them know you’ll always love and accept them
Way too deep. She’s 8. When I was 8 I wore boy clothes and only hung with the boys, to some extent I wished I was a boy so I could belong, not because I felt I was in the wrong body. I am still completely straight and still fine in my body I was born in. People need to stop projecting onto children.
Her gender expression has nothing to do with her being transgender. Even if she says she wants to be a boy, she's only 8 so there's plenty of time to figure stuff out.
Wait until they’re a teenager and a bit more understanding of the concept of trans before asking them. Just tell them that if they ever have anything they want to tell you, that you’ll be supporting of them? Idk I’m not even an adult yet.
Wait until puberty.
I think your son is telling you as best he knows how that he's a boy.
There’s nothing for you to do. It’s not your life
Walk away. Just walk away.  At that age its most likly a phase.  I wouldnt worry till there in there teens.
First off, most children that age should be having fun not worrying about gender (not my “Matt Walsh idealistic view” just a general thing I think, just like most younger kids don’t worry about taxes or food or depression etc), although I also told my mum when I was like 5 that I wish I was a girl, so idk, but I’m glad u can be supportive at least :) that’s the best thing I think, just let them feel comfortable and they should tell you if they have anything to say
Nope, there's no reason to hide transgemderism from kids, regardless of what Conservatives are crying about. There's also no reason to control, sanction, or limit how your child wants to present. They may be trans, they may not. 

The best thing you can do is learn about what it means to be trans and support them in presenting how they want. Other parents may have a problem with this but your kid's sense that you have their back is more important.
www.genderdysphoria.fyi is a wonderful source of information for this circumstance.
If you want to talk to your child about it you can but what's most important is supporting them. 

If they want to have short hair let them, if they want to wear certain clothes let them. Who knows maybe one day they'll discover they are transgender or it may not be the case. 

But overall letting your kid express themselves is important and just letting them do what makes them happy without judgment is a good way to support
Don't wait.

If your kid is trans, the sooner you embrace that, the more seen/accepted/validated they will feel and that is a huge gift you can give them.

As others have said, being trans when you're 8 is purely a social thing: change your clothes/hair/name, and that's that. Use the time between now and puberty to explore whether this is truly the path they want for their life, and if so, get them on puberty blockers and/or hormone therapy so their body can develop as much according to their gender identity as possible.
Speak with them and let them know you're concerns. If they're actually transmasculine, then that's their choice and as a parent, you need to understand, but if you can't understand transgender folks, them all that's needed is that you support them for who they are. Anyone at any age will find out their identity at any point in their life, and it's something we as a parent or human needs to figure out in life, like everyone figures out who they are and will do what's necessary for them. Your child is showing signs, so you could talk with them and have this talk to learn about the LGBT community, and if it's something they're comfortable knowing and figuring out that it's who they are, then that's great. But if they don't know or don't want to know more about, then it's because they might think you're on to them and aren't gonna support them. So best is to support them right now for what they look like, and wait until they are comfortable talking to you about the feeling.

TLTR: Just support them until the time they decide who they are, and then support them after as well
My son is 7 years old, and he came out about wanting to be a boy a year ago. We took him seriously but started small. Little things like hair, clothes, and using a more ""boy sounding"" nickname.

When school started, he was emphatic that he wanted to be seen as one of the boys.

Thankfully, the school has trans inclusion policies and have been more than happy to accommodate him. (Bonus, we found an ally in the school's office clerk who has a NB nibbling [gender neutral nephew/niece] so they have been very open minded.)

Now, he's 7 and he has never been happier. I look at older pictures in his long hair, and even when he's goofy... there's a sadness that I never see anymore.

Plus, him learning himself helped me be open with myself for the first time in 20 years.

Maybe I'm more empathetic as a parent who is also trans, but for a long time I kept my mouth shut around them about it. I was scared to be labeled an ""influence""

Then he told me, completely out of the blue one day ""Mom, I'm a boy up here, like you're a girl up there."" (Our brains) ""but I'm a girl down here, just like you're a boy down there. But that's nobody’s business!""

It was such a self aware thing for him, as a child, to say, so I realized that day that our kids are way smarter than we think!!
Let your kid just be a kid. She is still young and discovering the world, no need to hurry into anything.

Some girls like that grow up into tomboys. Some grow up to be lesbians. For some it is just a phase. Some are gender non-conforming. And some become boys.

You can subtly ask her *why* she likes all those things, but don't expect a consistent answer yet: sometimes being a girl just sucks and you want to escape it for a bit. Just support her in her choices and let her be herself. 

If you wish, you can gently introduce her to the various concept, but there is no need for anything more than a factual ""this is a thing that exists"" yet: some girls have blue hair, some kids have two dads, and some men were born as girls. There isn't anything ""good"" or ""brave"" or ""different"" about it, it is just part of the whole spectrum of humanity.

Over the next few years, let *your kid* tell you what she is. If she is trans and aware of the existence of trans people, she will definitely make it clear to you. It never hurts to be prepared for the *possibility*, but don't hyper-focus on just one possible option.
If you ask me, the most important part (aside from talking with them about it), is to just make sure they know that they are loved and supported no matter what. Aside from that, you two will figure it out together, and it won’t be as difficult or terrifying as it might seem
introduce the idea like ""do you know what transgender is?"" and explain it them if they dont or ask them to explain it to you if they do and then ask them if thats something they feel and if so decide if you want to put them on hormone blockers or not. if you want more info on hormone blockers and hormone therapy maybe talk to their doctor. i was the same way at 8 and i wish someone would have noticed the signs and did something about it.
Just let her do her thing. Lots of cis women go through this as children, and lots of trans men do as well. Maybe ask her questions like ""does your soul feel like a girl?"" or remind her that youll love her no matter who she decides to be. Never make her feel bad for expressing herself differently. Its incredible to see kids grow. And honestly? No matter what you do she's either trans or not trans. Its something you're born with, not something that develops. Best of luck!
I think your child will tell you whats best! Keep an open mind and an open heart to all outcomes and support your progeny as is asked of you in triumphs and the valleys between. Let your child know you're around unconditionally for support in whatever way you're asked to
My sister was very much the exact same as your child! Grew up only wanting short cropped hair, boys clothes, only close friends with boys, didn't like being referred to with feminine words and titles... my mom DID sit her down and gently ask if she felt like she wanted to be a boy when we were preteens, but my sis grew up and turned out to be a cis but very butch lesbian. (And I, the 'girly' ''sister'', turned out to be the trans one in the end, haha.)

If it's causing your child *distress* to be living as a girl, then I would recommend asking your child how they feel and only *then* looking into finding a trans-friendly child therapist. But if your child seems content to live as they currently are, as a masculine young girl, then I see no reason to not just live and let live for now. :] 

(But it's worth noting that even if cis, gender nonconforming children can still face transphobia and violence for how they present, so I commend you for being ready to protect your child.)
Sounds like things are going fine so far. Maybe ask them if they'd like to go by a different name or be referred to as a boy? That would be the next step I think.
I’d say just to show love and support as always and be patient. My mom was like that when she was younger and was a tomboy. Sometimes she wishes she could pee standing up but doesn’t hate being a woman and didn’t hate puberty. Again, patience. It could be a phase (unpopular opinion)
I would recommend letting them present how they want and if they ask to be referred to as a boy or by a different name or pronouns, trying to respect that. It’s good to let kids figure out what makes them feel comfortable, and presentation and stuff like that absolutely doesn’t have to be permanent depending on how the kid feels in the future. Thank you for talking to trans people about this and for trying to respect your kid. You’re doing great
Honestly the best thing you can do is support them whatever they want to do. And make sure they know that being trans is an option. Make sure they understand that you are a safe place for them to explore themselves without judgement and with full support
I think 8 is way too young to know whether she’s trans or not 

I don’t think it’s worth bringing up yet 

Just let her do what she wants
just let her be her as be supportive maybe she’s trans or maybe she’s just a tom boy who cares just support her
Now I was gonna just say ""start by letting them experiment with presentation."" And I still say that's important but the fact they said they wish they were a boy is very telling. Now while I didn't figure myself out until recently a lot of trans people know very early and your kid is old enough that it's likely. Sit them down. Ask if they want to start dressing more like a boy cutting their hair like a boy and being treated more like a boy. Maybe ask if they want your help choosing a boy name. If they already know who they are it can be harmful to wait. Note at this point I think the main thing is socialization at home. Let them wait a while before opening up at school. But ultimately it's their choice when they come out to friends. Now I'm not sure when a good time to start puberty blockers would be, if there's any doctors in your area that specialize in trans youth talk to them. Also if you know any trans adults they might have more suggestions. But don't wait on talking about this. Help them find their true self whether they're a boy, tomboy, or anyone else they may grow to be..
I’m not sure any of those things are signs of being trans. I mean it’s possible your child is trans but they are just going against society’s idea of gender norms. Going against gender roles doesn’t always equal transgender.
I wouldn't say anything directly. Just do things to show that it's a safe space for her if she does want to come out. Talk about people you may know who are LGBTQ or celebrities you like that are LGBTQ in a good light. If she does come out don't ask anything like ""are you sure"" ""god made you [x]"" ""this is just a phase"" ""you're too young"" etc. If she is trans this will help her feel safe enough to tell you
 Don’t push one way or the other. Let them decide. Be supportive.
let her find out. don’t pressure her into anything.  time will tell. she may be cis…. or not.
Listen to her and don't force her to be anything she is not. If she is trans or isn't trans, this is still your child and you love them. Trust me both of you will be happier if you allow her to decide how she expresses herself.

I am a 30 yo trans woman that wishes she could just have a conversation with her mother but she didn't make me feel like she would allow me to be me. Please just make it apparent that you will love your kid no matter their identity and things will likely be a-ok.
How about saying ""I will love you forever, no matter who you are or whatever you want to be, you can tell me anything""
I appreciate you for seeking advise on that - that's just not common - I'm really glad you're here. So, Welcome, first of all.   

Second of all: I'm a trans guy myself and I can tell you, that your child's behavior might be an indicator. MIGHT BE. I'm glad you recognized it though. It might mean nothing but curiosity, but it could be a sign of your child being trans. Stating they want to be a boy is rather strong. 

That being said: I felt like your daughter all my life, back when there was no one talking about trans. So I can confirm: it has nothing to do with the fact that trans is a known thing now. I felt like it, when there was nothing at all to back me. 

I think nowadays is a time you can confront your child more directly. Being trans isn't that exotic anymore - just like being gay. 

Even if your child isn't trans - just tell them about the possibility. That they might just become what they want to, that they might look like what they want to. That alone might give So much comfort.
Let her grow up and figure it out on her own. Continue to be supportive no matter what she does or does not say she is
You really shouldn’t lean one way or the other. Just make sure not to reinforce any particular stereotype for cis or trans and let them figure it out themselves. Even if you’re pretty sure kids are kids and like anything they really need to learn things for themselves
I'd keep things how they are for now unless she comes to you, and then you can test out things like a different name and pronouns to see if that's what she needs. Overall I'd just let her do whatever. She could also be a tomboy.
Best I can say is if they ever decide their gender identity is different, to just be ready and accept that for them. They may be anything, or it may even change! Best thing is to be there and let them be themself ^^ 

I know when I was that young I had no knowledge of what transgender was, and most of them were vilified, so sadly I didnt think it was a possibility. It scared me off from boy clothes and my preferred expression. But when I got older and started to learn, things started to make sense. But as kids were also growing and changing, and things come and go as we decide and try things out :)
i started doing the same thing around when i was about 7 or 8. over time i decided i wasn’t a female and now that i’m 18, i have started to medically transition. also, my sisters best friend growing up knew he was trans since 3rd grade. went by preferred name, wore boys clothes, didn’t want to be called a girl, etc. now he’s in high school and knows 100% he’s trans. i would say go along with it but don’t start any medical or surgical transitions until they’re more mature to make that decision because once you start you can’t go back. i think they’re so lucky to having a loving and caring parent like you. you’re truly amazing, and it’s needed in this situation.
While the sings were defiantly there for me when I was younger and wish I got into it earlier I don’t recommend doing anything or making any assumptions I’d just talk to them about the vague concepts but not ask them specifically if they are
Kinda watch how it plays out, I was like this and although I am Transgender this doesn’t always mean that. It could be they feel comfortable expressing themself with you this much and might be a Tom boy but due to society think boy. Or they could be transgender. Either way it already seems like you’re an amazing and supportive parent, just keep doing that and you’ll both eventually figure it out!
Why not ask him if he likes being called by that pronoun? You'll be amazed at how fully formed an 8-year-old is, no matter the lack of vocabulary.
You probably want to make her feel like she’s valid, so buying her boy clothes, getting boy toys, that stuff, but be discreet as she probably doesn’t know what transgender is
She might end up being trans, she might not. For now just listen to her about what she wants, let her make her own choices about clothes and hair. Obviously it's too early to be thinking about any kind of medical intervention, so for now you have a few years where you can just let her breathe. If she wants to change name/pronouns, support her. If she's happy with where she's at now, let it be. As long as you keep your full support behind her and don't react poorly when she confides in you, she should come to you about it as she figures herself out.
I was like your child. I thought I was a tomboy, and then a broken woman, and then a trans man, and again a broken woman (being a full man was too masculine and too “much” for me), and then I discovered that you could be non-binary. I used to ask for a “willy” for Christmas, stand up to pee, and wish I was a boy all the time. Looking back, I just knew I definitely wasn’t a girl and thought my only other option was being a boy. I now have short masculine hair, have top surgery coming up in less than a month, present very masculine and identify as transmasculine non-binary with the title of Mx/Mr if Mx isn’t an option.

I do have a twin brother (I am AFAB) and this could have contributed to who I am today in many ways. I also went through around a year of over-performing stereotypically female behaviour around the age of 12-13 (short skirts, make-up, push-up and padded bras etc). Apparently this is common in trans men/AFAM androgynous and masc-presenting non-binary people so if your child does this it might mean this but it might also mean something else.

I guess just talk to your child and tell them you’ll support them no matter what, tell them their options and that just because they were AFAB they don’t have to be a girl. Remind them you’ll love them regardless and I’m sure they’ll come to you in their own time. 

Good luck! I wish my parents were like you. Sending you all my best.
When reading this, I was like ""Yeah, maybe she's just a tomboy.""

But when I read ""she wishes she was a boy"" - that's it. That's just the only sign you need. Even if your child wouldn't be masculine, but just said ""I want to be a boy"", that's all you need to know - to know that at very least - they are questioning.

&#x200B;

Should you wait untill hormones? - maybe (not too much until your child starts changing from the wrong puberty - that can be the worst). But you should at least talk to them. Trans people can know their gender identity by that age, so if they said that they want to be a boy, they are probably pretty sure... So, talking about it with them and social transitioning (preferred pronouns and name), would be what would help to show them that they are loved, and that they don't need to be scared nor to come out nor to start transitioning (if they don't feel ready). But with the transitioning part - they will need your help and support. So give it to them! Please, give it - don't make mistakes, and talk about it as soon as possible (nothing else, just talking - and depending on their feelings, they should start transitioning, but you still may not be 100% sure).

&#x200B;

Edit: So, at the very least, you should have conversation with your child. Even if they are not trans, conversation nor puberty blockers won't hurt them. Whereas going through the wrong puberty is what causes our suicide rates. If they go on puberty blockers, it's totally reversable - and even after knowing they are not trans, they can get off them and start their biological puberty. Whereas, if they'll know they are trans, without puberty blockers - they will have to go through their wrong, biological puberty - and that can lead to dysphoria, anxiety and deppression.
There’s a YouTube channel called “queer kid stuff” and they do a pretty good job explaining lgbtq topics and things like pronouns, gender identity and gender expression 

It’s all in cute short videos made for young children
Don't make assumptions but let them know it's safe to be who they are, maybe take your kid to a pride event or somehow show support of trans people
I think just let them dress how they want, they could be trans, they could not be, I don’t think there’s anything wrong with letting them cut their hair and wear “boy clothes”. I’d talk to them about trans people, just to let them know that we exist, either they turn out to be trans or they don’t, but listen to them whatever they turn out to be.
Wait till 14 for any permanent changes. Don't forcee her into anything though except for appropriate clothing because everyone is responsible for how they look.
Genuinely even as a trans man myself, I don't believe that a child under 15 should have to pick if they want to be a boy or girl (with medication or procedures). Of course even if your child does end up being trans it can wait until they know that is what they want. I've shown signs of being trans since I was a kid too and I didn't fully know or realize I was trans until this year when I'm 23. If your child is going to transition let them do so on their own time and just make sure to always show that you're there to support them.  Let them dress the way they choose (especially at 8yo)
It doesn't necessary mean that they're transgender. I'm not an expert by any means, but I'd suggest you both to take your time to figure it out. Try social (non-medical) transition and/or puberty blockers to see if it seems more comfortable to them. That way your child can detransition back to girl if they change their mind, or continue the transition at 16-18+ years, if they are 100% sure that yes, they are a transgender.

My point is that it's better to leave opportunities for both ways, and to not make any irreversible decisions just yet.

Talking to a psychiatrist (not to be confused with a psychologist) is also higly recommended.

And yes, huge respect for accepting your child the way they are, instead of rejecting them. Many children need parents like you. 🤍
Sounds like me as a child!
For me what happened next was: I started trying to get kids at school to treat me like a boy - then I got bullied, parents tried to make me a girl, did all girl boarding school etc etc - 10 years later and I finally have the language to realise I am nonbinary

My advice is to just listen and take each thing at a time: they want a hair cut? Do it! They want to try different clothes? Let em! Letting them explore allows them to see what feels comfortable. Just be there and let them know you love them for them.
(Using they/them as neutral singular for your child in case you get confused, I know I do sometimes and I'm trans myself lol)

Let your kid explore themself, they could be a tomboyish girl or a trans man. ""Wishing to be a boy"" is a common sign for trans people but you shouldn't jump to conclusions yet, since your child is still really young, jumping to conclusions sometimes leads to regret, just let them know that you'll love them no matter what. You could talk to your child about it when they're a bit older if they still do the same things, around the start of puberty could work, it's when children really start exploring themselves, after that, seek therapy and see how it goes from there.

Hope this helped in some way
just be accepting and give them time
I think just leave her to explore really, that’s the best idea. Rushing in any direction might make it a bit harder for them to understand how they feel, so just let them explore and see how things work. If they wanna try “boy” clothes, let them, if they don’t, that’s fine too. It really is probably the best way to go about it - let them see what they like and explore how they feel. 

TL;DR As long as your child feels they can talk to you if they need something, leaving them to explore on their own is the best option currently.
Just let her be her, and if she requests a change of being addressed or a different name then use it, the thing is even if it is a phase then let her experiment, the beauty of being a child is being able to be unapologetically yourself and to experiment and learn who you are. Maybe talk with her on her feelings of wanting to be a boy and whether she wants to be called he or have a different name. I wish you the best of luck, and you will not lose your child by them deciding what is best for them. I know when I was that age it was isolating to not be able to voice those feelings and to not be able to express myself, I am a trans guy now and living my best life, I just wish I had known and been able to be myself sooner.
If I were in your position, I’d talk to her now with the aim of just learning more about how she feels. You don’t need to educate her on everything about trans people right away (although you should help her find that stuff out if she’s interested) but you should learn a few things if you can:

* what pronouns does your child want you to use for them?

* how does your child want to dress?

* when your child imagines themselves as a grownup, what do they see?

* does your child prefer being called a “girl” or a “boy” or a “person”? Or something else?

Bear in mind that your child is literally 8 so it’s very likely that they’ll change as time goes on. Maybe when they’re a teenager they’ll be a trans man, or maybe they’ll be a cis teenage girl. As a parent, you get to be there while your child figures out who they are. Your only role is to listen and facilitate their flourishing into the person they’re meant to be.
...let your kid wear short hair, boy clothes, check in with them if they want to go by different pronouns or do anything about their name or nicknames. It's as simple as that. Just tell your child they can explore whether they're a boy or a girl or an enby and you're always gonna be there to support them. It's not any more complicated than that at this stage.
It’s most likely just a phase. Trying to be cool etc. I would just wait for it to blow over.
Let your child *explore""! Don't worry about what any interest they have 'means' and let them enjoy and expand the gift of curiosity. Set necessary boundaries for their safety and your budget, but not based on restrictive gender binaries. Most of all, share your loves and passions and let your child see how curiosity can lead to interest and how that can lead to something meaningful in their life. 🥰
If I were you. I would teach her what trans is and be clear that you are fully supportive of the trans community and if one day any of your children were to come out as trans you would be 100% supportive. This will give her some of the tools she needs to figure it out and tell her that you are a safe place to talk about this stuff. Even just little passing comments. When trans people come on Tv talk about how awesome it is that they get to be their authentic selves. It’s almost less important that she figures it out right now and way more important that she knows that you are safe no matter what.
At this age it natural to experiment with what is more comfortable for you.
Just let her do what she want, she might be cis or she might be trans - she'll figure it out with time. Just be there for her and show her there's no need to hide her true self from you - no matter who it is.
Basically just let her be herself and create a safe space for her to express herself however she wants. Whatever way you wanna let her know that you'll support her if she turns out to be trans. Just let he rbe free to explore these things on her own and just be supportive wherever the road takes her :)
Just let your child be who they are and you’ll see, they is maybe too young to know
They’ll find out just let it go
I would say let your kid dress and act how they want to. Refer to them how they want to be referred to. If they do turn out to be trans and you repress this, they’ll be traumatised from it (literally.) If they don’t, well, no harm will come of it and they will have at least tried it out. At this age, there isn’t anything permanent that can be done in terms of transitioning - it’s not like your kid is suddenly going to be forced onto hormones and into surgery by their teachers and/or doctors or anything.
Try to talk with her.
I had the same behavior when I was her age but my mother would say that it was normal. I felt bad for years until I understand that I was really trans.
Just love them ❤️.  Developmentally at 8 children often focus more on their friends and social circles so if your child is spending time with male friends this could be a ""tomboy"" phase as opposed to signs they are trans. Having said that you could be totally right that these are early signs and just reiterating that your child is loved and accepted for who they are and choose to be will leave them hopefully feeling open to come talk to you if needed. I work with children from 4 to 12 and keeping the lines of communication open is one of the most Important things I've found. Also you can totally have a conversation about it (I have had similar discussions with as young as kindergarten kids) just be mindful of the language you use. It's a confusing time for kids even without gender issues so try not to direct them as opposed to just.making them comfortable to express how they feel. Aka ""I've noticed your style is changing a bit do you like how these clothes feel better?"" As opposed to ""I've noticed you're dressing like a boy, do you want to buy boy clothes now?""
Well, you can show her that you are supportive and caring
When your child is older they will probably tell you about it.
I would never tell my parents because neither of them are supportive
if she said that she wishes to be a boy... maybe it's anything, but I would talk with her and show her that, if she wants, she can be a boy for a while or forever. experimenting with gender is healthy, or, at least, knowing that you can discuss it with your mom freely.
Children usually have a good grasp of gender by the time they are 4. It's worth keeping the discussion open, letting them know if they bring it up again that it's an option they can try (personally and socially) etc.

Leave room to explore! Some kids are just tomboys, but some feel more deeply about the subject. And from my own experience, the healthier their environment is the sooner they will have room to understand who they are.
Tell your kid now. Also research and inform them about nonbinary genders. my parents are very supportive of me being nonbinary/trans, but i would have really appreciated it if i had learned about those things sooner. even if your kid isnt trans, still educate them (and yourself) about how to be a good ally. Best of luck!
I would say just talk to them about it, because as someone who is older and came out recently I wish that if I realized earlier I would be so much happier. So maybe if you can help point them in the correct direction that they actually want it could help them later. And it really does no harm I had the ""the talk"" when I was nine and it actually helped me later. So using the same analogy I'd do it. (P.S. sorry for sounding like a broken record a bit)
just let them be them. give them the short hair and clothes they want. there’s not a whole lot you can do at this age other than support the decisions they make about their presentation. if you wanted to go above and beyond, maybe bring up the concept of transitioning in a light hearted way. ex. “you know, I have a friend who’s a lot like you. he grew up as a girl but he feels a lot happier how he is now” “i was watching a show the other day that had a character that changed their gender. i think it’s so cool that more people are accepting of our differences nowadays” “have you ever thought about what it’s like to be a boy? sometimes i think i’d like to be a girl. there are a lot of people out there who decide to act on that thought. what do you think about that?”
I am not a parent but I do have experience being a child, and I identify with the story you tell about your child, and the best suggestion I can give you is to pay attention to how they expresses theyself and let they be, for now they are just children so there is nothing wrong with  preferring some clothes or games than others. And don't be afraid to investigate and inform you, her and your loved ones, that there is more than just one gender expression and personality, (not because we have been raised with a life projection that must be hetero-white-cis-normative because this is supposed to be normal, it must be the same for the future generations that are already here, growing up). So... back to the point, at some point she's going to figure out what she likes, how she identifies, what she prefers. Provide they with information and a safe space to be authentic so that they journey to self-knowledge is one of joy rather than anguish, secrets and questions. Blessings and greetings, I am a 25 year old trans man who lived 18 years wondering who I am and why I am here if I don't find meaning in my existence, for not having information that men like me exist.
She's a girl, raise her as a girl. Society has put so much confusion in our minds, but it's not that hard. There are short haired, rough, tom-boy like girls. No need to subject them to changing themselves to ""fit in"" with a certain image. Let them be. Let them grow. Stop overthinking. She is a girl, no matter what her mind is saying, treat her as one.
So what she's only being a tomboy
Let the fucking child enjoy his childhood and not label him
My mum was so traditional that she removed all my button shirts and jeans and replaced em with tight “girly” shirts and skirts. It was a hell to be honest. In my nightmares 25years later i still hear her schreems;”i have 3 sons and 2 daughters!!” 
And i had to cook, clean, tske care of my younger siblings while my two brothers were outside having proper fun.
This but I’d add make sure to let her know you’ll love her no matter what and it’s ok to love who you want or be who you want.
The only time my mom ever hit me during my childhood, was once when I was refusing to wear a dress. You never forget those things. (and turns out, I'm trans)
This.
[removed]
Yep best bet is 1) just show her through your actions and the way you discuss situations and trans people that you won’t be a threat to her if she ever comes out and 2) just respect her wishes. She will figure herself out on her own time, trust me. Just make her feel comfortable and loved for who she is, no matter what.
Seconding this. Don't make it a huge deal, but let her know that she allowed to try out different clothing and names and social things. Do your research, and educate her a little at a time at an age-appropriate kevel.

You never know where the kid will end up. If they're cis, they had a fun little phase. If they're anything else, you gave them the blessing of a lifetime, one many of us never got: the love and acceptance of her parents.
Hello, genuine question: why is it bad to ask if she feels like she’s a boy?
Yes, this! Your child is going to learn from your example so the more conversant you are in gender ideas, the more naturally your child will pick them up.
that’s not transphobic it’s facts
If you note, most trans people are saying this too

Adult trans folks are the last people who will insist transness on any kid. We know enough about gender to know it's bullshit, and that exploration is to be encouraged, not transition. Transition is something each person has to decide for themselves, when they figure out their gender by themselves.
Your right.. I didn't think of that
I wouldn’t question her either. Just if she tells you she wished she was a boy, or similar statements, you may incite her to develop, but without emiting any jugement, opinion nor orientate the exchange. If later on any stronger questionning comes to her mind, she would be more confident she can mention it to you.
You may consult a specialised psy yourself if you feel you need it, but otherwise, just stay open, observing and ready to listen. They are also children comics that may show her that she is not an exception, other children may have felt it.

Keep this wonderful attention and openness, without worrying. This is what all of us wished from our parents.
At that age I don’t know if asking about pronouns makes the most sense. Maybe, like, asking if they’d liked to be referred to as a boy or maybe just using gender neutral language.
[deleted]
just say them
One slight edit to this I’d suggest is at least to start to go for a nickname that makes sense for their given name if possible, like Jaz or something
[removed]
Maybe I'll journal these signs and bring her to a therapist
Oh yeah, just don’t rush them to make a decision in a way that they think it is a permanent feeling.
Yeah, wait until they are in immense pain and stress for the rest of their life, sure.
I wouldn't recommend that, i waited to come out after puberty and now I have a zero percent chance of ever passing
..that’s what happened to me. That’s a horrible idea

At least introduce the concept. Don’t tell them anything about themselves
Dont you think 'your kid is trans' just because they are slightly gender non conforming is a bit.....pushy.

Basically what you are saying is 'girls have to be feminine, pretty, have friend that are girls, play with folls and have long hair, and if they don't then they aren't really a girl'

Isn't that kind of....enforcing gender stereotypes??
i also think having a conversation with them about how they want to be perceived would be a good idea. let them know that if they ever want to be recognized differently that you’ll be supportive and do your best to adapt
Christ I'm so sorry....that is not okay :(
Please, it's okay to have fun but ***this is not the time or thread for that***
I’m not op of course but I am gendersomething, and I honestly think that question is too abstract for an 8 year old to answer. Kids who know they are trans that young may say that without being prompted, but I feel like asking a young child to answer that would be giving her too much to think on. She’s still exploring after all
She might not be ready to have that conversation if she is a boy/nonbinary or if she is cis, then she may be hurt by the implication that she is ""not a real girl"". 

It is better for both cases to allow the kid to have room to figure it out and bring it up themselves.
The question is restrictive - it assumes a gender binary and that all 'boys' feel one way and all 'girls' feel another. At this age, I think it's better to provide examples of happy, successful people of all genders who have lots of different feelings about things so the child sees all feelings are valid.
I knew at that age and much younger I’d rather be called a kid than a daughter. Regardless, there’s no harm in offering the option. They can choose to try a different pronoun and find it’s a better fit for them, they can try a different pronoun and find they don’t prefer it, they can choose to not try a different pronoun then think about it and later decide they want to try a different one, they can give it some thought and never try a different pronoun. Who cares?
1) not a bro.

2)Why in the fuck do you think that list of things was fucking for? At no point in any of did I say to assume the kid was trans, but to make sure that IF THEY ARE, they have the tools available to make sure they get to live the life they want. Ask IF they want to go by a different name. Make sure they have the terminology IF they need to have that conversation. Be supportive in their decisions (which should just be basic parenting anyway) so that IF they need to have that conversation, they know their parents are a safe place. Do research into a good doctor and therapist IN CASE that conversation happens. Only broach the topic yourself at the start of puberty IF they haven't talked to you already (which 2-4 years away) to be sure their child has the best life possible. None of that is going to hurt the kid if they are cis, but not doing any of that could DEFINITELY hurt them if they are trans.

3) having Gender dysphoria is not the defining thing in being trans but saying ""I wish I was a different gender"" KIND OF IS!!!
let her be herself and don’t push being trans onto her. i’m not saying there’s no chance but she’s only 8 years old, she doesn’t need to go to a therapist for liking boy things. don’t rush it. my sister is trans and she didn’t fully realize it until she was in 8th grade so give her time to figure herself out even if she says she wants to be a boy because that doesn’t mean she’s trans, she may just like the idea of being a boy. those are different things. if you push an identity onto her it will confuse her, she has to figure it out for herself as time goes by. answers are not needed at 8 years old, see how she feels when she’s older after starting puberty instead of elementary school.
Therapist is not necessary
Or tolerate their behaviour, dont encourage but dont punish... Wait until they are older, at least been through puberty, so they're sure they want to make such a huge irreversible change...

Or just be you and wag your finger in the parents face all self-righteous like and tell them their 8 year old kid is trans and to act now because they'll be a terrible parent cause you know their 8y/o will be in 'immense pain and stress' for the rest of their life, as a result of the parents not approving an irreversible change.
This isn't being said to the concerned parent of an 8y/o child, no, this is an opportunity to talk down to someone and act like you're hard done by eww
Ah true but I’m kinda in denial rn and also im high
Thank you for your reply :)
Thank you for responding.
Thank you, I can see how this non binary aspect is important for kids to be aware of.
[deleted]
Nothing at 8 years old is irreversible, do some research before you spout bullshit that could impact someone's life. Honestly...
You're welcome, I wish I had understood more as a father when I was younger, maybe if I had the courage to ask more questions like you, I would have. 🥰👍
1) you could check my bio?

2) If I say ""I slept with one of my bros last might"" you wouldn't exactly picture me in bed with a Victoria's secret model. So no, it's not.

3) what I said isn't wrong. Their kid saying ""I wish I was a different gender"" is a strong sign that they want to be a different gender. (Shocker I know).

4) No. It literally isn't. There are plenty of trans people who have never experienced gender dysphoria.
🤗
[deleted]
1) the fact you're trying to argue this instead of simply apologizing for using an honorific that I don't like speaks loads about how you feel about me and this community.

2) you don't think I don't know that tomboys are a thing? What you think i'm trans I make that my entire identity and completely ignore the rest of the GSRM community? You don't I know what ""dykes on bikes"" butch lesbians and gym gays are? And that's completely ignoring my personal experience of growing up in a traditionalist, conservative, religious, non-supportive, highly restictive family with 3 sisters, one of whom was a tomboy and she grew up to be one of the most badass women you'll never get the honor of meeting. I know the difference between a tomboy, a butch lesbian, and a trans guy. I know the difference between a femboy, a twink, and a trans girl.

3) it makes plenty of sense. While being gender-noncorming doesn't make you trans, saying ""I wish I wasn't my gender assigned at birth"" is a pretty good indicator that you are. Trans is simply not identifing with you AGAB. Unfortunately, while I can try explaining that to you, I can't understand it for you.

4) Again, that point is entirely moot. As I have already agreed with it and shown how all my advice given affirms that stance. Again, none of the advice I gave with hurt the kid if they turn out cis, but not doing it will definitely hurt them if they turn out trans.
[deleted]
1) congrats. You're a dick.

2) again, literally raised with a tomboy. You're not telling me something I don't already know and something I have already taken into account in giving my advice.

3) you... You do know that's what the puberty blockers and therapist is for... Right? Like, puberty blockers have no long term effects on the body. It's a fucking pause button. So that the kid and their therapist can sort out if they're trans over ~5 years. Again, everything I said isn't going to hurt a cis person. Even IF they end up on puberty blockers and go to a therapist and decide they aren't trans after all after 3,4 or even 5 years on puberty blockers, you know what happens? They get taken off puberty blockers, and go through their normal, biological puberty. Almost like I KNOW WHAT I'M TALKING ABOUT.

Why do some people find masculine people wearing feminine clothes funny?	"Like my mom finds it hilarious when I wear even just nail polish?! Like what the fuck is funny about it? 

Edit: thanks guys for the discussion! I think this was a very helpful experience for me and hopefully other people!"	"Many of us live in cultures that devalue and degrade femininity inherently, even if people like to pretend otherwise. You can see it in the way people treat a woman dressing masculine as aspirational, but a man dressing feminine as ridiculous. They see femininity as an object to be consumed, and men as consumers. The same misogyny bleeds into homophobia when they find the idea of a gay man funny, and into transphobia when they see trans women as funny just for being trans.
Transmisogyny and transphobia. If they can make it a joke then they can hide their dislike and fear of divergence from the norm behind humor while simultaneously shaming trans people out of being themselves and making it feel like no one takes trans people seriously. Also just people get giggly about things they see as tabboo.
Years of conditioning.
Literally every media representation of trans people until 5ish years ago was trans people are point of ridicule.

Watch the Netflix documentary Disclosure as it gives many examples of how much society was fed these values through media.

I've been watching Friends because I never let myself watch it when I was younger (my older brother didn't like it so I pretended the same - though I wanted to be Phoebe)... Literally every second episode there's a queer slur, and so many trans ones. Brad Pitts cameo results in an intersex slur, Chandler's Dad is trans and it is a point of ridicule everytime it's mentioned.

Remember that friends was just considered a friendly easy watching comedy. If you're constantly fed this shit without the experience or knowledge to question it, you think it's normal and acceptable behaviour.
No idea, i think its cute/hot
Transphobia
Sexism and transphobia
I honestly don't know I never found that stuff funny at all.

Like I went to a hypnotist comedian once and part of his show was to get two guys on stage and have them act like lesbian lovers. I just sat there very confused about what was funny.

I left the show with a bad taste in my mouth from how crass it all was but wondered more about why the audience had found it so funny because some people were literally howling with laughter.

I'm glad that I didn't go up on stage, even though I thought being hypnotized looked fun because I'm pretty sure no one would have taken my transition seriously or the fact that I'm a trans lesbian seriously if I did.
the same reasons they use girl as an insult
From what I've seen, for people who don't understand gender a trans man is a...""woman"" wearing men's clothes  (Ugh I hate even saying it) and a trans woman is a guy wearing women's clothes. I've heard trans men have an easier time while transitioning and not passing bc cis people can rationalize a ""tomboy"", but they can't rationalize trans women. To them, it seems like someone on top of the social ladder stepping down for no reason they understand, and without any concept of gender, that hits uncanny valley levels of confusion and distrust.
Hegemony
So I work at the front door at Walmart lol not the best job for being trans but I noticed this too it’s so annoying I literally get laughed at all day it’s got to the point we’re I just don’t talk to anyone unless I have too my voice is usually what clocks me after I stopped talking it helped a lot but I know exactly how you feel. If she’s understanding about things I’d definitely voice that it hurts your feelings And see what happens. But if they don’t understand I’m sure if you just continue as yourself it will stop eventually.
I mean, I could launch a tirade about how humanity has been socially conditioned to fulfil breeding roles in order to provide bodies for armies; utilising gender roles, shame and sexualisation to enforce it.

Anything outside of those gender roles is looked down upon because subconscious programming is telling these breeders that you are not fulfilling your assigned role.
Its transphobia and misogyny
In addition to all the very valid and true cultural things people have said already, there's also the fact that most men who wear feminine clothes are wearing off-the-rack, untailored clothes that don't fit or flatter them, and it looks off.
Misogyny and homophobia
I'd say its cute.
They got small brains
As a transfemme, I wear femme cloths just to stick it to them. \*But\* Leggings and a Skirt with a baggy tee = my vibe
i laugh at literally anything when i am nervous or uncomfortable .  maybe she's just uncomfortable and doesn't know how to properly react?  i would definitely ask about it
cute
A combination of the deeply ingrained delusion of ""man good, woman bad"" combined with the fact that the definition of ""man"" and ""manly"" is insanely narrow. It's already evident from how widely accepted tomboys are, as opposed to how taboo femboys are, but that's still just scratching at the surface of the consequences of centuries, if not milennia of bigotry...
Laughter is sometimes a response to confusion.
Because transphobia and misogyny are joined at the hip
She laughs to validate her fragile femininity
I’m really sorry you’re dealing with that. I’m a feminine trans man/enby, and my dad was fine with my transition until I grew my hair out again + started wearing eyeshadow/nail polish and now he has to make a “joke” every. single. time.

“I thought you wanted to be a guy?” or *looks me up and down* “Huh..” (weird smile as if he’s about to say something HILARIOUS). Anything to make him seem like a comedian and me seem inferior. He acts like he’s just joking but it’s just another way for him to spread toxic values without having to take accountability. He likes to gaslight people a lot.

People like this are often trying to hide how insecure and small they themselves feel, in my experience. In a disgusting way. Fuck what they think, we’re the ones who are truly trying to be ourselves, and that’s something powerful.
Giving your mom way more benefit of the doubt than she might deserve, people who study the neuroscience of humor have found one of the most common triggers of humor is unexpected juxtapositions.  Transgender behavior hasn't been normalized in culture enough and so people see it as unexpected.  This effect is probably increased when you've known someone for a long time and mostly knew them a certain way.
It's not laughing out of humor alot of the time: it's laughing out of discomfort. They laugh so they don't have to feel uncomfortable and to ""regain power"" over a situation that confuses or scares them :/
Same
Right now, the world says that when a girl wants to play sports, dress however they want, not wear make up, people say “wow! good for her ignoring stereotypes! I bet you she will become the first female president one day!”

But, when a guy does the same thing, wears clothes that are against the stereotype, put on makeup, paint their nails, want to play with dolls instead of superhero’s, suddenly the f slur is thrown at them, and people get hysterical saying  how they’re trying to get rid of “real men” and “I can’t believe this is what the world has come to.”

Why the double standard? I really wish I knew because it is stupid as fuck, and hearing that shit as a child, especially from family, fucked me up.
Because many people think feminity is something that others should be ashamed off, I even once saw a guy use the word ""feminine"" as an insult, really sexist :/
Long story short: homophobia and misogyny
Blame the tv industry who have had mocking people like us. 😩
I don't know, but for some reason it's a staple of British humor. Probably why the UK is so transphobic.
When you distill humor down to it's most essential elements, you'll find that there are only a few basic components.  One of them is subversion of expectation.  This is why it is funny when the Black Knight gets his arm lopped off.  The expectation is a response of pain, fury, or perhaps terror.  Instead, the knight tries to pretend that it didn't happen.  When he loses the other arm and persists, and then does the same as he loses his legs, we are given a new expectation:  that he will somehow attempt to carry on.  Instead, he declares that the match is a draw.

Nail polish is commonly strongly associated with femininity.  When a masculine individual wears it, you have the same subversion of expectation that you commonly see in jokes.  In the prototypical form - simply observing the subversion - it isn't all that funny.  Of course one can bolt all sorts of extra things onto it in the privacy of their own head and turn it into something that makes them laugh.

That covers the *how*, so that leaves only the why.  If the joke isn't shared with the polish-wearer - or if it isn't appreciated or funny - then it is being done at the expense of the person with painted nails.  Someone who makes a habit of finding humor at the expense of someone else is thoughtless at best, and being hateful at worst.  The why, therefore, is likely to be some flavor of phobia or bias being used to justify treating someone else as lesser, as a target for mockery.
Years and years of conditioning
Fantastic insight.
It depends on the context. In some cases it can be a subversion of expectations, as is the case with Monty Python's lumberjack song.

The joke is less that it's masculine person with femine dress habits, and more that a hyper masculine stereotype of a person mid song goes from singing about cutting down trees to talking about wearing frilly dresses.

Monty Python's style of humor is very heavily reliant in subversion of expectations, from banging coconuts together as horses in a king Arthur story to the ""dirty fork"" sketch.

In other cases, it's used as a gross out shock value kind of thing such as in ace ventura. 

Still in other times the comedy is reliant upon using the masculine person in women's clothes as a vehicle to get an obviously straight man to get into an awkward situation where they mistakenly hit one someone they are *not* attracted to, and the humor comes from watching the awkwardness.

In basically all cases though it basically uses the fact that a masculine person in women's clothes is *very* taboo and abnormal to make the setup work, which is sort of the real crux of the issue.
Well...many feminine clothes are mainly made for skinny arms, a short wingspan and so on. So seeing someone for example using a dress and having maybe not huge, but a little muscular arms seems odd and kind of funny. Just like seeing a dog wearing a pair of jeans. Just not what you would be expecting, right?
People just simply like to laugh at what's different.
I think Billy Porter said it best, so I'm just going to link to him. https://fb.watch/aECVYMDuSl/
I, to my shame, found it funny growing up in the 90s and early 2000s. Part of why it's been so hard admitting I'm trans ID how transphobic growing up was. I remember several plot lines of different shows basically had whole episodes dedicated to trans or cross dressers, and the punch line was someone being transphobic (looking at you, Friends)

Not the most healthy way to be brought up thinking about trans people, but I'm thankful it's only been institutionalised, passive transphobia and not direct, active, hostile transphobia that I grew up around.

As to why I found it funny? Probably because I was laughing along with the crowd, or that it was so unexpected in context to see a man wearing feminine clothing that it looked out of place enough to be humorous.
Watch disclosure on Netflix.
Idk it’s a British thing. I’m trans and I still find it funny in the right context.
This song touches this topic but with a “I don’t give a **** attitude…. https://youtu.be/d5bFsOVxMpU
Beautifully said
That sounds right to me 😕

And look at the people who would find it “funny”. 

The concept of it being “funny” is bizarre to me.
That is very true. I mean the same can be said for literally everything that isn’t normal. It’s like a cop out from actually having to try and understand people.
this. it’s why people are so insistent that “it’s just comedy” so they can continue to mock and degrade trans people
I feel like most of the time those kinds of jokes more so hinge on the fact that the person wearing the clothes is either embarrassed or uncomfortable and/or that the clothes are ill-fitted, rather than from anywhere dark

God, rewatching Friends as I got queerer really made it age poorly for me. I know it's a sign of the time, but damn, would it have killed cishet writers to not make trans and GNC people the butt of a cruel joke so often?? I remember an AWFUL episode of the IT crowd where the entire thing was about a trans woman and it's just...I won't go into it, it's bad. The writer is an openly transphobic horrible piece of stale moldy wonderbread, so it's not surprising.
BRO SAME!!!
Ha maybe so
More or less
Jesus Christ. That actually sounds like a living nightmare personally
Pretty sure that's all fake anyway.  Audience plants are common, after all.
Truuuuuueee!
AW that’s really cute! But yes I love me some skirts!!! And sweeter combined
Yeah I don’t know why people few feminism is a inherently bad thing
Yes very much so, thanks for sharing. But yeah that’s why I’m kinda not going to both in trying to come out to my mom. Mostly because she still doesn’t understand what trans even is. Even though I explained it to her 5 times.
Yeah I just didn’t give enough context fist about the stuff with my mom. I mean I don’t really want to share thaaaaaat much. And there isn’t really that much to go off of. Mostly because my mom wouldn’t really except it
Yeah especially sense people use the phase “your acting like a girl” as an insult
Basically what it all boils down to
All shitty jokes about men being feminine are about subverting expectations though.  ""Ha ha, isn't it funny that the man is doing the woman thing?""  All you have to do is take one look at how the pythons have responded to trans people recently to know that they were approaching this humor in exactly the same way as their peers.
Exactly
Not everybody is equipped/ready to have their precious veil of ""normal"" ripped away.  Not defending them, just saying.  The best I can do is not give a fuck about strangers and openly challenge the ignorance of those who are in my immediate world bubble.  It sucks a lot at first, but over the years, I've learned that most of my issue is not that their opinions are important, but that they may somehow validate my own insecurities derived from many things, including trauma.  Once I learned that I was looking for shame, it became so much easier to stop doing it.
One of my biggest revelations was that normal≠good and abnormal≠bad. Just like in maths, where the value of ""normal"" depends on the data being processed, defining a ""normal"" lifestyle depends on what points of reference are available. Ie. a bigot sees a man wearing a dress, and decides it's ""abnormal"" simply because it's something they haven't seen often, or something they're seeing for the first time.
Yep. Same as people laughing at guys with long hair or women with short hair a couple decades ago. Or the people that would mock the way punk rockers dressed back in the day. Usually they were just masking fear with mocking hoping to gather other like minded normal herd members around them to feel safe. You can tell by turning suddenly on a stranger in public when they do it and getting right up in their face about it. They might rally after a second or two but that initial look in their eye? That’s pure pants pissing fear. It’s an important distinction because while it is hatred it’s hatred born of fear. There’s a difference.
YEAH I KNOW, even though that makes like 0 sense. Like there isn’t anything to get at through Trans people. It’s literally just their existence that makes them funny
yeah, but that's not all the jokes, and even so, doesn't ""man is FORCED against his will to be in feminine clothes and is uncomfortable, because why would a man ever WANT to be feminine?"" or sound a bit iffy?

plus, imagine a woman wearing an oversized men's shirt. It doesn't fit her, but I doubt that many of the people who laugh at ""men in dresses"" joke would find it as funny
It's misogyny because it's hatred toward femininity.  Misogynistic cultures see masculinity as aspirational and femininity as degrading; that's why they see a masculine person in a dress as funny. It's not really misandry because it's founded in the expectation that everyone should *want* to be masculine.
Check out the book Whipping Girl, it covers a lot of this and is generally pretty good.
People mocking those they perceive as masculine or men for doing or wearing feminine things can be considered a kind of or to stem from transmisogyny because the primary targets or butt of the joke is transfeminine folks. Transmisogyny is not quite the same as just misogyny, I said ""transmisogyny and transphobia"" instead of ""misogyny and transphobia"" for a reason. Transmisogyny is how transphobia and misogyny intersect in a specific way that particularly harms transfeminine folks, who are most often the target of hatred towards feminine expression by someone assumed to be male. It's not quite just the combination of the two, but also in some ways its own beast entirely. 

The fact that people find a masculine person wearing nailpolish funny relates to transmisogyny because lot of the social conditioning to find that funny comes from the numerous transphobic and transmisogynistic jokes made about or at the expense of trans women in media. Hatred of transfeminine people spawns transphobic and transmisogynistic 'men in dresses' and similar jokes at their expense in media, and those portrayals in media creates and/or reinforces the idea that a (percieved/assumed) 'man' doing feminine things is something to laugh at or ridicule.
I can see it. The feminine is the ""lesser,"" so the dominant adopting those traits is ""funny."" (Trying to describe the mindset not stating objective facts, obvi.) But to hold the feminine as ""lesser"" is itself naturally misogynistic...
Transmisogyny ultimately hurts trans women the most, no doubt, but anyone can experience transmisogyny. For example, when cis women are ""clocked"" as trans women in the bathroom they're the victims of transmisogyny because they don't meet the bullshit expectations of cisnormativity but even in that situation the end goal is to make bathrooms more hostile for trans women.
Because it implies women are weak and no one should want to be like them etc.
""stale moldy wonderbread"" is brilliant!
I know the episode you're talking about. He also wrote black books which I used to love - such a shame.

Friends is particularly awful though, even Seinfeld, which is a much younger show and incredibly sexist, didn't have to rely on cheap shots.

I'm up to season 8 of friends and honestly I have no idea how it was so popular. It wasn't even funny until season 5, and everything about it is so basic, Joey is legitimately disgusting and his behaviour is lauded as funny. Because Chandler doesn't exert the same toxic masculinity as Joey, he's constantly shamed and as gay. Even Phoebe who's meant to be the ethical/empath of the group says the most toxic shit.
If you want a similar shock for feminism, watch Cheers. The main woman gets sexually assaulted (set up is played as a joke) and it just rolls as it being her fault. Another joke is main guy refusing to leave a woman's apartment after a date without having sex. 

Normalization through comedy is terrifyingly effective.
I really like the IT Crowd, but I know what you mean about that episode. Even before I knew I was trans, or knew anything about trans people, something about that episode felt obviously off to me.
They are cute tbh
Yeah, it was before I realized who I am, so I was just extremely confused and mildly annoyed. I didn't have much going on emotionally before I came out to myself.
Audience plants are common. However I was susceptible to the hypnosis.
Didn't even think about the sweater, they are soooooo comfy
Yeah holy shit I very much so agree with that. Most of hate is bread from ignorance. And yes for me it’s definitely more of like a self hatred thing. Because what some people say to me are things that I say to myself. And so it stresses me the fuck out when other people validate those thoughts.
I've honestly ended up relishing some of the looks I get.
thank you for pointing this out, having my insecurities validated by total strangers sucks, let alone the people that are supposed to care. thx dad for the trauma 🥲 time to work on that

There is a lot of TV from that era that is not worth rewatching because of similar issues. X Files for example has Mulder constantly sexually harass Scully in some really great examples of what to do if you want to get sent to HR.

Also, comedy shows, like Kids in the Hall don't live up to my memories of how funny they were outside of the handful of skits I remember fondly, the rest of the episodes are just not that funny.

 I realize that's because I have grown as a person since the 90s, and hopefully people just discovering these series today see and understand how problematic shows like Friends or X Files can be.
YES VERY MUCH SO!!! I really just want to have my avatars out fit honestly. Well with out the yellow skin.
It's the same way that saying ""you throw like a girl"" as an insult to a guy isn't misandrist, it's misogynistic.
It's founded in a devaluation of femininity. It's discrimination because of feminine traits. It would be misandry if it were devaluing masculinity. 

Misogyny and misandry aren't determined by the individual being targeted by the discrimination. They're determined by the cultural value assigned to the traits being targeted. The traits being attacked are stereotypically feminine traits. The attack is borne of a disdain for culturally feminine traits, and a higher value placed upon masculinity.
Because ""men in dresses"" is a time honored code for trans women. If they can invalidate trans women by painting them as men in dresses then it justifies their view that trans women aren't real women. As such, humor derived from men acting feminine is primarily targeted at trans women.

Do you know what intersectionality is? It's when two types of discrimination merge to become a new entity. I have experienced transphobia, however trans people of colour experience a mixture of racism and transphobia that is neither entire just racism or just transphobia which makes it a unique entity. My experience with transphobia doesn't correlate to there's because there's has a bunch of extra moving parts.

It's the same way with transmisogyny. It's a unique blend of misogyny and transphobia that is neither entirely one or the other.

And just so you know, the argument you are putting forward is a very common one used to discredit both sides of a discriminatory act that targets multiple minority characteristics. Frequently when Asians girls face racism and sexism as a combo it is dismissed on one side because it's not the same racist that Asian men face so it can't be racist, and it's not the same sexist that non Asian women face so it can't be sexist.

The reality is, it's both and that gives it a unique makeup compared to the individual components.
those are all considered feminine traits, “a man shouldn’t be like a girl”
HELL FUCKING YEA!!

what i’m saying is that the fact that feminine traits are seen as bad is misogynistic. Due to the patriarchy straight masculine white men are seen as at the top of the pyramid. If you diverge from the masculine norm it’s seen as wrong, because you are stooping to a lower place. The fact that femininity is seen as lesser is misogynistic

Probably because you're responses to everyone presenting you with other viewpoints has been ""Yeah, but you're wrong"".

My girlfriend threatened to expose my trans background , what should I do?	"Last week I officially came out to my girlfriend and told her I am a transgirl and wanted to do HRT and SRS.

She is the first person I have come out to and I really love her and trust her a lot. She has always said she is very open minded and says she is bisexual.

But after I came out to her, she seemed upset and angry and she thought I had cheated and hurt her. She would not allow me to have any HRT or surgery, but would accept me wearing makeup or women's clothing.

I was so conflicted and for this reason she threatened to break up with me and she said she was going to tell my parents and all my classmates at our school afterwards about me being trans.

The current situation is that I freaked out and compromised with her for now. But the truth is, she doesn't like that I really act like a transgender, and she keeps saying that transgender women are not pure and can never be real girls.

I'm really suffering, I don't know how I should face her, I want to break up but I'm afraid she will really expose all this to everyone around me，I'm asian and my community really do not accept trans issue.

I really don't know what to do...."	"Generally speaking you should never be with people who ask you to give up your entire identity to be with them, or to compromise on who you are. You deserve better and I recommend to break things off. You will find someone that accepts you for who you are, even if it seems scary and like you arent going to, you will. I know it.
Dump her

You're a trans woman, don't be with a transphobe

You deserve way, ***waaay*** better
Get out,  she is toxic af.  What she is doing is manipulative and it will only get worse.   Find your local lgbtqia+ resource center and start building yourself a support network of allies.  Make it clear to her that her threats and ultimatums are the cause for your breakup with her and if she goes through with it she only proves that she is a shit person not worthy of your love and affection.
First of all, protect yourself. Especially if you are in any physical danger. If you have to pretend for a bit in order to be safe, do so. Having someone threaten to out you, especially when you’re trans, can be extremely dangerous. If you’re able, I would try to get somewhere safe. If you still have feelings for your gf and that’s why you want to stay-although it doesn’t seem like that is what is happening-I promise she doesn’t love you and never did if she is threatening to out you. I’m so sorry this is happening to you
Sadly, there is no real compromise when it comes to transition. You transition and live as your true self, or…you live a lie, and feel utterly miserable at best. Some of the worst case scenarios are lethal.

From what you have described to me your girlfriend is not a healthy person to be in a relationship with. It sounds like she is toxic and controlling you. While it’s not uncommon for relationships to not survive transition, this isn’t a case where it *should*.

I won’t tell you what to do, but this is my advice:

- Find community in your area. I’m not sure what country you’re in so I can’t advise on resources, but they will be in the best position to point you towards resources and help you with an escape plan.

- **Have an escape plan in the event of the worst.** This is where community can help. Honestly, for your situation this sounds like something you’ll want to have regardless.

- I am NOT going to tell you to come out if you don’t want to. That is an intensely personal decision for each trans person, and if you feel you’d be in danger if you come out **absolutely do not do it.** With that said, your girlfriend is currently using the threat of outing you to keep you from transitioning and keep you compliant. If you do come out of your own free will, you take that power away from her. **I will stress again I am NOT telling you to come out if you’re not ready, ESPECIALLY if you do not feel safe - and if you do, and have no support, make sure you have an escape plan ready to execute.**

Best of luck. If you need to talk, I am always willing to listen. You’re loved more than you know by a lot of people out here 💕💙🤍💙💕
As others said, def get out of it asap. She sounds manipulative. Not someone you want to trust. Its one thing if she cant accept you being trans, but to threaten to out you by telling your family and classmates is crossing a very big line imo.
Yeah that’s a real tough situation. Honestly, I’d just bite the bullet and tell everyone myself and then break up with her. It’s not ideal. But in the end you’ll be happier for it when the fallout settles.
Thanks to all for the advice, you are all too kind for me.  
This is my first time posting on reddit because I didn't know who to go with to get advice.  
For now I plan to: 1. Talk to her again about my strong determination to have a TRANSITION.  
2. find a local transgender organization. But I am studying in Europe and the language issue makes the situation a bit complicated.  
3, hopefully I can break up with her peacefully, because I used to love her so much.
When I came out to my wife, she paused for a moment and then said “Okay?”

It didn’t matter to her one bit. She has had questions, but she respects my privacy (I’m not out beyond her yet with irl people) and she asks me regularly how she can better understand and support me.

If that’s not your experience, you haven’t got a partner. Support is so vital in relationships, and you deserve it as much as anyone.
Leave, personally I’d rather take the risk. But honestly, something makes me think they were empty threats anyway.
There's no trust. Leave her. Start your journey on your own pace then find your soul mate once you are transformed and accepted.
She’s not god for you. Here’s an example of a healthy relationship : I came out to my husband this year. It was a tough thing for me to do. He’s a straight man and I want to be a man. I could lose a lot. I have two kids with him and he’d get them because of how transphobic the state I live in is. But he’s first thing was to tell me he will love me nomatter what. He will miss my body but is willing to sacrifice that so I feel comfortable. I’m so lucky to have him. And if anyones else’s partner is not this accepting then they never truly loved you. It’s ok for them to have to get used to the idea or ask questions. But like my husband, they should want what’s best for your physical and mental health.
> I really don’t know what to do….

You do, you’re just afraid. You feel like you’re either not strong enough or not good enough to break up with her. You are, you deserve better.
Literally RUN. This is toxic and dangerous. Break things off with her immediately. Otherwise she will always hold this over your head. If she threatens you once to get her way, she will do it again. The trust is gone. Besides, trying to keep you from doing hrt by threatening to expose you is about the most evil thing a romantic partner can do. Break up with her, for your own sake. She might be pissed, but in no way can she treat you like this and expect to get away with it.

If she threatens to expose you when you break up, first tell her that you told her your secret in confidence because you trusted her. Her exposing that would be the deepest betrayal (This is to let her know how much she would hurt you). If she still threatens you and holds it over your head, or tries to put the blame on you (saying something that you betrayed her), I‘m afraid that you just have to bite the bullet and tell her that you can’t stop her from exposing you, but you’re gonna leave her anyways. Emphasise how bad of a human being she would have to be to expose your deepest secret just because she’s bitter. If she still goes through with it, then, I’m sorry to say, there’s really nothing you can do. You put your trust in someone who turned out to be a snake. It’s not your fault, it’s always hard to really know someone, and people get constantly backstabbed or disappointed by loved ones. Just make sure to distance yourself from that person.

If she does expose you, your life is not over, okay? As long as you can stay safe, it’ll be alright. I don’t know how old you are, but you sound pretty young. School is tough for trans people, especially if your community isn’t supportive. But you have to look for people who do support you. Are there any teachers who might support trans people? Try to ask some how they feel about trans people. If you find someone who is nice, tell them about your situation. They might be able to do something about it, or at least support and protect you if it comes out. Are there school mates who seem open minded? Any relatives? Literally anyone who could help you through this. Find them and stick with them. If she tells everyone, they will support you. They might even be able to stop her from telling people. Just get help. With that I’m sure you will get through it just fine.

If there really is no one you can trust and it might be dangerous to come out, (and I know this is not good advice - so take this with a grain of salt) you should just lie. You shouldn’t have to pretend to be someone else, and telling the truth is always better than lying, BUT if your safety is at stake and there is no one to help you, just say that she is lying because she’s bitter about the break up, and say that you are cis. I know it sucks, but if it is dangerous and you fear physical attacks or your parents sending you to some conversion camp, just lie and wait until you can move out, get a job and then transition. 

Im sorry this is happening to you. I may not know your girlfriend, but just based on this she‘s a pretty shitty person. I hope you’ll be okay!
Hello, looking from her initial words, I would think she is hurt, thinking marriage, children etc. I could be wrong, but maybe it would be better for you both to separate. Talk though
Holy, what a shitshow. To be completely frank ... dump her ass. She's openly manipulating you. That's abuse. She might be exposing you, but at this point there's nothing you can do about it anymore. You gave her all the power and your only options are to risk it or assume the role of a hostage. But don't think that giving in makes you safe. She will still have the same power over you and can use it whenever she doesn't like what you're doing.

Alternatively you can ""disarm"" her by coming out yourself but that's not something you should rush if you don't feel comfortable about it.

I'm really sorry, but this situation is as bad as it sounds. Either she gives in or you're fucked either way. All you can do is to try and minimize the damage now.
People talk to the talk but when it directly involves them they can’t walk the walk. Be who you are and surround yourself with people that accept you for your true self.
Dump her. She’s being toxic and doesn’t love you as a who you really are.
i’m sorry sorry. the best option is probably to just not continue with this toxic relationship. if it makes you feel ANY better my ex broke up with me when i came out to him (there was barely any gap between my own realization of my gender and coming out to him) because he ‘couldn’t be with someone who was masculine at all’ as if i wasn’t called a tomboy and low maintenance for 20 years before that… i have always been very androgynous and used to hate wearing girly clothes until i got more confident in myself and my gender so jokes on him because now i wear cute dresses and shit and he doesn’t even know much less get to enjoy or see it. (he enjoyed when i wore girly stuff but also he had bad taste in dresses lol)
Break up! She's not worth it, I promise
I'd recommend u out yourself, atleast to your friends before doing anything with her, it's better they hear your version first. And about her, i think the best is dump her, what kind of person threatens their loved ones? Who does comments to hurt their loved ones? She is abusing u mentally.
all the people saying ""dump her"" are showing they aren't caring to actually understand the situation. it sounds like it isn't safe to dump her. 

but know this: you are being abused. from this point forward, prioritise yourself entirely. don't feel sorry for her. do what you have to do to keep yourself safe (pretending to still want to be with her if you have to) but get in touch with any queer/trans resources or support groups that can advise you better on what to do under these specific circumstances. people who understand your local community. get yourself safe, and I hope you can eventually never have to see her again.
Try to have a calm discussion with her, make sure she understands that:  
1. You're showing a lot of trust by telling her, it's the opposite of cheating and lying.  
2. You can't stay together if she doesn't accept you and is actively trying to hurt you.  


Protect yourself if you feel like you're in danger, you can lie if you have to. People will likely believe your word over hers if you spin it right, but hopefully it won't come to that.
This is abuse. Get out.
*Sighs* I went through exactly the same thing with my ex boyfriend, minus the threats of outing me but he did try manipulating me and controlling me over it, saying things like ""why don't you just try drag instead?"" and expecting me to do things at his pace, which would have kept me a feminine man for ever. It doesn't get better, stand your ground... tell her that this is who you are and no amount of threats or ultimatums will change that. If she follows through with her threats, well then she is just a pathetic excuse for a human being.
She's making you choose between yourself or her. She doesnt 'allow' you to transition. She can either support you or not and it seems she made her coice.
what do you mean, ""not allow you""? shes not your mom, you can do what you like
I think you should make it clear the kind of danger you would be in if she told on you, and break up with her. Be explicit and realistic about the risks. She might be hurt and controlling and upset, even vindictive, but most of the time, people don't want to get someone else killed or injured.

But before you break up with her, have a plan for how and where you will live, and stay safe, in the case she does tell your community about your gender.
i stopped talking to my ex for a similar reason. get yourself safe first, and find someone you CAN talk to, preferably an adult. does your school have a counselor? will your friends accept you? tell whoever you can safely before she does.
you might have to lie to stay safe for a while, and i’m so sorry. please remain true to yourself inside. this girl is not your friend, especially not after threatening to out you. you are not obligated to try and change her mind. i hope someday she can see that you’re a woman just the same.
Oh this an easy guess, she full of it and doesn’t want a gf.  She wants you to be a crossdressing man so she could keep the man as srs and hrt would remove what she wants…

Recommend talking to her why she does not want you to do hrt and such and if it a step too far you two might have to drift away.  Or not.  But remember dysphoria doesn’t go away that easily, ask any old transgender person that repressed into their 30s or 40s.
Yeah you need to break up asap. Before you do though I'd maybe tell your parents a more believable lie about why she would lie to your parents about you. Maybe tell them you cheated on her and now she's hell bent on ruining your life or something like that. Or if you want to stay the golden child tell your parents on different occasions that she isn't treating you right so your parents are already against her before she can try and out you. As long as she doesn't have a confession in writing your parents will probably believe you first.
Dump her. Get out. Call her a lier when she tries to out you. Tell everyone she's just bitter that you broke up with her. 
Speaking from experience, this situation will only get worse as time goes on.
Okay, let's get something straight right away.

>I was so conflicted and for this reason she threatened to break up with me and she said she was going to tell my parents and all my classmates at our school afterwards about me being trans.

🚩🚩🚩MANIPULATION🚩🚩🚩  
This is **not** a trustworthy person. Any trust you have for her, go ahead and dump that right out the window because anyone that would make such a malicious threat doesn't care about you like you think she does. If she doesn't want you to transition in ways you want to, then the relationship isn't going to work out, it is not her right to dictate to you what you can & can't do. But, it is the right of both of you to leave that relationship if it isn't working out based upon those reasons. 

She is NOT open minded and NOT an ally, despite her being LGBTQ. I could see her getting a TON of backlash from the LGBTQ community for being in the acronym yet opening up a transperson to danger.

Let me share a life lesson I learned with you. Sometimes it's better to take the punch, be it metaphorical or physical, and say ""*fuck you, I'll take another*"" than it is to succumb to threats & violence. Don't let her have any dominion over you with her blackmail. I'd also suggest taking a peak at the law regarding extortion because, while the law is not progressive, if they have reason to believe that revealing such a thing could result in harm, you may have a last-resort option.
There’s no compromise here. You ARE trans, period. She is demanding you pretend to be someone you’re not for her own comfort.

Breaking up with her is a foregone conclusion. You need to do that no matter what. But there’s two ways to do this:

1. Come out publicly if it’s safe for you to do so. If you don’t believe you’ll be in serious physical danger by doing so, this will remove her teeth and her leverage. Additionally you tell EVERYONE in your life that you broke to with her explicitly because she freaked out and started saying a bunch of transphobic and hateful things to you, and tried blackmailing you after you came out to her. You do this before she has the opportunity to twist the facts to others. This will get you sympathy, this will put her as the bad guy.

2. Break up with her. If you can’t safely come out tell people she started being extremely controlling and you couldn’t take it anymore. That when you did she freaked out and told you she was going to lie and tell everyone that your gay and trans and have serious mental issues etc. again do this before she gets the chance to twist things against you.
Get the hell out now. She is a TERF and so fucking disgusting.
/u/JulesLynncc Hey friends, it sounds like she has an imagined abandonment right now. From someone who has borderline and has been in therapy for 5 years, this sounds like borderline personality disorder. It also sounds like she is a long way from recovery. For right now, there is NOTHING you can do to help her. She is experiencing a symptom called “splitting.” It is the primary characteristic of borderline, where we start to think in black and white, and if she has no training in therapy, then it will not end until it ends. Just tell her you are scared of her right now and need some space. LEAVE IT AT THAT. Let me know if you need anything.
Break up with her. And if she tells people you're trans before you're ready to be out, you can say she's making things up because she's upset about the breakup. I know that probably sounds like a shitty thing to do, but outing sometime without their consent (or even just threatening to) is 1000 times worse.
She “Won’t allow you” to take HRT ? Leave. She’s horrible. There are plenty of girls who would love to be your partner while supporting you transition.
Get a girlfriend who isn't a flaming ball of garbage
Yikes, get away from her
dump her
Nah, time to move on. I get that she’s “shocked” or whatever. But she gets 0 say on what you do or how you live your life. This is NOT A NEGOTIATION. 

How would she feel if she wanted something gender conforming, but you said no?
She does not deserve you if she treats you like that. If you want maybe try and talk things through with her, maybe you can convince her to keep it private? I hope everything will work out in your favor <3
You mustn't bow to her threats. You may love her but she's treating you like shit. You don't blackmail and threaten someone you love.
she's not your GF she's an abuser. 

tell her to fuck off.
She’s on the wrong side of the line, she’s not an ally, she’s outright transphobic. I’m really sorry that you trusted the wrong person.
Break up with her.  You don't want to be with someone who can't love you for who you are and won't stand by you as you try to become the person you want to be. 

Trans women ARE women.
Ditch her ass, she's obviously trash
As hard as it might be to hear, she’s not worth it! If somebody, especially a significant other, wont support you then they aren’t worth your time or energy. Everybody needs someone who will accept them for who they are, and anyone who threatens you because of you expecting that of them, isn’t someone that you should be with. You shouldn’t waste your time feeling bad about not wanting to be with her anymore if she isn’t gonna put the same amount of thought towards your identity(something that is actually important).
If that threat exists now, it'll exist later as well. Breaking up with her now vs a month or longer from now makes no difference.

Being outed sucks. There's no way it won't suck. If you break up with her, the best you can do is prepare for the conversations you'll have to have with the people close to you, and maybe even preempt them so their exposure to the truth won't be in a sensationalized context. Basically your scenarios are:

1. You stay with her and are miserable until it falls apart sometime in the future. Maybe she'll out you when that happens.

2. You break up. Maybe she outs you. 


Either way, you have the option to spin it as her being out for revenge and denying that you're trans, coming out first and controlling the narrative, or letting her tell everyone and watch her vilify you and make it all about her. My recommendation would be number two, but tell your family in person or in a letter first, so you have the chance to share your complete story and thoughts. Your hand is being forced, and it really fucking sucks, but you won't be able to hide forever if you want the overly positive take.


Find community and resources before you do anything. A student org, friends, a nonprofit or other organization, etc. Don't do whatever you do alone.
...""not pure"", not ""real"": define those things for me.

I'm human, and I believe you are as well. Can we both agree that the two sexes are not too far different? 

A cloister of cells being a different shape at point of birth, from the expression of a single gene, does not get to dictate what defines me or you.

I'm a woman, because I've always been one. To hell with those that think I'm not. I spent over 30 years with me. 

Ask them how long they've been inside your head or walked in your shoes. Ask your girlfriend why she chose to take away your bodily autonomy and why she's extorting you.

Darling, you are better off without her as it stands.
It doesn’t say your age here but I’m assuming you’re young by your mention of school. My best advice is to not change yourself to please someone else if it’s safe to let your true colors show. If you are not in danger by your parents and classmates knowing about your identity, then I would certainly immediately break up with her. She cannot force you to give up parts of your transition for her comfort. 

My partner and I have been together for 4 years and they came out to me about a year ago and have been on T for about 10 months now. It’s a strange transition for the partners involved because you’re watching your partners gender expression shift completely and sometimes the attraction doesn’t match anymore but if you love that person and feel you are able to maintain that attraction, then you support the transition and maintain your relationship. That’s what my partner and I did. In your case with your girlfriend, she does not sound at all supportive or like the attraction can be maintained so the relationship should be terminated. It doesn’t even sound like you should be friends. 

If you feel like you are in mild danger by letting your family and classmates know about your transition then I encourage you to tell a trusted adult about your situation and explain to your girlfriend that you could be in danger and you’re not ready to come out yet. Maybe that trusted adult could help be the mediator in the conversation. But you will have to judge the severity of the potential danger. Unfortunately you might have to play along with her game for your safety if there is genuine and 
serious danger and safety concerns

But if something takes a turn and you do get outed, please know that you will be okay. I was outed too. I was in middle school and my best friend at the time told the whole school I was gay. I lost a lot of friends that I later realized weren’t worth it anyway and I lost some family too. But here I am with my partner I’ve had since I was 16 and I’m so happy despite it all. 

Just don’t forget that if you stay true to yourself and if you work hard to ensure you’re the only one that has the power to influence your happiness, you will be okay. Everything will work out and you will be happy. Good luck and I’m sorry that this is happening. No one deserves this. But you’re strong and can make it through
Girl, she is toxic and transphobic, dump her ass or annoy her until she dumps you. As for the Asian community thing, you can always just deny it, she’s the only one who knows, she is the crazy ass person, you can tell other people about her being toxic and crazy and they might think she is making up lies. Anyway hope all goes well for you. Im asian and trans too and I get how you feel, not being able to come out to people cuz Asia is kind of more conservative
The reality seems to be that she only loves you for what you can offer to her. You are an “item” of instrumental worth to her.

I hate to be a typical reddit guy, but I’d say good riddance for you. You deserve to live for no one other than yourself. You deserve better.
As far as i know bisexuals have very open mind than alot of people, but she is currently using your secret as a tool to force her desires upon you , from your words i expect her to be narcissist in a harmful way, which mean she is manipulating you  so to end the situation you have to pretend that you don't care much , this is toxic relationship as she seems to be transphobic too , unless you want your relationship to continue you rather end it , to end it show her no love nor interest!
""open minded"" nah this woman is transphobic AF leave before it's too late
Yeah... Break up with her, and if she follows through cut contact with any friends who take her side. While sudden isolation sucks, not being able to be your true self, because of your bitch of a gf is worse.
Sounds like there's a nice curb with her name on it waiting for you to kick her to it.
She’s fucked up, done, if you still have to “lay-low” for a while just act like she’s making shit up bc she’s mad bc idk… you don’t like her anymore or whatever.
Do you have anything on her?
Dump her lame ass. Never compromise your trueidentity just to appease someone.
Many people are already saying this but get the fuck outta there
First off, no one can stop you from doing what you want this is your life and your body. 

Secondly this is extremely abusive behavior, I understand that this may be a shock to her but this is not an appropriate response. 

You should be fine breaking up with her just make sure you do not talk about this over text or give her any kind of proof to show other people. That way if she tries to help you tell everyone she’s fucking crazy, tell people she cheated on you and this is her trying to control you after you found out. 

And if people ask you laugh it off., no one‘s going to believe her if she has no proof.
She’s a abusive transphobic manipulative cunt. I’m sorry that you told you’re deepest darkest secret to someone who you thought would never betray you. But she did. What she is doing is completely evil. You are a woman and you want you’re body to reflect that. Assuming you are from a country that won’t murder you for being lgbtq. You need to take control of the situation. I’d recommend telling friends who might be supportive to not only your new identity and what your gf is doing. Some people who I thought would never accept me ended up being my biggest supporters. You are in a completely vulnerable situation and you need to gather support from friends and family. You cannot let her hold this over you and be her prisoner. She might be LGB but clearly not T! Obviously breaking up with her is the best thing to do and own your identity. You are a women and that’s it. However if you want to compromise. Tell her whatever she wants to hear. BUT MOVE FORWARD WITH TRANSITIONING ANYWAY!! It will take months before she will notice the effects of hrt and it gives you time to prep for the break up / outting. She also could be bluffing just to keep her under her thumb. You have the support of everyone on this Subreddit. You are not alone. Please feel free to message me if you need someone to talk to. I have been in a similar situation. 

A girl in college adored me until I came out as trans. I thought she’d have my back but instead she read me quotes from the Bible and dipped. In Highschool i was in a relationship where she ended up cheating on me and was completely controlling.
There is always a communtiy for you out there, you should break up with her, and i dont see why she wouldnt want to break up if she really is that close minded about trans issues
DTMFA!! You can't have a relationship with someone who is holding a gun to your head. People who threaten blackmail or give you ultimatums or hold you emotionally hostage are not good people and you should end that relationship immediately, and thank your lucky stars that you discovered she's trash before you did something dumb like marry her. You should be able to come out on your own terms and at your own pace. People are going to figure it out sooner or later, but it shouldn't be from your ex-girlfriend putting you on blast. If she does, it's going to reflect worse on her than it does on you. Most people are pretty accepting these days, I hope you find yourself surprised by the love and support of your community. I was.
Give me her home address so I can politely discuss my opinions on transphobia with her.

More seriously, get her the hell out of your life as quickly as possible and talk to a therapist about the experience of you can.
If you can't come out yet, deny in bloc if she tries to out you, you can just leverage sexism against her and shrug saying she just turned crazy, that will seem more plausible to your family.
You deserve love and support.

I’m sorry your girlfriend is not being supportive.

She sounds toxic and I don’t know why she would want to control you like that.

I hope you have supportive friends and family,because your girlfriend doesn’t sound very supportive.

Listen to your heart. Do what’s best for you.
If you have to lie about who you are, you are in the wrong place.
You haven’t packed your bags because… ???
Did you tell her in person or over some form of messaging service? (Texting, social media, etc)

If you only came out in person, make sure you leave no trace of you confirming or talking about being trans over messages.

If she tries to talk to you about you being trans over messages, reply as though you're confused and don't know what she's talking about:

""What? I'm not trans..."" ""What are you talking about? that never happened..."" Etc...

If you're in a genuinely dangerous situation for a trans person to be out, then just deny anything she says and leave no proof to her claims.

>I really love her and trust her a lot.

In your mind, change this to ""I used to"" because this is a person who does not love you, who does not care for you, and who is actively willing to harm you and ruin your life.

Regardless of what type of situation you're in, remove all the evidence of you being trans and then leave her forever.
She's a transphobe, break up with her and find someone who will let you have the HRT and surgery you need.
Please please get out. She seems to have that terf mentality and that will do nothing but harm YOU. She sounds very controlling and manipulative and just over all abusive. Your partner should NEVER say such things to you, about you like that. Reach out to resource centers, look for support groups either online or in person but please start building your support network that you need. It really sucks that trans and even queer folks gotta do all this preparation just in case it all comes crashing down but you need to get ready for the worst. Especially since you said you were Asian, I imagine these issues are heavily stigmatized in your culture. Just please be safe, im hoping it all works for you. There is always a new person to love you FOR YOU. Sending love ❤
Dump her. NEVER trade happiness for someone’s comfort, especially someone controlling and abusive like that
Just do a little maneuver called The Surf no TERF
What you should do is accept you no longer have a girlfriend because your identity is valid, you know who you are and you deserve a better partner than this person. It sucks, I’m sorry you’re in this position. I’m sure you’ll find someone who actually loves and supports you as you are.
You dont need that kind of negatively in your life. life's short if she dosent want you for who you are than its not ment to be and some day you will find someone who does want you for you. As for outing my ex posted the worst pics of me all over fb for weeks and refused to take them down she sent my family pictures and everything and the response she got wasent what she was expecting she lost alot of friends and made alot of people no longer trust her. I didn't respond to her at all or anything she did I just left it where it was and alot of people that seen it haven't said a word about it to me they mention how messed up she is for what she did
Dump her. You don’t need someone that thinks you aren’t a real woman. She has her own issues that she needs to deal with and it isn’t fair for her to attempt to blackmail you to get her way.

She may out you anyway as revenge if she is like that, but it is better than being chained and controlled by her.
Girl get out of there, she will always try to controll how you present if you don't leave, you're in all your right to WHATERVER you want with your body
Make sure you have a good support system when you leave, block her number on ur parents phones. If she does end up telling people, you could tell everyone that she's making up stuff because she's mad that you broke up with her. You could also report her to your school if she does start rumors.
hate to say but most people are fucked man,, it gets to the point where you cant trust anybody and even spending time looking for close friendships is a complete waste of energy.. maybe you should think about locating to a big city with a trans community where you can find a surrogate family of people who all have similar storys ?
if she doesnt have receipts (ie u came out in text or talked ab it at all through text) just leave her. if she tells everyone ur trans u can just act like shes bitter u left her and is spreading a nasty rumor.

it sucks to have to deny yourself like that, but theres no shame in doing what u need to to stay in the closet and stay safe.
I had an ex like this! You need to break up! Don’t worry about the consequences, you’ll be a lot happier without her by the sounds of it. She sounds really emotionally abusive and you deserve better than that. If she tells everyone you both know then most people she tells will think she’s a huge asshole, therefore being more of a backlash for her than you. Good luck, stay safe!
I think if people bring it up to you, just act as if it’s a lie. Straight up just be confused and say no with a little laugh (not a nervous laugh though). You could make people believe that she’s just trying to screw you over since you broke up with her. It will be stressful for a bit but it can be cleared up. If you stay with her, she might get proof and you’ll also be miserable. Break up, deal with the undeserved consequences after.
That is a tough situation with some nasty consequenses on both ends. 

To be honest, fuck that toxic blackmailing transphobic bitch, dump her. 

If... IF she outs you to your parents/classmates, so be it. That is on her, but then it is over. You can't let someone crush you like that for the rest of your life, dear. 

Seek someone who you trust and can offer you a safe space.
If you want to vent, my dm is open for you. 
It breaks my heart reading your story. 

Take care, and stay honest to yourself. 
Let nobody crush you like that, you are as much of a real women like any other. Love :)
Break her neck, idk
""I really love and trust her"" -op

Ops girlfriend *blackmails op*

As for what you should do I don't really know what to tell you. I'll tell you you'll meet plenty of girls but only transition once
I'm sorry but you're girlfriend is a TERF.
You deserve better and know that you are always loved! You can always hit me up if you wanna vent or speak about anything. You are gonna wanna show the world your amazing side one time or another anyway. I think it's better to cut down communication with her silently and try to talk to other people that you feel like you can trust
DUMP HER. That is fucking disgusting to hold over someone’s head and she’s being controlling. Ew. I’m so sorry, OP.
I hope you are ok. I know what leaving her will mean. You are going to face some backlash anyway since she has already told you her plans. So the way I see it you have two options. You could stay with her, be emotionally abused and have to deal with the repercussions of being a trans person in the closet (potentially forever). Or, you can get ahead of the situation. You have a chance to come out slowly now. To family at least. Explaining the situation that your partner put you into in detail and coming out to your family (if it is safe to do so) is probably the best chance you have right now. Then you have somewhere to go and be safe from her because I can tell you that you are no longer safe with her. She has shown you what she is willing to do. You should only ever be proud to be part of this community. You deserve to come out on your own terms but she took that away. So do what you can to make it on your terms with your current situation. Before anything tho reach out to any trans communities in your area and prepare your escape plan. I don't know where you live so do what you need to do but please do it safely. She has probably shattered all your trust in people rn but there are people here to talk to anytime. I am available to dm if you need to talk. Good luck.
Break up with her. She’s abusing you by putting you in this situation. Your partner should never threaten you. Never ever.
Dump her! You deserve better
Easy plan: 

Step one: LIE for your own safety. Tell her you don’t know what you were talking about and that you’re “definitely cis” and straight and we’re just confused. I know none of that is true, but that’s the point. Let her think you’re not trans. Back pedal HARD. 

Step two: Break up with her and say you need time to work on yourself or some bs. 

Step three: Cut all contact with her by all possible means. 

Step four: Transition in the safest and best way you possibly can and find supportive community here on Reddit 💖💖💖
Yeah, this takes me back. I remember coming out to my gf at the time, and her immediate response was ""you are no longer financially viable"", then she stood up and left. 

She went on to tell all of our friends that I'd actually cheated on her (I've never cheated on anyone) and our friends believed her. Great times.
Dump her. She doesn't really love you if she's asking you to suppress who you are because she doesn't like it. If she's into girls as well then it shouldn't even be a problem. Don't date a transphobe
That's very rude, you should find someone else, she might feel hurt or something like that, but that doesn't gives her the right to betray your trust and threaten you with something that personal.
If she's exposing you and you're not ready, I guess you can just deny it and say things like ""See, she's crazy, that's why we broke up"".
""Not pure"" . . .




Hella yikes.
If this was my situation I'd tell her to take a hike then come out on my own the way I needed to. However, I'd only do this after I've made a coming out plan while being sweet and telling her what she wants to hear. 
The way I see it, this blackmailing woman will likely roll on you sooner rather than later. 

Best

Don’t stay with a transphobe who doesn’t respect you, period
You sound like you are in a really difficult situation. On one hand, you can keep it quiet, stay with her, be in the closet. And still have your family and community. And if you come out, you risk losing all of that. 

Always put your physical safety first.
Maybe look into moving out (if you live with her) and being able to sustain yourself on your own incase you lose all supports.

I'd look into joining groups like discards to build a safer social community and maybe try to find some places nearby that are accepting. Sometimes a support group or therapist can help with this since there's a professional helping or people with similar experiences. They might be able to help you plan and come up woth solutions.

Eventually you'll have to decide to come out or not but that's not necessarily something you have to do right now.

Maybe look for local LGBT resources and organizations. 

I hope this helps. Good luck.
Time to be single.
Gurl you gotta leave that bish. She obviously does not have your best interests at heart.

She's a manipulative piece of shit who doesn't deserve your love or trust.

Tell her that her threats and hurtful words tell you that she doesn't love you and that your relationship obviously doesn't mean anything to her so it's best if you part ways.
You can lie to your friends and community at first, saying that you wanted to break up with her for a while and now she’s spreading lies about you because you broke up with her and add this as a reason you dont want to be with her anymore. 

Eventually when going on HRT and getting surgery, you must come out but make sure to be in a save, stable environment and prepare to lose your family and community, it really is not easy. I (also asian) was almost outed the other day and if it actually happened, I could be dead or an orphan right now because of my family and my community would be ashamed of ever having had me. Be careful while coming out and transitioning, also always carry something to defend yourself with because this is not a nice world.
Yoinks TERF alert. It sounds like she’s gonna be more harmful to you than helpful. I’m so sorry your going through this baby
Ew she’s transphobic. Leave her and get hotter than her
Before I was 100% sure about my identity I had an ex gf who didn't even wanna engage in any conversation regarding the idea of me maybe being a trans girl and I was MISERABLE with her so.. I strongly recommend breaking up, being in a relationship with someone who doesn't accept you the way you are is terrible.
The only way out is through.

Sorry to say it, but there is no good solution to this, just the right solution. Which is obviously to break up with her.

Your GF is, sorry to say it, a total piece of shit.
It sounds like she isn't on board for you being trans so you can just pretty much end this relationship. Having to continue to not be who you are will just hurt you long run and you can definitely find someone who will love you for who you are.
can't give any advice that hasn't already been said in the comments, but i just want to say that is a seriously shitty situation and you deserve so much better then this. i'm so sorry. sending all of my love to you.
Holy. Fucking. Shit. This is probably the worst ive seen on here
Break up with her and possibly get a sort of restraining order if you really need to. (May be extreme)
try to befome more distant, dont text back as quick, dont seem as interested when with her, etc or try to educate her or get someone to educate her, it will take a while but if you want to still be with her then id do the second thing, im so sorry this is happening
Oh no :( that’s awful, I’m so sorry.

First of all, dump her asap. That reaction is genuinely so disgusting of her. The fact she’s ~ALLOWING~ you to do some things is a MAJOR red flag. She doesn’t own you, you’re not her property.

Second, I’m personally not too sure what I’d do in the situation of being outed. For your own safety could you just.. deny it for now? You absolutely do not need to disclose to anyone if you are transgender or not. If you’re in a situation where transitioning socially and medically can put you in harms way there’s absolutely nothing wrong with waiting until you’re at a safer place in life to peruse your transition. Whether or not you’ve started to socially transition or medically transition you’re still a valid trans person if that’s what you feel like. It sounds like you’re young seeing as you mentioned classmates. I’ll say that there’s never any major reason to rush the transition process and you’re not going to run out of time or anything.

The most important thing here is to keep yourself safe. If you’re worried that the people around you IRL are going to be problematic if they knew you were trans, you don’t need to tell them or confirm whether or not you’re trans or not. Play dumb, ask “what’s that?” If someone asks you and you’re not comfortable with telling them.

Stay safe friend!
That's serious abuse.

I'm sure you're not staying with her, you need to get out ASAP. The danger here is being outed or being abused. You may need to start telling other people close to you so you can break up with her.

I'm so sorry, you're really in a place with no right answers
Are you parents ok with people being trans? Depending on the state/country you live in their are laws against her exposing, you could possibly tell her if she exposes you that you can sue, I know that some people wouldn't care and would tell anyway though. It's fucked up you're in this situation, is their anymore information you'd be willing to tell of this situation? I would like to do some research and help if you want
No matter what the future holds you now have a partner who literally blackmailed you. 

If it were me I would completely lose all trust and respect.
You can always break up with her and play off any outing attempts as efforts to slander you/ruin your image.
Based on the title, break up with, and break all contact.
She’s not open-minded. She a bigoted, selfish asshole who wants to control you and keep you from being your true self.  She deserves to be unhappy and alone for acting that way.  She should know better than anyone as a member of the LGBTQ+ community that outing someone else is NEVER ok, and threatening to do so as a manipulation tactic is worse.  She sounds like JK Rowling with her rhetoric.
Your girlfriend's behavior is toxic and abusive. If you can find a way to come out to everyone and then leave her, do that.
If being with her means not being you then both of you are being cheated out of the real potential from the relationship anyway. That her first response was to wield your trusted info as a weapon against you, something to try to isolate you from friends and family, shows that there are some deep issues that need addressed if staying together is to be considered. Honestly if this isn't the sort of thing where actual couples therapy is involved then I say break up because it isn't likely to improve as every sign of your being trans will be interpreted as your rebellion to her expectations, creating conflict as she tried to maintain control.
Turn tables; dump her and expose what a shitty controlling person she is to her friends and classmates
Your gf sounds like a shitty fucking person. I understand you love her, but her pulling such an ultimatum is a colossal red flag.
I would say run, but I have no experience
This could be life threatening to a trans person. It's not to be taken lightly
the fact she even threatened that in the first place shows she's not great, don't stay with her
break up
> she doesn't like that I really act like a transgender

This doesn't make any sense. First of all, *transgender* is an adjective so it's not ""a transgender"", just ""transgender"". With that out of the way, there is no one way to be or act trans. Trans people aren't a monolith and any idea of ""you don't act transgender"" is pure stereotype nonsense.

> and she keeps saying that transgender women are not pure and can never be real girls

This is blatant discrimination and transphobia. 

Dump her. You deserve someone who loves who you are, not a controlling psycho.
Don’t sacrifice being yourself to please her
In all honesty I would leave. I do not know your situation but I’ve been married for 4 years and if my wife ever got mad and did that I would walk away with nothing and never ever turn back around it is an inexcusable absence of personal decency that I will not tolerate in a friend or a lover.
I come from a joint family of two military families, and my grandfather is a priest. I can tell you, no matter how bad it is, you should tell. It reveals who really cares about you, and they cant use it as blackmail. If you tell, you can be more open about who you are. I know I get stares in public, but I don't let others stop me from being me.  Your girlfriend is probably just scared that you'll be cuter than her.
Dump her, being outed sucks but at the end of the day there will always be people that support you, and you would have probably had to eventually come out to them anyway. Being outed is better than being in a relationship that unhappy imo
I would hard pass on her. If she was the right person for you, this wouldn't be an issue. My partner didn't even have to come out to me, I just picked up on a bunch of their cues and raised it with them in a safe and comfortable environment. I will do nothing but love and support them through their journey no matter where that journey takes them (transitioning  hrt surgery or just staying as how they are now). Your partner should be your biggest supporter, if it's not for everyone that's fine but there's a difference to it not being your thing or being straight out transphobic.
Come out to them first. So she looks like a right cunt when she does it, then dump her ass. She doesn’t care about you based on this, she cares about the image of herself being in what she sees as a “normal” relationship. There’s no room for you in her narcissism - get out while you can. Unless you think she’ll come around and this was only a knee jerk reaction from her. I’d still take the power of her threat away regardless though, it’ll be funny - unless there’s reason not to
Dump her if you fell safe doing so if not get in touch with someone you trust [e.g authorities].
Lie
may sound harsh, but find something to blackmail her. like she is doing with you.
Yeaa. I don't always go for the ""dump them over any little problem"" aproach, and I will say, in my personal experience, people can come around to HRT kinda stuff if they are slightly open to changes in that regard. 

But this instance seems like a good reason to break up. Never liked the trans thing from the start, threatening their partners familial relationship and potentially her safety. Just really not promising
yeah if she wasn't attracted at all to the sex that you were transitioning to i could understand the breaking up part, it would be sad but i can at least see the reasoning behind that, but i don't see the reasoning behind insulting or attacking the person over it.
Red. Flags. Everywhere. Get out. She’s trying to control you. She is a shit person.
This. Very much this. If she is trying to use outing you or outs you then she is toxic and you need to run and don’t look back.
Precisely. She doesn't deserve you if she's going to treat you that way.
Exactly! start building a network. With this reaction its likely she will out you anyway. You need to have people you can fall back on. I'm so sorry this is happening OP. To have someone you trust betray you like this is terrifying & aweful.
I think this is so important. Nobody should live in a closet, but some people have to until they can move someplace safe.

I stand up for trans rights, but I have the privilege of living in a place where the law is on my side (even if only technically).

Protect yourself, nobody here knows your town or family. We all want the best for you though and you don't deserve this.
Thanks, this is very useful for me
Yeah never give someone else the self destruct button to your life, if they have it, nuke it yourself. It’s always better to have control over the situation rather then to watch it happen outside of your influence. 
Take control of the narrative, because it’s your story, so you tell it. Hope it goes well for you! 
Ps. But yeah she seems toxic, better to find out now before your heart gets in too deep!
I wonder how long have you two been together ever since? Since I can tell it has been very hard for the both of you,,

I am very happy to hear that however :)
You could even make the case that OP was the one who was lied to, as they wrote “She has always said she is very open minded,” but her reaction to OP coming out has proven that she isn’t.
I was wondering if anyone else would recommend this. I’ve found lying imperative for my safety and survival in the past when I was closeted. It might sound bad to do, but sometimes it’s necessary. I probably would have said that the ex is lying to ruin my life just so that my parents would believe me and I could buy more time to be in a position where leaving them by my own means would be feasible.
Also it would be badass if you were to render her leverage useless like that
>Yeah never give someone else the self destruct button to your life, if they have it, nuke it yourself.

It's complicated. She seemed very nice when she had control over me, but once I was out of her control, she went crazy.
Yeah 100%, relationships should never be about control. It can happen very subtly though, sometimes just trying to make the other person happy can lead to a level of emotional manipulation though. I’ve been in a lot of emotionally controlling(abusive relationships) and never realized it until after the fact. Because sometimes it’s hard to realize because from the inside it seems like just trying your best to make the relationship work, but not knowing that the other person is holding the success of the relationship hostage to bend you to their will, and that’s because just simply managing friendships and relationships is about give and take, and emotional manipulators take that to their advantage, and stipulate to you what you need to give to make the situation work or else……… things go sour, and they play this game over and over until your desensitized to the drastic measure you have to go to please them.
And that’s why psychologists and psychiatrists exist lol to help us out of these holes. Because sometimes we are convinced(unwittingly by the abuser) that we’re the problem and “we” have to be better to make this relationship work.
We’ve known each other for 6 years, married for 4 and just came out about 4 months ago. Like I didn’t know the feelings I was having about my body and stuff until read about Eliot pages story and the light bulb went off
Yeah that’s why it’s better to just be really careful, especially who you let “control you”, that’s a hard one because I get it I really do, sometimes it happens without you realizing it but, you gotta protect yourself from emotional manipulation, it happens way too often, and when it does happen you put yourself in a situation where you can’t truly be honest with that person because you have been acting and saying what makes them happy and that makes you happy, but then when something like this comes along and totally throws a wrench in the gears of the perfectly curated Situation, things aren’t so perfect anymore and change specifically in a direction those people aren’t comfortable or wasn’t in their grand plan, for how things should have ended up. Often turns things either physically violent or emotionally violent, both of which are a direct result of said person loosing control.
Relationships should never be about control, that's an abusive situation
As others said, she should never have control over you in the first place. Controlling someone's life isn't nice and toxic in and off itself
That is abusive behavior. It isn’t a good thing in a relationship. It will not get better unless she puts hard work into stopping that behavior, whatever her reasons are. She will likely use those tactics on other aspects of your relationship too.
I think you already know the answer for yourself. She's not someone who deserves you, don't stick around because it's tolerably comfortable.
I'm genuinely curious, how did he handle the news? Like what's it like for you two ever since you started transitioning (if you did)? Hope I am not prying, usually these kinds of relationships don't last long so seeing one that does makes me really happy and curious :)
I went through that… And even though it has been over a year already and she has a new life and a new bf, I somehow still did not manage to get out of her control, so effective it was… So OP, run as soon as you can!
We’re going at it stronger than ever actually. I’m more comfortable in my sexual endeavors. (Like I said he’s super straight. But loves me. And he lets me be totally gay to him in the bedroom 🥴) 
I’m more confident in my every day life with just changing socially. I’m taking everything else slow. I’ve got kids and ones 8 who is not taking it well. He’s not transphobic he just loves women so it makes him upset I’m not going to be one anymore. Like legit he said he wouldn’t care if my husband became a women lol I hope he learns that this is better for us and that one day it won’t bother him. 
I know my husband will be upset when I lose the boobs and my butt is hairy 😂 but I said he could do this enlargement thing for his dingaling. He’s excited for it so I think it will help soften the blow
LMAOOO I love your husband man
Your son sounds really cute, I'm sure as he grows and with the right education and explaining of what being trans is like he'd understand! I wish you the best in life <3"	xr3uf9	trans	926	0.99	2022-09-29 10:05:57
First time in public in girl clothes		"Hugs you look great!  The first few times are terrifying but exciting!   But the perfect steps to being yourself 💜
Looking fantastic! You totally pass, plus your hair and make up are beautiful!
looking fabulous! so proud of you, well done!
Do you have a cheat code I don't know about! Holy moly!
Looking cute!
So brave! And so pretty ☺️☺️☺️
Your a doll😍
You look beautiful 😍
Adore 😍
😍😍 wow
oh you're really cute; and that's a really flattering hairstyle
Is your voice feminine?
Beautiful!!!
Courageous and very pretty indeed
Good luck you look great 😊
You look awsome enjoy your clothes and time in public as yourself
You looks really good! Hope you're enjoying :3
you certainly pass! Very cute!
This popped up on my ""popular feed"" scrolling offline on my phone. Hopped on my PC just to say that I genuinely thought you were naturally a woman.
[removed]
Thank you, it was a great experience it really helped
Thank you, I’m always worried about passing, no one gendered me while I was out. Probably because my voice is pretty male like.
Nope just practice really and taking inspiration from people you like
Not much I’m still working on it
Thank you that’s so flattering
Haha I actually didn’t use it
You totally pass 1000%! You’re really stunning!
Looks like I'll be taking some inspiration from you!
Can you explain how?
Ignore her she's a jealous cnt that's insecure about her appearance. 

She comments passive aggressive things about people's appearance in trans and lgbtq+ spaces
Just watching voice tutorials on YouTube, no one knows I’m trans yet so I don’t have any official training
Thank you for the heads up
I really want to be a trans female but my years and country I live won't let me that. Still didn't tell anybody that I came out because I'm scared of discrimination
No problem I hate transphobes. She also called another trans woman Chrischan. She's really scummy
Yeah that’s not nice"	uuszvl	trans	910	0.99	2022-05-21 18:28:25
It is 80° F today and I have almost zero summer clothes please send help the heat is killing me (MtF 4 months HRT)		"Looks cute but I imagine it was hot with tights
Nebraska weather is weird AF
Second outfit is perfectly fine.
If the flannel is lightweight, slightly rolled sleeves and a bit tied up from the bottom can be cute and stylish. It also works with a blouse, tank or tee underneath.
Maybe invest in fishnets or ripped tights if that’s a style? Might give you some air to breathe.
Rarely ever gets that warm here. Feel for you.
One word for you cutie…sundresses! 😁👍
Speaking from Australia, take the tights and denim jacket off and feel good!
You’re so cute!!!!
me, who went out in an Eskimo coat for days during ""the hottest summer in 40 years"" : cowqrd
My closet is immense and overflowing. I would love to help you out if I can so send me your measurements and I will see what I can find that I am willing to pass along to you. After you see what I have you can decide if you want them or not.
Omg cutie you gotta grab a friend and go thrifting!
Very hot here in Missouri as well
You must be in LA bc it's hot AF here too.
That second outfit is very cute. That skirt can go with basically any top, which makes it nice.
I feel you! I started transitioning about 2 months ago and already the changing weather is having me fill out my wardrobe lol
I love the sleeveless short dresses I get from Old Navy along with a short bamboo slip from Amazon.
Just a thought. Walmart usually has some cute things, sundresses etc., usually very cheap. It’s a good start. You can get 7 or 8 dresses for usually under $100.
Oh noooo I’ll be right there with you soon 😭
Haha this whole winter was the same thing but on Opposite Day for me. I was like “it’s snowing! And I moved here from a desert I only own t-shirts help!! T_T”
It's been flipping from 65 to 15 below every other week in spokane.
Oh, yeah, Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma have had very severe weather changes this year.
Southern Idaho (where I used to live) would get regularly down to 5 F during winter and 120 during summer.
Dang, I live in florida and it was like around 45 degrees out.
No that's okay! I don't need anything like that. I'm really just looking for suggestions is all. I've never had hot weather while I've been out as female so I just have no idea what to do or what looks good
got cold for my camping trip, then immediately warmed up
In Kansas it was 10 degrees a couple days ago, and now it's in the 80s
Okay. Good luck with that I guess. I could send you pics of what I have done in the past if that interests you.
It's short shorts and tanks for me when it's hot.
It has been cold for every one of my days off, and warm when I work, for like 2 weeks and it is starting to piss me off. Lol"	t58mr5	trans	908	0.99	2022-03-02 19:55:19
I slip up once and BAM! Transphobia!	"So admittedly I messed up , I had ordered some bras off Amazon and they said they were supposed to come by the end of this month to September and I was pretty chill with it. What I didn't expect is for them to come early and unfortunately my grandfather got it and gave it to my mother. Now, I was just expecting my mom to pass it off and say "" be more aware next time"" or "" you know how he feels about this. Just be careful next time"" but no, she blew it out of the ballpark today ( not in a good way) she wanted to act dumb and act like she didn't know what was inside the package when she could clearly feel that it was bras. I was a little embarrassed still about this whole bra thing so I kind of just sheepishly said another article of clothing until eventually a bra. Now my mom had been very supportive of me but she had her little slip ups and I was close to calling her transphobic but I had to remind myself that me coming out as trans was pretty new and it would take some time. But it's been a year and a few months now and the thing she told me literally ruined my entire day. Well, it's still fresh in my mind as it happened a few minutes ago. I'll tell you what she said word for word ""Look Man, you got to stop ordering stuff like this online. You know how he feels about this and you are just asking for conflict"", this hurt me a bit because I thought we finally were out of understanding of my identity but she wouldn't even further and said ""There are real women who need stuff like this and it's being wasted on you"" That cut deep like it actually hurt. And now I'm just classifying my mother as a full-on transphobe. I was hesitant about cutting her off along with my grandparents but screw it, she's shit too . I guess I am going to be alone with no family when I move. I hate this shit so much"	"I’m sorry but … how do they know what clothing items you get? Do they „feel“ the bag or what? That‘s just sooo creepy. o.0  
Also, it‘s not like you‘re stealing the clothes from some homeless kid. C‘mon.     

Y‘know what, as a trans guy you can tell her next time I gave you my *bra buying licence*. Please use it, because I hate that stuff. Balance achieved! XD
wow 😕. hoping you make it out of there & find people better fit to be your family
I'm dreading coming out to my family. I only just last night came out to my wife. She knew I was questioning, but the realization hurt her. She ""married a man"" and ""wants her husband back.""

It sucks.

That said, in your case, I'm guessing you need the bra to feel complete. I know without my little tastes of gender euphoria, I probably would have off'd myself already.

Sending lots of love! ♥️♥️♥️
Theres so many people who need oxygen and your parents are wasting it
 The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water or the womb. Chosen family all the way. I wish you the best of luck finding awesome friends to surround yourself with, people worthy of your trust and care.
I’m usually ok reading posts about transphobia, but man, this one just hurt to read.

I’m so sorry, OP.  Sending you love girl 💗
[deleted]
Taking clothes from someone who needs it?  Is she even aware of how much shit goes in a landfill every day?  What a fucking stupid thing to say - ah yes, all those cisgender women who don’t have any bras because trans women are buying up all the stock.  Not like companies adjust their output based on demand or anything!
Actually, buying things even if you don't ""need"" them causes demand, which increases supply. You're literally supporting bra companies buy purchasing bras.


And as a trans guy, I know how important gender affirming clothes are. Clothes are a necessity. You do need them. It's not like you're going to Walmart and buying out the entire bra section.


Your mother is indeed a transphobe.
Businesses operate on supply and demand. Your purchasing of any clothing is based on a company's projected supply needs for that time and as such you are in no way depriving anyone of their bust support needs. 

Also the online market allows for a degree of anonymity and convenience that you find beneficial to you as a consumer.

You also, as a member of a 'free'  society have the ability to choose where your finances go, clothes,  boots,  motorcycles,  etc.  To deny you this denies you the basic financial autonomy that is fundamental in the operation of the economy.

Furthermore your parent may find that their ratio of poo to head is currently in a state of more poo than head. Thereby making them, by all measurable accounts, a poo head.

In all seriousness I hope you can find a degree of freedom and peace in your current situation until life opens up to you. Furthermore I hope that you recurve the respect you are due, if not now than soon.
It’s not wasted on you. You have just as much right to buy clothes as anyone else. 

You are valuable, and your desires matter.
To be fair, since the Bra Wars of '06, they have been in incredibly short supply.
Yeah screw her. There are worse things than having no contact to your family, trust me. Go away and build up your own family and surround yourself with people that have your back.
I get to come out to 4 adult children. I am dreading it. I have to wait till my daughter marries in October. She has mental issues. I have been on hrt for 11 months. It's getting more and more difficult to live a double life mentally. It sucks.
Listen, Miss, I’m sorry your day went so terribly. I hope you were still able to wear and enjoy your purchases and that you felt as beautiful as you are. Your family will come around, and if they don’t, it doesn’t change that you’re absolutely wonderful and absolutely deserving of love and acceptance. (and bras!)
uuuuuh. you are a real woman. and thats not how consumerism works so shes wrong twice. i know it can be tough for parents sometimes (nb here) but theres no excuse for saying shit like that— things that are Meant to hurt. im sorry she said that shit and hope she didnt hurt you too bad
Fuck them then you can make your own family of friends
You are a real women that’s bs
I’m sorry she’s being shitty toward you.

But also if I it helps, what she’s saying is hilariously dumb. “Women who need stuff like this?” Lmao does she know bras don’t provide any medical benefit unless you’ve got a massive bust that gives you back pain at which point you may as well just consider getting reductions instead??! Literally the only reason for bras under a DD cup (to be charitable) is societal pressure to conform to wearing bras or personal preference.

She’s definitely transphobic, but she also clearly doesn’t even understand cis women. A 30-300 dollar semi comfortable at best piece of fabric society tells women “it supports them” is what is a waste to begin with. If it eases your dysphoria, you have a more legitimate use than any cis woman your cup size.
You didn't slip up.  It's not your responsibily to control how he feels about anything.

You ordered perfectly normal clothes.  You did NOTHING wrong.

The only people making this weird are them.
Not all females even choose to wear a bra. There are plenty for you.
The “real women” who need bras are you. Bras are not purely to hold up bags of flesh; they have an emotional tie to them. They can make you feel euphoric and are very pretty to boot. If I wasn’t trans masc I would wear the heck out of them just because they can be colorful and fun! Your family sounds like a real work in progress; I’m really sorry for that. Took me a while to get my family to accept me and I’m still working on it a year later as things change. I’ve cut off lots of people so far, family, friends, friends of friends, etc. The process never gets easier, but understanding that it is for your benefit in the long run keeps me going. Why keep people around when they always make you feel like sh*t? For now, I think it’s amazing you are still willing to put up with your family. You have a big heart; must be a trans thing. Really hope your bras fit and look good!
Seems to me there are real allies that could be using that air and she's wasting it
I’m really sorry about that :( I hope things get better! 🫂
No! ….I hurt with you. This sucks.
I'm alone too. Or I will be very very soon. I'm moving out of state in the next few weeks, and I'll be going full no-contact with my parents and siblings. I'm already NC with the rest of my extended family. And if I'm being real, I've felt alone for years already despite still having a ""relationship"" (for lack of a better term) with my family. 

Family by blood is vastly overrated. 

Soon it'll be just my dog and me. Here's to hoping I figure out how to makes friends in a new place.

Sending you love, OP. <3
Ah yes, the great under-reported bra shortage. Whatever will the rEaL wOmEn do? /s
What's more important? Gramps who'll probably be dead soon (or in a home, or have dementia, etc) or your child being comfortable and able to buy their own shit? 

Seriously, there legitimately shouldn't be an issue whatsoever, Gramps doesn't need to know a damn thing, especially about you ordering stuff for yourself. More so if you're using your own money too. They have zero say what you do with your own damn money. 

To avoid this in the future, it might be worth looking into opening a PO box, since then only you can have access to your own mail. I got one and it was like, $80 for nine months I think? 

I sincerely hope you can get out of that situation though, the whole thing sounds toxic as hell, and nobody deserves that.
I’m so sorry you went through that. None of that is acceptable. You have a right to a bra just as much as any other woman, and repeatedly misgendering you on top of that was absolutely not cool. Sending love. ♥️
The real woman comment is so weird and it seems like it was said intentionally to hurt you. Like there are a shortage of bras on Amazon or in the US um what lol
I'm sorry OP, you deserve better.
I'm sorry you had to go through that :( I'm absolutely not going to try to convince you not to drop her, you don't owe her another chance but if it's important to you that she's in your life I will say this - I have a whole list of family members I'm cutting out of my life once I'm old enough to leave, what I didn't expect was my grandma to make it off of that list. She's always been very religious and against all lgbtq, when I came out she was very transphobic and refused to use the right name and pronouns and constantly made invalidating comments, it's been almost 2 years now and she doesn't use my pronouns much but she uses my name, she corrects herself when she calls me girl, she puts my preferred name and pronouns and my true identity if asked for on things such as medical forms and school stuff, she said she would buy me a giant octopus stuffed animal (smth I've always wanted bc I love octopi) when I get top surgery, she buys me clothes from the men section, she got upset when she found out my mom told me I need to be put in a mental hospital for being trans, she watches shows with lgbtq characters in it with me and she doesn't roll her eyes or make offensive comments anymore, she just sees us as people now & not some horrible sin. Overall she's come a long way and I'm very happy, I hope one day the mistakes of calling me a girl will stop and she'll start using my pronouns more, but I'm willing to be patient considering how much she's grown so far :) my point is, your mom could definitely change and grow and learn, I can't make any promises and not everyone will change like my grandma has, but there's a chance. You don't have to give her that chance if it's too much to handle, that's completely valid and understandable, but if you do I just want you to know there is hope <3

my mother still hasn't used the right pronouns for me as far as I know but she called me Tyler a couple times (I don't live with her so I'm not sure if she talks about me with my real name more when I'm not around or not) and when her bfs kids were mocking me being trans she got so pissed off bc they were making me uncomfortable and she accidentally broke a bowl bc she slammed smth down, honestly it felt good to finally feel like my mom believes that I'm trans and sees how it effects me when ppl are transphobic, she also talked to her bf about how disrespectful his kids were being and said she wants me to feel safe and comfortable in her home.

My brother actually outted me, I technically didn't come out. He pretended to be supportive, he would call me brother, but when he called me he/him his tone sounded like he was mocking me, and I overheard him making fun of me and saying it's just a stupid phase (that was a little over a year ago) but now (as far as ik) he's genuinely supportive, he always calls me Tyler, he tries to use he/him for me he messes up sometimes bc he was used to using she/her around transphobic family members for a while, but he always uses the right terms around his friends, which I rlly didn't expect bc his friends seemed like they'd bully me. Turns out I was wrong, ig you can't judge someone before you get to know them. Once he was otp with a friend and he asked who he was with and my brother told him ""my brother and gf"", another time I was talking to him while he was on a game and his friend asked if that's his sister talking, he said ""no that's my brother"", I met one of his friends recently (I knew him when I was a kid), he said ""oh is that your sister?"" And my brother said ""That's Tyler"" his friend casually apologized and complimented my hair :)) I even saw his messages with his gf once (bc he was messaging her on my phone and didn't exit out of it) and he was using my correct name and pronouns, it felt good bc for a long time I thought he only used them when I was around and when I could hear and it was all performative, but that made me realize that isn't true :)


My Aunt had argued with me about whether she was transphobic or not before (she was) and how ppl just have ""different beliefs"" but later on she bought me a pride bracelet and had it sent to my house as a surprise, she added a little note that said ""I love you Simon"" (Simon was my preferred name at the time.)

My dad never rlly showed signs he'd be transphobic but also never any signs he'd be supportive so I rlly didn't know how he'd react, I'd gone by different names before when I identified as non-binary and he always smiled, hugged me, and used that name, and same with when I went by Simon (more masculine, more obvious that I'm a trans guy) I never officially told him I'm trans, but it still felt nice.


They've all come a long way (my mom's still iffy tbh, she just recently kinda started to understand) and I'm so glad I gave them the opportunity to change. Truthfully I probably wouldn't have if I had been old enough to leave.

Not all families come around, but I never in a million years thought that mine would, so hopefully this helps someone :)
Next time you buy something like that on Amazon, I suggest you download Deliveries Package Tracker by oRRs. Just input the tracking number / Amazon login details (login is needed for packages delivered by Amazon Logistics and not something like FedEx or USPS) and leave instructions saying to leave it somewhere you can find. If USPS is delivering your package, just go to the postal office holding it and get it. Taking these steps could help you transition without taking shit from anyone. Sorry you're going through this OP, I hope your family comes around and changes their minds.
It will take time. All these things change over time and consistency. Definitely clarify how you feel and how difficult it already is for you.
Id be like “Look Man, i can buy what I want. I am a woman and no matter what you say or think that will never change, so you might as well get fucking used to it” “Bitch”
Don't waste your breath on rotten people like that. They never supported you and its obvious from your quotes.
I am so sorry. And this is cold comfort I know, but now you know where they stand.

I wish there were no way for you to “mess up;” I wish it were just okay.
woman's acting like there's a bra shortage lmao what a cunt

fuck em all, you'll thank yourself for cutting them off unfortunately. this fucking sucks i hope it gets better soon
As someone who used to sell thrift clothes, this is total BS.

Literal tons of clothes get wasted everyday simply because they're 'out of style' and undergarments are definitely no exception.

People change size, personal taste, and preferred textiles by the day. There's always MORE than enough for everyone!
You are a real woman, if you use the bras they aren’t wasted on you. Don’t let her ignorance drag you down 💜
I don't tend to get super mad at transphobic stories on here, but this genuinely riled me up. ""A real woman could use it"" she can fuck right off with that sort of attitude, you are a real woman,  and she is seriously gonna be losing out big once you move out. You are worth the effort, you're an amazing woman, you are valid. It is absolutely her loss to alienate herself from such a beautiful daughter just because she can't get over herself.
This really hurt me to read and I am crying right now. Just remember, your chosen family will always support you sister.
I was going to said to you that there is not big deal until the last quote...
Wtf it's not like bra are a limited ressource... if you buy one you fuel a market and on a very small scale you incentivise someone to make one cheaper.
Stay strong op
I didn’t realize that bras were on allocation and that only some women deserved them. I guess she should donate all her bras to those in need since she is an ass of a person. Let nice people have them and she can do without.

I hope you are able to get away and be safe soon.
People say “look man” as a generic reference and isn’t something to really care about tbh lol
“There are real women who need stuff like this”

Bitch, the fuck?? That was unfathomably rude. Hope you’re okay
You should talk to your mother about it. She obviously doesn’t get it and needs a kick in the ass. Cause seriously what if you called her not a real woman? She’d be heavily offended! It’s the same shit! You can’t be sheepish about it either. I know it sucks but you need to sit your mom down with staunch intentions of telling her what she did and how it hurt you and that she owes you an apology. Furthermore you need to have more conversations about gender. Explain it literally every way you can until she gets it. If she can’t get it then just ask her to sympathize and support you. Also your mom is just dead wrong about the bras they’re not even that good for your boobs and basically every woman already has one at least.
You are a real woman. And there’s no shortage of bras. Your mom is just using everything as an excuse to be a bigot. And it will take time, but you will find a family that you choose and will love you for you.
Cut her brakes, they're for 'real drivers' only anyway. Joking aside, this sucks, sending hugs. <3
Those clothes aren't being ""wasted"" on you, you are a real woman and you do, in fact, need those clothes. Your need for them isn't any less than someone else's. I'm sorry your mom is a transphobe, but you're a wonderful, beautiful woman and nothing she has to say can change that. <3
I just… 

Okt, first, I’m so sorry your mom’s transphobic and hiding behind your grandfather. You deserve to accepted by your family. 

That said, I almost have to laugh at this, because your mom thinks you should give up being a woman because *there’s a bra shortage??*

As if capitalism doesn’t overproduce in the extreme. As if the difficulty in (some) breast-having people’s access to bras is a lack of resources, rather than the expense due to the demand for ever growing profits for business owners and shareholders.

It’s like she couldn’t think of a better argument than “there are starving children in Africa” and just tried to crossapply it to bras. 

I can’t even. That’s so ridiculous.
From one real woman to another, you deserve all the bras!!!
Well I want to guess that she didn't genuinely know but at the same time I feel like she did know. But the fact that she wanted to know was kind of out of character for her at this point. Also I've had tons of moments for my mother just straight up doesn't see me as a trans woman and still sees me as her son.
Yeah, when I buy binders I just tell whoever I’m living with (if they deem to ask) that it’s underwear. It’s not a lie and none of them have been weird enough to demand a look so it’s worked out pretty well.
What an awesome guy you are! 👏👏👏
Same I don't need my bra licence any more and my dress licence and my long hair licence and my girl shit licence
Thanks, I'm just tired at this point
[deleted]
Thank you, I got this mostly because of that and because my breast were getting bigger and I wanted to be a bit more courteous and not have my boobs Just poking out at people
Agree 100%. For the last 35 years, my circle of friends since high school has remained tight (as have all significant others and kids). We even vacation together at every opportunity ... it's almost 40 people.

They are my family. Most of my relatives do nothing but bicker and talk behind each other's backs. And I know my mother is not going to be supportive when I come out once doing so is safe.

So I'll have my daughter and my friend-family. That's all I need.
This.
Thank you so much, I had to take a nap to just sleep off all the anger I felt but I'm so glad to see messages like this
Yeah that's something that her and her father are horribly notorious for. I picked up on their gaslighting earlier on in my transition. My mother when told me I should've saved my sperm to have grandkids and tried to guilt trip and manipulate me into stopping HRT and doing a sperm collection thing.
Yeah, I'm just now starting to realize that I was pretty dumb. But I'm also starting to realize she used to excuse for a large amount of things like when she took me out the pick out clothes she would tell me to put them back because ""a real girl could use them'
...did you just make a Terminator 2 reference? :D
Thank you so much, it was starting to get to me a few hours ago too. I was so confused and hurt thinking it was wasted on me.
They should be more grateful, a lot of good people died for their country in the Bra Wars.
I feel you but I even fear for you. I can't imagine coming out to children, I've heard so many horror stories about it. I hope everything goes well, I give my best wishes
It hurt a bit because I've been trying to have a good relationship with my mother because I want her to be the last person I could depend on transwise but it hurt me so bad that I had to take a nap to really think and kind of sleep off all the anger, confusion, and hurt I had.
Exactly, and besides the reason why I'm wearing it is because I want to be more courteous and also because since my breasts are getting bigger it's kind of awkward to just have them out
Thank you, I've been getting serious lately about Gtfo of here. After I recover from  COVID, it's on!
Damn my reply is longer than the original post 😃 sorry abt that 😭
I know but some part of me wanted to give them a chance since they were family. But now I'm starting to realize that family doesn't really matter if they don't really respect you. But again I wanted to give them a chance and now I see I can and it really does hurt.
Yeah, I hate reality sometimes because it's something I can't control and sometimes that's something may hurt me. This definitely did
Nah she has very heavy emphasis on the man part, I can understand it if it was just ""look man"", ""look dude"" but nah she put too much emphasis on that one, also it was the way she looked at me while saying it is what gave it away
Funny thing is she told me she wanted me to have a license by the end of the month because I need to start driving instead of ""wasting my money""
That‘s harsh, sorry OP. :-/  
Hey maybe they‘ll change their views? Many cis folks seem to ease up once people transition (if you want that).
Ask her then why shes buying them?
Go find people who *actually* understand you. Maybe one day, your mom will come around, but if she doesn't, that *says nothing* about you as a person just because *she* chose to be transphobic.

I don't know about this concept as it pertains to being trans honestly (I'm still closeted) but some family are the people you want to keep with you through life and some are the type you need to slap an NFPA diamond on and dump only at a chemical waste processing facility 'cause they are *toxic.*

Edit: Also, *why are they opening your mail? So they have something new to baselessly gaslight and guilt-trip you over? Super cool of them.*
My wife has told me around a year mark, “hey honey you have a really breasts popping out of your shirt, you probably need some bra”. 😀 Until then I’ve not wore any bra and now I’m wearing only sports bra.
That's super fucked up.  Your reproductive decisions are none of her fucking business.
>  ""a real girl could use them'

“I agree, that’s why I picked them!”
Wow.  Yeah she doesn’t respect you.
wtf it's not like there's a clothing shortage
:D
You matter just as much as everyone else. I wish you the best of luck. 

I ran from my family when I was old enough for different reasons, and the space has helped us all get along better. 

Also: the family I have made for myself since leaving home is far more supportive than my blood family. There is hope, and you can do it. :)
honestly that's so fair and pretty good coping mechanism too. i really hope things get better and she stops being that way. no one deserves to be treated that way
You'll be OK Hun I just wouldn't respect or listen to any more of their opinions. They obviously don't respect or listen to any of yours.
Oh wow, sorry to hear that. If it makes you feel any better you have my support, maybe it's not much coming from an internet stranger but I believe in you. If you buy something with your own money it's your own business and nobody else's. Hope your mom learns to cope with you making your own choices. You're going to make it, that's for sure.
Well I've been beginning to transition, with the obvious case being my chest and then finding out about me taking my pills in secret. But yeah I think I just need to come out fully and just own it
Not so Funny thing is even before I was trans she kept saying she wanted grandbabies and everything. There was one time she made it all about grandbabies for no good reason and she kept asking me uncomfortable questions and kept telling me to ""be a man"" when I was saying how I was uncomfortable about the questions
this
Yeah I understand now. I really do
You should! I encourage every trans person to live their life as their true self as fast as possible. You do NOT want to be on your deathbed wishing you had come out earlier. Own it. You are you. All this bullshit that society tells us about ourselves is dead wrong and they do it because they’re trying to kill us! Being trans is a punk experience! Fight the power! Be yourself! And don’t ever ever ever sacrifice your own well being and your LITERAL PIPELINE TO HAPPINESS AND FULFILLMENT for some notion of “peace” in your family. It’s not fucking worth it. Be you. Own it. If your family can’t handle it then show them how wrong they are. You’re just a girl, sis. Ain’t nothing wrong with being a girl.
In any case I wish you good luck and strong nerves!
I really don't understand parents' entitlement over wanting grandchildren.  They had their children and raised them, let your kids make their own choices about if they want their own children or not, and respect their decisions.  Jesus Christ.
You'll be okay hun. We're all here for you 😊
Damn Sis, i love this anarchist vibe. I want to burn my bra with you...but i just bought em and i'd feel naked without them. So...how about coffee? Love the energy!
Thank you so much
Yeah I know my family is obsessed with babies like the moment I turn 17 they kept telling me how I needed to start acting like a man so that a woman would get with me because no woman would get with me with the way I was acting which wasn't anyway because I really didn't have a personality. I just mostly stayed in my room because I was afraid.
Thank you so much"	wv4i5u	trans	909	0.98	2022-08-22 20:38:43
Why are people in media more afraid of mtf than ftm?	Especially regarding bathrooms and clothing they always seems to have more of an issue than one or another	"because in transphobes minds, especially TERFs, trans men are victims, and trans women are predators.
It’s just 2 different types of transphobia —- trans women are seen as predatory and trans men are seen as irrelevant/nonexistent
Because you surely “can’t take women seriously” even when they “pretend to be men”. But “men who challenge masculinity” must not be! Outrage…blah blah 😑
Because trans women destroy their concept of men being the dominant gender. Because, ""why would anyone give up being a man to be a woman?"" It literally breaks their minds.
they have a worldview where they see men as predators and women as prey. so they they see ftms as women that have been “tricked” by the woke agenda or whatever and mtfs as men trying to enter women’s spaces to assault or “erase” women or something
Sexism. Transmen are just helpless misguided women in need of rescuing from trans ideology.
Ah Ok I kinda understand it a bit better now. Thank you 😺
I heard it on tik tok explained by a transmasc, and it makes sense. 
Everyone is right here. 
Trans women break cis aggressive straight men minds and are seen as predators. 
Trans men are infantilized and seen as victims
They think Trans women are men in dresses grooming children while Trans men are just confused women, and women are always harmless.
It's because the phobes see trans women as ""predatory men pretending to be women,"" and trans men as ""silly little girls trying to get power."" According to the bigots, masculinity is good, while femininity is bad. Them seeing ""men"" trying to disown their masculinity to ""become"" women is seen as wrong by them, but seeing ""women"" ""move up the ranks"" is seen as good. It's honestly a disgusting thought process. Just keep living as a trans person or ally, so we can slowly but surely stop this awful thought process.
Because they want to sell that trans men are small confused women who need help and that trans women are big scary men who will hurt someone, they use the patriarchy and harmful stereotypes to create more, even more harmful, and untrue stereotypes.
Because transphobes (esp terfs) see trans women as men, and all men are predators in their mind so trans women are evil. trans men are either non existent in their mind or poor little girls, victims of society’s sexism
Because the current discourse is that men are evil, don't you know? It's misandry to the max. And if trans women are former men, TERFs believe they are still beholden to all the shit they already think about cis men. But trans men are the opposite, and are really victims pulled into a delusion about male privilege.

I'm exhausted.
cause of penises
Because straight cis men aren't afraid of ""*accidentally* fucking another dude"" if the person they're with is already representing as a man.

The key is the ""accidental"", not the possibility of being aroused by another man. It's the whole ""how dare you put me in a position where I have to think about WHY *you*'re arousing *me*.  The cis men who are straight and homophobic don't want to have to think about whether or not the person they're undressing in their mind might have a penis or some other part that formerly was one.
I'm a cis male.  From my time in the navy, I can tell you.  Macho men are terrified of a challenge to their masculinity.  If they feel ""tricked"" by being legitimately attracted to a trans woman,  they will be chastised by their peers.  And the media is run by men.

Edit: The fear of trans women become a hate of trans women.
Some men can't wrap their head around the fact that they just might be attracted to someone with the same genitals, they think about what they want to do to women and therefore assume the position of ""this is what I'd do in a womens locker room so obviously that's what you're trying to do too."" And, ""I can't be placed in a position where I might hit on someone that was once male because I can't be bothered to question my own sexuality."" Flip side, ""Meh, lesbians are inherently hot so FTM doesn't even cross my radar."" Just what I've witnessed, not my opinion.
I guess since they see trans men as women they aren’t as threatened. My only guess is they see a trans women living her life and are just threatened by their agab. They have so many stupid ideas about how people with certain genitalia should act.
Because transphobic people believe that every man out there only does anything in order to get access to sexual partners, thus a ""man"" becoming a woman is doing it to gain access to women to have sex with.

This is why they ignore straight trans women so often too, many TERFs even have said they consider trans women with men as gay men who have fallen victim to comphet.
Its an extension of sexism. In their minds women are weak creatures who need protection and only exist to churn out more men. While men are supposed to be superior to women. To them transmascs were lured into transness by the desire to escape their sad destiny to pump out (preferably white) babies. On the other hand the idea someone who was born on the top of the social ladder deliberately climbing down must have malicious intentions and since they are lower and cant churn out babies they are worth less than nothing.
Edit: sorry for the essay i feel very strongly about this
Because they see us as our AGAB. And they are also sexist. So man is a threat and dangerous and woman is  fragile, weak and innocent. Also gender roles for men are way more strict. So it's easier to be ""masculine woman"" than ""feminine man"". 

Men go to toilet to pee and shit. Women act like public toilet were their personal living room.  They go to toilet to hang out, make up, gossip, take selfies etc. Men don't look each other in the toilet so they most likely don't notice if you don't fully pass. Women are very territorial and aggressive. Also it is that sexist idea that women need ""safe space"" in ""men's world"" because they are weak and fragile. 

I don't think many people are truly afraid. It's same as with female sports. Most of people couldn't care less. And that debate of trans lesbians. Those same people hate cis lesbians. But they know they have lost the war against gay people so they're willing to use anything they can to make our live harder.
They see trans women as men threatening cis women, but don't consider trans men to be women threatening cis men.
Cishet men are afraid of finding a trans woman attractive. If they do, it invalidates their  preconceptions and makes them confront their own gender/sexual identities. They see us as deceivers, sirens beckoning sailors to their demise. I couldn’t imagine being so insecure about my identity that I need to actively hate a group of people who are really only seeking what everyone else in this world is seeking: happiness, contentment, and peace of mind. Cisgendered people take for granted that their perception of their own gender rarely, if ever, is discordant with their assigned gender. If they could all feel that for one day, there’s be so much more support for us. Transphobes are so fragile that if they even consider an identity that does not fit into their narrow definition of gender, it might cause theirs to crack a little. They’d rather erase us from society instead of finding deeper understanding of themselves. This is not me saying they’d all become transgender, most of them wouldn’t, but they would be a lot more understanding and happier people.
Misogyny. Women are stereotyped as fragile and needing protection and are already wary of men. This makes it easier for conservative talking heads to fearmonger and manipulate them.
The lovely combo of transphobia and misogyny.
It’s because they have zero empathy, so they see trans women as men. And they know damn well that men are dangerous, so therefore fear trans women.
Idk I always thought it was the other way around
They hate us
Because as a mtf, you are purposely taking a step back in society out of your own free will. And that takes courage, that's what scares people the most.

That's just my point of view
In the minds of transphobes, trans women = men, and trans men = women, so trans women are scary and threatening men, and trans men are just confused little girls. Transphobes suck.
Transmasc men have both a curse and a blessing in being much less visible.

They don’t get to see themselves represented, which *sucks* as they deserve to see themselves, they do t get their issues taken seriously, which likewise sucks.

But are attacked less often.
Because ftm are just “playing dress up”
It’s about control. And controlling women more specifically. So men that are women, appear to be weak to men.
Extreme sexism on both ends. They don't see trans men as men, so they're clearly all the helpless, delusional victims of trans ideology. They don't see trans women as women, so they're clearly deceptive, aggressive men with a fetish.
The terf movement is picking up and they want to defend the “helpless poor women” or something weird like that. It all just goes back to gender stereotypes and misogyny
I just figured that since theyre obsessed with trans genitals, and penises are more intimidating-looking
Because in their minds ftm are women and women can't hurt people according to them, unless when they want to use cases of women who beat men just to ""destroy"" feminism
A lot of transphobia is based in misogyny. Women are seen as helpless, weak, and needing protection. Since transphobes see trans men as women, they aren't a threat. Instead, they are painted as easily influenced, confused girls who think they need to be like men to escape traditional femininity or feel special. Conversely, trans women are considered to be men. Men are thought to be more powerful, and masculine qualities more valuable. Misogynists can't understand why a man with more power would lower themselves to the role of a women. They are seen as predatory, a threat not just to women but the worldview of the misogynist.
Heya, thanks for asking the question.

 CIS straight woman here, what kills me about the media is that it feels like another way to put down women and pit woman against woman.

It strikes me as a new form of misogyny and and I'm really sorry that my trans sisters bodies are being put in the line. It's also a really dark way of telling women in general what defines us.
It is an extension of misogyny. Toxic masculinity doesn't see any afab as a threat regardless of what they do, but an amab who defies gender stereotypes is perceived as a threat to all men. MTF bear the brunt of the assault because they defy masculinity completely, but it is also extended to a lesser extent to male nurses, male housekeepers,  home makers, and other men who pursue less masculine roles.
In their minds, male = strong and female = weak. So then ftm is “moving up in the world” and they don’t understand why a mtf would want to “pervert” their masculinity. The media has portrayed trans women as deceptive for decades, and conservative politicians play off of this narrative in order to create a moral panic about “men” trying to sexually assault women in the bathroom and trying to take over women’s sports, in turn rallying conservatives to vote for them
as of current, there's two major groups of transphobes: the ultraconservative/christo-fascist type (think matt walsh, ben shapiro) and the terfs (graham linehan, joanne, ...). these ideologies start out in pretty different places, but their reasons why trans women seem scarier than trans men kind of converge.

for the former, what they want is tradition/their interpretation of christian values. meaning women stay at home and take care of their children while the men work, with men having all the power. anything queer cannot exist in their ideal world as that'd be sinful to them. so they can paint trans women as scary - they're strong men who want to attack their weak women! - but the opposite argument for trans men doesn't work as a woman isn't a danger to men, women are weaker and powerless after all. that's why their narrative around trans men usually focusses on detransitioners and generally mourning those ""young women"" losing their ability to bree^(eeeeeeeeeeee)d.

terfs, instead, start out from the worldview a lot of second wave feminists have - men are the evil oppressors and the problem in society, while women are oppressed, this is how their world works and what defines those two genders. now, this is a gross oversimplification to begin with - it entirely fails to acknowledge the struggles men have due to the patriarchy - but what's relevant here is that this model of the world cannot cope with trans people's existence. 

for trans women, they can't understand why a man would want to give up his privilege and power, so the best explanation they can come up with is that trans women are men that chose a different way of oppressing women - by being bathroom menaces, sauna shockers or whatever else they come up with that week. now again, that explanation can't work with trans men - after all, men are the scary dangerous people and women are the ones who need protection, so like with the christofascists, they can't paint a trans man as a threat, instead choosing to view them as confused lesbians or women attempting to escape their oppression.

TLDR: a lot of ideologies boil down to ""men powerful, women weak"" and with that basis, you can't paint a trans man as a threat to cis men but can paint a trans woman as a threat to cis women.
Because insecure men freak out when they “accidentally” find us attractive
We face just as much violence but we’re seen as in need of fixing please don’t let this post turn into transmascs have it so easy because we don’t
They aren't, they just see us as an easier target
As a ftm it angers me that mtf don't get as much respect
Premeditated hysteria. Misogyny. Cis men in power hate women. (Generalization…whatever.) A trans woman is a slap to manhood. A slap to this unwavering thing that is their identity. Trans men blend in a lot easier. I know some who are stealth through and through cause the got treated like shit.

Bottom line… whatever it actually might be from person to person… Trans women are easy targets.
Right now it’s about prisoners and who gets housed where.
I’ve always thought this. As a trans man, most of the other trans men I’ve met have been bigoted, harassed people, and been just as cruel as a lot of cis men, but I’ve only had one negative encounter with a trans woman, and even then, she detransitioned, so it’s not like that reflects all trans women?
Because bigots see trans men as ""women *pretending* to be men"".

Meanwhile they see trans women as ""men who gave up their privilege and power to play dress-up"".

Therefore they have more respect for trans men because in their eyes, at least they're trying  to be the ""correct"" gender.

TL;DR bigots gonna bigot.
Scare tactics and it’s easier to prey on the (very real and valid) fears of women when it comes to “men” being in their private spaces. It’s gross honestly.
I think it may be because sometimes transwomen don't pass as well. Testosterone effects their voices, gives them an adams apple, changes their face shape, and body build. If they only take hrt a while after male puberty, then although estrogen does a lot, some things won't change unless they get expensive surgeries and train their voices to speak in higher pitch. On the other side, transmen going on hrt end up passing better because their bodies do physically change more, facial hair grows, adams apple appears and voice deepens.

This is obviously not the only reason that transphobia is more towards transwomen but I think it is a considerable factor as ""they are easier to identify"".
misogyny. Some see trans men as confused or tricked lesbians, though some terfs actually support trans men. They cant believe that anybody would want to be feminine since being feminine has been so ostracized in pop culture with terms like ""soyboy"" and in conservative circles is seen as such a bad thing, that they think that trans women dont actually see themselves as/want to be women, and are instead faking it ti gain access to womens spaces and assault them. the whole ""erasure"" theory is a bit of a lighter take on that in that generally people that espouse it have accepted that trans women see themselves as women, but they dont see them as women so they think its problematic an attack on womens rights that trans women get to take a shit in the bathroom, or yknow, exist. While both are quite stupid and harmful to trans women, i think it is important to acknowledge that the whole ""erasure"" idea becoming more popular than the seeing trans women as predators idea *is* a very slight step forward in terms of acceptance, even though it isnt acceptance of trans women in any stretch, and still leads to violence against trans people, and people that believe in it generally still harrass trans people whenever they come across them
TERF ideals I guess (in the UK especially)
Yep we are all predators with mental health problems , apparently a simple visit to psychiatric doctor will fix all our gender issues
because to some we are still women, and god forbid women have the power to be considered a threat
Sexism
They see trans men as women and believe they can control them like they (believe) they can with cis woman. Plus, it's a lot harder to fear mongers against trans men. Most of them probably couldn't find a trans man if they tried.

But for trans women, especially early in transition, it's a little harder for some of us to look fem. Plus, it plays into one of the only groups they are gaining ground with to come after us. But because that group(turfs) actually have no idea what they are talking about, they mostly ignore that teans' men exist, so so do the media.


Edit to add that they do sometime talk about trans men, but I had purged it from my mind because of how insane it sounds. A lot of the talk about trans men is how ""these girls have been tricked into thinking they are boys"" as if afab peps can make a disison about who they are or what they want.
misogyny
sexism says men are stronger than women naturally, transphobia says trans women are men

it's just reporposed sexism, but this time it's disguised as feminism
right wingers hate amab people more than they claim leftists too, that’s the conclusion i’ve come to tbh.
See the Diaclosure Documentary
Because people are stupid and don't understand
Cause we have weenies. And men do more assault than women so they see us as a dangerous group of people. 

It’s also a power thing, men want women to be below them/ sub/ under their control, and a trans woman has the power of a man inside them. We know what’s unjust because we know what full rights used to feel like as men. And then stepping into a female role/ life and seeing the unfairness and sexism causes us to speak up and out about it. That’s my hot take
Because transphobes-specifically TERFs but still-believe that there is a Perpetrator gender and a Victim gender. There's no in-between, and a Perpetrator can't transition into a Victim because they're always going to have the mindset and instincts of a Perpetrator. A Victim *can* transition into a Perpetrator, but then they're horrible nasty gender traitor monsters who deserve to be shot.

A lot of the media focus is on trans women and transfeminine, yes, because to transphobes, having a vagina makes you a Victim and having a penis makes you a Perpetrator, so Perpetrators are 'invading' Victims' spaces and safety, because everyone in the Perpetrator gender is INHERENTLY dangerous and violent and immoral, whereas the people in the Victim gender are all weak and helpless.

But a lot of the legislation surrounding specifically medical transitioning is focused on trans men and transmasculine people, because a trans woman, to these guys, is just a Failed Man. But they can't ever Not Be Men so they can be turned back. They're Perpetrators, like all men, and transphobes believe that you can't un-become a Perpetrator. 

But a trans man is a RUINED Woman, and the right wing-and yes, as far as I'm concerned, if you're a transphobe, you're right-wing-***need*** to control women's bodies, because they're the Victim gender and the Victims must be controlled. They don't want women, especially young girls and teenagers, to 'ruin' their bodies, which means 'becomes unable to become breeding stock'.
Because they don’t see them as women. They see them as predatory men - probably because they can’t imagine biological men *not* being predatory.
You see it most in the bathroom arguments.  Except as soon as one of those bigots sees someone like Buck Angel walk out of the bathroom their daughter is in, there's going to be violence.
Most likely because they still view trans women as men. And therefore, if there's a trans woman (which I don't know how you'd know, but whatever), they still view them as a man (because ""you couldn't possibly actually identify as that""). Also, same thing with viewing them as men, there's the foolish argument that trans women are stronger than regular women, but there are plenty of women stronger than men, and they're still viewed as women.TLDR; they've bigots who aren't willing to change their minds.
Transmisogyny
Bc they see ftm as women taking a wrong path and think we need to be rescued. Its a weird combination of sexism and transphobia I think.
I think people in media may be more afraid of MTF individuals because they often face more discrimination and negative stereotypes in society. This can lead to fear and misunderstanding, which can then be perpetuated in the media. However, it's important to remember that both MTF and FTM individuals deserve equal respect and acceptance. As for the issue of bathrooms and clothing, I believe everyone should have the right to use the bathroom and wear the clothing that aligns with their gender identity, regardless of whether they are MTF or FTM. It's important to create inclusive and safe spaces for all individuals.
misogyny, terf ideology, anything of that sort. they view men as scary and dominant and women need to fight back. since they don't see us as our genders all they see are ""men"" invading women and ""women""  running away to be a man to escape misogyny
They think trans women are predators and “pushing their fetishes onto children” and that trans men are just confused women who are just tomboys in denial ಠ_ಠ
Misogynyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
because we're only confused silly little women /s
Because they infantilise transmen were just women who were too scared to be women and we were manipulated by the woke left into thinking we’re men 🤢
because TERF. Men are evil, women are innocent victims. the gender binary is ""predator and prey"". And since they believe this is an immutable biological fact, they don't see trans women as women and instead view them as men trying to sneak into women's spaces to rape women. 

Trans men on the other hand are confused girls who have been manipulated into mutilating their bodies by the evil trans agenda. 

amab trans people receive demonisation, afab trans people receive infantilisation, and therefore you see more shit about how dangerous trans women are, because the hate afab trans people get tends to be quiet, in the background, but no less debilitating.
Transmisogyny.
A lot of transphobes only experience of male to female people through movies and TV (Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, etc.) In most of those circumstances, there’s always an ulterior motive for the man to pretend to be a woman. It doesn’t cross their mind that there isn’t an underlying motive.
because according to them us trans guys are either irrelevant bc it doesn't back up their argument of trans people being predators, or we're just poor innocent brainwashed babies and 'lost sisters'
Because it fits the masquerade of defending women. 

The core reason that such rampant hatred is even considered is because it's dressed up as protecting women. Using that narrative men are all evil and women are all victims. 

Applying this to Trans people they see Trans women as men (evil) and Trans men as women (victims). So not only do they manage to make trans women and male allies the villains they also solidify their argument that Trans men are just victims of the Trans agenda. 

The simple formula is to speak about a subject noone would dare disagree with, so with JKR you have womens rights and safety, while on the other side like the Sigma male influencers use male mental health. Base the majority of your points on agreeable topics so you can slowly spirnkle in more and more terrible shit. Just like a certain painter in the 1930s when he took up politics.
According to Julia Serano (the trans woman who wrote *Whipping Girl*, a great academic book about trans-feminism), there is nothing scarier for society than someone born male who ""willingly"" gives up their masculine privilege and their dominant place in society. 

And because ppl absolutely want to know the reason why trans women and AMAB enbies would give up their masculinity, they assume the worse (that, for example, trans women transition just to predate on women and children)
The reason imo is rooted in gender stereotypes, sexism and transphobia. There's 2 reason imo:
- ftm are usually more masculine then mtf are feminine. This stems from gender stereotypes, especially regarding bone structure which is more important to appear feminine, while for FtM bodily and facial hair and lower voice are a stronger are the most defining feature of a men, and while testosterone alone has usually great effect in achieving this masculine traits mtf HRT can do little to nothing for the traditional male bone structure, which means that FtM usually pass much more as ""small guys"" (pardon the definition, I know full well that you're beautiful and strong males) and draws much less attention then mtf. It is more difficult for an MtF to appear feminine (for my absolute sadness) and MtF are recognized as ""wolfs in sheep's clothing"" because everybody is used to males being untrustworthy, predators and a danger to females.
- conversily even when an FtM can be easily recognized as being born female the gender stereotype is that the female is innocent and can do no harm, and the FtM is seen as female so it can do no harm. This is also for cis women, mind you, a cis man can never enter a female bathroom but it is acceptable for women to use the men bathroom, especially when they aren't separated in 2 different rooms and the women's is occupied.

I want to point out that I absolutely not condone this stereotypes.

TL;DR: FtM pass better than MtF, and even when they don't the society view women as less dangerous then men.
Because people see ftm as a female who is harmless because they are female. A mtf is seen as not harmless but dangerous because they are male. It's the same way with gay men being seen as dangerous while lesbians are seen as harmless. It is a form of hate based  sex. I don't think there is even a word for it. I  am sorry this exists. I am sorry. Cis 67f
its because trans women are hypervisable, while trans men are invisible.
It's simple misogyny mixed with transphobia I think. Trans men are infantalised and seen as ""confused little girls"", whilst trans women are seen as predators who want to ""pray on little girls"". It's seriously disgusting in both ways.
They are worried about us too, but it is easier to just not acknowledge we exist. The abortion bans affect us. The new testosterone scheduling bullshit affects us. Most of us have the ability to get pregnant and most of us have no interest in doing that, and that is seen as a threat.
Since man are seen as stronger, if a trans man 'invades' man only spaces it's their own choice, but when a trans women goes to women spaces they're inflicting themselves onto other women.

Women are seen as the weaker sex, and man as the stronger. So when someone ""who's naturally stronger invades weaker people's spaces"", they're a danger and should be feared/casted out/banned in the name of self-protection 

It's othering. Othering and fear mongering because the people who say those things don't know any trans women.
Im ln Germany some of us name them Trans Exclusionary Radical Fascist, because they often have links in the far right scene, use right speech terms and the zones between them are really slim and Terfs use a lot of antisemitism dogwhistles or are openly antisemitic.
Because deep down people are all misandrists. They hate men, and see them as inherently violent and aggressive. Not just TERFS, conservatives and rightoids especially, they just think that it's acceptable, while TERFS don't.

It's hard for them to imagine a man doing anything feminine or ""unmanly"" out of the pureness of his heart for them.

To them, men are inherently evil and dangerous and predatory. 

And on the inverse, trans men (who they see as women), are fragile little angels who have been misguided and led astray. Because they see women as creatures with no real autonomy, and also because they want to preserve the breedability of teenage girls.
The anti-trans hate machine attacks us in different ways.

Trans women are demonized as scary dangerous monsters who have to be destroyed, while trans men are infantalized as stupid brainwashed little girls who have to be ""saved"".

They start with the presupposition that nobody really needs to transition.

Because trans women and AMAB nonbinary people are imagined to really be men, they're portrayed as self-directed evil sexual predators who have to be utterly rejected and cast out of society to protect ""real"" (cis) women and girls. And trans women are hyper-sexualized, depicted as being predators threatening cis women on one hand and as being a kinky novelty fuck for cis men on the other.

This combination of sex and danger in public portrayals of trans women gets a lot of page-clicks, which means it gets a lot of attention from news and social media.

Meanwhile, trans men are perceived as lost, confused, vulnerable girls who are only transitioning because we've been brainwashed/groomed/forced into the evil Trans Cult of mutilation and death. We get shit like that disgusting book *""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters"".*

Because we're imagined to really be women we're portrayed as easily manipulated child-like victims who have to be ""saved"" before medical transition ruins us.

And trans men are completely de-sexualized, and dismissed as being somewhere between a butch lesbian and a eunuch. Trans men who have medically transitioned to the point that they are no longer seen as desirable to straight men are seen as ""fallen women""; pathetic, grotesque, ruined females beyond hope of redemption.

We are depicted as being neither threatening nor desirable, and dismissed as pathetic and beneath contempt.
Personally i think most people dont notice ftm.

Women are also more vocal, so hints why you probably see more mtf on any platform :)
And when either of the two are able to go in stealth, conform heavily to gender roles, and are more conventionally attractive than their cis counterparts, god help them if someone finds out they’re trans. Cus then they’ll experience hell on earth for “tricking people.”
TW
It's because they still think that trans men are ""women"", and in their little minds women = weak, or not dangerous at all. it's the opposite with trans women
Because we're more threatening
Like Gen X, the media forgets that Trans men exist.
Visibility, for one thing. Sheer numbers. Plus, stories like Dana Rivers.
I don't think many people take transmen seriously. I'm a trans dude, and many people think we're just playing dress-up. I haven't met anyone who thinks that an evil transguy will do something terrible to a cisman.
Transphobia, misogyny, racism and on and on and on, basically terfs will have a million and one reasons to hate trans women and none of them are valid or make sense to me but I guess I’ll never know because I’m not an ignorant person.
Quite simply, the passing of FtM is simply better. When testo is taken, the person masculinizes very quickly, so that it is no longer visible.
Vagina equals victim, penis equals predator in their simple minds.
This is the answer right here.
Sorry for the dumb question. What is a TERF?
Yup it’s that special combination of misandry and misogyny.  The same people who think trans women are predators think trans men are poor little brainwashed victims.
Or ""lost sisters""
It's the same thing where they were saying gay men were going to assault children but never talked about gay women, as they were just confused. But a guy is afraid of another guy looking at them the way they look at women. 

Their mentality: men want to pretend to be women so they can go into women's  lockers and be pervs. Same with bathrooms. It's bullshit but it comes from ""this is what men are, trans people aren't real, so it must be for evil."" 

A woman pretending to be a man isn't doing it to be a perv, they are doing it to reap the benefit of being a man. So of course there isn't any concern.
Yep they broke the bro code in the most serious way. They truly unbro'd. It's sacrilege to the Patriarchy and its pantheon of gods, like the eldritch horror of tess-toss-tose and god of sweaty sports broseidon. The Patriarchy runs secret groups like bropus dei, to thwart humans from transitioning and keep society locked in a bondage of fixed identity.

Do keep in mind folks this is all just humor... maybe.
Explains the reactions I’ve been getting in job interviews. It’s subtle but at times you can catch it slipping through.
And it's even sadder because every trans woman I've met loves femininity more than most cis women I know! Why would we want to erase the coolest thing in the world!?
Still rather depressing in outlook
Fr fr tho misogyny after you start passing as mtf is pretty intense 💯💯
If we could only get towards the direction of respect. 

We have to deal with outright hate and intolerance, and with the media fueling the fire, some are under direct attack.
Damn, so sorry you've had that experience with other transmasc people. I know what you mean tho, as a trans man myself I have had quite a few more unfortunate encounters with transmascs than transfems. We got unlucky
This. This is the one. Bioessentialism and misogyny all in one real shitty package.
Yup 💯💯💯
But honestly 99% of violent and sex crimes are committed by cis men with penises
it’s actually Trans exclusionary radical feminist (the exclusionary is that they don’t accept trans women as women)
Trans exclusive radical feminist (even tho you could argue that they are not really feminists). Someone being transphobic to « protect women’s rights »
>poor little brainwashed victims.

THIS PART is what really gets me. That disgusting infantilization. The smug assumption that trans men are actually just silly widdle girls with unfortunate, tragic ideas in their widdle heads, the poor lost lambs. It makes me want to tear my hair out. Sometimes it feels like being mansplained to all over again, but now it includes cis women.
I love the eccentric wording on this that feels more than a typical comment feels.
It is and sadly only getting worse.
It is, and what we're seeing lately is the mere tip of an EXTREMELY depressing iceberg.
Ikr. It’s sad that so many trans men begin to act just like the cis men who treated us so horribly. The amount of transphobic FTMs is upsetting.
Indeed, it’s more about the generalization that the genitals make the person, not what the person chooses to do with their genitals.
Cis women actually commit a lot more sex crimes than what the statistics show though. Its just often not as severe because of the power imbalance in mens favor, and sex crimes/harrassment committed by women is not seen a crimes in many cases. I am mtf and I have experienced assault/harrassment by cis women both as a child and as an adult. Being closeted growing up, my male friends as a teenager all had stories of adult cis women having been inappropriate with them. It is fairly common for 12-13-14 year old boys to have their sexual debut with a much older cis woman as well. It just never gets reported because it is not seen as a crime, and it is extremely difficult for the victims to be taken seriously, so the statistics doesn't reflect it.
I am not religious in the least. But preach
yes, but what terfs are claiming is that 99% of people with penises are committing the violent and sex crimes
They don’t accept trans men as men, either. They welcome them into their special “women’s spaces” because to them, that’s what they are.
i consider the F in TERF to stand for fascist
That's where the term FART comes in ""Feminism Apropriating Radical Transphobe.""
Exactly.  And it’s the opposite of the lived experience of many trans men.  Like for me my first inklings that I was a boy came when I was toddler and then hit a high when I was going through puberty and adolescence but societal influences made me think this was just not possible.  I grew up with no representation to look toward and in school I was categorized with girls on a daily basis, so I convinced myself that my feelings must be wrong and I pushed them deep down.  I was in denial for decades.  

I’m 36 yo and going to my first HRT appointment on Monday (yay!) after over a year of soul searching.  I’m glad I’m here, but I’ve spent this past year working hard on undoing the societal brainwashing that I went through when I was growing up.
True!! I am mtf so I dont know how it feels to be infantilized to that degree, but I feel with trans-men that have to hear this every single day.
Yay! I have eccentric wording, but in a positive way. Best thing reddit told me all day. I'll take it!


*Does the snoopy happy dance down the sidewalk*
Yeah, now it’s moving to the “degenerate freaks” and a “cancer to society that must be eradicated” type fascist shit.

Ugh I fucking hate this world. At least more cis people are catching on that it’s so much worse than they thought
Close to home this hits
I was sexualy harassed by a cis woman at a public swimming pool when I was 15 years old. I still don't like going to public swimming pools 30 years later.
Fair
Agreed. Remember that protest in Melbourne where Nazis helped the TERFs? 

If 9 Nazis are sitting at a table…
Congratz on getting your first HRT appointment, I hope it makes you feel better and you get great results 😁
I am 37, and just started estrogen 3 months ago (when I was still 36)!  I know the decades of denial all too well! Congrats on taking the step out of denial! I hope you’re as excited for your journey as I am mine!
Thank you!  I feel for trans women, too.  My blood boils every time I hear some idiot claim that trans women are just trying to invade cis women’s spaces and act like you all are predators when you’re just trying to live your best lives.  Much love to you and my other trans sisters 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
The only freaks are the ones who want to reach in my pants while I’m using the restroom. I have to give you cancer because that’s exactly what the assholes are. It’s just projection from them onto us. I hated it years ago and the battle wasn’t at the forefront like it is now.
Thank you 😊
Thank you!  I’m excited for you too!  It’s nice to see a light at the end of the tunnel 😊"	12ncsj3	trans	890	0.98	2023-04-15 17:57:08
Help with young child questioning gender	"My son is still very young (almost 5), and every since he could talk, he's basically given every sign that he identifies as being female (I'm still using he/him pronouns because he has not requested to be referred to as she/her... I don't even know if 5 year olds understand pronouns though lol). Anyways, for as long as I can remember, he has always preferred female characters from shows and toys. Whenever he plays imaginary games he is ALWAYS the mom or the princess. He's also pointed at a female character in a book and told me that's him... the girl.

As he's gotten older, he's started requesting dresses and anything that is ordinarily deemed ""girly"". At first, he was just stealing his sister's clothes, but when I realized how much he liked her clothes, we went out and bought him his own wardrobe filled with dresses and all things pink. He's also started to grow his hair out because he wants to look more like a girl.

I really don't know if 5 is too young to know your gender, but I'm really just doing my best to follow his lead and help him be comfortable no matter which gender he aligns with, but I honestly have no idea what I'm doing which is why I'm posting.

What are good ways I can support him and what are things I should be sure not to do?

Should I let him wear dresses to school at this age or should I worry that he's not old enough yet to be able to deal with bullies? I hate that I have to worry about that, but there is no doubt that he will encounter mean people in school. Right now, he's happy with wearing his clothes at home, to stores, and around family and friends who are supportive.

Is it common for trans children this age to so strongly identify with the other gender or is that something that typically develops around puberty?

If you are trans, did your parents do things at a young age that you thought was helpful and supportive? If not, what do you wish they would have done for you? 

I'm not trans, but I did not having emotionally supportive parents. I want my own children to have a different experience and feel supported no matter what which is why I'm here asking for help.

Thank you!

Update: Thank you so much for the support, suggestions, and for sharing your own stories! I probably won't be able to respond to every comment, but I've read them all and really appreciate them. I've already ordered several of the book suggestions and am excited to share them with him.

I obviously don't know whether he will be a trans adult or not, but I think that right now, teaching him that he has our full support to explore his own identity is the most important thing. Our other kids are also learning about gender expression differences as well which I hope will help them to become better adults."	"I don’t have any experience with a situation like this, but I think the most important thing you can do (aside from doing what you’re already doing) is make sure he knows trans people exist. Maybe buy or get some picture books from the library about trans kids or look up if there are age appropriate videos or tv shows with trans kids (or adults)
I’m on this forum for my trans daughter who is 6. I only realized this year what she had been telling us since she was 3. Your story sounds very similar to ours. I don’t have any answers for you, but I’m glad we finally heard our girls voices.

I recently learned about how hard it is for kids to transition later in life, and families have told me how lucky we are to know so early. The best advice I’ve received thus far is to just “love the child you have today”. I’ve found this lowers my anxiety about the 1000 questions I have that don’t actually need answers to yet. 

Good luck to you both on your journey!

5 is absolutely not too young, the average age at which children begin communicating their gender is age 3
Honestly besides letting them know what being Trans is and that Transgender people exist, it sounds like you're absolutely slaying the parent thing. I wish I had parents like you at that age. 😕

You're already being extremely supportive. I think once they grasp the idea of what it means to be Trans, the answers may come quicker. Either way, props on doing what you've already done and asking questions.  Sending love
r/cisparenttranskid could be a great resource for you! It’s full of folks having these same discussions.

Some people know as young as 3 or 4, others don’t have issues with their gender until puberty or beyond. You look to be on the right track with helping your kid out, and finding community with other parents can be invaluable. Thanks for reaching out!
You might find Jeffrey Marsh’s work (@thejeffreymarsh on Instagram) helpful. They’re non-binary, knew it at a young age, and post about self-acceptance, parenting, and all things gender. Thank you for being a good parent to your kid!
My friend has a genderfluid (?) child who’s been questioning their gender since like 5? They’re 10 now. They don’t fully understand their gender yet and that’s ok because both of their parents support them. Like they told their mom “on Mondays Wednesdays and Fridays I’m gonna be a girl and on Tuesdays and Thursdays a boy”. When questioned on the weekends they were just like “🤷🏼 I’m with mommy and daddy”. 

Anyways they wear dresses to school and overall they haven’t had many issues. They’re also allowed nail polish but more make up than that is for the weekend (which I think is normal for most elementary school kids?) There’s one boy who can be a bit of a bully, but everyone else seems to be ok and they worked it out so they won’t be in the same class next year.  We’re in New England in the US, so your mileage in schools can vary.

>What are good ways I can support him and what are things I should be sure not to do?

Don't read too much into it right now, a child's development is a long and messy process. They will be going through a lot of self exploration, just try your best to follow their needs where they lead. You're already doing really well in this department!

If this trend continues, find a good psychiatrist that specializes with LGBT issues in children and seek their input. Sexual differentiation happens at puberty, so you have lots of time ahead of you and you're in the right mindset to raise them right. No serious changes need to happen until then, and your child will be much better equipped to decide whether they want to transition.
It depends on the person when they realize they identify with the other gender, but your kid is definitely not too young. I know I questioned my identity as a young kid (unsupportive conservative grandparents didn’t allow me to be who I wanted to be). I’ve always leaned on the masculine side. I’m not gonna say it’s “common” but it’s certainly not impossible/super rare! Allowing him to make choices is definitely important! When/if he decides to change his pronouns and/or name the best thing would be for you to be fully supportive and allow him to make those decisions. Some things that would’ve been helpful for me personally: 1. Knowing that trans people exist. I didn’t know that till like a year before I came out. 2. HRT (hormones) are important to us (as trans people). We experience gender dysphoria and some parents are kinda jerks about hrt. Yes, I believe you should know the issues that could happen with hrt, but I think you should try to be open to the idea if he brings it up. Of course, not all trans people want hormones so that’s something to think about too. I think you’re doing the right thing :)
Reminds me of me when I was younger. Unfortunately, crippling social anxiety manifested itself at a very young age and I was very scared to ask to try girl things. I'd say the best you can do is try to follow along with the kid, and continue to support them until they know who they are
I can’t guarantee how your child will end up identifying, but what i can say is, let them figure out themselves and allow them to experiment and self-express according to what they feel. Without barring him from that opportunity or ‘putting him into a box’ that may not fit.


I know I sure wish my parents did this when I was younger, instead of pushing me into a box I didn’t even realise was wrong for me. Would have saved a lot of years of confusion and fear to be myself.
When I was 5, I would steal my sister's clothes. At that age I didn't know what being transgender was but I remember wishing I was born female. As I got older and understood what being trans was, I was very conflicted as I was raised by anti-LGBTQ parents. I would go back and forth between accepting it and even shaving my legs at 16, and denying it. I finally accepted it about a year ago and I'm 19 now. Point is, I think you're doing a good job easing your kid into their own identity! If they're showing signs that early, its likely they won't change their mind as it obviously caught up with me. I wish my parents would have taken the approach you are.
It could be a phase, it could be for life. The only way to know for sure is to give it time. So long as you support your kid and don’t try to enforce any gender norms, it’s all good.
I was a kid like this! I’m a trans man, but at his age I used to wear khaki shorts and polo shirts all the time because it’s what my dad wears to work and I wanted to look like him. I didn’t really have a concept of gender too much back then I think, it only hit me when we hit 4th/5th grade and suddenly boys and girls couldn’t be friends and play together because it was “weird” or something- that was when I started to feel out of place. Even then, I didn’t know that you *could* be trans until I was around 12/13 and Caitlyn Jenner was in the news. As another anecdote, a friend of mine is a trans woman and as early as 4 would tell her parents to call her different Disney Princess names depending on how she’s feeling and she did the same thing with her hair and clothes (her name is Belle- which is an adorable origin story).

With that in mind- I think it’s best to let your kid explore and do whatever they want, but I think it might be good to have a conversation with the school administration and maybe also your kid about how people might react to them. not telling them to assume people will be bullies, but how to respond and what to do if it happens, and how their words shouldn’t impact what they want to do and look like. r/cisparenttranskid might be good as a resource too, although there’s a lot less traffic

So, I didn't realize it when i was young but looking back I was showing very similar signs as your child (my earliest memory is me being obsessed with skirts (i still am but thats beside the point)) no age is too young for someone to question their gender identity and it might help prevent trauma, dysphoria and internalized transphobia to some degree if they figure it out early. (most likely wont fully go away, i am very aware) Also it will help with puberty if its figured out before hand and, although i know this is far in the future, puberty blockers are really usefull from what I've heard. Hope this helped in anyway, I'm writing this super sleep deprived at 3:30 am so I'm sorry if its not
You’re doing a great job! I’m trans, FTM, and I showed signs of it very young. My parents hated it and wouldn’t let me explore those ideas. So I suppressed it and it came out just last year. I wish they had allowed me to be myself so I wouldn’t be so confused and hurt all the time. I’m glad to see more parents like you, good job :)
5 year olds are old enough to know what does and doesn't make them feel happy. To him, dysphoria is just sad. Im of the opinion to let children express themselves how they want without much boundary. If I were you I'd let him do what makes him happy.
I knew at 4 that I was not like the other boys. I don’t know if this is common, but it is not uncommon to know that young. I think it’s particularly telling because children of that age don’t understand transgender; they just know who they are and what they like. Allowing your child to wear dresses can come with issues, like bullying. Perhaps you can talk to the school and see how supportive they are willing to be. Best of luck!
I’m not an expert at this but children that young have been able to tell they’re trans but it’s less common until they get older. You’re doing the right thing though by letting them experiment as even if they aren’t, it should instil some good qualities around gender as they get older. Hope it all goes well and wish all the best for you and your wee one! :)

Also, if you’re worried, go see a doctor. They’ll probably forward you onto some mental health specialist who can help you because it’s always hard having a potentially trans child as you aren’t really told about it beforehand. Best wishes!
if your child wants to do something, let them! gender exploration is common in children, and does not always mean that they are trans. however, if they are, it is important to let them decide. just give your son some time, and im sure answers will arise
When I was little, about this age, I knew I was a boy. I didn't want to wear the girls clothes or shoes and would only play with 'boy ' toys. 
I wanted my hair short so I refused to brush my hair or have it brushed.
Any time I needed to be dressed up and  have my hair brushed It was a full break down, I was crying, my parents were exhausted and both of our patience was running out, so we compromised.  

 Something that helped me was my dad got me my haircut, short but still girl. 
My mom got me shirts and light up shoes with dinosaurs on them. And all my dresses were replaced by overalls and pants. 
 Nothing was overly boy or girl but it was enough for me. 

I didn't know how to explain myself but I knew I was a boy and just wasn't sure how. I didn't understand why I was treated like a girl or given a name that made me so sad and angry. 

Your child may be cis or trans and grow up to decide he's a boy. Or she will be a girl. Or a they / them. 

Either way I'm sure you letting your child be a child and listening and trying to understand as they express feelings they may not understand is going to make everything so much easier. 

Wish you and your family a happy, healthy life!
I would say let him be who he is as much as possible, and take him seriously. One of my earliest memories was around 4 years old, telling my mother that I was a girl, and I was dead serious. This was the early 80s, so there was no such thing in mainstream culture or in most people's minds about trans people, so my parents really didn't know what to do or if I was just saying stuff without really knowing what I was saying.

Even as it became crystal clear, almost exactly as you've described about your own child, they were also very concerned about bullys, and my entire life growing up, there was very little that I could do that was ""for girls"" that wouldn't get me beaten up or ridiculed. Long hair? Nope. Pierced ears? Nope? ""Girl"" toys? Nope. Dresses and skirts...absolutely not. 

But my parents I think, did a decent job of balancing what I wanted to do with what was acceptable at the time. And even then, I was always getting bullied for things I liked or did or said. There was no way around it.

Times have changed a lot, though I can't speak for exactly how much or to your particular city / state / region. I do have a niece who is 12, whose best friend is a trans girl. 

It still will be rough, it's not going to be easy. Love your child and support them all the way through, whatever they decide or need to do. ❤️
My friend has a kid who seems to be leaning towards girl since they were that age. Every morning they ask if they are feeling more like a boy or girl for the day and just follow their lead. From what I can tell most of the time they go with girl and seem much happier these days Do what you need to make sure your child is happy and healthy and you wont go wrong
Your kid might not actually know that different pronouns are even an option. Have you ever asked them about pronouns? (Hey do you want me to say he or she when I’m talking about you? Maybe the next time you can ask if they want to wear dresses to school and have people call them a girl then. Is switching schools an option for you?) You control a lot about whether this is an option for your kid. Your kid can be a girl if (she) wants to and if you support her as a parent and in your /(her) communities. Don’t live in fear of the bullies. Be political about it if you live in texas (or if you live elsewhere in the US), build a better world about it.

It’s really easy for everyone in an elementary school to accept that this kid who looks like a girl, acts like a girl, whose parents say she’s a girl… is a girl. You know? There might not actually be more bullying if she socially transitions, there might even be less; maybe this helps her make social bonds as she goes through school. 

No, I don’t think your kid is too young to be trans. Sounds like it’s pretty instinctual for them. A lot of people do know when they’re young. Sometimes people don’t have the autonomy/opportunity/safety to express those things. If you and your family, etc support her everything will probably feel very normal. And your kid is young enough that they could have more control over their own puberty if they they want to later on. Just because a lot of people realize they want to transition after having been through a puberty that ended up giving them dysphoria doesn’t mean that’s the only way people have to be trans.
I think you’re doing great. You’re not pushing anything, the kid has the lead and I think that’s important, you’re being the most supportive you can.

About the other questions, well, we all experience gender in different ways, so yeah, even though puberty is when for most people it hits, kids can realize it early (Kim Petras is a trans musician that transitioned I think at 7)

And no, my parents were definitely not supportive when I was a kid. I wish they would just listen to me and not completely ignore what I was saying, even though I couldn’t articulate like an adult
First off, you're doing great already! You're allowing and encouraging your kid to affirm their gender, and you've come here to ask questions! 

I'd ask your kid if they want you to call them a girl, use she/her, or pick a new name. Explain what gender is, and that they can change it if they want. You don't need to go deep into it (and probably shouldn't) but it's good to teach them the basics. Also make sure to say that they don't need to make a decision right away, they can think about it and come back later, and it's their choice no matter what. If your kid wants to be a girl, congratulations! You have a daughter! If your kid wants to be a boy, then you just have a son who likes girly things, which is great too! 

If you want to minimize bullying, one option could be to wait until the next school year. Coordinate with the school to make sure your daughter is introduced as a girl and the teachers know what to do. The other kids will probably just think she's another girl they haven't met before, and they won't even know! 

If your kid turns out to be a girl, I'd suggest preparing your insurance, medical care, etc for anything she may need down the line. She may want/need to start puberty blockers or hormones in less than 10 years, so make sure your insurance both promises to cover for that and is known to follow through with that promise.

Also keep in mind that I'm not a parent or an expert, just a trans girl on the internet describing what I wish my parents had done. Hope this helps!
Speaking from experience I identified as female probably since I was 3 years old, or at least as early as I could remember; but I grew up in a really conservative household and even indicating something like that was extremely discouraged, but yeah I knew what gender I was long before puberty, and puberty sucked.
Be my mom please
This is such a sweet post- I wish more parents were like this.

While I don’t have any advice, I think what you’re doing is awesome! Keep up the good work :)
I always messed around with femme things at a really young age and liked them, but was turned away and yelled at a lot of the time due to it. Just support them and do what you are. Sounds like you are doing your best and that’s what matters! Wish my parents were like you <3
Just support him or her. And if he says he's trans try to see a doctor in a gender clinic.
The best advice I could try to give is to be supportive, listen to your kid's feelings and make sure you take his opinion into consideration- evenif he's young. These seem like pretty obvious things but a lot of parents can worry or stress about certain decisions that'll affect their kid and accidentally overlook what their kids might want

While I certainly didn't know this early, I started questioning around puberty. My parents weren't supportive, and my mum is still a firm believer that I'll thank her for what shes done when I'm her age (""if I support this and your not trans you'll hate me for it, but if I don't support this and you really are trans you'll hate me for that, too"" type of thought process)
My mum loved me- still loves me- but she tends to overlook me or my brother's opinions on our own lives because we're seen as children in her eyes.

You're already doing miles by asking for advice and listening to your kid's needs. I salute you, and hope that you're able to figure things out along the way
[deleted]
I just wanna say as a young(ish) adult who wasn’t supported right away and didn’t come out until middle school im crying happy tears right now to hear parents are actually paying attention to these kinds of things i can’t even imagine what my life would have been like if my parents had supported me like that and that young even tho i was still lucky to start transitioning in middle school. so from all the trans kids who would’ve done anything to have parents like you thank you for giving your child that support
I don't have kids so can't really give good advice but in case no one else has recommended it so far I just found an amazing podcast last week called 'how to be a girl'
It is a mother of a trans girl documenting parts of their experience. It started in 2016 when the girl was 6 and she apparently told her mother as young as 3 that she was a girl.
The women also apparently has a blog though I haven't seen that yet as I still have more episodes to get through.
I think it might be really good for you to listen to as it is a women who has done this and seems very open to giving advice.
The fact that you have come here asking shows you are willing to go the distance for your kid so yeah just please keep being the awesome parent you are!!!
speaking from similar experience - I knew I was not a boy at an early age as well, but this was back during the Reagan administration and Thatcher governments, so that was quickly kiboshed. It absolutely wrecked my sense of self for the better part of three decades.

Let your child explore who they are. Nothing will destroy a child's self-esteem and self worth faster than forcing them into an artificial mould.

Let them know they will be heard! If they come to you and say ""I'm a girl"", you better believe it and act like it.

Let your school know what's going on. depending on where you are living, they may be chill or not, but at least it won't be a surprise. At the absolute minimum, let your child be themselves at home. Tell them you love them and give them all the affirmation you can and then some.

it **may** come to pass that this leads nowhere - yes, it happens - and they **might** grow out of it, but if and until that happens, support them no matter what.
I don’t have expirience in this, so just know i’m no professional.

I would just say to roll with it. Support them in whatever way they request support. If they want dresses and dolls, give them dresses and dolls. Let them explore it on their own and just let them know you support them no matter how they feel genderwise. If it comes to the point in a decade or so when puberty would start and they still feel this way, maybe consult a doctor in good time to see if hormones are an option. They’re still young enough that no big decisions need to be made, so just foster whatever they like and who ever they say they are
If I had been given the knowledge and been treated with openness and kindness and love as you have been doing already, I would have been expressing such things as early as your kid. You’re doing amazing and I deeply appreciate the love and care you have for your kid. 💜
>I really don't know if 5 is too young to know your gender

It's not. I was wishing I were a girl as young as 3-4 years old. It never stopped.

>Should I let him wear dresses to school at this age or should I worry that he's not old enough yet to be able to deal with bullies?

Yes absolutely. In fact if you let him present as a girl bullies might not even know your child is trans. You having your kid's back (and your kid confident in your support) will mean so much more than the hurt a bully could possibly inflict. Trust me on this. I would have killed to have a parent as supportive as you are.

>Is it common for trans children this age to so strongly identify with the other gender

It's not unheard of

>If you are trans, did your parents do things at a young age that you thought was helpful and supportive? 

No. I learned very early on that I should hide my inclinations toward anything feminine. I didn't want to be seen as ""gay"" and thus ""lesser""

>If not, what do you wish they would have done for you?

They could have started by not being homophobic. My family laughed so hard at the ""man in a dress"" joke that was on media so often. Stuff like that made me so afraid to be myself.

>I'm not trans, but I did not having emotionally supportive parents. I want my own children to have a different experience and feel supported no matter what which is why I'm here asking for help.

From a trans mom to another mom - who was also raised by emotionally unsupportive/unavailable parents - you're doing awesome. Parents like you give me hope for our future.
A woman I work with, her granddaughter is 7 and one of her friends in class is a trans girl and everyone is accepting of it. The kids just get on with school and there’s no bullying. I have found tho that Scotland is very much a progressive part of the uk for the most part. Like where I live I’ve only had a couple of issues with hate. I think being supportive as you are now is really important and letting your child discover who they are while making sure they’re ok and happy is hugely important. I never had that support and hid who I was until I was 42 which caused a lot of hurt over the years
Luckily if your kid is that young they have years and years to figure out their identity before they have to make any tough decisions.  Probably a good idea to talk to the school about whether or not it is a good idea to wear dresses.  I think you're probably right to be concerned about bullying but you also have to take into account whether or not they are uncomfortable with wearing boy clothes to school.
Depends honestly. They seem pretty clear about their identity but if its a hostile enviroment id try and get some consultation from a therapist.
My little boy wears dresses! He’s only 3 and doesn’t really care about gender, but he has a good mix of masculine and feminine things, shirts with Spider-Man are his favorite though. My plan is to continue to let him lead in what he wants to wear including his feminine things. All we can do as parents is grow with them and let them know their feelings and choices are valid. I’m so glad you’re so supportive of your kiddo as a trans person.
My daughter came out at just over 3 years. She's gender fluid and has an incredible grasp of gender and related topics. She had been wearing dresses and growing her hair out for about a year before that. She had just turned three when she used the words ""I'm a girl"". Now, being gender fluid, she does also have boy days and non-binary days. But she has a very sophisticated sense of her gender and what it means to her. 

One thing we wanted to do very early was mitigate unnecessary gender dysmorphia. So we really spent some effort normalizing the concept of a girl penis. We wanted her to know that lots of girls have them and they are totally normal. She was very disappointed to learn about the fact that as it currently stands that she could not carry a baby. So we spent some time showing her ways in which trans women can be mothers. She is very happy with that idea and is confident that she is destined for motherhood. 

Regarding bullying -- depends where you live. It's not a problem here, but I'm told that we are the exception (upper-middle class west coast Canada). I'm sure there could be some here... She's not in school yet. But my elder daughter had a trans teacher, so I'm pretty sure we're all relatively woke (fingers crossed at least). I'd make sure to have lots of talks (maybe therapy) to make sure that they are confident before bringing it to school. Make sure to show them all of the options. They could be non-binary and not see the ""girl"" lable as a perfect fit. Maybe they have a superficial concern holding them back? Or maybe they are a boy who is just a little fabulous? 

It's clear that you are already on the right path. Just remember that it's awesome to be trans. So if that's what your child is, don't just ""deal"" with it. Celebrate it.
Wdym strongly identify?? We trans people are trans from the day we are born
hey, so first of all, you're amazing, i know so many people who would just force their kid to wear male clothing, accepting parents are amazing.

oh btw imma use they/them pronouns for your kid in this post. but i think you should have a talk with your kid about if they want to be called a girl and about pronouns and stuff, at that age the best way to ask kids about pronouns is ask if they want to be called a her/him/them and then use the pronouns that your kid wants, and ask the school to use them to, it will help your kid a lot if their freinds and teachers call them a girl.

 i would do the same thing with names, ask your kid if they want to be called a difrent name, and if they do help them pick one if they havnt already, and then use it. it is possible that your kid might not want to change their name now, but might ask to later, and thats ok too! you really nead to follow your kid's lead on this one

if your kid wants to wear dresses and stuff to school, let them, i would talk to the school about it first, make sure the teachers are cool about it, and wouldnt treat them any difrent bc of it, but i honestly wouldnt worry about other kids, at that age they're pretty accepting, they probs will encounter bullies later on, but i think they're preaty safe at this age, you might want to encorage an open diyologe with your kid about school and stuff, make them know that its all right for them to talk to you about anything, and also have an open diologe with the school, make sure they tell you if there are any problems

and as for the relising your trans thing, most kids eather relise they're trans around the ages of 3-7 (even if they dont know what trans means then) or round the start of puberty, so i would trust your kid about it.

i think the thing i most wish my parents had done for me as a kid is buy me the clothes i was comfortable  in, they didnt, my parents are very transphobic, but i wish every day that they would. (its very hard to pretend your a guy when your parents forse you into pink, frilly dresses)

this is longer than i espected it to be, oh well. good luck, i think its great that you're suporting your kid like this

(i apologise for the spelling i'm dyslexic and auto corect usuly corects words to something horobul so i just dont use it and hope ppl understand me)
Never ever too young! My mum isn’t supportive now an I’m nearly 40. 
Trans kids have high rates of suicide the main cause is unsupported parents. 
The best thing you can do is keep a open mind and create a safe space for your child to explore their gender identity without judgment. It won’t be easy and it maybe a phase but you’re child will definitely be grateful for you as that get older if you have their back. 
Most children between the age of 3 and 5 know that their sex is different from their gender. 
Do some research, there’s tons of books out there. Join some online and irl groups. Keep asking questions here and just keep loving your kid unconditionally! As a community we need parents like that 🥰
Def knew when I was little, had it bullied out of me... was not good for my mental health. I would say just let them be gets my vote, accept them as they grow into their own experience of gender etc.. idk... The podcast ""How to be a girl"" documents the experience from someone in your situation, might be helpful because she asks obvious and hard questions so it's not just fluff.
By that age I once used the feminine form of ""thank you"" (in my language there's a small difference whether you're male or female) and I was ridiculed by it by an aunt. I'm sure it was ""all in good fun"" and they didn't think much about it. But I did and to this day I'm sour about. I'm now 26 and my family has no idea I'm trans, I've gone NC for about a year now.

I'm sorry, I have no advice and just wanted to vent. You're already being great and I wish I've had *you* growing up
I'm so glad you reached out here. I was the same. But my parents didn't care. I didn't even know trans people existed when I was little. Now I have to go through multiple surgries and such to become fem. I wish I came out a young age. I wish U would have had the guts to. I wish my family was accepting. I'm proud that you reached out and it warms my heart. You are an amazing parent. 

For advice, tell them about trans people, let them know if they want to be a girl, they can be a girl. If they say that they want to be a girl, then now you have a daughter. It's pretty simple. Kids know a lot more about themselves than you think.


If you are worried about it being to soon, one of my really good friends is transmasc and came out at 3. 

There are some negatives though. Being trans in today's world is really fucking hard, you will get hate. I get death threats ~3-5 times a day, and a lot of people will refuse to speak to me, including my coworkers and even a couple of the managers at my job. It will be your job as a parent to try and shield the hate as much as possible if they do decide that they are a girl. You will have to be an expert on literally all things trans to defend their existence. 

However, the positives will massively outweigh the negitives. Gender euphoria is amazing, and I actually feel happy for once after realizing I am a girl. Living trapped in the wrong body is a nightmare, and I wouldn't wish it on my worst enemy. I hope your child can feel the same. 

In all, let them chose, and thank you for reaching out and being an ally.
what you're doing now is amazing. your kid is so lucky to have a parent like you!! some of the suggestions i've seen here are also really great and can help a lot. my mom is currently part of a facebook group that i believe is called the Mama Bears, it's a support group for parents of trans children where everyone can share their experiences, support each other, and find ways to better support their children.

there are a lot of groups out there just like this one. i would recommend looking around and seeing what your community has to offer. good luck :)
I agree with the comment that stated you should let your little child know that trans people exist. When I was a little kid I always pretended to be a boy when I played, and have always identified more with male characters. I didn’t know that trans people existed until I was 13, at which point I asked my parents if I might be trans and they flat out stated “No, you’re not.” It was only this year that I fully realized that I AM because that’s how I FEEL. Educating your child so they can describe how they feel and feel safe talking to you is HUGE. You’re absolutely killing it as a parent, this gives me so much hope.
do they* want to wear dresses to school? ask directly if they’d be more comfortable doing that
talk to your child’s teachers if you do decide to let them wear dresses to school, make sure your child knows you support them and they can come to you if anyone does bully them

talk to them about what being trans is in child friendly ways (picture books, simplified explanations, just outright ask if they feel like theyre a boy or girl (or something else))

the best option is to let your kid be comfortable and be themselves, i know from personal experience suppressing that was more harmful than any bullying or transphobia ive faced
First off, thank you! All children need the sort of love you’re showing, especially trans kids! 

I definitely think talking to the teacher, and gauging where the school is at, would be a good idea. I would also talk through it with your child, they may not even want to wear dresses to school. I know I would have been scared of that as a kid, but I come from a very conservative community. If you are doing your best to support and know teachers will do the same. That will do a lot to help withstand bullying. We all go through very difficult things in life and it goes miles to know someone has your back. The  mistreatment I get from strangers is far less hurtful than what I get from family. You can’t avoid the world being tough, especially if you’re trans. But as a parent you can do your best to give the tools to cope with that difficulty. 

You’re doing an excellent job! It’s really great how you’ve let him decide what to wear. Sometimes it’s hard to let your kids take the lead. It’s really important they know you’ll love no matter what!
i wanted to be a girl since i can remember, but i was uneducated on my rights as a person and i thought i was 'a glitch in the matrix' for wanting to be a girl. i'm 20 next month and highly regret not following myself at a younger age, you can absolutely be trans at any age. please, just hold his hand for the ride. and there's NOTHING wrong with asking him if he wants to be a girl. my advice is just to make him aware that he's allowed to be who he wants to be, and maybe educate him on select things down the road. like don't have a talk about genitals right yet but you can at least tell him he has a choice as to what his pronouns are, and ask him if he's comfortable being addressed as a girl or boy. also, idk like can you be my mom🥺, i'm kidding but genuinely we need more mothers like you. anyways back to talks, when it comes time to educate him on genital related things, just know even if he's comfortable with his current genitalia but decides to be a woman that he's still valid. 

 note: i used (he/him) because from the sounds of it with my limited context, he's at least handling being referred to with those pronouns well. if he turns out to still go by those pronouns after being asked, then me using (they/them) would be seen as rude towards him, so i'm trying to be respectful from my limited context.
I knew around that age, it's definitely not too young, I would just let them be how they want and fully support them in pursuing that, including letting them wear the clothing they feel most comfortable in

As for bullies... like... if I'm being completely honest, speaking from experience, the whole bullying thing is really overblown, unless you're, like, in some really backwards and conservative area, I'm guessing it won't really be a problem, although you should of course still watch out for any signs that there might be problems with other children

I would also try to educate them on what being trans is and the fact that they can be a girl; you said they haven't requested to be referred to using she/her pronouns, but are they aware that that's an option? It's probably good to make sure they know it is and that you'll completely support their pronoun choice regardless

**Also, I know that this is a while away given that they're only five, but I cannot possibly emphasize how important it is that you get them proper hormones literally the second puberty starts for them if they turn out to really be trans**

(Btw I wanna say that you're an amazing mother for accommodating your child and taking the effort to ask for advice like this, I'd probably be in a much better place right now if I'd had parents like you)
You are doing everything right, as far as I can tell.

The main thing is how much you love this little kid, and are allowing them to actuate their internal identity.

Your little one is NOT a boy. They've  been socializing as a girl since they were very young. They don't know what being a boy is all about. They don feel like a boy, and is very happy being who they actually are--a little female.

I don't know where you live, or what your community is like. But really, if you start socializing them in school as a girl, their classmates won't know the difference--or much care.

Unfortunately, being the temporary owner of a penis might cause some issues---but if their friends are all used to them presenting as a female, it really shouldn't be much of a problem.

Love is always the answer to raising trans kids; if they feel supported and affirmed and NEVER marginalized, then there really isn't much wrong you can do.

You seem to be doing a great job!!!

This kid is REALLY fortunate to have you guys are parents...
So I have some resources that might be able to help like books and other posts!!!

Please feel free to stop by r/transgenderhelp and ask us questions and we will guide you!!
All the other comments are great, also you've been doing your part perfectly. I will add that it is possible that your kid ""wants to be a boy"" again in their teens. Children's brain are very complicated, just let them know they can still go back if they need to. In the meantime, continue to support them the way you are and they're gonna grow happy and healthy!
Hey OP theres a book called Melissa by Alex gino and i think showing your child it will make them feel understood! Its about how the world sees Melissa as a boy called george and how she managed to get a female role in a play at her school and starts to be herself. I personally havent read the book fully but i did a small study on it in my college  and im pretty sure your childs too young to read it but im sure if you read it to them theyd love it!. Thankyou for being an awesome accepting parent OP the world needs more of you.
It sounds like you are already on a great path and honoring what your child wants as he takes the journey. As I look back, my trans son wanted a boy bedroom at 4-5.  I gave him one. His interactions with Barbies were to ride on say dinosaurs. He stopped hair bows early. I had no clue about it being a possibility.  Looking back he looked mad or miserable in the girly clothes I had him stuffed in and right at home in boyish tees and shirts that were house clothes. I very much so think they know. I’ve just allowed my son’s journey to go as he directed. He is handsome and confident in his true form. 

You sound amazing as a parent.

Edited:  when my son hit high school. The hair became shorter and clothes masculine and even without HRT yet, he is very happy to be called he and have his chosen name used.  I think they guide you.
You're letting your kid lead the way, that's all you can do. He'll tell you who he is, with time. Being open about things is the best thing you can do - and you're doing it.
From my personal experience, I started showing signs around age 3.  My mother told me what ""transsexuals"" were at age 8 and when I said that's how I feel she didn't take it well.  Ended up with me being horrifically bullied for years more because I could never fit in with the boys, things only got worse for me when puberty hit resulting in a deep depression and pushed me into suppressing myself until I was 27, I talked myself out of coming out again until I was nearly 31 because I was convinced it was too late to start transitioning.  I'm so much happier and healthier since coming out and starting my transition, I still wish I had supportive parents like you while I was growing up.

Seems like you're doing a good job so far, I feel like it's best to let your child explore their identity like you're currently doing, only they can know how they truly feel.  I let my son play with whatever toys he wanted and he did go through a time where he was enjoying ""girly"" things.  Shortly after I came out he said to me ""I thought about if I'd like to be a girl, I don't think I'd like it, I'm happy being a boy"".  I'm really glad he's able to think about these things and speak to me without being embarrassed or self-conscious.  Thanks for being a supportive parent.
Im trans and showed signs at around that age athough i didnt transition till later in my teens. and growing up in my home, my parents always made it clear to me and my siblings that you can be who ever you want. They never questioned and asked what i wanted as it was obvious. They allowed me to dress in different clothes explore different play and hobbies. My childhood as i remeber wasnt confusing as i just did my own thing. It wasn't till later on in my early teens where they started asking me more about my thoughts around gender. I think the best thing is to love and support them and answer the questions they ask you about gender. Also teaching them they dont have to be a certain gender to do certain things.
Seriously take him to a specialist, they will know what to do.
> I don't even know if 5 year olds understand pronouns though lol

A great first step would be explaining them and asking your child if they have preferences, if they would maybe like to try different pronouns in an environment they feel safe (e.g. within the home) but prefer you continue to use birth pronouns when in more public spaces. Does your child want to communicate their preferences themselves? When would they feel comfortable with you being a proxy communicator for their preferences?

Best of luck to you!
I love how supportive you are, just make sure that you make an appointment with a doctor, so you will know for sure what is going on, and if it turns out that he is a she, and it's legal there he/she can go on puberty blockers.

&#x200B;

I wish I had parents like you :/
I think you are already doing what you should. Sounds like you actively listen to the child and try to give them what they seem to want. But you also seem to have many questions and I think it is good for you to get answers early, because that will likely help later on, and if not, at the very least you’ll have awareness that will make you a great ally to the community.
I think it is important first to understand that there is a difference between gender role, gender expression and gender identity. While the first two are social constructs that will vary with culture and era, the third one is very real and very individual, and is what makes people feel at home in their bodies if they are cis, or dissonant if they are trans. There’s always a possibility that your kid might just like a female role and expression and be fine with their body, but I definitely wouldn’t count on that because those social constructs can often help us express this dissonance and/or cope with it, or even be a part of it. There is no age to be trans. Some of us understand very late in life how we feel while others feel it very young. Keep doing what you’re doing, being open to hearing your child’s needs and doing your best to meet them. I think for the potential bullying part, it should be your kid’s decision too if they want to risk it or not, and if it’s a concern, weather to fight it and be out and proud or transition in stealth. I second people suggesting to expose the kid to trans representation. Growing up, I knew about transfems, but I didn’t know about transmascs and that would probably have helped me come out much sooner and that would have saved me years spent living at the wrong frequency... Make sure they know about non binary folks as well. If your kid is indeed trans, their first step is going to be puberty blockers so that they don’t go through the wrong puberty. Those also can give a cis kid time to figure out if their natural puberty is the one they need. I’d make sure to know where and how to obtain those so that if it turns out to be needed, you and your kid won’t be stuck in wait times that could defeat the purpose of it...
For you right now, and maybe for your kid later, I want to recommend [Dr. Z’s channel](https://youtube.com/c/DRZPHD). She’s a specialized clinical psychologist and she answered a lot of my questions when I came out. 
In the meantime, I think you’re doing a great job! Thank you for being such a good parent to probably one of us ❤️
I didn't have supportive parents when I was young, but I would definitely wear girly clothes back then. I wasn't allowed to grow my hair until was like 12. So to answer your question it's perfectly normal for trans kids to do this things. My tip to you it's to make sure they know you love them regardless of their gender. You are great person, you made me smile 🥰
kids have an understanding of gender very very early, five definitely is not too young. As for advice, a lot of the other commentors have said enough so I'd only be repeating things xD
You sound like such a wonderful parent! This sounds so much like what I went through as a child, except I'm FtM. I would self identify as a boy, describe myself as one, I found generic feminine things offensive, etc. My parents didn't understand at all though. I'm not a parent, but what I would recommend is to continue providing them what they ask for (buying them dresses was so sweet!) Personally I would let them pick their outfits out for school (so long as it's functional and appropriate clothes for school, nothing that will get in the way of learning), and be ready to support your child if they're bullied. Bullying will happen, it happened to me all throughout my academic years, but YOUR support as the parent is what's most important to them. Encourage them to express themself, be themself, explore their identity at their own pace. Try to introduce some transgender characters or role models into their life, that's how I was able to communicate to my parents I was transgender and bisexual. There were queer characters in the shows me and my mother watched, and I pointed them out and told her that I was like them, and she was able to understand that. As far as hormone blockers go, that's a brand new concept to me, so I've got no advice on those, but if I were you, I would expect gender & sexual dysphoria to start when they start going through puberty. Do research into what you can do medically for your child to help them with that. When I started puberty and my hips widened and boobs started growing I did NOT like it one bit. I was growing further away from who I believed myself to be. I was told I was becoming a woman, but I just felt like people were no longer seeing me for me. I hope this helps.
I think you're doing very well. There are researches that show that we already start to develop the perception of our gender from 3/5 years old. You can buy children's books about being transgender, it might help. 

In my childhood, my parents weren't as supportive as you are. I asked for boys's clothes and they never gave it to me. And I admit I wish I had what you're giving your child. You are a great parent :)
Don't have any real pointers for you but just want to say that if my parents had been as open and accepting as you are, I wouldn't have waited 31 uears to come out! Keep doing what you're doing! Props for beimg a great parent! 💗💗
I recommend the book ""Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story"". I'm sure parts of it are inappropriate for your child's age so read it to them with a parental filter on... But I think it could be great for them as it was for me.
My mom used the Fggt word on me a lot. You sound like you are doing a perfect job. Love your kids so they will love you back.
Gay NB here. Your son reminds me of myself in my childhood. I pretty much did everything your son did when I was his age. And I didn’t explore my sexuality and gender identity until I was in college - mainly out of fear because I grew up with extremely conservative parents who forced me to be “male”. 

And by then, I was suffering from severe depression, social anxiety, and a painkiller addiction.

The point I’m trying to make is - you being there to support during his formative years will determine how healthy he will be MENTALLY as an adult. Do not force your child into a box because of YOUR feelings or fears. It’ll do more harm than good.
Well first of all, wow you are an awesome parent and we appreciate you for doing this. Yes you can know when you are that’s young. Some people do, some people don’t. My best friend when he was that young was very feminine and wore dresses and expressed all those signs. His parents took him to a gender therapist to see, and he realized he wasn’t trans. Take your child to a gender therapist (obviously a supportive one, like that’s just trying to support your child and see if they are trans)
Leave young children alone. You do not need to tell every single 6 year old they can be a girl.
It is very well possible that he just likes to appear feminine without actually being trans. It’s common and it’s okay. When I was about your sons age, I was super into tomboyish things and well, here I am now as a trans man. I didn’t know anything about being trans at five. It’s a complicated situation so I recommend you slow your son to present how he wants. If he learns about being trans in the future and makes that connection for himself, then that will seal the deal. Do not make this decision for him unless he is 110% sure.
Please tell him what puberty is and how it might conflict with his interests if left untreated before it starts. Watching your body become something you hate is a nightmare that I wouldn't wish on anyone.
See if the behavior continues into early teens
I can only think of 2 things about this post:

1. The boy is almost 5 and cannot make serious life altering decisions. So you ignore it, let the kid be a kid and he’ll eventually grow out of it. 

2. The person who posted this is either looking for Reddit clout, or is more likely a psychopath who doesn’t care about the long term psychological abuse the child (who is ALMOST 5!) is going to endure.

You seem like an amazing parent. I wish I had parents who were supportive at that age and seeing kids these days having supportive parents brings me hope. 

I’m sure there are some childrens books on gender identity you can find. Not quite related but there is a really cute picture book about a drag queen for children and in my opinion it explores feeling like a girl and a boy and that’s okay.

As someone who was a trans child (ftm) it depends on the person, but I remember feeling that way as a child but I couldn’t really “explain” or “know” how I felt until I was older. In the long run I found out it was gender dysphoria because I wanted to be like all the other little boys etc.

As for what I wish my parents did when I was younger- I wish they would have been supportive and let me play with and dress how I wish. There’s no rush to figuring out gender identity as it is very wide spectrum. 

It personally took me a long confusing time because my parents were conservative and I wasn’t allowed to “know about things like that” to figure out I was transgender. So I think you are doing everything right so far. 

As for worrying about bullies as a young child there should not be that much kids angry or bullying your child, they might be confused but you could give him some examples of what to tell them. 

As your child gets older it does pose a concern in bullying in school but I found that changing my name helps a lot. I was fairly “good” at passing at school and wasn’t bullied much but it does pose a concern especially for transgender women. 

As they get older you could bring them to a gender therapist, that helped me a-lot in figuring out who I was.

Your an amazing parent and I wish you and your child luck on your journey.
That's a great idea! I'm not sure why I haven't already thought of that. Thank you!
Thank you! Have you found any support locally? I have no idea how to find support at this young of an age. I would love to join a group of parents with young gender non-conforming kids, but I'm not sure where to look. 

Does your daughter wear ""girl"" clothes to school? How have other kids treated her at this age?
[removed]
You're definitely right about it being difficult having a little boy wearing girls clothing. I have a friend whose daughter prefers boy clothes and everyone tells her that she's being cute, but people definitely think it's different when my son wants to wear dresses.

That's a good idea to check with the school first. I'm really unsure how other 5 year olds would treat him, but I'm sure some older kids would be more likely to bully him.
5 is too young. I don’t know when the last time you’ve socialized with a 5 year old was, but I’ve spoken to multiple 5 year olds relatively recently. They are too young for this.
[removed]
I haven't really explained what trans is to him yet, but I'm going to look for some age appropriate books. I think he will be so excited to learn about it.

I'm sorry you didn't have more supportive parents. I'm not trans, but I've had a lot of other issues that my parents didn't understand and were not supportive of in any way. I honestly don't think I really know how to parent, but I'm just doing my best to make sure he feels loved and supported no matter which gender he ends up being.
I was trying to find a subreddit like that, thank you so much!
I'll check it out, thank you!
That's really good to hear that they've had an overall good experience in school! I think the area I live in has a good mix of people who would be supportive and those who wouldn't, but it really only takes one person to make a kid's life miserable in school unfortunately. I'm just hoping he will make a bunch of friends who love his dresses.
I will definitely do my best to listen to him.  I'm not really sure what the ""gender critical"" groups try to push, but I'm really only interested in following my son's lead about who he is. I just want to try support him while also preparing him for people who might not be nice and understanding... which he will inevitably encounter.
Yes, I definitely want to allow him to figure it out. I don't even want to label him as ""transgender"" or anything at all until he tells me what he feels is right for him. I just know that he's most definitely showing a lot of signs that he's happiest presenting as a girl so I'm just trying to figure out how to support him with that as best that I can.
He was always stealing her dresses until we finally bought him his own. I don't think he technically knows what transgender means yet either, but he's showed me over and over again that he feels like he's a girl.

I hope your parents have become more supportive, and if not, I hope you've been able to find better people to surround yourself with!
Thanks! I will probably speak to the school if he wants to start wearing his dresses. He does know that people might be mean sometimes, and we will definitely try and work on ways to handle bullies although I'm really dreading that as he starts kindergarten soon.
Yeah, we will probably look into this. Thanks!
It is, thank you!
Yeah, we are definitely trying our best to support him.    Thanks!
Thank you! Your experience sounds very similar to my son's but in reverse! I'm glad you and your parents were able to find a good compromise!
I can't imagine trying to raise him in the 80's! I can't imagine how awful the bullying must have been.

I feel fortunate that more people are accepting of gender differences than ever before. We have many friends who are 100% supportive no matter if he wears dresses and identifies as a boy or a girl. It's so nice to be able to find other like-minded people.
We haven't really explained trans people to him yet so I think we are going to try and introduce it with books or something. I think he feels a lot of frustration that most people see him as a boy when he very much feels like a girl. I think letting him know that he has options in regards to pronouns and such might help to relieve some of his frustration.
This is very helpful, thank you! I have a feeling he will be very excited when I explain that he can be a girl. It's a small town so he already knows a lot of kids, but I will just see what he wants and if changing pronouns is something that he would like to try.
[removed]
I'm so glad to hear that some kids are able to go to school without issues! I'm in the US and there's certainly a decent amount of people in the area who would not be nice, but I'm doing my best to only be around supportive people.

I'm also sorry you didn't have support. I struggled with having support as a child too (for different issues) so I'm doing my best to try and be supportive of my kids. I just want them to feel OK with who they are.
Yeah, the bullying is really the biggest concern at this age. He would LOVE to show off his dresses, but I think he already knows that kids can be mean. He's still been ok with wearing boy clothes to school for now so we will just try and follow his lead.
Yeah, we will definitely seek out a therapist if he struggles in school.
meant to add

you’re not wrong for continuing to use he/him for your child! i just default to neutral until i have confirmation on someone’s pronouns just to be safe, that’s why i put the asterisk next to they
[removed]
>Sissy: A Coming-of-Gender Story

Loved that book, but it's really for someone much older; a lot of it takes place in college.
We definitely don't plan to push him to label himself as ""trans"" or anything else he's not comfortable with. Right now, he's just a boy who loves dresses and all things ""girly"". That being said, he will still likely face bullies at this age for not being gender-conforming. 

It's a little hard trying to find a support group due to his age and because I don't want to give him a label yet since he's not old enough to identify it himself. I just know that right now, he very strongly relates to being a female, and I just want to support him with that as best that I can... even if it might eventually change.
Ah yes, the life-altering decisions of... wearing feminine clothes and maybe being called a different name and pronouns. I can't possibly think how these could be reversed, they'll truly be permanent changes that they can never go back on /s
Stop drinking the Kool-Aid and actually learn something. Absolutely NOTHING that the parent(s) mentioned is life-altering. NOTHING. They're just letting the kid roll how he wants to.
Nobody is claiming they're trans because nobody except them can know for sure. All anyone can do is listen to their child and let them explore, like you're saying. If they turn out to be trans then that's fine, and likewise if they don't. But you have to let them explore as much as they need for them to discover that.
Tell us some more how you’ve never talked to trans people or done research
I don't think being trans is something you ""allow"". I don't know if he will be a trans adult, but he's old enough to know how he feels and what he likes to wear. He's also old enough to understand whether or not I support him as he is. His understanding of himself will be a process, but at age five, he feels happiest presenting himself as a girl so I'm going to support him with it. If it changes in the future, then that's fine too.
Thank you so much. It makes me so sad to hear how many have not had supportive parents. My parents were not supportive of a lot of things that I struggled with (not gender issues) so I learned the hard way how important it is to have support from your family.

We're definitely trying our best to support him no matter which gender he eventually decides is best. I think he should feel comfortable exploring his identity, and I'm trying my best to help him with that. It really sucks when society isn't always supportive, but I hope it's getting better.

Thank you so much for your response!
While this book isn't specifically about being trans, it definitely ticks a lot of the boxes. It's about a blue crayon that was accidentally given a red wrapper, and how hard it is when everyone else refuses to look past your labeling.

Hey, trans parent of a probably trans child here! Good books we got for our kids included: 

It Feels Good to be Yourself

Red - A Crayons Tale

My Princess Boy

When Aiden Became a Brother 

Introducing Teddy

I Am Jazz

And for my husband and I we read The Transgender Child. The thought these days is that gender identity has three distinct developmental milestones. Roughly 4-6 years, 11-13 years, and 17-19 years. It's definitely possible that your child is trans, but even if they aren't supporting them now is still the most important thing you can do. They'll always remember how you helped them, regardless of where they end up in the end.
It's probably above the kid's reading level, but I'm a big fan of Were I Not a Girl.
PFLAG often has local groups and lots of information online. The Trevor Project is also a great resource for parents looking for information. You might try a web search to see if there is an LGBTQ inclusion center in your area, they often have various types of meetings/activities and can likely help you find other resources in your area. You’re on the right track already, your child is lucky to have you!
We joined Transforming Families. I don’t know if it’s a regional thing. We recently found a psychologist who does group sessions for parents and kids, but haven’t started yet. I think we go next month for our first appt. Childrens Hospital has a program with a two year waitlist, so we’re on that. I think it’s important to sign up early and get a doctor in case you decide to she needs puberty blockers at some point. But this is also going to depend on where you live I think. I’ll DM you more details.

I’m terms of clothes, my wife recently started providing more options in the dresser. These were girl cloths towards the gender neutral side. She immediately started wearing them. She’s also fond of stealing her older sisters clothes. So we’ve been adding more and more “girl” clothes. She likes anything and everything with girl style; a frill, sparkle, tapered cut, whatever. She has some dresses too. We recently found undies that for boys but have a style more like panties. 

My daughter has a twin brother and they share a dresser. My son picks out all the “boy” clothes to wear. My daughter picks out the “girl” clothes; Even though it’s all mixed. They each have their own style and it reflects their gender identities.
Username checks out.
honestly it's better to explain the situation to him and the teacher (and most likely face some bullying) instead of restricting expression to prevent that. a great home environment can make a WORLD of a difference despite anything that happens outside. wether or not he's trans it definitely can't hurt, he'll be so thankful when he's older. you're doing incredible!!
Statically, 3 is the age at which someone is able to effectively communicate their own gender.
You start to learn what your gender is at about 2 and then learn to communicate or even express it at 3
A newborn doesn't understand what hunger is and is still able to comunicate when it needs to eat. Comunication doesn't mean they need to be able to give a presentation on the subject, only that they are able to convey their feelings. 

A 3yo can absolutely start to complain about the color of their clothes, or the length of their hair or being grouped with the boys at school and not the girls. That's precisely what happened in op's case.
I work with kids of all ages (kids TV), and kids this young definitely have an idea of gender. Spend a day in a kindergarten and you'll hear enough boy/girl talk.     
     
They might not have a full understanding of gender, but I'd wager most kids know that girls wear dresses and boys don't (according to society).
Funny, you seem to not understand what hypocrisy is, yet you're perfectly able to communicate your ability to use it.
Where did you get this information?
They link to articles that have been found to use fraudulent data or coercion to ""prove"" that letting trans people transition (even socially) makes them unhappy and is dangerous. Make sure you look into sources by doctors and academics if you get sent an article or study that seems concerning and alarming to you to see if the study isn't a fraudulent study from the 80s.
The important thing is to let him know that trans people exist and what the deal is (In an age appropriate way) without leading him to any conclusions, don't ask leading questions or anything.

(You might find this site useful for your own reading https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en I put off reading it until just now and it seems very good so far.)

I didn't know what a trans person even was until I was 18 or 19. And even then the explanation was bad... If I knew then what I know now I'd have known I was trans whe. I was about 12, instead of coming out to myself at 25 and then talking myself out of it until I turned 32. I feel like I've wasted so much of my life because of a simple lack of knowledge...
Glad i could help, best of luck to you and to your child
How is having a supportive parent scary lol?
This is the best thing you can do and you are doing an amazing job. Supporting who your child is really does help. I know things are bad in some places in the US and I feel sorry for all the trans people who are going through awful times atm
[deleted]
Your welcome! I hope you figure everything out! :)
Oh that's a good one! I'm going to add it to my list of books to buy him.  Thanks!
Thank you for all the suggestions! I think he's going to be really excited to read about kids like him.
Another one to look into is George by Alex Gino.

Edit: They changed the name to Melissa to reflect the main characters identity.
I might have his older brother read it or we can all read it together. Thanks!
Thank you, I will check those out!
By her 6th birthday she was insistent that she was a girl and it became clear that using she/her pronouns were very important. She sees herself as a girl/daughter/sister, and corrects any misgendering. I only recently became aware that this was an issue at school. Her teacher is on board now, but like the rest of us, was slow to catch up. I think all the kids are adjusting. So far, no major issues with other kids. But the kids are also adjusting. I wish I had figured this out BEFORE kindergarten started, but oh well, here we are.
Thank you for the information! Your daughter's experience does sound a lot like my son's. Did she start asking you to change pronouns or did you guys just start using them? My son hasn't asked for me to switch pronouns or to stop referring to him as my ""son"" yet so I'm just following his lead for now. If he feels like that's what he needs, then we will use whatever he's most comfortable with.

Have you had any issues with other people being rude to you or your daughter?
Statistically, a dog is as intelligent as a 3 year old, and dogs are VERY dumb. 3 year olds don’t understand enough about anything to make such a big decision. It’s very easy for a 3 year old boy to say “I’m a boy” when the only things they have to compare themselves too is probably girls. They can understand the difference between the 2 because 3 year old boys have always been referred to as boys their entire life, and understand their physical characteristics match other boys and not other girls.

Sorry off topic but OHMYGODDESS we're Avatar twins!
I think the thought of a decent parent is scary to them…
Yeah, I'm definitely not in the most progressive area, but there's still some good people around.
And if the 5 year old consistently tells you don’t you think they should be able to make nonpermanent decisions regarding how they look and identify
Absolutely! And I think you're right. The thing that messed me up the most as a kid was never seeing anyone like me represented anywhere. Feeling invisible made it seem like what I was was just so bad that it couldn't even be talked about. Representation is incredibly important.
I am certain no matter what, it would be nice to ask your child whatever pronouns they'd like to use. Kids around this age are not familiar with how refering to them makes an impact.

Simply I'd go and ask your child ""how would you like me to refer to you? as my son, or a daughter?"" nothing too complicated. If your child chooses the daughter option or is very hesitant, i'd recommend calling them a gender neutral version of their name.

I am a trans person myself, in my 15s. I have not known what 'pronouns, gender identity' and such were until i got bullied for liking women before coming out as a male in 4th grade. I had no idea people would have issues with either who i find attractive nor how i'd like to identify.
I think it's important to try to talk to your child about this and explain it. I personally have not had supportive parents and got disowned, so i'm really glad you are willing to help your child out, finding out their identity together.

It's completely normal to know at such young age. I knew too. But it's important to find a psychologist to talk to, maybe contact sexuological department and see. No pressure, as long as your child enjoys life and is happy right now. take it slow.
It's not about intelligence

It's about the ability to speak.

Gender IS NOT BASED ON PHYSICAL CHARACTERISTICS

Gender is an internal function of the brain and the brain is **VERY** good at recognizing its own gender.

Recognition and communication of one's own gender doesn't require intellect, it requires sapience. Please stop being ableist.

Your argument is completely demolished by the last 30 years of science. On the one hand, you may want to stop to save yourself embarrassment.

On the other hand, please continue so I can continue giving you shovels to help you continue digging that hole of yours.
Cultural anthropology student here! Current research indicates that children are able to categorize cultural depictions of masculine and feminine by 18-24 months. They typically are able to categorize their own gender identity and presentation desires by age 3, despite having only a limited ability to communicate such complex topics. Having the verbiage to express something does not necessarily dictate your conceptualization of it.
Literally every adult is constantly talking to children about gender, all day every day. Princesses and tonka trucks and all this shit that probably shouldn't be gendered, but absolutely is. You seem to have a very unhealthy misunderstanding of the fact that children are whole people from *very* young and are far more insightful than you say here. Read some things, any things, about child psychology.
Ah yes, because lacking an understanding of sexual reproduction means you can't have any idea of your own gender. Let's assume you're right, then shouldn't we raise all children as gender neutral until they're old enough to understand? If not, why does letting them wear whatever clothes they like and calling them what they want to be called make a difference? Surely treating them as any gender would be equally incorrect if they don't know yet? How do children know to use male or female pronouns for other people is they don't understand gender at all? Why do some children bully boys who wear dresses if they don't understand what a boy is? Honestly, I think you're underestimating the intelligence of young children, and certainly their ability to express parts of their identity, even if they don't understand it fully. It's really not much different at that age from expressing a preference for food or clothing, and I'm sure you can't disagree that 3 year olds can have those preferences.
Well maybe you were just slower than other kids. Have you since learned that your asshole is not the same thing as a hole in the ground?

Dude, kids are not as dumb as you think. Looking back, at the time I didn’t know that trans people existed but I knew I was a girl by 3

By about 4 I knew what pregnancy was, but that is knowledge to be taught not self awareness or brain development. It’s a proven fact that a child’s brain is developing its gender and identity at 2 and typically conveying that to others by 3. 

What is wrong with you? Do you think all children are dumb? Or are just assuming because you were dumb as a child and still are?
Oh for sure and hopefully with each new generation there’ll be more and more people accepting of people like me. Who just want to live our lives in peace. I’m lucky in that I can do that now. Mostly. I get abuse online now and again. Always from men. I have found a beauty group on Facebook and they have been so supportive and helpful with makeup tips and general skincare. And even just to chat about life in general. Their attitude is that all women are valid and supported. It really helps me ☺️
[deleted]
That's so sad. I had OCD as a kid, and I remember feeling completely alone and didn't know there were other people like me. I think it would have made a huge difference in my life had I known, and I hope it will be the same for him in regards to his gender.
Yes! Ok kind of a vent but whatever. When I was about 17 I saw an episode of ""Der Lehrer"" (the teacher) on tv and the episode was about a transboy, coming to terms that he's trans, and I bawled my eyes out for like 2 hours and I wrote with a friend about how happy I was seeing some trans representation on tv.
I hope it keeps getting better for you! Even if my son doesn't end up being trans, we are teaching all three of our children about differences in gender expression so hopefully there will at least be 3 more supportive people in the future!
There’s nothing wrong with letting someone that age express themselves. Nobody’s sending them off to get surgery.
I'm sure it will be helpful for you kiddo. You're doing every right here

Today was a day of so many check marks of things I would have previously never done in fear of being shunned. I went shopping on my own as a girl for girl clothes for the first time, I went to the pub as a girl with some friends for the first time and even went to the right toilet. I'm so happy.

Holy fuck youre so pretty and i feel like u pass rlly welll
Good for you friend!!!! From one internet stranger to another I'm super proud of you🖤!!
and looked gorgeous doing it! i am so proud of you, friend.
Oh yeah if people have double pony tail advice about the last pic that would be super appreciated.
Omg you look like Uraraka
You look very nice :)
Looking like that, my biggest concern would be creeps hitting on you... Congratulations! Those are all big steps to feeling normal.
You're so pretty, I love your hair colour!

This makes me smile. I can’t wait until girls like you barely even remember their firsts. Their first kiss, their first car, their first pet. Not their first time using the toilet.

Either way I am happy for you.
I've been meaning to cosplay her since so many people have said that at this point now!

Its a wig so I definitely don't have the full credit there but ty!

"I'm a trans boy, but I like wearing ""girly"" clothes (he/him)"	"Saying that I'm a boy feels natural. I see myself as a boy. I feel sick when people address me as a girl, because that's not me. But as a kid, I did enjoy ""girly"" clothes or accessories. My sister keeps questioning why I liked wearing them if I'm a boy. I never thought about why. I just liked it. I didn't only wear clothes from the girls aisle though. I think even cisgender boys should be able to wear feminine clothing. But why does my sister keep acting like it was unnatural? Is it unnatural? Should I act like a stereotypical boy in order to say I'm trans? That doesn't feel natural either. I just am who I am. Did any of you also like things that are typically for your assigned sex?

Edit: Thank you all for your comments! I feel much more comfortable in my identity now. I will definitely show some of them to my sister the next time she says something about it. I love you all, and remember that you're appreciated. <33 Have a great day."	"That’s totally okay! Gender isn’t a hard line! You can be a boy who like girly things or clothes! That doesn’t make you any less of a man!
you don’t owe anybody to dress a certain way except yourself. who cares if you like traditionally feminine clothing? sometimes that stuff looks really nice and can make you feel comfortable about yourself because YOU look good in it. i’m also afab trans man and i still like wearing some traditionally female clothing because it makes me feel good to look good. at the end of the day, your own happiness and comfort is more important than you pleasing others. :) be you and be true
Clothes don’t have genders and you can wear what you want
r/ftmfemininity
I FEEL THE SAME like i hate being feminine as a girl BUT BEING FEMININE AS A BOY?? BEST FEELING EVER
hey man - when i first got my binder I started just putting on random shirts & hoodies to see how they looked, i at one point put on a dress & MAN did it feel good to be flat & look fairly masc in a dress. you might enjoy the sub r/FTMfemininity .

also dont beat yourself up over not showing many signs as a kid, not everyone does, i didnt really, anything I did was so minimal im not even sure it was a sign of transness.
I was in a relationship with a trans man years ago who was also a drag queen.

You being you is important, nothing else matters.
Bro it is totally fine, no different than girls who like wearing ""boy"" clothes. People dont think twice when a Cis women wears jeans and a boysih tea shirt, so dont let them tell you twice when you wanna wear ""girly"" items, do what makes you happy king!
Cis guys can be femboys, so trans guys can too.
It may be difficult to explain to people but who cares? It's your life and there's nothing wrong with a trans man wearing feminine clothes.

Edit: I'm transfeminine and I enjoy several masculine things. One thing I'm sure you already know is that gender is very largely a social construct and thus it may feel more natural and appealing to not always conform to said construct.
The problem is that a cis person who enjoys wearing clothes of any gender, or doing activities typically done by any gender, is just going to be seen as a cis person wearing clothes and doing activities. A trans person who does that, apparently, is opening themselves up to having their identity questioned. I fucking hate it, and it's revolting. But I keep seeing it happen. And like, being honest, I do want to wear nail polish. Lots of cis guys are wearing nail polish lately. But if I did it? Honestly I'm kind of worried someone would be like, oh, you changed your mind? Like, no, I didn't. I'm just who I am, I'm me, and who I am is a guy who likes to do stuff, and that sometimes includes wearing nail polish. Like why the fuck not? I don't owe conformity, predictability, masculinity or femininity to anyone. Fuck them. Wish I could brush it off that easy though lmao. I hope you're able to move on without having so much of my own hang ups, my dude. You're a guy, that's all there is to it. :) And the kind of guy you are is entirely up to you. :)
That is totally fine and you are very valid.
Fuck gender roles. Be who you want to be. It’s a free world, explore it.
I thought it wasn’t normal for me too cause I’m also a trans boy but I really love wear dresses! Gender doesn’t equate to clothing! It’s perfectly fine to wear whats considered girly as a man
Down with gender norms!!
I understand the feeling you have and it isn't unnatural to want to wear feminie clothes,  but clothes dont have a gender, but in the end be you and if you wear feminie clothes but want to be known as a guy is perfectly fine.

Also you dont need anyone's permission to wear the clothes you want :)
 (Sorry if this seems conviluding)
bro for the longest time when i was “a girl” i only wore shorts and graphic tees and jeans and sneakers. now that i’m identifying as a boy i want to wear a skirt so bad! honestly. if it makes you happy it doesn’t need to make sense to anyone else
i think there are cis people who easily understand transition in the context of stereotypical gender roles but have a harder time with people who transition and dont stick to a gender binary.
I’m a trans woman who likes boy things, life is weird that way
Transitioning was the thing that made me embrace my ""feminine"" side, although I don't like to call it that, lol. It was only after I started presenting masc that I got earrings for example. If anything, my feminine habits/accessories/... are an expression of my masculinity, at least to me. The conviction that whatever I do, I'll still be my gender, is extremely freeing
That's awesome and valid as fuck!

You can be a hugely manly man and wear a sundress if ya want!
It’s not unnatural at all! You don’t have to be a stereotypical boy to say that you’re trans, sure some people fall into those stereotypes (I myself fall into several transfem ones) but there are also people that don’t, and that’s okay. There are even plenty of cis boys that enjoy wearing fem clothes. r/feminineboys is a very accepting place with likeminded individuals if you’re interested in exploring more.
i am also a very feminine trans guy!! and no matter what anyone tells you, youre totally valid. enjoy yourself! who will if not you?
I'm a trans girl who plays Magic the Gathering. Trust me gender stereotypes don't matter.
I've struggled with the inverse of this, am I a trans woman? Or do I just think gender norms are stupid.

You do you boo, if it makes you happy go after it.
Nothing wrong with wearing what you wana wear. Gender is a spectrum and fuck traditional gendered clothes
Clothing doesn't have gender! You can be a man and still wear stereotypically women's clothing, and vice versa. The concept of gendered clothing has changed back and fourth a fair few times over the years.
Clothes don't have gender, dress however you like! I change between femme presenting and masc presenting depending on my mood on any given day and I'm AFAB transmasc non-binary (they/he)
When I was first coming out to myself, I took a lot of inspiration from feminine guys. I felt exactly the same as you.
You can be femboy, does your sister know 'bout that? Y'know, 'bout femboys?
/r/FTMFemininity is calling your name.
Same here. I love skirts(especially the spiny ones) and I love doing my make up and shopping and most other “girly things” it’s not unnatural at all! Sadly tho a lot of people(including other trans ppl sometimes) feel the same as your sister. Just do your best to ignore them and wear whatever you want <3333
Rain: You're sister is being close minded tbh, ohh and if you want to talk to some kindred spirits in that regard check out r/FTMfeminity.
there's no such things as girlsh and boyish, wear whatever makes you feel happy!!:) hope you have  a great dayyy
I as a demiboy (he/they)can definitely relate! I can’t wear dresses because it makes me want to scream but I like wearing thigh highs, makeup, and skirts. If I’m being honest when I lose words I’ll talk through songs. You should definitely listen to “gender is boring” by she/her/hers. I know it’s on the other side of things mtf instead of ftm but I feel like you’ll relate. At least I could. :) gender is a construct anyway! Dress how you want man! Be you! <3
r/FTMfemininity come join us! We're all like you and want to dress feminine sometimes but want to be perceived as either male or non-binary.
I’m a boy who loves “girly” things too!! You are who you are and that’s totally okay. You can like/dislike whatever you want, no one can decide who you are but you!! 💗
Gender isn't a binary thing,

It's ok to sit in the middle,

Or even just enjoy certain clothes, Styles, activities, Even if people will try to gender them

I'm a cis dude (Here so I can understand my surprising number of trans friends better)
And I got me a women's jumper just yesterday lmao. (and I love wearing it)
Same here! Nothing wrong with you. Gender expression isn't the same as gender identity. Gender expression is whatever you want it to be and it doesn't invalidate your Gender identity
Femboy moment
I used to when I was little because shiny sparkle=me likey haha
I like pew pews an fishin.. doesn't mean my tiddie growin any less
From age 3 I knew I was a boy. And yet I didn’t need to stop wearing girls clothes or liking pink or playing with Barbies. I knew even then that none of those things suddenly changed my gender. Unfortunately, because I kept all of this to myself and just lived my toddler life liking girly things, my mom refuses to accept my transition and assumes something traumatized me when I was younger and set me on this path.
I wear men’s clothes as a trans girl sometimes, but I don’t like half of them

Clothes aren’t really part of the internal sense of gender that gender identity is, that’s the big socially constructed part of gender
Honestly, I was the same as you. It took me a few years to finally take my friends' advice to 'screw the transphobes and wear feminine things if you want'. 

I would take my time with feeling comfortable around people like you have described. 

I hope this helps! 
:]
Next time your sister asks you this, why don't you ask her why she wears trousers?
My boyfriend is very much the same. He enjoys both masc and fem clothing. Sometimes he’ll show up in a dress and the other times in pants and suit. As someone who is also trans, I enjoy masc clothes too like suits and stuff those stuff are just hot and charismatic and even though my internalized conservative doesn’t like wearing it bc its a traditionally male clothing, I still love how it looks. So, as others mentioned, dont worry about it! You can wear whatever you want and it doesn’t make you any less valid!
Clothes have no gender. Anyone can where whatever they want.
i relate to this. i favor masculine terms and pronouns used on me but i also like st femme clothes coz a) pretty and b) stylish and a wider variety of aesthetics. you are 100% allowed to like wearing anything you want and it shouldn't affect who you truly are, if you wanna wear something femme, go for it!
I'm a trans girl and one working on cars, yet I'm still all girl
I think clothing both can and shouldn’t be associated with gender. Yes, it’s okay to associate it with gender if you’re like wearing gender-affirming attire, but a lot of other times it’s a little oppressive to gender clothing. I’m not accusing you of this though! You are a boy, no matter what it is you decide to wear. Hell, I’m a cisgender guy and I really love wearing skirts! Do what makes you happy ❤️
Just like many of us transfems are tomboys, a part of you can be a femboy.
sammmmeee. I feel like a boy, Iv always seen myself as a boy, but I like masc and fem things, and my mom things its a faze cause of that. Im upsett because Girly things was the only thing I was ever tought to love when I was little. I just existed.
Clothes dont equal your gender! one of my classmates is a cis guy and he wears skirts a lot to school yet he says he still feels like a boy. Im like that too, im non binary and i like feminine clothes more than gender neutral or masculine clothes.
Same, I still imagine myself dancing in pretty dresses and don’t have a problem with feminine clothes, but I know I am a man.
Yeahhh society can be annoying. It's *generally* fine these days for girls to do masculine things, but boys doing feminine stuff is still regularly ridiculed.

Being trans only makes things worse
Clothes don’t really have a gender, people just decided they did at some point. It used to be the norm to dress boys up in, well, dresses, up until they were nearly teens iirc just a few generations back. Not sure why the trend died out. We can see a similar trend with names. Like my uncle, a cis man, was named Candy, as that was a man’s (or at least more gender neutral) name when his parents picked it.
Don’t feel pressured to fit into a binary you don’t vibe with, just wear what you like and are comfortable with!
There is no clothing requirement to be trans!

The clothes you’re wearing are *your* clothes, so they’re boy’s clothes.

My son is a trans boy and likes wearing dresses from time to time.

I’m a trans woman and I don’t wear makeup, nor do I dress very fem
I was just think about this I'm ftm who loves to wear dresses the thing is I want to be seen as a boy in a dress rather than a girl in a dress. I'm glad I'm not the only one. :)
It's absolutely okay and valid to be transmasc and want to connect with your femininity in a way that makes sense to you & your identity. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise
I get it I am mtf and im still a tomboy. I like cool pants and more masc vibes alot
I'm a trans girl and I like wearing ""boyish"" clothes. Lots of cis men wear dresses or makeup or jewelry, lots of cis girls wear baggy jeans, short hair, and t-shirts. All valid. You're fine.
Fuck gender roles my guy
Gender is stupid, do whatever you want.
I think your head is on straight and your sister is just looking for some reason you're not trans. Plenty of boys enjoy pretending to be girls when they're kids--before society teaches them that they have to fulfill rigid gender standards or lose status. How are you any different?
Cis boys can like fem things.

Trans boys can like fem things.

My trans guy self likes fem things.

Boys can like fem things.

Thanks for coming to my ted talk
You are a boy, what you wear is your decision. You don’t have to stick to any stereotypes, just be yourself :)
Wearing clothes that you like, no matter what gender you are, is all that matters
Hey that's totally fine, even better its cool! I'm the same way but I'm preT so I have the natural fear that I'll be misgendered. That's subreddit is very helpful! Lots of love to you!!! 💙

BTW I plan to get Testosterone
If you like this kind of clothing, then you just like it. There is absolutely nothing wrong with expressing yourself how you see fit.
You've got more courage than most guys. It's not uncommon that a thread will pop up in something like AskReddit about guys wearing skirts and pretty much everyone wishes they would, but the reality is that, while guys wish they could, no one wants to be the first to do it.

Plus, it's not like feminine men don't exist. If there can be tomboys, then it only makes sense that the opposite would be true as well. It doesn't make you any less of a man.
You're a boy. They're your clothes. They're boy clothes by default
You're not alone there.  I had a huge arguement with myself about my dress shoes, some part of me convinced that if I was to be a man, they had to go.  But I love them!  Eventually I realised that I was being a bit silly, especially since I already knew that boys wear flats and heels sometimes and other ""women's"" clothes, too, and that it's perfectly okay.  The moment I gave myself permission to keep my ""girly"" shoes, was the moment that I accepted my identity as a trans man.  Give yourself permission to wear what makes you happy.
Im in the same situation and sometimes it gets annoying cause someone will make a comment like ""pick a department to shop"" or something about confusing them, the best I can explain it is I really enjoy feeling masculine but I still like to feel pretty and for me pretty means dresses and skirts and crop tops.
This is coming from a non-binary person that has been confused for a girl since they like girly things



gender is a social construct, you are a boy, A boy who likes girly things. Everyone can like the things they like and still be who they are. I sometimes wear skirts but I’m still non-binary. You don’t owe anyone masculinity, and if anyone feels like you do then f them!
I'm a trans man reaching my late twenties and I still feel exactly the same as you. Just try your best to explain to her the difference between gender and gender expression, and that both are inherent to you. What you put on your body or touch with your body, doesn't change what gender you want your body to be. It is like asking why the peel of an orange is different than the inside of an orange. They're both part of the orange, but the outside peel doesn't mean the inside has to be more peel. Terrible analogy, but I hope that helps. If she doesn't understand, no matter how you try to explain, it is best to just leave it be and to look for acceptance elsewhere. Hopefully she will come around when she sees you living your best life, but some people don't want to understand, so there is no point in forcing it. I know it is difficult and I am sorry. ❤
BIG SAME. literally me. i love dresses and makeup and the colour pink but it just worsens the misgendering.
Clothing isn’t natural so you wearing “girly” clothes isn’t natural but neither are the clothes she’s wearing or the clothes I’m wearing. Clothing choices are cultural and that means whether something is masculine or feminine is a matter of opinion and not any kind of natural law.
Cute 🥰
Gender is literally not real it can be whatever you want it to be
So you’re a boy, who presents fem… I feel like there could be a term for this… boyfem perhaps?
thank you, max <3
Facts!
Ehh they kinda do, but I totally get what you’re saying lol 

Anyone should be able to wear anything
I was about to link this subreddit too!
I was making sure someone linked the sub and misread your name as anticapitalismfetish
Rain: Same, except this system is all trans tomboys. 😄
This right here. ^^🙌
... I have to try this now.
You took the words out my mouth. fuck gender norms.
this is exactly how i feel. i think my sister questions if I'm actually trans because I was pretty feminine as a child. Now that I'm out, I tend to not wear girly things as much. Just because I'm afraid of being misgendered or told it's a phase. Like one time I bought earrings, and my sister decided to say ""But aren't those kind of girly?"" Just let me live, bro 😭
Well take for example a skirt. If a man wears one say in Italy there’s probably gonna be some old fashioned people shaking their heads. But if you wear a skirt with a nice pattern in Scotland it’s called a kilt and it’s absolutely fine. Clothes don’t have genders it’s just traditions and what people make them.
Yes but that’s determined by culture and not any kind of natural order of the world. So whether someone likes a frilly dress or jeans and a t-shirt isn’t based on any kind of internal concept of identity but it may be based on a desire to “pass” as a specific gender in public.
It's been helpful to me when I feel especially dysphoric or ""not trans enough!"" Thought it might be useful to share
I mean if the shoe fits, lol
But that’s a kilt
It’s skirt shaped I’m not good at making sense
lol I’m just joshin

I never watch, its nice to listen to music which is super quite. Almost not there yet keeps you company. Utter bliss for me to collect my thoughts
Yeah, most of the time I just have sounds of people screaming at each other
Oh that sucks! Maybe some headphones? When your in the tub it could be your little space away from the world
Nah , don't have wireless headphones rn and my parents wouldn't allow it
Ah that's a shame, well maybe you can find quite areas in another place? Just somewhere you can enjoy the quite music

They were from stadium and brand is soc but no clue what they were called. They are pushup bra, that's for sure. So I am sad that i couldn't find you the link
Aww thanks, all of these comments have lifted my mood a bit, I have been feeling down because my partner is in 4h away for now,she is back in Monday so these comments just made my whole week
no problem :))
that hair is incredibly similar to mine, actually. Especially if I put mine in a ponytail. I swear that one of the only differences is that mine is definitely darker. You look amazing btw and are totally goals

Oh im sorry i only would be sweet for youre great posting 🤗😊
You are sweet😋☺️
Girlfriend eh? Honestly that's what keep me from this community for so long, I figured that if I was a girl I should like Guys, since I didn't I figured I wasn't......it took me an unreasonable amount of time to realize that you could be both trans and Lesbian.

Sounds like you found a good one, how long have you been together?
❤️
I am as sweet as a strawberry jam but I am as spicy as a jalopeno
almost a year
Yeah, i remember that thought. I was too just like no I can't like girls but It didn't take long for me to figure this out though that i can like girls, though I really don't know my romantic attraction, I don't like anyone sexually
😍❤🤗
That sounds really good and that's the perfect mix 🔥☺️😋
true, my partner is as spicy as a habanero

I feel comfortable with the clothes I want		"Thanks so much for making this. It perfectly describes how I feel. And I am glad I'm not the only one seeing it that way.
I’m a trans male and if I want to wear a skirt and crop top I will I don’t have to wear “manly” clothes if I don’t want to
No trans person ought to feel like they have something to prove. Just live an authentic life, that's the goal, right?

I do personally wish I looked feminine enough to pull off feminine clothes, but I really don't like attracting attention. I'll just wear what's comfy, which is a mix
Hell yeah!!!! Fuck all those people, that say clothes have a gender. Ill wear what i damn well please wether i pass or not even if i look like a guy in a dress or a chick in a cowboy hat and chaps.
YeSssss, this.
A big regret of mine is that I didn't really experiment with fashion when I was younger because I wanted to present as masculine-agender as possible. Now I feel like I'm getting past the age where it's socially acceptable to try weird new looks.
Yaassss! Go cowgirl!
Yes. The whole point of intentionally wearing gendered clothing is defeated if you feel too uncomfortable. Try dressing very male or female but most people would prefer to just do what is comfortable. I think as others have said that is most important to not fall into the trap of trying to dress as one gender completely at the cost of comfort.
What's funny is that wearing alt and some pretty masc clothes makes me pass better than wearing like typically feminine clothes 😂 (mtf)
I need to learn this, but my trouble comes looking at myself at all and seeing the opposite of what I want to see or the image of myself I want to. So I end up wearing dresses and my makeup to cover the things I wish I could be rid of.
Agree^.^
Soooo true! For me this is reverse :D I like cute clothes and feminine colors. I refuse to dress masc, I will continue to shop from the girls section because I like what I like. If cis people can wear masc/fem clothing trans people can too regardless of gender.
If you aren’t comfortable, then reach the point where you are and stop trying to reach other people’s standards. If you stop moving forward, then you will only sink into despair
Just chaps and a hat? I like your style! 😜 Lol
The cowgirl aesthetic is highly underrated imo, low key had a bit of a crush on Mesa prime from warframe for like a week
Fuck socially acceptable, atleast by the majority standard. find a social circle where your style is acceptable

I really need to get used to other colors besides black, grey, and dark colors in general 🙄
😂your title is so relatable 😆
Big same, fr
Looking great! 

I often do the same now, even though before transitioning I'd always wear very colorful (still matching!) outfits whenever I could. 

Perhaps because I'm able to express my femininity in other ways I feel less need to now. Or maybe unconsciously I want to look smaller and blend in to the shadows... 🤔 ...no, it must be me channeling my inner goth girl again <adds heart choker to cart> 😋
Lol hey you do you! But at least the option of variety is there. I hate guy clothes, the options are basically
Tshirt & jeans,
Golf tee and slacks,
Formal.
Sometimes we're even allowed to wear shorts! But then you get mocked for being an adult in shorts because apparently having exposed calves is only for children or swimtrunks

Hey, black is where it's at

Aww ty. She’s gorgeous!

No, euphoria
I’ve repressed it all for too long, idk how old you are but plz listen to your gut.  If you’re a woman you go out and be that fucking woman.  This is coming from a tall 20 year old still closeted trans woman.  Plz be yourself.  I still don’t have the courage, but do this for yourself, if I can motivate one person to finally no longer feel bound to their bodies like a prisoner then so can fucking I.  We’ve got this and we can do this.
Your words resonate and uplift me! I’m turning 20 on the 19th. I’ve come out as nonbinary publicly but my best friend and boyfriend are the two people i’ve told I think i’m transfemme. I’ve found that when I feel alone and need an outlet to express my feelings, I write a journal entry. Journaling is cathartic and it allows for me to go read back and reflect, see how i’ve grown, and help my memory, as bad as it is. Let’s aim to achieve gender euphoria, and live our truth daily! :)"	n6unq7	trans	765	0.99	2021-05-07 09:37:15

Help supporting trans gf?	"My gf is questioning her gender, and she thinks she probably is trans (mtf). She tried on my clothes on our first date, so its not like this was completely unexpected, and I like women, so this change is not some big scary thing. I love her. I want to be as supportive as possible. 

We experiment with makeup and clothes and nails. We're basically living together, and we're sharing our closet. Sometimes I go with her shopping so she feels safe trying on fem clothing (we pretend its for me). But I wanna help in any way, shape or form. Does anyone know some extra ways I can support her? Tiny or big things I can do for her, to help her on this journey? 

Thank you so much in advance!!"	"It's sounds like you're perfect as is 🥰
OP: Reddit how can I be more supportive? 

Reddit: You already are Queen 👑.
You are absolute perfect gf, to have sb like you must be amazing 😊
You're doing great! My wife was very supportive when I came out and did a lot of the same things. 

One of the best things for me early on was using/trying out my new name and pronouns to see how it feels. You didn't mention doing this but I found it very helpful.
You seem like you’re doing 100% perfect. I’d give anything to have someone like you
You sound like a wonderful person to be as you are. Honestly, just keep doing as you're doing, and let things grow and flourish. Communication is a big deal so always be open, personally im  so insecure about pretty much everything so being able to talk and feel comfortable is huge. My biggest thing, personally, is encouragement. Wholeheartedly encourage your gf to dress or try on things or play with makeup/ nails, shopping, outings dressed etc, anything and everything as often as possible or that they want to. I say wholeheartedly, as in don't do it in a way that comes off as patronizing or tolerating. Most of all just don't change, bbe there for each other, and just keep being awesome❤❤❤
you already sound very supportive :) you could ask her about whether she wants to try a different name or names
You can’t improve on perfection. You’re amazing!
It sounds like you are doing an absolutely amazing job already. I can only add that my wife helped me with chosing the right name for me. But stay beautiful ❤️
I think you are doing an amazing job 🙂
Wow! Polar opposite of my partner in that situation 😂

You sound like you're doing everything very well as it is! I imagine she appreciates your support so much 🥰
You are doing the same things that my partner did for me when I came out. We have been together for 9 years now so I think you already have a great handle on how to help her!
Your so wonderful 😊
Have continued patience with her, as she is trying to understand herself in her journey. As you are there for her being super supportive, there is nothing else that you need to do for her. Let her take the steps that she needs to take at the time she is ready to take them. Like a baby taking their first steps, can’t rush them until they are ready.
Absolutely amazing partner!! My biggest piece of advice that you haven’t mentioned is just give her extra support and love when she’s feeling dysphoric to help her through that
Your gf is one lucky girl.
*Just keep doing what you’re doing :)
Compliments such as pretty, beautiful cute, and sweet was really gender affirming for me. Maybe she feels the same
Definitely sounds like you are a supportive partner. For me, some days are hard for different reasons related to being trans, so good to be there for her. I think also checking in regularly and asking if there’s anything you could help with would be nice.
You just said her more times than anyone I know has to me, I think you’re already doing it pretty well. Just keep at it you wonderful human x
help her find some clothes that fit!!! can be really scary finding clothes, people dont usually judge but sometimes they do and having someone you know nearby helps a lot
WOW. you do all of that? Gimme... lol
Easy. Do what youve been doing. Youre already more than perfectly doing the part you want to fullfill
unconventional suggestion: get her a surprise pint of ice cream. i love it when my boy suprises me with it 🥰
You are doing so much already. Most of us having a partner who is accepting and helpful! Each situation is different, so I don’t have any specific suggestions except to say keep loving her and supporting her. Love is hard to come by when you’re trans.
Well, you're doing amazing already but you *may* be able to help her with really identifying whether she's trans or not. I've some questions that I have used in the past for other trans people to kinda figure that out. I'll keep them in a way that can be used for transmascs as well for anyone who might need them <3

1) Do you like your penis/vagina and would you keep it if you had the option to switch or get rid of it? (Not about surgery n stuff, just the principle)

2) Are you ok with the way your chest looks? Do want (to get rid of your) boobs? Do you want (to get rid of) the body hair?

3) Would you want people to look at you and see a man or a woman or something inbetween?

If she answers any of these 3 with the answer that does not fit with the traditional way their AGAB looks and acts, she is probably not cis. I'm not gonna say ""oh yea she's trans of she says yes on any of these"" because there's people who say yes but aren't trans. These questions are just something to hand to them to ponder and should in most cases help with them realising they're either cis or not. 

Hope it helps and much love to both of you!
you are already doing amazing. Just call her pretty every once in a while, randomly. That alone does wonders for our confidence ☺️
As others have said it sounds like you’re doing amazing! One thing, which I don’t know will be relevant but comes from personal experience: she may take some time figuring out which things will be euphoric/dysphoric for her. Don’t make any assumption and be aware that things may change as she clarifies things and becomes more comfortable.

I was in a similar position as her, gf at the time was very supportive but also made some assumptions that ended up making me really uncomfortable (for example: grabbing my then-nonexistent boobs made me extremely dysphoric, not euphoric. Now I love it!).
Get her to have a read of this 
https://genderdysphoria.fyi
Oh man... That so cool... Love both you...
Well basicly this is how you can support someone. You are a perfect girlfriend❤️
I love when my bf paints my toe nails cause he's actually really good. Also if we are out in public and he notices someone staring at me he will reach out for my hand.  Sometimes It's the littlest things that have the biggest impact. Having a solid support system will make daily life better/easier.
Say ""your a beautiful girl and I'm lucky to have you"" then hug her and give her loves
Just continue to support and be there for her. What you’re doing is what you need to be doing.
Honestly your perfect already. Your the dream trans gf from what I read. Just keep it up 😊
I feel like this is the most you can ever do for a trans person. This is her journey, not yours. The only thing you can do i support her wholeheartedly. Op u r super cool
I think you’re already going above and beyond for her. You’re absolutely amazing for that.
You’re doing great so far! If it’s possible for her to talk to a gender therapist those can be a big help
As I don’t know if you are it sounds you already are in love but if she works from home trying to get her to live as a female for a month or 2 without being  male everything must be girl mode you are absolutely awesome for her and help her get started with a lgbt ⚧ group and help her get started understanding her fears her worries things we all have I’m so glad to see you a very supportive person and awesome friend hugs and kisses sweetie
I'm in the same position as your GF. And honestly this would be all I would ever ask for. You sound perfect
my ex girlfriend did the exact same thing for me when I started questioning and it was the BEST she could have done. we even had little code words for when we would be looking at femme clothes for me for if she'd think itd look good on me and fit my body type.
you're a queen. 👑

(her being my ex is completely unrelated to my gender journey)
I hope my bf is going to be like you, I literally don't think you could be more supportive
Hi there, you sound like a lovely couple, and she is very lucky to have you! It makes my heart melt a little 😊. May I ask how your gf got to try your clothes on your first date? I simply can't imagine how they got into that situation lol.. I guess it worked out amazing in the end. -Emily I guess
Like somebody else said: Encouragement.

Encouragement is reassurance that you want for them what they want for themselves.

In my relationship, when my girlfriend quits mentioning things related to me being trans, I feel like she is ready to “sweep it under the rug”, that she doesn’t want it to be reality, etc.

A few months ago she was sending me cute pics of all the outfits she put together for a rave we were going to. I sent her a picture of a basic ass guy in basic ass shorts and a tee shirt, 5 times, and said “welp I guess these are my 5 outfits.” — I just needed encouragement to do something a little more socially risky. (Something more feminine.) I could have done it easily with her confidently supporting me. (And… what is more encouraging to something you want to do when *somebody else* suggested it?)

Don’t let their “trans-ness” or whatever fade into history. (Like I said above.) I’ve experienced this happening, where it’s no longer acknowledged because I was too scared (felt like it’s all I ever talked about) to talk about it, and she just didn’t mention it, so it felt like it was over and basically felt like I had to re-introduce the idea. Almost like coming out *again*, which was difficult as hellllll.

""And some things that should not have been forgotten were lost. History became legend. Legend became myth. And for two and a half thousand years, the ~~Ring~~ **transgender feelings, struggles, and stuff that very badly needed to be acknowledged and shared** passed out of all knowledge.""

— Lady Galadriel, The Lord of the Rings: The Fellowship of the Ring
Nope not a dang thing.  Just keep on what yoir doing.
A little bit of jealousy can be healthy in a relationship. He's not controlling and find it more supportive then insecurity. But I can see your point of view. I don't have passing privilege and sometimes just  being in public can be extremely anxiety inducing. It's one of his ways he shows support and love.
😂 hope it’s helpful 😂
Oh yes! We've trying out female pronouns. Our language is very gendered (all adjectives have gender) so it was a big change. It seems to be really helpful though! She really likes it :)
Oh yes! Thank you!!
She has a nickname that's pretty androgynous so we've been going with that, but when she mentioned transitioning she did mention other names, so I think I'll ask her if she wants to try them out :)
Oh I'm sorry. Do you have supportive friends or family though? I hope you have/find a safe space and people that allow you to be comfortable being yourself. Everyone deserves that
Oh I actually have a question about that! 
When I feel bad about some aspect of my body, she usually assures me that it's great and she loves it. For example, if I say I don't like my belly shell hold it and kiss it and be all cute. And at first I didn't like it but in the long run it did help.
Now, when she's feeling dysphoric about her shoulders or belly I've tried to do the same, but she doesn't seem to like it.
And I don't know if it's like me, and if I keep doing it it will eventually help, or if it's fundamentally different because it's trans-related dysphoria. If someone has some insight or experiences I would really like to hear them
Oh yes thank you! Our language is really gendered (all adjectives have a gender) and we've been using female pronouns but I sometimes forget to use more feminine adjectives, like pretty instead of handsome. I will try it out! Thank you!
Thank you so much!
Oh yes! Something like that happened when I encouraged her to use a dress and then she said it made her feel bad cause it was too cutesy and girlish and made her feel like she was trying too hard. I will pay more attention to stuff like this!! Thank you!
Will check it out! Thank you!
Isn’t that being insecure and jealous?
We had been talking for a while and wanted to meet, but this was during covid so we couldn't go out. We decided to hang at her house, but it was pretty scary to not have a plan (we didn't know each other that well, and we'd basically only talked online up until that point cause we were living in different cities). So we were trying to decide on stuff we wanted to do. She was always very open about how she thought girl clothes were better than male ones, so I offered to take some of my clothes with me and she could try them out. It was pretty chill actually. She thought she was a femboy, I thought she looked cute, one week later we were dating (yes a little rushed but shhh) and now we're here :)
Oh thank you so much, it didn't even occured to me that this might happen. I think there were some days were I might have been kinda dismissive because stress and uni and stuff like that. The way you explained it, like coming out again, was really helpful. Thank you!!
I'm so glad she's enjoying the change!
It’s different. Good attempt, but won’t really help. I’m not sure what it’s like for her, but for me personally, when people treat my dysphoria like most body image issues, it just makes it worse. Instead, when she’s feeling dysphoric, you can try something like, “I’m sorry you’re dealing with that. How can I help?” That way, you’ll know exactly what she needs/wants from you in order to help her through that.
Damn, this is just sounding more and more like my situation. Last night I was having a dysphoric ""episode"" (for lack of a better word) and they started complementing some of my really fem features (my thighs and hips) and stuff like that. They made me feel like a woman.

Sometimes it helps, like with my chest, they will often hold me as if I had boobs, and that really helps. But with bottom dysphoria, it kinda helped that they didn't touch it, but more so the area around it and pretended it wasn't there. (Again, thighs and hips)

Best thing you can do is ask her.
While these questions are a starting point, I'd be very wary of using the first one to ""gauge"" whether someone is trans - not every trans person dislikes or wants to change their genitals. (I don't.) Personally this question makes me cringe because it's phrased in such a ""gotcha"" way, and often used by transmedicalists to invalidate other trans people. You're doing great and it could introduce unnecessary tension to suddenly start ""interrogating"". If she does want any surgeries in the future she will tell you.

I guess the Rock should stay out of Florida or they might take his daughter away.		"I hate all this ant trans and anti drag shit going on.

But for the post above, unfortunately there is a difference that folks again drag etc. will jump at. This big one I see is ""The rock is playing dress up at the request of his daughter. The children are being made to go see someone in drag."" And that's without doing a straw man argument for what they see drag to be.

Just saying, be certain to have a response ready when someone has a counter to your point.
Rock's cosplaying Harley, of course he's dressed skimpy.
Do they even know that it's been normal for years to let your daughter do your makeup, even if you don't want it. Like the only reason they're mad is because of a hatred to people who just want to express themselves.
What’s going on here in Florida? I don’t keep up with political stuff. Mostly because I don’t understand any of it.
[removed]
I don’t even know what to make of this tbh…
If at some point your child comes up to you asking to spend time with her and you refuse so that you can uphold gender standards, then you're a bad parent.

Enjoy time with your child. Bond with them. Otherwise, when the time comes when they get to choose what your relationship looks like, you won't enjoy the result.

Conservative parents get so butthurt over this stuff.
Yep. The Rock is officially banned from Florida,  Texas and Tennessee...

One day, these idiots are gonna realise all they're doing is alienating everyone but the mouth-breathing meatheads who cheer for hate...
This is extremely exaggerated, this isnt a ""no man in makeup bill in Florida, or a permanent ban on drag it's a bill that stops adults from taking children to these shows. Quit fearmongering people! Tell the truth! I'm so sick of people manipulating the truth, if  you want to live in the land of delusions, then do it by yourself! Don't become a mindless pawn. This is a cis problem labeled as a trans problem to manipulate you into caring & fighting for their cause.

Yeah but here's the deal, the people that are going to challenge the meme are not going to be persuaded by logic or reason. Their entire ideology is based in the emotions of insecurity, they do not have any interest in a discussion. The strategy is to disrupt and delegitimize our fight for our existence. The new rule is block the trolls, don't feed them.
I mean, yes?  But also, if the rock said something trans supportive tomorrow, they’d totally take his daughter.  Because the meaning of drag is subjective, the enforcement will be arbitrary.  Which… is the point.  They don’t care about drag.  They want an excuse to arrest people they don’t like.
alt right media is literally demonizing drag people, most of the people that fall for their propaganda have never met or seen a drag queen, or a trans person, and i've seen some people say that the reason some right wing idiots view trans people as ""sexual deviants"" is because the only interaction they had with trans folk was through pornography and propaganda.
He's been dressing skimpy on national tv for years
Oh, shit 😳 🤦🏼‍♀️ girl... I want to hug you and slap you at the same time. I'm so sorry you have to deal with this. What's happening is a bunch of anti-trans laws that are going to make life extremely difficult for trans people.
Upon reading this article you sent, I don’t think you understand what it says. Yes, the bill was written to appeal to the “protect the children” crowd. The issue with it is that it is an imaginary issue conjured up to restrict the rights of trans people. It’s simply a dog whistle.
Nobody is taking kids to any kind of show involving nudity or lewd behavior. This is the same ridiculous nonsense as the satanic panic. Yeah dungeons and dragons are making kids satanists and drag shows are grooming them to be gay. Give me a break 🙄 
You do realize that the regular laws that we already have, prohibit minors from entering any establishment with nudity. Under 18 no admittance is what you see on all these places and those are just the ones that don't serve alcohol those ones require patrons to be 21 years of age. Further more, who takes their kids to shows involving nudity and or lewd behavior? Given they could even get in the door since that's already illegal for both parents and business owners. So if these basic laws already existing would lead to arrests if this was happening we would be seeing record arrest rates. Where are all the drag queens in court? Where's the news on all the bar owners who woke up and decided they wanted to no longer have a bar and lose their liquor license so they could insure that some children get to see some semi nude drag queens rather than the magazines they find under dad's bed or more realistic the free porn all over the internet. Oh but can't fuck with the porn industry because that's capitalism 👎
Just discussing opinions on the best ways to go about trans public relations.
>it's a bill that stops adults from taking children to these shows.

Yeah but why? Why even create such a bill when it's completely unnecessary. Anybody who takes a child to an establishment where there's nudity is going to be arrested for child endangerment, any establishment that allows a person under 18 to enter when there is nudity is also held accountable for child endangerment and they lose their business license. This is already the preexisting law everywhere. 
There is absolutely no ( real) reason for any of these drag laws.

Seeing wrestlers with clothes on is just weird.
Like what
Drag queens are mostly not trans. That's the thing silly this has nothing to do with trans people. Drag queens are the opposite of us. We actually take our feminine form as a 24/7 job. They temporarily do it for fun, performances, self entertainment or fulfillment. Just because we look similar & wear girl clothes doesn't mean shit. That's like saying moths & butterflies are the same. We are not responsible for their actions & I will not associate myself with the gross individuals targeting kids. You can, but I'll have no part in it.
I meant the person in the post
>Yeah but why? Why even create such a bill when it's completely unnecessary

Yeah it is necessary when adults are being extremely sexual in front of children, and the parents are enabling it. 
[Bet you still try to deny it](https://mobile.twitter.com/libsoftiktok/status/1631313549204094982/mediaViewer?currentTweet=1631313549204094982&currentTweetUser=libsoftiktok)

> who takes a child to an establishment where there's nudity is going to be arrested for child endangerment,

Sure but a show doesn't have to have nudity to be inappropriate for children
People are not rational, they make decisions from the amygdala and then they go back and do the mental gymnastics to justify and rationalize their decision. 
No amount of science is going to work in convincing people. The people on the fence need to ""feel"" that trans people are just regular people like they are. The goal should be creating that feeling throughout the greater society. 
When you think about Pepsi you get a feeling, a feeling that reminds you of backyard BBQ, the fourth of July, Pepsi is an old family friend who's been there since your first taste of soda pop. If Pepsi ran for president she would get elected but coke would give her a run for her money.
Here's something https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/254
The idea that drag queens target kids is greatly exaggerated, but even so, the wording is ambiguous enough that it may as well apply to us. Do you think that they know the distinction between trans and drag? Do you think that they care to know? Also, drag queens have been historically great advocates for the LGBTQ community. Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.
>Yeah it is necessary when adults are being extremely sexual in front of children. Bet you still try to deny it

So by your standards that's inappropriate? 
I think this here is a better example of what's inappropriate https://m.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=pfbid0pkTutZENyK4A21CSJTkJhXtnKckw7q7BAnrcdzKB8k7jWQ44GWbmTRzg9ad89P8dl&id=742889936&sfnsn=mo&mibextid=6aamW6

Or how about this....
https://ifunny.co/picture/agree-with-this-but-also-i-love-hooters-if-kids-xuJOIuac9

No what this all boils down to is that the concept of someone being a different gender than their biological sex bothers you. That's what you're having a problem with. Why can't you just cut the crap and be honest here? 
You don't really care about lewd behavior, nudity, or probably anything else you're so worried other people's children ""might"" be exposed to when guaranteed their peers and television expose them to way worse. 
This is about you having an opinion on how everyone else in society should view biological sex and gender. 
You want everyone to be like you. When they aren't you try to force it any way you can. That's what this is all about in real life, isn't it?
[deleted]
Coke was first, so yeah.
So it’s saying that sex reassignment surgeries for kids are considered physical harm? And I don’t understand the last part.
>The idea that drag queens target kids is greatly exaggerated

So you're admitting that it's happening. Cool

>Do you think that they know the distinction between trans and drag?

Dosn't matter, just because a clueless child calls a moth a butterfly doesn't mean it is & that I should go with it, & I won't.

> queens have been historically great advocates for the LGBTQ community

So? They still are not trans & some are not even LGBTQ+. Also we shouldn't constantly align ourselves with who supports the community vs. what's actually the morally correct thing to do. 

>Injustice anywhere is injustice everywhere.

Then go after the pedos targeting kids? Pick your battles better. Hmm, protect children or men in make up & wigs doing performances 🤔 hmm protect children from sexualize content or let grown men shake ass, in front of children 🤔  your not even a percent as righteous as you think you are.
These same ""most people"" voted Wet Ass Pussy into Casey Caseum's  top 10 🤷🏼‍♀️ It's like Tommy Lee Jones says to Will Smith in Men in Black... ""The person, is intelligent and rational, the people, are not.""
Things become accepted as they pass what's known as the Overton Window. The information you have been exposed to, the evidence that eventually changed your mind, in what way was it presented? Did you get a sudden hair and decide you wanted to hit the library and research a bunch of obscure medical textbooks? 
If you did then you are a one in a billion and major props, but if not, it's no big deal, because most people don't. For most people, what changes their minds is that they are exposed to evidence that is made palatable, information wrapped in story and narrative to which the observer can relate and identify even if only in a fictional context. Because when it's over, even though it was just a movie, Boys Don't Cry, created feelings inside the people who watched it. 
Bottom line, nobody changes minds they change hearts and the minds follow.
Yeah it had more kick back then 🤣
That bill does not mention the word ""surgeries"".  Kids don't get sex reassignment surgeries anyway, that is not a thing that happens, so there is no need for a law against it.  The wording of the bill is, however, broad enough that it could be interpreted to cover any gender affirming support for trans kids, as they could then be judged as being ""at risk"".

As written it's entirely possible (and most likely the original intention) that it would result in kids being taken away from their parents by the state if those parents do something as simple as refer to their kid with a different name and pronouns, or allow them to dress in clothes that don't conform to their assigned gender.
I say “greatly exaggerated” as in I’ve only ever heard of one case of it happening, which I believe is objectively wrong, but doesn’t represent the majority of cases. Just like how I believe child molestation from clergymen is objectively wrong, that doesn’t mean I believe that children should be barred from church.
[deleted]
Are you fucking kidding me. Taken away from their parents for wearing girl clothes wtf.
I have no doubt in my mind that your default was exactly as you say. Do you think it might at all be possible that you might want to give people the benefit of a doubt because you are a decent person and that's what decent people do? Could it be possible that humans have a natural tendency to project their values onto others? 
Maybe you live in Canada where most people are decent and have a live and let live mentality. Certainly not the only demographic region that exists Germany in 1942 very different demographic to market to. Entirely different way of viewing humanity and existence. The entire united states didn't even give women the right to vote until Aug 18 1920 when it was ratified. Segregation didn't end until July 2 1964. 

Don't assume that most people are as smart as you or as moral and ethical as you. If everyone was so smart and ethical the world would most certainly not be in it's current state would it?"	11lvplt	trans	754	0.99	2023-03-08 12:57:14
A brief reminder for the mtf crowd...	"We are girls when we're not wearing makeup.
We are girls when we're not wearing clothes.
We are girls when we're wearing ""boy clothes.""
We are girls when we haven't shaved.
We are girls when our voices are deep.
We are girls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We are girls.  We are loved.  We are valid."	"Yay! Hugs and pancakes for all!
I really don’t feel like it tho
😍😍💪💪
I feel this way all the time although I feel a lot more fem when I am shaved and in girl clothing, nevertheless I am a girl❤️
Realizing that I didn't just want to wear girl clothes, but *be* a girl all the time no matter what I was doing or wearing helped me realize I am trans :)
Yes the heck we are <3
🥰
You know, I really needed to hear this today. Thank you.
💖💪
This is so encouraging! 💜
YES YOU ARE
Yes. I choose not to wear makeup since I’m not ready for it yet and I still have some decent acne. You have no idea how many times I get misgendered even when I’m wearing full girls clothes and a bra all because people don’t see my face as wearing makeup so they immediately assume I’m a boy because I don’t wear it.
Thank you, I’m still in the closet as a trans woman and it’s so hard when everyone sees you as a man. Today I took the practice sats and it hurt to have to fill in male as my gender.
Preach it! 👏✌️❤️
Love 💓🦋
Thank you.  I really needed to hear this today. <3
Your all women through and through. If people can't see that. Then they are the problem.
True but goddamn I haven’t been able to shave in a week because my mom keeps forgetting to buy shaving cream I swear she does it on purpose sometimes
thank you, i think i needed to hear (see?) this
Wow I really needed this.. thank you so so much! 💜
Thank you so much! I needed to hear this because dysphorias been kicking my ass every second I’m awake
I like to act that way but it's hard when nobody else see's it that way.
At what age do you change from a girl to a woman?
<3
Sincerely I thank you for this, in this moment it couldn't have been more perfect!
I really needed this today ❤️
i need to get round to addressing my brain for misgendering myself. it’s so fucking annoying but honestly i just don’t see myself as a girl when i’m not wearing a skirt or anything feminine
If a cis girl can wear ,,boy clothes,, while still being seen as female than so can you!dont let anyone ruin cool clothes you like wearing.If you know you are female then thats all that matters, your clothes and the opinions of strangers don't devine your gender.Stay positive Queen!
Thanks for the very awesome reminder from a very awesome person. <3
I really struggle with saying I'm a girl. I tell people they can call me a boy or guy or whatever cause I just dont know if I want to fight that battle. Am I really a girl? Most tell me no way cause I dont have a uterus nor can I birth a child. So wtf? How do I deal with this when even in the trans community, there are no consistent facts or theories. It's all scattered. I feel so lost.
Needed to see this 😊❤
Yes thank you!
Sometimes it doesn't feel like that but I just know that I'm a girl on the inside and I want to be a girl on the outside too
this made me cry!!! i've been triying to be myself for a time now, but sometimes the dysphoria is just so strong I don't know why i had to be born with such masculine features.
i needed to hear this thank you
Thank you for this post
Kind of wish my wife would read this
I prefer women but agreed
Then why do I constantly feel like Im a boy despite knowing this
Hell yes we are. As a teenager and my erection untucked and people noticed and were jerks, my fiancé (BF at the time), would remind me I am beautiful and sexy. I was fortunate that my voice never really went deep and I had major issues with makeup, took me years to learn how to do it properly. Pennywise had nothing on me 8)~ 

Love yourself ladies and love will come to you!
Only if helltaker made the pancakes
Yummy pancakes are incredible.  With proper Canadian maple syrup and real butter... crap I’m hungry now. I must make a stack.
It’s hard to all the time, focus on the times you do / feel most comfortable
Same! If I have to go to school, I’m not out there, I immediately feel less like a girl because I can’t behave like one there.
You can use conditioner. I’ve used it for decades to shave.
I mean, I'm 42 so...  

Growing old is a requirement.
Growing up is optional.
I'll let you know when I take off the cat ears.
I just take one day at a time. Babysteps
Is your wife trans?
Habit.  Learned behavior.  Give it time.
*cocks shotgun* I'm just fine with the normal pancakes.
i sorta have it the same way, tho my work is not really somewhere I can dress like a girl for more than one reason but yeah even just going out to buy groceries, it sucks
I have really really sensitive skin and I need the numbing stuff (pretty sure it’s lidocaine) or my legs feel like their on fire, thx for the tip tho I might just suck it up at this rate
No but she should understand this about me
*raises hand* I'll make the pancakes.

My shell finally cracked	"Yesterday I just realized I was trans (mtf) and the realization un-numbed me. 

My mom and I have a tendency to go numb and in denial when we’re going through pain and yesterday made me see that I’ve been numb since I was 3. 

When I was 3 I would always play as the girl characters until my dad caught me once and gave me a stern talking to and refused to let me play again until I picked one of the male characters. 

When I was 4 I learn that girls sit down to pee so I got into the habit of sitting down because it just felt right until my mom walked in on me (I only got privacy when I turned 7) and told me to stand. 

Later that same year I tried using my mom’s lipstick and she caught me and ‘beat this demon out of me’ (I’m in an African religious family) and then I just stopped. Stopped playing, stopped exploring, stopped many things.

Until this April when I snapped and just started questioning everything: my religion, my relationships, my sexual orientation. Things I had been previously told to never question because questioning those ‘leads people to Hell’, and when I got to my gender I approached with caution and started exploring what it meant to be a man, what it meant to be a woman and that’s when I realized that I was a girl.

When I looked into the future I saw myself as a girl with bangs and a feminine voice, a slight bust and wearing the feminine clothes I always wanted to, where I was happier. 

This realization has given me confidence in who I am as a person and, for once, made me excited for the future. 

Sorry if this was too long"	"Welcome to the sisterhood! As an elder trans woman, I'm so so proud of you, sweetheart! You've got this ❤️ Have you settled on a name?

Congrats, I had a similar run. Started in July 2020 when I kinda broke down and started trying to figure out why my life felt like crap even though it was objectively great. Was sure I was very trans by October. By New Years 2021, I was certain that I was going to fully transition. It's shocking how much has improved with changing such a simple assumption. Just about everything in my life is now better. I hope it goes even better for you.

Do you live in a city where you can find trans community? Or within reasonable driving distance? Having other trans people in your life will help a LOT.
> When I was 4 I learn that girls sit down to pee so I got into the habit of sitting down because it just felt right until my mom walked in on me (I only got privacy when I turned 7) and told me to stand. 

Wait what?

Sorry to focus on this part specifically but it's just so weird to me. Policy at my home was that everyone sits down to pee because doing it standing without a proper urinal just makes a giant mess. 

I know that not all households had that policy as strictly enforced as ours, but it's still generally considered that if you wanna be polite you generally sit down so you don't make a mess.

Having an enforced standing policy is just so fucking weird to me.
Proud of you, OP.

The road ahead is long and arduous, but it is the single most rewarding journey of our lives. I'm sorry that your family have insisted on trying to box you in instead of letting you flourish, but you have family that will love you regardless. 💜💛💜💛💜💛

Congratulations, Theo! And welcome!! <3

My first question is, are you safe right now? If so, good!!! If not, what are the next steps you need to take to ensure your safety? If they would beat you as a small child, what will they do to you now? The answers frighten me. You don't say how old you are but I hope you're an adult and on your own and safe from them. If you're not out of there, please begin plotting your escape immediately. Figure out where you need to go and how to get there. Save every penny that you can to fund your exodus. Protect yourself, and if it's going to take you some time to escape then carve out a space to honor and acknowledge yourself in, even if it's only an hour once a week while everyone is at church or something. Do not lose track of who you are, and good luck to you in climbing out of the closet. Once you know you're trans, everything makes more sense and it's hard to go back in and stifle yourself. <3 <3 <3
Congratulations! I can’t relate to all of this. I think the feelings started when I was 11 or 12 but being autistic has taught me to suppress and mask so much of myself. But I definitely remember playing as female characters in games and forcing myself to learn to play male chars in smash as well so I wasn’t seen as that creepy dude playing women so they could see their ass and tits move around on screen. But then I played a female char in D&D for the first time and the floodgates just opened. I spent like 9 hours after the session figuring out her backstory and wardrobe and couldn’t really deny it anymore.
Congrats!

I'm only 36 but I call myself a trans elder in slight jest sometimes  - but it's not cause of my age, but how long I've been out and living my trans-ass life (nearing 20 years). Most of my peers are more like 1yr-7yrs post egg crack, lol.
I consider myself an elder trans woman because I've been out for over eight years, not because I'm 31.
Eight weeks in. I know there are changes. We had a locum chef at work who hasn't spoken to me for over six months - working elsewhere - and he said to me you look different, and ""better, somehow"".

He didn't know my new reality so I told him.
Aww, thank you
Okay you get the elder status does that mean you give you speeches at the annual trans meet up in the woods that conservatives convinced me have ?

Wife bought made me die laughing	Long story short my inlaws are homophobic bigots. My son was on a facetime call with his Grandma (My MiL) when my wife walked by so was forced to talk to her mother. My lovely mother in law then somehow asked how my wife really feels about me crossdressing (Been living fulltime 2 months now and on HRT). My wife without skipping a beat just replies when she is crossdressing I assume its laundry day and she only has old clothes left to wear.	"I regret I can only upvote this once :)
WOWZA, yeah that's the way, impressive LOL!! 🥰💃🥰
Let's 👏 fucking 👏 go 😤
Props to your wife :p
Yikes... fuckin stone cold killah! Love it! 💘

I want to cry this is so beautiful!
Maybe its just me... but the people in your life are 'sad' or 'upset' by you being happy and living your life... they don't deserve to be in your life.
Had your back.
I’m in the same situation and have been for years.  I lived full time for 4 years but my wife and kids (in their 30’s) were soooo sad.  I am happy with the knowledge that I’m trans but project  myself as male. But I know the truth and that is what is important to me.  life is not fair but I’ll make the best of it.
Omg! I am so sorry. You are so strong and selfless to do so."	lvirvv	trans	711	0.99	2021-03-01 19:54:54
Had a rough week but got some new clothes - need some confidence, how do I look? And could you call me Sophie?		"Sophie my dear you look fabulous

Sorry you had a tough week Sophie!  That’s a cute outfit.
You're beautiful Sophie
Sophie.  You look awesome. Great outfit.
Sophie( what a beautiful name!) you look positively adorable!
You are amazing Sophie!
Sophie, you look like a maiden that could easily knock any perverse man out with one punch. Your hair is fantastic! I'd suggest maybe adding a flower hair clip or something like that to extenuate your lovely locks of hot chocolate brown. If you are not well versed in makeup, may I suggest using just a dab of mascara to make your eyes shine more brightly than they do already? I would love to see you wearing a little bit of makeup. You still look absolutely beautiful!
[removed]
I wanna hold your hand, and take you out to dinner, Soph.
Aww, thanks :)
haha I love the energy!
Thanks a lot for your positivity, its sometimes very hard to tell yourself everything will be better so thanks for doing that for me :)
thank youu
thaanks :D

Edit: and thanks for the Ally Award, that's very kind of you! :D
Yayy, so cool to meet another transfem called Sophie (or Sophia) :D
Haha thank you :D I don't even know if it's supposed to be a shirt or a dress or maybe both, I just love it (got it in a mint-color too) :D
Thank you, that's lovely to hear!
thank you! (:
thanx (:
Heey (: Thank you and I love your looks and your energy btw :D leggings are amazing (kidnapped some from my roommate with her consent :D)
Thank you!
It's getting better...My mom was pretty shitty and transphobic a while back when I came out and now acted as if nothing happened, which kinda put me in a depressive mood and I've kinda let myself go over the week, didn't shave which made me feel like shit and not really making an effort on how I looked, but went shopping with a friend today and finally kinda saw myself again in the mirror, so it's slowly getting better... thank you for asking :)  


Edit: readability
Awww, thank you and thanks for the Hugs Award :D
Aww, thanks :D
tysm :D I love being considered fab
Awww, thank you!
Thank you so much, I love painting my nails so much!
Haha thank you for the compliment (:
Aww, thanks :D
Haha thanks for the sweet comment (:
Awww, thank you, that was really great to hear :D
Thanks for the sweet compliments!   
I didn't have the energy to put on makeup but a bit of Eyeliner and Mascara is my routine! :D  
And the flower hairclip is an amazing idea, I will def try that!
yeahh... not easy but thank you for the sentiment (:
yesss
Of course!
Mhm it sure is :) 
Chose it because I've loved the name since I've been little. For some reason I just liked it lol
Thats the least I could do! 😁
Samee it's so much fun!
No problem! As a trans person, I find it very helpful to be told that you are valid
Samee I didn't even think about it long, picking out a second name is way harder
Yes! Sometimes you just can't tell that to yourself, so someone else has to!"	pzasku	trans	696	0.99	2021-10-01 15:49:56
What Are Your Plans For Next Year?	"Hello fellow trans people of Reddit. Now that the year is ending, and its the time to start thinking about plans for next year and resolutions to go along with them, what plans/resolutions might you have for the year of 2022?

I for one wanna get comfortable enough to go out in public wearing feminine clothes. Also coming out to some really close friends of mine.

Edit: Happy New Years everyone, and I had fun reading through every single one of your comments, hope I didn’t miss any and I hope all of you enjoy your 2022!!"	"Planning to make an appointment to finally start hrt
Get an old scar removed, lose some weight, get a gender removed and a new one installed, you know; the usual.
I just need to get blood work re-done to confirm a couple things with my Endo, and then I can start HRT! I already have the supportive partner but I do worry about conservative family members
Getting HRT started.
Social Transition and Blockers
Continue with HRT, maybe booking FFS for 2023, stay in boymode because college, but if everything is fine, this could be my last New Year’s Day as a “man”.
Survive basically
The next year is gonna be very loaded for me : 
I will : 

Get my emancipation in January or February and change my name and gender on my documents ( ID card, passport etc… ) 

Start appointments with a psychiatrist to obtain  his approval for HRT ( estrogens ) from January 

See a special doctor ( I don’t have the name in English I only have it in French sorry ) to do physical and blood test to know if it is ok to take estrogens in June 

In the end of June, I’m gonna move from southwest to northeast of France And get as far as possible from my family ( incredibly transphobic ) 
 
And something more “easy”, I’m gonna be upgraded from regional to national team at chess, and change my chess license name to Isha [familyname]. 


So yeah a long year but I’m so happy about it !
Not attempt suicide and sort my life out. Hopefully finally come out to my parents as trans.
Not coming out
Start laser hair removal, build a wardrobe and makeup skills. Maybe even start HRT
Begin my journey and I am so happy like never in the last few years
Keep on keeping on. 

Tomorrow is my 100th day on HRT so I'm looking forward to adding to that number and seeing the changes. 

I'm going to make a real effort to learn makeup. I took the first step this week and got color matched at Ulta. I had a really nice clerk help me get some basics and recommend some additional stuff to buy next. 

I want to figure out how to change my name. I'm tired of having to use my given name on bills and insurance.
Hopefully top surgery
i just want to know who i am so i can figure out where to go from here. been so lost and confused for so long.
Buying makeup a skirt and talking with my parents without crying for the whole week🥲(not cus they are unsoportive im just bad at talking)
Continue my journey of self love that I’ve found since coming out. Along with spreading the love I’ve found to others and overall live my best true authentic life!
For me I have to except myself this next year. I have always struggled with my identity and not felling ready to be myself in front of others, like having the courage to start wearing feminine cloths. I have friends who have figured out that I am bi and who think that I'm thinking of starting transition but I(having come from a very closed off and stuck in it's way community where only female people can do that stuff because the there still female and that's all this male dominated community cares about) need to start treating myself right. I have always had to suppress anything out of the ordinary about myself and that is going to change this year. I'm going to except myself and everyone else is going to have to except that, all be it a bit difficult as I am a kind of well known person at my school(and that school being a **very** redneck school). I'm going to tell my friends that I know will support me and help me. I will finally be myself after too many years of suppressing who I am and what/who I like, I am going to finally be **me**.

^(sorry for the rant I needed to get all that off my chest)
my friend bought me a binder, so i’ll be going out with a flatter chest + im going to hopefully learn to save money so i can buy my own masc clothing😋🤝
Ive been on the waitlist for hrt for years now hopefully this year will be the one
I'm getting my genital operation next year! I'm excited!
Start presenting female after I graduate from my Christian highschool
Mines to try and get out in public more, and to be more accepting of myself
6 month checkup next Wed so I'm going to *attempt* to start the year by switching from sublingual to injections (😬) and adding Progesterone.

Other ""plans"" include getting name and gender marker changed, attempt to weight cycle so I can try to lose this belly *and* get curves (please god), see if I can get the *official* gender dysphoria diagnosis (goddamn Texas not letting LPC diagnose), and figure out tattoo to cover up some of the spots I dont like
My goals for 2022 are to finally be comfortable enough to go out in public as me and I also want to celebrate my birthday later in the year as me (not necessarily in public), but have my friends (some of whom I’m not out to yet) help me celebrate my birthday whilst I’m all dolled up.
World domination
Figuring out what my gender means to me. Also watching Queer Eye
This year I'm going to work on getting my name legally changed, and actually get serious about vocal training. 

Oh, and I'd REALLY like meet another nice trans woman and suck some girldick.
Start hrt and get a good skincare routine
To learn more about my identity
Have my first bottom surgery. It’s scheduled, but that wait is something else. Would like to get laser hair removal. Tackling depression is a big goal for next year.
Based. I'm starting my HRT hopefully in the next 6 months, as I was recently referred to a gender clinic
come out and (hopefully) socially transition (name change n shit) and maybe hrt? haven't decidee if i want that yet
I’m hoping to come out to my sister and friends, as well as get started with a trans friendly therapist who can help me get approved for T covered by my insurance!
HRT appointments set for early January, getting some vocal training going and being out at least socially all the way are my goals for next year.
[deleted]
I can barely think into next week, but..
I'd like to try to get more comfortable with wearing pink and cute stuff again. Truscum rotted my brain a long time ago and gave me super bad imposter syndrome. I want to be able to feel cute and still feel like a ""real"" boy. 

I wanna try and seriously take steps towards getting top surgery. My partner has been incredibly supportive and he wants to help me as much as possible, but ultimately, I'm the one that has to schedule consultations and stuff. It's scary, but for my own mental health, I think it needs to happen.
Plans to start T and move onto the next phase of my life. Also get my family to call me by the correct name and pronouns.
Hopefully start HRT, but I dunno, I need money I haven't got at the moment so it feels far off. 😅
What I want to achieve this year is to wear my school's girls uniform to school. I am going to my GP soon to get referred to a psychologist so I can finally live as my true self. :D
Hopefully start socially transitioning finally since my social anxiety is getting in the way of that, get therapist hopefully and I hope I can start either guitar or drums whichever where I'm living allows lol
I have an HRT appointment on the 11th, I'm gonna work towards changing my name, and I'm gonna buy a bunch of cute clothes.
I just want to feel some semblance of stability again these past few months have been very hard on me financially and these past few weeks have been very hard emotionally
Hopefully get onto better medication as cyproterone has been brutal and definitely socially transition and change my name.
I should hopefully be getting my name legally changed before the school year ends, I’m looking forward to that the most!!
binder and haircut!!
Planning on making an HRT appointment soon, but the online system is broken, so I need to call someone, and that's terrifying.
My only real plan for 2022 is doing a legal name change. (And hopefully getting hrt)
Start my HRT.
Well I just found out I got covid...so id like to get better and also graduate high-school
I'm going to get my driver's license and hopefully get top surgery this year! I already have a consult date in July, I'm hoping that the surgery date isn't too long after that. And my mom is going to help me legally change my name for my birthday! :)
Hope I survive Covid, it’s been kicking my ass for a week now. I just really want to start HRT next month so I can truly be whom I really am before I die. I’m a girl and I just want to look like one so bad it hurts. I cry inside all the time. 

Jut want to say sorry for adding a bit of a dour mood to this thread. I love you all
Starting with starting hrt. Been going out in girl mode with friends recently and have never been happier. Just want to keep the progress going.
Well, I'll officially be an adult around mid-year, so I should be able to get HRT since I won't need permission from my dad. There's also a few informed consent clinics in my city, so it shouldn't be that big of a hassle. I'll be able to change my name, too. Been travelling for the holidays and I've hated hearing my deadname in security checks and such
come put to my parents, can't start t without them
Finding a new job that will allow me to live and sustain myself comfortably, find a decent apartment or house for rent, and hopefully get electrolysis out of the way since I'm still early in transition.
I'm planning to continue to question my gender and hopefully finally figure out what I am.
I'm in the closet till I graduate college in May of 23. So my plan is keep getting my finances in order and sorta just survive. 

&#x200B;

Also I want to figure out my preferred style some more, I know that I like gothy and pastel stuff, but I want to figure out what I like beyond that. I also want to lose weight, I am decently overweight atm, and have been hitting the gym the last few days and feeling really really good.
hire a lawyer to change my name
I'll start my PhD career and move to the US hopefully to escape this hellhole of a country. Yes, I can see the irony in that.
My wife and I are having a baby girl!!!!!!!! I'm SO excited

And I should be starting HRT in February or March

2022 is gonna rock ♥️💕
my resolution is to not be afraid to be myself and be out and proud ☺️🏳️‍⚧️
Getting rid of my uterus and maybe top surgery
Changing the gender marker on my driver's license 
Maybe start the legal name change process 

Being a better advocate for myself in regards of people using my name and pronouns.
Hide another year
I also want to start coming out to people in my life. I have a gathering with close friends on new years day and I think I'm just done hiding who I am from them.

We'll see how it goes (or doesn't go 😅)
I'm mainly just looking forward to my 1 year anniversary with my partner. It'll be on may 7th
Celebrating one year HRT in March. Def gonna get my name and gender marker changed. I'm finally going to get a real haircut once my hair grows out long enough.
Well It was to finally make an appointment with the trans friendly pcp that my wife sees but I  ended up with a really bad UTI so I had to go see her like three days ago because my wife made me. Best decision ever! Now I actually have a pcp that I know won’t discriminate against me so I want to take 2022 to start tackling some of my health problems and number one on my list is getting her to help with my sleeping problems!!!!

Edit: It’s New Years and I can’t type.
Starting HRT on the 12th. Moving out of my Ex's place. Coming out to my parents. And hopefully get a book published.
I'm going to come out at work now that it's becoming harder to be 100% boy mode
try to get approved for estrogen
Come out to family and hopefully start transitioning
Top surgery at the end of February. I'm hoping to get in with my doctor soon to up my T. 
End of 2022 hopes - beard
personally I vow to not take any misgendering and won’t allow people to ignore my name/prns anymore :)
In may I’m gonna start getting in better shape, so I can eventually do a spider man cosplay without being insecure :)
Get an orchi, I already have 2/3 letters I need
Get my letters ready for my vaginoplasty consultation in late February.
HRT on January 6th and ears pierced sometime that week.
Hopefully start not hating myself so much
Hopefully I'll go to my cousin's wedding in a nice dress :))
The last month of 21' was me recovering from a total breakdown, now with an official anxiety disorder diagnosis and some cool pills that basically made it all go away within the last 3 weeks.

In that time I found a huge part of it was feeling trapped in between 2 ends of the gender spectrum when I've really just wanted to be a girl my whole life.

So after 2 girls nights with a really supportive friend (who is miraculously the same size as me) 

I spent NYE shopping online based on the styles, sizes and cuts my friend helped me try on. 

She also donated her $700 Phillips IPL system so that's exciting (and terrifying... This thing looks so dangerous, I'll definately be asking for help with this soon) 

So my plan is to show up to my next psych appointment in a couple weeks as (female name) and see where that leads lol.
I hope I can start work at the post office so I can work towards being eligible for health benefits to begin HRT. One day at a time.
Sadly I don’t really have any plans😔 wanted to try and start finasteride even though my parents don’t want me too… but it’s unlikely I can get it by myself
Try to push through and not lose myself.
Head to college where I can identify how I please and prepare to start hrt
in 2022 i plan on transitioning bc i accidentally just came out via meme :DDD
Finally get this stupid cyst drained from my wrist. I've been dealing with this shit since June and it's been hurting me so much.

And, you know, losing weight and stuff.
Wear *good clothes* around more if my family
ride my bike, go to uni, try not to commit die, play runescape, repeat
Finish updating places on my name change, get a date for top surgery scheduled, lose weight, grow with my son
My 16th birthday is in 2022, I wanna come out to my sister
I turn 18 in late 2022. I'm going to change my name on birthday. That's my only plan. 

But if we are talking 2023, I want to work several jobs whilst in Uni in order to afford top surgery and T for myself, because my family is not supportive.
Tries to do well in college so i can study aboard. Can't transition here. 

Damn, i gotta admit, seeing y'all having the conditions to transition or wear fem clothes make me cry
Start laser hair removal on my face, lose some weight, and release my first album. Those are the big ones anyway. I have a lot of smaller goals that I want to accomplish too though.
[deleted]
I guess to try and get the ball rolling after a thoroughly unproductive year of being confused on my validity and watching my body amalgamate into a hairy nightmare all while losing the will to keep existing but knowing I must all while pondering about how there was a 50/50 bargain in being born and I lost out.

I might go see a therapist.
Wanting to come out
Boom! Its 2022. I got WAAAYSTED (didn't intend to but it happened -oops but everyone was so it wasn't an issue). No hangover! Had a great time talked about all kinds of things, hung out some cool people.

Start HRT

Attend pride festival

Go to uni, start on qualifications - want to become a support person for LGBTQIA+ community

Explore the pan side of things

I'm psyched!
I’m getting top surgery on January 24.
Be trans do crime
Hopefully finally starting HRT (waiting for appointment) and if there are any visible changes coming out to my kids and later to my extended family
Sticking to HRT and not letting dysphoria get to me as much as it has before. Gonna be starting my degree course, thankfully so far my Uni has been mega accepting and I've got good friends there. Hoping to slowly gain the support of my family and to determine whether or not to cut my Step-Mum out of my life.

Definitely some harder plans, but it should be a very productive and eventful year, if all goes well :)
My main resolution is actually start HRT and begin to socially transition beyond my friend circle. I also just want to work on dysphoria management, but that's a case where the former helps the latter.
hopefully gonna start t later this month!! also as my new years resolution i didn’t want to hide who i am anymore so i posted a coming out photo on my socials!! so off to a great start so far
Idk. Do school work to have it finished before holidays end and... I just don't have plans. I'm 16 yo Solarian, but I can't do shit currently, because I live in f-ing Slovakia.
Send a mail to the only lgbt friendly NGO in my country so that i can start gender affirming therapy. I just feel like other people need it more or that i will not be able to afford the therapy, i dont want my family doctor to know i want to take hrt.
I want to wear more femme clothes, and present more femme in public. I also want to get started on HRT soon whether through Planned Parenthood, Howard-Brown, Plume/Folx, or my pcp but idk which provider yet.
Coming out to family today, possibly tomorrow. Starting HRT mid-January as well, so I'm going pretty good.
Gonna come out soon... hopefully. I'm kinda just going to ramble/vent here, hopefully it makes sense. Tl;dr: I was gonna come out to my mom at the turn of the year, but my dad being there meant it would've been an unpleasant conversation, so I chickened out. 

So, my mom really likes Hallmark movies, and she watched a lot of those Christmas romance type movies ~~this~~ last year. And usually there's this really magical moment at the end, right after they finally say ""I love you"" but just before they kiss, where it starts snowing. Really dramatic and stuff. I wanted my coming out to have that kind of energy and drama to it. My plan went something like this: 

The ball drops, we both shout ""Happy New Year!"" and we hug, all as usual. And while we're hugging, just as 2022 is getting started, I'd say, ""Hey mom... I'm trans. I'm a girl."" and smile at her. Then we hug even tighter. Cue the tears of joy. I dunno, it sounds really good when I imagine it. Also ""new year, new me"" lol. 

Didn't work out, though, because my dad was there. I *think* he'd accept me *eventually*, but I don't really want to be face-to-face when he hears. The thing is, my sister is also trans, and came out a few years ago iirc. They still talk a bit, and (after a period of adjustment at the start, which is to be expected I guess) he refers to her by her chosen name and pronouns. But he's also said some vaguely transphobic bullshit that leads me to suspect he just goes along because it's easier, and not because he actually sees her as his daughter. I'm not really sure. Anyway, my dad and I don't quite get along all the time, for other reasons as well. 

So my dad being in the room meant I kinda chickened out of telling my mom (who I know for sure would be supportive) because I'm not ready for him to know, kinda? And I'd rather not get an interrogation from him about my identity and am I sure and blah blah blah. I have a feeling it would go down like that. So I didn't come out. Hopefully I'll have a private moment with my mom where I can do it, some time in the next day or two. Maybe grocery shopping. 

But I do want to come out very soon, and hopefully by next Christmas I'll be feminine enough to ask for that dress I've been daydreaming about for a little while now (go ahead, ask. I'd love to ramble about that too lol.) (Also I have no idea if that's a ""reasonable"" deadline, I don't know what my steps are for transitioning yet.) On the whole, optimistic for 2022, and if you've made it to the end, thanks for reading my wall of text.
Top surgery ✨
Move forward with scheduling the surgeries 

Get back into the workforce and find something I’m passionate and comfortable doing 

Continue my nefarious plan to make my boyfriend fall further in love with me by being an awesome girlfriend

Finish painting my 40k army (probably impossible with my current backlog)
Hopefully starting hrt and socially transitioning at school
Hoping(once my birthday comes) my parents might get me some sort of support to start T, i doubt this Will happen but I can hope I guess
Finally talk to a LGBT friendly therapist to help me unravel this mess in my head and my heart. Maybe finally come out to some people and maybe even start HRT. I want so bad to just walk around a mall and be myself...

Oh also maybe make some trans friends, especially IRL. Wanna go get color matched at a Sephora but so scared to go alone. Also talk to someone who understands.
Come out to my friends
- Bottom surgery
- Move to a bigger home 
- Get a raise at work
- Attend a DSA meeting
- Lose 30 pounds (lol) 
- Earn a certification in Linux, because why not.
Get my life back together, now that I'm freshly on E :)
I want to ditch my job and earn my living my own way(s). Like going full time on twitch, taking commissions, etc. That way I can maybe stop being depressed and stuff.
this is my transition year
Try on a skirt and get my name and gender changed at school are my main goals - probably also somehow see a therapist person idek
More a new years promise. I'll not rest peacefully for a minute until I get out of my social anxiety, depression, and get myself a social circle. As well as stop living as who people want me to be, and living like who I want to be.

I'll ask for help, I'll struggle, and I'll cry. It's all worth it though as it's a pain living in constant fear of even leaving your home, or room even.
Im going to come out to my friends, im tired of sitting there feeling like a phoney.
Be my badass self and save the world of course
I came out on my family group chat on midnight. Responses so far have been positive =D
Lose all my weight (80lbs?)
Hoping to finally figure out who i am, thats all i want,
And also that i will get a therapist this year.
I wish I will be myself, it's enough
(And start estrogens)
Well I have an appointment booked in March to try and get HRT, so that’s a main goal but I guess I have to overcome some imposter syndrome stuff as I’m constantly worrying I’m just not trans and I’m going to muck up my life lol
To start T maybe if I can figure out how too. And get a job and maybe move out.
[deleted]
Planning on starti'g transition and who know maybe having (finally) my special someone
I’m going to try and fully socially transition this year
Coming out to my nan and extended family so i have time to wear girly clothed
going to gender therapist and maybe hrt 😁
I'm hoping to start hrt and this is unrelated but I'm planning to get 10k streams on my music
Kms maybe
My new years resolution is to get back into shape, physically, mentally, and emotionally. Also to tell my dad that I'm transfem.
Happy new year everyone one, we finally beat 2021, and we can finally begin to heal.
Name change and at least the top surgery
As a non binary individual, I’d like to start hrt and start to save for surgeries I want to have
Getting permission from my Psy and endocrinologist to actually start HRT. 
I’m already out to my friends and parents (although my parents are against). 
I also wear feminine clothing all the time. 
And I have changed my first name.
Hopefully staying alive, finally meeting LGBTQ community in Sheffield to stop feeling alone all the time, start talking to a doctor and have HRT :)
Happy new year!
G-d willing ! Complete chassis over-haul FFS Bottom and maybe Top all long overdue!
Getting on the waiting list for HRT at last. I can barely make appointments for daily things, but nothing will get done if I keep putting this off
I Will start my journey towards the body I deserve.
Fitness, slim down, squats at the gym every tuesday and thursday. I'm also going to look more seriously into hormones. I'll also start to diversify my wardrobe.
Nonbinary trans hyyyyype! 💛🤍💜🖤     💙💗🤍💗💙
Maybe come out to my family. 😬 Wear more fem things in public
Change my name and come out to my mum
Get ontop of my blood tests at my gp, as I’m behind atm due to moving around a fair bit over the past few months. Pretty sure my E levels are under where they should be. Also want to start laser and buy some more clothes that feel like me. :)
Hopefully planning to come out to my siblings this year
I’m planning on coming out.
Have top surgery and perhaps come out to some of my good friends!
Have a great 2022🙌🏻
I have my first meeting with my therapist this month and hopefully I'll be able to then have a therapy spot for sure. 
If I'm lucky I can then also start hrt this year. c:
I’m only out to a handful of people so far but that’s okay, one of the people I’m out to really likes me and I hope we could start dating
growing boobies
I'm creating and committing to a months-long workout and diet regimen to reach my target weight and build muscle. I'm going to need to lose about 45 pounds, but I'm fully prepared to suffer a lot of pain to get there. I'm also going to talk to my doctor about starting on T, and when I would be eligible to do so. Once I feel like I at least convincingly pass as ""male presenting"" I'll start using my real name in interpersonal situations.
I'm glad you ask my friend.

&#x200B;

Start working out, better diet, find new hobbies like sewing, hairstyling, make up (bit more professional make up), draw, write, read, learn a new language. Find someone special.
die probably
Talk to my doctor about testosterone and start saving for top surgery!!!
Gonna try and come out, try and transition, all that good stuff
Get a house, try girl clothes maybe get HRT
Now that I have finally came out to my family in mid 2021 I want to :

1) Start t 
2) change my gender legally (it’s very easy in my country)
3) change my name legally 
4) maybe get top surgery 

I know exactly what I want.
to finally get hrt and fix my life.. somehow
finding ways to get my family to accept me
I want to fuck evrydays
Getting on the waiting list for transitioning program
Planning on getting hrt! I'm so excited I can't wait! I first have to get diagnosed, but I have an appointment this month :D
I'm going to start talking about my gender more openly and hopefully join a trans youth group. I also plan to attend a pride parade if cases don't go really high.
Hopefully start HRT. I’ve already been on testosterone blockers for half a year now, and my doctor said that our next appointment, we could start talking about estrogen. The past few year have had major leaps in transitioning for me, from socially transitioning to growing out my hair. It doesn’t feel real if I’m being honest. But I’m finally going to start estrogen soon, and that all that matters to me.
My goal for this year is consistency. I've tried super hard to be perfect and sometimes because of that perfectionism I end up just Avoiding things entirely. This year, I just want to be consistent. I've got food, healthy movement, school, and transition goals, and I hope to make some friends (especially fellow trans friends) but I don't want to be perfect. Baby steps going forward the whole year 😁
Finally accept myself truly and realize how far I have come.

New year showed me I'm good 😌
Loseing as much weight as I can to become ready for SRS. Let's what I can do this year. Waiting time however still is 2 years.
This is my year.  

I started HRT 40 days ago. I’ve been going through Laser Hair Removal, I started Voice Therapy, I’m feeling better than mentally, and working on myself. My wife and daughter are supportive, caring, and inclusive, and I couldn’t ask for me. 

It took 37 years to stop lying to myself. 2022 is going to be the year that I start living true.
Lose some weight and start hrt. And start wearing more feminine clothes. Pretty much the same old same old but I’m excited about it.
I plan to come out to my parents but I'm very nervous
Get on the list for HRT and come out to the rest of the people in my life- even though I don’t like them I need them to not deadname me at least ;-;
Me and my boyfriend plan to start our journey looking for a surrogate I’m a great stepmom to his kids but he also wouldn’t mind more
Coming out to everyone and starting to get help to fully transition and getting help for my mental health
stop dressing like a straight cis guy
I have an appointment Jan 10 to get on testosterone under on my own insurance and on my own. So excited and relieved 💜
Hopefully find the courage to come out in person. 

Hopefully find the courage to accept that I'm a straight woman and not a straight man.

Keep waiting for the right people to pass so that I don't fear coming out anymore.

Try to find a supportive friend group to help ease things
Honestly two things well maybe three. Definitely growing my hair out and getting my ears pierced at some point and probably add a little bit of T blocker again to compliment the estrogen.
Top surgery when I turn 16
Starting T and maybe (hopefully) top surgery
i hope i come out. i can’t see it anywhere near but i hope i do
I plan on finishing college, I'm just a few credits away from it, I wish I could start my transition this year but that would be a bit of a stretch in my current condition.
Planning to finally start hrt
im starting hrt this year so thats my plans !  cannot wait to be on estrogen :)
Starting a new job on the 4th and I'm raising money for my top surgery!! Woo! Happy new year to everyone and best of luck!
To lose atleast 10 more kg so that I finally can get my top surgery done this year! I have to be under 30bmi for it so..
End if January, first Appointment at Speach Therapy
3. February, first Appointment at Endo 🥰
More to come
Last year I made the resolution to live as my true self. It was a great success. In the summer I started wearing dresses. I also started my legal & medical transition late autumn. This year I will make the resolution to cut all the unaccepting people out of my life, worst being my mother. She keeps constantly misgendering and deadnaming me and then wonders when why I'm depressed and don't have energy to do anything
i want to start testosterone but i’m a minor so i don’t think it’ll be that easy, i want to have friends because the only ones i have are online friends and i want to stay alive
Planning to come out to my mother :) and after I get payed imma start paying for hrt and new clothes
I’m sure there’s plenty of ways to go about achieving what you said you want to accomplish, but for me I just dove in head first. Came out to everyone in the same week and wore women’s clothes for a weekend and when Monday came I put on slacks and a dress shirt (men’s) and I completely broke down crying. That was the last time I wore men’s clothes and I will absolutely never put them on again. 

I have never been happier in my whole life :)
Learn to truly love myself, I am fortunately able to comfortably wear feminine clothes, and most everyone I meet learns I am Trans fem within 2 weeks cuz I can easily tell people...... But sometimes tho I smile and laugh, I feel all I do is just a mask........

Cuz once I step out of the shower I see what is physically there......

BUT I AM BEGINNING ANEW


😭😢😥😧🥺😮🙂😃🥰🥰🥰🥰
Increasing my E to 2mg tonight and starting P as well.
Name change, new year new me, literally
Trying to get things in motion to get FFS a Tummy Tuck and GCS
Starting HRT
I hope I can come out as nonbinary to more people. I’d like to try trans tape for binding and go swimming shirtless. I hope I can get an appointment with a gender therapist and hopefully talk about getting top surgery in the near future, and discuss my possible need to get on t, see if that would be a good idea for me. Oh and have a serious talk to my family about who I am so they can call me a better name and stop misgendering me

Damn that’s kinda a lot but if I can do at least some of those things that would be great
Mine is to just do it. Stop beating around the bush and do what I talk about
Just started HRT last month, I'll continue that. I'll have to decide this year how far I will go with the physical changes and whether I need to come out to the rest of my family. Of course, I want to also exercise and lose weight.
Find a job. That's about it...
1. srs
2. srs

speaks for itself really
Bigger boobs
Possibly try and hit that I want to be a girl
Getting top surgery on the second  of January! That’ll likely complete my transition (with maybe a few more sculpsure/ cool sculpting sessions, but otherwise I’m good!).

Focus on the gym, study the piano! Write more papers.
My biggest goal is to at leats discover my gender to point when Im sure who I am... Im also concidering gettint T, but Im still nit sure :<
January 12 is my hearing for name change, so early 2022 will see a new me with my name and gender marker changed on my ID, possibly even on my birth certificate amendment.  I also already have an appointment for nipple tattoos, as I'll be 2 years post-top surgery in July 2022. My fiance and I also plan on having a courthouse wedding after he finishes nursing school in May, and we've got a two-week honeymoon vacation with our daughter booked later on the year. 

Assuming this next year doesn't see World War III, it's looking to be an awesome year. 

I hope everyone here has an amazing year, and that you all can make some kind of amazing progress socially, personally, financially, or professionally. New year, New you!
This isn't trans related at all, but go to at least a couple infusion appointments myself without having a panic attack. In the 4.5 years I've been going I've only managed to do that once, a week ago. PTSD is a bitch. 

Finally get my hysto. At this point it's just scheduling, paperwork and final approval. I'm chronically ill so it makes it sooo complicated. But I'm so looking forward to not losing a few days every month to excruciating pain. And not having to wear diapers to deal with Satan's waterfall. 

Clean up my apartment. Organize really, though it does need some cleaning too. 

Try more new foods. I grew up on a very stereotypical American diet and there's so many things I've never tried. If anyone's got suggestions I'd gladly take them. I really love veggies so bonus points if they're loaded with veggies.
get money and spend the money on cool clothes
I’m going to continue to lose weight, legally change my name, and finally tell my parents.
Get boobs. Play with boobs. Happy.
Mine is to be out to all the important people in my life and start hrt
coming out to my parents
I'm getting like 3 gender affirming surgeries! (I guess that's not really a resolution tho, kinda just wanted to share)
Begin living the life I never lived before.

Grow boobs.
Coming out to my family hopefully.
My goals so far are that I'm gonna get on HRT, I'm gonna come out to almost everyone that knows me through social media, start living by myself and tell my father how much of an phobic asshole he is. 

My subgoals are going to my first rock concert and travelling to a country I haven't been before.
Welp this year ima gamble all my money away to have a chance at being able to finance FFS. All or nothing babyyyy! 🥲
Hopefully finally find a therapist and do the required amount of sessions so that i can go on T ... wish me luck, 'm searching for 2 years now.
Hoping to get hrt in February without my doc moving the goalposts this time 🙃
I may not be trans but: play with masc gender presentation in more ways, survive, get an autism screening, ..... try to make myself attempt therapy......, try to regain the ability to work through a work day, be able to read / play games / watch movies / do much else with my day regularly eventually, start up iaido or some sort of exercize I guess..., make my appartment not a trash filled fire hazard of death and attempt to get it to stay that way somehow..
I plan on saving money, changing my legal name and birth certificate to more affirm my gender, learn to give myself my HRT injections, and to at least schedule an orchiectomy. Those are just my transition resolution goals. All in all a pretty big year!!
im moving into my new apartment and i want a tattoo !
I'd really like to get started on my legal name and gender change. Just reading through the process is exhausting enough though.

Also, I'd really like to get financially stable enough for Lazer hair removal. No matter how thoroughly I shave Mt face I still get those razor bumps and I feel like they really give me away. :(
Lose 40 lbs by June is the big one. Also got a side project that I hope to finish some time this year.
I hope I can build up the courage to come out after I graduate high school this year. I know my parents will accept me but it still feels scary to start being myself after all this time

Edit: I just did the math and I’ve been in the closet for nearly 6 years 💀
Wish you luck
Same. So sick of consonant time to spice things up with some E
Same here
I got my appointment to talk to my doctor about medically transitioning on the fourth of January! I'm excited!
Me too
Same. Got a session about it next weekend
All the best on your journeyyyyy
Same here but I need to convince my parents
I hope to do the same
Hope all that goes well for you
I love how you phrased that lol yess. Best of luck with your gender installation <3
have you tried turning your gender off and on again?
I hope your Blood work goes as planned, as well as HRT
kind of off topic, but are endos supposed to get your blood work done before you start HRT? i’m asking because i’m a trans guy who’s been put on T with absolutely no blood work done. i’m experiencing little to no changes and i can only see this guy once every two months. good luck with the conservative family, though! thankfully i don’t see mine much anymore, but i hope yours will come around and support you.
I wish you luck on that
I hope all goes well with that
Let’s hope that’s the case, also I wish you luck with your booking

I hope you can find a way out of the darkness and come to the light, Happy New Year, and just remember you are loved💞

40 lbs is 18.16 kg
Yeah. I powered mine off during installation and only ended up with half a gender. So be careful. 🤣
I had to have blood work done since I had an oddly high amount of femme reproductive hormones despite being amab. Progesterone, estrogen, and prolactin all super high for a cismale, but relatively similar to a cis woman (on 2/3), just with the T expected of a cis male as well. They basically had to rule out my pituitary gland being cancerous and check my blood work a couple of times to make sure that is my fasting hormone level and not some false positive. 

I think my mom will be accepting but my sister's & their husbands are just the hurdles. Im glad I have my partner at least, seems like she isn't going anywhere, anytime soon. So I can be very thankful for that.
I hope so too 😆
Thanks!
I hope too. And I wish you to be able to make your resolutions and plans come true this year ! Happy 2022 year !
Thanks ! It’s so important for me to play chess since no matter my gender and who I love, I’m simply a chess player against another chess player. And I have to play a lot for this level : studying with books and playing ( internet and in club ) takes 3 hrs per day in week
Thanks! I hope it’s gonna be ok too, and it should be ! I also hope your plans whatever they are will come true this year !  Good luck and enjoy this year as much as possible through every difficulty !
Yep I know it ! Also has a meaning in Indian ( reason why I chose it )
Thanks, you too. :)
thanks
Aww, thank you. I hope you find some too :)
Thanks, you too!
And you too, good luck! ❤️
I hope you too sweetie❤️❤️❤️
Me too. For most of my life if not all of it I hated myself. It lead to a lot of un healthy coping mechanisms and alot of depression. Since figuring it out and coming out I honestly love myself more each day.
you too!
Thanks
You as well, you're gonna look great when you do go out in those clothes
Thank you ☺️ I hope you have a fantastic new year too!! Check out the most recent season. It’s my favorite
Thank you
thanks i hope your year goes well too <3 :)
Thank you ^^ I hope everything goes we for you, too !
Thank you, I hope it all goes to plan as well. Making headway with my family, started with my aunt and wife.
Aha Thank you! Have a nice 2022 yourself! I surely hope I can get there but idk quite yet, psychologist queues are so long rn so it could be a good few months until my goal becomes a reality.
thank you <3
Me too, I bought my first dress online just after Christmas so just waiting for it to turn up now, hope you have a great year also and manage to achieve your goals also
aa thanks you too ^^
Thank you so much. It means a lot
Tysm I will
Thanks, you too! I hope you feel more comfortable soon. It felt great to dress more fem in public for the first time
thank you! if not I have my friends and my (gay) grandma lol
Thanks. I've been questioning whether I am agender or not, so it's mostly been like, do I feel gender or am I trying to be special or something?
thanks. i hope it will, cause the country i live in is very lgbt-phobic. if they let me change my name i willbe able to escape finally and live a normal life
Thank you so much!!! 

Good luck on reaching your transition goals and coming out to your friends 🥰💕
Thanks you too
Thanks so much! Same with all your goals!
thanks <3
Thanksss you tooo
you too! i’m just tired of it. New year, I’m not going to tolerate it anymore :)
Thank you! I am concerned about sleeping since I’m a side sleeper through and through. Literally impossible for me to fall asleep on my back. Might have to get me one of those special pillows.
me too.

Have a good new year btw
Thank you so much :)) I hope you have a great year too!
Yeahhhhhhh... My state currently has 20,000+ new covid cases today, had been in total lock down for almost 6 months and I'm a small business owner... So rollercoaster... Yes lol. 

Thank you, to quote my favourite artist 
""I don't know about you, I'm feelin' 22, everything's gonna be alright...""
Thank you I hope so too and all the same goes to you too. Happy new year, wishing you all the best.
Thank you ^^
Hope you have a happy 2022 too :D
Thanks haha, and it's inside my wrist, it grew on a nerve so it's especially frustrating. Have a great new year!
Thanks you too
I hope so too! She already kind of suspects that I’m non-binary and she’s cool with that, so she should be good hearing I’m FTM
I think that's the bit that annoys me the most. My life really hasn't been that hard compared to a looooot of people, a lot of the issues I face are blocks in my head, and constant paranoia.

Although, I'm in the UK, so I'd consider the paranoia justified entirely.  People over here suck when it comes to trans anything.
Thanks! Happy new year btw, i just don't have the confidence for it but I'm hoping to do it by the end of this month if not then at least in this year.
Thank you and you too. Another Kiwi - yeah!

I've been going since the egg cracked in December, I shattered it and ran lol.

Finally time I did something that helps add positivity to the world/someone's world while doing something I want to do that's also meaningful.
Thank you sweetie!
I wish you all the best this world gotta to offer
Thank you!!!
Thanks, same to you!! C:
same goes to you!! <3
Well, we aren't as bad on it when it comes to LGBT, problem is as always - not that many liberals.

And also we have here political party that is neonazi and they still didn't get cancelled, even tho they are neonazis.

But thank God, most Slovaks find them to be stupid.
Thanks a lot haha, i hope the pigeon will have my hrt for an year. I already sure about my identity, that is the best gift.
Thanks, I hope this year (and all the ones that follow, of course) goes well for you too. You seem like a very kind person.
Yee, we got COVID together and weirdly, it’s been a blast hanging out together for a week off of work together. Luckily the vaccine reduced all our symptoms to almost nothing so it’s just us chilling watching Tv for the next week or so.
I also hope you have a good 2022
Hey thanks I appreciate that! I'm 1trickPwnyta on Twitch if you want to stop by and say hi sometime. Have an absurdly awesome new year!
Tysm:))
You too!
Thanku! I wish you the same 🥰
Thanks, have a good 2022 as well
Same to you :)
My immediate family already knew and is not supportive at all, I hope the rest of my family can see things as they are. Have an amazing 2022!!
oh no lol I weigh 200lbs at the moment and I want to lose 80
Aww thank you;)
I hope you achieve all the stuff you wished for this year too
Thanks hon I appreciate it, it’s just the usual apprehension you get as you get closer to your goals, I’ll be getting the titty skittles as soon as I can hopefully! And the tattoo to commemorate getting them lol
I dont precisely know how much time it take to start transition in france but hopefully less than a year 😕
And lets just hope that my next relationship (this being me second) goes better than my first😬
Thankyou you too x
Thank you!!!!
Thank you very much honey, you too 💜
Thank you :DDD rn I just have a single out but I've got a mixtape coming (just need to mix some more of the tracks) should be out by the summer, [I have my linktree here](http://linktr.ee/shadyember) and I hope you have an amazing 2022 as well
Thank you; I really needed to read this. 2021 was filled with a lot of negative emotions for me, lots of breakdowns, identity crisis, and existential dread. I can only imagine what others are going through. You are a kind soul, and I wish that your travels bring you great fortune, love, and happiness. Have a fantastic year, and my the gods smile down upon you.
Thanks, you too :)
Thanks may yours be stellar as well!
Thank youuuuu
Also puns are a great love of mine so doubly thank you
Thanks op! Have a great new year!
Same goes to you too ❤️
Thank you so much ❤️

Thanks! <3 I'm so so so excited for this year!! seriously like I thought finally being able to be myself was going to be nice, with some minor setbacks. It's way beyond what I could have ever imagined. It's amazing.
Thank you, I greatly appreciate the love
Thank you! Me too and you too!
One small issue
Thank you
I was more thinking shei le buff but ok... I think
Thank you, this is very kind. I hope so too, I wish you the best to 2022 too
thanks for explaining :) and i’m glad you have supportive people in your life even if they’re not all so understanding
Translated from Hindi to English it would give something like lord ( and to the feminine too but I’m not sure whether there is a English feminine for “  lord “ since I only looked for it I’m French )
Aww, thank you
You’re welcome, but there’s no need to thank me
You’re welcome, and that must be tough living in said country, but keep your hopes high, anything can happen
You’re very welcome
That’s good to hear, hopefully they’ll be taken down, but all we can do is wait and see
Aww thank you, you do as well
Oh ok makes sense, I wish you luck with that
Alright I’ll be looking forward to it, the single sounded nice and thank you
Aww thank you, glad I could help
Thank you, and you’re not the only one, I feel like a broken record player from saying 2022 so many times
What is it?
No problem! I hope everything goes well for you. Maybe speak with the Endo about not seeing a lot of physical changes. I know one of my friends (transfem) saw the Endo multiple times before it was increased to a point where they say changes. And remember ""just taking more"" doesn't make it so you see changes faster, it's about a balance with your natural body/hormones.
Yeah.
Thanks :D

Ah yea that must suck"	rt3fa5	trans	694	0.99	2021-12-31 21:13:19
Parents mad at my trans sister for not dressing up in pool clothes	"Im not trans but I have a younger sister who recently came out as trans. I support her and have a good relationship with her but she feels misunderstood by our parents. Today we were planning on going to the pool. I know that my sister is quite insecure about her body and wears long sleeved clothes. She insisted on wearing a long sleeve sweater and jeans and asked if she could go to the park thats right next to the pool. My parents got very mad at her and i suggested that it could be because of her gender dysphoria. The problem is that my parents, especially my dad, doesnt like it when i intervene on behalf of my sister whenever this issue comes up. My dad is in his 60s and he is progressive for his age and the people he grew up with but hes still a little ignorant when it comes to these things. How can i help my sister with this in the future without having to make anyone upset?

Edit: Thanks for all of the advice yall, i cant thank you enough. I am kind of treading on thin ice rn because standing up for my sister could mean me and maybe even her getting punished. theyre already not happy with us and im worried if my sister makes my dad more upset she will get sent to military school, and my dad intends on making her spend the full 4 years pretending to be a boy there. im scared for her. I am willing to push my dad for my sister but i cannot get me or her hurt just because i wanna act heroic. If i act too much im gonna come full circle and might make her look bad so shell be put in that school"	"Just stay supportive of yoru sister and let keep patiently explaining to your parents why she feels the way she does. From your post it seems like they hurt her out of ignorance rather than malice, which means they just need to learn and improve.

Your parents need to realize that you're not ""intervening"", you're just trying to help them understand.
I don’t have any real great advice, just wanted to say that your sister is lucky to have you for a sibling!  Keep standing up for her when you need to, try to be as patient and calm with your parents as you can, and hopefully they’ll start to get it and come around.
I understand her plight only too well. I use a long sleeve swim shirt and a big floppy hat and sunglasses and huge man trunks to hide my currently transitioning body from the community. I live in Florida and don't need the hate in my life. I told people I have a NON infectious skin condition I have to put cream on for and it can't be in sunlight or have sunscreen on it so I have to stay covered up. I get in the pool and I do exercises and run as fast as i can doing laps. It's a great workout and people leave me alone.

If she does something like this she can still be with the family, which is all your Dad really wants, is for you all to do something fun together because time goes by fast and soon there will be no more family time.

You are a good brother keep sticking up for your sister, that's what family does. Dad will come around don't give up on him either. Love to you both.
Not every girl has a sister like you, I sure wish I do. Keep supporting her no matter what. I cannot put in words how much I appreciate what you’re doing! Thank you!
>he is progressive for his age

Yet he got angry at your sister for something literally beyond her control.... yeah he sounds lovely.
The fact your parents go as far as punishing you for helping to support your sister is a major red flag. Reminds me of companies that punish/fire workers for trying to unionize.

You're absolutely doing the right thing by defending your sister. If you want to escape trouble maybe you could talk to your sister in cases like these and be the one to suggest stuff instead of her? For example if you're the one to suggest going to the park then you're not defending her, she's just tagging along.

That said, some things are worth doing, even (maybe in this case *especially*) if your parents disprove. Stay strong <3
You are a hero. What your doing for your sister may be causing you to suffer consequences with your parents, but you are a hero for standing up for her. Most of all, your her hero.

Every trans person would be thrilled with someone like you as a sibling. We need more people like you.

It may suck now, having to deal with these consequences, but it will pay off. Your sister will remember and in the future when your not under the thumb of your parents, you'll appreciate going through the punishments because you are doing the right thing.

Thank for being an amazing ally and being there for your sister. We appreciate you! ❤️
You're the older sibling, It's on you to protect your sister, even from your parents.  sometimes people have to get upset.
Mmmm.

Your parents punish you and sometimes ""get violent"" for... wh -- caring about your sister's well-being?  Isn't that something they want you to do?

Unless it interferes with their *authority,* I suppose.

So I'm a trans woman and I still hate swimming in public pools.  I don't like the way the wet clothes stick to my body and literally *show* people that I'm trans.  So yeah, I imagine you're right about that being the problem.
Oh honey, that edit? You dad isn’t progressive at all.
Your doing more then you no sweety that fucking amazing keep it up 😊
Unfortunately you can't make everyone happy. But i bet you make your sister feel supported and she's going to need that more than your parents.
There's hundreds of reasons she may not have wanted to wear a swimsuit. What a weird thing for parents to be mad about. 

If she doesn't want to wear a swimsuit then she doesn't have to.
Be positive and encouraging. Never make the experiences negative, especially if she takes a chance and then gets cold feet. Let her just ease into it on her own but also gentle nudging can go a long way.
Without having to make anyone upset. That’s the rock you will trip on forever. Drop the idea that you can fight for something, stand up for someone or yourself and make everyone happy in the process. Get comfortable at making people uncomfortable if you wanna voice your opinions and really uncomfortable if you want those opinions to be taken seriously and super uncomfortable if you want action to follow your opinions.
continue to be her advocate to your parents until she can find the strength to advocate for herself. show her how it's done!!
Honestly the pool is lame af (I can’t swim 💀)
This shit breaks my heart.. I am so sorry. No kid should be burdened with having to protect their sibling from their parent.

You are a good sibling, and she sounds lucky to have you. If you have someone you can trust.. teacher.. counselor.. an adult you trust, maybe try reaching out to them. Your father sounds abusive from your further comments.  This situation goes beyond what anyone here can help with, beyond offering support and stuff.

Please stay safe, and save all the money you can so you can GTFO and get your sister out too. Once you are an adult there is nothing he can do
Well the military in the end will help with any kind of medical she my need and otherwise couldn't afford
How old is your sister?
My advice is to be aware of when giving advice, even when well-intentioned, would cause your parents to double down. You mentioned in your post that your dad does not respond well to interventions on your part. My family's like this too - sometimes they feel on the defensive when another actor comes into a conversation between two people. 

You seem like a really great sibling and your sister is lucky to have you. But if your advice is harming more than it's helping, perhaps you should consider leaving the issue between your parents and your sister. 

My guess is they will respond better when she defends herself instead of having you intervene. You obviously know your family better than me though, so take it or leave it.
I think you should show your dad this post. Maybe print it out and leave it for him where he gets ready in the morning. Any rational human would get feels from this.
Just keep loving her, let her know that you are always there for her, and support her and that she can always talk to you, and that will be enough support for now. When you're older and can have your own place, maybe then you both can stay together. This is the way.
How does your sister feel about the situation and what your role should be?  You should speak with her privately so you understand what she wants before taking any action on her behalf.  

Either way, I am sure she is grateful for your support.  No matter what happens - be the brother that she needs.  It sounds like you are already well on your way.  I wish I had support like you are giving her.
Keep defending your sister. You have no idea what that means to her. One of my sisters is my biggest supporter, and I have never been able to properly convey to her what it means to me. She thinks she’s gets it. All I can say is your sister will never forget you being there for her. In a world where it can feel like everyone is against you as a trans person you may very well be the only thing that feels good to her. Keep being there. You’re amazing. My love to you 💜
Thanks for being a supportive sibling!
I want to share something it took me decades in therapy to really understand: The things your parents do to your sister and you are not your fault or hers. Even when they frame it as a response to your behavior, they are adults with the positive duty to raise you as free from fear, coercion and danger as possible. A Cis man who even threatens to force his Trans daughter to attend military school as a boy is an abuser, even if he's ""progressive"" in many ways. And if you face punishment for sticking up for her, that's another red flag. Take it from someone who had emotionally abusive parents & spent decades in therapy overcoming it.

Seek IRL help and guidance if there is a supportive adult in your life that you can trust to discuss these things with who will not report what you say to your parents (especially your father) & to whom your sister is comfortable coming out. If there is no such adult, do your best to find one and get their input. These are problems no kid should have to deal with, and I am sorry you and your sister have to. 

PS - I also want to mention how lucky your sister is to have you. Continue giving her the love and support you already are.
Slightly off topic, but! I am a cis woman with a real (non infectious) skin disease very similar to what you are claiming! It's called dermatomyositis, I won't get into all the details, but basically I HAVE to stay out of the sun as much as possible and if I am in the sun for any period of time I have to wear mineral sunscreen. I also have steroid cream I use occasionally if I have a flare up, which is kinda like an itchy sunburn that doesn't go away normally.
Anyway, I just thought it might be helpful for you to know that a disease like this does exist, so if anyone ever challenges you on it you can give them something to chew on.
When they get upset i get punished and yelled at for it.
ice cold take there. it is NEVER a child's responsibility to protect their siblings from abusive parents.
14
aww I'm so sorry you have to endure this. I hope there is relief for you from this condition. Thanks for the info, I'd hate to claim I had something wrong with me that I didn't, weird karma or something, so I'm just saying I have a condition (never saying if it is medical or just mental or imagined) and I let them make up whatever narrative they want in their own heads. I don't think I could remember the name of it either! I have other conditions I can't remember the name for but that's just getting old. Thanks for taking the time to respond. Great info. Much love.
as fucked as it is you are protecting your sister and she will thank you for it far into adulthood. your parents are in the wrong and you do have the choice to not take on their shit and it wouldn’t be your fault that it then went back to her but i think your little sister has already greatly benefited from knowing there is someone in the home who understands her and is willing to fight for what she deserves
That's life dude, I'm so sorry you don't have the parents you deserve.
You're doing everything right. Unfortunately your parents are human, they're wrong sometimes. And often when people are wrong they take it poorly.
for sure not their responsibility it’s not fair or fight but sometimes older siblings do it anyway because they want to protect their younger sibling. sometimes you’d rather sit there and take it then be in the other room hearing them get treated that way
That's too bad she's so young that she can't just leave.  I'm sorry your parents are behaving that way.  Give your sister hugs from me.
I cant stand up for my sister before my dad becomes very aggressive. If i do anything that he takes personally he will scream and in some cases get violent. Because im a minor im dependent on him and if I do thinks that he does not like that will affect me. He is already considering sending me to a christian private school and my sister to a military school. i see where youre coming from but im not tryna piss my parents off especially when theyre the ones who can subdue me.
💯agreed
Yeah,but I couldn’t see my sister get treated like this so at first I would protect and if it isn’t working I would call the police because I see my sister get treated like that.
my parents tell me she can stand up for herself but shes the sibling who ""behaves the best"" and so she reacts to it in the most passive way possible to not get punished.
Hey I'm really sorry to tell you this, but as someone who witnessed similar things in some of my friends households: this is abuse. Your parents are being abusive. I know the lines can get blurry because you love them and they love you, but that doesn't undo the damage they are inflicting on you and your sister. Feeling afraid of your parents/ being afraid to stand up for yourself or your sibling is not normal. You and your sister need to keep your heads low until you get the chance to move out.

While you may want to protect your sister please keep in mind, that it would be your parents' responsibility to protect the two of you in the first place.

I wish you all the luck and I'm sending you all the love in this world.
If your dad is screaming and getting violent, you need to contact a trusted adult such as a teacher or school counselor and ask for help. Stay safe, OP
This is dreadful. The two of you are captives to his whims, and there is an ongoing threat of exile hanging over your heads.

I have no doubt he thinks he's doing what's best for you two. But that kind of thinking has been a cover for countless historical atrocities. Forcing someone to do what you think is what is best for them never turns out well. And, in my experience, it is very difficult to get through to such a person.

I wish I could give you an escape plan. But it looks to me like you two need to lay low and comfort each other and try not to set him off. I also think, as others have said, that you two should start planning an escape. The sooner the better, but make sure your plan is airtight. These kinds of situations have a way of escalating.
they dont do it to the point where i would have to call the police. i mean they still love us, but my dad doesnt really understand what she is going through. and he has problems of his own. like, alot of problems. he had a really shitty childhood.
i always reacted that way as well when i was in trouble but i was the older sibling. when it comes down to it everyone reacts differently and internalizes things differently. it’s not your responsibility as the older sibling to protect her from your parents but as someone who internalizes things not having the acceptance of parents is awful, i think as long as you’re still sticking up for her in private and telling her that they are wrong and she should do what feels right for her you would not be doing anything wrong if you didn’t take on the responsibility of changing your parents’ mind. it is very healing to have someone stick up for you though so i think what you did with the pool and trying to give your parents some psycho-education was very effective and kind
Oh sorry, my answer wasn’t really based on your post and more at the context Frontverlauf comments above  talking about its not the siblings responsibility to protect the other sibling from abusive parents

I told my GF, I couldn't wait any longer!	"

Last night I just told her, the need to say something became so strong I couldn't breathe. I posted some stuff asking for help or validation yesterday but it turned out when you know, you know. I showed her my post from yesterday because I was already trying not to freak out before I told her so I didn't think I could explain things properly with words (check my post history if you fancy a read, be warned it's long) 

She's so accepting of me and I love her so much. She had questions but far less than I thought she would. I couldn't have hoped for a better response from the first person in my life I've told

Today she's going to help me shave, try makeup and some of her clothes! I'm so lucky"	"Congratulations!!! that's such a huge step for both your and your relationship for communicating openly with one another I'm really happy to hear it went well <3
🥳🥳🥳
That's awesome! Make sure to keep talking to each other. It's a big change, but love and trust are powerful forces. I'm so happy for you!
I recently told my girlfriend too and it's a similar situation, no matter how bad things get at least we have her ❤️❤️
That's wonderful and lovely to hear, sounds like you have a great gril.there!
Always love reading positive stories like this ❤
I told my GF last weekend and she took it really well. I’ve just started HRT so I knew I couldn’t put it off any longer. We talked about everything, a very emotionally draining weekend to say the least. There were a lot of tears, as she had hopes of us getting married someday, but we’re both heterosexual women so that dream died and I feel terrible about that. I’m glad she’s accepting it, and we’ll continue to live together and maybe even grow old together, but as sisters rather than a couple, and that hurts her more than I can say. From my point of view, the relief of not having to keep myself hidden is close to euphoric, and I make sure to show her my true self everyday so she doesn’t get confused, we agreed I can’t bounce back and forth in gender as that would upset her even more. Good luck to all the couples that have to deal with this, it’s not an easy road and our girls get crushed when they learn the truth, there’s no getting around that.
Trans supportive partners save lives and its not something we talk about enough
Aww this kinda reminds me when my gf came out to me 😍 I'm so happy for you guys
I wish I could get my partner to help me shave my back. That's the only part I can't reach -.-
Congratulations
I did the exact same a few nights ago, I sent her an essay only to find out she fell asleep, longest 30 mins of my life! 

But I woke her up and sat with her as she read the text and she is also supportive and thinks we can make it work (we have 2 children together).

We seem to have both got the best scenario out of this and I am so happy for you and myself and anyone else who is currently lost but building up the courage!

It is so liberating! 

Much love 🖤
that is awesome, i am very happy for you, and i do hope you two have a very happy life together sharing this. ;-)
That’s awesome! My partner and I are both bi and it’s honestly a huge comfort. We’ve both questioned our gender before and it’s so nice to know that if one of us (or both of us!) turn out to be genderqueer in some way, we’re still going to love each other.
Awesome!!
[removed]
Awesome! I'm happy for u
Congrats, that’s great!
EEEEEEEEE thats amazing.
Good for you! Sometimes the anticipation and anxiety is so much worse than the result. I'm so glad your partner is so supportive!
Yesssss that's the best! I'm so happy for you!
I think you’ve been handed a golden ticket lifeline.  A supportive partner is something many people don’t get.  I’m so pleased for you on so many levels, well done for coming out to her!  It took guts.  
And how awesome is it thy she’s literally getting involved and helping you?  My GF and I do little make up evenings a couple days a week.  
I get pretty bad dysphoria so I’d probably avoid looking at my face so much and in so much detail if she didn’t encourage me like that

I think a huge appreciation post is in order for all the supportive partners. If mods agree, I might try to organise something on r/mypartneristrans when they open back up x
YOUR GF will need time to process and learn about what you have shared. Be considerate of her feelings and her need to talk to you and maybe someone else  about your coming out. I wish you both happiness
So glad to hear your relationship's going stronger (tbh who would feel happy neglecting themselves) so glad to hear this, imma be happy all day for u2 :')

So happy for u!! ❤❤

You are a thoughtful person and I did not have to presume you  needed my advice, however, I am happy to know you and GF a d doing well.  Be Safe
Thank you very much ❤️ it's something I've been wanting to tell someone for at least 15 years. I'm so happy with how she reacted, I spent until 3am crying with happiness and it looks like I'm not done yet today either haha
😁😁😁
We've been speaking about it for hours, I'm worried I'm annoying her with how much I have to say but I know she's just happy for me. Thank you I'm so happy for me too
I'm so happy for us, we're lucky to have girls like them :D even if my family and friends don't accept me (I'm sure most of them will though) I'll still have her
I really do, thank you so much. I'll probably be posting more over the next few weeks haha I'm hoping to get to a point I can swap back to my usual reddit account too so I can stop using this throwaway. I'll get there eventually
I'm happy you are finally yourself and sad that's how things ended up. It's great that she's supportive of you though and I hope you are both the best people you can be and that you both find someone else ❤️
I think without her acceptance of other trans people I wouldn't have had the courage to come out. I can't wait to tell everyone and start being the true me. It'll take a little while though, it's still incredibly scary despite being so relieving
That's so sweet, thank you. I'm happy for you two too :D
Just ask girl haha that's what I did :D
Thank you very much ❤️
I'm so happy for you! It's such a weight that's been lifted I can't even begin to explain. Sorry for the late reply apparently I stopped getting notifications haha
Thank you very much and I hope so too :D
My partner is Bi too, I'm sure that helped her accept me haha personally I'm only in to women, I guess that makes me a lesbian then
Thank you :D
I can't wait to :D
Thank you very much :D
Thank you :D
Thank you so much :D
It definitely was, I was so relieved after. More relieved than I think I ever have been
Thank you so much :)
I'm so lucky, I know for sure my coming out to my family will be better than most people's experience and I'm grateful for that

She's the best, we went shopping today and she bought me lipstick, deodorant and a nightgown so I can feel comfortable in bed. I'd be totally down for that too, if a post pops up I'll leave a comment x
Of course however so far she's taken it in stride. She can't wait to do girly things with me. I'm completely aware that it could be shock and I'm ready for anything negative in the future but I'm happy being happy for now :D thank you and I hope you are happy too
Thank you very much and exactly that haha I've wanted to tell someone for years. I wanted to tell her when we met a couple of years ago. I guess I resigned myself to just being a guy. I'm done with that though, time for the real me :D
I'm so happy, I feel like I've spent 3 days crying haha oh wait I have. Happy tears of course
Thank you :) ❤️
Thank you very much ❤️
Thank you very much, I'm so lucky to have her in my life :D
It has been a hectic couple of days haha
Thank you for commenting and we're doing great. In fact I'm going to post a picture on reddit soon :D I'm feeling so damn happy
Oya. Definitely pace yourself at the start. If you see signs of her getting burnt out, let her ears rest.
Yea for sure, I felt the same when I came out to my partner
We say thank you 😍
[removed]
hecc yes, no more over-conforming- and after all, at the end of the day the real change will be your mood <3 nothing else has really changed
Definitely will but so far she's loved speaking about it with me :D
Thank deities my wife and I know how to handle my rambling. She'll very politely let me know when I need to shut up for a bit so she can think. It's gotten worse after coming out, apparently I'm bubbly now. Not used to being so happy.
I've only been out less than a day and already getting creepy messages. Love it xD
I said that earlier to her haha I feel completely different but nothing's changed
Perfect. Oh, and even if she needs a rest, find other people to yap to. Online or otherwise. Talking helps process complicated thoughts and emotions.
Hehehe Nice Work Chic lol It Sounds like you have Truly Found your INNER SEALF and are Definitely doing the right thing?
Will definitely be posting and commenting more over the next few weeks haha are there any places off reddit you can recommend?
100%
Try searching for your local (or the nearest) LGBT center! Many have health services, counseling, events, and groups specifically for trans folx, I know mine has been super helpful.
Thank you very much, I'll look in to that over the weekend. For a couple of days I'm going to try and present as feminine at home to see how I feel. Honestly excited to try :D"	m7nrf5	trans	687	0.99	2021-03-18 10:17:28
The “I only have my old pre transition warm clothes” look		"When I can wear what I do now and look as cute as you. I'll have made it.
That hoodie is super cute on you, it's unisex anyway so rock it!
There's snow on the ground already where I live and all I have is super thin leggings, skirts, skinny jeans, and women's t-shirts-- help!!!!

I have a bin of old hoodies in the attic, but I don't feel like I pass as well in them :(
Adorable 😍
Omg girl you so cute! I love the comfy-chic look. Git it girl! ❤❤
Super cute
Your so cute
Looking cute.
I love your smile. :)
cute, regardless!
.....Or dye the hoodie.  but it looks cute just as it is.
You look exactly like Millie Bobbie Brown
You just look like a normal Wisconsin girl in the winter.
You could always dye the hoodie strings lavender or something.
You look cute! Rock it lol
Cute af.
[deleted]
Thanks❤️
Wear the hoodies over other outfits. You can always take it off inside. Wear the leggings under your jeans. Also check the thrift shops in your area for cheap secondhand winter coats and sweaters. Also, if you have a Kohls or tj maxx, they usually have super cute coats and sweaters for cheap.

I feel ya though. I don't have a whole lot of warm tops and only a few pairs of pants, plus I'm gonna have to ride my bike through thr snow to see my therapist so I can get approved for hormones. On the plus side my older sis gave me a super warm and wind resistant jacket cause her boobs outgrew it. 🤣)
Thanks!
Gotta be honest not what I’m going for lol
I've been wearing a few of the hoodies over some of my other clothes, but the leggings just make me feel so good-- I can't hide them lol. Pretty much all of my clothes come from thrift shops though lol. My town is relatively small and isolated, so we don't have any of those stores, but there's a few I plan to check out :) I appreciate the suggestions though :) <3

It'll be -30° in no time here and I'll be bundled up in my Canada goose jacket anyway, so I really only need stuff to get me from now until parka season. I *really* wish I could somehow trade that jacket in for the women's equivalent because it makes me feel way too bulky as it currently is lol.

I got just two styles of clothing, business and badass.		"First pic looks like your about to train The One
Second pic has Linda Hamilton in T2 vibes.
I don't know why but your outfits give me Jojo's Bizarre Adventure vibes
Both seem to be greatass though, im soo confused
The first one looks like something from the matrix
The badass is a good look, but the glasses make you look like a matrix character in business one.
GIRLLLLLL I love the badass look! Keep that shit up!
Booth are good
Morpheus and Sarah Connor
You seriously look like the super cool bad lady in the new Jurassic World movie!

Behold: https://villains.fandom.com/wiki/Soyona_Santos
Which one is which? 😂
You look like you're about to over season an expensive steak.
My bot just died as soon as he read animal trafficker
lol
Which one is which I see only badass 1 and badass 2
My bot seems to like 😍 your bot immensely! And, my bot would like to call you; u/hot&sexyfiliponodumbass
Is that feasible??? Lmao
Holy crap
Went from Matrix to Terminator
Hell yeah, girl. You look snappy as fuck.
Damn, you're stunning! Badass style really suits you
You looks like the main character from a game! Looking amazing
Looking great in both
Business look is pretty badass too.
Ah the duality! To look like you’re from the matrix or from top gun
Can I ask why this is in the trans sub?


Edit: I see you have the trans flag next to your name, but I'm still confused
All I see is the thermostat going up in the room >.>
Wow! Ang ganda niyo po. 😍
Either Orpheus from the matrix or Sarah Connor from terminator. Both killer badass looks. Count me jealous 🤣
It looks to me like your two styles are business badass and casual badass
Such cool clothing. Hope you have fun.
You a business badass and an actual badass, me a deadass 💀💀💀
They're both badass.

Did you forget to upload the business one?

I'm confused.
Damn, I love the look !
Where’s the business one? You showed two pics of you looking badass
First is evil tally hall
You’re absolutely gorgeous!
😳 damn I don’t know which pic is hotter
holy shit that second pic really does look badass
They both badass, just in different ways :D
mr anderson
You're not the first person who've said that.
I do want to cosplay Joseph Joestar, but I'm not that buff to pull it off.
Greatass? But my butt isn't visible in either photos. 😋
I see that as a complement still.
And?
Hey thank you, and I will!
Heyy, we have something in common. Occupation: Animal trafficker

You're right. The one with the bike could be drug deal business attire.
I'm gonna slap it sensually first.
Thank you!

Why don’t you check her profile? It clearly says “trans girl” in her profile…
Maybe I should take off my suit to cool off.

You're not wrong, the one with my bike is just my regular street clothes.

Hey thanks you!

Somebodys going to enjoy having legs for days.
Girl you fill that outfit amazingly! I love it so much. How happy and comfortable do you feel now? And looking beautiful and gorgeous sister. From one sister to another hugs.
You look so pretty!

Your legs!!! Are to DIE for!!!

you look great, your hair is amazing 🥰
that's an adorable outfit ☺️
Because you are!

And you look so great in that outfit! Congrats on the first of what I'm sure will be many feminine outfits! It suits you so well!
You look great and cute \^\^
You look great!
Gosh that looks so good on you 😍
I really like your style, it looks good on you!
You should feel pretty regardless of the outfit!
Youre so beautiful honeybun!
Omg, You are rocking it. You not only feel pretty you look pretty too. I don't know you, but I am glad you are able to express yourself in a way you hadn't before.
You really are! Proud of chu :3
You look amazing! You are killing that outfit! <3
Love it. Keep it up.
You look amazing!
It’s a fab outfit and you look very pretty in it x
vous avez de tres belles jambes
Thank you :3
I feel much more confident now, I was really afraid of not finding anything that looks good on me and never imagined finding something that pretty
Aww, merci :3
It’s so much fun and more freeing yourself. When I bought my first normal clothes I was so happy. Girls clothes are the best. I wear a bra daily and I feel comfortable in my own skin wearing the clothes I should of been wearing when I was closeted. I am proud of you Sister, hugs.
Yes it feels incredible, the thought of starting to casually wearing feminine clothes in public kinda scared me but now I actually can't wait for the weekend when I'm invited to a christmas dinner of my local trans community and enjoy the thought of finally walking around in public as the real me"	ecu72d	trans	658	0.99	2019-12-19 14:50:34
The ultimate goal for me is to look like a woman regardless of makeup or clothing. Some day that goal will be realized. It will include surgeries, but I’m okay with that. (Hair, please grow faster 🥺)		"God damn I really respect that. I’m a fierce ally of this community and I just love being reminded how strong you all are. I wish you all the happiness you seek OP, I believe you’ve arrived at your dream already, and anything else is icing. Be well.
Honestly, that’s my goal too

Basically I just want to be seen as a woman no matter who looks at me and from what angle
Sweetie, your hair is darling. It doesn't have to be long to be femme. You seem to be learning from your explorations into how to pass. If I saw you on the street, I would have looked to admire and not because I questioned if you were a cisgal.
Saaame! I just want to go to the bakery in the morning in nondescript joggers and a hoodie and be recognized as a women.
Same girl same. We will get there though slow and steady
you definitely already pass as female! and look amazing!!
[deleted]
You look amazing! Also, that tattoo is super cool
wow you are so cute omg
I love your hair and makeup! You already look adorable
Yeah. At first glance I thought you were just Dutch
I have a similar choker to that actually =D
You look amazing! You’re so stunning. And you have the dopest style!!
that hair gives me rizzo vibes, i love it
your makeup is so cute ♡
Me looking at the pic

*god that hair looks gorgeous*

Me reading the text

*god that would look gorgeous*
you look great! i think thats a really admirable goal
so cute!!! i love your hair:D
Oh ma god you are so incredibly cute 💜💜💜
Thanks for killing my already low self esteem 🙂
Cute with short hair
I'm getting a little jealous...
I like your hair the way it is, it’s cute and feminine and I think it suits you quite well
Whether you believe me or not you already pass in my opinion but that being said, nothing wrong with wanting to go the extra mile or even if it’s just for personal satisfaction you do you, best wishes.
If it helps I'm afab and barely pass as a woman without makeup 😝 your goals are totally valid tho and I wish you luck. Lovely photo 🥰
Right there with you girl, but at least we see you for who you are already! Keep pushing you'll definitely get there!
Thank you 🙂 haven’t arrived there yet though. Just in the process.
Yep! Because putting a face full of makeup, wigs, etc. every day can be draining. Along with it, I want to be able to go without makeup and still look like a woman, makeup every single day ruins my skin.
Same but w andro. It's why I decided on bottom surgery only. I want to be CONFUSING
It’s not just wanting to be gem I would just like it that even if my hair is short to be easily considered a woman. Which is why long hair is a must because with short hair im not considered a woman or even a trans woman in the public eyes
Yep!!! I think voice has the biggest impact on something like that. But the appearance part it’s very difficult to get to that level where even when you don’t try people assume that you are female.
Nope nope nope. Not yet. Once someone that I’ve never met calls me “she” when I have no makeup and not wigs on. Then I might agree 

I appreciate it though 😍
Nope nope nope. Not yet. Once someone that I’ve never met calls me “she” when I have no makeup and not wigs on. Then I might agree lol
Thank you c:
Awe thanks!
Thank you !!
Thanks :)
Awe thanks :) you’ll love it more when it’s actually long lol
How am I killing your self esteem?
Jealous of what??
I wouldn’t end up using it regardless, it just doesn’t seem like it’ll help
And also, I don’t need a wig as I already have very feminine hair
I’ll put it this way

If I end up transitioning, I want to be able to move half way across the country, and everyone there would think I was a girl at first glance
say what you like. you are still beautiful!
hmmmm...I just felt that you (with the makeup) look better than me😂😂😂"	og3wav	trans	648	0.98	2021-07-08 09:40:28

Oh goodness gracious. I think I found a new idol to worship😳🥵❤

You look so fem, my brain immediately started questioning why you don't have boobs
Ahfjfb you look amazing!!! :DD I have old prom jacket laying somewhere in closet and after the real changes hit me, I wonder how I'm going to look in it. (I look like an idiot as a man in it so this gives me a bit of hope that maybe fashion might be finally something for me hahah) but you look really amazingly beautiful in it!😜🤩😄😄
Woah 👀
Fab girl.🌹🌹🌹♥️
Ahah, this jacket smells a bit janky too tbh.  But it’s been sitting in the closet for at least a few years untouched.  Felt like Indiana Jones unearthing a relic.  Had to blow the dust off and everything.  Maybe baking soda or dry cleaning your clothes would help with the smell? Alternatively you could cleanse them with fire.
[deleted]
mission accomplished then 🥰
Ain't easy to be a sub huh? Trust me hun cus were in the same boat.
Fire would be my preferred method. I can always get more, better, clothes. Traded in my Dickies for capris a while ago anyway so it’s no loss (the shirts stay tho - what a collection I have)
I'm sorry I'm dying at this... omg Alex... I can't stop laughing 😂
Uhhh, I would normally agree with you but I’ve proven many times that my sense of smell is insane. So while yes it is probably a psychological rejection - I do actually smell and hate it. I’m not the one that called me a bloodhound (previously wolf-man) I just embrace it

Therapist wants me to be more fem	"I've been out to my therapist and have expressed my want to start hrt when I turn 18. She recommends I ""become more feminine"" before starting. I have no clue what she could mean?

Besides make-up to clean up my face, I genuinely can't think of much that I would need before taking hrt??? What might I be missing?

Update: I went in in fem clothes and said my intention to take HRT this summer. She is supportive of me and even taught me how to use insurance. Thank you so much for all the recommendations and insight! You all mean so much to me."	"Yeah, mine said the same.

Fortunately, I already planned on cosplaying as sailor (freddy) mercury at the nearby convention for a while, so that was easy.

The important part for your case is: Was it a recommendation, or a requeriment?

Cause the doctor just gave me the hormones when I told him I always wanted to be a butch lesbian and keep wearing the same, and seing myself in drag caused me a lot of dysphoria.

(The convention was a week after I started HRT anyway, and, due to some quirk of my brain, if it's a costume it doesn't count as dysphoria-inducing... My brain is weird.)

Edit: I get it you're young, so it may not be as easy for the doctor to believe you, as it was for me at the tender age of 31
HRT does a lot for some people and very little for others.  There is so much work that goes into transition for most of us beyond HRT.  There are a lot of things like voice training, wardrobe, etc. that are totally separate from HRT.  I think what your therapist is saying is that you need to be prepared for what you’re looking to take on which is much bigger than her writing a recommendation letter.

That said, I entirely understand that it can feel dysphoric to try on clothes, do voice practice, etc. when you’re not feeling like yourself, but you need to push through that and get through the awkward phase.  Most people can’t just flip a switch overnight and suddenly go from being perceived 100% male to being perceived 100% female.
It's not a bad idea to experiment if you're comfortable. However, there's no requirement to how fem you have to be to start HRT.
Noooooo. Bad, get a new therapist. They want you to present before transitioning. It's an old gatekeeping method that's outdated and humiliating. She's either ignorant or doesn't have your best interests in mind. I lost more years than I'm comfortable admitting because of someone like her.
So it is possible that she's just trying to keep you moving forward. I know that's a thing mine does, just kinda asks about goals and plans and stuff. Usually Im not sure but she asks anyway in an attempt to keep me from stagnating
Whatever things you’ve thought about doing for yourself, I think your therapist is encouraging you to experiment with. Nail polish? Longer hair, headbands, braids, and buns, hair tutorials? Make up? Skirts, jumpsuits, feminine jackets, blouses, styled t-shirt/crop top looks? Bra fitting? Purses, shoes, jewelry, ear piercing? more feminine accessories like phone case or notebook for school?

It’s all up to you what you want to do and if you feel ready to do it in public, with friends, or just alone. Experiment, take tons of selfies and share with trusted friends, take time to edit with filters and stickers or whatever your skill set is just so you get used to seeing yourself anew. 

And most of all, have fun. This process should be exciting and enjoyable more than terrifying (even if it’s that too sometimes)

Edit to add: only so the stuff you feel like. Not every women does all or any of these things. Be yourself and have fun with whatever you’re excited about.
My appointment withe my therapist is tomorrow (im planning to come out to her) and this is exactly what I fear
It depends exactly what she means. If she wants you to cross-dress before HRT, avoid that if you can, but I do actually recommend presenting as a more feminine man to those around you if you can do so safely. That's what I did, and it made everyone's reactions much more of an ""Oh, that's what it is"" rather than a surprise, which was much easier to handle. I started wearing unisex clothing,  (or more specifically women's versions of male clothes, jeans etc), started painting my nails, got my ears pierced, and so on.
Awesome. I like you! You ask the right questions.

You just had a first hand experience in how stupid humanity is. 
You be exactly who you are. Please do not follow yet another set of expectations. Life is to short to not be your awesome self, not after how far you have come and what you have gone through. 
It is not makeup nor clothing, not your voice, no demure posture or heals, it is not your hair or your preferences that make you your gender. Be yourself and then you are obviously 100% who you are.
You got me celebrating you here already.

get a new therapist lol.. just women don’t have to be feminine… and i’ve gotten way more feminine just being on hormones, it just comes naturally.. when you first start off you’re awkward with who you are, but the more your body gets those hormones in it, your true self will come out more… it takes time…. pls get a new therapist! wishing you the best
Ware some lip gloss and eyeliner dye your hair a cute color get a few skirts off Amazon paint your nails or toes get some women's saddles shave your legs. Buy a purse.
It could be one of three things. 

1 an old gatekeepy way of ""making sure you're trans"" by forcing you to do something possibly humiliating and dangerous depending on the community you live in, i.e. making you have ""lived experience"" and probably being the butt of a lot of jokes and especially looking like ""a man in a dress"" 

2 she's trying to encourage you to be prepared for it as there's a lot of things about passing and being a woman that aren't influenced by hrt, things like mannerisms, voice, wardrobe, makeup, etc. And she wants you to make sure you are prepared with those things first.

3 she wants you to express yourself more and make steps towards being yourself and not limiting yourself to hrt, thinking it'll fix everything. 

Now if you ask me, it's the first one, but let's hope for the best
https://www.folxhealth.com/ give this a look see
You can change your mannerisms, how you speak, how you sound when you speak, how you walk and dress.
if its genuine advice they might just be asking you to embrace who you want to be more openly, it can be very hard to get over the discomfort of acting feminine from years of being told ur not allowed too. for example i for one have been on hrt for a year and a half, just started working on a feminized voice but im usually too anxious to actually do it and usually dont. i could see my therapist telling me to try it more without it being like an insensitivity
Wtf that sounds totally crazy. Our therapists should never comment on how we present or encourage us to present how they perceive more “acceptable”. Sorry you’re going through this geez.
This is a red flag, without hormones you may have a harder time passing and may internalize negative reception you get to that, bad therapists sometimes use that to determine patients to be unready as a form of gatekeeping, sort of like a preemptive gender conversion therapy. By itself it doesn't necessarily mean that she doesn't have your best interests in mind but if you feel that you are ready, assert as much to her and observe carefully how she reacts.
I think they probably mean present more feminine such as the social transition not necessarily with make up but with clothes and a different hairstyle
I think that it should be something you want to. Some people don't want to be fem presenting before they have a body they feel comfortable to show.

If it is something you want to, then I think you should do it. I've read it and you said you did start using more feminine clothes, so, that's a really nice step. 

What i believe your therapist said, or rather, tried to say, is to be yourself, explore your feminine side, try some dresses, skirts, makeup, longer hair, etc. And see what you like, how you feel about it and, start socially transitioning before starting the medical transitioning.

It is what I would say to anyone that asked me what they should do. Try things out and go on your own time.

Also, femininity is different for everyone. If you feel feminine with Caterpillar boots, combat pants and a hoodie, that's valid

Either way, I hope you're happy with what you chose to do, and if you don't feel comfortable, it's just clothes/hair, you can always go back. Wish you the best
That is bollocks. Just because you are a woman, does not mean you need to be girly. Not all women want to be a Barbie.
Definitely be weary of any therapist suggesting how you should or shouldn’t present.
There’s enough pressure on all of us as it is….
Ok, scanning through all of the responses, they are mostly clothes, make-up, and voice.  I waited until 2 years ago because I lived the male life that was expected of me.  BUT I studied and practiced mannerisms.  How do women walk, hand gestures, play with their hair or their earrings.  Their facial expressions, how they pick things up, how they hold their knife and fork.  How do they chew their food.  How do they lick their lips when out with the girls or on a date with a guy.  How do they enter a stall in a public bathroom when they come out of the stall and walk to the sink to wash theirs hands (hopefully)? Do they look around?  Do they just keep to themselves and focus on washing their hands, or do they look around?  How do they get in and out of a car or a booth at the restaurant?  How do they blow their nose in public. How do they sit and cross their legs?  On and on and on.  When I started with my therapist, I presented as female, wore a dress, nylons, make-up, and hair done.  Voice is still an issue, but I had to see two therapists and had my letters after the first visit..  Just some thoughts.  Sorry for the length.
yeah sounds like you need a new therapist. the most generous interpretation i give this is ""maybe explore other ways of embodying your gender before going on hormones"" but regardless that's not their business.
you shouldn't be asked or required to do anything special.

but, before i 'came out' i grew my hair out for a year.

i \*wish\* i had know to do voice training

i \*wish\* i had asked for T blockers

i \*wish\* i had done laser on my face

eh, for me that's all.  cos i didn't supress my true personality

if you did try to create a male persona, then practice just acting as yourself and not using the fake male facade.  (for people who suppress hard, dropping that fake male personality can be really hard. and does require practice)
Absolutely the wrong therapist!
Your therapist needs to stop imposing their cis idea of what a trans person should be. Period.
Gatekeepers gonna gatekeep.

Being very obvious about your transness by overcompensating is a good strategy to make sure you get what you need.

I always dress up really pretty for my HRT doctor. Full face makeup, skirts and dresses. Low cut tops and high heels. Girly voice.

When I did that for my GP, there was no question about getting my diagnosis... F64.0 and done! (Finding an endo for TG HRT in my health plan was a big problem, tho.)

I'm every situation I ask ""who do I need to be today?"" and play that character. It got me through 50 years of having to boymode, it will get me through girlmode, Rock-Star mode, TSA-mode, business mode, etc.
It could be something like the requirements my therapist has to jump through with us before she can get us on HRT. For us she’s required to see us making strides towards “living as a female” for a certain numbers of months. Things she’s said they’re looking for are things like dressing feminine, potentially makeup use, social transitioning so things like pronouns. Possibly using a female name, etc. so anytime I can whenever I go to an appointment I dress up, practice my voice, take note of interactions I have, experiences, things I’ve been doing, etc. and she’s right there with me and the others she sees, she wants to get people going immediately, but because of the circumstances she just has to wait on the clock. I think it’s a construct some dink made up a while ago to “make sure you won’t regret it”
To clarify, are you trans fem or masc ? Because I’m confused 🖐💀
There's always sewing, baking, cooking etc.

Kinda stereotypical but affirming and nearly free to do.
That is so silly. Some therapists think you need to present some traditional form of femininity to be trans, or to deserve treatment. My therapist pushes me to examine my motivations constantly. She tells me there is nothing wrong with wanting to present more feminine, or even hyper-feminine. It just isn't a necessity to being my true self.
Ugh sounds like someone who doesn't understand that you can be a butch trans woman. Maybe she just means to start your transition slowly rather than all at once so that it's less of a mental load though? Don't let anyone impose weird sexist cishet standards of gender on you though. Just be who you wanna be, and take it slow/go easy on yourself.
This is called social transitioning and a lot of therapists require it before they agree to recommending starting hrt. There are some doctors that will prescribe you without the recommendation but this can be rocky because the medicine is going to make some changes that are irreversible and you should be absolutely sure this is what you really want before seeking medical transition. If you’re afraid of ridicule and being clocked I hate to say that’s something you’re going to have to get used to. Even some of the most passing trans creators occasionally get mistaken for their assigned gender and you need to be sure you can handle that. A lot of people expect a romanticized existence of suddenly being seen as a woman/man and never going back and then when they realize the discrimination and mistreatment they occasionally have to go through from the general public they change their mind and opt to detransition. Problem is if you’ve already started hrt and been on it for months there are some changes you’re not going to be able to undo without surgery or other medical intervention. It’s really a final measure to make sure you really want to do this and can handle what comes from it more than anything.
You can have my upvote for Sailor Freddy Mercury alone lol.
You can trick your brain too huh? It's the only way I can deal with my hormone waiting list
If it was a requirement, it would be harsh, since being a girl/woman and feeling feminine are highly personal things, but I get why someone would say that you should try it. I mean, some people may say no because they don't have the body/confidence they want to, but, still, some people will like the ""overly""feminine look and other won't, like you said, you like the more ""butch lesbian"" look and drag isn't for you. It is valid.

But, trying it out is probably a important part of discovering themselves, as I like to say, ""I never ate pumpkin, I hated it, I vowed to never eat it. One day, my mom tricked me to eating it and I loved it, but I can't say the same about eggplant"" it is an analogy that I like to say because it is true and, I tried some dresses, it wasn't for me yet, but I vowed never to use earrings and I can't live without them anymore. My necklaces too, I love some feminine things, but others aren't my cup of tea and I couldn't find that out if I haven't tried it. 

And yeah, I know you probably know this, I was just saying it so my opinion is here and I try to help OP find herself.
I get that with costumes too! One of the things that happened when I was just starting to seriously question was seeing a picture of myself in LARP gear and actually liking it because I wasn’t me. I was this character.
the comment about not being dysphoric in costume…. i SO get that. i was chat noir for halloween so i was wearing a TIGHT suit. usually i go for oversized bc of my big boobs that not even a binder can conceal. i was literally just fine and not dysphoric AT ALL it was so weird
>Most people can’t just flip a switch overnight and suddenly go from being perceived 100% male to being perceived 100% female.

Even as a genderfluid person who prides themselves on being able to flip a switch and present well as another gender, it took me a long time to get to this point. Looking back on early transition photos, I looked bad and didn't pass well at all. It takes a lot of effort in changing all sorts of aspects of yourself, not just taking HRT to get results.

Essentially, it takes a lot to be cute and feminine.
That's the thing though: why is the therapist so concerned about them passing? I mean, if this is something that's come up in their therapy sessions, fair enough, but it's weird to make someone conform to binary gender just because they're trans.
Yeah, that's probably something to consider and I haven't thought sometime ago, when I did my comment. HRT does things depending on a lot of factors, so it isn't universal, as well as perceived femininity. But I've said that already, so...
Exactly. If your therapist is saying this to gatekeep a letter of support or something then booooo bad therapist. But they could also be trying to get you to explore what transition even means for you, and socially transitioning in small ways, spending time with friend or other trusted people you are out to, can be a great way to solidify your transition goals before making any permanent changes.
I will be unable to get another therapist, but i will keep it in mind whenever she says something like this again. Generally, she has been really supportive, and even when I came out, she offered to teach me how to do makeup and stuff
Sometimes is also the insurances or companies way or doing it. I made my original effort as a minor and at 14 I was told I had to socially transition for 2 years before they would work towards helping me. Shit happens, didn’t happens. Then at 17 she helped me get it set up for the day I turned 18 she submitted my letter. 

I would say to talk to her about it and find out how they do things.
I lost around 7 years because of this, it sucks.
Can you explain the issue please ? I don’t understand what’s bad about presenting as a woman before hrt.. isn’t that the whole trans thing ?
[removed]
Part of transitioning is presenting more feminine it’s called the social transition as in changing your clothes changing your style growing out your hair
And the thing is , plenty of girls will explore make up and hair etc evenings and weekends and breaks and shouldn’t need to explain 
I taught Munroe to apply face and Jodie Harsh to spin records but I struggle to dress in the morning x
I second this take. I told my therapist that it felt like my transition was stuck and she helped me brainstorm ways to keep it “moving forward”. Her big thing was that I stopped enjoying transitioning and she wanted me to have the ability to enjoy it. Sounds like this might be similar?
That's how I felt when she said it, but i'll ask about it! Thank you so much
Thats the way I took it, but the only one I know how i could do is change my voice. All the other things seem so abstract to learn
No, they’re not. Many therapists are required to have their patients show strides in change and meet certain requirements before they can prescribe treatments like HRT for them. It isn’t their fault, it’s just how they have to be. Mull over that before you jump to conclusions next time.
Funny thing, im going to my appointment now, and this is the first time i've dressed fem ever in public. I feel super wrong, but thats what the therapy is for lmao.
Trans fem
Before I identified as a girl, I thought I might be gender fluid cuz sometimes i felt some masculine and other times more feminine, and, it does take a lot. I mean, changing the looks and the way you want to be perceived. I see now that I was trying to find myself, but I felt i wronged the gender fluidity. (Sorry gender fluid gods) 

It was kinda fun at the start to go by what I felt at the moment and I still do, but, I try to get the clothes I want and plan an outfit more when it's more feminine, but it is something personal.

I also don't have a lot of confidence, so most things I try are at home alone, but that's other story. XD
I mean, if someone says they want to start HRT, as a healthcare provider I’d want the best for my patient.  Given they’re a mental health professional I’d say it’s important they encourage their clients to explore their gender beyond just HRT.

Hormones may or may not do anything for OP and there are things they can do now to work towards their transition.  I’ve seen some people post literally like 3+ years of dissatisfied transition posts and it looks like beyond just taking HRT they’ve done sweet eff all to transition.  I can imagine their therapist might be worried that OP is going to be disappointed they’re not just magic pills.
My friend didn’t present until she had spent a year on E, take your time
Let her know your gender identity isn't confined to your clothing but also how you feel and yourself as a person. That you're interested in presenting more feminine but that it's not something you feel is a priority over starting HRT and feeling more feminine. Hopefully she is just being supportive in her own way and the offer of help is honestly quite sweet. Just be aware that some therapists just aren't aware that info is outdated, and others still try to use it maliciously.

Best of luck!
I have been on estrogen for 3 years and I dont present as a woman in public yet. Dont feel pressured to do anything you dont feel comfortable doing!
i would more specifically challenge your therapist’s ideas of femininity than label them a gatekeeper who doesn’t have your best interest at heart, especially if you’re saying she has been historically supportive because I don’t think that’s what’s happening here. 

To me, it seems like she just wants you to be comfortable in the meantime before you start HRT. She might be recommending becoming more femme because she believes thats the support that you need to make you comfortable. The truth, is that taking meds alone isn’t going to change your life overnight and you should be prepared for that reality. I think what she was trying to get at with this is that you shouldn’t let not taking meds hold you back from the person you want to be. Not only that, but you shouldn’t hold yourself back because you don’t look the way you want to yet. Honestly, you may never look the exact way you want to look, i know i don’t, but that doesn’t stop me from loving myself and that’s never stopped me from dressing the way i want or doing the things i want to do.

There are definitely a lot of things you can do to “act more feminine” but more importantly you should do whatever it is you want to do and tell her that. I guess my problem with her suggestion is that it implies that there is a correct way to be feminine and that’s really not v true. You don’t need to wear pink dresses to be validated as a woman but i think you should be empowered to wear pink dresses pre-hrt if thats what you want to do and that makes you happy. if there seems to be distance between where you are happy and where she thinks you should be this is where i would push back on her archaic ideas of femininity, because at the end of the day you are a woman and thats makes everything you do feminine. god bless 💖
My story is similar except I was turned down. A male doctor said I didn't have the mannerisms he expected or carry myself as a female, so he turned me down and honestly mocked me. This was before there was an awesome online community like this and since no one I knew ever talked about being trans I just gave up. For a long time. Then someone close to me transitioned and I opened up about my story and they took it upon themselves to smash my epoxied egg with a sledgehammer and now we're married! Happy ending for the win!!! 😊
Insurance tends to have a mandatory therapy period for minors, and your individual therapist might make this a requirement to get sign off to get HRT, rather than it being something that the insurance carrier explicitly requires.

That said, you don't need letter of recommendations to start HRT for most insurance when you're 18. You can just go off and do it at an informed consent clinic. If anything, the therapist sign off for this particular step of transitioning is outdated for adults.
It's when it becomes gatekeeping and used in a hateful way that is the concern. Someone saying, ""I need you to present feminine and conform to my personal ideal of femininity before I will take your claim of being transgender serious."" is when things get bad.

Also, you don't have to present femme if you don't want to. Some people are very happy to be masc presenting women. To others, presenting femme is what's it's all about. There are no rules.
As a trans butch, I have to beg to differ.  Being forced to conform to feminine stereotypes is just as dysphoric for me as being forced to conform to masculine stereotypes.  We're not all cookie cutter clones and we all experience dysphoria differently (if at all).

The OP's own needs and the nature of her dysphoria should dictate what is actually needed.  She's not putting on a show (and the notion that trans women are putting on a show for others to gain approval is very outdated - yes, passing can be useful for safety and getting read correctly eases social dysphoria but it's about our needs in the end).

If she feels she's presenting feminine enough to ease her dysphoria, that's her call.  Dysphoria takes many forms and social dysphoria is just one of them.  Her therapist is just being a gatekeeper and raising an external bar and putting her at greater risk to block her access to HRT.
hmmm, my transmed detector is going off...
It is literally outdated, in that respected medical guidelines no longer recommend it (and in fact recommend against it).

Yes, presenting as your true gender is often an important step toward managing dysphoria, but *requiring* someone to present in a way that makes them uncomfortable or even unsafe before *allowing* them to start hormones is a well-known method of denying trans people care. It’s specifically used as a way to *not* help trans people.
social transition is about being out, not being ""more feminine""

you don't have to be a delicate pink flower princess to be a woman, tomboys are valid
It just takes time, practice, and commitment, till it becomes habit. Check out the voice stylist on YouTube. She’s got some great stuff.
[deleted]
It’ll get better :) hang in there! You’re a strong and beautiful lady!
That's probably what they're shooting for. I know theres a lot of places that are like, ""If you want to transition, prove it!"" But I would think someone who actually cares about their patient would encourage them to ""see what we can do about it *now*""
We don’t know the motivations for saying that though, nor the op’s goals nor comfort level. 

That’s a positive interpretation you gave, but I could easily see very negative ones.
I presented for a full year before starting HRT. But I do lots of things backwards… lol
Thank you! I'll talk to her about in my session later today!
Wouldn’t you have some sort of breasts by 3 years? Not disparaging, asking cause I don’t understand

Edit: having breasts meaning it would hard to hide no?
Ugh, what an absolute a-hole. People like that should not work with people. Happy everything worked out for you in the end!
Yikesssssssss
I can’t imagine having to fit some random doctors view on what a specific gender is.
I plan on doing informed consent. She was simply giving a vague recommendation from my understanding.
[removed]
For being a tomboy or being Goth is a style social transition is about being out and proud you are right what really we need to ask is for op to give us more information
I’m happy that you agree that it isn’t in the best interest of the patient, as I also believe that as well. The sad thing is the fact that so many restrictions and people that do not understand think that being trans is a choice and believe that we’re not really trans if we don’t show it, and those are the people that force these therapists to make decisions for us. It’s a cruel reality.
Who knows 🤷🏻‍♀️
Yeah lmao. I can’t present. If I wear women’s clothes I look like a drag queen and everyone is actually even more sure that I’m a man. I somehow look more manly in women’s clothes
Transmedicalist, a group of people who believe that there's only one valid way to be trans and that's to conform to gender binaries, take hormone therapy and get surgery.
Yes, you’re right. ❤️
Well, I never had the intent to pass in any kind of way. I did it in more of a punk rock fuck you kinda attitude. It’s important to make people uncomfortable. I mean not everyone has the courage (or stupidity) to make a very public statement like that.  It’s heavy and hard but I feel confident that any sacrifices I am making right now only helps the next generation! And totally worth it."	10vakx0	trans	643	1.0	2023-02-06 16:16:21
"Shop workers changed music to ""I want to break free"" after seeing me walk in."	"Just went into Zara (a clothes shop in the UK) and after getting some unusual looks from colleagues, the music suddenly changed mid-song from a typically modern playlist to ""I want to break free"" by Queen - a song which depicts all the members of Queen crossdressing.

Am I looking too much into it? Does this seem weird to anyone else?

Edit: It felt really intrusive, embarrassing, and upsetting. I was just minding my own business, feeling pretty, and while I'm trying on a dress, I'm hit with a brick of dysphoria."	"This is why I wear headphones whenever I leave the house
As a former DJ (ohh god) interrupting a song to put on a new one is a pretty big Faux-Pas.  Big swings of genre or mood or even era can also be jarring.

Now on the other hand, *I fucking love that song*.  Over here in the states that might be a little bit of a queer deep cut?  I imagine in the UK the video got a lot more play so maybe the general normie would be familiar with it?  In my experience the only people that would get that reference at all are big Queen fans themselves.  I think most people here really respect Freddy.  But again, I'm not sure how they're seen in the UK.

So there's a slight, slight chance it was meant as a positive?

I can think of a lot more hurtful songs (phobia ahoy!): >! If someone really wanted to hurt my feelings they would drop the needle on Aerosmiths boomer classic ""Dude (Looks like a Lady)"". That's kinda sweaty though, that's the go to.  A real classic rock aficionado might throw The Kinks ""Lola"" or even  The Beatles rooftop jam ""Get Back"" (Now a feature film on Disney +) . Ahh cmon, those songs are (kinda) supportive, kinda?  Maybe? Don't be so sensitive! But if you really wanted to gut punch me in the dressing room the right move would be Twain's ""Man! I feel like a woman"" Lets go girls! (to the bathroom to cry, but which?) !<
Yeah I was in a place the other day and born this way came on “randomly”.  I was like okayyyyyy this seems like a strange coincidence.
i really hope that was just a weird coincidence because wtf ??
I don’t know but who doesn’t like queen
Yeah that feels pretty weird on the part of the workers there. Like the unusual look then the music changing to that, even if it was done because they thought it was inclusive it does feel that they might be picking you out. I'd be a bit alienated if I was in your shoes.
This is my own bias talking, because I can never hate a Queen song coming on. I'd embrace it, love it, enjoy the moment of getting a Queen song playing for everyone to hear in such a public space.   
I do feel the 'am I reading too much into this' though. I recently went to a Viking fest, and there was a 'gay pirate' who had a show. He was going through the crowd, picking out individual people to make extremely sexual rhymes about (that was his whole thing, he was selling gay romance books like 'there's too many seamen on the poop-deck'). I loved it, laughing at all the rhymes he made for various people/jobs. But when he got to me, I was a 'translator'. Not the cook, or first-mate, or deck-hand, or any other job used so far. I do think I got the best rhyme for gay times...but I was still hit with instant dread over 'did he clock me? Did everyone clock me?' So I get that fear. Honestly, just try to enjoy the moment. Even if you don't like Queen, that's still a great song for others who might be closeted, might be ignorant, etc. Basically, just look on the bright side. That's what I try to do anyways. (This is also coming from a pansexual trans man, so that's why I was fine with 'being the subject of a joke', just like (hopefully) all the other guys who were singled out for the bit...since we were warned beforehand how gay it would be).
You likely didn't get any looks and it was all a coincidence.
Your feelings are valid! I wish we could feel safe trying on clothes anywhere. As to whether the song choice was intentional, I don’t know. That would require the shop workers to be very familiar with the song and the music video. I’m in the US where most transphobes or most people in general probably wouldn’t know about that cross-dressing connection to the song. That could be different in the UK, of course.
At my hrt appointment, the radio in planned parenthood played ""too late to turn back now"" and my cars TRANSmission broke and now I can't go in reverse, only forward. Is it a sign? Idk maby
I can definitely see this as a cringey ally thing to do. I bet they were trying to be supportive and encouraging—but by noticing you and making a thing out of it, they accidentally made you feel uncomfortable. I’m sorry that happened to you! Just try to assume that it wasn’t bigotry on their part, but rather a clumsy, failed attempt at cheering you on.
🤷‍♀️
maybe they were trying to be supportive by playing what they thought as a queer anthem.

they were not very successful, but they tried.
This is definitely weird and not funny.
Like, encouragement? Or like, bigotry?

Because I can't imagine that not being an ally thing to do.
That’s normally the first song on lots of pride playlists, are you sure they were staring at you in a bad way and not just like “are they? Should we?”
I wouldn't be all that surprised if it was a transphobe, but I also would not be surprised if it was a really really bad attempt at allyship, it being random is the only thing that would surprise me. Doesn't make it any less shitty either way.
If that's the case tune out their hate and insecurities they're projecting on to you and enjoy the music.

It's like whatever anyone's doing or choosing there will always be atleast someone who has a problem with it. So it's better to tune out such people's words and actions (not always but you get the point).

Life's a party just dance and enjoy. Plus it's ok to ""accidentally"" hit someone while dancing too ig.
I mean it’s more of them being Drag Queens or just understanding clothes and stuff don’t have gender assigned to them
This was almost certainly a coincidence 

That is not how transphobia manifests lol
I don’t think the shop workers would stop what they’re doing to change the music to Queen, for the purposes of upsetting a customer. Retail sucks. People don’t care that much to ruin your day. I’m a trans woman and never even thought of that song as something hateful or offensive, even. 

I think you’re reading way too into this. Plenty of retail workers change the music or playlist mid-song. This happens a lot. Sometimes the playlist sucks and they want something more uplifting. Sometimes the current playlist or station is getting stale and they want something fresh. 

Whatever it is, I think you’re reading way too deep into this and I don’t think it’s that serious or about you.
Ya, This could be just friendly hazing. Im not sure without further context. My friends would likely do this crap to me. But if they did I know it comes from a playful, ""we accept you as one of us"" kind of place. I'd embrace it. Hopefully your situation is just as benign as my hypothetical one. <3
it’s actually a very affirming song
IMO, you should own it. ""Cheers guys n gals is this one for me?...I'm flattered!"" {now do a twirl}
awwwwww
Ngl that’s pretty nice lol
this doesn’t feel targeted, it’s genuinely a popular song. i’m sorry you feel that way OP, your post history suggests that you did suffer from actual targeted transphobia. feel better ❤️
Honestly I would have just went with it and slayed a runway In front of them 🤷🏻‍♀️. Like, thank you to my fans for giving me a beat? They thought they really did something didn't they?
First : It IS weird, if it's a coincidence it's very bizare.

Second : I suffer from social anxiety, I tho have those creepy remark I heard from people in the streets, but for me, just talking for myself, it's me who paranoid 90% of the time.

So I would say. Don't mind it too much, you still have a thin probability they are just queen fan (which is good, they like a gay star, not typical of homophobe/transphobe)

But stay vigilant.

Good luck.
If this happened to me I don’t think I would even react to it, had no idea that the song depicted crossdressing.
If it was on purpose because directed at you, that’s wholly inappropriate. (I do love that song though and Freddy was one of my heroes growing up in the 80s) I hope you have the type of day that makes you feel your best self!
The biggest mistake you can ever make is to hand me a microphone. I would have played it for everything it's worth. I'm such a bitch.
I got a retro style audio cassette player for Christmas (Walkman) and ironically enoughmy favorite tape is the soundtrack for Bohemian Rhapsody the movie that I play as I walk around town. I hear nothing if I don’t want to lol. 

Honestly it may just be a coincidence but if it wasn’t I’d say you’re simply dealing with some infantile jerks that aren’t really worth paying any attention to.
This sounds targeted. But could be two ways. Depending on your relationship with your colleagues there, it could be seen as good or bad.  Supportive or transphobic. Context here matters more than the song here
I love Queen and I'm cis and straight.  I love The Bitch is Back by Elton John too. Girl just claim it an go with it.
It wouldn’t have been aimed. Personally I think that’s a great song. Be strong
I love that song, I just couldn't complain...
I would do this but I feel like I need to listen closely to my surroundings to stay safe
Same I'm always wearing headphones even when I turn them off and sleep there next to the bed there on rn
What headphones you got
Omg same here
I used to but my headphones stopped working

Yeah, Lola was relatively supportive in its time but it aged really poorly. I guess that's the nature of things, we interpret classics through the lens of our reality. The first time I heard it I was like ""WTF is this"" but after reading a bit about the history it kind of grew on me, depending on which way you interpret a single line.
Wait, is there something bad with I want to break free? I haven’t seen the music video or anything, just curious.
AccidentalAlly moment? Because you *were* born this way.
This is exactly what I mean. Thank you! 🙏 I don't care how positive they thought it was, they're picking me out. In another scenario, it'd be so rude to put on a particular song you thought was appropriate just because you saw a person of colour enter the shop - even if your intentions are positive and you think they might like it.
This is my new favorite comment.
Yeah, really not the place, this isn't the TGCJ.
Be it encouragement or bigotry, it's not an ally thing to do because it's picking someone out of the crowd because they look visibly trans without knowing whether they want to be seen
I respect that other people might like that, but I certainly didn't. It felt horrible. 😓
Best way to stay safe is to look like too much trouble for them. Always look like you're ready to fight and they tend to leave you alone. People who prey on others don't want a fight, they want you to cower. If they think you're gonna make noise or fight back they'll USUALLY leave you alone.
yea i feel the same way but in some situations i feel fine wearing them :/
If you have Apple Watch+AirPods you can pause the music your playing or even turn on hearing amplifier.
I bought a cheap pair of ""hidden"" earphones that I use for work and I always only ever have one ear piece in and nobody even knows (I have longer hair) so I do it that way when I leave the house sometimes.
Which is why I often wear headphones but don't have music on. So I can ignore people and situations and they assume I just can't hear them, well at the same time I can observe what's happening around me.

Bose QC35 here. Served me well for six years and still going very strong. Best money I've ever spent on anything.
I’m also autistic so it’s for both reasons but yeah if I can’t hear you it’s all good
I still really like Lola; the wording and things aren't great but the overall message of it is what I think is more important. Dude looks like a lady is still...oof but from my understanding is more about how the band was criticised for their long hair and makeup
I think it's great! But that's what I mean, I feel like most people in the states have never seen the video. But OP mentioned she's in the UK, so I'm not sure how it was culturally over there. 

Personally trying to shame me with Queen is like putting out fire with gasoline.
That’s what born this way is about
As someone that’s worked in retail in the UK, employees generally don’t have control over what music they play in-store - particularly with large chains/corporations. It normally comes down from head office and they just turn it on at the beginning of the day. So if it makes you feel any better it was likely an unfortunate coincidence!
Ouch… i’m sure they meant to play it to be nice tbh…
I’m a skinny short boy but I’m pretty muscular and I can definitely throw a punch . I look *very* trans but have only had guys try and hurt me once and I just ran

The song is more about hair metal (Motley Crue, in particular, apparently,), and the fact that it was a lot more gender non-conforming.
I just open carry a Glock, no transphobe is willing to die over it.
I have an axe in my bag, usually wear composite toe shoes, and hold my keys ready to swing. I also charge in and out of buildings.
Maybe…they are wireless
Ah well I take back that I said they were shit in that case
Yes, Aerosmith were at a bar with Mötley Crüe and were being typical boys doing stupid stuff that they think is funny when they got the idea for the song. Said “stupid stuff” is that they were repeatedly calling each other *dude*. At one point, somebody mistook a member of Mötley Crüe as a woman from behind due to the guy’s long hair. Thus, dude looks like a lady. The song was actually very progressive for the time since it’s literally about gay sex.

I love Aerosmith to death, and Steven Tyler is notoriously progressive. He’s always aimed to be a lot more androgynous in the way he dresses, and has been vocally anti-Tr*mp.
I would but I don’t got papers for mine and I’d rather not attract police attention
I just lead a Swiss mercenary band in classic pike and shot infantry tactical formation wherever I go, and carry mace in my pocket just in case I'm outnumbered or do not have a tactical advantage due to being downhill and outranged.

I Cut off my Mom	"Hi. This is long. I just needed to get it out.

A little background, my mother and I have always been close. We rarely went 2 weeks without talking. I've lived all over the world, and we have always kept in touch regularly. When she comes to visit (she's out of state), she stays with me. She visited in late April 2022...

She's the first person I came out to, end of April 2022. I cried and asked if she would still love me if I was a man. She cried and said ""I see your soul, I will always love you."" I hadn't come to accept that I was a trans man yet, I thought maybe NB? I started to explore my transition options (binder, haircut, masc nickname). We still talked regularly.

FF to end of May. I'm shopping for clothes and not having a great time. Called my mom for support, she says, ""you could just be a woman with short hair and men's pants."" All I could think was, No, I cant. I'm not a woman. If I needed another ah-ha moment... there it was.

We stopped talking as much, definitely didn't talk about my transition bc she seemed uncomfortable with it. She did say that if I tell anyone, I should tell them in person, its respectful.

Beginning of July, I call her. She's a couple states away so in person isn't really viable, so video chat instead. I tell her, I'm a trans man. I go by Davis. I use he/him pronouns. She cries. Says it will be an adjustment, but she loves me and wants to be supportive. In the same conversation my step dad walks in, asks who she's talking to... I get deadnamed and misgendered. She didn't even attempt to explain that I have a new name.

Throughout July, I come out to my family. My brothers and my father. Two brothers are fine, then one refuses to acknowledge it at all. Not denial but refusal. I cut him out of my life. He called our mom. Mom called me. We had a huge argument. It ended with her needing time to 'mourn her daughter'. And I figured I'd just give her space.

I told my dad 2 days later. He was surprisingly ok? Like he doesn't agree, but he'd rather have a relationship with me this way than no relationship. To him, I ""used to be his daughter but thinks he's a guy now"" (quoting my sister in law from a conversation yesterday). And considering my very conservative father... I'll take it. He at least gets my name and pronouns right. Yes, its a very low bar.

I was surprised my mother didn't call me to see how it went with my dad (dad and I have never had a great relationship), but figured she's still upset so let it go.

4 weeks and 1 day from our argument, she contacts me.

She said my dad has been trying to call me all month but I keep blocking his calls. (aside: I'm not blocking his calls, I talked to him, he has 2 numbers stored for me and keeps calling the wrong one.. I've had the same number for 8 years). And she says that she was afraid to contact me because my dad having blocked calls must mean that I've blocked everyone. And here's the run down of her discussion with my dad:

Dad: deadname blocks my calls

Mom: I don't know why she would do that

Me listening to this from her: I don't know why \*she\* would do that either... I thought \*she\* was dead, since you are mourning \*her\*.

Mom: what?

Me: You are mourning \*her\*, you said so. I'm not sure how a dead person is blocking calls.

Mom: I'm talking about you!

Me: I get that, but I'm a guy.

Mom: You are a woman.

Me: Ok, <moms legal first name here>

Mom: Don't disrespect me like that! I am your mother!

Me: Don't disrespect me like that! I am a man!

Mom: You cant make me change my core beliefs!

Me: I wish you a happy life Mrs. <moms legal last name here>.

Then I hung up.

\---

So TLDR: She said she will always mourn her daughter. And that I am a woman and cannot change that and cannot change her core beliefs. She said its disrespectful to try to force this on her and change her beliefs. I'm guessing she doesn't see the irony that she's disrespecting me at every turn.

I was wondering, AITA? But I don't think I care anymore, I'm mostly I'm just tired of her shit.

Edited for formatting."	"This triggered something within me because I recently came out as trans and have had similar experiences with my family. I am so sorry that you are going through this, it is never easy to cut off someone, especially immediate family. 

I want to tell you that I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries. You did the right thing, and even though it's difficult, please stand in your strength. You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother. If she cannot respect you and your identity, she does not need to be in your life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who accept you for who you are. Lots of love from a fellow trans 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
You're not the AH here. I had to cut of my so called ""father"", but more a lack of question. Kinda similar like what you told. He just refused to use my proper name and she/her. We haven't talked in soon 5 years.

VERY much on your side in this. Our sides in this.
Fucking hell. Somewhere along the line she forgot you weren't her property.
I don't think you're an AH. You didn't ask her to completely come around. You gave everyone leniency and patience. And even those not accepting you, you continued to give time and space so they might eventually fully come around. Your boundary is that they have to at least try to respect you. And your mother refused that. So you cut her off.   

I came out to my dad 7 weeks ago. I asked him to start using my name and pronouns about 3 weeks ago. He hasn't yet. But he's getting a therapist to work through all of this. He keeps telling me ""I'm not ok with this."" And it sucks because he and I were close. But I always knew he was transphobic, though he of course didn't think he was. And if he doesn't come around in the next few weeks, I'll be cutting him off as well.  

I'm out to almost everyone in my life now and I'm not going to spend time with people who won't respect me for who I am. I don't care what their excuses are. By not using my name or pronouns, you're reminding me of how I was born. Something I can't control, but something that hurts to think about. I need to move forward and I need to be the woman I should have been born as. And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.  

Being trans is hard enough without people being casual bigots around us.
You’re not the a**hole here. You can’t choose how they handle their stuff, but that doesn’t mean you have to just sit there and take the bull. I went through something similar with my mom a few weeks ago. They’re going to be in pain because we’re setting the boundaries we need, but there’s nothing to do except violate our own boundaries and mental health for them. Honestly kudos to you for being able to tell them that stuff over the phone 😂 I literally couldn’t and had to mail them a letter telling them I’d only talk to them on mail for now.
You must find the courage to leave the table
If respect is no longer being served

—Tene Edwards


I’m proud of you.
Very similar to how it went with my mom, apart from the last bit where she fully denied that you're a man and refused to change her core beliefs. But I did recently hear from my older brother (who accepts me completely), that our mom had said to him something along the lines of ""no wonder he's having mental health issues with the stuff (testosterone) he's he's putting in his body."" The mental health issues are completely unrelated to my transition and are something I've struggled with for years, even before I knew I was trans, and additionally tried to get help for in high school, but my mom kept me from seeing a therapist.

Suffice to say, it added to the pile of reasons to cease contact with her. I don't think I've fully decided and/or committed to it, but it's been well over a month since I last talked to her and whenever I think of calling I'm none too eager.

Good on you for making that call for yourself. Plenty of people will tell you that it was the wrong choice or that they would have done differently or that you should forgive her, but ultimately it's your life and you should not sacrifice your happiness for the sake of someone who does not respect you. If you feel your life would be better without her in it, then you made the right choice.
I cut my mother (and soon it’ll be all my family) out of my life completely years ago and I have no regrets, nobody should have to put up with being belittled, abused or whatever it is just because you share some stupid dna. I personally have much less anxiety and shit to worry about now and nothing will make me go back.
Fuck im sorry you had to deal with that. Its never good whenever either parents that aren't supportive. Whenever I came out to my mom she told my dad and then did nothing to help me. They didn't try to call me by the name i felt more comfortable with or gender me correctly. They wanted to act like I never said it
You have been patient and reasonable.

If people won't accept who you are and are happy to cause you pain and suffering in the process, cutting them out of your life is a completely valid way of dealing with that.

Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe they won't. You have to do what's right for you.

You don't know me, but I'm proud of you for standing strong.
i don't have much to add, but it was kind of jarring seeing your name because it was my deadname lmao. never met anyone else with it, its fun :)
‘Mourn her daughter?’ Huge red flag already just from that eesh. I hate people like that
Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning. It sounds like they have been pushed through their own transitions faster than they can either individually or collectively cope with. A month or so is just not remotely enough time. Hell, a couple of years at least is needed. Sadly, it sounds like these relationships have broken down badly.

For what it's worth, even giving family years doesn't ensure a better outcome. I was estranged from my father right up to his death and I'm now estranged from the rest of my family too. So happy endings are not the norm or even common.

Wishing you peace of mind with your decision to transition. That's the best you can hope for. Hugs.
>You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother.

Thank you. <3
🤣
>And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.

I keep being told that I'm choosing this. I'm choosing to be trans. I'm choosing this and making everyone else get in line or get out. \*sigh\*. 

Like, I didn't choose to be trans. I chose to start living as my true self, and you know BE HAPPY.

Good luck with your dad. I'm glad he's seeing someone. Its hard for us and its hard for them.
Yeah, I'm transitioning quickly. But I shouldn't have to sit thru purposeful disrespect just so they can have more time. I get that it's a change... but I'm being told they won't change at all and I don't see a reason to keep someone like that in my life. If in the future they can remember it's He not She, my door is always open.
""Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning.""

Not in my experience. My brother, who I fully expected to react badly, just started crying and apologising for all the hurtful things he probably said to me growing up. Five minutes later I was his sister who he would love, support and defend.

So the whole family requiring extra time because they are family is just bullshit. You're either accepting and love someone unconditionally or you aren't and would rather guard your own insecurities than support someone who really needs you.
I would even argue ""especially"" your mother. Sending you lots of love ❤️
Thanks.   

Yeah, I see the same situation constantly. Even those who support me often think I'm ""choosing"" something. Like, I'm really not. I'm just trying to be myself without extra stress and anxiety. It must be nice being totally comfortable in your own skin and having the right hormones coursing through your body. But I don't get that luxury. So I have to medically intervene.  

If legitimate medical treatment upsets you, then maybe you shouldn't have that pacemaker or that tumor removed? Maybe you shouldn't be on depression or anti-anxiety meds and take your chances with your blood pressure?  

I'm not ""making"" anyone do anything. I'm *asking* for the people who claim to love me to just respect me. Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss *you* off. Like, what a selfish thought pattern.
Remember to keep reiterating that to them... It's important. But you also need to give them a reason to want to make the transition too. No one accepts unwanted change willingly. After about 7 years I was able to talk with my mother again. My entire family blanked me for years after my transition. Unfortunately, the superficial vaneer she had painted over who I really am wasn't enough for me and the relationship subsequently broken down when I got married because she wouldn't attend my marriage. Same went for the rest of my family. Not a single family member attended my wedding. Zoe and I have been together since 2006 and married for the last 5 of those years. Yet my family can't accept who I really am even though I transitioned in 2003. That's a long, long time to accept who I am if they gave a shit. My point is, it's a tough road to walk and there just may not be enough between you and your family to pull you together again. I hope there is though because it's a cold stone in your heart if it isn't.
If you are in a supportive family... That is truly awesome for you! Sadly, the statistics put that as exceptional rather than the norm. Perhaps do some background research on family integration of transitioning family members.

Books like [this](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003001881-10/transitioning-families-butch-losey) for example.

Supportive families are becoming more 'common' but family transitions are still very much a thing. Typically with rejection of the transitioning family member so that the family unit can retain its world views.
>Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss you off.

Yep. In hindsight, I think my mom saying I should tell everyone in person, was almost a dare. Like, OH, they wont really do this. They wont REALLY tell their dad. And then I did. And I started on T.

I told her about T, she didn't ask about how it would affect me, she asks, have you had any side effects yet? Like, wtf? I'm thinking she might have read that terf book about FtMs.

Like if someone is getting medical treatment, you ask, how are you feeling? not, any side effects yet?
>give them a reason to want to make the transition too.

How about, they love me?
But I’m not in a supportive family. I will likely never speak to my parents again. My point was that whether or not a relationship is familial has no relevance for how long they need to adapt. 

People either love and accept us unconditionally or they don’t - its that simple.

I also don’t require education on transitioning and family. I have lived it thanks.
My dad has yet to ask me if I'm happy. If I feel better. How the transition is going. It's just about how he can't accept it and can't call me his daughter and is worried what his parents will think.  

Luckily, he's pretty much alone so far. Him and his parents are likely to be the only ones in my life who aren't supportive. His wife (my stepmom), my sister, the rest of the family, my wife and her family, and all of my friends fully support me. So he can sit in a corner and mope alone when the holidays roll around I guess.
Yeah, if people 'actually' had unconditional love in the first place that would be a given. The truth is sadly, that unconditional love really means that you continue to live within the social framework that they live by. Transitioning throws that out of the window, so in their eyes, you broke the unwritten clauses in that 'unconditional love' contract. Also, very few parents and siblings actually do love unconditionally, even by their own terms of reference! Mostly, it's a veneer of convenience... Make of that what you will.
Then I can only wish the best for the future!
They really do think that we just drop a nuke into the center of our lives, for funsies. For the lolz. Because we were bored on a Tuesday. 

Wake up. Make Coffee. Be trans just to piss everyone off. LOL!
I prefer to be trans BEFORE my coffee bc then I'm extra moody about it.
I told my partner that coffee makes me less stabby. He was like, you're not functional before coffee (ie you cant be stabby). I was like, ok, it makes me more stabby? hahahahahaaaaaaaa!"	wo923r	trans	638	0.98	2022-08-14 15:30:24
Vintage Clothes are the BEST!! ✨ I recommend checking out your local thrift stores and antique stores for some really pretty outfits! 😊💕		"I love all of it!

I went to a vintage shop and bought a skirt and a cardigan but unfortunately I came out looking like a granny.
Oh wow I LOVE that denim skirt!

You look so freaking precious in that outfit!

So, I see a post like this and I think ""Wow! I wanna say something positive."" And because you're into the 80's I think ""Well, I grew up in the 80's, I'll try to make some comparison to a gal from back then"" but you kinda got your own thing going on. I like to think I'm forward-looking and don't care to spend much time in the past, but you're making the 80's thing really it work for you!

Terrified of going into a women's clothes store... But this sounds way less intimidating. I had never considered it. Thank you ! You look amazing !
I saw your timeline the other day, you look absolutely fab, definitely an outfit you rock!
This outfit is so cute!! Looks like vintage pics of my mom and her friends when she was young.

Is there a website or app where I can donate my feminine clothes to a trans woman?	"I'm a trans man and I have a lot of nice clothing from when I was a woman. I would love to help out a fellow trans person.. Maybe someone who just transitioned needs some clothes ya know? 


Is there an app for that? Lol

Edit: I'm 'petite' (ugh lol) so clothing sizes are XS-M .. pants are size small or 3-4..

I do not have FB"	"You could reach out to a local LGBTQ+ group or a shelter that specializes help LGBTQ+ youths
I wish I have so much of my old mens clothes. Wanna swap? Lol a lot of it went to my brother but I have some good pieces left.
You know, a website for that would be a great idea, gotta think on the logistics behind it tho
A website for a clothing swap? Trans men and women could benefit. What a fabulous idea!
I wish.
God this would be a genius idea. I have many dresses, skirts, girly clothes, jewelry and heels I'm not sure what to do with. Wether it be taking them to the thrift shop, selling or what. 

Would love to just find a transwoman close in size and just be like ""You have boy clothes.. I have girl clothes...swap?"" And call it a day.
Not as far as I know, but thanks for the great idea to build one. Greetings from your typical trans girl programmer
Holy genius batman that's brilliant and if ur looking to donate and help a fellow trans woman depending on the size I'd appreciate if you'd send them my way
I dont think so, but there absolutely *needs* to be an app for this! Genius idea!
Thred Up will take it idk if there is a way for you to specify who it goes to though vut you get credit for donating stuff and they send you prepaid shipping boxes
Depop maybe
Wow, I wish I would’ve thought to do something like this when I came out, roughly 11 years ago. Would’ve been amazing to do a clothing swap of sorts. We should make a group somewhere so people can do that.
I have no idea but I love your idea and your heart is in the right place. ❤️
I have so much boy clothes that I wanna get rid of. Don’t want to donate it to some religious org. to profit off of, would rather it goes to a trans masc individual if possible.
Someone needs to make an app for this!
It’s called Reddit.com and I’m right here! Hehe jk…
Look into Local clothes swaps !
r/transtrade is small but it does exist!
I had a friend that ran a homeless shelter. She didn't want my casual guy clothes but was definitely interested in my business clothes.

Anything professional is needed to help people interview and land jobs.

Thanks for thinking of donating!
I’m tiny and want them 😂
I tried calling a few LGBTQ centers in my area and none of them will take clothing. They only want specific things like winter coats, hats, etc. Maybe there are websites or Facebook groups that promote trans clothing trading?
my school actually did a clothing drive for trans kids cuz there were so many of us there. it was really sweet
Never heard of a site for that, but I did trade basically all my masc clothes with an enby friend for their old clothes so it does work like that
You’re a real sweetheart, y‘know :3
Look around your local community groups which often run trans clothes swaps with the added benefit of not having to sort out delivery etc
In Sacramento there is a queer free market Facebook group where people donate all types of things including clothes and you can specify who they will be chosen to go to. There may be one in your area! Hope this helps 😊
I'd check Facebook to find local trans groups or lgbt charities. Lots of them do meetups and swaps
You're a good person,  God bless 🙏
Your local LGBTQ community centers will host clothing swaps from time to time
I just do it by word of mouth, I have offered up to one friend, who is picking through stuff, but then I have a second and third who will get the next picks
Look for a local clothing swap, I attended one last month. It was sweet but, be prepared to change in front of others
Idk if there is an app or website, but now I want to make one
Face book groups
I know a bunch of places in the Netherlands. I suppose it depends a lot on where you live
[deleted]
Me! Me! I'll take them lol
I’m detransitioning  back to living as male and have clothes and shoes I would like to donate
r/transtrade
This is such an awesome idea!
Trans clothing swap is the best idea ever.

That being said, most trans women will likely not fit that. I'm sure someone will but they are the ones who already dont have a hard time finding fem clothes that fit
I’m open to donations lmao
me.

jkjk i can buy myself clothes, but i appreciate the thought :) i'd love to donate my clothes (if i didnt need them to hide my feminine clothes)
[TransCrowdFund](http://tcfcf.org)
A local LGBTQ+support group had a donation closet for people who needed new clothes.  That was where I donated mine.
Seconding this, every lgbt center in every city I’ve ever lived in has a clothing program for trans people.
That's a good idea, I found a youth shelter that emphasizes safe homes for LGBTQ+ kids and sent them an email. Thanks 😊
Check out r/transtrade!
Um yes! Ha what size are you ? 😁
Someone who knows anything about how to invent apps needs to do this asap. Such a good idea!
There is a Facebook group… I can DM you a link if you want.
r/transtrade also exists although it is small!
Pure genious
Seriously. When I started questioning seriously I just boxed up 90% of my girl clothes (kept the fairly unisex stuff and bought some mens clothes to fill the gaps) and stored them in the basement so I could still change my mind and go back to femme but it’s been a year and a half and I have NO desire to dig those clothes out for myself again and am now feeling pretty damn solid about being a guy, so it’s probably donate time.
As a fellow trans girl it student I'm down to help in the future  -Lynn <3
see if r/transtrade would work for you!
I live in a pretty conservative area and unfortunately I'm the only trans person I know 🤷‍♂️
thank you for this!! even though it’s a small community i hope it grows and i’m able to do a swap!
I'm good on clothes I'm SOOO picky, not doubting your style lol but I have old mens medium tops and between 32/30 and 34/30 pants if you want them lol I do wish we had a trans resource to donate them. Changing a wardrobe is EXPENSIVE but being a lesbian and my partner is almost the same size as me makes it a bit easier 😜
I'm thinking about it, just the logistics to make it work are a little bit elusive, how to ensure safety, how to ensure some people dont just get everything, delivery methods, etc.
Could you DM me a link to this as well?
Sorry for the Necro, but could you DM that link to me as well? I have a ton of Masc clothes that I'd like to donate.
Hello fellow trans girls who does stuff on computers, let me know if you’d need a logo or anything else similar for the site if made. ❤️
I'll keep it in mind
Thanks for pointing me in that direction! I’ll have to go through the stuff I have and post a lot or something. Most of my boy clothes are eh but if it helps someone then that’s good enough for me.

Edit: maybe lot isn’t the right word but a listing? Idk not charging or anything not sure what the term would be.
Could use the same business plan as Mercari as a base platform for the logistics. I wouldn’t EVER do a meet up situation for delivery for safety reasons
r/transtrade also exists but is small!
DMing you now !
I'm currently working with neko I'll definitely hit you up if needed at the moment we are just wireframing the interface
Me too!
Oh dope! I’m completely free when ever you need, just finished up school and I’m taking a break from like every atm trying to not burn out. I’m happy to help in any way. ❤️🤘
Good shit you guys!"	z6v3q8	trans	628	0.99	2022-11-28 12:19:08
Can gender dysphoria manifest in apathy?	My whole life I’ve just been very apathetic about myself. I never bothered finding clothes I really liked because I knew I wouldn’t like myself in them. Something just felt so gross, so disconnected. I never put effort into my appearance because I knew that, for reasons I couldn’t pinpoint, I would never look good. I realized I might be trans because of gender euphoria, and I assumed I was non-dysphoric, that gender dysphoria was just something I’d never gotten. Looking back though I’m wondering if maybe I did experience dysphoria in the form of that weird, uncomfortable feeling I had growing up? Is that a thing, or am I grasping at straws?	"Yes, absolutely it can! That's why ""denial beards"" are so common for MtF's. We just...don't care. Our male bodies are gross and boring.   

I didn't start to truly care about my body until I realized I was trans. And then I started losing weight, shaving, using face creams and skin care products, etc.  

Totally apathetic about myself prior to it all.
Absolutely yes. One of my clues was realizing my wardrobe consisted of three pairs of jeans and a couple dozen t-shirts, cause it's an easy outfit and I never put much thought into how I dress.

I also reverted to the comfortable option in nearly every life decision - finally I'm working to improve my life now that I realize who I am.
I felt the same way myself. My wardrobe consisted of years-old worn out clothes I got as gifts- never bothered to shop for myself until something was completely falling to pieces, never tried to develop any sort of style. I just threw on whatever was at hand.

Even worse, I went through a few long periods where I didn't exercise, or shave, or shower, or even brush my teeth regularly because I just *could not care* about my body. After coming out I've finally started taking care of myself again. I don't know if I'll be able to make up for all those years of neglect but I'm finally motivated to try.
The words gross and disconnected and uncomfortable could be about dysphoria.

I chased euphoria and have tried many things.I needed them all. But now being without any of them again I become so desperate again AS I WAS BEFORE! That's when I understand it was not depression for past 30 years.
100% you are hitting the nail on the head. For the longest time I didn't care about my health I didn't care about my job I didn't care about my education that much. I didn't really care about how I looked. However at least two or three times a day I would just wish that I could start over life as a girl. Once I accepted that I was trans that all went away and suddenly I did care about how I looked I wanted to get into the gym I didn't want to smoke anymore I didn't want to do anything I wanted to care about my body because I was about to craft my body into what I dreamed it could be
This is very similar to my experience honestly so, I definitely think its possible!
Nah, you're not grasping at straws and this is super common, especially among people who only find out they're trans in their twenties or later.

At 23 I was still wearing hoodies my mom had bought for me in high-school because I just couldn't bring myself to care about my appearance past not wanting to stand out negatively. 

To me my egg-cracking was definitely accompanied by a very strong realization of ""Wait, it's actually kind of fucked up how little I care about everything and now that I do care, holy shit, wtf am I doing with my life?!?""
i think yes, you experienced gender dysphoria but not in the typical way, but i have also experienced it like yours, you see clothes you like but wasn’t bothered because u felt u wouldn’t look good in them, knowing it would make u dysphoric if u bought them and u didn’t feel as if u passed or looked good in them
I started dressing nice and working out once I came out. It was like suddenly my body was worth living in and taking care of if it meant getting closer to feeling right
Totally.
I now realize before realizing I was trans I was never ever content with the way I looked even when getting dressed up. It was always “just ok” and such. If u saw myself in the mirror it was “terrible” or “ok”.
Now I actually get happy seeing how handsome I look, I sometimes even feel like damn narcissus since I love the person I see in the mirror lol
It can, and I have personal experience ongoing with that effect.

I can't care enough to buy clothes, because I won't like how they look in my body. My sister herself also told me ""Your room is depressing, it looks dead."" 

Whenever customization options are given to me, I never use them. There's a day when you can wear whatever in school? Guess who is walking in uniform regardless?
God this was me exactly. Coming out was amazing like, oh shit I'm finally able to give a fuck about my appearance and hygiene etc because there is an ideal I can actually imagine attaining. The egg apathy is real and it suuuuucked.
i mean have you tried experimenting a little bit? i didnt realize i was trans until a group of girls held me down and put makeup and a dress on me. I thought i hated it then looked in a mirror
Mm hmm. I never liked shopping. Some of the clothes I'd wear regularly I'd had for 20+ years. I'd have 3 pairs of the same jeans and if they ever wore out if just buy a new exact pair to replace it with. I bragged about how little I spent on clothes. Clothing was just a way to cover my body and blend in. Nothing more nothing less.
oh my god reading the replies have made me realise some things wow
It is like you are describing my issues exactly.

My dysphoria was like a deep rooted indifference to myself.i neglected my health until I weighed 305 lbs.

I have since found so much euphoria in the progress I have made this year. I am on HRT and I have lost 65 lbs.

I love my skin and my growing lips and how I don't stink any longer.

Figuring out who I was is the best thing to ever happen to me.
Can totally relate! I always had my hair in a lazy ponytail, maybe a braid or something and whenever I found nice clothes I'd like how *the clothes* looked rather than how *I* looked in the clothes. 

Had my sister cut my hair down from about shoulder length to how youtuber Jammiedodger (also a trans man) has his and now I like how it looks *on me.* I'm wearing shirts in bold print because I like them and how they look *on me.* It feels so much better.
Holy poop lol this is totally me and didn't realize it till your post lol
I think it’s definitely a thing. I struggle with just existing and doing anything. I’m a brand new pre-everything trans guy. 

For most of my life I have been a caretaker and neglecting myself and my needs. I just didn’t have the energy or whatever you wanna call it. I have struggled with depression and anxiety for ages. I struggle with my weight, I forget to eat, I wear the same outfit more than once. My wardrobe is basically the same outfit x6… and a few pajamas that I basically live in…
I have makeup that I want to wear, and when I do wear it, I feel better for a while. But then I go back to feeling like I’m slogging through mud every single hour of every day. Apathy is real.

I’m actually feeling a bit better now that I know why I have been feeling this way for so long. I don’t even remember what finally shattered the boulder that had been crushing me without my even knowing it was there. I feel lighter, happier and I feel a sense of peace. However, I’m also dealing with fear and anxiety over coming out to my family, transitioning and the now almost insurmountable fear of not finding a partner because of my body not being cis.

I’m actually going to be seeking therapy, with a therapist who specializes on working with trans people, so that I can deal with and process my feelings and issues.

But! I’m feeling optimistic about my future too.

Good luck and stay safe! I love all of you, my sibs from other cribs!
Peace! Luc
It definitely has in the past for me! For much of my college career I could not be bothered to wear anything but sweatpants and what I now know to be a dysphoria hoodie lmfao
Same here actually. I don't care much for my style or anything. It's just boring and my body feels like a tool for everyday life anyway so why bother? The only exception is my hair. Im growing it out, i think you can guess why, so i like to take care of it to have it soft and healthy looking. But when i think about female clothing oh god. There are so many combinations and everything. Really wanna try stuff out and find a cool and beautiful style. Well one day I hope...
What you are calling apathy may be dissociation/depersonalisation and yes it very much can be a type of dysphoria - this article really helped when I was questioning: https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/
Definitely a thing. 
Definitely my experience. I was not engaged with myself. Now that I'm transitioning I get to discover my body for the first time since the wrong puberty started.
Welcome to what I had for 33 years! Complete apathy towards my appearance and zero desire for maintenance work like the dentist.
yes! i personally had this happen too!
Yes. That's what I had.
Yes it can. That’s how it manifested for me but it was apathy in everything not just my appearance. I never cared about the clothes I wore or how I looked. I always just felt I would always be disgusting because that’s how I felt being a boy. I didn’t realize this until a day that I accomplished a huge goal of mine and instead of feeling happy or even sad, I felt nothing. No emotion. I was just there. That’s when I had to ask myself why and began unraveling my true feelings instead of ignoring them. I never felt the “typical” dysphoria because I just ignored it and developed apathy as a coping mechanism. It could be very likely that you’ve also done the same
Yes
I was pretty similar pre-discovery; basically just no feelings.
Dissociative Gender Dysphoria is something I learnt about a couple of months ago. I remember experiencing it a lot and never wanting to think about or connect with my body. This post sounds a bit like the thoughts I was having during that time. 
To answer your post, I definitely think you are having gender dysphoria of sorts
This thread is making me learn so much about myself!

I never went to the dentist, never flossed, only got a haircut when absolutely necessary, wore same bland shoes everyday, two pairs of the same jeans, never got excited about buying clothes, I could go on..
I’m so glad you asked! I totally relate to a lot of these
Yes i explained it to my therapist as, I'm playing a video game, I am making the choices but the ""character"" is not me I didn't get to chose the character and the default settings doesn't match me. I'm looking at someone else's life. (I do have a bit of actual dysphoria) but mostly i just exist and don't get exited over my life.
That’s how it was for me. I got very numb and dissociative around the 6th grade when all the kids split in to boys and girls. It wasn’t until I was about 20 I even came across the possibility of being trans. After a few months of hormones I finally started to be able to feel present and learn to connect with the world around me.
Some of these can be depersonalization-derealization symptoms, it's a kind of dissociation that some trans people have before they transition and it can take the form of not being able to envision or care about a future for yourself. It can feel like a lack of purpose or meaning, as in you can consider these things but you don't feel them resonate for you or motivate you at all - it just doesn't feel like there's any reason to care. Yes, this can be one of the ways that dysphoria expresses itself, and I wasn't aware that this was part of my dysphoria until I started transitioning and felt it going away for the first time. I didn't know transitioning would also come with being able to care about the world and myself, but for me it did.
When I was 19 I moved 3000 miles away from my family. In that time (without realizing what it meant) I began to spend hours doing my make up, picking out outfits, and investing in my appearance. 

I moved back at 21 for personal reasons. All of that  went out the window. I grew a beard, worked out like crazy, and stopped dressing up. I didn't realize until 7 years later that I had left who I was behind and adapted to this new me as a defense. I was protecting me by hiding. That manifested in a total apathy for my appearance. I didn't by any new clothes, wore my shoes down to the point my feet fell through. I just didn't care. 

Point being apathy is the epitome of avoiding your feelings.
Yes, mine did, 10000000000%. I got recognizable dysphoria after I began transitioning, which is mostly gone now. :)
Definitely, it's very common even
Yes, I was very apathetic before I realized I was trans and it went away even more once I started transitioning
100%. The thought never really occurred to me that I could wear anything besides jeans and a cheap, baggy t-shirt until I was in college.

For context, I’m AFAB, didn’t realize I was trans until, coincidentally, college.
Definitely. I never cared about my appearance, health, life in general until I started transitioning. I was never super unhappy or depressed just always incredibly apathetic toward basically everything. Now I care. I've developed my style, work on skin care, workout, and even style my hair in the morning. I feel a lot more sure of myself and that has diminished the apathy.
I have always been indifferent about the clothes I wear. It was until I explored the chances of being trans that I enjoyed not only shopping but testing out how Id look in certain clothes. I was living my live in a grey scale world and by exploring who I was I saw color being reintroduced.
I feel allot of apathy towards my boymode and always have. I hated shopping for clothes and shoes so much as a kid and would do anything to avoid it including wearing clothes that were much too small trying to get out of shopping. 

I hate it still but it’s more because it makes me so sad that I still have to live in boymode. I get dissociated and have anxiety/panic attacks and have to go out to the car. Usually end up in tears. 

When I can shop for femme clothing though it’s so much fun. Although at the moment that is just bras and stuff of the like it really brings me so much joy and fun. 

I’d say yes it can manifest as apathy.
It absolutely can. I wouldn't say it makes sense to jump to dysphoria as a potential explanation for general apathy without any other reason to believe you're trans, but in context it's certainly possible to go ""yep that was dysphoria.""

Apathy was the main way mine manifested, personally. My therapist was very confused why I was so heavily dissociated at all times with seemingly no root cause. But when I came out as trans and started transitioning, the years of apathy just went up in smoke, and everything felt real and meaningful to me for honestly the first time.
Alternate to the denial beard, lots of us worked out a bunch before realizing that muscles weren't the answer either. That's what I did because my facial hair's patchy af
Ok, thank you! Obviously I don’t wish the feelings I had/have on anyone but it’s nice not to be alone in a way.
I'm more MtX, but I recently came to a revelation about my denial beard of 9 years.

Whenever I was clean-shaven, my mother would tell me how handsome I was. I never liked that word for me, handsome. That word has a particular connotation that just never felt right for me, though I couldn't put my finger on why. So I had some form of facial hair every moment that I could just to avoid that specific compliment. I tried many different styles over the years. None of them really made me happy, but at least I didn't get called handsome too often. I thought that it was just the trope of being embarrassed to be complimented by one's mother, but turns out it was much deeper than that.

Thankfully, since coming out, I've been able to be free of facial hair *and* being called handsome by those close to me.
Well that explains a fuckin lot for me like I struggled for a while with even brushing my teeth and when puberty hit I didn’t properly clean my face or shave, I just didn’t feel like doing it and as I got older it got embarrassing that I didn’t have the skill but I also don’t want anyone seeing me do any self care no one would say anything but even just getting seen shaving my face makes me uncomfortable and I’ve almost never cared about how I look as a result
I had the apathy mustache.
I always hated calling it the denial beard. I wasn't denying anything, I just didn't care. It was a depresso beard.
Ya I'm the few months before my egg broke I grew an apathy beard. Literally couldn't have been bothered to shave for over a month. It wasn't a denial beard because it wasn't too compensate for feelings I was having I just quit literally couldn't give a shit.
holy i never even thought about that... i legit went through all of that. denial beard, not caring and it sucked because i wanted too but felt too gross in my male body..
I went through the denial beard phase because I just didn't want to shave, but then I realized I was gonna need to start putting pomade and shit in it and the moment that happened I shaved it off. From there I went a while shaving every few weeks or so, so I still had facial hair normally but it wasn't long enough to where I had to take care of it. Then I realized I was trans and since then I shave every time I leave the house
All of this and it's very much too late for much of the damage I've done :(
Same
For me it's very similar - The fact that I'm apathetic about most of my body. But even after realizing I'm Trans I still don't do anything at all, because I struggle really hard with executive dysfunction. It's not like I don't do my household or stuff like that - I'm quiet active in these kind of things - but I don't start doing something about dysphoria and stuff.

It's really frustrating, but I literally don't know what to do, even after I got so many different advices and support from others. I can't even get myelf out to look for a gender therapist.
YES!! I used to have a huge beard. I always hated different parts of my body but always just attributed it to diet/fitness culture pushing a body image that I never fit. When I was younger I was always short and liked that but didn't like my shoulders and couldn't figure out why. I wasn't fat but I had some fat on my body, you know like a healthy person should, but hated my mid section. This all continued until like 7 or 8 months ago when it hit me that I don't like my shoulders due to the proportions to my hips and I don't like my mid section because of the same reason it was always that my body didn't have wide hips or curves but in my cishet head space I couldn't figure that out.
This has explained so much about myself that I never knew
oh shit thats like all my clothes
Oh, **oh**, *oh no*.
Yeah, that was definitely me. Black t-shirt, jeans, sneakers. My entire wardrobe for 15 years. I feel seen.
Mine is black gym shorts or jeans, and about 12 different black tshirts and a couple different flannels when it gets cold. O o o o o o o f
I have more shirts than pants and even then they're all unisex. Closest I can get to women's clothing without actually buying women's clothing
Omfg, you get it. You understand. I was the same way, I just didn’t take care of myself. I wouldn’t brush my hair because I just didn’t care, it was like I didn’t see my body as *mine* so I didn’t take care of myself. My hair got so tangled, to the point where when I went to the salon, they decided they couldn’t salvage it and cut it short. Crazy how this stuff starts to make sense after you come out to yourself.
Yeeeepp I think that, pre-realization, I bought fewer than 10 pieces of clothing for myself. All gifts was my wardrobe
Not me questioning if smoking is becoming more of a hindrance now that I'm coming to accept myself 🤔🤨

Also yes, the amount of time I find myself daydreaming back to middle/high school and living as the trans femme I am is astonishing
Thanks. Sorry to hear you had this experience though, it sucks lmao
This type of thing is heartbreaking. I'm going into my late 30's, and you're describing a big chunk of my life that I'll never get back. :-(

It sucks to think that other people got to enjoy vibing with their own gender, and doing the things they wanted to do, while my brain was busy developing coping mechanisms and normalizing dissatisfaction and dissociation.
This fucking nails it for me too yea, such a gut wrenching realization that I've been a zombie for the last 8 years until coming out and starting hormones.
I swear I can't exercise during the day. It's like I have no energy. Kinda think it might be because I don't want to invest in a body that will never look right no matter how hard I were to exercise. Plus then I'd have to be observed by others as male, which I also think is a major energy drain.
I did both ugh
Mine barely grows so I’ve considered getting it lasered off since I don’t even want to put in the effort to shave regularly
GAWWWWDDD reading these comments was so validating to my experience.
Yeah that's me. Just about 10 years ago and getting validation due to being a metalhead and wearing a big beard is considered cool. I didn't hate my beard but I didn't exactly decide to have one either and now I wish I could shave it off without raising questions (got a huge babyface underneath so I'd look like a big 12yo boy lol).
Same
I never realized how relatable this was 😄 
I'm hoping to trade most of my stuff with a transmasc person at some gender-afferming clothing swap sometime.
Yea it sucks. I just got into doing a skin and hair care routine and I've figured out my style though, so it did get better!
Honestly, the only thing we can really do is be more visible for the younger generations so they can be more educated and hopefully find themselves sooner. 😔
Unfortunately we can be the same 😅 swap jeans for baggy walking trousers and this is my wardrobe too"	wjojr9	trans	598	0.99	2022-08-09 00:10:48
I want to help my girlfriend relive highschool as a girl	"I know this sounds weird, but please hear me out.
(This world is new to me, if I offend ANYONE, I will promptly remove it)

Background: 

I am cisgender woman (I'm learning all of this as I go along), my friend is mtf.

I will more often than not ""forget"" she is trans, to the point where as I'm going through her clothes trying to find something to wear, I'll see white pants, pull them out, and shockingly ask ""why would you risk having these?!"" Or when I'm braiding her hair I will ask ""don't you feel like you're in highschool again?"" This typically will bring up bad memories for her, and I feel like an awful person. But that's beside the point. 

Her parents are not supportive of her, so they were no help, but I'm trying to teach her everything: properly care for her hair, nails, and skin. Teaching her to braid, put her hair up in a ponytail, bun, ect. Practice walking in heels. (This is all things that she wants, I'm helping, NOT forcing)

When we finally got heels, it hit me: ""do you want to redo your prom? Properly this time?"" And she just broke down in happy tears. 

Advice:

This got me thinking: what other iconic high school things can I recreate for her? It's been years since I've been in highschool, and honestly, I wasn't very ""mainstream girly"" when I WAS there. 

So, are there any things that anyone wish that they could redo as their true self? Anything that I could do for my friend?

Also, there are a few other questions I have, but this is the first and foremost (questions like 'how can I help her with her disphoria' and 'what can I do to encourage her'. Not anything degrading - I hope) If anyone is willing to dm me, I'd really appreciate it.

Edits: I added that I am a woman, and removed info that wasn't necessary.
 I realized that everyone is thinking about highschool dates and such. Not necessary. What are some highschool things that a bunch of girls did that I can do for her?"	"My god, you are a saint.

I can’t speak for the rest of the trans women here but high school was hell for me.  Of course, I went in the 90’s so I’m probably older than you but it was rough.  I was confused and depressed because of my upbringing.  Being trans wasn’t really a known thing back then.  I was hella confused about who and what I was.  Gay kids were deeply closeted and those that were really effeminate and couldn’t hide it were tormented.  One guy I knew but wasn’t friends with actually killed himself 10 years ago.  It was tough to be different in a small town back then.  So I fucking hid.  I never put my head above the water so to speak.  I’m part of the pack, never leading and never following.  Hide.  Even today I have a hard time with things and I’m in my early 40’s because I was basically forced to grease all the skids, reduce all friction, move with the group.  While I didn’t get treated too poorly in general, I never had many friends and always thought it was hell.  I would never want to live the high school experience.  It would remind me of everything including the boorish comments about the girls that offended me because I wanted to be the girls, not be with them.

Edit:
All that to say, make sure she’s okay with it first.  She may not wish to relive it even as a girl rather than a girl pretending to be a boy.
Sleepovers!
i’m fucking crying i want to come 😭 you’re a fantastic friend, if she’s sporty maybe do cheer shit too. the only thing i want to redo is prom because all other school dances for me were informal and we didn’t really have anything else besides dances? like homecoming but that’s just Prom Lite™
I'm danish - I have no frame of reference. 

But omfg this is so cute <3 You're a treasure <3
You sound like an amazing friend who cares deeply.  She is so lucky to have someone like you in her life!  As far as reliving things go it’s probably going to vary wildly for each person.  Asking her if there’s anything she wishes she had done and then try to do it!
[deleted]
Maybee like homecoming week, like dress up as different things, it would be perfect.
You all ready are doing so much better then most people, I sadly started to transition after I found me true self after high school. I would absolutely love to have a friend like you, keep doing what your doing she's so lucky to have a friend like you.
Prom was never my kinda thing but man oh man do I wish I could someday relive some of the stuff I never got to do that I should have... OP I'll be honest this post has me in a bittersweet mood right now. Happy for your girlfriend that she has such a great and caring person in you and sadness for myself, that I don't have anyone like you.

I don't have any answers myself but I hope you get some good ideas!
You're an amazing person
Gosh you are just wonderful. I'm so happy you have each other <3
Getting all dressed up, going out and taking pics, having a fancy dinner! I did this in High School when we had our “anti” prom 😂 just some ideas :)
I don’t know. I had a triple threat of small catholic school, coronavirus, and dysphoria rob from me whatever high school I was supposed to have.
You are an amazing partner, and she's lucky to have you!
you are *NOT* a bad person. let's get that straight. i'm late to the party as multiple others have said it probably, but I just want to make that clear since it's rare to find lightbulbs in a world of pure and utter darkness.

tbh though highschool fucking sucks lmao. I'm in it right now and to be honest, apart from prom (which...that statement and her reaction made me smile irl lol), it's literally just either sitting at a classroom desk doing nothing or participating in some dumbass sport. why relive something that even most cisgender people probably hated?

she might have some trauma from her highschool years, but I think that's more of an issue with therapy rather than you and her individually. you're there for her, and to be quite honest: that's more than enough.

now *college* years? **THAT'S** what you want to start reliving with her! (assuming you aren't already in college lol).
You sound like an amazing person and I wish we could all have someone like you in our lives. Prom is definitely one of the biggest ones, but she probably has others. Maybe give an invitation that you’re willing to help her experience things she didn’t get to, so it’s clear that she can ask you if she thinks of anything, as it can help to have confirmation you can ask. You might have already done something like that, but she might have something that no one else would think of so I thought it wouldn’t be bad to add it just in case.
So this maybe isn't highschool, but what about a tea party or like a princess themed dinner? More stuff for little girls but still fun to relive! 

Sleepovers with Barbie or Bratz movies. Classic high school ""girly"" movies. Gossip about boys (or girls), in that goofy ""Who do you like??"" Way that kids do lol.

This is a really fun idea! You're a great friend :)
Sounds like you just being there and doing what you can is the greatest gift she could ask for right now.  You are an amazing friend, could only wish for more people with your heart to put there for more of us not just words but actions too 🖤💖🖤💖

I’m like you, I never really participated in school stuff, I was an awkward boy and super shy to stand out.  As a woman I have found that strong backbone and confidence I’ve been missing all my life. I can only imagine what life would of been like if I started transitioning in school would I have more or less friends then I did (3).
As a teen prom was big yes but the old pizza, movie and hang date is so high-school. Never had it myself as a teen other than with my dnd friends before game night.
You're a saint !
You are a fucking *saint* my guy. 
I'm a trans kid. And in highschool, and I honestly hate living it, because I'm not living my own highschool as me. 
Maybe you could recreate some classrooms(if you remember any of them) events in your school, like homecoming, or spirit week. Y'all could even recreate old projects, but put her chosen name on them instead. 

Just a thought
This honestly warms my heart. It's so sweet that you're taking the time to help her get things right that were wrong in the past. Everyone needs a friend like you 💜
you are a very good friend to help your friend.  This may not be high school level, but if your friend likes dancing, consider taking some dance classes with her in what ever type of dancing styles she likes.  It will give her and you a good excuse to dress up and go dancing.  She can feel good about wearing a fancy/pretty prom type dress while she looks amazing and you both dance a night away.
You are a truly good person and I hope you have a good day :)
man this has made my fucking day you beautiful human being
Have no advice but wanted to say you're the best friend in the world.
It's so hard for us who transitionned late to know we've missed our teenage years as ourselves. I'd give everyone for a chance to relive high school, first dates, girls sleepovers, prom and everything as my real self... 
Honestly, I'm already melting when my best friend compliments me on how cute I'm becoming, but this is definitely next level ❤️
Same
Prom. Good God prom.

Is it too much to ask to have all my friends dress up and we have a dance at some shitty gym?! How is that not the best thing in the world post quarantine? I DON'T WANNA WAIT FOR YOU JERKS TO GET MARRIED TO PUT ON A POOFY DRESS!
As a trans girl in high school going through as a girl this advice might sound kind of hollow and I’d also suggest you don’t give her this advice directly because it would probably sound hollow coming from you too buy I think I’d look a head to the future. My elementary and middle school years were stolen from me just like her high school years but the way I handle that is living my best life now. Help her doing different event now that are important. Also if y’all want to recreate old high school events and relive them go for it I’m not saying don’t do that that honestly is a great idea and sounds like a ton of fun I’m just saying not to dwell on the past. Also your an actual saint friends like you are what make life worth living.
I am just starting my transition and I don’t have anything to add on. But you are absolutely an amazing person! You are truly being there for her! And I am so happy that you are being so kind! Keep being the best queen
You could go to a dance club if you wanna that part of prom too! They're pretty fun
If I had a friend like you'd I'd cry all my tears out of happiness 🥺
I am a senior in high school right now and I have a trans girl friend who’s a freshman. I so badly wish I had learned to do makeup so I could do it for her 😭

Makeup always just seemed like a waste of time to me - I mean I’m non-binary so maybe that has something to do with it.
Okay I don’t exactly now what you could do but omg you sound like the most incredible friend ever!! Xx
oh my heart, way to go above and beyond you absolute saint
I never actually went to prom, but I think that if I picked out something I really liked in a supportive atmosphere - and I could go wild with any clothing I wanted, then I would. I wouldn't really know what to do at prom after all though. I might go for some snacks.
Maybe you could do anything you wanted, but wearing prom stuff. That would be cool.

It was awesome hearing about all that cool stuff you're doing for you friend, and how happy it makes her. Keep doing good 😊
OP, the sentiment is beautiful, I really think you  should talk her about it.  :)

🥰
high school was still hell in the 00s, i was one of those who got sent to an all boys school when i was effeminate, the homophobic bullying was something i still haven't even tried to unpack and deal with.   


single gender schools should be banned.
I second this. OP, you are a beautiful person. We should all be blessed with someone like you. I have no advice to give, but I can say that I've personally fantasized about the women I work with all inviting me out for a girl's day/night, and it brings me to tears thinking about it.

The fact that you are including your friend and just treating her like just another girl friend is truly wonderful. The pain of feeling like you were robbed of the ""proper"" childhood is very real, and what you're trying to do for your friend might be one of the kindest things you will ever do for another person.

Thank you for being an ally. The world needs more people like you.
Oh of course! We've already had one. I had a nice girl night and we laughed until 5 am.
Actually, SHE is. And I wish I could help her see it. I'm kinda falling hard for this girl. And so I want her to see herself as I see her. Hence why I'm on this subreddit. I didn't know if I would be pushing boundaries by butting in.
I agree! Communication is always key, but I like to surprise her with little things... Big things like prom are a talk, but that goes without saying. Oh my goodness, I get to do a ""prom-posal""! Kinda excited.
It would be nice 🥺
We actually ARE in college! That's how I met her! But college is already being lived as herself. 
I got a nice idea to play hookie! We'll blow off school (I'll make sure she doesn't have anything important) and go elsewhere. I remember going to six flags, but she doesn't like rollercoasters, so I'm thinking I'll have to look into different festivals going on.
That. Is. BRILLIANT! OH MY GOODNESS! WHY DIDNT I THINK OF THAT!? Do you have any other ideas!?
Haha! I've never been able to say this! So I'm taking the opportunity! ""Girl""! I'm a cisgender woman. 
We are actually in college now, and so the ""projects"" we have, her name goes on.
Okay, PLEASE correct me if I'm wrong:
""Becoming""- that word makes me shutter. 
No. It should be ""..how cute I AM"" 
You ARE beautiful. 
My friend will sometimes say ""happy trans girl"" and eventually I figured out why it bothered me. 
""Happy girl"". That is what she is, and the adjective before girl is unnecessary, because she is a woman. 

So I'm glad your best friend comments on how cute you are!
You can still learn!!! Even just being there with her while she watches YouTube vids or something could be fun. And if you wanted to participate you could look up makeup for men or gender neutral makeup, or costume make up.
Thank you for saying this. I will automatically fix her pronouns when people are talking to her (she appreciates this, she's shy/soft spoken and will more often than not slightly cringe, then stay quiet) but I didn't know how to correct this without sounding mean. 

I agree, there are things that would need to be discussed, but I also like to surprise her. So little things will be nice too.
Should I remove that info? Is it rude? Please don't get offended, I really just don't know.
I’m sorry you’re right!  I’m super embarrassed right now.  I will fix that
Oh god, I’m so sorry for that.
Aww! You two sound so cute! Maybe like... Try cheerleading or something :3 You don't even have to get technical. Just the outfits give me euphoria lol
God you’re perfect I wish there were more people like you! Personally I wish I could redo prom, homecoming (but it can just be the same as prom tbh), going to sporting events as myself instead of wearing this huge hoodie that made me feel better about my self image, sleepovers, girls day out like going to the mall or getting a mani/pedi. Stuff like that. I just kept in the closet most of my high school life until senior year but then only my closest friends knew. I’m pretty early on in my transition like super early and I was deathly afraid of going to get my eyebrows done, getting a manicure or a pedicure, or going to an actual store to shop. I always needed a buddy because I felts super awkward and judged personally.
:D

Thats good then! She's already living in the time where she'll *actually* make memories. I'm sure you won't need to worry about recreating much from the past tbh.

I also dont like rollercoasters myself too, so maybe I'll be of assistance maybe. What does she take great interest in?
Friendship bracelets was the first thing that came to mind. I will comment more if I think of anything lol

As a trans masc person I love giving out this info, all those years of forced girlhood are coming in handy 🤣
I’m not super into wearing makeup myself, I have autism and every time I’ve been forced to wear it for special events it’s been uncomfortable? But I think it would be fun to put it on someone else
Idea, if you hear someone misgender her just say, ""Well, actually this is my girlfreind.""
I think prom is a good place to start fs
I screwed up with the pronouns typing fast and that was bad and I’m sorry.  Also, fixed them.

So if you want to surprise her with something from high school, then yeah I think the dance aspect would be a blast.  I’m sure most of us didn’t want to be there in a suit.
Thank you so much"	qd4dj5	trans	591	0.99	2021-10-21 23:39:25

finally got my first ever gender affirmative clothes!!! *happy trans sounds*		"Disgusting. You should have more gender affirming clothes
I spent about 500$ this year on gender affirmative cloths..., but the store i bought them all at has very few items over 20$, so I got alot of stuff!
Thats a cute yellow top! Good for you ❤
They're so pretty! You are  so lucky!
love the outfit possibilities!
Proud of you! It all looks super cute.
Congratulations!
I did the same a few months ago. I thought: ""well, I'm working from home, I'm not spending time around people, I might as well just get something I like. Then I discovered shopping. My wallet is getting lighter. I may need a bag for it soon, though.
I love that feel, as soon as my wardrobe made me look like myself i became so much happier. Good luck on the journey, it will be a fun one, it can be difficult, but know that it is worth it.
Omg they look so cute! How do they feel!!!?
I really like your bed sheets!
VERY cute clothes! Congrats! ❤❤
What does a happy trans sound sound like? 😅
That's so nice! Happy for you

btw, im trying to go for good prices as well. clothing is so much expensive isn't it?
Thank youu! Fells great actually. But I'm still finding my style, tho
I have become addicted to Shein. Quality is pretty good and so cheap. Especially if you sort from low to high on the prices."	jpy1i3	trans	576	0.99	2020-11-07 20:50:00
Tips for trans girl- from a trans guy	"I spent much of my teen years being hyper fixated on my appearance and terribly dysphoric about my body, so I made great effort to make myself appear more masculine and strictly avoid certain things. These things eventually became a burden to my everyday life but now that I’m in a much better place and my dysphoria has gotten better I realize that some of these things I was trying to avoid could actually help out a lot of trans girls! So here’s a small list of tips, feel free to add your own!

1. Long hair doesn’t automatically mean feminine- short hair doesn’t automatically mean masculine. If you’re a trans girl still trying to grow out your hair try looking at your face shape and the pixie cuts recommended by hair stylists. Pixie cuts immediately look very feminine and really pretty! (my big mistake was asking for a pixie cut at the hair salon! forcibly feminized!)

2. Accessorize with jewelry- lots of it. Often during the years I looked androgynous people would notice I was wearing earrings or necklaces and that would push them in the feminine direction

3. If you have a lot of body hair and can’t always keep up with shaving, try conditioning your body hair- especially the pubic area. It’ll look and feel softer and feel nice. 

4. Shape your eyebrows- women for some reason tend to have thinner eyebrows- the more angular the more feminine you’ll probably be perceived. Go with your face shape, of course. 

5. You may be surprised- but layering your clothes can help! This is often a tip geared towards trans guys, but if you’re still self conscious about your body shape wearing layers can help hide some things and accentuate others. If you’re not the biggest fan of your legs, try tights and a longer skirt- if you’re not the biggest fan of your shoulders, try to even out your silhouette by accentuating your hips. FITTED pants go a long way, ironically enough skinny jeans have become the standard for cis men (?? idk why??) and they can sometimes be unflattering especially if you’re on the skinnier side because they show the exact shape of your legs. Try pants that fit your waist really well but are just a bit too big in the legs- that way your hips will stand out more and create a more feminine shape- belts help a lot with this. 

6. Tits really don’t matter- I’ve passed as male with and without them. Its more so about how your clothes sit on your body. V necks look more feminine than U necks. If you have broad shoulders try shirts with big sleeves- sweater paws are an instant feminizer. 

7. A little bit of makeup really goes a long way- focus on the eyes a lot. Pigment and darkness around the eyes and eyelashes instantly feminizes the face regardless of everything else in most cases. Try gloss instead of lipstick sometimes. Having nice skin can also help, not to say you have to be acne free, but keeping your skin nice and moisturized helps a lot.  Color correction and soft skin can help diminish or erase a 5 o clock shadow really well. 

8. SMELL GOOD. Experiment with perfume and soap. Boys are stinky. 

9. Hair and nail accessories- clips and pins. There’re cute and can often be cheap. If sitting in a nail salon scares you, try press on nails. Learn your style and aesthetic, brows pinterest, look around your local thrift shop. What’s worse than being dysphoric? Being dysphoric in an unflattering outfit! 

10. Understand that all women look different! Decolonize your beauty standards! I’ve heard “my hands are too big” “my jaw is too strong” too many times! All women look different, and not all women- even cis women- have small chins and feminine hips. Big noses, strong brow bones, and long legs are beautiful too! (plus tall women are hot)

Trans people are resilient and strong by nature. You got this, girls!"	"Oh yea for the budge issue try pants with a waist that are actually a bit too big and use a belt. If the legs are too long cuff them. Your privates will be more hidden because the extra fabric creates a bigger/ longer crotch. Skinny jeans are the worst for this!! Stay away!!
Awesome tips, thanks!  What about jackets in cooler weather?  Any suggestions for them if your shoulders are just a little too broad?  Don’t want to hulk them out before my muscles mass decreases.  Just get larger sizes even if it’s a potato sack at that point?
I'm taking notes 👀
Aww, thank you very much for the tips, you sir are legendary. <3
THANK YOU!!!!
As a trans girl trying to be more feminine some more things I have found which work pre-hrt. However I still don't think I pass for shit.

Long sleeves with puffed/rolled cuffs tend to mask big hands and wrists, as well as make large biceps and forearms less noticeable.

Straps need to be wide, thin straps look highly unflattering on wide shoulders.

For shirts exposing only the waist is not a good idea if you are like me and still have a wide one

Shirts with a seam that goes diagonally from the collarbone to the chest for the sleeve, rather than a straight shoulder seam tends to help break up the squareness of muscular shoulders. So look for rounded shoulders on your clothes.

Even better if it can not have shoulders entirely, but then have sleeves.

Belts are good for cinching your clothes in the right place, but can fall down quite easily.

Wearing a puffy top and something which hugs the body from the underbust to the waist and then widens at the hips makes you appear to have more on your chest than you actually do, artificially slims your waist and widens your hips.

Skirts, funnily enough, look really feminine. They also hide masculine legs and buts + are good for note getting the dreaded bulge. If you feel you can pull one off give it a go, beware most of these lack pockets, perhaps adding a bag as an accessory is good. Take care when choosing them though, I find simplicity is very good, too much texture and it looks garish.

Posture, if you stand like a guy people will look for masculine things about you, look at how women stand and walk, emulate that.

Taking care of your hair and skin will not only feel better but it will make you look more feminine, and uneven complexion and oily, messy hair does not help your image. Brush it often, wash often but not too often. Find out what sort of products you need to get it to a consistency you like.

Volume, in many things can be good. I break up the squareness of my head and face by using a volumizing conditioner. Voluminous clothes can be good for hiding masculine traits in, they bring you towards an androgynous look

If you're super veiny like me then keep cool and stay calm, high heart rate and breathing increases your blood pressure which makes that stand out

Style your hair it into places where it makes your face take the right shape. You can use products for this (I tend not to because I have ridiculously sensitive skin). Be aware of where it parts and how far up it is so stand in front of a mirror and play around until you get something that fits. Asymmetry tends to be helpful. Equally develop a habit where you brush your hair into the right shape when it falls out of shape. I always used to keep my hair out of my face by flicking it back or moving it behind my ears with my thumbs. Touching my hair with my hands got it dirty really quickly, and brushing both sides behind my ears brings it to a quite masculine hairstyle. I've learned where I need to get it so it looks right and I check when I walk around, maintaining how you look is as important as getting there.

Make sure what you are wearing fits you correctly, a small change in the angle, tightness, texture or amount of fabric somewhere can make a huge difference. Play around with that and see what looks good. I suggest learning a little bit of sewing and taking in/ letting out the parts which need that

Color as well as patterns and their business can help. Darker shades tend to make me look more masculine so I avoid them, however dark pants/skirts/dresses with a lighter top tends to make me look more feminine. Busy vs not busy is also something to consider as well as how sharp or angular the patterns you are wearing are, but I haven't found any rules here, just that some look more masculine and some look more feminine so exercise judgement.

Some theory, figure out what parts of you look most feminine and make them show, while using the shape of clothing to hide what doesn't. Cis women have been doing this for a long time, as many of them have bodies which are pretty masculine, there will be a cut, or a technique which will make your body do the right things, we humans are cunning like that.

If you really want, hip inserts and such things exist. I hate the idea of doing that because I want to be as feminine with my clothing off as with it on, but needs must. I just work out that part of my body obsessively.

Not everything here will transfer to everyone, I am tall, thin and leggy, I have long and muscular arms, big hands, and wide shoulders so that's where I focus my energy. Some of what I say here will be counter intuitive for you if your body shape is different.

I wish you all luck on your journeys.
These are some fantastic tips. Thanks, dude! The eyebrows are one that I notice now and then, probably because I have manbrows myself. Those are great clothing tips, too. I can envision exactly the kind of pants of which ~~the legends~~ you speak.

I agree with number ten all the way. My wife has PCOS, yet in spite of all the features she has that are androgynous or masculine, she is unmistakably a woman. She's so self-conscious about them, but I honestly didn't notice until she pointed them out. The human mind weighs what it notices, maked the decision on gender, and just ignores the small inconsistencies it finds irrelevant.
in general, the more effort you put into your appearance the more femme you will appear, and vice versa. That’s the “how can I pass” rule of thumb.
OP, I know you probably wont read this, but this literally caused me to start crying cause I've needed this kind of advice for a long time. It's one of those things it doesnt help now, but one day, when I'm safe, it will. Thank you so much....:')
I love this advice 💕
Bro you're a lifesaver!
The skinny jeans thing, my legs and butt are actually a good shape and I get huge euphoria from seeing them in skinny jeans, the problem is where my belly sits, it rides, I think, too high and makes me look weird. I disguise it with long shirts but I would love to know if there's anything else I can do.
Thank you dude, you’re a godsend 💕
Hello dude!
I love your tips, really a great help for girls like me.
Thanks a lot!
im a trans guy but to all you girls this is good advice
Agree with these. Thank you :)
Good tips. When I tuck with 2 pairs of underwear I don't worry if the tuck is a little loose, I'll def fix it if it's bad but almost nobody is looking down there and even most ppl who do don't notice,even cis-women can have a small 'buldge'
Tysm I'm bookmarking this post
Omg does anyone have any tips to tweeze your eyebrows? I want to make mine look more feminine but dk where to start?
God I have no idea what I'm doing when it comes to eyebrows and since I'm stuck at my college, I'm not really in a position to get them done by someone else. I should really get on that when I get home. I feel like I'd like my face better if my eyebrows were cuter. ;-;
Thank you :)
Saving the hell out of this post. Thank you!
Thanks for writing this! This is just the best post!
Great advice dude. I've never paid much attention to the hair style and only length. Accessories definitely go a long way, having a necklace on me helps me pass.
Thank you for all the advice! You are amazing <3
The sacred text
This is going to be my bible lol
Why don't you want guys wearing skinny jeans xd
I wish there was a way to save reddit posts. These are great tips!
Good advice! I am so. Damn. Glad. That high waisted cargo pants, loose baggy jeans, and overalls are the in thing for girls right now. 

Just makes it so much easier to transition when the loose fit hides everything while I’m in the process of transitioning.
whenever you’re too big in one area try to either diminish it or even it out. I’d actually suggest a thinner coat thats longer or the opposite- something like a leather jacket that stops early- those always look really feminine. The best thing to do if u have a wide top half it to try to balance out your bottom half- ur hips and butt. Plus broad shoulders can look really really attractive on a woman especially if she got some nice arms too… big shoulders are definitely not a deal breaker!
Take the sweater paw rule to heart! Find a jacket that ends in a big poofy sleeve and small wrist collar! Bonus points if they have a cute print/color or oversized collar which are also feminine features
Maybe try adding a big circle scarf (knitted) that will break up the lines in that area.
plus you’ll probably be feeling more confident which also helps with passing
Im glad it was able to help some people out! :)
maybe try putting something like a flannel over it and only buttoning up the bottom few and leaving the rest open. The only problem is it might hide ur butt a little bit. you could also just try high waisted pants that cover the bottom half of your belly.
go with the shape of your eye and your face. The start of your eyebrow should be at the start of your eye tear ducts, the highest point should be somewhere in the middle of your pupil. Often if you don’t have the precision to pluck ur eyebrows using a small cheap shaving razor or a brow razor can help a lot. Try to angle the downside of your eyebrow (after the arch) to the angle of your cheekbones so they could almost follow the same line. That might not make any sense lol but if you look at pictures of feminine faces you’ll see what I mean. Keep a lot of references of pretty women with the same face shape as yours. You got this!
I just think they’re ugly. Just my stupid opinion
Between the bell and the three vertical dots in the upper right.
Well does u/infj_mtf have good news for you
Well, I’m not TOO big.  I can wear them but I can’t move too much because it feels like I am stretching them out and will rip them - or at least I’m afraid I will.  Once I lose some muscle mass I think I’ll be good though.  I do like the shorter jackets though, some of them are super cute!
Cool, thanks for the tip!  I hadn’t actually heard of the sweater paw rule before.
Oh. I'm dumb. Thanks!
you’ll look your best in whatever you’re most confident in! These are all tips but none of them are rules. There are things that work for you that won’t work for any other woman. Try out as many jackets as you can!
Oh haha it's not a ""rule"" I was referring to #6 on this list!
Dumb and unaware are different. You were unaware. Happy to help!
Thanks!  I can’t believe you haven’t got more replies, your a cool dude!"	qptmc3	trans	577	1.0	2021-11-09 02:27:31
Me as a child: This is so unfair!! Me as a grown-up trans: uwu		"Patriarchal society. 🤦‍♀️ This guy on the left should not be this happy. It creeps me out. 😒
It's because women are just being ""cute"" and ""confused"" and as soon as they have a kid they'll ""grow up"" . Same reason lesbians ""didn't exist."" 


Gay men are viewed by thee people as possible predators. Trans men are viewed as taking it a step further, I think. And men should not want to be a woman because it's ""inferior.""
[this is unfair](https://tenor.com/bVS3I.gif)
Yeah no when I thought I was a girl and dressed in men's clothes (ftm now) I got slurs thrown at me and beat up once, kicked out of my house. Not that the struggles are the same, but society absolutely doesn't embrace girls dressing masc.
This is a bit oversimplified imo.
Society hated women wearing pants and male clothing for a very long time too
yeah, no, baggy clothes don't make them masculine, I DOUBT op is referring to actual masculine girls
I always hated the double standards of wearing clothes this way
Eh... No. Both are bad looked. (Or saw? IDK).
Img date before 2000...
This. Literally gets me like heated if I think about it too long. And fuck the concept of “boys and girls” clothes. They’re clothes. And they’re mine☺️
Yeah I hate that. Can’t even explore who I am openly. Do it in secret 🤫
this is so unfair why tho-
Not gonna lie, those Jedi robes look comfy as heck.
r/transclones
""Looked down upon"" might be what you want?
when was the last time you heard about women getting hate crimed or had slurs thrown at them for wearing a baggy t shirt or jeans? it's for all the wrong reasons (patriarchy gobbledygook), but girls in stereotypically male clothing are nowhere near as looked down upon as boys in stereotypically female clothing (though in more ""traditional"" societies, *both* of these are ""wrong"", which is somehow worse)
I made a pretty good jedi cosplay back in middle school so I can tell from experience that, they are (and they make for a pretty convincing mage robe for your dnd sessions as well)
""jeans"" are not necessarily masculine, now. i definitely got harassed and physically abused for dressing and presenting myself ugly and masculine my entire childhood -- i didn't shave, except my head, i wore cargo pants and camo from the men's section whenever my parents let me get away from it. i had no friends, i was mocked and excluded for looking like a lesbian or looking like a man.

and im not saying it was as likely to get me into trouble as someone perceived as male wearing something overtly feminine. absolutely not. but saying we never get hit or slurs thrown at us for it is absolutely not true. like, absolutely the fuck not. none of the trans men or butch folks ive spoken to irl has had their masculine presentation ""accepted"" without abuse.

like, cute pixie cut and jeans? sure, mostly fine! but any further than that and you *are* in danger.
Yes it's because ""men"" are seen as the default or absence of gender, a large part of the privilege afforded to them by patriarchy
I'm not a girl, but socially I am 'cause I'm not out, I'm from Brazil so Idk about your country, but it's not like that here. Just because you don't hear abt it, doesn't mean those things don't happen. To validate your feelings, you don't need to invalidate others'.
Yesterday actually. I'm ftm but a lot of people in my school don't know that and I pointedly get made fun of for the clothes I wear. I'm sure you can guess some of the words I'm called but some of them are borderline s*xual harassment. Ex: Last week I wore a baggy hoodie and basketball shorts and for some reason that was enough for this group of dudes to point that out and say ""Wanna see how a REAL man works?""

Which kinda freaked me out thinking they found out I was trans but I think it was more of them believing I was lesbian
At least in Latino America there is a lot of women who still are teached how ""sit as a lady"" (In their words) and also, some older see wrong to women with different hair dye than just blonde, so you can imagine using sleeveless shirt as woman or jacket.

And things like that I see and hear reciently.
Ugggghhhhh fine I'll go figure out a jedi cosplay costume sheesh.
I agree, privilege seems to afford them a whole lot of stuff but I'm happy that it also seems to start taking from them as well, another good sign to throw it out
I'm actually well aware of this, which is why I included the bottom set of parentheses cause I know in some more gender role heavy places they still subscribe to gendered dress codes (especially places like some parts of the middle east) I'm sorry if this came off as hurtful nonetheless
it's relatively easy to make if you have at least sewing basics. I'm sure you can do it
Wdym happy? 😧
It's okay and I do understand your side tho, I think I just took it personally because of my experiences of where I live, so I'm sorry for being rude.
I have managed to sew on a loose button once or twice and while I have used a sewing machine, it was many years ago and I was sewing in straight lines. Super long story there.
happy that the universal flaws of patriarchy are coming to light so that more people turn against it, patriarchy's mad stupid

I have an idea for an app for trans people and I'd like yalls opinion on it	It functions similarly to tinder, except at the beginning you put your clothing size/shoe size and the kind of clothing you'd be looking for(ie feminine, masc, androgynous) and the clothing you are giving away, and it would match you up with someone who fit your size and the description of the clothes you want to give away. I feel like this would work well for people who don't have money to buy a completely new wardrobe, or people who just turned 18 and don't have a lot of options yet. Suggestions and revisions highly appreciated, thanks!	"That sounds really cool
I have one word for you. YES
Also would there be a minimum age?
If you want that to actually work, and to do it as a real business, you have to eliminate the need for people to meet up. Too much danger, liability, and it drastically limits who you can swap clothes with.

If you're doing it as clothing swaps, that's really hard to manage. But if instead you set it up such that people give away the clothes for free, and people buy stuff on the site for the cost of shipping (plus 5% or something to cover the costs of running the business), then that way the business can serve as a central shipping source and destination for everything, and no two users ever have to know each other's address or location.

So when you sign up, you put in a shipping address. When you want to give something away, you list it on the site. When somebody else wants it, they pay as much as it will cost you to ship the stuff to the central location, and for the central location to ship it to the buyer.

(There might be ways to improve that; it's possible that when the buyer buys something, then the sender gets e-mailed a pre-paid shipping label that has the destination information obscured through a QR code. All they ahve to do is package the stuff, slap the label on it, and drop it off at their local UPS place or whatever.)

But anyway, you see the point: make sure that any user can get clothes from any other user, no matter where the two of them live, and make sure nobody ever knows where anybody else lives.

You could probably add all kinds of other fun things, like maybe when you give stuff away you also get some amount of credits towards free shipping of something you want. So it would be kind of like Poshmark, except the sellers are never getting money (which is also convenient for you as a business, since you don't need to deal with the hassle of paying your users).
Interesting concept im actually an app developer for android and iOS feel free to dm me about this inquiry
I am very much here for this
I absolutely love this YES
We do (Or did, before covid...) local meetups like this here, being in a west coast city. My only concern is you'd need some way to insure safety of people using the app.

It'd be too easy for a transphobe to get on there and get ahold of personal information for trans people. (Such as addresses) Or even talk them into a meetup where they harass / assault them or worse. There would need to be some measure(s) in place to stop them.

Trans spaces are the constant target of harassment campaigns, including people willing to fake being trans to worm their way in, and you essentially need to expect and be ready for that to start happening from day one.
Unfortunately I think it’s simply much easier to just create a discord for this purpose, since it would be much easier to verify users’ identities since everyone trans is already on discord lol. And like I’d be willing to give away my old clothes without a trade as long as I trusted the users in the discord as well. Also communication is much easier on discord than in a separate app imho.
That’s just what I think is much easier anyways. If you make it that would be cool! But hosting an app yourself can be costly and complicated.
Seems like a pretty interesting idea to me. I feel like cross dressers would take advantage of this too though.
YES
Absolutely. I think this is a fantastic idea!
Not to discourage this idea, i will say pre covid most nearby hrc or lgbt centers have a clothes donation bin for trans people. Idk about rn. Also there is a sub for it too but its pretty dead ngl.
I love this idea! :)
Brilliant idea.
I'd use the hell out of that. I forever have clothes to share.
You might get some solid advice from the good folk over at r/transtrade
Ooh I should’ve thought of this for my schools app project!
I would honestly love an app like this
I think this would be even better for people without a lot of money too. You have clothes to give away? Give them away to those who need it. Of course, that's what we call a charity but I imagine cutting out the middle man would be easier to get things directly
Yes please. I don't even know where to start with clothing and this would help immensely.
This would be amazing!😲
What if you are looking for cute clothes? Because sometimes I don't like saying that my clothes are fem/masc/androgyn but rather just cute. Tbh if the clothes are just labeled as cute, hot, cool I would be always getting euphoria.
Yes! a couple of things though, 1. would it be for all over the world or just for america if so i think that people should also have to put in what country/state in, and the should be some way to insure that people only meet in public places i.e a park, and a way to only match you with people within a couple hour drive
One word, YES, please for the love of god i have like over 150 of my old clothes i want gone and replaced, this would be such a game changer i feel like, its something that would get popular if done the correct way
Sign me up!
My dream😻 go ahead, I've always wanted some app like this
I approve
Hell yeah! I’d sign up. Still have a few boy clothes I’d like to trade ^-^
clothes trading app? Sounds based
Hmmm... sounds good, like an online thrift store. I'm all for it! Say no to brand new!
I’d switch tactics a bit, for safety sake (both for the individuals and you in a legal sense) is stick with shipping, you may be able to get a discounted rate for shipping with a business account

Second, I’d stray away from ‘free’ as for one, it takes money to keep an app up, secure, and to cover potential legal costs or IP theft down the line, plus it would be a good gimmick of sorts to use to spread word of it in the trans community, say for instance the 99cent trans clothing exchange, of course that wouldn’t include shipping. Take something like 10% to cover payment processing fees and should leave you with something like 3-5 cents for each sale, not much but if it did VERY well it’s enough to cover costs to keep servers and the app up and operating, aswell as a tiny legal budget.
that sounds amazing tho
Probably 18, as a child meeting up with an adult would be suspicious, and as you are probably aware, people pretend to be over or under 18 on pretty much every social media site
I think this is a different usecase entirely. Also, it's way harder to set up a distribution center than an app!

I think that OP's idea can actually work, and safety can be ensured.

We have this service in my country where you can send stuff to a place where the person picks it up, the places are everywhere (I live in capital and there are at least three I can walk to under 15 minutes). So just navigate your users to send stuff via such service instead of meeting/sending to their address. Or even collaborate with such service and set up your app in a way that it's the easiest option for them.
Same if you need additional help
I'm very aware of this, and obviously addresses wouldn't be public. The only things you would be sharing is clothing size and style that you own and your preferences.
I mean I wouldn't see a problem with them using it as well, I mean it has to be two people who are agreeing to swap clothes.
Sure! There would most likely just be a huge scrolldown list of all of the kinds of clothes you can choose from
I used meetup sites when I was under 18 I just always carried a knife (a reasonably sized one in my pocket) and a boot knife and always kept my phone on me and never ran into any problems. Liability wise though you would definitely wanna discourage that
Feel free to dm me if you want moral support because I can't code for shit lmao
Yeah, I didn't figure it's just display addresses publicly. I don't think even eBay does that anymore. If they got to the point of a meet up it could be an issue though.

A lot of IRL meetups like this stay safe by meeting in relatively public places, and having several people meet up at once!
An option for this would be to have an application process. I know a couple of the higher class dating sites do applications.
another issue i can see is someone catfishing a trans person and meeting up with them with violent intent
Then I would definitely like it a lot
That's true as well, but that could happen to anyone on any app that is used for dating and meeting up, so it is a sort of at-your-own-risk deal for using any app like that.
At least in the US, police stations commonly let you complete your (legal, of course) internet transactions in their parking lots.
That's still a pretty big ask for most trans folks, we're not exactly on the best of terms with cops by default. It's adding a lot I admit, not least in terms of cost, but an intermediary service that receives, cleans inspects and reships the clothes could allow both parties to remain anonymous, and that could be a major selling point...
Yes of course you could have the option of shipping, but shipping itself is expensive, and given someone or myself makes the app, in the very early ages the app wouldn't be able to pay for the shipping. Especially if you're trading whole wardrobes, that could get pricey. It's a deal between two people, and whatever works out best for them. Again, sort of a use at your own risk."	sjvsgi	trans	574	0.99	2022-02-03 22:05:15

Girl, you look fantastic! I also love your cute purse!

HOW THE FUCK ARE YOU SO DAMN BEAUTIFUL
Beauty is in the eye of the beholder. I happen to be one of many who find you beautiful, but why do you care about my opinion anyway? Try not to. 😉 I rather YOU enjoy how YOU look. 😁
You pass better than I do. I'm envious. ☺ I always feel nervous that I'll get in legal trouble for going in the wrong bathroom or something, which is why I care.
Honestly you're beautiful but OMG I want those jeans!
Yes, absolutely!
Truly exceptional! I would have a second and a third look if I was in your vicinity. Hope you have a great Monday!!

Hopefully the hoodies too. Cuz a big hoody is amazing. I finally get why my wife always stole my guy ones.

Cute skirt!

Great! I can’t get things like that though :/ not yet anyways. My supposed over the knee socks don’t go over the knee because my legs are too big lol.
Gorgeous outfit!! You look fantastic. I adore the cute little handbag too!
Hell no it's to cold for skirts atleast where I live
I am hoping that HRT will help with this. Most of my leg size is muscle mass which I find repulsive. :/
I take it you're in North America. 300 weight thermal tights and two layers of bright stockings will take me comfortably down to -5C with a skirt like that where i live. But, having spent time in North America, i'd be the first to admit Berlin doesn't really know the meaning of cold!
I the mountains it can get down to -3F but it usually stays at 30 to 50F but I am a wuss in the cold so
I'm also a wuss in the cold. But i am also a cross country skier from 40 years back, so i know how to keep really warm with layers.💜"	lbkqky	trans	557	0.98	2021-02-03 10:27:48

fuck fuck fuck fuck what do I do? help!	"Tldr at the end

So my mom knew i wasn't feeling good the last... Idk 3 months? And today she went in my room when i wasn't home (wich she really never does normally) and found the empty package of my girly clothes. So when i cam home from school at my most exhausted moment she asked me what's wrong and what i ordered and i just said it was some merchandise. But she didn't stop she bombarded me with questions and then i started cry and didn't know what to say so i just started saying i don't want to talk about it. After a while she came to the conclusion that it had something to do with the LGBT community and hugged me and said she will always love me, i still didn't want to tell her so she said in the evening i should calmly tell her what's the problem. I don't know what to do. I haven't prepared anything and i don't know what to say. I'm not ready for this. Please help me!

Tl;dr: my mom knows I'm some part of the LGBT+ community and i have to tell her in about 2 hours. I'm not prepared and i don't want to do this. I feel like I'm dying. Actually i think it's a panick attack. fuck

Update: i said i didn't want to tell her for 30 minutes and now she is sure It's nothing really bad and said she can't  force me to say it😅 i just wasted the perfect opportunity and my mom probably thinks i don't trust her. Shit's rough I'm so dumb why didn't I just tell her"	"Just breathe and be honest. It seems like she is trying to understand and you got overwhelmed maybe because of exhaustion from school. I hope everything goes well for you! And just remember no matter what, somewhere, someone cares about you!
You could tell her you’re not ready, and you’ll tell her when you are.
Take it slow she is probably happy she knows what's going on with you just relax don't rush things I'm a year into my journey myself it's not a race it's a journey it's ok you are doing fine
Take a deep breath right now.

Your mother is probably worried and she's just trying to understand but it's completely okay if you don't feel ready to tell her. Try explaining that to her, saying you don't wanna talk about it and that you'll tell her when you feel ready. 
Try also to think about what scares you about telling her. It's your choice in the end when to come out.

Just remember, everything is going to be okay. If you need someone to talk to you can also DM me <3
You can still her tell. The window is never closed to sharing information if you want to. It comes down to when you want to share rather than a time you can only share.
Tell your mom you’re questioning your gender and you’d appreciate her trusting you and respecting your privacy. Reassure her you’re not going to hurt yourself, that’s probably her real fear since she’s supportive. Also? Your parents often “know” you’re the way you are, even if they don’t exactly know, because they raised you. If you can’t talk about it yet put it into a letter.
What makes you think that window is closed ? that is the dumbest excuse ever, sorry. Go to her right now, hug her and tell her. She already told you that she loves you no matter what, what else do you want ? A written invitation ?
You are going to be ok.
It's going to be okay,it might not seem this way right now but it's going to work out.
Take a deep breath and realize she's trying to be there for you. I'm a mom. She already knows. She's probably just waiting for you to open up about it.
There is NOTHING wrong with withholding information.
If you regret that you didn’t tell her, you can just like, tell her tomorrow. I GUARANTEE you that she will not, in fact, say that you missed your one chance to communicate with her and now you can’t tell her anything. She is curious! And clearly cares about you! You can choose when you want to talk and that includes saying you’ve changed your mind tomorrow and telling her. Or not! They are both fine options!
Seruously parents need to learn to give their kids privacy.

If my mom went through my stuff like that without asking. I would be so pissed.
I get the vibe that your mother is going to be accepting of you no matter what you tell her.

Her response to this is not one of a parent that would be hateful.

Just  take your time. And compose your self, you got this 💜
You'll be ok. I know it doesn't feel like it right now, but you'll be ok. The important thing to do right now is just to focus on your breathing. From experience, panic attacks are the absolute worst.


If you're not ready to come out to your mom, then just calmly say that you're not ready. Maybe say that you'll make sure to talk with her when you are, but you can't right now.


Alternatively, say ""fuck it"" and say something like ""I'm not ready to go further into details, but I'm trans. I'll talk to you about it later, ok?"" I'm not sure if that would work or be possible, but its an option. 


Either way, just remember that you'll be ok and everything will work out. I wish for the best for you.
I hear that you don’t feel ready.  Sometimes it’s hard to know when we’re ready and for somethings we never feel ready. This may be one of those moments when life has thrown in your path an opportunity to grow, and quite often growth is painful.

This probably won’t help, because you are on the other side of this experience, but the absolute hardest step is that first one. You can’t know for certain how your mom will react. In that absence of certainty, your mind will spin up vissions of the worst possible scenarios to keep you safe. I suspect you’ll feel tremendous relief once you’ve made it past those mental barriers.

In the end, you are in control of what you share with your mom and when. You may not know what to tell her, because you don’t have everything sorted for yourself, and that’s ok. You can tell her that. You don’t have to have everything figured out ahead of time. Again, you can’t know how she’ll react for certain, but she has expressed her love and support for you no matter what, so I suspect just knowing will put some of her fear and anxiety to rest. A mom’s worst fear is being shut out of her child’s life.
I don't know your home life but it seems like you have her support with everything. I know you don't feel ready but this seems like a golden opportunity to come forward with at least questioning.

Be safe much love.
Tell her.  She loves you and will probably be supportive no matter what.  I have a trans kid MtF.  They told me almost a year ago.  It hasn’t been easy.  The name change was the hardest to get used to.  But, I love them and support them no matter what.  Talk to your mom.
You didnt teller her, that s ok. You can do it now, just tell her what you just wrote here.
You should open up to your mum and tell the truth. She is obviously going to be supportive.
You can tell her through a letter or text, hide in your room for a few hours, and then act like nothing happened :D
Hey, commenting after the update, it's ok that you didn't tell her. You weren't ready to come out, and that's not something you can rush. Even if everything is in your favor, like accepting parents and friends, if you aren't ready, you aren't ready. One day, you will just feel more comfortable with the idea of coming out. Could be tomorrow, could be in a few years. You can't, and shouldn't have to, rush it.
Op if mum all ready knows and I'm guessing she dose as mum's intuition is spot on always, just asked her to go somewhere private to talk, I promise you you will have an ally and your depression and anxiety will dissolve x
She is obviously worried about you but the fact that she is giving you space implies its going to be ok.

If you don't feel ready to talk to her then reassure her its nothing she needs to be worried about.

How about writing a letter to her? That gives you time to clearly and concisely compose your thoughts.

Good luck but it sounds like it will be ok x
Maybe use a different method than direct. If you can't talk to her maybe write her a letter?  These things aren't easy
Print out a letter and leave it in your room for her to find while your at school. 

But actually tell her when your ready to. I found it easier to tell my wife by saying that I needed help, I want to talk to a therapist about my gender identity. For me this helped express that I was in pain and hurting, that this wasn’t just something spur of the moment and that it was serious.
You don’t need to commit to her with anything. The best thing IMO would be to express what you are feeling, even if it’s not prepared and is a jumbled mess. I had a whole speech prepared and as soon as I sat down with my parents it all went out the window because I couldn’t think straight. There is nothing wrong with telling her that you are trying to figure yourself out. It sounds like she loves you and will be supportive and it is freeing finally being able to be open honest with people. I also don’t think you wasted the perfect opportunity and she will probably make time for you whenever you are ready.
When YOU are ready. Do not let people pressure you.
""Hey mom, I understand you're very worried about me, but I'm not ready to talk about this yet. I am safe, and I'm not doing anything dangerous, I'm just dealing with something internal emotional and I haven't figured everything out just yet. I love you very much, and thank you for caring about me, but I'd appreciate it if you didn't force me to talk about this before I'm ready.""
Yolo. She's ready to listen. Take a Deep breath, remember nothing can ultimately keep you down, and go for it.
Hugs from a 44 yo trans mom. Big big hugs
one thing that’s helped me get through situations like this is i’ll tell someone i’ll tell them something to their face even if i don’t have the courage to say the thing itself yet, and then we kinda just sit there for a few minutes in silence while i try to gather the courage. you know what i mean? sometimes saying “i have something to tell you” can be a statement you make without committing to what you’re gonna say next, and that relieves the tension for me at least. it’s totally fine to back out afterwards too and i’ve done that a number of times. either way, usually they get part of the message and it becomes easier the next time around. hope this helps :)))

Fear is a fucker!
Be honest. It's not too late explain how you felt -tired etc and didn't mean to be evasive, scared unprepared etc. Reassure her - she seems accepting which is great and it is a lot for parents to process so reassurance and validation are key for a good coming out if you will.

 I came out to my mum first a couple of days after cracking the egg last December and 2 weeks later to my dad. I apologized to my dad for taking longer to talk with him, because I genuinely didn't know how he'd take it and I had minor anxiety around it. He was okay and understanding. Until I started presenting feminine in public that freaked him out. It's cool got past that now.
She sounds like a safe person to talk to. It’s scary as fuck. Maybe write her a note or a text if you can’t bring yourself to say it out loud. I’ll even write it here for you:
Hi mum/mom
I’ve been feeling uncomfortable in my assigned gender and I think I’m trans. I am still really nervous and raw about the whole situation and just want acceptance and love. Please call me [name] and refer to me as your daughter. 
So much love 
[name] ([deadname])

You haven’t wasted an opportunity to tell her. You can tell her any time. Just say you want to tell her something.
You have a mom that loves you and cares for you
It's not too late to turn it around and tell her anyway. It never will be. You can tell her and explain that you were scared and exhausted already and the sudden bombardment caught you off guard. I think you should tell her so that she can understand more fully how you're feeling. It's up to you in the end.
Just write it on a post it note if you don’t want to talk about it. That way she knows but gives her a chance to research about it and accept it in her own time instead of overwhelming you with questions
the perfect moment in which you decide to tell her its a big thing to tell someone
Sometimes it's just not the right time. You will come around to telling her, now just wasn't the time. You will find your moment, lovely human being.
This sounds so familiar, this is almost the exact same situation I had with my mum. She found my clothes and questioned but I would get upset and refuse to talk about it. 

She just decided to wait until I was ready which then took a silly long time. It certainly sounds like she’ll be accepting/supporting of you. 

I ended up backing myself into a corner, booked myself an appointment to get my hair done and then left the appointment out for her to see, ended up cancelling the appointment but at least it forced me out
Jump in. She’s not going to drown you.
I don't know when i am that's the problem i don't know anything and I'm fucked
Yeah can I get one?🥺
I am. And she said she was just getting my dirty clothes. idk it's not that bad but I'm still a bit pissed
This! Plus why be so demanding and upset if she’s such an ally? Wouldn’t someone who was cool w it be acting cool vs whatever the fuck she did?
You don’t have to know when you’ll be, you might not be ready for a whole year, but it’s good to set up that boundary since it seems to be worrying you so much, while also letting her know that she isn’t being completely blocked out by you.
""I'm fucked"" is a bit harsh. She seems to want to support and give you the love you need. Doesn't sound like she's going to punish you or be angry. 

A huge fear of a parent is their child keeping secrets that could lead to pain or harm. So she is probably just very concerned and wants to be there to help.
Dear Sara,
This is an official written invitation to come out to your mother. Reading through your replies, it seems like you really want to but you need a push. So here it is.
Sincerely,
Riley
Idk i don't think i can chicken out now she said she's really worried and wants do do it in the next few days :'(
I know but I'm just not ready i don't want to do that....
I agree with this dude your parent sounds like they want to respect you and stuff i would know bc my mother openly mocks me for being trans or at least attempting to be trans and hates anyone not heterosexual so I’m also fairly certain that she’s also against me being bi so based off of what you described your parent reacting you should fine
Hey, I get how stressful this is and it's okay to not be ready while also feeling like you're about to be forced to talk about it, because it is unfair that you're being pressured, even with good intentions. Try crossing your arms over your chest and patting your shoulders with the opposite hands one at a time to see if that helps your nervous system kind of come down because it's very activated right now. 

One of the things you can do to talk to your mom is to kind of talk around it. You don't have to tell her everything. You could tell her that you saw something you thought was cute and you're experimenting with how it makes you feel to dress in it but you're also dealing with embarrassment to the point where you don't really want to talk to her anymore than that, but you appreciate her support as you're learning to be comfortable in your own skin and with your identity. You can also tell her that you don't know where you fit in the LGBTQ sphere if she asks you to identify yourself with a label. Even if any of these things are technically lies, they're close enough to the truth to potentially satisfy what she wants without you having to come fully out until you're ready. 

Good luck! 🖖

Possible Trans Daughter/Son?	"Hello Sub! 
My 8 year assigned female at birth, has lately been saying they wish they were a boy. It’s not surprising and a piece a me has sort of known for awhile now (mother’s intuition). I’ve been reading books on the subject and trying. We’ve started going through their fashion choices and pick out clothes that make them feel more confident and have always encouraged hobbies regardless of their geared towards gender. I guess I’m wondering what words you wished you heard growing up about your identity? My child definitely seeks words of affirmation and I’d like to have some wonderfully affirming things in my back pocket. Just trying to be the best supportive parent I can.
Grateful to anyone who takes the time to read this!  
Edit: it’s almost 11pm my time and I have work in the morning. I’m trying to respond to each person in both my messages and comments. Thank you to everyone who’s called me a good mother, I’m trying but even I’m not perfect. There are still mornings where I have to yell “get your butt in gear or we’re going to be late!”  
R/trans, y’all are wild, I expected this to get like 2 whole comments. The support, ugh I can’t even my damn heart might explode.  


Edit 2: I woke up to so many supportive comments and messages this morning I’m still trying to go through them and reach out to each person who took the time to respond. Two wonderful websites were shared with me that so far seem great and frankly I wish I had them earlier. I just want to list the links just in case any other parents of cool kids stumble across this post.   
pflag.org  
mykidisgay.com"	"The most important thing you can do is let them know you will always love and support them no matter what, and encourage and support them exploring their gender to find what feels right. Be sure they know there’s no pressure, and you’ll love them whether they’re a girl or a boy or non-binary or agender or anything else. Knowing they have you there for them and helping them as they try to figure this out will make all the difference in the world.
Heck.  I don’t think you need advice.  I think you should give advice.  Sounds like you’re doing a great job. Just keep loving your kid no matter what name or pronouns they end up using. The world isn’t always kind.  They’re lucky to have a supportive mom.
I would add, and I’m guessing I don’t need to say this but, it’s also how you treat people other than your own child. Set an example. Never talk badly of others. Always show compassion. Keep an open mind. When they know you to be a kind sole, they will seek your counsel. Then simply be there with them in the moment. You’re doing great!
Sounds like you're already doing a great job. I think the best things you can say to them is that you'll always love and support them for who they are and whatsoever. They are lucky to have such a considerate mother!
I mean I know that people are always worried that their parents won’t accept them, which I get because my parents always seemed okay with trans people but were less okay when I was that trans people.  
There’s not a lot to help with that I suppose, but perhaps finding age appropriate media with trans people and talk about how you see them as strong and brave.  Like I know there are drag queens that read books to kids at libraries (or live streams or YouTube).  I don’t know a lot of child friendly media that has trans actors though.
Another idea could be using pretend play to explore their thoughts on it and show your support.  Like saying you’re going to play a pretend superhero game and they can pick any name they want, like __ or __ or __ , giving them typically male/female/neutral names.  Then support them with whatever they pick and have some fun.  I did this with kid at my UU church and asked them if they wanted to be the villian or the superhero and then what name they wanted and they immediately chose a name that was the opposite of their assigned gender.  
Speaking of UU, idk if you’re religious at all but UU churches are typically a safe and affirming place for gender nonconforming kids.  I was raised Catholic and switched to UU after experiencing transphobia at church.  So idk making sure that if you participate in religion that the religion is specifically accepting of gnc kids.
I'm not sure if you've done this with your kid yet, but you could always just sit down and talk to them about transgender people and what it means to be transgender. Giving your child the language to express how they feel is really important. Side note, it really warms my heart to see you being so open to your kid about this. You're doing a great job and I wish you the best :)
it makes me so happy to see loving parents. you are already doing so great believe me. the most important thing is being open and affirming which you already are. and you come here to ask a whole community! don’t hesitate to do so in the future, especially when you want advice and resources regarding the medical stuff. i wish you and your kid all the best 💖
Hi umm in my case I am the child. My mother usually knows a lot about me. And like you said ….mothers instinct ….. but she said that she never got any signals indicating that I am a “girl”!! FYI: she is pretty open minded so just wanna say that she is not transphobic or anything. 

I never told my mom when I was young and only at the age of 13 did I get some signs and I’m currently not sure also.
Try asking them about pronouns and name and seeing if they want to experiment with it.
You sound like you're doing the right things! I'm not a parent nor a parenting expert but I think just being supportive! You said your child seeks words of affirmation, so ask them what compliments they're comfortable with (for example, they might not like cute or they might prefer handsome - you know your child best so you might already know these things, just a suggestion!).
You sound like a great mother tbh
I started wishing I was a girl since 11. Turns out I’m trans! Doesn’t always mean their trans if they say that. I hear some of my friends who are girls say they wish they were guys because they liked the culture and privilege
Try to notice how you talk about other people who transition or are gender-non-conforming or what other people wear or act like. When I was a kid before I knew I was trans or came out my parents would talk about how people who got surgery were mutilating their body and that made me think that's how they would think I'd I came out (it kind of was how they thought - they've changed for the better now). In general, express tolerance and non-judgement for how anyone regardless of their difference to you acts, as long as their not hurting anyone. 

I would have appreciated also if my parents initiated hard conversations directly with me. Often they'd ask my sister behind my back, ""hey is x gay? Is x trans?"" And my sister would tell them that even if she did know, she wouldn't spill my secrets, and that my parents should talk to me directly if they were concerned. Even when I did come out, my parents especially my mom never really asked me what I wanted or needed or how they could help me or how they could be better learners, it was always up to me to have the hard conversations with them otherwise they'd awkwardly ignore the topic.

Show a personal commitment to apologizing when you get things wrong and being open to correction or conversation.

It sounds like you're already on the right track, and as long as you keep and open and willing to learn mind I think you'll do just fine:) I'm sure your kid already appreciates the love you show them
I wish I had learned about trans people when I was growing up. My family is supportive, but I wasn't taught about these things and happened to manage to not encounter it in the wild, so I never knew it was possible to be anything other than what I was born as. Took me 20 years to find my true self as a result
Other commenters already covered pretty much everything I was going to say but a have a few recommendations 

Jack not Jackie- picture book about a trans boy

Ridley Jones- kids show with a canon non-binary main character (Fred the bison)

And if you're a reader I suggest ""Being Jazz: My Life as a (transgender) Teen"" it's an autobiography and a good book about growing up transgender. It's really insightful but it's definitely a book for you and not your kid lol :)
gratz on the boy
Better parenting than most people here received mate...keep it up!
If your 8yo does say he's trans dont ask him questions please 
I get really scared when someone that is cis asks me about trans because even doe im trans i wanna be treated like every female i dont anna be that transgender girl i just wanna be that girl so its really scary and dysphoric when soeone starts asking me questions
You’re doing a great job and I wish my mom had let me express myself this way when I was growing up. I would just let your kid know that no matter you love them and let them continue expressing themselves the way they feel fit. With clothes, hair, activities etc. 
Maybe ask them if they would prefer to be called handsome instead etc. 

But other than that I don’t think you need to have any sort of talk with them. I’m sure they’ll figure it out on their own. Just knowing you love and support them will be enough 💕
No matter my age I’d want my parents and other family members to listen and be open, and to explore trans topics, for example through reading, watching films/documentaries, attending PFLAG or other groups, etc.
I'd say keep doing what you're doing. Don't rush into it, but I can say that I'm almost 100% sure that she's gonna end up as a he for at least a little while at some point. (Trying out the pronoun, I mean.) Ever since I was 4 I've been saying those things, and now I'm living full time as myself.
i was very similar as a kid- in terms of affirmation, and experimenting, vary the terms you use to compliment them!! when i was little, hearing that i looked handsome boosted me like nothing else. they’re lucky to have a parent like you in their corner :)
 
edit- also try and speak kindly of others- hearing my parents say transphobic things in passing prevented me from coming out to them for several years, despite knowing they would still love me. the things you say affect your little ones!! i wish you and your kid happiness and health :^)
I'm glad ur a supportive parent just tell ur kid that they're valid and u love them for being who they are make sure to respect their pronouns and name choice also try not to comment on their body like if they shaved before and they stop shaving don't mention anything about it unless they bring it up honestly u seem like ur doing fine as is just keep telling them they have your support thru their transition and ull do fine
Even being knowledgeable on the subject is amazing and a huge step. Your kid is lucky whether they’re trans or not <3 everyone else has said this but really just letting them know you’re here for them and having open conversations about it is good. Remember that this is about them not you, even though you might be inclined to don’t remind them of what they’ll have to go through if they’re trans, just keep it positive. Oh and use they/them pronouns until they let you know what they rather!
I absolutely love when parents come here to seek knowledge to help their children. No one is perfect, but being this supportive means that whatever mistake you make is made in genuine good faith. 

When your child grows up, they will remember that you encouraged and supported them from the start. If they do come out as trans/ non binary/ any other gender identity, your staunch support will make all the difference.

I like the idea of letting your child picking the clothes that make them feel more comfortable. Let them explore at their pace, maybe put them in contact with a therapist specialised in LGBTQ+ care? 

Also, be prepared to defend your child from people who say stuff like ""a lady should..."" And ""a good girl should..."". I hate that kind of stuff with a *passion*. If anyone said anything of the sort to my child, be assured that the knives would come out!
You're handling this like a champ. Only advice is tell them often how much you love them. Affirm their choices. Let them cycle through labels and just show you're trying. 

That's all any kid wants. You're doin' great
""No matter what, I won't judge you"" is something I think would be nice.
Knowing that you are there for them and will support them no matter their choices is the best thing you can do. Just let them take it at their own pace with no pressure.
No one is perfect and everyone can and will make mistakes, but as long as you are there to love and support them will be plenty to help them through.
You're doing great I'm sure, and this has made my day to read. Keep up the good work!
i fucking wish you were my mom, one of the best moms right here
I always recommend that parents of trans people go to PFLAG or some similar group for families. Your best resource is usually other parents of trans people. There is much misinformation on the internet, unfortunately.

https://pflag.org/
You've gotten tons of great advice already, just wanted to say that it's lovely you've supported your kid this way. Whoever they decide they are will be okay in the end because they have you.
You already seem like your helping them really well just remember to tell them it's ok to be a boy a girl or something in the middle and that you'll love them no matter what
Well what do you need advice in?
Please let them know youre supportive all the way through. As someone who is FtM my biggest regret was not telling my parents sooner out of fear of rejection. If i had told them sooner i couldve gotten on puberty blockers (which are totally reversable dw) and that wouldve saved me a lot of money and pain.
Ask them questions. Ask about what their experience is like. Ask clarifying questions. Your child will be the utmost expert on what they're going through, and at least for me, someone being invested and actively wanting to talk to me about it would have been amazing. It's often easy to say ""you can talk to me about anything"" but making the effort to reach out can still be really hard for kids (and adults)
That you'll love them no matter what, now or later whatever decisions they make to help themselves feel happy will make you happy too. My parents always bring up so many what ifs about my life later on, when for 18 years I've been miserable and I care about now. The best you can do is let them know you love them.
100% upvoted, new record
Maybe its in here, this is a lot to scroll, has the actual term come up? My house hold was pretty open sexually growing up and yet I STILL never heard of the term transgender/ transsexual which gave me a LOT of un needed anxiety!
I’d suggest asking your child if they want to be referred to as a boy and if they want a boy name instead. If your child feels more comfortable with this try using son and he/him pronouns. Be sure to let your child know even if they don’t feel like a guy at some point you’ll be there and help them thru their adventure.
Thanks! I’m trying, they’re still a kid so when I say I love you no matter what I get “ugh mom, I know!”. I appreciate you taking the time.
Definitely this. I know there are a lot of adult trans folx here who wish their parents were this supportive from the start. Myself included. So yeah, you’re on the right track. Keep learning, and buckle up. This will be such an amazing growth experience for both of you which will hopefully be another way for you to bond, rather than forcing you apart. But just remember that’s because of you and how you’re choosing to respond with love here. That’s huge. Thank you for doing what not all parents are able to do.
I understand completely. I grew up in a weirdly religious household and wasn’t really told the basic things like “I love you” as a kid. It’s why I struggle with it now as an adult and am looking for ways or examples I can use since I’m not great with it.
Thank you, this is some great advice. I’m not a raging Karen but I probably could be kinder to others (truthfully with the rona we’re not out as much and interacting with others). Regardless I should probably be more mindful about my actions.
Finding age appropriate media with great trans characters is a STRUGGLE. We have a trans neighbor who we like a ton and always chat with (we love her dog). But I’m not sure if I’d bring up “ya know Liz was born a boy”, because we’ve just always known them as our sweet neighbor Liz and I don’t want to negate how they want themselves viewed. When I was pregnant I was convinced I was having a boy and so they lucked out with a gender ambiguous name at birth. But I like that idea of almost gender roleplaying when we’re doing legos and stuff. I’m a pagan weirdo these days so we don’t really participate in organized religion but that warms my heart that you found a congregation that was so welcoming and loving.
I’ve tried to have a pretty basic conversation with them. “Sometimes people are just born in the wrong body ….. etc”. I’m new to this (trans identities) and am just learning the right language myself! But honestly giving them the tools to explain how they’re feeling is important. I’m just going to have to figure out how to do that. 😅
This is pretty new for us, my kid has been a tomboy for awhile and recently told me they wished they were a boy. So while I don’t have any problems with things like hormone blockers I’m going to let it ride until they tell me they want something like that (though I’m going to start to educate myself on how to give them the language to express it like another commenter suggested!) So far this sub has been so wonderful with this post. I expected like 5 people tops would comment on it. Y’all are great <3
I’m glad you have an open minded parent! I don’t know if they’ll stick with this or not but I just didn’t want to take the chance that this was a “phase” and brush off who they are as a person. If they change their mind next week or in 5 years I’ll roll with it too. Gender is super fluid so it’s okay to not be sure! It also doesn’t help that for so long we’ve “gendered” basic interests like baking or automotive interests instead of letting kids be kids. I’m not sure how old you are but I really didn’t get a firm grasp of who I was as a person until my mid 20’s and even now sometimes it changes!
We have! They really like they/them. I’ve been trying to be very consistent with it for a couple months now (the conversation came up just after thanksgiving)
And also what words to describe in general. Do they prefer to be called your child? Your son? Do they still like daughter? What about... I dont know the word, names... I know I always loved ""kiddo"" because it was so gender neutral, stuff like that. These things should be discussed and implemented when possible :]
We haven’t discussed genders in depth yet, at this point we’re at “how can we feel best about ourselves” and right now that is mostly choice to dress more masculine. Whatever they pick I’ll roll with it.
We have a neighbor we see often (my kid loves her dog) who is Trans. She’s one of the few non-nutjobs in my “conservative” area so we get along well. Always treated her with the kindness and respect that we try to show anyone.
There’s tons of queer folk in my life but besides my neighbor (who I like but I wouldn’t say we’re besties), I don’t have a lot of trans people in my life which is why I turned to this subreddit.
And I’ll try and do the hard conversations. When I enrolled them in pre-k it’s like a switch got flicked in their brain and suddenly they became a “tomboy”. This past thanksgivingish they divulged to me that they wanted to be a boy. We discussed that sometimes people are just born in the wrong body, and that when I was pregnant I was convinced they were going to be a boy so maybe that was just the case. They agreed and thought that was it and we’ve just started this. So this is quite new for me and I’ll have to suck it up and learn how to have those hard talks.
Another commenter had messaged me privately with the title of a great book about gender identities so it’s on my list. Truthfully I don’t think my kid knew trans was an option either. A couple of months back when we were just spending time they mentioned that they just wished they were a boy because they didn’t feel like a girl. After some conversations we’ve rolled with it. Unfortunately we don’t know a whole lot of trans folks and age appropriate media with trans characters has been a struggle to find. Another commenter mentioned giving them language tools to help describe what they want with their gender so I’ve got to start educating myself on just how to be their true self.
Thanks! Love ‘em no matter what!
This is a wonderful suggestion! I’ll admit I struggle to keep the questions to a minimum, at 8 they just don’t have the language tools. I’ll try and be a more mindful of how I ask questions and how often.
Another commenter also suggested the use of the word “handsome” and I feel like a bonehead for not thinking of it earlier. Now that two people independently suggested it, it just confirms that it’s a great idea!
I’m not someone who speaks poorly about transpersons, I did go through a bit of a man-hating kick so I’m definitely going to have to make sure I chose my words carefully and not say anything of the matter around them.
They’re not quite at that age yet but I will def keep that in mind, thank you!
We talked pronouns and they chose they/them. We’ve been trying to consistently use em for a couple of months now.
I recently booked an appointment but it’s MONTHS out for excepting new patients and it seemed like younger kids might be stuck towards the bottom of the totem pole in terms of priority. Which is okay in our case, they aren’t in a household where they have to worry about their safety.
I’m trying to let them take the reigns. Just absorbing a lot of the wonderful websites and resources people have given.
Hello sorry I’m not super great at Reddit. I just updated my post. I would just like to know what words you heard or might have been told that were reaffirming to your identity? Also Dang! Thanks for the fast reply.
No I haven’t used the term transgender/transsexual yet. This is still pretty new for me and we just started on how to make them more comfortable in their own body. I don’t know a whole lot about gender identities (yet) but I’ve got messages with a ton of books for me to pick up and read. Once I can get a better understanding we’ll start using the technical terms. I just don’t want to throw out the wrong terminology and possibly confuse them.
Well that’s kids for you. :) but remember that you can show them that love by just supporting them. If they want to try different clothes, or hairstyles, or pronouns, or names, if they see you helping them do that every step of the way, the love will come across.
Thanks! I’m really trying. Having a small person is tricky and I just don’t want to screw them up.
Yeah.  That’s also what I grew up with too. I’d say then just don’t over do it.  Sometimes worrying about saying the right thing, or doing the right thing, especially when you didn’t grow up with a good example of what that looks like it can cause you to overcompensate.  When I was eight I would have wanted to be loved and treated like any other eight year old boy.  I’d say maybe just try out using he for them randomly.  If they smile real big you might have a son.
Yeah telling your kid that your neighbor is trans would be weird unless Liz wanted that to happen.  Have you talked to her about your kid at all? She might have some ideas too, or want to share her story with them.  

There’s a book on Amazon that’s 3+ called Who Are You that’s a gender identity guide for kids[here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/1785927280/ref=cm_sw_r_cp_api_glt_i_183JBEZXGW6QYJ03A29N?_encoding=UTF8&psc=1)
I bought it for a friend who said her kid was going through something similar and she said it was great. 

Not surprised to hear you’re pagan at all.  Like half the people at my church, including the religious Ed director, are pagan, and they’re all so accepting and amazing.
I'm really glad to hear that, it sounds like you're doing everything you need to be doing. It makes me so happy to see people like you doing this kind of thing.
It should definitely be their choice, yes - but it may also be a good idea to mention it in case they don't know those exist. I'd also make sure they know that if they want to be a boy, they can be. It's distressingly common how often trans kids don't know they can be trans and so just have feelings of ""I wish I could be [x], too bad I can't""
of course! there is no rush and there is also no „requirement“ to do anything medical at all if your child does not want to - as long as they know their options and all the consequences. some of my friends who are trans did not transition medically at all. there is also a lot in between being a trans woman or trans man. I identify as non binary despite being read as a man now - there really is no right way to be trans. this journey does not have to be a tragic one, it can be pretty exciting and liberating for everyone involved. you sound like a very considerate person to me :)
That was really helpful. I am 17 years old. As of now I was planning to tell my mom about my other mental health issues and I actually feel kinda angry that my mom didn’t catch this because she knows me well and during the pandemic I stopped doing everything and I really felt that she should have know but nonetheless what happened happened. As of now I am planning to just tell her I want professional help from a therapist or something. A general therapist and then I eventually maybe if I get comfortable with them I’ll tell them about my gender. 

If it’s possible can I chat with you about something? I need advise from someone who is a parent.
They like being called gremlin lol. As they’re discovering themselves and choosing to dress more masculine I’ve just been saying something generic like “cool outfit”. I hadn’t really thought of using “gendered” adjectives like handsome. That is a really great idea!
It will be hard (hence the name hard convos) but I promise those convos will be worth it. Your kid will feel supported and listened to, you'll learn more about all this trans stuff and about how to help your kid, and it will draw you two closer. And you'll show that you can handle potential awkwardness and you won't let that awkwardness or lack of knowledge you may have be a barrier in living your child. 

And if you have a trans neighbor, maybe invite her for dinner sometime? Ask if she's comfortable talking to your kid and being a support who may know a little of whatever they're going through. It could be good to ask the other queer people in your life too, they may not know trans stuff specifically but they will know stuff about possibly realizing you're queer and exploring identity and supporting one another.

I wish you the best of luck and I hope your kid can see how much you love them, because we on this subreddit can definitely tell <3
Oh another good thing I think, is when/if you meet other LGBT people is to ask for pronouns, etc. It will be something that your kid will pick up on, and they’ll know that their parents are a safe space and support the community.
That's alright I'm glad I could help I'm also glad they're gunna grow up with such a supportive parent most of us trans/non-binary kids aren't as lucky so it's nice and refreshing to see a parent making an effort
thats great! i'm glad they're comfortable enough to talk about that with you
Probably just that you love  them and that no matter who they are you will support them. Maybe ask if they’d like to use he/him pronouns for a bit to try it out?
Thats fair, certainly a balance! Good luck, you seem to have quite a handle on this situation ♡
I’m certainly not the expert on this, but I’d guess it’s pretty close to impossible to raise a child to adulthood without some bumps along the way. You’re going to screw something up, no matter how hard you try or how pure your intentions are. But the difference is, those screw ups are things you can work through together, instead of allowing them to fester and have more long-term negative effects. As long as you approach even those obstacles with the same love and tender humility this post displays, you’re setting yourself AND your child up for a much happier and mutually beneficial relationship—through their whole life. Which is such a beautiful thing many trans children (and just children in general) are unfortunately denied.
I’m definitely going to get that book! While we like Liz enough to say help her shovel her driveway but I’m not that close. And I’ll admit I might feel weird just being like “hey Liz! I know your trans, talk to my kid about it!”. It might just be the background I grew up in, where if you were different you kept that to yourself so I feel strange diving that deep into someone’s personal business, ya know?
I hope that it works out! You sound like a wonderful parent!
Probably the best idea
They recently said they liked the “they/them”. I still slip up on occasion (old habits die hard) but I’m really trying. Every time I’ve got to toss a quarter in the swear jar so I feel I’ll break the habit hopefully soon since I’m making a conscious effort.
maybe instead of asking something that direct just open up about your struggles to her? like, don't ask for help just talk to her. that will leave it to her, if she wants to get involved or help.
It sounds like you’re doing amazing. You are a good parent"	sb8rv9	trans	534	0.99	2022-01-24 00:43:30
It’s crazy how much I used to hate going clothes shopping... now I love it!! 😁❤️		"I always look at the eyes in before and after pics. You can always see the sort of ""dead inside"" feeling in the before picture, while the after is always beeming and joyful! Very happy for you.
Pretty dress! And I'm the same way. I still get nervous shopping for women's clothing, but I enjoy it when I feel perfectly safe. Men's clothing I was Infamous in my family for hating shopping.
Beautiful! And same here 🙂
We can all tell from your SMILE which way you like it better!  ❤️
I can relate to this so much!! Love your dress
U definitely look happier in the 2020 pic😘!
I completely understand and agree with that, and I'm still pre-everything (undergoing evaluation currently)
That dress is super cute and looks great on you ❤
Ahhh you're so pretty!!!
Miraculous change....a caterpillar to a butterfly
Gorgeous! 😻 And yes, shopping is truly one of my favorite activities now, once things get back to normal. 💜
Yup, same.  Never really got excited for clothes shopping before.  It was a total chore.  Now, I probably spend too much time and money doing it. 🙄😁

Also doesn't help that men's clothes just never fit me.  I was buying boys sizes well into my teens.  Pants were either too long, or the waist was too wide.  Finding my size was a chore.  Now, it's like women's size 3-5, and they fit perfect.
You look great!! That new hairstyle is bomb on you!! 💛💛
Cute!!!
Something i noticed too in my own selfies, recently looks as if there's a sparkle of life in my eyes
I see this in all my old selfies too."	g1awor	trans	524	1.0	2020-04-14 18:25:24
feel kinda bad not going to lie.. everyday I wake up try some make up and feminine clothing.. but I just feel disappointed. Hope with hrt this feeling goes away.		"Sis, your gorgeous and I can't wait until you can feel like the queen you are yourself.
I think you're absolutely gorgeous
you'll feel better some day soon sweetheart ❤️
Once you start on HRT, you will in a few months come alive. Don't except immediate results, but the changes will come.
You are cute!!
You look great Sis, keep at it!
you look amazing! I have no doubts HRT will only make you more beautiful.
You look beautiful hope all goes well
You’re already passing in my eyes and looking great! :3
""practice makes perfect"" is applicable to make up skills as well ;) Just keep it up and you will see progress sooner than you'll expect :\*
I’m drinking the gender fluid
You're awesome and gorgeous girl, hopefully it comes sooner than later for you! I'm in the same boat waiting for hrt but I'm looking at bridging medication perhaps that could be an option for you also.
O: i genuinely wish i passed like u
Uh, you're doing great. Cute as hell, keep doing whatever you're doing.
You look great and you're valid
Yeah shmood
Beautiful lips very much kissable, especially if you leave your mouth open!
This is exactly how I feel but I’m nervous to start hrt but than not at all I just think I’m scared to ask and I feel like I’ll disappoint people
Hang in there you are beautiful and keep being you 💞💞💞🌈
I’ve been on hrt for about six years and I still feel pretty bad about myself sometimes, but trust me when I say this; it absolutely gets better pretty girl, you definitely don’t have anything to feel disappointed or feel bad about. You’re gorgeous hun~ 💕💕💕
you're already hot.
I looked at your profile, and I’m gonna be honest I’m kind of offended. 

I don’t want to tell you you don’t belong here, that’s 100% not my place, but maybe make a different profile where you post to subreddits for “Traps” “Tgirls” and “Straighttosissy” because it seems as though you’re fetishizing the fuck out of us
Omg you are so cute
Very pretty
Hey beautiful
Hey preety
Hey beautiful
You're beautiful, sweetheart <3
Have a real good think about the HRT and do what makes you happy. Live your best life
God I felt that. You look very pretty though, especially your hairrrr, and I like your dress? Top? I can't tell cause of the angle but I like the simplicity and color
You look great
Practice in the mirror, ignore that Voice. Be Who You Want To Be. Become Happy with it. Sometimes just lookoing at yourself and portraying the part; uncomfortable as it may seem is the key to unlocking the You that You Desire.
🥺 thanks 🙁
Thanks 🥰
Hopefully 😇🥰
I hope so
💖
I'll try my best 🥰
I hope so 🥰, thanks!
Thank you so much ❤
Thanks 🥰

WAIT is that a skirt??? I CANT TELL- I like the frilly Lacey looking bit wijdjdjwbdnrnr

I’ve been having dreams about being like one month on hrt and I’m super happy in them I feel confident and like it’s the true me in my brain trying to get out lol

Wbu ? Are u doing hrt aswell?
😅😅 I hope we both can get it then 😘
I'm not totally sure about it yet
Me neither, but I'm 90% maybe.. 

But it's a very hard decision
Yea I'm still kinda just idk contemplating"	ptjomd	trans	519	0.99	2021-09-23 00:33:36
Got into an argument with my wife about the new Harry Potter game…	"Have y’all seen the new game? It looks amazing. 

And JK is a fucking TERF. 

Background: I’m genderqueer, present male, and would like to wear more feminine clothing. I have confessed my non-binary gender identity to my wife. She understands. She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

So I spoke to my wife about how incredible the new game looks and how it seems to deliver on all the delight and promise inherent within the Harry Potter universe, but I’m torn because I don’t want my delight in the game to support a TERF who already uses her wealth and influence to try to make it harder for people to express their gender identity. 

She said she doesn’t care about all that, and the hate for JK is just twitter rage. She decided I didn’t know anything about it all, and I should just be quiet about it. 

I walked away. 

She came back, told me she read JK’s 2020 essay full of dog-whistle rhetoric and said she agrees with 90% of the points. 

I don’t dispute that women need exclusive safe spaces. I don’t dispute that women are disproportionately the victims of abuse. 

Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a *woman* (emphasis hers), can decide what’s best for women. And that *men*, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women. 

Wife proceeds to bring up a bunch of TERF-ish  talking points supporting her position, which I calmly refuted with sources, and she just blew me off. I’m incapable of understanding, you see, because I’m a man. 

We have 2 trans kids. She’s supportive of them, but they’re FtM. She asserts that the current trend (her words) of girls transitioning to men is because it’s not safe to be a girl in our society. Okay. 

My wife has made it very clear that she’s not going to be my ally. My internal life seems like it will have to stay private unless we split up. I suppose that’s sort of a gift.

--------------------

Edit: This blew up in a way I didn't anticipate. Rather than responding to every one of you delightful and concerned individuals who are overwhelming me with support, my wife and I have been negotiating around the edges of divorce for a while now. Issues like this, among myriad others, make it clear that we're not terribly compatible, and things have likely run their course. It's just a matter of figuring out how to end things amicably with minimum impact for the kids (2 mentioned in the post, and a few more...)"	"Your wife is forcing you to stay closeted for her comfort, you have bigger problems than HP, you need an actual divorce.
that's a genuinely kind of fucked up situation to be in. your wife is being extremely dismissive and transphobic to your kids and you, putting her comfort & love of JKR over you all and using TERF bullshit to justify her bigotry. i'm sorry you're in the thick of it. you and your kids deserve better.
I’m a woman and I agree with you.  Women of every flavor deserve to use women’s spaces.  JKR and her legion of terfs are doing the same thing to trans women that white women did to black women during the suffragette movements and it’s disgusting.  Anyone that agrees with anything she has to say is literally siding with white conservative men against other women.  All of those terf talking points are straight from conservative think tanks that are actively trying to strip women’s bodily autonomy.

I’ll gladly sup on their transphobic tears as our trans siblings get more acceptance, rights, and protections.  They will look just like any other hate organizations in the eyes of history.  Children will look back on them with utter disdain and disgust just like we do with the KKK now.
So ah... you need a divorce.

You're wife is bigoted, infantalizing her FtM trans kids, invalidating your identity, and actively keeping you in the closet for her own comfort. There's no salvaging this. You need to make arrangements to split.
Your wife just told you she’s a TERF, but she has a trans spouse and two trans kids? And she calls you a man & claims your kids are part of a ‘trend?’ You’re being forced into the closet and your wife doesn’t believe you or your kids are who you say you are, please get out of there and find a partner who actually cares about your guys’ identities.

edit: spelling
D I V O R C E

Your wife cannot possibly be loving and supportive of you OR your trans kids. She needs a TON of work on herself, TONS of learning and reconditioning...literal years of self reflective ego work, and effort...thats all IF she realises she needs to do it all... Unlikely, seeing as the best way to change someones mind is from the position of good/loving friend/partner, and she is unable to change her mind or understand why she needs to.

Once more... 

D I V O R C E
You have 2 trans boys as kids. You NEED to protect those children from your TERF wife, and I'm sorry, but your wife is a TERF. I hate jumping to ""divorce her"", but this woman is ACTIVELY harming you and your kids with these beliefs. Your duty, as a trans parent to trans children, is to model good behavior and good morals. That means bouncing TERFs out of your life for their protection. You know how dangerous rhetoric like that is. I'm sure you know the suicide risk for kids who don't have supportive parents, and that still stands even if one is a transphobe. By staying with her, you're showing your children that it's okay to have these beliefs, and it WILL harm them.  

For your children's sakes, and your sake, GET OUT. She doesn't deserve to be a mother if she thinks your kids think it's a trend. Your kids deserve better, and so do you. Get. The hell. OUT. If for no other reason than your kids' lives are at risk living with a TERF.
First, your wife is transphobic and you should definitely rethink your relationship for the safety of you and your kids. Second, I was also excited about the game, but I found out that in addition to a neo nazi being heavily involved in dev, the plot is about the goblin rebellion and you get a house elf…IDK if I want to play it now knowing the weirdly racist parts of original HP that have now been recognized as problematic are put in such focus. Just my two cents, would love to hear what you think on the matter.
you need to not be with her to be yourself and she clearly doesnt respect your kids either. it's sad there's people like her
you deserve to be however you are and want to be as do your kids.
your wife is very clearly a terf and not actually supportive or you or your kids. i’m so sorry- focus on protecting your mental health and that of your kids over all else.
Tbh just do you. If she can't handle it that's her problem and she isn't the one, she sounds like an icky person anyway
You need a divorce ASAP. Sounds like her beliefs can be harmful to your children.
Get. A. Divorce.
I'm so sorry to see this and your edit. Sending you so much love, support and solidarity ❤️🖤
I think for the mental health of not it’s you and your trans kids, but the rest of your kids who might be gender non conforming or queer in any way, you should probably get a divorce.

My parents aren’t accepting of me at all, and it’s driven me to some very dark thoughts. Don’t let your wife put your kids in that position. 

Good luck either way though :)
Don't let your wife dissuade you from presenting as female. If she wants, she can fuck right off. She's already shown what kind of person she is: a TERF! She's putting her bs ahead of your happiness.
If she agrees with JK then she’s not supporting her kids
Sorry but your wife can screw off. I dont have patience or sympathy for her or people like her.
I take it that if your children were MtF she wouldn't be be very supportive of them... The problem here definitely lies with her not only being transphobic, but also quite sexist, too. And for her to dismiss anything that you say, while everything she says is automatically correct definitely reminds me of my transphobic parents.
Obviously everyone here is saying to get a divorce, but I personally wouldn't take an action like that immediately. Not saying that you won't have to eventually, but you might want to try other options first.
Fuck J.K. Rowling and fuck anyone who agrees with her.  
I’m so sorry, OP.
Leave her leave her leave her.

She’s a TERF and TERFs aren’t safe spouses or parents for trans folks. Keep an eye on the kids too.
I would also point to JK’s recent support to a trans and homophobic woman called Caroline Farrow who refuses to acknowledge her trans son and refers to him as her daughter. Also Caroline Farrow who has tweeted about hating homosexuality as it’s a sin and is against the non-biblical rainbow. But then supports lesbians because of the trans lesbians out there. 

There are some awful people out there and unfortunately it sounds like your wife is one of them. I feel sorry for your sons having a mother like that. I also seen your edit about the possibility of divorce. I think you do need to seriously consider that and get your sons away from that woman
I don't want to be extremist, but leave her, she is forcing you to stay miserable so she can go on with her stupid fragile nonsense ideologies.
Based on your last sentence, it seems like you're already in the decision to end things with her. If she doesn't support you and eventually won't support your children (judging by the examples of her personality in this post), I would also suggest looking at getting out of the relationship. 

People forget that as humans, we are evolving and changing creatures. We need and deserve to surround ourselves with those who will only add something good to our lives, especially those who are minorities of any degree. Your happiness, mental wellbeing and development are much more important than a relationship where you already sound limited and discontent.

Of course, this is all only judged from this post alone. No matter your choice in the end, OP, I only wish you happiness.
honest advice. I think you should rethink your relationship to someone who is unwilling to support you, and understand your struggles. if you decide to stay, I wish you the best on this, as terfs are usually unable to listen to reason, and seem to be more focused on fighting already oppressed groups than fighting the establishment
Some other Harry Potter things worth knowing about... https://youtu.be/-1iaJWSwUZs )
>Wife told me that she agrees with JK because wife, as a woman (emphasis hers), can decide what’s best for women. And that men, again emphasis hers, pointing at me, cannot possibly understand the concerns of women.

Tell her that as a \*trans\* person, you know what's best for trans people. And that \*cis\* people, point at her, can't possibly understand the concerns of trans people.
I would watch [James Somerton's](https://youtu.be/xLuNGhQPDHM) video on Rowling. She doesn't get paid in royalties from any of the HP franchise products and instead gets a large lump sum as payment up front. 

As such the only harm done is to the game company that signed on to make the game well before Rowling began making transphobic comments. It sucks for them because this was the sink or swim game for them so they couldn't just drop the game.

The company making the game as such has done what they can to distance themselves from Rowling and she's had no input on the game at all. 

Because of that I am ambiliviant on people buying it. On one hand not buying it helps to move the current zeitgeist away from the HP series and in doing so moves Rowling and her veiws away from being seen as relevant. On the other hand a trans positive small game company may very well suffer because Joanne chose to be a bigot after the game was already well into development. 

I lean towards the former as the game will likely do well enough despite people boycotting it but knowing what I know I'm not going to be too harsh on people buying it because a trans positive company is potentially invaluable in it's own right.

Edit: Oh yeah, your wife sounds like she's found herself on the GC pipeline. I'm sorry that your wife is not being supportive and has fallen for gc propaganda.

 Hopefully, you can get through to her with the resources others have provided but if not or if she further ingratiates herself in the GC ~~cult~~ movement then it may not be safe for your sons and yourself.

Given the horrid things gc's say to the cis parents of trans children to try and turn them against their children I would be worried.

 [Calien Conrad](https://youtu.be/pwI6py78gsI) is in the process doing a 3 part deep dive in how gc's do their recruitment and indoctrination and it's honestly eye opening. It's long but it's worth setting aside the time to watch. Best of luck with your spouse.
You deserve someone so much more accepting
Wow this escalated quickly. So you are telling me that your wife not only doesn't view you as any different from a cis man but also your sons as daughters who basically hide from a life as a woman? 
I'm very sorry but you really need to evaluate whether this marriage can have any kind of future. This doesn't sound like a healthy environment for you and your children.
Your wife by the sounds of this doesnt deserve you or your sons.
If she cant handle the way you'd like to present, she isn't a good wife. I'm so sorry. 

Get those kids out of there too.
I have to be honest, this sounds like an incredibly toxic environment. Y'all need to either get some counselling  because that is not an okay situation. And if she's not willing and able to make a change then you owe it to yourself, your kids and even her to end it.
It really seems like she doesn’t know any trans women besides Caitlyn Jenner, and the only picture of trans women “out there in the world” she thinks much of are  those “hulking predatory men,” without realizing we’re just like her. Sending us into the mens room doesn’t keep her any safer, it just puts us in harms way so she can have peace of mind. I hope one day she’ll realize how harmful her mindset is, and officially barring trans women from women’s spaces doesn’t stop or reduce predatory men from forcing themselves in anyway. I’m really sorry you and your kids are having to deal with this in the meantime.
So sorry. Wife is wrong, completely wrong and bigoted. Her reasoning seems completely crooked, ftm yes mtf no?! Like sorry..??? I would almost think she just has this opinion because she doesn’t want you to change. She will never get away with this once your kids grow up and understand what happened...
While everyone else is commenting on the obviously more important issue of your wife’s bigotry, here’s my two cents on less important issue about the game. If you get a used copy you won’t be financially supporting JKR, that’s my plan.
You definitely can’t not transition for her. Even if you don’t go nuts, you’ll resent the hell out of her. My wife and I had a lot of talks and tears. It can work out. Don’t give up hope.  Maybe try counseling?  The kiddos make it worth a shot. 

And on the game, idk, if it gets good reviews then I’ll probably get it.  lots of people other than JK will get $ off the purchase. The gender options seemed a little tone deaf to me. I was thinking about rolling a Female Wizard, as I understand it that means you’ll look like a girl but will room with the boys. It’d be sort of a reflect off howI felt and lived all throughout school.
Mmmm kinda sounds like Misandry and a lot of transphobia coming from her. I’m not one to offer relationship advice but I seriously believe you guys should sit down and discuss your relationship. Only reason I don’t say divorce right away is because obviously you two love or loved each other at some point and that’s why you’re married so speaking on the same level may give you insight into the next step which sadly might just be divorce anyway ;-;

But do not tolerate this behavior from her. If she truly believes all of this, they you’ll just have to say “I’m sorry, I’m not the person for you and you’re not the person for me.”
I have similar problems with my girlfriend. We met before I started my transition and I’m constantly having to prove myself. What I noticed is that she will never really understand and I don’t need to deal with that. I know it must be hard having two children with her and being married is entirely different challenge but please ask yourself if you are safe yourself. The last thing you want is to be hiding yourself because of someone else’s wishes. Regardless of your relationship status or being a parent you need to be yourself unapologetically ❤️❤️❤️
Maybe try couples therapy, if not I think you two are just not too well suited for each other at this point in your lives and it's time to move on :/
Regarding the game, I agree. I've heard that there are ways to _get_ a game without paying for it, especially if you're on PC, but I wouldn't know more about that of course *wink *wink
I’ll just keep peeing in a can in my truck
Divorce and take the kids (jk)
My understanding is that jk rowling will not get anything from this game
Get rid of her
Get the fuck away from her. What a piece of shit human being.
This made me very angry. I have a three word response for her:

FUCK.OFF.BITCH.
There is someone who will love you as you are. And for the woman you are at times. I hope to see that update here at some point. Good luck. 💜💜
>She has made it very clear that she cannot handle me presenting as anything but male.

fr forget the annoying wizard lady, OP you and your spouse have stuff to work out here
This is absolutely right! My wife stayed with me through my transition because, in her words, “You’re still you, and that’s the person I love”. OP needs to leave the situation, because “wife” obviously has no respect for OP at all. This will only get worse in the long run and damage the relationship they have with their sons.
I was crestfallen after I managed to get the courage to speak to her about the way I am inside, and she made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

We've been together for a long time, and it's very likely we've just drifted too far on our paths. I get a little sad when I think about couples that make it 30, 40 years or whatever, but that's not everyone. And when you're in a position where you start to feel that it would be better to be alone than to feel so goddamn lonely all the time, that's a sign.
Even if OP were a cis man wife was nasty and dismissive of them. Yuck.
Yeah. The goblins are an active slur, aren't they? And if my first option *isn't* to give my house elf a sock, then I'm not okay with it.

I didn't know about the nazi on the dev team. Dang. 

HP gave so many young kids a way to escape the daily little torments of being a kid and live with whatever it was that made them *weird*. It breaks my heart when I think of all the things that make it problematic. Like, it's an amazing wonderful world, but it you stop and think about it for 15 seconds too long, it all falls apart.

The more I think about it, the more I can't feel good about a potential purchase of the game.
couples therapy is an option, but make sure the therapist is trans-inclusive and won’t put you in an invalidating situation based on your gender
I would be perfectly happy to buy her a one-way plane ticket anywhere she likes. Is that the sort of option you're suggesting?
[removed]
Nice! But I wasn’t ready to go nuclear…

Will I ever be ready? Maybe. I’ll have to out myself to my kids first. I’m kind of a coward in this regard, TBH. On a rational level, I know they’ll accept me, but my wounded inner child is afraid of the consequences.
Thanks. I’ll give that video a watch. I always like to learn new things.
Not gonna lie: we definitely have problems relating to each other.
Being trans is such an easy shorthand for ""deviant"" and ""mentally ill"" that's seeped into the culture. As I understand it, Rowling wrote a trans villain into one of her mystery novels? Stupid, lazy shorthand. Really tipped her hand there.

I lived through the time of Matthew Shephard. He was two years younger than me. Me and my queer friends were actively harassed whenever we went out in Dallas. I've seen bad guys. The bad guys weren't my friends. We just wanted emotional and physical safety. The bad guys were the assholes protected from any real consequence by a gay-bashing society.

Fewer Caitlyn Jenners. More Eddie Izzards. That would be a good start. More visible role models who aren't taking any shit.

Sorry. Rambling.
There's an idea. Though the developers seem to be doing so much to take a lot of the toxicity out of the world for this game. Several of the choices shown in the ""State of Play"" video were obviously selected to demonstrate that. So, *they* certainly deserve support. But they still have house elves... And the goblins have always been a problem. I'm probably going to end up avoiding it. Rowling just makes me ill.
Thank you for the kind words and insight. I need to figure out how to navigate this. I'm going to start with wearing things that make me feel better underneath my current social uniform. We'll see how it goes from there.
Thinking about it more, if I can't give my house elf a sock, then I'm not going to consider it. There are enough strikes that I just can't feel good about it.

As for the therapy, I think this ship has sailed. I'm not quite giving up yet, but it's hard to muster the will to try any more.
Why ""JK?"" This person absolutely needs a divorce, and their children should not be with their mother.
Literally anything that has harry potter in its name will make jk money. That being said, for anyone who wants to play the game but not support her, you can check out r/piracy for safe ways of doing it.
No JKR is not involved in the game's development. She does profit off of it though as it uses her IP.
promoting & buying that game (and other HP merch) keeps her in the public consciousness, making investors want to invest in her and people approve of her because she's attached to media they like. she uses the money and power that affords her to hurt trans people.
Yeah like…holy shit. I can’t help it this this woman is going to cause (or has already caused) trauma for their two trans children. Since she obviously doesn’t view bring trans as real and had to find some TERFy excuse as to why FtM people exist.
Kid comes first. That is the deal you sign when you create them and/or agree to watch over them. Unconditional love. And if you truly love your child then you ALWAYS second guess every decision involving them no matter how right you think you are because a lot of the time being right isn't even really the true issue. You are supposed to playing the long game which should be more about not leaving marks than bashing the clay into shape. When you bash things they tend to explode. All real parenting is done by example anyway. If you lead and they don't follow it is probably because they have a will and life of their own although there is always the possibility that your way just sucks? If you aren't always keeping that in mind you aren't doing it right.

Sorry if this seems ranty, its really just general parenting advice that should apply to most things.
>She made it clear she wanted the inside to stay where it is.

OOF. 💔 I wish I couldn’t relate to this. But unfortunately I’m guessing many of us here *can*. As hard as it might be, we have to let go of the people who are unwilling to see us for who we truly are. Otherwise we’re just letting them take up the space of the ones who would.
Nah. I was just trying to be a bit more optimistic about her understanding, however I know from experience that it's very difficult for that to happen. Do what needs to be done, and best of luck.
? I think I misunderstood something, I was refering to her transphobic ideologies, or am I just confused?
what are you, OP's wife?
Being scared to come out is completely valid. I couldn't admit I was trans and accept it til I was 17 despite my mom being very supportive since I was 13. Take your time and I definitely recommend seeing a therapist. And remember, you're a valid bean deserving of love and respect 💖
Eddie Izzard isn’t a saint by any stretch of the imagination as she defended JKR.  She’s more interested in defending folks under attack in her social strata than standing up for trans folks.

I’m a supporter of you! I’m sure you got this but know we are here ❤️
This is precisely the point my eldest child was suggesting.
For better or worse HP isn’t going anywhere 
I’d rather people enjoy stuff that they like and let the relationship with the author die than try to extinguish the giant franchise
I understand. The kids don't have to seek my approval. They know that they have it unconditionally. They're not afraid to speak their mind with me. They don't fear repercussions. If they say something hurtful or generally tone-deaf, we talk about it. If I say or do something stupid, they call me out. I think we have a good relationship. They're wonderful people whithout a great deal of experience. So, we work together -- me and the kids -- to help them get the experience they're going to need to be independent, functional adults. 

What's more (and this is the part I'm really happy about): they're *kind*.
A logical extension of the “rule of no”. 

You have to say no to a thousand things, so you can say yes to the really important few.

Goddammit.
death of the author is all well and good if the author is dead and/or doesn't benefit socially or financially. pirating a game is ethical, buying fanmade merch is ethical, but no one should expect trans people to be comfortable with anyone advertising their enjoyment of a franchise made by the UK's premiere transphobe.
Sounds like you've got it! Sorry to hear about your situation. I've been with my almost 30 years. She has BPD which she treated with alcohol for years until it almost killed her. That turned her around and we've been headed back up ever since. With you on the kindness thing too, its one of the best yardsticks and how I met my wife.
Being honest, I'm not sure, but she is trying to force them to present how she wants them to present, says that trans people are justs a trend and agrees with J.K Rowling and is generally telling them to hide who they is, I thought it was safe to assume she was somewhat transphobic
Buying most good isn’t ethical. 
If you want to fight that fight it’s fine
But I’m not going to be mad if others don’t
[removed]
Believing that trans people are just a trend, that J.K Rowling is right or that trans women are a threat to cis women is a transphobic belief, so I will gladly take that advice you just gave me and throw it out the window, there are moments when you shouldn't assume anything, but there are moments like when your wife is literally ranting about trans people or saying we're a trend when you can already know what she thinks, you could talk her out of it, people can change, but if she is forcing you to be someone you are not because it makes her uncomfortable then she is not worth it."	ti1rxc	trans	525	0.94	2022-03-19 18:41:13
clothes shopping as a deeply closeted girl :(	"I was out clothes shopping today and looking at the boys clothes I felt so... disconnected? Empty? Five minutes later and we're passing through the women's section and everything is so pretty!! My heart was doing a little dance, while the rest of me just felt vaguely sad as there's no way I can wear things like that :( Idk what I'm looking for out of this, I suppose I just needed somewhere to vent lol

I hope all of you lovelies are doing well❤"	"Had the same thing for years. Hated everything in the woman’s section because it made me feel like a girl. Eventually I just realized I was the one allowing those clothes to make me feel that way. Now I wear whatever, as long as it makes me happy and comfy. I promise someday your closet will be so full of women’s clothes you won’t have room for any more :D
How I knew sumn was up w me tbh. I remember going to the mall n picking out outfits for my friends, outfits I wanted to wear. Shit hurted loll
I know the feeling. Now at Marshalls and TJMaxx I just stick around in the women’s section with my mom (who I’m VERY not out to). I actually get a lot of women’s clothes/shirts that “look more unisex” because she agrees that the men’s section is trash lol.
Aw, isn't that just the worst feeling. I'm sorry bout that, being closeted and shopping.. ah, sucks. 

But hey, you got through it, so keep your head up! Bet you 100% one day you'll find the nicest outfit to wear and you'll rock it without even knowing \^\^
I love shopping at target.

There is usually this moment when the other women notice I'm shopping along side them and they accept me. It's really nice, lol kinda like animals at a watering hole.
Shopping online was a first step for me. I'm still too anxious to buy obviously femme clothes in person.

Edit: wrong to(o)
When i was in the closet i use to buy clothes like tshirt and jeans but in the men section (i’m a trans man) ; no one could really tell that i was wearing men clothes but i would feel so great and euphoric because of the different shape of the clothes (shape really change btw men and women section) you really should try it! And if you’re worried about label most of them can be cut. Also if you’re afraid of being judged about what you buy tell yourself that people will think you’re making gifts (i say that because i used to worry about this a lot). Hope it help you my trans sister! :)
I know the feel. 
 I went out today to try and buy clothes for the school year. After sitting in my car for 30 minutes I walked in and walked right back out.
I dont have the courage to tell my parents im trans a 4th time, each time they (mainly my mom) just brush it off and ignore it, not bringing it up for months so I can never get the clothes I ACTUALLY want when I go clothes shopping.
Its a joint struggle lmao
My heart breaks for you. I hope that some day you can be yourself, truly and unabatedly💕
It gets easier each time you do it 😌
You can still buy neutral-looking blouses and trousers/jeans. Nobody will be able to tell they're women clothes simply by looking at you, but you will know what you're wearing. (:
Honestly as an ftm, I can still appreciate how pretty girl’s clothes are. I also have to wear women’s clothes still because of sizing issues (though I occasionally buy a cheeky men’s sweater). I just choose the baggiest stuff. But seriously, women’s clothes are beautiful.
Have queer friends? Maybe shop with them?
Just wear whatever you want
I. Feel. You. So bad. I did the same the other day. You’re not alone
as a 6' tall, dad bod bearded woman who is just starting to shop in the womens section, the thing that pulled the trigger for me is just standing in it and looking through the clothes, and seeing how many other people actually paid attention to me being there. It turns out no one else cares if you take a few outfits home and put them on in your room. You might not escape without a dirty look from the cashier but that's about the worst of it.
Highly recommend Walmart clearance to figure out size... I've gotten shirts and pants for as little as $1! 

If you're in a situation where it wouldn't be safe for you to wear or own women's clothing, I'm sorry, and I hope you figure something out soon.
Try getting a womens flannel. They will look essentially the
Same but it may help you a bit knowing it’s womens
I’ve always called myself a “picky shopper” and never knew why until recently when I figured out that I’m trans. I’m still in the closet too. You can try experimenting with womens clothes at home and see how you feel in them.
I've started buying a lot more ""womens"" clothing lately and most of the time when I look in the mirror I end up thinking ""there's nothing obviously feminine about this other than it being in the womens section"". 

After the first couple shopping experiences I now have no shame being in the womens section and if I end up talking to someone I just say how boring the mens section is and they always agree. Then I fit right in. 

I'd just start trying more stuff on. You'd be surprised how much womens clothing works fine on men too.
You could always try taking someone with you or if someone asks say its for someone else
Just go shopping in a shop were no one knows you. You pick up, try and buy whatever you want and in whatever section you want.
The last time I went shopping for clothes I felt like everything was geared for guys in their 60’s that enjoy weekends “at the lake”, or T fueled maniacs that want to rip the heads off of things.  Kind of accepted that may be the last time I try shopping in boy mode.


Also by “at the lake” I really mean perpetuating casual racism, sexism, homophobia, transphobia, xenophobia, probably ace-phobia? And so forth.
Bring a girl friend with you and have her buy it for you? There's got to be ways.
I feel the same way honestly. Like it’s not even that mens clothing are that bad in anyway, it’s just not for me and they just don’t suit me well anymore as they used to (that and I just think boys clothing is somewhat boring). 

Going through the womens clothing was a fresh of breathe air. So may vibrant colors, lots of design, very pretty and cute outfits to choose from and combine. It was so exciting, though I could buy any or take them home with me unfortunately. 

One day I will though! :)
Aww I'm so happy that you could get to that place!! And thank you!! I really hope so🥰
Aww i know the feeling, it's awful right? I bet you have all the prettiest outfits now though!!🥰
Yeah, I do the same lol, or when I'm out with my girl friends I just stick with them😆 That's so cool! I might try that line of argument lol ;)
Aww thank you so much!! Your comment made me smile, and the thought of drifting about in a floaty dressy outfit made me very happy :) Thank you!❤
That is actually adorable!! I hope i get there one day🥰
I'm building up to ordering some girl clothes from Shein, I'm just worried about the parcels getting intercepted before I get to them😅
Aww thank you so much for the advice my trans brother!!!🥺 I'm honestly working up the courage to order some girl clothes - and I wear skinny jeans quite a bit so I suppose womens jeans wouldn't be too much out of place!❤
Yeah :( I'm sorry. One day we'll get there, I'm sure❤
Aww I'm so so sorry you're not being accepted :( I hope you're able to get the clothes you'd like to wear - and I'm sure one day you will❤
Thank you so much❤
Yeah I'm hoping so!❤
That's a wonderful idea! I think I will try that🥰
They seriously are so pretty aren't they?? I honestly wish clothing had no gendered connotations, if people want to be pretty let them dress pretty!

Also I wish there wasn't a trade-off - men's clothes is a lot more practical, or at least i think (I'm looking at pockets hahaha) Also YES. Baggy clothes are my saviour😆❤
I don't unfortunately :( Funnily enough i dreamt I did the other night! That's made me start thinking of trying to make some lol
If ONLY it were that simple😭
Thank you❤ It's nice knowing I'm not alone, but I'm sorry anyone else has to feel this way. We'll all get there one day!!
I really hope to work myself up to it one day!! I'm trying to get the courage to order things quietly online - I'd be terrified of being recognised if I actually went into the shops😅 Thank you so much for the advice though, I'm really trying to get my head around the idea that *no one cares* what I look at or buy in the shops, you know? I hope you have a wonderful day❤
That's a lovely idea, thank you! I do love a flannel shirt😄
I definitely will be once I work up the courage! And yeah, I've definitely been a picky shopper in the past lol😆❤
I absolutely will!! A lot of people have recommended getting... I guess you'd call ""stealthy"" women's clothes like you suggest! Thank you for the reassurance about shopping in the women's section - it's really helping me build up the courage!!❤
I think I'll say it's for someone else! I used to live with girl friends, but we've all moved home now :( I'm kicking myself for missing that opportunity lol
Yeah definitely!! I'm really working up the courage now so many of you lovelies are telling their own stories/reassuring me🥰
Don't worry I know exactly what you mean! I think this last time boy clothes shopping has definitely been a turning point for me❤
Yeah I could! I would be nervous to ask her, but that might work😄
Do you have a local friend who you are out to? I was going to suggest a PO Box but idk how old you are or how expensive that might be. 

I thought of this because while I am cis, I had a situation that was abusive and my mother got a friend’s mom to help with an issue of something I couldn’t have before leaving for school and returning home. It was…not a great situation. But it worked. I’m sorry you even have to go through that. I made sure my kid never had to go through what I went through and I made sure they didn’t go through this either. So if it is your parents, and you know what they will say, I’m sorry but know you will have people who see you and love you for exactly who you are. *hugs if wanted*
You’re welcome you go girl! 😁🤗
I sincerely hope so aswell, have a great day!!1
You could always do what I do. Wear really bright men’s clothing? Could help a little. ASOS does great, affordable clothing for men that isn’t boring adidas :)
I think it’d be a really good thing 🤗
You are not! It’s tough. I’m bald. That’s my issue. Tallish but thin so I could probably transition nicely! Who fucking knows lol
No problem! Flannel is amazing!!
I feel you. If it's any comfort, please know that no one is looking at you while you shop. As a former resident of NYC, I couldn't tell you who I saw on a daily basis. Try thrifting in a nearby town. It's a cheaper way to figure out your size
If it's still warm where you are start with shorts. Super easy to pass off as male presenting, but you get a little dopamine hit knowing they're meant for women. My short selection has progressively gotten shorter and more colorful/patterned through this summer yet I don't look like a man in womens clothes at all.
For me everytime I do it, in full boy mode(I prefer it that way because if something looks good or decent is going to look AMAZING once I put the effort in looking feminine) is difficult at first but then I get more and more comfortable.
I don't unfortunately!! I am completely in the closet lol😅 I could do that, I'm in my twenties so I'm sure I could sort it out. It's nothing near abusive - my parents are wonderful wonderful people and I love them very much. I'm simply not ready to be out, and I would have trouble explaining why on earth I had girl clothes, you know? I really genuinely appreciate your concern - the world needs more wonderful people like yourself❤ *P.S I will gladly accept the hugs!! :)*
Thank you, you too!!🥰
Oh that's a wonderful idea!! Thank you so much, I'll check it out🥰
It would be lovely!!🥰🏳️‍⚧️
You could definitely transition nicely!! Lots of girls are bald, and there's loads of lovely wigs out there. Also I think tall girls are really pretty🥰
Thank you! Thrifting sounds cute. I don't live somewhere quite so big as NYC but that is still very reassuring🥰 I think the consensus I'm getting really is that I can shop in the women's section without drawing *any* attention, which is really nice to know!
That's interesting! I wouldn't have figured shorts, I normally don't like having my (man) legs out. Maybe that's because I've been wearing shorts for men? I'll take a look though!🥰
No problem. I have a trans gf, and my kiddo is enby. And actually, since I was last on here I came out as gender fluid myself. I kinda didn’t realize I get the not ready thing. 

Except I realized it was my relatives that were my reason. I had to cut most of one side of my family out when my kiddo came out. I held onto a couple but realized they were the reason why. 

So I’m really glad to hear your parents are wonderful. It warms my heart to know that there are more good people out there.
Thanks ur litterally so sweet omg/p"	wokv8n	trans	522	0.99	2022-08-15 00:12:22
Whats your clothing style or what do you want it to be?	I want like a long sleeve crop top very badly	"I like long mid calf flowy skirts with a cute top or nice tshirt.
Maybe a black hoodie with any sort of cute skirt? Idk
I want it to be goth!
Same, I even have the curves for it

But unfortunately my man face would make everything look weird
Alternative. Everything is Plaid. I’m MTF Trans now (Male to Flannel)
Hoodies and sweats to conquer the dysphoria.
I want to be like, really really fancy. Suits and shit I love that stuff. Other than that, probably like your average guy idk. I like jeans and sweatpants and flannels and button up shirts and hoodies, I don’t really know how I could describe my style tbh. Dark academia clothes seem really cool tho from what I’ve seen I need to get some outfits under that aesthetic. On my own time though, catboy style
The best way I can describe mine is Boho Goth with Asian influences.
I want to be punk, but I’m too lazy so most people say I dress grunge or emo
Would love to rock just a white T-shirt and jeans. Not possible yet without being clocked, so I'm sticking to layers. And for working out, can't wait to go shirtless. Just gotta save up enough money for top surgery first.
Punky Anime chick, lots of adorable little things on my arms neck and head.
I wear a lot of plaid due to growing up on a farm, but I want to go to wearing my sports bra, cute jeans and my shirt wrapped around my waist with a badass pair of shit kickers
When I'm flat chested I really want to wear crop tops again but in the way men wore them in the 80s with cut off shorts

With my ideal body, I want to wear crop tops, sleeveless shirts, and form fitting T shirts, with basic jeans and either boots or fashionable sneakers. I also wish I pulled off backwards baseball caps. Basically I want to be a gay fuckboy 😂 idc idc, idc if I look like a dick it's the style I WANT
Nerdy hippy chic.
I dress in a pirate aesthetic, have for the last few years
Honestly one day I want full punk emo goth and the next I want pink bubblegum girl soooo like every style you can think of I want
I'm fairly feminine I have heels ankle booties mostly dresses and tunics a few skinny jeans
Anything that makes my ass look good.
Mine is like a classy sleek look but also with flowers
Sort of a mix between alt, emo, and loner (like dark hoodies and such)
I listen to deathmetal and deathcore so it be cool to be DM chick or bring back some MySpace scene vibes, I already own a million band shirts just need more feminine pants and accessories
I mix of punk and hippy
I would love to have my style be a mix of cottage-core and alt
Pastel alt
 cute tops with skirts or dresses
Willy wonka from the 1971 movie.
I JUST WANT TO WEAR SKIRTS 😫
I want to be one of those like effortlessly dapper kinda guys with a loose/puffy 3/4 sleeve top that's only half tucked in and semi-casual dress pants, with a nice hair flip and something like a leather bracelet, somewhere halfway between pirate and business LOL
anything that men wear but with jackets
I want a huge ass jacket, in a dark red with some red sneakers and a orange shirt + plus jeans (then the same thing but instead of a red jacket a teal)
Like female y2k, archive, or thrifted vibes 😭
Whatever suburban white dad would be classified under
I only love sweatshirts and sport shorts, I dress the same every day
I am a straight up e-boy mixed with grunge and emo!
Soft boy cuz who doesn't like soft boys
Fem goth
Soft butch. A button up blouse completely unbuttoned, spaghetti strap undershirt, faded jeans, and comfortable boots.
Like tom boy skater girl with the occasional girly girly days
Whatever the hell you get when you mix cottage core and street punk and somehow make it look good.
Alt girl
Dark academia/school boy vibes, I have to go to a school girl so it’s kinda like a replacement I guess. Collars and v neck sweats for thr win!
pretty much anything cottagecore
Absolutely everything, would love to be able to go to a store and check out everything and be able to where them everywhere 💕💕💕💕
i'm nb, but ever seen adventure time? marceline without the flannel is just my gender in general
oh my god i fell asleep and woke up to 400 comments
emo scrawny evil horrible goblin dumbass
i wanna be a mix of just casual tshirt and shorts then switch it up and be rly femme.. with the occasional suit bc suits r pretty cool i think.
If it wasn't for the punk rock style, I'd go with russian 60s explorer style! Full in trench coat and ushanka!
Cyberpunk like is what i want
A mix of pastel, emo and goth. Sometimes pastel, sometimes not. Always emo and goth though. This is what one wants. Oh, and those boots with the wheels on the bottom. One thinks it would be funny.
Dream look would be goblincore. Sometimes I achieve that, but most of the time it’s either grunge or hippyish
I basically wear sweatshirts all the time- sometimes flannel on top of t-shirt (ftm)
Tbh anything I go from fem to masc, homeless style, punk, goth emo, I just wear whatever I find

Tho what I really want to wear is samurai armor or medieval
[Rain] Honestly depends on alter who would be dressing us and their mood, so like either cottage core, something a bit librarian chic, or grandma chic, others like athleisure, but like we want to actually move out and stop being closeted to really figure that out.
Actually, is the a pure, man with tight clothes, it's gonna turn into, bigender with girly and manly tight clothes
I want a mix of punk and pink girly girl.
Lesbian cat lady
I really love oversized hoodies and tshirts. Sadly I can't really find some that actually look oversized on my body. At a certain size they just become wider and not longer.... I'd probably have to buy hoodie dresses, but I'm too scared and I haven't found a fitting one of those either.
Depends on the mood.
I *want* it to be Luz's outfit on Grom night, but unfortunately, I'd look terrible in a skirt.
Fantasy style dress that can look pretty and casual but easy change to be seen in a somewhat seductive sense.. honestly just to mess with people during the rare times I feel like a baddie
I think I'd like to wear stuff that's like, punk or pastel goth (I think that's the right term), maybe some other stuff depending on how I'm feeling or what the weather's like. Maybe also where I'm going/what I'm doing.
I am a bat!
Pastel colors and enough skirts so that I will never have to wear pants again
Lots of brights, lots of tight stuff, I like japanese kawaii inspired clothes, and I wanna wear more. Lots of artistic stuff especially
Sweaters and jeans. What I would prefer is a steampunk dresses and top hats. (Basically Caitlyn from LOL , but a longer skirts and more top hats)
Alternative. Anywhere from grunge to emo to punk to goth. Just depends on my mood lol. Working on getting more feminine clothing (MTF btw)
Horror movie/band/fun t-shirts and ripped skinny jeans. I'm just being who I truly always have been. 

I'd love to try some comfy women's flannel shirts. And when I was a child, I always dreamed of wearing a beautiful yellow sundress.
Gothabilly!
Goth! Unfortunately, I own like 0.4 goth outfits, and I have no money to buy new clothes/outfits
Skinny jeans/skirt band shirt and a denim jacket
Tactical
Band tees and nerd skirts!
I wanna be a femboy, but I don't have the right body type :(
I'm already emo but i want to be an emo guy, rather than an emo girl, want it so bad lmao
Tee with ripped sleeves, a pair of shades, and for people to not treat that as a guy thing.
I want to wear the uniforms from star trek the next generation, but everyone keeps telling me ""nooo, you'll look like a dork.""

Captain Picard disagrees....
Punk rock valor stealer
I like soft goth!! 🖤
Honestly if I liked my body I just wouldn’t wear clothes lol
Honestly anything with dresses. If I ever have to wear a pair of pants again I'll scream, ha
idk  
i like skirts but i dont want to be overly hyper feminine
Hood Latina skater girl with some 1950s thrown in their.
I want to get back into goth/rocker so bad. I had my foot in the door at the end of highschool and it was one of the first times I felt like me, but had to closet the boots and pants for work and never had *time* to wear anything other than jeans and $10 sneakers. I'm saving up for some new 5"" platform boots, which plays an extra bonus as I'm a short bitch. I'll be able to reach the top shelf again. And also I'm getting my ears professionally pierced later this month
Hoodies I stole from my boyfriend or a flannel over t-shirt and comfy sweatpants with either. I always wear a blue and black toque and a small navy blue backpack with pride pins
Some sort of retro/varowave vibes. 

I want to try out a more alt/goth style, but I tend to prefer the brighter asthetic
i dress like a little emo boy
I dress like ive completely given up on life, which I have lol. Usually jeans or cargo pants with any hoodie, you will rarely see me without a hoodie. They're comfy and I can hide in them.
Strongly considering goth / rocker chick look but also want to be uwu gamer girl. Help.
My style can be best described as “fat mom”.  Lots of tunics and mom jeans with the occasional plaid shirt.
Something between grunge and punk.  I want to start wearing more masculine style crop tops once I get a better binder.  I feel like im a bit old for it but life is short so fuck it.
My wife dresses like a gay marshmallow and I dress goth and it's *very* funny
I like hoodies and jeans because I'm in Australia so it's winter, specifically my Hamilton hoodie because it has a straight line right across my chest so I can easily see the lack of curve. I wish I had my binder but it hasn't even arrived yet.

In the summer however, I usually wear shirts and shorts, and if it's a particularly cool day I'll wear the usual winter outfit. The good thing about the winter outfit is that I don't need to wash the jeans and hoodie as often as other clothes, I can wear this for like 3 days straight, which I wouldn't if I was going out somewhere, but other clothes you wear one day and then wash them so yeah.
Is it at the thrift shop?

Does it fit?

Then it is my style!

No, but seriously, I like tops with wide, plunging necklines that hide my shoulders, and big floofy skirts that make it look like I have hips.

Boho style works pretty good for this.

I have a really nice goth dress from Betsey Johnson that friend gave me and that I have worn way too much. 

I love Gothic Lolita style ( I wrote a song inspired by it! [https://tinabelmont.bandcamp.com/track/go-slowly](https://tinabelmont.bandcamp.com/track/go-slowly) ) but it is kinda expensive, and hard to find a good place to wear it, so I don't own much of it.

Around the house, it is usually the same thin print skirt and t-shirt with the collar cut out... I really need more casual clothes...
I want a sexy dress so badly
I love Techware but don’t own a single piece of clothing that fits
I've bought like :'-) five tailored suits since my hips slimmed down enough to fit men's trousers properly. 
I have twenty seven ties. I love ties. One has Winnie the Pooh on it.
Remember those Tripp pants from Hot Topic.  Basically that plus pink.  So Yami Kawaii.
I'm still trying to find my style...  


Maybe just find what's comfortable?
A lot of black, stuff like tall socks or tights that fit under my leg braces, skirts, I still need to learn how to wear a bra, because I can't pull on a dress without my chest looking huge.

I have a thing for collars and spiked bracelets at the moment, as well.
Masc grunge
I want to go full goth clothes and at the same time realllllyyyyyy cute dresses
Grungy cottagecore
Im trans female (tomboy) i work construction 6 days a week and I want more girl type work cloths. Some form fitting work pants and t-shirts.
Kinda like golf wang or smoke weed in it outfit, i also like punk fashion so i'd mix them. I would switch between earthy colors like green and brown and bright palettes like yellow and hot pink. I would wear lot of shorts that reach knees and short sleeve button ups with weird prints.

Btw great question!
Black T-shirt, jeans, black chelsea boots.  As neutral as I can possibly get.
Gay boho mum
Hoodies, skater hat, jeans jacket, piercings (helix, nostril, earlobe), high waist jeans, white sneakers
i want the early 2000s skater boy aesthetic but my body doesn’t work with it
I don't know if I've ever had a ""style"" in particular, but I dress now in basically the female equivalent of how I dressed before. Bit of a grunge/metalhead is the closest I could label it I guess!
Tomboy with some nice skirts from time to time - mainly comfortable casual clothing which looks nice as well
I wear mostly black and purple, basic looks like sweats and and hoodies.

I'd like to wear more goth styles.
I want to be punky but also wear floral pastel dresses at the same time
A weird fusion of goth, bohemian, and a heavy dose of witchcraft. Lots of long flowy skirts, lace, and turtlenecks. I think there is a higher prevalence of goth/dark aesthetic people in the trans community.
I'm hoping for something goth, maybe a bit punkish. Don't know where I'd start though. I suppose it'll come with time.
It's usually ripped skinny jeans, a random shirt, and my battle jacket. (I go to a lot of punk shows, your ""battle jacket"" is usually a denim jacket with a ton of patches all over it from all the shows you've been to). Oh and my black lipstick and some hairspray
I'd say Mall Goth and 2000s emo/scene, depending on the day and my gender of the day(I'm genderfluid). Like black ripped jeans, kandi and studded belts for more masc days but corsets, short black/checkered skirts for more fem days. But always chains galore and eyeliner is a necessity
I’m in two styles and it’s either Lolita or cottage core
Anything alternative, techwear, grunge anything like that I love. Also dark academia
A mix between goth and casual. The only problem that I have encountered so far is that sometimes I'm a bit hipster because I like old Polaroids and apparently it's hipster to enjoy that hobby when I'm transitioning :v
I do hoodies and tracks with airpods
T2 Sarah Conner.
Usually either flannels or fancy waistcoats haha
I like checked skirts and biggish comfy hoodies lol
I like really gothy stuff. Usually all black with a splash of color.
Emo, goth style, but also cute feminine bright clothes I like both, but emo is more of a unique style.
Fighting Game Lesbian
What it is: 00s hobo
What I want it to be once I can actually suit it: expensive slytherin who's way out of everyone's league
Want to be: emo femboy
Currently: looking like a butch lesbian to other people probably which I hate since it's the exact opposite of what I want to be and it doesn't even make me pass anyway
I want to wear manto and scarf(It's usually style in my country for women. I love to make-up and polish my nails. I want to live like real women!
Grunge alt :)))))
I want to wear big hoodies and a skirt
I'd love to wear comfy, bright-coloured and cute/beautiful clothing most of the time. 

So cute long or middle-sized skirts, sweaters, cute tops, some thighs or maybe a cute dress would be almost always the answer for me. 

In the summer I'd love to also just wear tops with nice prints on them and skirts with black thighs. 

In the winter preferably cute sweaters or jackets with fitting jeans.
Hoodie and skirts
I really wish I didn't look like a boy.
I've always wanted to be able to wear sundresses
I wanna dress soft goth. Like I love fish nets, leather and dark tones.

But also soft baggy hoodie and baby doll

Not quite pastal goth
Punk/ Worker aesthetic (overalls and stuff)
I have two primary goals: androgynous pirate and Catwoman circa 2004. The moment I’m free from titties I’m wearing whatever the hell I want. I wanna be bold. I wanna be free. I wanna be the kind of guy that tempts good Christian men without even trying. Basically, an incubus. Or Zorro
There are so many! Why tie yourself down to one! Be one thing one day, and another the next. Currently working on the ""gypsy-goth"" look, and artsy school girl, and sporty with edge. I wouldn't want to pick a lane style wise. Ditto to permanent makeup. Changing it up is what it's all about!😁
Black long trousers, white long sleeve shirt and black vest (MtF)
My style isuahsgdkfoenvlvr, i like summer dresses as much as like to look like an angsty teenager as much as I sometimes just wanna wear whatever is the most comfortable, or look like a delicate princess. My friends that understands fashion said I'm weird but cute lol
Well right now I am attracted to floral dresses but got mainly just dresses 1 cute skirt with top a few bras mom wants me to go shopping with her soon tho she thinks I need longer dresses lol love been girly tho 💓 💗
Either stuff along the lines of a turtle neck, blazer/or leather jacket,  a necklace or two with a ring and boots (Wish I had dress shoes). Or a more tight fitting long sleeve shirt , skater skirt with or without tights/knee highs, boots/sneakers. I only go for the turtle neck blazer combo mostly since i feel uncomfortable with my body and despite being comfortable myself with looking fem my parent kind of ruined it for me, and some things are hard since being short makes me look like a kid in their parents clothes. There are other styles I want to try but I don't have the money or confidence.
Goth/punk i do really love those styles x3

Also really into cure dresses too. 

Ohhh i want to wear those u.u
SSSS Combo

Sweater, Skirt, Stockings/Socks, Sneakers

I've collected 2 of these, every piece, my power grows
Literally just anything goth or emo. I've loved the style since I was a young teen and now that I can I plan to live out my dreams as a goth queen. I already dress as goth as possible and wear all black! And I love it! n.n

I specifically love the ripped skinny jeans with band tee look its lazy but cute
I will become the goth banana. Black banana outfit every day for every occasion.
crop top is the chemical root of my dysphoria
Alt,fishnets,black
right now i dress grunge/emo, but i also really want to be a boy who wears crop tops but my body is already too feminine as it is so if i wear a crop top i’ll just probably be misgendered
Boho, but I need more coverage than it usually provides :(
I want mine to be gothic/emo and sexy
CUTE GIRL SHIT. also probably most things girls my age wear, especially alternative people
What I like, and what wound up being comfortable in me, wound up being the soccer mom look. But my oldest says I pull it off well…LOL
Casual

- Tank top or tee shirt
- Track pants, joggers, or running shorts
- Semi-fitted hoodie

Pretty much the same as pre transition tbh, only the cuts and fit for some of the clothes have changed. I already wore a decent amount of womens clothes pre transition though.

My professional and date night clothing has changed more though. For example last date I wore 7/8 length pants and a fitted asymmetric zip jacket over a tank.

I’ve never worn a dress or a skirt and I don’t see that ever changing. Closest I get to that are oversize split hem sweaters.
overalls and polo shirts just a funky forest boy
Pretty dykey. Lots of denim, oversized shirts over crop tops, some dresses and skirts occasionally, usually a little gothy (altho it comes out very baby bat lol). Boots, high heeled or not, or converse. 

I work in an office that is v casual, but I've a few more dressy pieces. Need more shoes tbh
I basicly bounce between 90s skate punk (short skits. Tartan. Long socks etc) and goth/vampire succubus
As someone who questions whether or not they might be gender fluid, I dig pink styles such as black t shirts and anime pink wear.
Lately it’s been flow-y high water linen pants or down baggy high waisted denim with a cute sweater. 

It’s in style. God I’m so glad I can freely express this side of me now I absolutely love fashion
Well if we’re talking what we want our styles to be I wanna dress in like tight itty bitty outfits and super revealing stuff basically I wanna be a slut
i am yet to figure out, i'm testing a lot
Goth girl who has been to 5 different mental asylums vibes for me
At most all I have are a few dresses, though being build like a linebacker kinda keeps them tucked away
im genderqueer, so i would like to dress androgynously (maybe switching ut up from day to day) and in a vintage style, like one day i wanna leave the house lookin like david bowie and the next like audrey hepburn B)
my aesthetic is a constant battle between cute anime girl and punk tomboy
I’m more on the masculine side of things when I can be (with family I feel like I have to present fem because they don’t know I’m non-binary and it would be hard to explain what it is to them). I really wanna nail like an actual androgynous look, but I can’t find anything in my closet what would mesh well together/:
comfortable.
Rock that long sleeve crop babe!!!! I’ve got a brown one with the shoulders out I’m in love with 😍❤️ oh and for style I lean to either alt or streetwear x
Same as always just in a more feminine way. 
The whole alternative/emo/goth/punk style that I’ve been rocking since forever.
Hippy stoner plant mom. Minimal makeup, nonchalant about body hair. That’s what I want to be if I can feminize enough.

Currently, whatever flatters what I’m working with. Sorta mom vibes, which makes sense since I have a young child.
I started dressing like scene/goth. Kinda great actually.
Honestly, I love the pastel goth style but I'm so comfy in black. Hoping to slowly incorporate pastel pink accents onto my all black outfits. 🥺🖤
I want tech wear outfits, and a suit for men.
My style is ""goth girl assaulted by claire's employees"" or just ""possessed pixie"" for short
Goblincore 👀
I always loved off-shoulder tops, which is why I made that my go to style when I came out. Luckily none of my friends use that look much, which makes it my signature style.
I want to egirl grunge yet lolita goth yet anime girl(skirt + thigh highs type) all at the same time
I really like 2 do a verity of combinations of skirts with male clothing I think it suits me best
Mostly black/dark grey. 

Pants, long sleeve, a trench coat, a sapphire blue/red scarf, silver(color wise) watch, gold hexagonal glasses, and maybe red colored contacts/dyed hair. 

Or just an oversized long sleeve T/short sleeve crop top.

Oh, flannel pretty fun.
Panties and leggings!!! Love the feeling of panties and how my butt looks in leggings!! :)
i like mid thigh to knee length skirts with a matching shirt and a open hoodie for poeckets, sadly with my body type unless someone sees the skirt they assume im a boy =CC
so generally skaterish?
I think that platform boots are just like so hot. If I cound get some hilariously tall floral boots and a grunge hipster outfit to match that would be *chefs kiss*
I would just be a chameleon; sometimes dressing as a goth girl and other times as a sunflower.
rn i wear big and long pants with crop tops or more fitting shirts in general and i just wanna be able to wear more revealing clothes in general? 

basically the way i dress rn is what i find most flattering of my form while also the combination i think creates the most believable illusion as to what my silhouette really is :/ 

ps the biggest form of gender envy i feel is like smol rib cages and wide hips :/ 

just walked out of an exam so hoping this made at least some sense to u all ghwusooaekfjucxuxis
I mean right now I dressing like the straightest straight boy ever, helps passing as masc.
I don't even know what I would like to wear otherwise, my sense of style just left me once dysphoria kicked in.
I want full on goth and grunge wear, chains, harnesses, veils, boots, all the good shit. But also a bunch of really cute cottagecore dresses.
Lots of cute stuff, cottage , lots of skirts and dresses lol
Feral stray catgirl
Muscle tanks and you can see my sports bra through the side
Dark and gothy. Combining plenty of masc and fem bits, enough to confuse people.
About to sound like a FTM stereotype but I'm very into Alt fashion, no specific ""brand"" of it like punk or goth just Alt stuff as a whole. I wanna wear the jeans with chains specifically but I know I won't look good in it rn.
i love classic emo style but i always look like a boy wearing it lol
Lowkey grunge. Like clearly I'm alt but not too blatant. Really I just want comfy jeans, comfy shirt, not to sweat in my binder, and when it's cold a baggy black hoodie
Thigh high socks with a shortish skirt and a cute t shirt maybe long sleeve crop top would be really nice.
I kinda alternate from kawaii or lotita fashion to graphic tees and button ups (I’m non-binary)
I want to be a car girl, like fast and furious vibes.
Leggings and long sleeve shirts!!!
I really wanna wear loose tank tops, tight ass jeans etc (basically stereotypical lesbian stuff). But I can never do that as 1, I can't have cleavage for the top and 2, I have too much bottom cleavage for the jeans
White shirts, cargo pants, hoodies, suits, loafers, etc.
I just wanna be a hobbit
I wear a lot of thrifted gothic clothing but I want to get into fetish goth but latex is so expensive that I don’t have the money for it
i want it to be 2000s mens fashion, think like low-rise/distressed jeans, cargo pants, collared shirts, some flannel, chunky shoes, and lots of leather bc i rlly love leather lmfaoo i love fashion in general so i want to curate a good wardrobe once i begin transitioning

itd be kinda plain and a little simple but tbh i just want to get to a point where i can just walk outside in smth like a white t-shirt and jeans and not feel dysphoric
I like calf-length casual dresses.
Gothic style alway will and always will be 🤘🤘👑👑
A mix between clothes that show some skin and are black, preferably with chains somewhere on them, and oversized hoodies with jeans. Depends on how much effort I wanna put in that day.
Currently dress like a lumberjack, would prefer to dress like a bog witch
I wanna say cottage core, but I don’t have the body for it
I very much want to have a bad girl style. Song long boots ripped jeans a crop top and good leather jacket. You can change the jeans with some nice leggings and a mini skirt.
I’m going for more of a punk aesthetic
I'm eclectic and colourful! I like mushroom shirts and pretty jeans 😄 but that long sleeved crop top sounds 👌🏼👌🏼
Soft grunge skater boy is all I could ever ask for. Also good hair. REALLY good hair. (FtM)
I really want to wear Ouji fashion but it's too expensive so I just stick to ye old 'the first things I see off my floor' fashion (FTM btw)
I so desperately want to dress in nice suits with a coat, or wear a shirt, tie and waistcoat, or just a shirt with a nice bow tie. Or even a shirt and sweater, or even a polo shirt that fits snug. With suspenders, or matching belts and shoes, with SUPER funky socks! I just wanna dress like a boring but stylish man, is that too much to ask?? 😂
I definitely prefer winter like clothing, but living in Texas, I don’t get that option very often…
Eboy vibessss
Librarian / art teacher
Just like sweatpants and cool graphic hoodies
Crop top + skirt
Grunge lol
Well you see.......I don't know.......
Baggy-ish jeans, shirt that fits the shoulder and ships
Lots of black.
Right now it’s basically just big hoodies and jeans, once I get some more confidence I wanna dress kinda goth and dye my hair black and green (it’s auburn naturally)
I want to dress either goth or short skirts and crop tops and there’s no in between-
Hoodies, sweats, and a sports bra orrrr thrift store dad clothes. Oversized jeans and button ups.
I like looking like a Faery, and that changes based on my environment 🧚‍♂️
Currently wearing what looks good. Feminine. 

Ideally vintage 20s/40s style
Oh god, I’ve admired so many women in my time, it will be so hard to pick! I vacillate between witchy/goth, tomboy/queer, and flowery/sunny all the time. Maybe some variation or combination of them all!
Anyone know estir from sucker for love. Because it’s her.
I'MMA BE THE NO-TIDDY GOTH GF THE INTERNET NEEDS BUT DIDN'T ASK FOR
western style snap button up shirt, jean jacket, worn black jeans, 5.11 boots or flip flops, and maybe a black cowboy hat. I want to get some cowboy boots that match my quiver
I want it to be either ""cool grunge guy"", ""cute emo/grunge girlfriend"" or ""whatever this is, is hot"", but I'm stuck with ""señora, but younger"" until I get to buy my own clothes, lmao.
Gothic casual or sometimes romantic Goth
Essentially my style is alternative + art hoe + skater
i just really want a sweater dress
baggy shirts/hoodies paired with some boyfriend style jeans or cargo pants. can't go wrong with those. add some jewelry on top and boom. perfect.
My friend. Have you heard of Foxblood? Size inclusive, excellent quality. And 2 kinds of long-sleeve crops. One solid cotton modal, one black mesh. Also crop hoodies and the crop tee. All great. The only thing is everything is black (which is how I like my stuff lol) if that's you too, I highly recommend.

Foxblood.com
I lean towards business attire by day and goth chic by night...
Dresses, skirt and shirt combo's, or casual.  


though I want to incorporate some goth/slash rocker looks into my wardrobe
Honestly just wanna be able to wear makeup and colorful stuff without being misgendered /lh
I live inside plaid shirts and dark jeans BUT I want to pull off the shirtless blazer aesthetic so fucking bad lol
I'd love to go full pirate!
I'm a little bit of everything, but mainly punk/gothic style with (as my friend put it) ""major lesbian vibes"" lol
Forest nymph 🧚‍♀️
god idk
i always find outfits that look very gender
My own style, that I'm working on updating my wardrobe with, can be described as 'cozy goth witch'. Like, loose comfortable pants and shirts/sweatshirts, cool necklaces/rings (worn several at a time), shawls, all in black or dark colors
kidcore . i wish to dress in the kidcore style so bad
I love flowy pant plus a crop top or just a tank top with jeans
I would just like to be able to shop without dissociating and feeling sick to my stomach.
I'm a leggings and tank top/hoodie, OR a skirt/dress type of gal. 

Sporty/Casual or Dressy af 🤣
It's hard to explain  but it gives off a don't mess with me vibe
Mainly wearing formal clothing such as suits with ties and also have a masculine dark academia clothing style.
I love skirts, tights and crop tops so so much they feel so good to wear and i feel so cute
Nerdy suburban housewife at home (the comfier the better) but starting to veer into more hard femme elements as I see the changes and get more confident.
Currently wearing androgynous outside of work like a crop top that reaches just above my belt, tight jeans around my hips and a flannel (on like a coat or around my waist for extra hip/confusion). (Also fairly androgynous hair currently) Kinda grunge I'd say.

I want to dress in mid shin/ankle length skirts and nice blouses, flats, bob hair, and makeup. Also want to paint my fingernails dark red like my toenails unlike right now.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/CcimqfnoH_Y/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=

I wish I could dress like this but I don't have money for it right now 😭😭😭
I go back and forth between between wanting to look like a cute pixie and wanting to look like a vampire.
Nerdy suburban mom at home (the comfier the better) so lots of leggings, camis, and some of my old graphic tees...but with boobs now lol.  At work and in public I'm starting to veer into more hard femme elements as I see the changes and get more confident. Leather jacket, sundress, and combat boots is my next outfit goal.
Most of the time I'm going for Stiles Stilinski from Teen Wolf. But flannels in general is my fave. My goal is to one day wear more crop tops though.
What I want it to be: Black Thigh highs, Knee high boots, A pink and black Plaid skirt, oversized purple T-shirt with some black things on it (like a symbol or smth) and Round glasses.  


What it is: Oversized hoodies to kill my dysphoria.
Tight-fitting jeans, loose flowing tops, and nice boots.
I like femme shirts and flannel, sweatpants and combat boots, beanie or a ponytail in a scrunchy, lately I've only worn lipstick every other week. Perfect half rim glasses
I want to reinvent the 1950’s mens fashion. Keep it the smooth, clean and crisp lines with more modern pallets.
The cowboy aesthetic has got me good. 80s-90s fashion is pretty cool too
Dress 👗 with flowing knee length skirt
Bright green (not neon or lime, kind of like a vibrant seafoam) sundress, black leggings, some cute earrings, a flow pin in my hair to contrast with the dress, and some cute sandals
Based on my personality and general attraction to the color black and also the generic witch vibes my wife has. I would say it's a solid bet for me to be the big tittyed goth girl of my dreams. lol
I'm currently streetwear/sweats cuz they help banish disphoria, but ngl I'd love to be able to do the khaki shorts, t-shirt, and open button up look cuz let's be real at my age dad aesthetic is a good and appropriate target. I need me some colourful button ups with dinosaurs on them
My wardrobe strategy is “Scooby-Doo Character,” everything in a consistent color palette so you don’t get confused about who I am when I’m not wearing my main outfit.
Sweaters and shorter skirts for me! Also, lots of days in jeans and t shirts.
FANCY SUITS FANCY SUITS FANCY SUITS FANCY SUITS
I want it to be fairy core, and maybe with some alt sprinkled in there
I currently present very mask but I kinda wish I could wear crop tops and skirts and still pass.😐

My transition goal is basically tiger from my hero academia to be honest😄
Anything teenage girl…basically teen Vogue, lol
sk8r gorl
Emo
honestly, ive been highly inspired by jhope of bts as ive been more recently developing my fashion~ been a lotta bright colours and oversized clothing ((the latter really helps with dysphoria since i can't bind much anymore))
A nice mix of cybergoth, classic punk, kawaii punk and scene. Maybe a little modern day alternative.
What I want it to be:goth/punk rocker girl

What my style ends up being: bright and cheerful anime girl
Oml I actually need help with this it’s always been a problem
i have no idea what i want to wear. it's a mixture of really feminine clothes but also like really dark colors. like i guess emo stuff
My wardrobe is entirely either grunge, or slut.  Sometimes they combine.
Ohh im more ""casual "" but leather jacket ripped jeans and heeld anckle boot.
Cottagecore is my favorite aesthetic 💖
Simple: Girly-girl
(not sure what I did but I accidentally deleted my first comment LMAO)

I don't have a specific style personally, I dip into pretty much anything between grunge skater and vintage art student. Most of the time it ends up as an eclectic mash up, and it changes depending on how masc/fem/androgynous I'm feeling. I love using getting dressed as a way to play ""character customization""cause I get so much euphoria from looking at the cool outfit I've come up with on any given day.
I desperately want to be one of those gym baddies, wearing the top + yoga pants combo to show off the amazing booty I'm cultivating.
Techwear/cyberpunk clothing. If we're gunna live in a dystopia might as well dress like it.
(Not to be confused with warcore or darkwear) I tried being more ""alt/fem"" but  pockets, being comfy, and unrestricted movement is so much better.
 Love how functional everything is too.

 ...my wallet not so much 😅
Dark skirts/dresses with optional floral patterns (there is a previous post of mine in my favorite dress).

I have to wear pants at work (OSHA compliance). I hate wearing pants.
I'd love like a mix of Punk Rock Princess and like hippie boho i guess.... Like witchy but like punk rock princess astheic I know very weird. 

Hi I'm Jessie, I'm the defention of werid.
I keep having dreams where I’m smol and in fluffy dresses and skirts and it fills me with feelings I can’t describe
Cute ankle boots, ripped skinny jeans, and a light sweater or cute tee shirt .  Or sun dress with heels or sandals .  I have a shoe fetish!  I plan my clothes around my shoes. 🤷🏻‍♂️
Goblin core it’s like cottage core and dark academia with frogs I love it
soft pinks and greens, lots of high rise bottoms, lots of cropped tops. I just need the right pieces for those colors for spring/summer (but to be clear I just prefer pink and green). in the winter, I wear lots of black. I love my trench coat. still figuring out fall
I wanna be the stereotypical bi girl with the docs and all that, and probably a slightly goth aesthetic but not fully goth
Anything revealing yet teasing .. Flirty i guess?
Also i like flowy dresses with tiers. And waist shaping/ accentuating because I'm built like an apple.
Green goth, Like natural colors but with a goth look to it
Goth mixed with long dresses
Tons of hoodies. And skirts too. Hoodies and skirts.
A black cardigan with a white t-shirt and dark blue jeans. Something like that maybe
Preppy and alt. I also love things with hearts on it. I like pink and black. Oh and I love mesh stuff.
I currently wear a lot of loose and baggy clothes because of ✨dysphoria✨, but I'd like to wear skirts, tights, and stockings more often. I'd also like to get more masc clothing because i don't have much, probably like ties, long-sleeves dress shirts, slacks, and also suits in general because I just like the vibe.
idk what it's called but something with ties/ribbons/oversized jeans and kinda alt
Jackets
Hoodies
T-shirts
Cargo pants
Sweat pants
Dresses
Skirts
Sweaters
Scarves
Long hair
Short hair

In short, **yes**
oversized button up shirts. tapered cargo pants. suspenders. doc martens and other similar boots. waistcoats. fingerless gloves. heavy metal chains. 3-7 necklaces, with large pendants. long dangling earrings. thumb rings. dark, muted tones. ""masc"" eyeliner. 

i want to tie in more ties (pun intended), lace, fishnet/other similar textures, 1920s aviator boots, suit jackets, other kinds of gloves, collars.

I'd say my aesthetic is somewhat grunge with a bit of vintage, as a general category. I've been getting more into alt and goth lately so I kinda want to explore that more, heh.
I have multiple things in mind



One is pretty casual and like mainly ripped 90's style jeans with colorful sweatshirts, hoodies and any cute tops with ruffles. Also converse shoes and any cute accessories




Other is like a kinda preppy and goth hybrid with a lot of dark colors and chains and tons of jewelry and platforms.




Probably gonna go for a weird mix of these two idk yet
Me too 🥰
yea, I'd love a black hoodie with a nice medium-sized skirt
***GOTH GOTH GOTH GOTH***
Omg sammmme, but kind of a soft goth, without too much of those satan thingies
I exclusively buy my clothes from Dolls Kill and can firmly say that Emo/Goth is entirely my style 😍😎🖤
same!!!
Literally same 😩 
My face ruins so many cute outfits for me
lmao
Good one!
Plaid stuff is some of the best to wear if you have to dress gender neutral or agab for something. Literally my plaid shirt is the only item of clothing that survived my wardrobe transition aside from a couple of backup tees that don't look too masc. It goes so well with my spinny skirt lol and can be tied around my waist for DIY skirt too
Same for me😪 imma wear the cutest hoodies though😋
turtlenecks!!!
Before transitioning I was addicted to fancy to do type mens outfits. I love fashion. I’m excited for you :)
Dark academia is such a nice style, But it's so hard to get right sadly
what's boho? i keep seeing people talk about it but cant figure it out lmao
You will always hear ""grunge,"" ""emo,"" ""goth,"" etc. Punk rock is about doing what you like. You can't expect others who don't understand punk to ever get it right.

Doing what you like is punk rock. Looking how you want is punk rock. Being trans is punk rock. what is punk to you is all that matters. Go out there and be punk rock. 

And check out ""Transgender Dysphoria Blues"" by Against Me! If you haven't already.

Laura Jane Grace is my punk rock heroine.
Bright colors that clash help, find your favorites and go crazy. punk is an artform only you can own😉❤
This is me right here.  My mom says I dress ""like a bum"" because 99% of the time I just throw whatever on and it doesn't quite match.
I love that
Kinda this. snapback, denim vest or hoodie covered in patches, leggings, cammo cargo skirt, boots is more the less the go-to. Also wear a lot of jeans.
society don't want me to be happy tho
Social shirts with skirts is a good example 🙃
i think blogilates on youtube made a custom hoodie based on that so maybe check that out
Or like hyper feminine lol

Right now I mainly wear jeans, t-shirt and hoodie because I don’t have effort in the morning
Plus hiding your face is part of the astheic 👉👉
Foxblood.com for babes who wear black 

All of their stuff is print and logo free and made out of really good fabrics. My friends and I can't stop buying their stuff tbh
I'm trying to go for a goth/grunge/alt style
Lots of cute clothes with leather and chains, mostly black
Satan thingies? You mean Baphomet? Or the Pentacle? Or ... ???
I’m more than fine with the occult imagery. But I’m also not soft goth/alt. I like blending what would be  casual clothing with clothes that have a bit of an edge.
I would love to be able to pull that off. Maybe Pastel Goth, preferably with a nice lavender and black outfit.
Bohemian
bright colors that dont clash with hints of emo cyberpunk streetwear techwear and goth/cybergoth
I mean I have the bright colors that clash part going on-
Saaaame tho! I only actually try to look like one type of alt when I’m doing something “important” (taking my dog to petsmart is totally an important event
[This triangle shaped one?](https://youtu.be/r1n6Q_w7OuY) Thank you for your suggestion, but that's pretty much the opposite of what I'm looking for. She said in the video she made it shorter than a men's hoodie.
Omg yes, thats my kind of jam, or i love a very aggressive style with spooky combat boots, and a top with chibis of baphomet or cute goth style figures
Yeah exactly, all those little occult thingies
ohh
Hells yeah 😘
You can't know without trying, gonna try me some weird combinations myself😆
oh D:
Ironically, the hoodie she's showing there as the worse example is what I want. Only that I'm taller than her so normal men's or unisex hoodies don't look like that when I wear them. Again, thank you though.
ah I did a stupid.. If u really want one, picking up sewing would be a good skill
No worries, man. It's bound to be useful for someone else. She sells those long sleeve crop tops OP wanted.

>If u really want one, picking up sewing would be a good skill

That's what I plan on doing. I just pick from all the hoodies I have the hoodie that fits best in all the other places, trace that and make a replica, only a little longer. Sadly I don't know jackshit about any of this. Apparently you have to use fabric in the right direction(???) and sewing itself is apparently not as easy as put needle in one side then in the other, like this ~~~~~ ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯

I've also been told that I'd need to seperate the parts of my hoodie to trace them and that would leave me with one hoodie less than what I started with if things don't go well.

So I'm procrastinating. I have tutorials lined up for this stuff, but I just don't feel up to the task atm.
ok so to get a pattern, you could just duct tape the pieces of your hoodie without cutting it, then add seam allowance (keeps the seams from breaking)

Fabric stretches when pulled one direction and less the other, but if you don't do it right, I doubt it'll be that noticable, just try to get the sleeves going the same way probably.

Sewing itself can be pretty simple, you just put the pieces on top of each other (inside out), sew the seam leaving seam allowance, then you flip it and its done. On a sewing machine, you have to stick backwards at the end so that the end of the thread doesn't come apart

Arm holes are hard and I haven't done them yet, but there's tons of videos online

If you want to tailor it a bit, before you get the pattern from your hoodie, pin the places that you want smaller while wearing it and make the pattern longer at the bottom if you want

I've been wanting to make a shirt, but have been procrastinating too lol
Thank you! That helps a lot, actually. If I ever get to doing that, I'll send you a picture. I wouldn't hold my breath tho.
I think you should, it'd be a good project :D I'd love to see it if you do"	u6rcyc	trans	512	0.99	2022-04-19 00:00:13
Need a second opinion. Would I be in the wrong for this?	"I have a very Christian/Conservative family and my father is very transphobic. I came out to my parents almost 7 months ago my mom isn’t supportive but she supports my right to be who I want to be. My dad however had some things to say about it and wasn’t very nice about it to the point where I moved out for my own mental health. I know he cares about me but he’s very stuck in his ways and hates that I’m trans and “doesn’t believe” that I am. He had previously asked me to show up as “deadname” to holidays which I have abode by every time I’ve showed up around him and the rest of my family. I’ve let them deadname me and misgender me hoping that they will come around eventually. 

Well this coming Easter Sunday I want to show up as me. I want to paint my nails, do my makeup, and wear what I want to wear. I have asked a friend to come with me that my parents are familiar with to keep me comfortable and be there to support me. The only thing is that my grandparents will also be there. I have not come out to them yet and don’t know how they will react. It’s not my intent to stir drama but I have a feeling that it will. I only want to finally stop caring about what my family says or thinks about me and make a point that this is who I am and im no longer going to just roll over. 

So my question is would it be inconsiderate to come out to my grandparents this way and to possibly “disrespect” my father by showing up in my girl clothes when he asked me not to? Especially since it will be in front of his parents as well.

[UPDATE] post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/u6mp4k/update_post_i_did_it_i_went_to_easter_as_myself/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for anyone who’s curious how it went :)"	"If they’re inviting “deadname” they haven’t been inviting you. Rude. Time to crash the party. It’s only stirring drama if they choose to be dramatic about it.

Provided you’re reasonably sure you’ll be safe, of course. But that’s my only issue.
Show up as you. You're living independently so he can't do anything in retaliation. It is not inconsiderate. And if you embarrass him- he's an ass, so that's a win.

&#x200B;

That being said might I suggest you and your friend go equipped with 2-4 cans of pepper spray each to act as a painscreen (like how destroyers used to be able to make smokescreens) in the event of the need to retreat because the crap has hit the fan.
I support you going as yourself and you deserve to live authentically in the presence of your family as well.

I would consider if that's truly the way you want to come out to your grandparents. While I think it's great that you're being yourself, transitioning is big news and it would be kinder to them if you would tell them beforehand.
I would normally reply to the person who replied before me as I do agree while heartedly with their statement however, it does need to be said that you may not be allowed entry into their home when doing that. As from your explanation it sounds like that household is very much run in the ideals of Christianity meaning your father/sire holds all the say ( to explain the use of sire; I don't like calling people who don't support their children their parents, he's just the sperm donor in my eyes, don't mean any offense and I'm sorry if it does offend )

You are you, you are valid, if you are capable of living in your own than there's no reason to be involved with toxic people and that's exactly what those two are doing, it's completely different if they are trying to accommodate you and just messing up, that's growing pains, but they don't sound like they WANT to try meaning it's toxic af.

Having a friend with you is a good idea, when I first came out it was too people I knew wouldn't change how they treated me, just respect and support me, then I went to everyone else with those people help as I myself don't have a very strong backbone but having them there with me was very helpful and they sometimes pushed me to be more assertive and to stand my ground.

I hope for you, you have people like that in the friends you have and I also hope that your family comes around to at least respecting you for who you are. I'm rooting for you ( and I'm sure there are many more on here ) on my end and remember we are always here if you need.
Your father is the one disrespecting you for being who you are, not the other way around. There is absolutely nothing disrespectful about being and presenting as yourself. If you showing up as yourself creates a scene, they're the ones creating that scene, not you. They're the ones choosing to react poorly. If they truly supported you, there would be no scene to make. Be yourself, but don't put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation.
If you think its feasible, you might want to tell your grandparents first so it's not as much of a surprise.
You need to decide if you want to keep your family in your life. If you do then go as yourself IF YOU FEEL IT’S SAFE. Your safety is top priority. If you feel that you are safe there then go and if anybody gives you any problems then you have every right to leave and not speak to them again. It’s a sucky situation but it is part of the path for some in this day which is awful but hopefully you have a support network that can help if things go bad. 

If you don’t feel safe going then I would seriously consider whether or not the pain that your family beings you is comparable to the joy. If the cons outweigh the pros then it is time to cut ties. The constant negative comments build up in you over time even if you don’t realize it.
No doubt your father will claim it is. It's not. He has, in fact, been deeply disrespectful to you by demanding that you hide your identity around him and pretend to be somebody you're not for his sake.

That said, if you're stable and safe on your own and not dependent on your parents for survival, I might recommend instead presenting him with a choice: you can come as yourself, or you can skip visiting. Make it clear to him that continuing to fake being a boy for his sake is no longer an option.
If you don't show respect, you have no right to demand respect.  

Your father doesn't respect your identity and accepts that his behavior will have a negative impact on your mental health. With your father's lack of acceptance, he worries about himself - his world view must not be shaken, his (family) environment should not connect him with a transperson etc.

It is absolutely the right decision to be yourself. You deserve this and no one should take that away from you.  It's important for mental health not to keep hiding - especially not in the place where you should feel safest and most comfortable, which is your own home. I really wish that your parents will understand this and realize that it is their job as parents to support you and not to deny you for the sake of their own convenience and reputation.

I wish you the best and a good time being yourself ♥️ be the girl you are.
Good luck! I'm sorry that your parents aren't more supportive.
I’d say not go…. Just text them or call them… something like:
“Sorry, you have the wrong number, this is ‘your name’ you called for someone ‘deadname’ never heard of them. But hey. I’m open to come over if ya want.”

Maybe I’m just mean but that’s maybe stick it to them….
You should go as you. It’s not your problem if anyone has a problem with it. 

If you are really concerned with stirring things up on the holiday have you thought about coming out to your grandparents a couple days before?

Either way you deserve to be happy and not be you because other people are ashamed, it’s their issue not yours.
I gotta say this is a difficult situation. one thing you could try is saying you’re not coming and instead maybe celebrate Easter with friends who actually treat you with the respect you deserve? or maybe call or text your grandparents before Easter to tell them that you’re trans, or only that you’ll go dressed as your true self?
Personally, I'd tell your dad ""I'll show up as me or not at all"", and end up not going given his likely reaction. But I don't think you're in the wrong to show up as yourself.
> I’ve let them deadname me and misgender me hoping that they will come around eventually.

Unfortunately, I've never seen a situation where this kinda of tactic works. People are gonna continues to do what they are comfortable or familiar with, until they are forced to change. That goes with any behavior really.  
He's not gonna change his behaviour until he is slapped in the face with the reality of the situation. I had a similar situation with my Step-mother, and i drew a line in the sand, and cut them off until they came around. Sometimes you have to really show them the alternative, Losing you from their life, to truly show them that they need to change your behaviour.

Sounds like you are coming to that point. And if you feel you can do this safely i say go for it.   
It's definitely drawing a line in the sand, saying this is me, and you either accept me as me, or you get nothing. I honestly think its the only way you might get through to your family. Which sucks, but is an unfortunate reality. 

I wish you the best of luck, and stay safe.
Tbh I just wouldn't go unless they wanted you there as you. Wanting you there as someone else isn't what a loving family does. You deserve better 💜
I came out in a similar situation, by which I mean your story sounds incredibly familiar. How to dress for family events was a fraught issue for a long time, until I finally just said screw it, I'm doing what I want.

My view on your situation is this. You have every right to show up as you. Period. This is a hard won realization for me, and I wish I had known it sooner. It sounds like you're fully aware of the potential response and are making plans to mitigate it. If you're going in with full understanding of the situation, there's no reason you shouldn't wear whatever is appropriate for you gender on a holiday like that.

In the end, I've learned that people will respond how they want to and you can't control that. But you don't owe it to anyone to pretend you're something you're not. I know in my case it just never got brought up. Literally no one has actually commented, but I come from a family who avoids conflict. God luck and I wish you the best. I'm sure you'll be beautiful! ❤️
I just wouldn't go, if they ask why, tell them you will come when they are ok with you just living as yourself.  If they can't get past their egos, she accept you for you, you are better off not being around them anyhow.
I say go. If things turn south, you got your friend there to help you out. You are absolutely NOT in the wrong for wanting to be yourself around your family and your grandparents are gonna find out eventually anyway. Make sure to keep us posted if you want do we can try to comfort or congratulate you (whichever is needed). Good luck!
>possibly “disrespect” my father by showing up in my girl clothes when he asked me not to?

Respect goes both ways. Your father is being a twat and not a good Christian
Go go go!! Be yourself. You've spent enough time lying to yourself to please other people
He’s disrespected *you* long enough. Time to turn the tables sis
No party crashing. I'd suggest reaching out to your grandparents and come out to them directly. It'll make the in person at home confrontation a little less intense.
Call your grandparents and come out over the phone, tell them that you're going to come as the real you.
Yes, ruin their Easter, fuck what your parents think.

It's totally reasonable to be you but I don't think it's the moment to come out to your grandparents. It may be that your parents already told them but I would call th or send them a message beforehand. If it's already clear your grandparents won't be supportive or at least just let you be it might be wise to not go.
Revised opinion- just don't go, cut off all contact with the scum.
i would warn you that thats probably gonna start something but it might be the move you need to make 

i went through a year and a half of pain solely trying to rebel and do what i please and it worked

i had to ignore my parents for months in misery because i had a taste of what i wanted but i couldnt do it 

u could make a statement and with a bit of distance and making sure ur safe ur dad will come around
[removed]
I think you should always just be you. I will just say that you should prepare for this to be a BIG blowup, as this is a religious holiday, for the religion that they credit for not believing you. They may see it as offensive that you chose thier holiday to come out and be yourself, so please prepare yourself and keep yourself safe.   


You might want to let your Grandparents know before they show up. This is a big emotional reveal and it could go a long way to smooth the holiday out.
Don't let anyone stop you from being you. Any decision made out of fear is a bad one.
DO IT
I don’t think it’s fair that he has tried to put who u are into a box.

I think u should be you. No matter what u should always try to be you!
Inconsiderate, well perhaps, since it would be an interesting public situation in which to out yourself to your extended family. Would I do it in your case, probably yes, but that's just me. I think the tiebreaker considerations would be, what is the potential fall out if it all goes south, and do you have a safe exit strategy if everything else falls apart.
Show up as you if you father really gave a shit about you he wouldn't pull this shit. Be yourself if they don't like it they will just not be a part of your life and that is their loss.
They’re being inconsiderate of your feelings. Quid pro quo I say. You shouldn’t have to stifle who you are to appease anyone. If it causes drama then that’s their hang up, not yours.
Honestly, if your grandparents are not a threat I will come out to them in private and ask their permission. If they support you than your father can eat sh*t.
If you feel bad for showing up as you, which you shouldn't feel bad about, text them before you come. Then you have at least ""warned"" them
If I wanted to come out to somebody, I do it privately, first. People seem to appreciate it, and those that have the mental capacity seemed honored that I trusted them and took the time for just them. Humans don’t always react well to shock and awe, but if you must do it, I hope you’re prepared for for the fallout. If I were a cousin or an Auntie you liked and got along with, I would feel hurt if you’d lumped me in with the other assholes at the gathering that knew nothing. I understand that everybody is at a different phase in transition in life, with varying needs. I hope it works out warmly for you, somehow.
I would inform your mother of your plan, and make it clear to her that it's either that or not get to have you visit for the holiday. Be polite, but absolutely firm. If they are going to keep being in your life they need to do so on your terms.

Were you still living at home and or if you are financially dependent on them the situation would be different, as keeping yourself safe (fed, roof over your head, etc...) takes precedence.
i see a lot of people saying go as you, and i agree, but i want to be brutally honest. i don’t think your family is going to react in the way you hope and i think you need to be prepared for the backlash that this could cause and you need to be prepared for them to essentially blacklist you. i don’t think there’s a world where they accept you w open arms. at least not immediately. this will take time. good luck
Show up as who you are. Your asshole dad is the one in the wrong
Personally, I’d say if at all possible come out to your grandparents beforehand, would probably be better to give them the chance to have their own reactions to it without your dad being there.
show up as you!! stay safe though <3
You could always shoot your grandparents a message and come out to them first before showing up, so you can gauge what type of reaction to expect before showing up.
How could it? Thats you. If anyone in your family has a problem with that fuck them.
Show yourself how you wanna show yourself. You have a right to be yourself in front of the people you care about/who care about you.
Do you rely on your parents for financial or other forms of support?  If so, you may want to consider the possibility of getting cut off just to prove your point.  

What harm is there letting your parents and grandparents know that you wish to join them as yourself or you will respectfully decline participation in their holiday?  

Coming out to shock the family may not be all it is cracked up to be.  I’m guessing you have better people who you can spend the day with than your birth family, if they won’t accept your true aspirations for yourself.
I avoid confrontation, so I would avoid doing this. And, especially with conservative/christians/religious people, Im terrified of them - because they can do anything they want as long as they interpret it as justifiable to 'god', which people have used for thousands of years to do awful, terrible things in the name of whatever religion.

But hey, if you think you can pull it off and have a good time, sure
I think you’re in the right but you need to be up front about your plan.  Be mater of fact.  This is who I am and how I am willing to show up.  If that’s not enough for your parents they may prefer you not come and I think you have to accept that too.  While you don’t agree with their intolerance it’s wise to respect barriers.

If you show up I think coming out to to grand parents is a given (if your presentation doesn’t out you,  maybe you could decide not to come out to them but IDK
Cis female here - whether you go as yourself this weekend or later on it’s going to happen and at least one family member is going to react poorly it seems. It’s going to emotionally hurt on some level and maybe long term. Have you thought about counseling? Not because you need it but to start speaking with a professional about all possible outcomes to interacting with your family as yourself? You can brainstorm and role play and build a tool chest for yourself for when youre in the moment. Best part of starting now is if you receive negative responses of any kind you’ve already built a report with someone and it’ll be easy to work through your emotions in the moment and not having to back track in order to move forward.

I suggest this because I have icky in-laws and I’m in counseling now preparing for how to deal with them moving forward. I love it! She’s given me amazing ideas including forming boundary lines and when to react vs walk away.

Good luck!! Also, bringing the friend is an amazing idea! Stay true to your self and having back up is setting yourself up for success!!!
I am so sorry that you are so manipulated that you think you have to abandon who you are for your dad to love you. I hope you just don't go personally, that's either self harm or putting yourself around a bunch of people who probably are heavily anti trans based on your post, but if you do, remember that it is insanely disrespectful to you for them to ask you to alter any part of yourself to go to their little get together. They disrespected you already, and waiting for them to suddenly respect you will never work, unfortunately. If you genuinely feel safe there, I hope they come around and realize you're much happier and better to be around as yourself, and if you do t I hope you don't go :)



Edit bc I'm Like This: I realized the beginning of this is. Very condescending. And that wasn't my intention lol. I just meant that it sucks that you feel the need to hide so he will be ok with you. Sry 4 projectn 😔
Maybe you could give them a call so they'd be at least... less surprised when you show up?
He doesn’t love you he loves “deadname”
Yeah sry just cut the threads and never talk to them unless they except who u are.

Its no good for anyone.
Yk what I do. I just don't respond to my deadname lol
You won't be the one being disrespectful, it's your family being disrespectful by not being more accepting of who you are
Honestly? Is having them in your life making you happy? Or is it just holding you back? It seems obvious that they're never going to respect who you are. I'd say just don't go at all. If they won't respect who you are, and are telling you to pretend to be someone you aren't, they don't deserve your respect either.
Fuck em. You’re an adult. Be yourself.
Yeah and the last time I talked to my dad he got pretty angry and said “so I guess my son is dead” which I responded “yep.” My main thing is if they might paint me to be the villain to the rest of the family. I’m not really scared of anyone being violent towards me just the emotional damage they could do
Yep, safety first. Might I suggest parking in an easy launch position so you can get in, slam on the gas and GTFOD
Haha I like the idea of carrying a smoke screen around with me for protection. Someone being mean to me? Smoke screen! Being harassed? Smoke screen! Get too embarrassed to show my face? Smoke screen! 

I definitely want to go as me.. this is just really scary and I don’t wanna lose/upset my family 😅
Alternatively hit them with torpedos and 4inch guns like destroyers
That’s really the only thing holding me back. I’m not sure if they have an idea or not I mean I haven’t done a lot to try to hide it. I dyed my hair red, I haven’t really hidden my voice since I started to practice and I’ve definitely acted more and more girly around them. They just haven’t officially been told really. I’d tell them before hand but I honestly think I’d have an easier time just showing up. I thought about calling them but to call them right before Easter Sunday? If I’m to be the talk of the day I might as well be there right? I dunno this is all so confusing and hard >.<
Eh, kindness is overrated in this situation, the father at least is a jerk and where do you think he got it from?
Thank you! <3 
And yeah honestly at this point I shouldn’t care but my heart is a bit too big and I can’t help caring about people I care about. Even if it hurts me. :’(
I’m certain I’d be in no physical harm. At worst I could have a panic attack but I have meds for that
Aww hehe thank you :)

And honestly if I go through with this I might have to accept the fact that I’ll never have a home there again. Hopefully not though! While my dad is very opinionated about it I at least have a supporting sister, and my mom MIGHT defend me if I’m lucky haha
That was kind of the idea, like just stop listening to him because it honestly might be making it worse? If he always gets his way he’ll never have to try to change for me.
Yeah :( think I might test the waters and if it goes horribly I just won’t show up anymore.
I most agree with this sentiment. If they don't want you there as yourself, it's not worth the discomfort. We give people so many chances to disrespect us and there needs to be a certain point when you just set your conditions and walk away.
I won’t be in any physical danger they aren’t violent just unsupportive
I have no interest in being edgy. I feel it would be more rude to no show. And the risk is why the pepper spray.
Already went through therapy thank you :)
I’m not sure. While I know they wouldn’t support it they’re just a bit more mellowed out in their older age so I’m not sure how they’d react. I’m just terrified I might make them cry 0_0
[removed]
Yeah unfortunately I know I have to expect it :/ honestly I would have done this on my birthday but nobody invited me to do anything on my birthday this year
I don’t think they will fully support me. They’re more the type to be quiet about a matter and then talk allll about it when who they’re talking about isn’t around
I’ve thought about this. Giving my mom a warning.. mainly because she’s sort of the middle ground between me and my father and it might benefit me to give her a heads up. Although she will probably heavily suggest against it only because she doesn’t like drama and having to deal with it. I don’t blame her I just feel bad because she’s stuck in the middle with not a clue on what to do :(
Oh Im fully expecting them to have something to say about it. Hopefully they will have enough courtesy to just ignore it and not blow up on me :)
i wish you luck my dear<3
What others think about us is beyond our control. All we can do is be ourselves so that the people that do love us as we are - can find us. 

My hair is a neon colour. Sorts out the people that will never like me real quick, and it's like a flag so that those that will like me can see & find me easily.

You are fabulous, there will be many people throughout the planet that will adore you
His son isnt dead. His son never even really existed. If he is too stuck in the past to see what hes got on his hands, he can learn what its *actually* like to lose a child. You dont need a chance, he does, and this is his chance to get things right. If he cant, it may not be worth your time to try
They start lobbing shells, pop the ""smokescreen"" and leave
If this is how they treat you- they aren't your family. They're your genetic material pool. Family is a group of people who loves and cares for each other no matter what. Best wishes comrade.
Chosen family are amazing
There are 7+ billion people on the planet, find yours 💕
5 inch actually, least on Fletchers and Gearings
I understand that this is difficult. coming out to my folks was super difficult and fortunately my parents just spread the news to other relatives themselves (in the sense of ""look what my child is doing to me!!!""). Is it possible that they already know from your parents? would make things easier
I strongly encourage you to call them about it beforehand. It’s possible that your parents have already told them but given how your dad feels about it I’d imagine that’s not something he wants to share. If at all possible, it’s better for you to come out to them directly and give them the chance to be accepting of you before they have any interaction with your parents response to it.
This is common from what I have seen, we just need to learn to be a LITTLE bit more selfish. A lot of us have grown up knowing and hiding who we are for the sake of other people to the detriment of ourselves leading to a learned but bad behaviour of putting other people's comfort above or own ( I know not everyone is like this but it's common enough and I never said everyone @saltykeyboardspambuttheadswholurkintheforums )

Just need to redefine where you are willing to compromise so that you are allowed to be happy and comfortable even if that means updating a few people along the way; you're allowed to be happy and selfish ( just not completely selfish all the time, hope this makes sense )
I wish you all the best girl 💜
That’s good. Old people can be quite empowered and unpredictable though. Tread with caution.
[deleted]
I don't know their age but my experience with the war generation is thet they are very accepting. They've seen so much shit they mostly care about happiness. I'm speaking from a western European view though. I really hope you all the best and choose yourself over everyonr❤️
[removed]
Then don't mind my advice, it could be dangerous.
I think that you're a good daughter, and I totally respect not wanting to put her on the spot, but it does seem to me that it's the less risky method compared to you showing up all 'Girl Moded Up' and having your dad explode.
If you would feel worse not being there than being there and having to wear a disguise, then you can go in such a way as to 'please' your family. There will come a day soon (if not now) that that is going to likely be too unhealthy an option, but you will have to make that call. 
Quick aside, my elder son (he/they) came out 10 years ago at 17 in high school, and he moved out of his mom's house the day after he graduated because his relationship with her was so toxic. (Thankfully he and I never had those issues, though I can guarantee that neither of us expected that I'd follow suit a decade later! 😋)
Thank you <3
love the hair comment, never thought about it that way but very good thinking!
Forget the quotes, use an actual smokescreen. Throw down some smoke grenades and dissappear like they do in anime or whatever
This. Exactly this.
Your like an ad for happiness. Like those 'hot singles in your area' but real and not a virus 😂
Or 4.5 inch or 120mm or 100mm or 138mm or 130mm or 12 inch in one case
It’s possible! Honestly I think my grandparents might kinda have an idea anyways and just stay quiet about it for now. But that’s just a guess. They at least have to think I’m gay XD like anyone who doesn’t see at least that is totally in denial FOR me lol.
OP's safety matters more than gramp's levels of alive
Ah, yes. OP, be Batwoman
Hehehe!
I found my chosen family and they joy of it keeps spilling over 🤗
I hope OP can find the same. There *definitely* will be people that *chose* them too 🥰
Yeah lots of inconsistency
A destroyer with 12-inch guns?
hoping it goes well for you, best of luck ✨
[deleted]
If there is ever an option to be batwoman, be batwoman, unless you'd rather be batman or batenby.
The Soviet destroyer Engels had a 12 inch recoilless rifle installed
Bruh if gramps or the fam causes harm OP is acting in self defense. I'm not saying off the man, just that if you gotta make the spicy screen to be safe then do it. 

&#x200B;

I mean technically the better option is to not go but that seems more rude, to just no show.
Facts, tho for Batenby I'd personally just be ""The Bat""
Batenby sounds like some british royalty lord
I’m not going to pepper spray grandpa at the Easter gathering :(
Self defense typically only works in court if you’re a white heterosexual man being menaced by an intruder or by another man who is armed or otherwise much more threatening. Everyone should just cut off their transphobic families entirely ideally.
Or just ""bats"" like Joker calls Batman
""It's Da Bat!""
I'd be Batperson i think
Well I'd love to, but cutting off my family isn't cards for me right now.

&#x200B;

If Self Def don;t work then yeah just don't go OP.
If it was in the cards for me as an autist with no job, no health insurance, very little possessions and PTSD. I believe in you. I’m probably wrong and being too anecdotal but either way I wish you the best of luck."	u3nlej	trans	492	0.98	2022-04-14 18:09:18
Can I be trans without massive mental problems?	"hey \^\^

***I have the following problem after my last therapy session:***

My therapist doesn't wanna write my indication letter *(I'm from Germany, so I need this to legally get on hrt)* herself but rather wants me to get a second opinion by another therapist. As a reason she stated that my problem wasn't that of other trans people she had as patients and that she's unsure I'm even trans and not just a feminine guy.

Her usual patients are apparently very mentally unstable and can't keep a job or anything because of mental problems and I seem to be fine. I got a good job, moved into a new flat and got a fairly healthy social life. I have some dysphoria but it's not a life controlling amount, some days I can't get anything done because of it but most days I'm fine.

***She also said that I seem to have more of a social problem rather than the usual body problem.***

I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and chest area, according to my friends I can pass pretty well with makeup, fake boobs and tucking. I've been voice training for about a half a year now and my voice is not that far away from passing too. I seem to have naturally low testosterone so I got pretty lucky with genetics here.

I get massive dysphoria though when I go through the trouble of doing my makeup, finding clothes that look good on me, styling my wig and then still getting misgendered and deadnamed by my friends. It isn't as bad when I'm boymoding.

So did I just get lucky with my genetics or am I faking being trans because that's more socially accepted than feminine boys?"	"A cardinal rule of appropriate therapy is that the therapist not insist on their interpretation of reality versus the patient. That is improper use of clinical authority. Your therapist is bullying you into questioning reality: this is gaslighting. Terminate the relationship. Also, remember, therapists can have anxiety too. **A practitioner's own anxiety is usually the root of a refused letter, not a conviction about you or the truthfulness of your trans identity.** You are welcome to ask your therapist: ""I am confused. What is the threat that is preventing you from writing this letter for me?"" (ask in a calm, curious, playful, and polite tone and politely excuse yourself from the exchange if you feel yourself growing angry or losing control or if she starts gaslighting you: ""Thank you for the information/your opinion"" is a good stock response, and you can repeat it until she backs down). **Do not apologize or say sorry during this exchange!** See what she says and how she reacts! This person is a paid service provider, not an unquestionable god and if she can't handle that question skillfully then...ummmm...not to be reductionist but she may be a suboptimal or substandard therapist. I have met many professionals who are doctoral level (PsyD, PhD, MD) who are suboptimal, especially behind closed doors. **Do not blame yourself or start questioning yourself, people are generally self-motivated.** Good luck!
Hey there! Im so sorry, you should definetly seek another therapist because your current one is heavily transphobic.

An Indikation for hormones in germany can be issued in the first session, there are no requirements. Among therapists who actually know their stuff its more of a formality than anything else, YOU decide whether or not your trans and what you want to do with your body
You don't need dysphoria or to want to change your body to be trans, your therapist is very ignorant. A feminine boy will still want to be a boy, usually with strong certainty
there are a lot of us in stable jobs, in good living conditions :) 

&#x200B;

change your therapist.

&#x200B;

(Plus the indikation letter is not a legal thing, more a thing, that doctors want to be save for regress, technically all doctors can prescribe HRT on private base (except dentists))
Why be a feminine boy unless you WANTto be one? If you were marooned on an island  with only you for ever,  what would you like to be?
Nah, you're trans if you want to be.

Gender is arbitrary, there is no medical approach that'll work 100% of the time. The fact that you would seek out HRT in the first place or even try to pass as a woman ever is good enough reason for me to believe you're trans.
So, people are very complex, and a therapist should understand that. Its certianly not uncommon for trans people to have mental health issues, however it is not necessarily a requirement, and the severity levels vary. I myself am trans, and have some pretty complicated mental health issues, but I go to school, in the summer I keep a job, and while I struggle to do these things and go about daily life, I find myself having the ability to still do them. In a similar vein, therapists have doubted my depression because of the reasons I have listed. 

But people do not fit into models, and while these models can be useful for diagnosis purposes, they should never be absolute. You and your journey is valid, no matter what. However that does not help much in your situation. I don't know much about German trans laws, but I do know that getting a second therapists opinion has been nothing but beneficial to me for other mental health reasons.
Yes you can. If your therapist thinks you need serious mental problems in order to be trans, you should get a new one.
Wait, what? Do you have to be mentally ill to be trans? That sounds a little transfobic, in my opinion.
That’s ridiculous. If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself! Not something that a doctor tells you. I also know many people here in America who have or had terrible dysphoria, body and social, who were able to keep a brave face and be functional despite their struggle. It’s absurd to say that you can’t be trans because your life hasn’t been torn apart.
Yeah you can be trans without massive mental problems.

To be fair I didn’t think I had problems until I started peeling away maladaptive coping mechanisms…
Not all trans people are going to experience being trans the same way. If a therapist doesn’t understand that they should not be involved in gender affirming care.
There is no set requirement to be anyone. Be the person you want to be. It’s unfortunate that most people can’t be who they are, but don’t tear yourself down. Build yourself up and help others build their own confidence as we all need someone who is willing to reassure the truth. You matter, you’re a beautiful person, and you’re supported in this lovely community. Live by the sage words of Mister Rogers “won’t you be my neighbor?”
Yes. Most mental issues that trans people experience are tied to their experience with how others treat them in base of how they perceive them.
wow thats just, straight up terrible transphobia... wow
Sounds like your therapist is just a little ignorant. Yes, you can be trans without massive mental problems. In fact most of the time they prefer you to be some measure of mentally stable when you start HRT.
I wonder how many more years this fucking gatekeeper mentality will be in place. I think anyone that can show they are mentally stable and properly informed as they make the decision to change their gender it should be allowed to receive care affirming their desired gender. It's sad that this therapist seems to indicate you have to be on the brink of suicide or unable to conduct day-to-day life unless you had affirming care in order to move forward. All that does is put stress on people that happen to be fortunate enough to be managing OK (for the time being) until they are able to begin gender affirming steps.
I'm in America so not sure if this is super helpful, but the APA specifically recommends against the kind of gatekeeping your therapist is doing. This is called transmedicalism and the quote from the APA speaking against this ideology is,""TGNC identities can be healthy and self-affirming and are not inherently pathological"". Gender dysphoria is a pathology and is therefore not inherent to being transgender.
This is bull:
She still follow the Benjamin scall that is outdated on scientific publications.

For an history on trans classification:

[here](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)

(I know it take the DSM as an example (damn AmeriKan) but the international science consensus go in the same way).

To be simple: you don't have to be textbook dysphoric to be trans, mild or no symptoms are enough if you identify differently as your AGAB: you are trans, period.
not all trans people are the same. your therapist cannot hold a view of ""all trans people are unstable because they are trans"" because it is not true.

edit: typo
Es tut mir mega Leid für dich. Ein Tip hätte ich da für dich selbst ""nicht spezialisierte"" Therapeuten können dir eine Indikation ausschreiben lassen. Das habe ich bei meiner damaligen Therepeuten gefragt ""für einen Freund"". Vorallem in einem Umkreis von 100km müssten welche da sein. (Aber guck das sie dementsprechend nicht konservativ eingestellt sind bzgl deiner Indentität)
Ich selber bin erst am 1. Schritt ein Überweisung zu bekommen von meinem HA für einen Psychotherapeuten. Und ich hab auch diese Angst die du teilst nicht eine Indikation zu bekommen und das noch länger hinauszuzögern. 

Ps. I saved this post and Ill translate it later because Im not at Home right now
I’m just gonna say trust your gut, it knows you better than yourself. I don’t have any serious mental illness and I started my HRT while graduating from university and I landed a great job. My point is that being trans is not related to sever mental Illness and being a failure and unemployed. Follow your gut, you won’t be disappointed!
You absolutely can. I am so sick of this medical gatekeeping. Someone needs to tell these doctors that it's not the 70s any more. 

There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. It's transphobic bullshit. People aren't emotionally unhealthy because they're trans, they're emotionally unhealthy because the world treats them like garbage for being trans. The more trans people receive support from society at large, the fewer traumatized trans people there will be. 

Your doctor is working from outdated information, and clearly has some biases to overcome if they're going to be treating trans patients. If they wait for dysphoria to destroy your life before they offer treatment, then what's the point of the damn treatment? You have dysphoria. That's enough. 

As to whether you might just be a feminine guy,

         ""I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and.          
         chest area""

 If you were just a feminine guy, you probably wouldn't feel that way. 

I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed. 

Good luck! 💕
Your therapist is a dummkopf. Get estradiol and spiro from the internet.
She is transphobic and gatekeeping.

She doesn't have your best interest at heart, she wants you to be so distressed by dysphoria that you can't function in the world, before she will say that you are trans.

She got into her line of work to hurt people and keep functioning trans people from being able to access appropriate medical care.
I had a similar situation to you. I got 2 therapists, worked out great in the long run. I think you’re trans. And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something? Or she’s just stubborn
This whole ""more socially accepted than feminine boys"" angle is pure fucking cancer. Neither is socially accepted to any extent that makes ""more"" or ""less"" carry any weight, and it's literally always people who are gonna hate you either way saying, ""I'd rather call you a f____t than a t____y""

Doesn't really help your situation but this is what goes through my head every time I have this ""alternative"" presented to me by ""well-meaning but critical"" people. It's just not even close to a valid argument and if I heard it from a therapist I'd be reporting her ass to the oversight board for wasting my precious therapy time.
I had a good job and a nice car and had my shit together when I transitioned. The correlation between trans and being unstable seems kinda bigoted.
You dont need dysphoria or some kind of trauma. As long as you have a genuine want to be a gender other than your originally assigned one your trans
Hi I also live in Germany. I moved to Germany last year and I started therapy as soon as I had insurance.
I also have no mental health issues at all. I’ve never been depressed or had any anxiety or other common mental health issues allot of trans people experience.
My therapist had no problem writing my indication, I think you should just look for a different therapist.
Also if you just want to get a “Gutachten” done anyways, it will be beneficial for your “Namens- und Personenstandsänderung” if you plan on doing that. You are required to have 2 of those. I know they are currently talking about changing it to where you don’t need them anymore, but it will probably take a while for it to pass.
If by chance we live in the same area, I could give you my therapist’s information. 
Also if you are wanting to start HRT it sounds to me that you are sure about you being transgender. You should never have to “prove” to you therapist that you are trans, that’s just wrong on so many levels.
One of the biggest differences between something that is and isn’t a mental disorder in the DSM, is that the condition must cause distress and persist more than six weeks I believe.

Let’s reframe this through the lens of homosexuality. Someone who likes the same sex and doesn’t struggle wouldn’t have a disorder but would still be gay. Another person who likes the same sex but struggles massively with it because of societal values possibly would have a disorder. Both people are still gay, Just as two trans people one who struggles and one who doesn’t are both still trans. 

Its up to you to decide if your truly trans and if transitioning is a journey you want to go on :) hell i would even argue that your would still be trans and valid even if you never transitioned.
Yeah, crippling inability to function is definately not a requirement to be trans.

We're people like anybody else.
Don't question who you are because others don't want to accept you ❤️
Actually sometimes its the other way around, and they wont recoginize your transness bc you have other issues and they think that maybe they are causing your bad feelings. I feel like you cant win if someone else gets to decide if your trans or not.
That therapy is supposed to be assessing you for gender dysphoria which as a trans person you do have so that is very strange. Is it possible for you to get a second opinion from a different therapist?
Yes, you can. Get a new therapist.
I've struggled a lot in my life and being trans is only a small fraction of that struggle. I have ADHD, bipolar, massive amounts trauma and PTSD, anxiety, etc. Since transitioning my social anxiety and general discomfort with myself and my body have all but disappeared. It didn't magically erase everything, but it made dealing with the other shit much more manageable.

Transitioning should always be measured by how you feel about yourself after rather than how you feel before. If that doctor looked at me she may think I'm not really trans because I no longer hate myself and I'm much laxer with my identity and pronouns than I was when I first transitioned. In reality I've just reached a point where I hardly think about being trans anymore, and if I do it's not as this unbearable medical condition.

Now it's pretty much just one my traits. Y'know, _I like pizza, coffee, and I'm trans._ Honestly I wish I'd felt that way from the start. Being trans doesn't need to be debilitating for you to want to transition.
I am trans and I don’t have any mental illnesses
I’m like you where I don’t have very many mental problems and i can totally handle myself, but trust me, I am definitely trans.
Yes.

Source: me. It's a noted overlap (though I suspect this is in part trans peoples' willingness to self-examine and see mental issues as well) but there's no requirement.
Dysphoria is different for everyone some people don't even realize they have it as they have other issues that need adressed as well, such as depression and anxiety that may have been caused by dysphoria or may not be.

So the awnser is yes. If you plan to start hrt you should definitely think it over though, decide if you want to do this and if you turn out to be wrong, do you feel you could handle it.
I think getting a second opinion is the best thing to do. Therapists are just people too so maybe shes not sure what's the right thing to do in your case.
Ok, so I’m from Germany myself and no you don’t need to be a complete mental wreck to be trans, of course.
You seem to have a fair amount of problems/dysphoria regardless and it is, even though others might be worse of than you, still not something to be overlooked.
I’m fairly new to all of this (about 1,5 years now) but I experienced something similar with a Klinik I went to.
So I went there because I also have my fair share of mental problems and they didn’t really accept me as trans because apparently I didn’t conformed to the guidelines they have(?).
So maybe it’s that, again I’m not that far yet and haven’t been at the point of getting an indication letter.
It sucks though, only because you feel better than the other patients that you get written of as “not trans” even though you have dysphoria, at least from what I can gather, and when you ask yourself if you’re faking something you most likely aren’t.
So, I know this wasn’t that helpful, but I hope I could help a little bit.
The therapist problem is made worse by the fact that a lot of trans people fear being prevented from transitioning, and tailor the experiences they share with therapists in order to get through the gatekeeping process. So when someone like you comes by, who is very much within the typical variation of experience that trans people have, but doesn't try to conform, they can get worried.
So i went without help for my mental health issues for way to long because i had good grades and was doing okay. I finally got help after completely breaking down and being suicidal for 2 years. After getting help i realized how much i was suffering before.

I am doing so much better now and that is what allowed me to realize that i am a trans men. I could survive living as a women somehow but i learned form my last experience.**You don´t need to suffer in order to earn your identity or to prove you actually have a problem.** I knew i was not fine before my environment knew and i should have trusted myself to know myself better than other people.

I think everyone is different and you seem to have some advantages that her other patients might not have had like an supportive friends.

Also when my parents misgendered me before coming out it was okay but afterwards it made me feel horrible. Luckily they have adjusted by now and use my new name and pronouns.

Also faking is something you do on purpose and you know when you do it. You could be wrong about your identity, but that is something you know better than anyone else. Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?
It’s time to be forward to your therapist.Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy and this will be the last session unless they write you a letter for hrt. “ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”
She's sadly a bit uninformed. There's ALL kinda of ways to be trans. Some doesn't function at at all, while some function very well. Your therapist SHOULD know this. It's like someone says ""all people with autism is the same way"". Simply NO.
See, this is \*exactly\* the problem with treating gender dysphoria as a mental disease.

Apparently, you're not ""crazy"" enough to warrant therapy, never mind what \*you\* want.

But what if you were a cis woman, and didn't feel woman enough because, in your opinion, your breasts are too small? Then no one would argue ""Well, see, your breasts aren't small enough to warrant surgery"". No one would say ""Nope, no breast augmentation for you, you look fine! You're so pretty already!"".

Or what if you're a man and are balding and feel less of a man because of that? No one would say, ""See, you're not bald enough to get treatment"". No one would stop you from getting hair implants.

Or suppose you're a man and had a problem getting erections. Would anyone say ""Sure, but do you really need them anyway? You're not married and don't have a girlfriend, so why do you want erections?"" and bar you from getting Viagra?

So why is it OK for a doctor to go ""I don't think you're suffering enough, so I'm going to withhold treatment from you"" when you're trans?

So yeah, find another doctor, ASAP.
Weird the therapist knows what's wrong with your body than you do

How did they get that technology?

Are they gods?

 There are some people that shouldn't be medical professionals because they refuse to listen to the patients and think they know what's best without listening to what the problem is

Find a new therapist
Maybe it’s better to think of socially and medically transitioning as a choice one makes rather than a fixed “identity” ie something you “are” or “aren’t”. I would be deeply skeptical of those who tell you your therapist is bad for you for not encouraging transition. A therapist is there to help you determine what is true for you and decide with you what the best course of action for supporting your health. Transition isn’t “free”. There are social, mental, physical risks and costs associated with it and it’s NOT a panacea for your suffering. It makes sense for a therapist to help you turn over every stone in your psyche before encouraging transition. Be understanding of that. Beware of those telling you what to do or how to think because they’re trying to justify how they’re living their lives.
Yall are giving OP good advice and stuff and im just sitting here like 'Well that son of a dick face people can be metally stable""
My therapist specializes on trans people and she was the only one in a 100km radius from me that didn't have a year or longer waiting time.

I had my first session about a year ago while I was still questioning, so I got there in order to find out if I'm trans. Maybe she still has that image of my in her head instead of my current self.

She said I needed to do 12 therapy sessions and get the indication letter otherwise the endocrinologist will be able to deny me hrt.
From what i heard it usually takes 6 months to get the indication.

But i agree this therapist does not seem to be good. Her arguments reminds of the things people with adhd hear when they have good grades or can keep a job. It is weird how some therapist don´t realize that not everyone has to be exactly the same.
This might seem a bit self serving I'm sorry, but I'm also German and have genuinely no clue where and how to get to hrt, should I look for therapists 'specialized' in lgbt problems, does any therapist theoreticaly work? I looked some stuff up but couldn't really find what I'm looking for ;-;
Anyways, have a great day :)
I'm not really in a position where I can change my therapist without waiting another one or two years for hrt because the waiting times for therapists here are a year at minimum.

She said I needed 12 therapy sessions and the indication letter or the endocrinologist could deny me from getting hrt.
>Why be a feminine boy unless you WANT to be one?

I don't know, because my therapist says she sees me more as a femboy than a girl.

>If you were marooned on an island with only you for ever, what would you like to be?

A girl.
The problem with getting a second therapists opinion is that the spaces for therapists to be able to get paid by insurance companies is limited and the number of spaces haven't been changed in like 15 years.

So almost everyone looking for therapy has to wait a year or longer to get accepted by the limited number of therapists who can accept insurance parents.
Not her exact wording, but it was kind of what my therapist meant when comparing me to other patients of hers while doubting my transness
>If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself!

I was when I started the therapy a year ago. Right now tho I'm pretty sure that this is the right way for me.
I mean I have dysphoria, I'm just very good at hiding it and staying sane at the same time.

But I wonder how long I can keep this up..
Maybe I've overreacted a little in the title  
Her exact wording was more like ""You seem fine in life, usually my patients have other problems next to being trans, you seem to have more of a social problem than one with your body, so I'm not sure and I'd like to get a second opinion""
>There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. 

From what I've heard from my therapist it's not a thought up narrative of hers but her experience with trans people so far, and she's specialized on gender identity problems

>I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed.

thanks \^-\^   
I'm mostly scared that the second opinion will also deem me not trans and I'll have to go through yearlong waiting times for hrt while testosterone keeps on destroying my body.
Uhm, where would I get that?

Don't I still need to get my hormonal values monitored by a medical professional for my own safety?

And don't I have to do one year of ""official hrt"" to be eligible for srs?
>And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something?

She's supposed to be specialized on gender problems. 

My guess is that she's unsure because I've been with her for a year and I started therapy when I was still just questioning.
If only I could relay that want to my therapist.
Sometimes I feel like you can never win, like ever.

But yea our current system is pretty shit
I'm currently trying to but waiting lists are long in Germany.
>Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?

I wanna be feminine, I wanna be treated like a girl by others, I wanna be called by a feminine name and she/her pronouns, I want my penis gone, I wanna have boobs of my own, I want basically every side effect hrt would give me (less muscles, softer skin, more emotions).
>Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy

She didn't call me a femboy straightforward it was more like ""I think you might be more comfortable as a feminine guy rather than a trans woman""

>“ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”

Atleast it was free for me because of insurance. But I won't be able to ever get the time back.
I mean just because someone ""specializes"" sadly doesn't make them trans friendly. Its so sad that there are so few spots and the wait times are so long.

The fact that she is lying to your face is what worries me. The endocrinologist will not deny your indication with 1 or 100 sessions, they barely look at the thing. I know that since I got my indication after 30 minutes in my first session. I also know that since I study psychology and work towards becoming a gender therapist myself. The indikation can be issued by everybody without any requirements, it basically just says: ""Ey yo im a therapist and this person is trans"". And clearly your therapist doesn't think youre trans, which makes her uber transphobic. It doesn't matter what she thinks, this is just about how you feel

Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful
Yea, I think we now know why she was the only one in a 100km radius who doesn't have a lot of patients. 

Saying you have to have an inability to keep a job to be trans is just ... insane.
>100km

Have you had any luck outside that radius? Seems like a pretty restrictive distance, although I admit being from a semi-rural area of USA may skew my sense of distance a bit.
Darf ich fragen, wo du bist? UKM, also Münster oder wo anders? Denn es gibt echt recht viele Therapeuten die sich darauf spezialisieren und nicht nur von den Unikliniken sind.
Yes that is true, but that is not because of some medical or legal precedent. There is no requirement for an indication, and if your therapist refuses to give you one its not because they can't, its because they dont want to. 

And the reason they don't want to usually is because they have some old, transphobic views and simply don't believe their patient is trans when they tell them they are. Just like OPs therapist, whose even lying directly into their face
hey \^\^  
I found therapists close to me by talking to the [dgti](https://dgti.org/) counselor closest to me, I wrote an email to her and we made an appointment for her to tell me what I need to do and which therapists close to me work with trans people.
the endo can deny it on any reason he wants :) A good endo takes the indication and give you HRT. And a bad endo, that makes up rules, you should leave immideatly because the chances of getting wrong hrt are enourmos
Then you’re a girl, because why eff else would you choose to be a girl if you had to be stuck on an island by yourself? I think some therapists try the “feminine guy” bit because they know full on transitioning is probably the most difficult thing you will ever do. There are more dangerous things, and more heroic things, but with the amount of time and persistence transitions takes, few can compare. Maybe a moon rocket trip or something. Just getting rid of the beard is a five year ordeal. The “feminine” guy could maybe be persuaded to cross dress on the week ends, or wear a pink shirt and some little earrings (I dunno)…

I’m Older, granted, but I went in with the assumption I’d never fully pass, and I would not have sex with anyone ever again. And that I might live alone with my dogs for the rest of my life. I still did it. I am not suggesting that as anyone’s criteria, but keep in mind that that prospect is possible. I’m enjoying my life right now, I like my clothes, they are always clean and look nice. I am always clean, witH good hygiene, I don’t leave the house without my hair groomed, a bit of makeup and perfume. I feel better about being in groups of people even if I don’t pass. My way of interacting with people suits my gender now. Best wishes, R
Ah, well that's hella shitty. I'm honestly not sure what your options are, maybe there are organizations that help with that stuff? Other then that, I just wish you good luck.
Than it’s completely up to you! Don’t allow someone else to dictate what you want or need.
I donno. Different for everyone. I sincerely was doing fine until I wasn’t. Had to muck around in some scary mental health problems and sort myself out, deal with trauma I didn’t even know existed, honestly took the pandemic and shut down for me to slow down long enough to not disassociate through existence to notice the problems.
Blood values can get monitored by any medical professional, my family doctor is doing this in my case, also there are free labs you can go and let you blood check there.
no, look into the BGA (Begutachtungsrichtlinien des Medizinischen Dienstes der Krankenkassen), for SRS in Germany you only need 12 therapy sessions in at least 6 months, 1 year of being out in daily life (what counts as this is decided only by your therapist as they confirm that)

&#x200B;

Look in r/germantrans there is a post with all conditions pinned
Overseas pharmacies like AllDayChemist and InHousePharmacy. You skip the page where it asks for your prescription, and they look the other way. Sublingual estradiol tablets and spironolactone are what I get from my doctor here in the US. 50 spiro twice a day, 2mg thrice a day. The first few months were 2mg/day, the next few months were 4mg/day. Most of my dosage was decided by feeling. Your body knows when the estro is working, and when it's time to adjust dosage. Also, lab work can be done anywhere for any reason.
I don't know if you would be rejected for SRS over unofficial HRT, but I'd be mad as hell if they refused. Your therapist is an absolute jackass.
Your therapist is old and backward as well as transphobic, I'd complain to the governing body of therapists that she is not suitable for trans patients as well as transphobic and working from outdated standards
Yea, I feel like transgender therapy should be to aid the person, not to judge if they can transition. Who are they to stop a person from changing their own body. Such a thing inevitably becomes a political thing as well. (makes you dependent on the view of the random psychologist that you end up with, or whatever the definitions are that have been made)
They’re long in the US too but yeah I think getting a new therapist would be a good idea. And to let them know right away on the first day that you’re there to talk about gender dysphoria
i know some feminine guys and this is not something i have heard from them ever.

What you are describing sounds like you are a woman/girl and want others to recognize that and your body to reflect that.
Just tell her to give you the letter, that you feel insulted by her insinuating that you're not a girl and that you will be making a complaint against her
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

I mean what else am I supposed to do? She predicted I might get hrt by January if the second opinion has time for the indication until then.

In December, when I searched for therapists in a 100km radius to me, the next-shortest waiting time would've been until mid 2023.

If I need to wait another 2 years for hrt, I can't guarantee I'll still be stable enough to not off myself
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

Depending on what version of the DSM she's using, ""clinically significant distress"" can be listed an exclusionary criteria...it's an issue I've run up against.

Which honestly I think is bullshit; just because dysphoria isn't interrupting basic executive function doesn't mean it's not a problem for the person...
It's rather because she has no waiting list an I called her at the right time

She didn't say that trans people couldn't hold a job but she rather said that I'm suprisingly stable in comparison to other trans patients of hers.
I just didn't know how to word it better in English.
Koblenz, hatte bis jetzt Therapeuten angefragt bis Trier und Bonn
This is huge, tysm! :D
Well, my house doctor is now over an hour away from me since I moved and I heard that finding a new doctor is really difficult because they're terribly overrun and don't like taking new patients.

Also it involves calling people >\~< Because most of this fucking country hasn't discovered emails yet.
Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen. A life with an unbalanced endocrine system is a half-life. A life without estrogen is how Karens are born. Without estrogen, us women metamorphose into unrecognizable lycanthropic mawbeasts from hell.
Yea, I got to this one unsure of myself to explore my gender.  
Maybe she still sees me like that and is unsure because of that
I don't really feel like a feminine guy either. I'd rather just have myself replaced by a girl.

Plus I need to be deemed trans for half the things I listed like hrt or srs.  
If I didn't need to be trans for that I couldn't care less about the label people gave me.
Yea i don't know its a tough situation im so sorry. Its completly up to you how you handle this, shes taking away your dignity but i think if you get HRT in the end i guess who cares.

I am just worried, shes clearly not trustable so like who knows what happens in january even with a ""second opininon"". Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there? When its just a one time thing they can sometimes give you some time much earlier than the waitlists. Also if its only a one or two time thing you can look much further away than your usual search radius
I would classify a desire to transition that is so strong that denial of transition gives you suicidal thoughts as definitly and obviously ""distressed enough"". If your therapist is aware of this and still feels like you're not ""trans enough"" just because you're able to function most of the time, that therapist is either stupid or - more likely - just a bad person and worse therapist. Like, come on. From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

I don't know your exact situation, obviously, but I would try to impress on her how much hrt means to you and you deserve to get it one last time (it sucks that this is necessary, but so it goes). If that doesn't work, drop that therapist like a hot potato and try again with someone else. Also sucks, but again, so it goes.

Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, _especially_ if you're allready socially transitioning.

Good luck <3
Have a look at the list of therapists on the website Transmann e.V. (despite the name, it's not just for trans men). Some of them do remote appointments, I got my Indikationsschreiben about a week after emailing a therapist (making it clear I only wanted the Indikation, not ongoing therapy) from that list. It was a single 30 minute zoom call after which I had the indikation. I'm not sure what it's like if you're in a different state from the therapist, but you may have some luck looking near large cities, like Berlin.
Being so dysphoric you'd want to off yourself isn't enough for her to see you're under stress?
Just for the record, statements like “I won’t be stable in 2 years without hrt” and “there are ‘only’ some days where dysphoria is incapacitating” don’t strike me as particularly light dysphoria. Not that it’s strictly needed to transition anyways.
well yes ofc theres still alot of transphobia in the diagnostic manuals, but thats why someone labelled a ""trans specialist"" should know better. I could forgive this if it was just some uneducated therapist who just looked up gender dysphoria for the first time, but not someone who gets trans clients referred directly to them. Disgraceful
Utter billshit that is. None of my trans friends here have any major problems that would keep them out of work or school?

And the reason you got in quickly is that she sucks and loses patients all the time. So obviously new spots open up every week if she‘s this bad at her job.


The fuck? Whether you have other psychological conditions is completely irrelevant as to your gender dysphoria.


And you clearly list dysphoria caused by your body anyway.


And you don‘t even need bloody dysphoria to be trans in the first place.


That‘s such an outdated backwards gatekeeping bullshit she‘s spouting.


Try finding a Gyn etc prescribing hormones via private prescription in the meantime and start looking for s therapist that‘s fit to practice afterwards.


It‘s utter bullshit she‘s placed in front of you.


Also theres is the Germantrans subreddit as well :)

>Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen.

Same. For some time now I said I'd rather die to cancer as a 35yo woman than to old age as a 70yo man.
>Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there?

Don't I need to still do 12 sessions of therapy for the endocrinologist first?  
And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?
>From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

Well, I've been out everywhere except work for some months now. And that only because I want to wait for hrt before outing myself at work. The only reason I don't girlmode daily is because doing my makeup to the point of actually passing takes far too long and wigs are kinda uncomfortable.

>Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, especially if you're allready socially transitioning.

I've been told by my therapist and by the dgti representative that I needed to do 12 mandatory therapy sessions and depending on the endo I might need to do a year of openly living as a woman without hrt.

Also therapists slots to be able to bill insurance companies are limited and the number has been the same for like 15 years. Which is why the wait times are so horrendously long
No, it's fine  
I just wanted to complain that I have to get on the phone and call people
Absolute Queen.
Like i said, the 12 sessions of therapy thing is a lie. If you want 12 sessions to feel comfortable with everything thats completly fine and up to you, but you are not required to do that.

  
The Endo just wants the indication letter, and that letter can be written at any point, by anyone with a degree working in the field of psychology. I made an appointment two weeks before, got my indication in one hour, and went to the endocrinologist the same day. You are being medically gatekept and gaslighted

&#x200B;

>  
\>And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?<  


I think thats up to you and at what point in your life and transition you are. Having a therapist thats there for you is always a plus, but only if they are on your side
My doctor just referred me to an endocrinologist because my testosterone levels were so low and estrogen was so high. Apparently it’s to do with my pituitary gland, but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old
Oh geez. I'm sorry that really sucks. I guess my advice of insisting harder with your current therapist still stands though. Good luck <3 you'll get there
So you're telling me I could've been on hrt for the last year?  
I'm gonna go to the toilet at work now, cry my eyes out, and then go back to acting like it doesn't phase me.
>but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old

Me too but I never knew how to read the signs
Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted, on the contrary, i think if you talk to a therapist/psychiatrist who isn't transphobic the way you described your identity to us here, i have no doubt youll get your indication and hrt in no time. I still got super lucky, but thats because our system is fucked up and rigged. I just want you to know that what youre experiencing is def not proper procedure

Okay heres what you do: Don't ditch your therapist right away, but just give as many psychiatrists on [https://queermed-deutschland.de/](https://queermed-deutschland.de/) (if you have trouble navigating the website just ask) a ring as you can, describe your situation and just say that after youve been in therapy already for a while, you want an indication. Dont make a big deal out of it. One of them will give you an appointment.

Im sorry youre hurting, but i cant stand transphobic therapists acting like they have authority over you. You deserve so much better, everything will be fine❤️❤️
Neither did I, until I went to secondary school, and began wondering I would rather sit around with the girls and play when I was in my infant and junior schools. But you try to just shrug it off thinking it’s normal right? If you hang out with the girls one of them might get to like you. Then I realised it’s not just a girl meets boy thing but hang on, somethings not quite right! I couldn’t wait to get home from school and go get my sisters underwear out and put it on then to my mum’s drawer to get her forms, but after leaving school I fought and fought the girly thing, buried it deep inside but every now and then it would raise it’s ugly head and I’de be back to square one. I now have 3 divorces under my belt and my dysphoria is stronger than it’s ever been, every day I get up to have to get dressed up, problem is I’m still closeted. Went to the doctor and spoke to about my inabilities and he just referred me to an endocrinologist saying my pituitary gland is showing as producing more oestrogen than testosterone. We’ll see what happens on October 3rd and my appointment!
>Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted

Let's be real with ourselves, like the last 20 years of my life were wasted, but there's nothing I can realistically do about it so it's fine I guess.

But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<. Only the thought of having to call someone makes my palms sweat. And then there's these terrible office hours most therapists have which make them basically unreachable without taking a day of work.

I fear that the endocrinologist my therapist recommended to me might be one of the bad ones. But they're the only one I can find for Rheinland-Pfalz on the site you sent.

You think I'm good or should I rather try ones further away from me?
>But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<

Yea i feel that, i mean I couldnt do that either i legit had to go get my mom to make calls since i was out of mental energy after maybe two. If you got someone close to you that wants to help that could be handy! But yeah phone is torture i wish there was a different way. Just emalis and writing takes too long or you never get a response
Maybe you could ask a friend or someone you trust to make those calls for you?   


And yeah, it must be really frustrating that after all this time you've been lied to and could have progressed much sooner than you though. The thing is, now that you know better, you actually CAN progress earlier than what you thought earlier, and that is a positive, right?
I get you on the whole phone phobia thing, it’s why I didn’t make a doctors appointment for like 6 months🫠
Give this one a shot first, you never know! And if that one doesn't work out then try others. You can even make appointment with other ones in advance and cancel if the first one turns out fine to speed up the process
I don't think I can progress any earlier than right now. I have the earliest free appointment with the endocrinologist already. I just need to get an indication until december
How would I tell if that one's good?  
I don't know anything about hormones, he could tell me anything lol
Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Es ist zwar echt unnötig und nervtötend, aber HRT ist ne Riesen Sache für dich und deinen Körper, deshalb nur zu Experten, und nur zu Leuten die transpositiv eingestellt sind. Kein Risiko eingehen und lieber ein paar Stunden fahrt und dann ist man aber in guten Händen. Da muss man am Anfang 4 Mal im Jahr hin, später 2 und dann 1 mal im Jahr das geht klar
und ich häng das hiernochmal als Kommentar hintendran, wie erkenne ich ob Endo/Arzt gut oder schlecht ist für mich als Trans Person ohne mich medizinisch auskennen zu müssen:

Green Flags:

* Sie gendern dich korrekt, oder bemühen sich zumindest darum, benutzen deinen chosen Name selbst wenn deine Dokumente noch nicht geändert sind.
* Sie gehen auf deine Bedürfnisse ein. Das bedeutet wenn du Kommentare zb zu deiner Hormondosis hast werden diese ernst genommen anstatt dass man einfach abgefertigt wird. Im Zweifelsfall kannst du immer Hormonwerte auf Reddit posten und schauen, der Hivemind hier hat mehr Ahnung und deckt auf wenn dein Endo dir nicht die richtige Dosis verschreibt
* Termine drehen sich um dein Anliegen nicht um deine Identität, das bedeutet ein Besuch beim Endo sieht zb so aus: Kurze Besprechung, Ziele festlegen bzw schauen wie man sich grade fühlt -> Blutabnehmen -> Nächster Termin machen und tschüss. 20 Minuten maximal

Wenn da in der Mitte ein Verhör eingebaut wird ob du dir auch wirklich ""sicher"" bist oder fragen als wärst du vor Gericht, dann sind wir bei den Red Flags

Red Flags:

* Invasive Fragen. Dazu gehören Fragen zu deiner Sexualität,  sexuelle Praktiken, Sexuelle Vergangenheit, deine Identität, deine Kindheit, Trauma etc. Größte Red Flag von allen.
* Gatekeeping, also das verlangen von überflüssigen ""Beweisen"", Indikation ist zumindest bei der HRT das absolute Maximum, wenn Worte wie ""Alltagstest"" oder dergleichen kommen sofort gehen. Und uns anderen Bescheid sagen
>Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Meinst du Ich sollte es dann in RLP versuchen oder eher jemand hier Empfohlenen aufsuchen?

Vielleicht kommt ja das 49€ Monatsticket, dann wäre die Fahrt zwar immernoch nervig aber wenigstens nicht mehr allzu teuer."	xc8ecz	trans	492	0.95	2022-09-12 09:39:16
I’m a transmasc who prefers fem clothing	"Edit: Woah I wasn’t expecting this to blow up :o
Thank you so much everyone! Everyone’s been so nice and supportive, and it’s so cool hearing about other people who relate! 

bit of a vent? But I need to get these feelings out somewhere

Okok, so I’m a transmasc demiboy. (I’m 16) while I don’t identify as a girl, and do experience dysphoria- weirdly feminine clothing does not make me dysphoric? In fact they make me really happy, and makes me feel confident. Imo guys clothing is really boring 

I know I’m valid, however people have invalidated my gender identity. It also sucks having to constantly explain myself to people- usually the older generation. However I do understand that usually it’s not out of malice, and they just don’t understand. So I’m happy to help educate people 

I used to wear fem clothing when I identified as non-binary, however people only saw me as a girl because of it, and that made me feel really dysphoric. So I decided it wasn’t worth it

However once I’m deep into T, and have a deeper voice/facial hair- and pass more as a dude, I think I’m gonna wear fem clothing again. With a pronoun pin ofc, to let people know I’m a dude 

I just wish clothing wasn’t gendered. imo clothing doesn’t have gender, but unfortunately the majority doesn’t see it this way.

Anyway, sorry for the longish post. Just needed to get these thoughts down somewhere"	"Assigning clothes to gender is fucking stupid to begin with. Lemme wear a dress mom
Feminine transmascs are valid and I will kick anyone who says otherwise. What clothes we like don't invalidate our genders. I don't wear makeup and that doesn't make me any less of a woman.
I am trans masc and I can love wearing feminine things! 
I sew and I’m going into fashion school and I still say that wearing a ball gown is a pure form of joy no matter your gender!
HELL YEAH BROTHER!
Fair enough man. I want to get like a variety of jackets and shirts that have my pronouns in big letters on the front and back because I'm being forced to go boy mode rn and won't be able to even start HRT until I'm away from my parents so I want something to make it very clear from a distance I'm not a man when I get the chance to start being myself even though when I do I won't pass yet
[removed]
I'm a transmasc femboy lol there's no problem with liking ""fem"" clothes they are only clothes there's no need to gender them. Have fun !
Yh, people are just jealous that fem clothes are the best clothes
We definitely exist man. And we have so many things against us. I’ve been struggling with this a lot recently
You don't owe anyone masculinity, I am also a transmasc person who mostly wears ""male"" clothes because I do find it exhausting to explain and I do lack the confidence to wear more fem clothes. But your boy just wants to wear cute skirts with a cute crop top and masc cloths doesn't offer that. Keep being you. Dress how you like! You should not have to sacrifice your comfort for other people's ignorance. Keep slaying ✨️
Presentation is not gender.

A man in a dress *is still a man*. Trans men are men. Trans men in dresses are still men.

Good on you for presenting in a way that pleases you! My trans son has reached the point where he’s decided he likes wearing skirts and dresses from time to time, and his comment was “I’m not rethinking my gender, I’m just rethinking my sense of style”
Fellow transmasc demiboy here! Yeah, fem clothes are awesome, and I have similar anxieties about getting misgendered. One thing I'm trying to tell myself is that whatever I wear is manly by default because I am a man. And since I'm not fully binary anyway, does it really matter? (It does, I know, but I hope this helps.)
I feel this 100%. The more I pass as a man, the more I want to explore my fem side. Gender is dumb, people should be able to wear whatever they want.
Trans guy here. I feel kinda similarly toward clothing. Masc clothing makes me very euphoric, but fem clothing can make me super confident too since I know I’m hot af. I’m leaning more toward masc clothes until I can get on T but think I’ll be more comfy going back to dressing a little more femininely once I’m more through my transition. Not only are you valid but you’re not alone either. Glad you have somewhere to get these thoughts down. Keep being you
honestly feminine clothing has way more choices and styles than masculine clothing and almost always looks good

but im biased bc i wanna be a girl
I feel pretty much the exact same I miss wearing fem clothing but the knowledge that I would never be seen as what I feel inside when wearing those clothes makes me really dysphoric too, I feel seen and understood ;w;
Trans-man here, I feel this so much. I wish I were bigger framed and more visibly masculine so I could were makeup and cutesy things without it guaranteeing that I would be IDed as female
Hey! I’m in the same boat as you. I like dressing fem, but it automatically pins a gender to me that I don’t like. The clothes don’t make me dysphoric, but the perception everyone has of me in them does. I’m also transmasc, but non-binary, basically a they/them femboy. I’m pre-T, so everything about my body is female. I hate it. I’m also 30, and a parent, which really doesn’t help because I’m instantly labeled as “mom”. I’m not. To my son, I’m Maddy.

Inanimate objects being gendered is so dumb.
This makes me so happy to read cause I struggle with the exact same thing I’m agender nb afab and the amount of times I have to argue with my family that wearing a dress is not a gendered thing makes me so tired they get in my head sometimes. Also how easily I get misgendered when I DO wear a dress esp cause I have a long mullet rn and it’s the first time I don’t have a buzz cut or short short hair so it’s like just a big fat real life lesson on how gender perception is so exhausting
>Imo guys clothing are really boring

Truth. as a transfemme, I can confirm guy clothes are boring AF
Im 26, and pre T. But same. But some random person on tiktik said something that I related to alot. They said : I'm masculine in the way a poptart is a ravioli. I like that. I like masc and fem alt clothes, with makeup. But I'm not a she/her person. Im they/he.(starting to lean to Trans man but I'm not in a situation where I can live openly or transition.)
Fair enough! You should check out r/ftmfemininity
Clothes are literally pieces of fabric, what defines your gender is yourself <3
I'm trans aswell fem clothes do make me uncomfortable but I think it as a femboy although I am a femboy although clothes are clothes I wish my family understood that I wanna be a boy
Also a fellow femme trans masc! I still on the occasion wear dresses and makeup but have told everyone around me that I’m doing drag or to think about it in a  make rock start wearing a dress way. It really helped it click for a lot of people around me! 
Mens fashion can be very boring, but alternative mens fashion is fun! I’m a punk rocker so it’s still easy for me to dress cool in a masculine way.
Top surgery is my most exciting part, I can wear dresses, low cut tops and blouses again! So sick of high neck and flavourless boy clothes. I love colour and patterns and pretty material and I'm so glad you have a strong understanding of how that doesn't affect identity.
I'm also a transmasc Demi-boy and even though I prefer men's clothes women's clothes are good too sometimes! 

You be your fem safe fam!

🖤🤍💙🤍🖤
See I’m transmasc they/he but I mostly wear fem clothes. I say my gender is goth because I’m a goth and whenever I’m fully dressed up is when I feel the most euphoric. I attribute it to the fact that even the men of goth dress femininely/androgenously and are still men. Genders weird. But ur fine,dude
I understand your frustration. It's idiotic how pieces of fabric we use to cover ourselves is gendered - You should be free to wear whatever you wish.
My Mom does daycare I overheard one day there was something involving a tutu on TV I think and one of the boys she babysits asked what it was and when she explained it's for ballet (in her very conservative view of ballet) he said ""I wanna do that"" and she immediately said ""you're a boy"" and it pissed me off but since I'm financially dependent on her rn and I am an adult (it's fucking hard to move without a car) I couldn't say anything because idk if she'll kick me out or what if she realizes I'm not the cishet conservative Christian boy she thinks I am
Exactlyyyy dresses are so pretty! :o
66YO cis woman and men tee shirts are for me so I  don't get gendering clothes either.
Yeah, I might do the same with putting my pronouns on a jacket. But I wish you the best with getting away from your parents, and starting hrt :]
It soooo is. Clothes are literally just pieces of fabric?? Like?
Yeah exactly!
Fr fr
Also, I recommend checking out r/FTMfemininity. It definitely helps my confidence a bit; if they can do it, I can, too! :)

How do I rock fem clothing with no chest?	"Heya! So I’m Dylan, I’m actually an enby but I’m super feminine. Recently I finally figured out what I am in most woman’s sizing for bottoms and it’s been amazing, however it’s really hard to pair a baggy mens T-shirt with a skirt and while shopping for Tops I realized “oh yeah I don’t have a chest lol” any tips on that and maybe bras?

Edit
Hey everyone thank you so much for the feedback!! This was amazingly helpful, y’all are simply wonderful ☺️ I think I know what to do now!"	"Hey Dylan! Have you ever seen a fashion show? None of those woman have a chest bigger than A cups. you don’t need a bra or boobs to rock fem clothes ^^ i would suggest you try a crop top first
Not all women's clothes are cut for bigger chests. You can definitely wear a whole bunch of styles with a flat chest. I'd just recommend trying on lots.of different styles to see what suits you the most and what you feel best in.
The answer depends on how particular you are about the bra and fake boobs. There are a lot of different ways to achieve this. Each with their own pros and cons. 

Best answer is to google for crossdressing tips on fake boobs. There are a bunch of great articles that answer this very well. Some in great detail. 

Pre transition I experimented with fake boobs a lot of different ways. The two ways I favored were:

Option 1: “Sports bra” and a “silicone bra insert.”

Option 2: A “full coverage bra” and a “triangle silicone breast form.”

Note: I quoted them so you know exactly what to search for. 

If you really really want cleavage:

Option 3: get 3 “Nu-Bra” . One in each cup size: A, B, C. 

The magic here is that a Nu-Bra (or generic equivalent) is about half an inch (~1 cm) thick, and shaped like a breast. So if you wear three at once, you make your chest look that much bigger. 

You wear all three stacked. You put on the A cup first. Then B, and finally C.
A lot of womens clothes fit just fine without a chest. Though if you’re experiencing dysphoria due to having a flat chest, I recommend getting a push-up bra and filling it out with clean socks. Lay them flat, and try your best to smooth out any bumps.
Crop tops really give you the illusion of chest action from my experience!
Building some glorious pecs is a possible option
For some outfits an empty padded bra works for me. With others I have some silicon inserts that I put in the bra, I do this with the other outfits too if I want my chest to look a bit bigger than the bra on its own.
Just find shirts that are fitted for less chest… juniors clothing tends to have less room in the chest and works well :-)

I’m 42 and mostly buy juniors tops because they are fitted and accentuate the minimal curves I have
Twiggy model from my childhood was flat chested. I went from none to d cups and cried for days. Some of her looks come back around from time to time.
Most any crop tops( you can just cut up your baggy mens tshirts) and if your shopping for a new top, go for some sort of v-neck. It gives the illusion of cleavage…. It sounds weird I know. Just trust me.
Accessorise ;]
I'm not huge, 38b now but when I was more androgynous I found plenty of tops to wear. 

Overall I find women's clothing has to be tried on. Often I'll see something and it's in my size, but put it on and just no, does not look good on me. 

See something you like go try it on! You'll be surprised at what works and it's fun when you find something cute on you.
Everyone looks awsome as a punk. I may be biased
Idk where these stores are, but Francesca’s has some cute smaller tops, very femme style too and I’ve found they work well with smaller chests (for example I wear a binder lol and was able to wear the tops no problem)
I'm a cis woman and i have a flat chest, don't worry you don't need one to rock fem outfits!
My flat-chested femme partner has a whole drawer full of WAY cute little cammis and braletts that would look ridiculous on my big ol boobaloobies. Learning to dress for your body type takes some time!! You got this :)
You dont need a chest for most fem outfits.
A nice place to find swishy dresses is old navy or any thrift store
I’d also recommend if you want a visible chest, breast forms are the best investment I’ve ever made. I absolutely LOVE them
For bras, I'd wear a sports bra until you get top surgery or big enough breasts. That's what I'm doing
shirts with shape cut outs look especially good on flat chests, i think
(like a shirt with a heart cut out in the middle of the chest)
I just wore a bra and was honestly surprised at how realistic it looked
Emphasize your legs! :)
[removed]
Omg I’m a Dylan too !!
Chest or not. You got a heart in there. Follow it.
check out clara dao. you can rock anything with flat chest :)
i'm ftm but! i find either tight shirts or baggy long-sleeve crops to be fun to imagine if i had a flat chest (i have a fem style even tho im transmasc)
You know I’ve never actually seen a fashion show, I’m rather new to actually expressing my style, I’ll give crop tops a shot!
Padded sports bras worked pretty good with my pre-hrt moobs.gives a little volume to the chest without overdoing it
Good to know I’ll be looking into this tomorrow
because corporate dose not care if it is for them lol

Ikr? She looks great! Ya know, I've wondered what the deciding factor is when it comes to results. At first I thought it would be age (which matters - to an extent - until puberty passes us by). I'm thirty and thought I was going to be disappointed - but it's two months and my butts rounding out, my skin has turned silky, and something is different about the way I physically feel things.

This is torture	"I recently (2 weeks ago) found out I’m trans (mtf) and it feels like I’m stagnant. 

I can’t voice train since my conservative family will get suspicious, I can’t buy feminine clothes or earrings because I don’t have a job (in my country I can only get legally paid for my work at 16 and I’m 15), I can’t even start hrt because of needing a therapist letter and my parents don’t believe in therapy.

It feels like the only things I can do is change my pronouns and distract myself, it doesn’t even help that my parent deadname me with a name I’ve denied and expressed hate for for a decade. 

I’m going away to college next year where I’ll be able to transition but it’s frustrating, torturous even to live in a body that doesn’t feel like mine until then"	"That sucks! I wish I could help...

Only one more year, you can do it girl!

You are a strong, fabulous, beautiful lady!

We believe in you <3
Are you literally me? I feel exactly how you do, but unfortunately I went to online college, so I couldn't leave. And now with this housing market? It's gonna be tough to even leave.


But, as a gal who has had the same exact experience, I wanna tell you that small little things are the way to go, for now. For example, I don't know if you do, but I changed my online gamertag over to Maxine on everything, so whenever people talk to me in text chat, I've been getting used to it. Try developing your identity in a safe and open place. 


If you ever do need anything too, do not hesitate to reach out on this sub. My DMs are also open, if you ever need anything. I believe in you 💜
I'm FTM, exact same boat except it's been 4 weeks now. You're not alone honey.
The waiting is one of the hardest parts about being trans. Waiting to be able to come out and live as yourself is really fucking hard. For me, a few things helped in the time between coming out to myself and coming out to everyone else. For one thing I was able to come out to my friends, which was safe since I was in college, but even when you’re at home if you have online friends you can ask them to use your name and pronouns! Keeping a diary and writing down your feelings can be great temporary relief, because it feels like your feelings are out on the page instead of in your head, though make sure you do this safely and it can’t get discovered by your family. I also used fiction to help myself. I like writing and drawing, and writing and drawing about trans men (I’m FTM) helped me imagine how my life could be, and affirm my feelings by creating characters like me. Another way you can do this is by playing video games with female protagonists or by making female avatars. I hope that some of these ideas are helpful to you!
Being denied your true self can be devastating to some. I know it won’t help much but you might try meditation and small things should help. 
By the time you start college you’ll be better prepared and will be more at peace with yourself than now. That’s something to look forward to.
AWW IM SO SORRY!! 😢 I WISH YOU ALL THE BEST LUCK!😖💖🥺 THIS IS REALLY HEARTBREAKING! BUT AT LEAST YOU'LL BE ABLE TO BE YOU PRETTY SOON 😖😭💖💖
I feel you I have known that im trans since I was about your age and today at almost my 20s I have done little to nothing in regards to my transition, all i can tell is that it takes time and patience, there will be times when you feel you are not going anywhrre but trust me, it will happen eventually if you just hold on to that goal. dont lose hope.
It sucks and it’s awful but we will be here to help you get through it. It’s just one year you can make it and then start to physically transition. You’re a strong girl you got this
It's pretty much the same for me. Though you can try nail polish, shaving or growing your hair out. My first step would be identifying as a girl on social media.
Hope your journey goes well!
I know the feeling, i have to go through a very slow transition because my brother doesn't accept me.

You are a strong and beautiful woman, you can make it through this, the wait will be worth it.
I’ve been waiting for almost a year now, and it’s looking like it’ll be another year before I can start hormones. All I can tell you is to hold out. 

Everything sucks right now, and it’s going to feel like you’re wasting time. Like your chance at transitioning is passing you by, but it’s not. 

All of this will pass and soon you’ll be in the clear, with no one to hold you back. I promise it will all be worth it.
I’m in the exact same spot and I agree, it’s a nightmare
I know it’s not as gender affirming as HRT or dressing how you would like but if you should ever need someone to talk to, I’m here, just message me! I don’t mind trying out new pronouns/new names to help you get a feel for what’s comfortable and maybe talk through some of the things you were going through since I’ve been in the same boat!💖✨
You can definitely voice train in secret and choose when to and not to feminize your voice. ❤️
look into DIY? youre kind of at an early enough stage concerning puberty. could avoid having all the bodyhair (damn i hate shaving...)
Omg same for me, with my hardcore transphobic dad :(
At the very least, Dungeons and Dragons is a perfectly acceptable, albeit nerdy, way to justify voice training.
I’m sorry that you are struggling with this stage of your life, knowing that you can’t take your positive steps towards your future. At your age I was going through suppression and denial, which led into depression and suicidal thoughts.

Don’t focus on the present, focus on your future! Make a plan, and take each step that you can, when you can.

Just remember that you are still young, you have plenty of time to become your true self. Starting before 18 is still better than starting in your 20’s or 30’s.
You seem to be in a rush,you found out very recently and you want everything to change NOW. 
You should take it easy it is a long process and it should be, its a huge decision to make.
Congratulations on coming out!! 💖

I wish you the absolute best in your journey 💖


If you are open to a couple suggestions 

You could disguise your voice training with singing to higher pitched songs if you have the chance to play them out loud around anyone if needed or when you are alone you have an easy “excuse” for talking like that.

There also some quieter stretches you could look into if the dysphoria starts to feel bad. It may seem slow at first, but you are building up your ideal voice strength. 

If you feel like painting your nails black you may get a little less grief? I was still teased, but I did dress in full goth attire/makeup for a time.
That really sucks : ( I know how you feel, I know it's hard to believe but it won't last forever. You will transition and become the woman you want to become!

The best thing you can do rn is do what's best for you and keep yourself safe. 

You will get through this, take it one thing at a time, it will get better and remember, you're already a woman!
Meh, I say you should voice train anyways. Maybe say your looking for a career in voice acting and these exercises help you expand your range. Or maybe just tell them that your thinking of changing your voice with out to much detail. You can also diet and exercise. Maybe diet not so much, but there are feminizing leg  exercises for narrowing your waist and growing out your hips.  I know it’s hard being in a position where it feels like you cannot be you ( believe me, I’m in a similar situation) I just want to say maybe do hrt as a last thing of your transition and focus these skills first. 

I’m unsure about hrt at a young age. I don’t know a lot, and I think there is a fine line between support and grooming, so read on and ignore what I say if it aggravates you okay?

on the subject of hrt I’m gonna say listen to the people who are gonna tell you what you don’t want to hear when it comes to hrt. I’m not telling you not too do it, but the folks that oppose you, try to get as much of their perspective as possible on the matter. If philosophy has taught me anything it’s people like THEM that truly are the only people you are going to encounter with advice you need to consider. The take away is anyone can tell you what you want to hear with little facts, it’s the people that oppose you that have concerns, worries, doubts, questions. It might be repetitive, it might be frustrating, but those are the challenges you have to overcome to decide if it’s really what you want. Good luck, stay positive, keep an open mind.
i understand how you feel and i'm going through the same thing. all you can really do is hang on until you have the resources you're able to get. i know it hurts a lot to be forced into a position you don't want to be, but the time will be here before you know it. you just have to be hopeful for the future. i'm sorry that you have to go through what you're going through because no one deserves this. ♥️
[deleted]
I'm also experiencing something like that as my parents refuse to believe what my therapist told them.
The only advice I can give is try to find (if you don't already have) a supportive friend and ask them to maybe hide some feminine kinda clothing at their place and whenever you hang out you'll be able to feel more comfortable.
Also you can try and introduce yourself to a few people that you'll never met again (ex: you order a coffee an ask the worker to put your name/name you're comfortable with on the cup), that works as a great confidence boost even if it's just temporary.
Of course, even it worked for me (ftm) it might not work for you.
I know it feels torturing but you have to remember that you are fighting for this and one day you'll be able to be happy, future feels really far but one day you'll look back and be proud of yourself because you kept believing.

I hope this made you feel better and remember that you are and will always be valid.
I'm proud of you :D
You just made my day, thanks
Thanks for the advice, I’ll take it to heart. Stay strong 💙💜🤍💜💙 ❤️💜💙
I’m an artist and writer, I’ll take that advice and hopefully it’ll help me get through the waiting
I’ll be looking forward to it and what type of meditation do you recommend
But it feels like I can’t when 1 day feels like an eternity
Thanks, I’ll try to endure through this
Namibia
thank you, for being such a cool person
Only if you promise to stay strong too 🏳️‍⚧️
I’m not a specialist but meditation has worked on a friend of mine when she had to wait to start other therapy. It’s not what’s on the outside that’s important, but our inside self. Focus on that in any way you can.
I get it. I have friends in similar situations, trapped at home having to put transitioning on hold. And it sucks, it hurts and that’s ok to acknowledge. 

Hang out with people who know the true you, call you by your chosen name, and do whatever affirming things you can and keep your eye on the prize. Transitioning, HRT, having a body you can be happy in, you will get there. This struggle and pain will end you just have to endure till you get out of that house you’re in
🫂
Ok thanks
I’m sorry you find yourself in this obviously frustrating period and hope you can get past it soon."	vlv570	trans	477	0.98	2022-06-27 13:08:55
Pre-everything MtF | Life has been crazy recently with starting therapy for the first time, and switching jobs. On the plus side though, my new clothes all came in.		"You look so awesome!! And the top in the first pic is so cute 😭❤
Damn girl, those abs. How you get abs like that?! I’m jelly.

Probably lots of hard work and exercise lol.
Ooooooo I'm liking the outfits!
You look so wonderful
Is it just me, or do all the long haired brunettes on here look incredibly similar???

Also, you're pretty :3
You look seriously cute! I bet HRT will make you even cuter 🥰
Youre rockin that first top, girlie!😍hope your new job is going well!

HRT is gonna do you wonders☺️
Girl, I thought those outfits were cute as I scrolled through, but then I hit the last one and my eyes were like 0.0 “**cute**”
Is it legal to be this cute !!?
When I saw this, I thought you were a cis woman on r/progresspics showing off her newly gained abs. Then I went to comment and noticed the sub.

Needless to say, you pass very well, your hair is fantastic, and girl those abs. I am obsessed.

Also now I want to work out.
You're so cute, those outfits look amazing on you😻😻
I really like your style and you look great in it all.
You look so pretty, the outfit in the second pic, looks so magnificent on you. 👌❤️😘 Everything looks beautiful but the second pic is my personal fave. 😍❤️
Look good girl
It looks like your posing for your passport photo lol. Love the look tho haha
Them. Beautiful. Abs.
Wonderful abs
I wish I could tell you I'm determined and persistent. But the truth is I just dont get to eat enough and I'm semi-active. But most of my life is spent sitting at the computer. Honestly though, if I can do it I believe anybody can.
Thank you! <3
My hair just kind of landed on my shoulders that way. I've been considering going shoulder-length again but I love having super long hair! Everyone is always complimenting it
You're too kind! Daaamn going trans has boosted my confidence more than anything in my life. Lol
Thank you!!! The abs were such an unintended effect from these pictures but I noticed them while posting. I feel like I dont deserve them with little to no effort! Makes me feel guilty :P
Thank you! I just kinda bought what was cute!

On a side note, SheIn has become an addiction
I definitely need to get the confidence (and makeup) to go out in public :o

Thank you so much!
Lmao! I just barely started taking pictures of myself after going trans. I also feel like I dont know how to use my own face because I had given up on so much expression for the longest time. Trying to figure out how to smile, or look cute, without looking like a damn goofball
Thank you! You guys are amazing :'D
I vow to eat less and become semi-active 😎
Of course I hope you're having a great day
You are so right that the hair looks so nice! It’s your hair and you’re the one that has to struggle with it, but I’d leave it.
I hope everything is going great for you in life rn! You deserve it!
You're an amazing woman I appreciate you a lot"	jrjpew	trans	450	0.99	2020-11-10 11:56:05
IVE MADE IT GUYS IM A REAL GUY	Holy shit I just realized that I pass so well the other cis men just assume I’m a guy and I’m not even on T. 10 This one really homophobic teacher just thinks I’m a guy and says blatantly transphobic things in front of me, and it’s so funny cause he doesn’t even realize he’s talking to a trans guy right now. My voice is low, well low enough to pass because of some voice training videos I’ve been doing on the internet. My chest is also really flat and I just wear very loose clothes or hoodies. Finally I’ve made it. After the tear soaked pillowcases, the threats, the slurs, everything I’ve finally pulled through. And it’s so fucking worth it. (Just needed to get this out somewhere thanks <3)	"[deleted]
Well done boyo you're valid
It’s awesome you pass. Sorry the validation is coming from bigots
Dude--nice!
Now you need to start making other men transphobes feel small and weak when they’re transphobic, thats the way to get a message across to men lol, break through the ego and then strike

"""These aren't women's clothes. These are my clothes. I bought them."""		"But if you’re a woman, then they are woman’s clothes
I’m still in that awkward stage of “I just came out and I’m terrified to buy women’s clothing cause *judgement*”, but once I finally do buy some I am definitely gonna pull this line
Good taste. I like your hair too.
Eddie Izzard! Love it the quote! (And the outfit too)
I’ll pull that line if I get any feminine clothes before I come out.
You are a woman so are they are womans clothes... not sure how they are not seeing this...
I'm a woman so I'm technically in the right boat wearing dresses and stuff, but some people I'm not out to- mainly transphobes- don't know that.

Someone told me it was weird. I said I wear clothes because I like their color and style.

""Wait, do you mean to tell me you pick your clothes based on your genitals?"" I asked. ""Now *that* seems kind of weird...""

He looked at me like I was the weird one.
Nice!
A very good buy!
All of my clothes are women's clothes, because they are my clothes and I an a woman.
I was just looking at a similar skirt the other day!
1) Yeah, it's a Snapchat filter. I don't own any makeup yet and I'm not on HRT, so it's the best I can do for now. 😔

2) I still identify as a man, so the quote does apply to me. I'm still at the beginning of my journey. ✈️

3) This is the first time I picked out a whole cute outfit by myself. 🥰

4) This is the first time anyone in the world besides my supportive wife has seen me wearing women's clothes, so it felt like a big step. 💪🏼
Perhaps they dont identify as a woman
Just do it. I was terrified the first time but you quickly find out that no one cares. This is also the perfect time of year, people are Christmas shopping, sales are good, and people are so crazed that no one will pay attention to you at all.
That’s a Snapchat filter
Thanks!
I'm a man, actually. At least for now.
I love that line. It's so true!
Got my inspiration from @kaylaautumnward on Instagram!
Correct. I'm still a man in everyday life for now.
That’s a good point... I might have to go back out shopping after all
Yep. Not trying to fool anyone except my subconscious. 😋
I put a skirt in an online shopping cart two months ago (I have others, I just liked the look of this one). I couldn't afford it at full price. I watched as it went in and out of stock, and as sales got better and better. Finally, yesterday, it went on final markdown price, $19.88. A huge bargain. But the store also had another 40% off. Down to $11.93! 

""Too bad shipping isn't free"", I lamented to my mother. She said, ""Is there anything else on sale? The price of shipping won't change."" So I looked and found another one I liked for the same price. Got two skirts, in a tall size no less, for about $30. I'm wearing one of them to court for my name change hearing in January, which is also the day I start my new job. 

I hope your shopping trip goes well!
It is absolutely fine! I’m in the military and just got approval to be able to grow my hair out... i Used the filter to help see myself with longer hair without buying a wig early in my transition. You do look stunning with your fashion choices though, I’m just very direct lol.
Thats an amazing deal, and thank you! I hope to get a name change one of these days as well."	ecrvrf	trans	450	0.98	2019-12-19 11:19:48
Sports bra's are cool! even in guys clothes 🥰		"i almost exclusively wear sports bras. theyre just nice.
Cutie
Frankly the day I realised I needed something to help due to sensitivity was a happy day. Padding and sport bras are my favourite thing. I find Victoria secrets barg8n buckets that pop-up every now and then has some good firing large sport bras for real cheap.
true
They are like the only bras I own. Definitely comfy.
Love the nails! 🏳️‍⚧️

Yes u fit it amazing
The only problem is that it's really tight on the thorax (there weren't many very large ones at the store to account for the trans thorax experience™) but for now it's great
thank you 😊🏳️‍⚧️!
nice
Heck yeah (though the other part of it is that wearing a shirt with no bra at all feels really uncomfy with the breasts I do have being partially exposed😣)"	10pw0y1	trans	438	0.99	2023-01-31 10:49:14

i love ur outfit!  youre killing it queen!
This is honestly the part that gives me the most amount of anxiety/butterflies is getting a new wardrobe. 

You look gorgeous btw
K you are adorable!!!!
Oh my goodness, I especially love the first photo!  What a great look!
Thank you! And sorry my mom got them for me i dont know where she got them from
Thank you!!

Thanks! It is its just a bit itchy
I got the same pants from hot topic.
well more people should call others queen or king and not mess up names
And your very welcome I’ll definitely be looking for similar things to nuy next time I go cloth shopping
Ok first thing you need to do to take off the cloths is grab cloths either pull them up or down then pull them in the opposite directions from your body depending on the limb is on... I feel like I could have done that better but it’s Reddit you get what you ask for lmao

Any other Tomboys in this sub qwq?	"As above 😅. I sometimes feel like an outcast when talking to other trans girls in my city as it seems that i'm the only one who has a more masculine style which makes me kind of feel left out at points because it seems that they don't validate me as much because i'm not feminine enough which in my opinion is complete bs. I think you can dress however you want trans femboys and tomboys are as valid as anyone else. Your clothing doesn't define gender and i feel like some peeps forget that sometimes. Just needed to vent a little i guess.
Hope everyones having an amazing day/night regardless 😇



Edit: 
Jesus i never expected this post to gain that much traction and i just wanted to thank all of you. Reading the replies made me smile and the day so much better for me. 
And i just wanted to say i love this community so much and thank you all for making my day brighter 🥰"	"Hell yeah we have tomboys 😎😎😎 (i am one of them)
Eh, you’re definitely not alone. It’s only about the gender that you feel comfortable in, not the clothes you wanna wear. In the end, it’s just cotton and polyester and in your case you’re a girl just rocking another outfit!

Embrace who you are! 😊
Yeah I think I'm a chapstick butch trans woman. I don't like makeup and I feel exposed when wearing a skirt (which isn't always bad). Which is a little scary tbh because I worry about being seen as faking being trans because of it.
Since I skateboard I wear a lot of really masc shoes and super baggy cargo pants, but I usually try to feminize from the waist up :) I see the appeal of a more masc style, since skating in my leggings or skirts isn't really the best play haha
I'm super fem but i do like to play sports
r/MTFbutch
I’ve lived in hiding for so long that I definitely have many masculine traits and even enjoy them. Im a gun and sword nerd and love martial arts and outdoorsy stuff. I’ll definitely rock dresses and hiking boots lmao.  Im just me, so im gonna do whatever i want. Heck my sister is the most masculine person ive ever met, and she doesn’t feel like she was meant to be born a man at all shes just mega masculine and dominant like with her boyfriend. Shes an Alpha for sure lol. I still wonder how she got so tall and strong.
Tomboy and femboy in one🥰
I'm a biker. Like motorcycle biker. I wear lots of motorcycle stuff.

I'm not a very femme dressing person.
I like to think of myself as a tomboy but I'm unsure if I can have that title 😅
I’m with ya there! I love the alt butch kinda vibe but it does feel tough sometimes cause it’s not as feminine. But my approach is whatever makes me feel good and comfortable is what matters, not what others think:)
An unachievable goal of mine is to be able to wear masc clothing and still look feminine. I'm so envious of girls who can do this.
yes another one here, i am mostly a tomboy and enjoy it fits best with what i feel about my gender.
i always loved the tomboy look, i always feel weird in it cause of internalized stuff, but boy in a girl way is way different to boy in a boy way
Hola ☺️
yes ! :)
Tomboys represent!
Both me and my sister are Tom boys.

It's ok to like sports or guns.

She even took Karate and played 3 sports at the same time in highschool.
Trans tomboy here, reporting for duty! 

""There are *dozens* of us!"" 

Seriously, though, it's nice to find this post. I wish we were more accepted.
I don't see it as a binary 'tomboy or not' I've got feminine traits, I've got traits not seen as traditionally feminine. I'm just me, I'm f*cking brilliant.
My ultimate goal is tomboy.
Yo! Butch lesbian working construction here! Lol
Me!
Trans tomboy here! Wear the ball cap, climb the tree, work on the engine, be trans, do crime!! 😝🏳️‍⚧️
I feel more comfortable with male mannerisms than female a lot of the time. I do dress super masc but that's because I still look like a man so it would be kinda weird, but even then I'm more excited to wear casual clothes that aren't super girly. 

I just find girly stuff is often too much work and the male coded stuff isn't. 

Have you ever realized that it's common for men to get comfortable wherever they are? Leaning against things, sitting on things, etc. But women don't, and I think that's just the super deep gender norms that are etched into every fiber of our beings the second we enter society.

But fuck that, I like feeling comfortable and being more boyish usually let's me do that.
I go between tomboy and femme but do a lot of martial arts and love showing off my muscles if dat counts lol
I am a tom boy who occasionally dabbles in hardcore goth girl attire outside the more masculine styles. But yeah, I'm 100% with you.
It is basic logic that clothes doesn't have a gender.

hell yeah, and i work on cars practically every day 😅 fuck gender norms and stereotypes 😤🤙
Yep, I find it fun to be both TBH. Depends on my mood lol.
I think if i ever find the courage transition ill be a tomboy :) but for now im just femboy ish person that loves dressing as feminine as possible
I came to the same conclusion. I like my long hair. I like looking cute. But dresses arent my style. I can still feel feminine as a tomboy. Don't listen to other people. You are enough exactly as you are.
I grew up in Wyoming, when I start my journey I already know I'll be tomboyish
Trans tomboy reportin in
As a trans gal who is more kinda an average woman, yes you are still 100% valid!!! You don't have to be super femme to be transfem!!
Some times I wanna be a tomboy but my inner diva is always like ""hell no b**ch"" 😂 and the dysphoria hits like a train, just not a good feeling for me. Plus tomboys have guy friends and my relationship with men is always awkward if it stays on a ""friendly  basis""
Definitely more of a tomboy :)
Sometimes I want to dress more masculine/androgynous  but I usually don't cuz of dysphoria
Ditto on the hell yeah 😎
😊
> I worry about being seen as faking being trans because of it

This is kind of ironic because I worry about being seen as faking by going hyperfem
Not even a little fake! 100% woman!

I wish i had a motorcycle aaa my dream
Oh I wanna see your bike now!
Yess and i rlly apreciate all the replies ya'll made my day much better  <3
Def will check out thanks for the recomendation :3
Yes yess i love all the positivity in the replies 😊
Omg yes i saw your post earlier you look stunning <3
Also rlly jelly of your hair want it to be the same but mines too straight/curly cause my hair can't decide what it wants xD
Hello tomboys i'm Mom
Honestly same but more masc styles most of the time
Same with me too i knew from the begining
Now THAT'S more like it 😤

Try not to let those things ruin your vibe *too* much, aight? Keep being your most you-est you!!
We just can't win lol
You can get one. They are way cheaper than cars. 

A brand new Honda Shadow costs under 8K.

My hair is getting more curly on HRT !
:o
We all have imposter syndrome :D luckily we have each other for validation 🥰
I think this highlights a sad part of the modern world. Clothes exists for every possible gender, even hyperfem and tomboy and STILL we can't win. It's always a ""too much this"" ""too much that"". It's a struggle many men and women (both cis and trans) goes through.
Yes defo will when i can but for now just planning to get my liscence since i'm still in school and can't earn money yet so ye soon hopefully
Aww that's nice am happy for you :3
I mean if you like it ofc because i know some people don't like to deal with it but i honestly prefer it more than my own straight hair. Also this got me thinking and i think my hair might have gotten more curly since starting hrt too i just never noticed the change cause firstly i thought it was always like that but apparently not cause my mom told me my hair was soo flat a few years back. I honestly don't remember how i looked a few years back
Ye nice twist on the dad jokes 
I'm gonna capitalize on mom jokes now (even tho i'm not that good at them😅)
Quite the power move
Ofc ofc but gotta use the power wisely yk"	wlql4b	trans	411	0.98	2022-08-11 12:48:40
It’s hard being poor and being trans. I know soooo many of us know and deeply feel this. Just needed space to say it today. Buying gender affirming clothes, medicines, toys, surgeries, even good hair cuts. Sigh I just want to be me		"Worst part is that in the UK the NHS gatekeep treatment if you are not presenting as your iddentified gener which can be really hard when you are broke and cant affordd to buy a whole new wardrobe.
While I admit I still transitioned somewhat early in the grand scheme of things (mid-20s) one of the reasons it took that long (my egg broke shortly before college) is because I wanted to have my own money coming in *just in case* my parents reacted poorly to my coming out and/or used the expensive of it all as a reason not to do it. (They didn't and everything was fine.)

If I ever *make it make it*, one of the things I will do is start a charity that helps get transfolk the things they need like you mention. Not exactly sure how it will all work, but I want to help.
I am pre-anything transition, and this is one of my many worries. I work in a low-wage job- I’d like to think I’m smart, but was never able to achieve due to mental illness. I’m not out to my parents yet, so I don’t know what’ll happen with their potential support when I do. I’m lucky that my insurance will cover some gender-affirming care, but not all of it. Especially because I have so much stuff that isn’t strictly medical that I’d like to do. But… I need to do this, and do the best I can. “Oh, so what do you do for fun outside of work?” “Am girl.”
Look into the organization No More Dysphoria! I’ll link it below. It’s my friend’s org, they help fund things like this for trans people who need help.

https://www.nomoredysphoria.org
Preaaaaach! 🙌
Im a homeless trans enby living with my girlfriend who is also trans and right now we live in a hotel and have no car and will probably be homeless in a week if i dont come up with some money quickly :')
Not sure if this can help, but there are good non-profit orgs out there!

http://changeofclothesinc.org/
So much this. I don't even think I'm technically ""poor"" (I live above the poverty line, but in a high cost of living area, and make little enough that I'm still eligible for Medicaid, idk if that is poor or lower middle class, you decide) and it's still just incredibly difficult to be able to afford everything.
origamicustoms.com has options for gender affirming clothes for those that can't afford them, like gaffs and binders. They also support a wide range of body types. This is all why I support them specifically.
I definitely feel this.  I use Plume for my HRT simply because there are not any doctors that will take me seriously where I live in the US.  Not to mention my insurance won't cover a single trans medical procedure so paying an endo out of pocket on top of the therapist is 100% impossible no matter how much i want it.  

As for clothes, hair, etc, I am blessed to have a partner that fully supports my need to transistion and happily agrees with me buying what I need when we can.  That doesn't mean whole new closet full of clothes for the real me, but it does mean over the last 1.5 years I have been very slowly discovering what i like and building my new wardrobe.  

But in the end, regardless of what I feel I need, any surgical options will most likely be off the table until things change in the god awful healthcare industry and my insurance actually starts covering at least a portion of the procedures I really need.
Yep. Transitioning is a luxury most don't have. In every sense of the word.
Look up local buy nothing groups on social media (and don't hesitate to create an ask post), craigslist free sections, get clever with the thrifties and the clothing part gets a little more obtainable. Medicines, toys, surgeries are another pain but a good affirming wardrobe helps a lot.
Total mood for me tbh
It's hard being poor and doing lots of things. But I definitely feel you. And wish you the best.
Even if you’re not poor: FFS surgery is completely unaffordable for most of us :-( I wish health insurance had to pay for that stuff

I found a trimmer at Lidl shortly after I saw these—and later discovered there were hair cutting shears and a cape in the box as well, I’ve been cutting my own hair for almost two years now. (Medium long hair, neck trimmed.)
I'm deep in that struggle as well, and it is so crushing T_T
I know in the US, depending on your therapist, those kind of things are so easy to circumvent. I sought out my first therapist because she had a reputation as an extremely trans-friendly ""box checker"". If you went in and said you were trans and wanted to start HRT, you got it. 

It's probably not good that it's *so easy* in some cases, but it's not hard to bend the rules here.
Thank you!!
You’re welcome! I hope it’s helpful! Truthfully the person that runs it is like a friend of a friend, someone I haven’t talked to in a while so idk if it’s still up and running at full force but either way I’m sure it’ll be helpful to look into. If nothing else you could probably message/send an email asking if they know any other similar organizations.
I hope you can friend.
Please contact The Albert Kennedy trust if you are from the UK and under age 25

Thanks for sharing:)
Totally, the word poor has such a strong connotation that even I felt weird typing it but with the cost of living so high, debt, wages not increasing like yes I make money and I’m not the stereotypical poor but under capitalism I am not thriving and my financial situation is stressful. Financial situation is not good enough to be able to choose the “wants” of my transness over my bills and “needs”
Great idea, thank you💙
Thanks :)
Well the thing is, even the medical world agrees that the absolute best way to know if someone is trans is to ask them, so really it shouldn't need much more than that, maybe just someone else you're out to to confirm so it can't be as easily abused
Sadly i live in the US :')
Okay, then maybe contact your local 211 and ask them about resources for shelter

OH MY GOD	"I just tried on girl clothes for the first time and holy fuck.
I have never EVER Had more euphoria than I do right now."	"Wait until you live in them. Been several months now, and I’m still every bit as delighted when I get to put on a cute outfit!
Ohhhhhh yeaaaaaah
Let's goooo girllll
I get it!  It just feels right.  And in my case, they actually fit, unlike the male clothes I've struggled with my entire life that never fit my odd body shapes.
Congratulations!!!! I'm working on maybe trying something later this month, but I'm scared of my family.
First time I bought and tried on my own girl clothes I took so many photos. I had never ever before enjoyed taking photos/any photos of myself
I’m so happy for you!
Wait till you get on nice panties and a good bra   And a camisole you will enjoy this a lot more the clothes are a lot softer and nicer colours and are more comfortable wearing try leggings on for the house to lounge around in 😘🥰👩🥳
Wooooooooooooooooooo congrats
Welcome to the good life girl!
That’s so wholesome
nice, girl :)
Well, I feel it. Congrats!
It's the start. You'll see amazing garments you must have. They'll call to you in a new way. And they will multiply lol
Yas! It's the best feeling! Happy for you girl<3

So I have my first electrolysis appointment this week and apparently I can't shave for a few days beforehand. I haven't gone a day without shaving since I came out and I'm kind of freaking out, but on the bright side, I found some cute clothes at the thrift store! 🙅🏻‍♀️		"okay but why are you so cute and gorgeous at the same time
It’s gonna suck. That’s the unfortunate truth. On the bright side, things will only get better after your session, and we happen to be in a time where it is not only just accepted, but expected to cover your face in public.
Remember to drink enough water, have a good nights sleep and don’t do anything that will make the skin more sensitive. 

I’ve only done laser hair removal, but it hurts quite a lot and it helps if you have energy and feel well. Good luck 😊!
Okay out of curiosity, how much skin does an electrolysis session cover? Like, can they do like 2 square inches, or 20?
It’s the worst feeling no being able to shave.. it starts feeling itchy and dysphoric but hang in there, it’s worth it ❤️
Hang in there.
Loving the necklace ☺️
You look absolutely amazing complete goals right there!! If I could look half as good I’d be happy! 😍
Also that necklace is it a molecule necklace and if so which is it I’ve been trying to figure it out for the like half an hour just because my stupid brain needed to know which molecule it is
HOW ARE YOU SO PRETTY?
I’ve never met a trans person that doesn’t thrift (yes I do thrift 🖐🥶)
The whole not being able to shave thing sucks; however it does start to get easier as time goes on and the hair is less and less.

Also, you can't shave the affected area for a minute as it needs to heal. You don't want to be shaving off any blister or scab material if you want it to heal quickly.
Prepare for your face to be right fucked up for a while, either swollen and healing or stubbly. It takes about a week to heal the damage, and if you're on a weekly schedule, you get maybe one day a week you can shave if you're lucky.

 It's so worth it in the end, but that end is going to take a while to get to. Make no illusions about how long this is going to take. I'm on month 4 or 5 and my cheeks are starting to thin substantially, but that's as far as we've gotten. 

Good luck, you got this!
Good luck and congrats!
Wonder how that costs for a beard removal... im gonna be looking into that with taxes but im afraid its gonna be way to expensive
Would a symbolic going-away celebration help? I take it the electrolysis will prevent the facial hair from growing back? maybe just think ""goodbye"" every time you notice the hair?
Welp... Just like that you made me blush... Thhhhaaaannnnkkkssss 😊

But honestly, thank you so so so so much. Today's been rough and hearing that means a lot 💕
Thank you for your bluntness, I know it's going to suck but I'm so thankful that I have the opportunity to do it. I can't wait for the hair to be gone to be completely honest. Thank God for masks though, I don't know what Id do this week without them.
Closer to 2, often less. It's follicle by follicle.
I typically tell my clients that I'll clear about the size of a quarter in our first appointment. Subsequent appointments will alternate between expanding that quarter and hitting regrowth while the root structure is shallow. Towards the end, I reach the point where I'm alternating between halves of the face.
The end result will be worth it, I just gotta keep remembering that
Thank you! It's literally my favorite part of my wardrobe 🚶🏻‍♀️
So a few things
1. hehehehehehehehe thank you so much, this put such a big smile on my stubbly face. 🧙‍♂️ (Also I never thought I would be the person that people said goals to, god imma cry 😂😭)
2. I just checked out your profile and you're already freaking gorgeous, you've absolutely got this. 💕 
3. it's the symbol for estrogen! I wanted to sneak some subtle trans themed clothes into my wardrobe and when I found that, I knew I needed it. 👩‍🔬
I just checked out your profile AND WHAT THE HECK, HOW ARE YOU SO PRETTY?! 💕

But seriously, thank you ☺️
Hell to the yeah! Trans people know what's up 🙋‍♀️
Thank you so much for your reply, it's important to go into this with my expectations set appropriately. Thankfully I don't have a ton of facial hair to begin with so hopefully it won't take a crazy long time for me. The not shaving afterwards is going to be FuN especially considering that my skin heals slowly 😎
you’re welcome 😊 

aw i’m sorry hun ❤️ i hope it gets better!
You got this!
Ah okay. I was planning to get my entire body done once I had the money but that seems like that would take a lot longer ;w;
I have found you can (very very carefully) use an electric trimmer to help with this. I use a Phillips Norelco One Blade¹. It gets about as close as a day old shave, but since it isn't raking against the skin, it doesn't seem to cause collateral damage as badly. It's formatted like a razor, but with the added advantage that you can shave in either direction.

---

¹This thing is also great for dealing with body hair. Doesn't cause ingrown hairs, doesn't cost a fortune in razors, and gets the job done faster. It's also *almost* impossible to nick yourself with it, so it takes some of the anxiety out of shaving the more sensitive places.
The density of follicles makes a difference. Body hair is usually much more spaced out than facial hair, meaning a larger area can be covered per session, it also heals faster if the damage is more spread out.

Also, check with your insurance. Some plans cover it for trans people, often under their mental health section.
Thanks for the tip! This has officially been added to my shopping list 💁🏻‍♀️"	ldub5n	trans	391	0.99	2021-02-06 09:59:50

A reminder for the MtF crowd.	"We are girls when we're not wearing makeup. We are girls when we're not wearing clothes. We are girls when we're wearing ""boy clothes."" We are girls when we haven't shaved. We are girls when our voices are deep. We are girls 24 hours a day, 7 days a week.

We are girls. We are loved. We are valid."	"Thanks for this, helps a lot than you know.
Thank you... I have to boy mode 4 days a week at work. I really needed to hear this.
i needed to hear this, thank you
But I don’t look like a girl, people don’t see me as one.
I know my brain lies to me when I've taken off my bra and all my accessories, but you're right! I'm still a girl even without the boobs or the hair band!
This is fortunately and unfortunately facts. If it wasn't true, I'd never have ""chosen"" to be trans. I don't want to be trans, because it threatens my safety, my job security, my pay, my relationships, my budget, and is generally way too much work.

But for the 37 years before I realized I was trans, I was already a woman. My interactions with members of all genders showed it. My friendships and interests showed it. My dating and marriage showed it. My incompleteness showed it.

I am trans because I have always been a woman. I will always be a woman, no matter how I look; No matter what others say; No matter how I feel that day.

I am trans! I am a woman! I am... Working on being proud! 😳
I tell myself this every day. Almost 70 (!), working toward transition, large-bodied, not much feminine about me, except ME! I walked down a busy street to my therapist's office this week with lipstick, mascara, and earrings,  but no wig and no attempt to cover beard shadow, reminding myself the whole time of what I heard someone say on a podcast that a better goal than ""passing"" is ""presenting in a way that demands respect."" That's my goal (of course, I'm also hoping HRT softens my look a little).
This is a good message to start my day with.
not mtf but girls can wear whatever the damn hell they want and it doesnt make them any less of a girl
I love this. I have a hard time remembering that I’m a girl no matter what I look like or how I’m feeling
Thank you so much for stating this! 💖
Thank you

I wish there was an ftm version of this
Hell yeah! I may have a choice like a tuba with a head cold, but I'm a *woman* with a voice like a tuba.
Yeah but like fuckin look at me lol. Case closed
I would want to believe that but I don't deserve to be a girl. I would want to be a girl all time but I'm not brave enough to fully come out and starting to do things towards it. It feels good to think what you said but it gets crushed by my male body.
months of my pre-trans dysphoria kicking my ass i really needed this post, thank you <3
im tryin...
Try not to think of it as boy mode because you're not really a boy. Try to think of it more like stealth mode. I'm sorry you have to hide that part of you.
There are definitely people that see you as a girl (as long as you are out of the closet). The people who dont recognize you are usually people who dont understand or loud annoying pieces of shit that dont understand basic respect and will be rude. It is a lot more difficult to tell someone ""you are a girl"" out of nowhere. Its an odd compliment . It's easier to be one of those assholes with no shame and yell you arent one
Fuck what other people see. It’s one of the best lessons to learn early. Of course regionally this can be dangerous, but I digress.. caring what other people see or think, it’s just a waste of energy that could be put to better use focusing on bettering yourself.

Well for what it's worth, I am already proud of you. You have embraced your truth and that takes a lot of courage. I wish you all the luck in the world.

I see, that’s unfortunate. I wish they would stop doing that to you. You don’t deserve rude people.
Thanks... I'm sort of doing a 180 out of transphobia and I'm really proud to be owning that and becoming better... But it is gonna take a while before I fully come to terms with everything and see myself the way I should. 😅

ftm bf is pregnant	so we are deeply in love, and now he's pregnant (we are beyond thrilled). it's early days but he's going to need maternity clothes.  I've tried Google searches but am coming up with a company that folded. anyone have any advice about where we can get some maternity wear for men?	"r/seahorse_dads is where he needs to visit
technically its **p**aternity since hes a father, not a mother. but definitely try the big & tall sections of stores. before i lost weight, JCP had a good selection (the stuff that Shaq endorses. good stuff) that i bought from a lot
Big and tall.  Lots of men look pregnant with their big belly
AFAB here, just gave birth a few months ago. I’m enby. Just wanted to let you know, I grew an enormous belly but I never bothered with maternity clothes. I just wore sweatpants with drawstrings and large, stretchy shirts the whole time. That may not be an option due to work, but it’s one way to find clothing.
I don't really have any suggestions on where to find clothes for you bf, but I just want to say congratulations! I'm sure you two will be wonderful parents!💜
What about finding a friend who sews? I would love to make clothes for someone like him!  Shit... Maybe I'll start a clothing line.lol.  also, are you guys in the states?  I would suggest finding an awesome doula to help with the birth of you are.   Best wishes and congratulations!
I just wanted to say, congrats to both of you!
Ok when I was pregnant I never wore maternity clothes. Just my regular clothes and then near the end of the pregnancy bought a few sweatpants and pj pants in some bigger sizes. And I was huge. So there really isn't a need for special pregnancy clothes
+size mens stores are a good bet, I've seen cis men with beer bellys far bigger than any pregnant tum.
Yay! Congratulations to the both of you!
I wish you all the best! I want to be pregnant and raise children with my best friend, it's great to see other trans men wanting the same ☺️
I also never wore specific pregnancy clothes bc they were expensive and too girly (I’m non-binary). Lots of thrift store pants with elastic waists was what I did. The maternity section does have pants that look gender neutral if paired with the right top. Longer Baggie T-shirts on top.
That's great. I feel so happy for you two! I wish you folks the best. It's nice seeing something so happy like this.
How is he rn?
That is such a beautiful subreddit <3 

I know it's not meant specifically for me, but still, thank you for showing me!
yes paternity is true I, with his permission, used maternity for clarity. thanks for the advice.
I feel attacked.
Start that clothing line! FTM pregnancies becoming more and more commonplace!

I personally could NEVER carry and birth a child, but some do and thats come crazy mental strength right there.
Haha. 
Well this is one very preventable condition.   Diet and exercise and bam your belly is gone.
Working on it!!
Unsolicited advice and bam, easy as that.
That’s super fatphobic. It’s not that simple at all. Oops this was a response to someone who was like “eat less and exercise more, d*mmy!” when someone else talked about struggling with weight.
The single fastest way is to eat zero processed food, drink lots of water and get sleep.  

Don’t starve yourself either.  Just eat clean, and be more active.  Also don’t hit the scale more than every couple weeks.
I kicked anything but coffee, unsweet tea and water to the curb. I lost a lot a few years ago doing that and training for 5ks. Then Covid. Then new job. Then deaths. I ate a lot of feelings. Cracking my egg a month ago had spurred me back though.

People love femboys so much, until they're trans.	"I'm a feminine, ftm gay guy. Nobody sees me as a real man, even suspect some of my friends of this because of misgendering. I've been feminine, not really attractive, my whole life and i can't get on t because of my age and side effects.
When I told people I'm also gay mlm, with zero attraction to girls, i just know they shit on my identity, they just see me as a cishet girl with extra steps, even tho I've tried to make it clear thousands of times I've never seen myself as a girl. My feminine appearance is not something I can change, and i don't want to get rid of the clothes i like.
My point is, everyone praises cis femboys for dressing feminine and ""fighting gender norms"",but the second you, as a trans guy, show any little sign of feminity, an army of cishets will feel so attaked.
Not to mention how annoying cis quirky ""ally"" girls form tiktok are. I noticed how their ""go off handsome king!!"" kind of comments stop the secon you don't act like a little soft kid who tries everything to be attractive and masculine."	"That really sucks that you're dealing with this shit.

Performative queerness is, unfortunately, very real, as you're showing us. Cisallohetero society is unfortunately hanging over all of us. And recently I've been seeing queer people use it as a hammer against other queer people, which is so unhelpful.

Just sucks. 

Wish I could help.
Have you heard of r/ftmfemininity ? I know it doesn’t erase what you’re going through, but I think it’s helpful to have a community of guys going through what you are
I'm also a feminine transmasc, I feel you. :(
Trans mend don’t owe you masculinity, trans women don’t owe you femininity, enbies don’t owe you androgyny, be you
I’m mtf and that word is still used to misgender me, I hadn’t even *considered* how it affects transmascs. Awful origins of the word aside it almost feels like it’s continued existence perpetuates the existence of gender norms… a guy can’t just dress or act feminine, there has to be a label, and the label implies that it’s not normal in a sense?

The situation you find yourself in absolutely sucks, bordering on transmedicalism. You’re valid, and i hope things’ll get better for you :(
I’m a trans tomboy, I feel you
Yeah a lot of trans ""allies"" only support you when you fit their idea of what a transmasc/transfem/enby person should act like and when you don't they start saying you're not being trans the right way
Yep its the same way people love a tragedy about a little boy whose abusive mom forces him to wear dressed because she always wanted a daughter until its a little trans boy because that's to be expected for us.
That's true, I'm a feminine trans boy and people always say ""You're not a real boy if you dress like that"", while they will go crazy of ""breaking gender norms"" if they see a cis femboy. It really shows that they just respect you if you fit in the stereotypes of a cis boy, if you are feminine and trans you ""are just faking it"" and ""aren't a real boy"". 

I hope you can get the respect that you deserve on being what you want to be, good luck.
I believe you! You are a man in my eyes.
You're not responsible for whatever it is that reminds them of a girl. You're a boy ❤️
There are of course also people who accept you just the way you are! 🤗 I see you, brother! ✊
Tik tok with any community sucks. Tik Tok business model celebrifying people (which is just giving them complexes, inflated egos, and brain rot) no matter the amount of misinformation they peddle.  I could extend this to any social media platform. Even here with the Karma system, but Tik Tok ought to be the worst in many cases.  


Ask most diagnosed DID systems about systems on Tiktok, and you won't hear the end of it.  


Seriously, don't ask me. I will rant.
are you me? did i post this in my sleep?
hey going through the same thing here fellow feminine trans fella:’)
Where do people love femboys?

Only on the internet maybe.In the real worls they are bullied and harassed
I'm also ftm. I dunno is it weird that if I was a cis man, I'd wanna be a femboy, but as a trans man the thought of putting on a skirt just makes my blood boil with self hate?? *Trans confusion intensifies*

Maybe my thoughts will change after starting hormone treatment (or after surgery maybe?)

My town is super conservative. When I first started transitioning I got my clothes from a conservative Christian thrift store. One day I moved the mirror to get a better angle. Turns out I wasnt the only one...		"Goddamn thats so fuckin cute and sweet
That’s amazing! So cool to see small town trans people supporting each other. 
GOD said not 2 judge!

I love all this diverse, anonymous love and support. Kinda like Reddit.

I love you too!
thats so sweet omg
something that took me forever to realize is that cis opinions will always be the loudest and seemingly most heard. they might be the loudest, but just cuz they are made by some loud individuals. there are a lot more of us around than we think, but just scared to say much. its really excellent seeing something like this <33
That's so sweet. I wish you all could have met. I live in a small conservative town too and I've kind of fantasized about meeting other LGBT+ people here. Surely they're others.
Literally in tears seeing this.  💞💖😊
We are everywhere!
i thought “wow this is cute” and then i opened it and 😭😭😭
This is sweet, but also so terrifying to me. The anxiety that it gives me to think about all of these people, wondering if they're okay, if they moved somewhere better, things like that. This sucks so bad to have to hide this way.

I wish you the best of luck, OP.

Its messages. 

On a board!!!
Your 100 percent right
Admittedly, I've thought about buying a domain and putting it on the board for all the LGBT kids to meet up. 

Maybe you can find a crooked mirror in your local thrift store to do the same!
That would be really cool.
I'm gonna have to! Next time my family heads to town I'll have to find a way to get into the changing room at our thrift shop and leave a message.

Normal people look at you and go ""oh well, another idiot"". There is a ton of research about transgender people, including the fact that is not defined purely by genitals. There are multiple determinants of one's gender, including psychological and social ones. Perhaps you are the one who should go and read a book.

**Brain Gender**

Brain Gender  is a book by Melissa Hines, Hines graduated with an undergraduate degree from Princeton, following through with a doctorate in psychology from UCLA.  Currently, Hines is a psychologist and neuroscientist at the University of Cambridge.

Brain Gender is a book exploring the biological differences between sex and gender. Hines questions whether or not different biological differences, such as hormones, affect the way people develop and act. Hines demonstrates the possibilities that genetic, biological, neuroendocrine, behavioral, social, and statistical aspects of born sex affect the differences between males or females in gender roles.In the end of the book, it is concluded that the human tendency to perceive generalized gender differences is not supported by evidence.

Son wanting girls things	"I have a 5 year old autistic son who is my pride and joy. He’s always been interested in stereotypical girls toys such as baby dolls, dolls house etc. he has some girls Hey Duggee pyjamas and chose himself 2 play suits to wear during the summer. I allow him to be his free self. 

The other day he told me he doesn’t want to be a boy, and didn’t want to be a boy when he was little. I told him it’s fine to feel that way, and just because he’s a boy, it doesn’t mean he can’t enjoy girls things. He likes to occasionally wear make up and get his nails done with me. 

I’m now just wondering if I should change my approach. Should I begin actively taking interest in “girl” things with him? Or should I continue to wait until he requests such things? 

I have no issue if he is gay/trans/undecided. As long as he is healthy and happy and a decent person.

Edit: this should really be titled something else because its not really about him wanting “girls things” but more on how to support his choices. Also for anyone who may not like the way I may word somethings, please remember I am talking to a 5 year old autistic child who needs language simplified. I have told him he can play with whatever toys he wants, wear what clothes he wants (I’m going to take him shopping and let him choose all his own things). Thank you for the comments so far."	"Consider also r/cisparenttranskid.  Just support them for now and take their lead. If they're trans then great and no permanent decision will be made for a long time. If he's just feminine that's great too. They'll figure themselves out in time. Just give them the space to explore. Side note: I think trans people are more likely to be nuerodivergant but I don't recall the percentage increase
Trans people are much more likely to be autistic or neurodivergent than the general population. It doesn't mean that they are trans, but they are asserting a gender identity really hard at a young age. Some kids just know and I think your child does. The big thing here is freedom and acceptance and I think you're doing a good job with that.

It is pretty dismissive for them to tell you that they don't want to be a boy and for you to respond with boys can do girly things too. Liking girly things and being a girl are two different things. I would ask your child whether they want to be referred to as a girl or boy and respect their wishes. They might change their mind in the future, but that would be perfectly fine!

I think you should engage with your kid and do things that interest them or that you think will interest them. It doesn't have to be intensely gendered. But, yeah, do girly things with them as well as not girly things.
You never made them feel like they couldn't do certain things as a boy, so if they say they want to be a girl, it's probably not just about them liking girly things.  


You should at the very least teach them that trans people exist and that you'd be okay with them being trans.  


And it's okay if they think they're trans but they're not. Let them explore, there is nothing inherently harmful about it, while taking away their agency on the matter is inherently harmful even if the person making decisions in their place were right. Autistic people often struggle with people taking away their agency, so this is doubly important
if they tell you they don’t want to be a boy and have never wanted to be a boy, responding by telling them they’re a boy is invalidating and dismissive, even if it’s in the context of telling them they can be whatever kind of boy they want. you’re still mandating their gender even if you’re not policing it’s expression.
I suggest you check out Gender Spectrum, an organization with resources specifically for families with children like yours. https://genderspectrum.org/

One thing I've heard is that a trans child will be ""persistent, insistent and consistent"" in expressing their identity. If that describes your child's interest in being a girl, it might be worthwhile to let them experiment with living as one. Keep in mind that names, pronouns, and wardrobe changes are easy, low-risk and require no long-term commitment. It's not like your child is getting any irreversible changes done.
Well my advise is to try and see a therapist specialised in trans healthcare so you can support your kid to the fullest if he does turn out to be a trans girl. If he doesnt then theres no harm done.

Thank you for being an amazing parent, not too many people ask for help from trans peeps regarding trans stuff and the fact that youre trying already means the world
Im autistic and also knew when I was very young, probably 7 or 8 for sure. I didn't start medically/socially transitioning until I was 24, and I was in denial for my entire teenage years. I can say that if I had supportive family as a kid, and had the freedom to just *be* a girl at that age, my childhood would've been so much more fulfilling and less traumatizing. 

I try really hard to focus on the positives, that I can live happily as a girl now. But I, and most trans people I know, feel like they missed out on a full childhood. I also have permanent changes from puberty that could've been halted.  

It seems like you take your child seriously, which is awesome to see. I don't think it's too early to have the conversation about whether they want to be a boy or girl, or neither, and treat that seriously. However, my advice is, I think it's important for you to create an environment where gender and expression can be playful and fun too. Part of what held me back for so long was the idea that gender and sexuality were a fire and brimstone topic (southern baptist yeehaw). Good luck!
I think some people in this thread are jumping the gun in deciding that your kids is trans. Just let your kid do their thing and be supportive of whatever their interests and choices are, there's no need to make major life decisions at this age
Usually you shouldn’t assume someone is trans because they like stuff that’s stereotyped to be liked by the other gender, but if they say they don’t want to be the gender assigned to them at birth, then it’s safe to assume they’re trans
Honestly it sounds like you're doing great. Kids, especially neuro-divergent kids, need to come to things on their own. The best thing you can do is not to be an obstacle, and you're doing a great job at that from the sound of it.

If your child wants to do ""girly"" activities, participate, but I'm not sure initiating is the best thing here. I've worked with a few neuro-divergent kids (I'm neuro-divergent myself) and it's always a challenge to figure out the best way to communicate with them.

It sounds like you love your child and that they know that in their own way. And they get that you support however they choose to express themselves in positive ways.
Hello my lovely 💛 you sound like a lovely parent and I'm so glad your child has you. I think it's best to just follow their lead, if they want to do something girly then encourage it and support it but sometimes they might want to do something that is typically a boy thing. Dont overthink it too much they will find themselve and grow up happy if you support them. Also I would suggest if they are saying they don't want to be a boy, instead of saying you can do girl things maybe try saying they can be a girl you want 😊 it's small but I think it will help them feel safe and free to be who they are if their gender is a choice rather than what gender norms they do. I hope this help💛
Probably let them know that being a girl is a thing that they can do.

I am also autistic and had those signs but I wasn't really told I was allowed to be a girl, and all the culture thrown on top of little boys is the whole ""boys rule, girls drool"" stuff which can caused me to hide my dysphoria until my life dissolved in front of my eyes.

Tbh, just be glad they are telling you this. A full childhood of dysphoria can cause a ton of damage to someone psyche.
Just want to say you sound like a supportive parent regardless of your child's path and wish there were more parents like you out there!  

I think just letting them figure out themselves at their own pace and giving them that space and support to do so is amazing, like you are doing.  If they are interested and want to share, I think they always appreciate that encouragement 😊
Just wanted to say that i love seeing posts like these, it makes me so happy to see good, supportive parents out there :)

My advise is let your kid experiment! Ask them what feels right and definitely ask about pronouns! If you keep an open mind and lead with love you’ll do great ☺️
You do just that, support him. Get him kids books about different genders, sexualities, books about two same gendered parents etc and see what happens. He very likely lacks better words, as would many children that age. Or maybe hes just drawn to the color scheme of toys marketed for girls. Who knows!? Just keep listening, letting him lead, and believing him no matter what.

I have a 4yo who loves girls things but is 100% sure her p3nis is in the mail and she does NOT want a period ever but shes going to make babies one day. Idk what that means in her mind right now and i dont really care. Shes 4. Im just creating a safe space for her to keep this conversation going.
(Trans Guy) the best thing you can do is let them explore their identity. Ask them if they want to be called a girl and if they say yes then start doing so until your kid is around 12-13-14 then ask them if they still feel like a girl and want to go on puberty blockers which are 100% reversible if they decide that's not them. If They do go on puberty blockers and still know they are a girl then at 16 you can do hormone therapy. But for now just support your child since there aren't many parents that do.
I don't know? I'd just let him decide on what toys and stuff he wants to do. Though I will say it's a little odd for him to be exploring his ""gender""(?) this early. But he's probably just being a kid and I wouldn't think too much into it. There's no real way he understands gender at this point in his life. If he's trans he more than likely won't know and won't come out until he reaches his tweens/teens. The most important thing to remember is that being gay/trans isn't a choice and nothing you do can really stop it from happening. Also remember that gender and sexuality aren't connected, he could end up being a trans woman that likes women. Just remember to be supportive of him and do not keep from doing ""girl things"" if that's what he wants to do. Though as I said he's probably just being a kid and doesn't really think anything of it or understands the concept of gender yet. 

Also you could do some research into having a trans child just in case it comes around. There's is a term in the trans community called an ""egg"" that he would fall under if he was trans. Just remember also if he does turn out to be trans and mentions wanting to start hormones (and ultimately this is your choice) it is far easier to transition during actually puberty. I regret and somewhat resent my parents every day for not letting me start hormone replacement therapy at 13 when I wanted to because now daily I have to shave facial hair and body hair every week or so.
Sounds like your child is trans. You should take them seriously, listen to them, and make this an open point of conversation.

Also maybe refer to them in neutral or feminine ways if they've expressed that they're not a boy.
(Second paragraph): this really triggered me, too
It's wonderful your supportive of your trans kid.
[removed]
https://youtu.be/9LTaBGDrw4M

Watch that video. It might help.
Encourage exploration? Try feminine and masculine things together.
just have a conversation about it, ask them these things, I would also ask if they would like to try new pronouns and/ or name
So this is actually something that can be hard to place. A number of trans people are autistic (myself included) and a number of autistic people may question their gender, but are not trans. It is all very complicated and I don't understand it all myself but what I do know is I and others precieve gender differently, and while there is a link to that and being trans, it is not necessarily the case either. I am not a parent but I do know that things would have been a lot easier for me if I had a parent who supported my interest in toys of the other gender, and talked to me about gender expression and the idea of being trans. I can't tell you if your kid will grow up to transition one day, maybe even in the next year, but I do know that he will always break the mold when it comes to gender stereotypes, and that is something that should be supported. I don't know if that helps, and I think you are already doing that to some degree or another, but I think support, education and letting him chose what he will is the best way to go, and let him give you signals of his needs and preferences.
Going against the grain here, but I do not think you need to/should ask you child to decide whether they want to be a boy or a girl, then based on their response, make commitments to that ( e.g. refering to them as a girl thereafter) particularly without them asking for that thenselves. especially at such an early age. I think you don't need to ask your child searching questions about these things in general and can just accept them and follow their own lead as they explore their own identity, while offering an accepting environment for them. I think these are huge questions to ask a very young child while they are still exploring gender and its essentially like forcing someone out of the closet e.g. asking your child if they are gay or straight. I think that continuing to accept and support whatever interests your child has and giving totally neutral and accepting responses to comments about the child's own gender is more helpful e.g. child ""I want to be a girl"" adult: ""OK :)"". You can just create a generally accepting environment by making comments such as ""you can be whatever you want to be"" and ""I will always love you whatever happens"". I think you can treat the feminine interests as you would any ither interests in a childs life, you dont need to prticualaly encourage or doscourage them, just show accepting appreciation and enthusiasm. I also don't think you should be worried that telling him he is a boy was wrong or harmful. Obviously I don't know your child or how aware he is of gender yet, but I can only imagine its very basic as he's only 5. many autistic 5 yos haven't yet or have only very recently began to actually understand/recognise gender in its most basic sense yet, and even typically developing children normally develop typical use of pronouns he/she/him/her/his around 4. Its relevant for many typically developing children to explain and help label boy/girl/man/woman just for them to get the basic idea that gender exists before they can even understand their own gender identity based off that.
Sounds like you're on the right track.   Just love and support him no matter what and make sure you always listen to what he says, not what you want to hear or think he means.
Support him. If he turns out to be cis, cool! Trans? Also cool! Maybe go to someone specialized with that kinda stuff.

The best thing to do is to acknowledge your child's identity early on. I was like him when I was younger (though I wanted to be the opposite of a girl) but I didn't have the same support you give your kid, and that caused a bit of issues with figuring out my identity. Just give your kid unconditional love!
The medical/biological reasons why remain mysterious, but there does seem to be a significant correlation between being on the spectrum and being gender non-conforming: Lots of autistic people are trans, and lots of trans people are somewhere on the spectrum. So that's something to be aware of.

But yeah, I'd changing your wording if I were you. It's not about ""it's ok to like girl things even if you're a boy"". Because honestly, you don't *know* if he's a boy. All you know is that he has a body that has a masculine configuration. But you can't read his mind. You can't look in there and determine what his gender identity is. He's the only one with access to his own thoughts and feelings. He's the only one who can observe his own inner sense of gender.

And he seems to be telling you that ""boy"" ain't it.

Obviously, approach with caution: don't rush into anything, given the language challenges your kid faces, make sure you understand what he actually means by what he's telling you. But ultimately, this is about respecting your kid's authority about his/her/their own identity.

And make sure that both you and your kid know that there's a difference between how your body is configured and what gender you actually feel like. For most people they match, sure, but for trans people they don't. That's the core of being trans.

There may be language challenges, but your kid is probably not dumb, right? So I think if you can educate them about the difference between gender identity (internal; only self-observable) and gender expression (external, visible to all), that you can trust them to think about that and accurately report to you whether these two aspects of themselves match (cis) or don't match (trans).
Your child reminds me of myself when I was around his age. We said and wanted similar things. Also, I’m autistic
Part of the problem with our society is that people feel like they have to ""pick a side!""  Why can't boys who like girl things and girls who like girl things just be and act and dress as they please, at a young age or as adults?  Women wear stereotypical male clothing all the time and have been doing so for a century (in this country anyway).  Hopefully, sooner rather than later, it won't matter what a guy wears in public any more than it does for a woman.  Feel like a dress, wear a dress, feel like stockings and heels, wear em to work or to the club.  Clothing and toys and games do not have gender and we harm our children by shoving them in the artificial boxes which society dictates.

I applaud your openness in supporting your child.  My advice would be simple to support them and love them no matter what they eventually determine is their path.
I don't know how to help but I want to say you are an amazing mom and the fact that you want the best for your child no matter who they are or want to be is an inspiration for any other parent wanting to do best by their child
Stop treating toys and activities and clothes like they're gendered and just let your kid do what they wanna do. Let them know that they don't have to be a boy *or* a girl, but they can be if they want to be, it doesn't matter. Don't choose things based on gender but just on if they sound like they could be fun.

Is it likely your kid is trans? Yeah, it's pretty likely from the sounds of things. Does that mean you should be pushing them in the direction of *any* gender roles? No, that's all stuff for your kid to work out for themselves. You just have to be open and supportive, and you need to be more open to the notion that gender isn't really as important as we often grow up believing.
It's amazing that you are supporting your child, no matter what they want to be. You could attempt going up to your child and offering to do one of these activities (e.g. nail painting, playing with dolls).
When they say they want to be a girl, your response is just to assume that they want to do girly things. It’s rarely that simple and often goes much deeper than that. Do they feel discomfort at the thought of being a boy? Have you asked why they want to be a girl? The best thing you can do is attempt to understand and in turn help them understand their own feelings. It’s also important to keep in mind that sexuality≠gender identity and gender identity is a separate concept from gender expression!
Neurodivergent people are 6-10 times more likely to be transgender, and about 10-15 times more likely to be LGBTQ+
This, absolutely this! Was actually wondering about the link between neurodivergence and genderissues too as I've come across quite some people with ADHD in other genderrelated groups.
Yeah, I would add irt the language used being dismissive, I'm autistic and I even now would not be sure exactly how to respond to just being told it's ok to like doing girly things. If I were you, op, I would now, after the fact, follow up and communicate explicit affirmation, as Lilly said here
⬆️ This!! 


I think 5 is a bit too young to even worry about whether a child is trans or not. I’d be supportive and let them choose their own path within reason. 
You are a great parent 😊
It’s not at all odd for him to be exploring his gender at 5. Many trans people have vivid memories of doing so at that age and being aware there is something “off” 
even younger. I myself remember being 3/4 learning to keep my curiosity and confusion to myself because it was condemned by my Christian family. I’m glad kids today can live in a more supportive world.
(Second paragraph about calling the child a Boy): this really triggered me, too

Sorry I meant this as a comment to what Iamcalledlilly wrote.
Ewww go somewhere else
yeah, didn't one study show that 1/4 of trans people are autistic?
Source?
can you gimme a source so i can send it to my parents

That study says

""autistic adults and adolescents are approximately eight times more likely to identify as asexual and ‘other’ sexuality than their non-autistic peers. And there were sex differences in sexual orientation: autistic males are 3.5 times more likely to identify as bisexual than non-autistic males, whereas autistic females are three times more likely to identify as homosexual than non-autistic females.""

Didn't see anything about trans folks in that study summary, but I will keep digging.

edit: here we go -- https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32770077/
Can confirm as an autistic transgender individual
But wasn’t it also stated that neurodivergent people are more likely to look into those things, especially earlier on, than their neurotypical counterparts? Simply because we’re less likely to just go along with something when it doesn’t feel right.
Honestly I don’t think it’s that trans people are more likely to be neurodivergent but that neurodivergent people are more likely to come out as trans. There’s already a degree of separation from “normalcy” for a lot of neurodivergent people so we’re a lot more likely to consider we may be different from most people in other ways too
1st year psych dropout so take my opinion with a grain of salt. 

my hypothesis is that a lot of people on the autism spectrum do not see the normal, in-built societal norms. things like making eye contact, body language, certain behaviours, etc. and i think gender tends to be one of those. instead of it just being ""this is how it is for everyone"" autistic folks will go ""why though?"" 

again, i'm not doctor, speaking purely from anecdotal/my own experience as an autistic trans woman.
Oh.
lol
“Our group of people has a high suicide rate. The increase in social acceptance has increased our suicide rate. Your identity is a construction. You should encourage parents to construct their children’s identity around our group. Who cares if encouraging that will cause suicidal ideation”

You are advocating for a parent to treat their child poorly. The child is 5 years old. 

Think about what you are actually advocating
I think its 1/4 of trans folks are on the spectrum including things like ADD/ADHD.
I think so. It’s been over a year, and I read numerous studies.
Multiple studies including news media. I forget how I started down that path, but I believe there a study that is either Danish or Dutch that would be a place to start.
[https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq](https://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/autistic-individuals-are-more-likely-to-be-lgbtq)

There are plenty of Google results alongside this one article
Yeah, I read something in the neighborhood of 10-20 different articles a little over a year ago to come up with my numbers. Sounds like I need to up them again, maybe.
They’ve done neurology studies that show gay brains function differently than straight brains. Trans brains function in line with gender identity, not sex assigned at birth. Age of exposure is irrelevant to the subject. Neurodivergent people are more likely to be LGBTQ+.
Yeah,this. NDs are more likely to be queer. 

It's thought that since we don't follow social rules as much it could be due to being able to come out/accept ourselves easier, but that part is t fact, just one theory.
I’m ND myself and came to similar conclusions some time ago.  ND folks are just used to being different and tend to accept the idea of being different in other ways more readily.  I don’t think that there being a higher percentage of ND folks is just true for identifying as trans but for any divergence from social norms on gender and sexuality.  We’re more habituated to being different.

I have seen higher than average ND rates among the local trans, ace, queer (in the broader sense), kink and polyamorous communities.  When you start overlapping those groups, the ND rate soars.  Among the trans folks in the kink community around here, at least half are ND and they’re almost always queer and poly too.  It’s like at some point we just come to terms with not following the social norm and are more willing to just try to explore the non-traditional.  Being ND doesn’t make us divergent on sex and gender but it definitely makes us more self-accepting if we are and thus more visible and out about it.

Our social awkwardness can actually insulate us from social pressures that neurotypical folks seem to experience (e.g. I have trouble noticing a disapproving look at my presentation from a stranger or understanding why I should care much even if I do notice it - as long as the people who are important to me are accepting, I’m good).  I don’t feel shame about being different.  I just am different and I am pretty okay with that.  

My neurotypical friends often seem to think I am courageous for being so openly different but I don’t think I am.  I think I just don’t internalize pressure to conform like they do so I never have to overcome the challenges they are projecting onto me based on their experiences and thinking.  It’s the ""marching to the beat of my own drummer"" thing, not bravery.
mad? i'm transitioning and happy, you're definitely bitchless
Thanks, I’m not doubting, it’s just a pretty staggering stat and I was curious where you saw it.
thanks
Idc if you’re mad. You’re more than welcome to dress what you want, take pills, and have surgeries. Go wild. This thread is about a 5 year old CHILD.

I family respects every trans person except me	"I really don’t get it. I’ve been out since I was 13, literally bagged up and threw away my old clothes, chopped all of my hair off, started T, and socially transitioned to the point where I was completely stealth for 2 years, and my family still treats me like I’m going through a quirky phase. 

My sister idolizes multiple trans celebrities, will threaten anyone who misgenders her trans coworker, and is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has trans friends she fully supports, but when it comes to me it’s like I never transitioned. They all ask me for advice on trans things, make sure to never accidentally put my binders in the dryer if my laundry gets mixed with theirs, and consider men who are attracted to me gay, but then they introduce me as “the family lesbian” and get mad when people “assume I’m a guy”

Has anyone else had this experience?? I feel like I’m going insane sometimes."	">I family respects every trans person

No they don't. They perform respect, but they don't actually have respect for those other trans people if that's the way they treat you.
This is... very strange. Have you ever confronted them about it/ask why they do this?
My sister would still aggressively gender me as my agab after I came out to her for years and has never apologized for it. She's big into performatively supporting LGBT people and now that I've socially transitioned she respects my identity but she refuses to apologize for the constant misgendering and gave me a laundry list of excuses when I told her it upset me. Idk family sucks. /:
Wow, I'd normally say that it's them talking the talk but not walking the walk.

But they're mostly walking the walk...?

What the fuck?

My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? Or they're SO good at faking allyism that they don't outright come off as transphobes. You have got to bring it up with them, that's the only way you can grasp what's happening in their heads.

Clearly they see you differently in some way. Why? Well that's what you need to figure out.

If this shit doesn't stop, I'd recommend cutting them off completely. Idk how old you are, but it seems you're either a young adult or nearly one. It's a tough world and economy and all that, so stay safe and stable. But if you can get away from them, that might be the only way.

Maybe it's the vindictiveness in me, but that would definitely show them there er of their ways. Hopefully it doesn't come to that! 

Much love, you deserve better my man. 👉✨
My family is the same. My sister will starts fights about someone trans from twitter being misgendered but keeps using my deadname and saying ""I don't have to use your name, right? it's just so ugly"". 
My mum also refused to use my name at all until I complained about my dad being transphobic (they are divorced and they compete to be the best). Then she used my name for a while but keeps using my deadname and excusing herself, and saying that she chose my deadname and she does not want to give it up. But she will proudly deffend trans people she meets at work.

Apparently, when we are family, we fall under different rules.
Family and old friends have been the worst in my experience, ditch them all as soon as you can, move somewhere fabulous and start a new life.
This was my grandmother for the LONGEST time!!! My grandma would try so hard to be respectful of other trans people (although she was never great at it but she visibly tried) meanwhile she would get MAD at ME if I very gently asked her to try harder in gendering me correctly.
Infact one time when I corrected her on my name she gave me the most evil smile and cooed out ""Well on your birth certificate~""

Now do I recommend doing what I did in retaliation? Not really; but it's what I did in response to my situation.

I stopped responding.
Dead name being called? Nope. Don't care how loud they scream or bitch or complain.
Call me dead name in public? I'd literally apologize to the person and tell them she was having a dementia episode when I knew she could hear me from a distance.
Buy me female clothes? Act insanely confused and kept putting them in her laundry everytime she snuck them in mine.

It was a l o n g and misrible battle but eventually she began having to respect me. If I don't respond until I hear my name, she has to use my name. If I act like I have no clue who she's referring to when she dead name's me to a stranger, she has to use my proper name to seem sane.

And eventually over time she began to actually see me as male, and although she still says some pretty offensive shit sometimes (for example yesterday she said I still have a 'female laugh' and that has created a huge amount of insecurity in me 🙄), she doesn't misgender or dead name me unless she is in a super mentally frazzled state (and it's very visibly a mental blep as she'll catch herself instantly and laugh at herself and ask why she said it)

So ... Yeah TLDR; Your family doesn't see you as male. You can either be a complete cock head (like me lol) or be passive and polite (which doesn't seem to be working in your situation.) It depends on how comfortable you are with conflict. Wishing you the best dude
My partners mother is the same, will respect my name and pronouns and some of his other friends but when it comes to him its constant misgendering and deadnaming and i do not understand it
People react very differently when its a spectacle on TV rather than a family member sullying their gene pool. And TV just got past the ""haha man in a dress"" spectacle and started this trend where every trans person is put on a pedestal because they're beautiful and an outspoken and are perfectly prepared to answer invasive questions without being caught off guard, and the unintended consequence is that if you don't fit that image then people feel the need to gatekeep so we don't make ""real"" trans people look bad and the irony is completely lost on them.
My parents and grandma are like this, they oo and ah at trans people in the media but at the same time have only made a handful of attempts to gender me correctly. They literally put up a banner saying 'Birthday Boy' and proceeded to misgender me.
>My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? 

I'd bet it's this. People do grieve for the loss of the brother/sister they *thought* they had and grew up with and it's hard on families to give up what they've known so deeply and closely. It is super easy to respect trans people you only know as trans, but when it's a family member people get weird, like all the hard shit is suddenly in their face.

Super worth talking to them about it IMO. I think they never really latched on to the idea of what happened or something. I feel like the other allyship isn't just performative and that they're just not fully grasping they need to treat a family member the same way, or they love you and it's hard for them to believe they're hurting you when they don't see it or feel it. It's one of those situations where it's like ""OP knows I love them, we're fine"".
I know this isn't an option for everyone, but ever since I could remember I would ask my mom what name she had picked if I had been a girl. She always said there wasn't one because she wanted a boy and wouldn't answer. Then when I came out to her it turned out that she did have another name picked. So my name is still a name my parents had chosen for me. 

That may not have been an option if I had a little sister. And depending on how young someone is, parents may be waiting to pick names until after the ultrasound, but I'm pretty sure parents think about both names before they get pregnant."	sv7v3v	trans	358	0.99	2022-02-18 03:36:23
how do I stop my parents from questioning if I'm trans	"I'm a 13yr old ftm and I've know it since I was a child. And I came out to my parents 2yrs ago like 2 times. But all they did was to make me feel even worse.

I started dressing more feminine and letting my hair grow just for them to forgot, but I don't feel like me. 

I want to dress with clothes that make me feel comfortable, and a new short-medium haircut but I'm scared that they will not let me because they will think I'm trans again. Any advices to make them agree with it?

edit: I think I'm 100% genderfluid but thanks all for the advices! I will still think if I want to be more feminine or masculine <3"	"We can only pretend for so long without driving ourselves absolutely crazy.
You can get a pixie cut, it's considered a feminine haircut but it's pretty short
You can just pretend to be a tomboy or just answer „I just like it more this way. This looks good imo.“. 
After all rather masculine women do exist, too. Tomboys, butches, gender non-conforming women.
One word. ""Pockets"" women's clothing 90% of the time assumes you're carrying a purse, therefore you get no pockets. Men's clothing on the other hand assumes you need to carry half your worldly possessions so gives you 12 inch deep pockets. And in some cases like 9 of them.
Sounds like They’re in hard denial and sometimes parents can’t let go of who/how they thought you were. 

Don’t give up.
dont ask. just go to the hairdresser's and do it. i dont understand these parents not letting their kid grow their hair. i remember i just said i dont need a haircut whenever it came up (like later teens, i was an obedient lil kid, so whatever hair mom wanted) 

&#x200B;

what are you afraid they will do if you have your hair cut yourself?
I might be in the minority, but don't try to get your parents on board if there's any possibility they might kick you out ESPECIALLY if you have nowhere else to go. You can be  tomboy or masc """"for a girl"""" but, if they're this deep into denial, I doubt they can be brought over to the light side. Be careful and take care not only of your health, but of your safety too.
You could say you were tricked previously into thinking you were trans and realized you're really just a tomboy, playing into transphobic ideas might help you get a shorter more masc haircut and more masc clothes. Though they might just hate gender nonconformity in general too
Take a deep breath, relax and acknowledge the thought and let it go...
I'm afraid that at your age, it's very difficult to convince your parents. Cause phases are so normal during puberty. However, it's not impossible. I'd just give it time. Eventually they might come around or you have to be direct with them. This is who you are and they gonna have to deal with it. I'd advice being patient. I know that's very difficult at that age, but trust me. It's never too late to start transitioning and you got a long life ahead of you. If they don't come around by the time you're old enough to move out on your own, you can put your foot down and take control of your own life. Just make sure you're safe, and never give up in finding out who you are.
Pretend without driving crazy
ask your parents to take you to a dr or therapist, explain it to them, and have them explain it to the parents.
Tell them you’re going full time scenster, by comparison they should be cool with u after that 

✌️💕🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍⚧️
yup, i’ve known i was trans since i was 10. my parents told me if i was ever trans they wouldn’t want anything to do with me but like u said it’s driving me crazy
I can attest to this. I had to slink back into the closet a myriad of times for others in my life, and I started to slowly drive myself insane.
Yeah... I've known i was trans since i was 8, my mom puts me down for it, but wearing the clothes i want and having a short haircut I'm so much more confident and proud of myself."	vti775	trans	348	0.98	2022-07-07 13:01:44

Am I trans or fetishizing it because I don’t bind (Story below Pls read)	"I am a trans man who has recently came out, I identify as a man and as far as I’m aware that’s valid— but just a little while ago another trans man told me I am fetishizing being trans because, 1. I don’t bind and 2. I have no interest in top surgery. I was told I was making fun of and mocking those who have committed suicide because they were stuck with the parts they were born with and I was “flaunting them around” (context was I took a picture of myself FULLY CLOTHED wearing a shirt with the trans flag on it) this whole experience seriously shook me and it hurt, I cried for nearly a solid hour afterwards. I’ve been questioning myself ever sense. Is me identifying as a trans man transphobic because I don’t bind? 

I’d really like to be educated if what I’m doing is indeed hurtful"	"You have *absolutely* no obligation to change anything. If you're okay with your body as it is, I'm happy for you. That person has some bullshit he needs to work through. That's a him problem, not a you problem
As a trans woman, i myself have experienced something similar to this, but it was regarding not wanting bottom surgery. I feel the pain you felt, and i really mean that. It fucking sucks to have bad ppl in the community who arent accepting of other ppls choices, and it has made me question too. I say fuck them, and be who you want to be. Try to not let imposter syndrome get to you. And there is no ""right"" way to be a trans man or woman. Everybody has their own way of doing things, and thats a-okay.
He sounds like a Truscum. (Google the term if you are unfamiliar) 

I don’t bind often because 1. My chest is very small easily hid under basically any article of clothing 2. I have really bad back pain from a horse back riding accident so even two sizes up in binders gives me pain 

I do eventually want top surgery but it’s one of the last things I’m thinking about in medical journey.
Bro that dude does not know what fetishizing means lmao
You are absolutely not fetishizing. We don’t have to hate every part of our body to feel euphoric as the opposite gender to our agab 💜 im a trans man as well who doesn’t want top surgery either. I like being a fat man and I don’t mind having moobs LOL. That person sounds super gatekeepy.
I don't bind because I can't safely bind. I know guys who don't bind because they simply don't want to. While I want top surgery, I don't want bottom surgery. Doesn't make me any less of a man. Doesn't make you any less of a man either.
You’re trans. It’s your body and your choice. If someone is hurt by you simply existing they need professional help.
Binding (and top surgery) are not requirements for being trans. 

Most guys I know who have had top surgery didn’t bind 100% of the time prior to getting top surgery. I didn’t bind sometimes because it hurt and aggravated my chronic pain. I have a friend who feels his chest is just too big to bind easily and embraces them as being part of being a bigger guy and being his best bear self. I know a couple guys who don’t bind because of sensory issues. 

Be suspicious of other trans folks who act as gatekeepers of being trans. They are often very interested in excluding those with different experiences in the hopes of boosting themselves as the good, correct trans folks. 

In the US right now, I would consider many of them collaborators with those who are seeking to eradicate us.
You're not fetishizing.
That dude doesn’t know what a fetish is.
I don’t bind, I’m a man. Many trans men don’t bind. They’re men. Many also don’t care to get top surgery. He sounds like he’s projecting some internalized emotions.
Fellow guy here. I don't bind because it hurts me and even if I do have dysphoria, I'm not willing to hurt myself. People who act like you have to bind or do certain things are gatekeeping and it's uncalled for.
What you do with your own body is your business and your business alone. If you identify has a man, you are a man whether you bind or not. There are plenty of non transitioning trans women, and I'm sure there are tons of non transitioning trans men. Saying that your being transphobic because you don't bind is inherently a transphobic rhetoric because it invalidates all the non op trans men.
Trans man here! I rarely bind due to rib problems from a wreck, and if I do bind, it’s not a full bind. There’s plenty of people who aren’t interested in surgery either for multiple reasons. Doesn’t make them any less valid in their identity. I personally am on the fence with it because it’s terrifying and such a huge step. You don’t need to change because of one person saying something like that. You’re still valid. Ignore them.
fellow trans dude here. i bind most of the time because sometimes my chest dysphoria is pretty bad, but i can also go weeks without binding and “faulting them around” when i’m just wearing low cut shirts n whatnot. there’s no one way to be trans. however you want to define your trans journey is up to you. don’t listen to people who tell you otherwise
You are 100% valid as a transman, binding or not. People have reasons for the treatment they choose, and it doesn't mean they're fetishizing.
Gender is based off of a feeling there is no real world metric. Welcome brother
That’s some insane bullshit. Ignore it
Nah, he’s full of shit. Hating every bit of your body isn’t necessary to be trans. 

And some cis men have breasts, too. It’s called gynecomastia when it happens to AMAB people without deliberate estrogen supplementation. I have a coworker with gynecomastia who doesn’t make an effort to hide his chest, and if it doesn’t make him less of a man, it doesn’t make you less of a man either. 

I don’t bind often either, although I do want top surgery, because I have hypermobility and get rib pain faster than most, plus risk dislocating a shoulder trying to get a binder off if I’m not careful.
Just because you don't dislike a part of your body others sometimes do, doesnt mean your fetishizing
Is it right and just for trans people to have access to health care? Absolutely. 

Do our trans identities or existence depend on the medicalist and frankly much-too-comfortable-with-the-authorities framework that fetishizes being good little patients for the rubber stampers to validate? Fuck no. 

There is scary shit getting scarier out there and your friend is gonna have to grow up and learn that we have to love and protect each other without any question of gatekeeping or this weird picking at each other that happens before we realize/remember that the differences between us, even within this small community, are gifts and not weapons.
dude just sounds like a cruddy person tbh. here's the thing being trans doesn't mean you have to act a certain way or do a certain thing, its just you being your authentic self and dont let anyone convince you otherwise. Be yourself, however you want to be!
The answer to ""am i trans if i dont want to do x"" is always yes. Esecialy if x is somethi g from cis socity tjts is forced on us. 


Thats al u need to know,you decide your ge der end of diascution. U can feteshize ur gender but its still ur gender.
Ya don't need to bind. Some ppl need it and can. And others don't need it
I have two trans guy friends that are non-op guys and they’re super valid guys like you
No one has to completely transition to be trans, don't worry about what others think dude
It's your body bro, and your choice. That's not fetishizing. I'm a trans woman, and I haven't even started hormones, let alone talked about bottom surgery yet.
holy shit you’re absolutely not fetishizing. i am so sorry that happened to you my friend, that guy SUCKS. being trans means you don’t fit into the rigid binary of only cis male only cis female. so why would you realize that and try and force yourself into another binary or medical transition or not? 

tldr: nothing is required to be trans, no surgery or hormones or name change, nothing. this person was very mean and rude and he does not represent the real genuine companionship of this community. from one trans guy who doesn’t bind (sensory issues for me) to another, you’re more than welcome here.
Hoo boy, that guy's gonna lose his mind when he meets someone nonbinary lol

It's 100% valid for anyone, binary or no to be comfortable with any part of their body! Only you can decide what's right for yourself, and considering the fact some people medically *can't* bind it's just foolish to act like not doing so is somehow an insult. He's insecure, and probably truscum.

(Just for the record, you're not alone either- I may not be an exactly binary trans man but I don't have any interest in a flat chest, and if that makes someone uncomfy they can stink themselves)
Wanting and not wanting surgeries does not make you trans. Whoever told you that is a jerk. You are valid even if you're comfortable in your skin. The fact that you even cried about says that you have no ill intentions.
Short answer: no. If you like your boobs, you like them. That's totally fine and valid. Cis people are also allowed to like parts of them, that aren't typical for their gender.
sounds like some ignorant truscum guy.
Even if you do this by choice, not everyone has the privilege to bind or get surgery, and not wanting to do it is equally valid.

Using the deaths of people to make you feel bad is insanely low and not true at all
I'm sorry he said that.
Of course you aren’t fetishising it! You’re just being yourself, and that’s what being trans is all about. Even other trans people hate us, I genuinely can’t stand people who think this way
Yeah that's 100% truscum talk. To be valid as trans you do not have to have any medical intervention or dress, act, or be a certain way. There are plenty of trans folks for whom this is the case and it does not affect how trans or valid they are. You do you!
i don’t bind and i never will. im trans masc/non-binary. i can dress and present however i want no one has the right to tell you you are being trans in the “wrong” way… there are Cis men who dress hyper feminine, there are Cis women who dress hypermasculine. clothing does not equal gender. and you don’t have to want surgery at all. you don’t have to take hormones. You being trans is about YOU, me being trans is about ME, it’s different for everyone.
I don't bind because my chest is so large. No binder I have tried has did anything. I'm also a femboy so I wear dresses alot and I'm in touch with my feminine character. 

I do want top surgery in the near future and I'm fighting to save for it. But hell, you don't have to change anything about yourself if you don't want/feel comfortable with it. I'm personally not getting bottom surgery and debating hormones.
No one can invent a moral system around your body. Your body your choice always, man or woman.
That is…. Fucked up. You’re under no obligation to want, let alone get, any kind of surgery. What about those that aren’t able to due to medical reasons? This person sounds like an ass. You do you bud
Trans men don’t owe people masculinity 
Trans women don’t owe people femininity 
Non binary people don’t owe people androgyny 

Screw that asshole. Do whatever makes ya happy
no one has to do anything to be considered trans except to realize they are trans. you literally don’t have to change anything. it’s nice to be able if you want to but yeah. i don’t bind at home unless i’m having a bad day with my body but tbh sounds like you’re talking with a jerk. transmed have no place here.
Okay, trans femme here but what you were told FUCKING SUCKS ASS as does the person who told you it. There are a variety of reasons not to bind. I wouldn't tell any woman that she's not a woman because she doesn't tuck either. A lot of trans people are fine with their bodies and don't want to change them... That's okay too. My co-worker, fellow trans femme, stopped HRT because it was having adverse effects on her.
there is no obligation for surgery. I didn't wear a bra or bind until I was 23 because of sensory issues+dysphoria making me uncomfortable wearing anything over my torso reminds me that something I don't want to exist is there. Been like this since puberty hehe. But that's a personal experience and literally every trans person goes through a different and unique experience. You aren't any less valid for not feeling the need.
Hell no I don't bind because of chronic pain and transitioning is for yourself if you decide one day you want yeet them teets vaild if you don't also vaild you transition is for you and if socially transitioning is all you want to do that's fine if you if you want to medically transition that's fine.
Each of us has a personal trip to take when we start off. It is most important that we are TRUE to ourselves. 

You need only worry about what is important to you. 

The rest of the world is not important...

This is what I learned about 25 years ago... 

Feel free to DM me if you want to talk about anything. 

Best Regards

Live your life the way you see fit. As a transfem who doesn't tuck, if anyone gives you shit about it, that's their problem, not yours.
I don't always bind, and I have severe chest dysphoria.  It's just not worth making my scoliosis and asymmetrical ribs worse, and I have an active full-time job that makes it laughable if I don't want to break my back.  There are all kinds of reasons why someone wouldn't bind; it's not a requirement at all.  What this guy said is ridiculous and that kind of truscum logic has hurt a lot of people.
nobody, and i mean nobody, should tell you how to transition. transitioning is an important part of being transgender and from getting surgery to just cutting hair is all transitioning things and are completely valid. you do what you find comfortable and proud in. NOBODY has the right to tell you what your identity is.
Everyone is valid. You owe nobody any explanation for who you are or for how you are trans. Medical or social or behavioral transition is something we do to help ourselves, not to help others.
you are just as valid as any guy who DOES want too surgery. i’ve also struggled w this as i don’t want bottom surgery, whoever said that doesn’t know wtf fetishizing means. sorry u had to deal w that.
What is disrespectful is telling someone else they’re doing their gender wrong.
Bro what the fuck?

As a trans guy who used to bind and has had top surgery, no you are not.

Don't associate with gatekeepers. They aren't good for you, me, or any other queer
I don’t bind because I can’t breathe.
You no obligation to conform to someone elses standards, you are you and only you are good at it so keep being you
you are trans. gender is flexible and a spectrum, that person is just an ass. as a trans man who wants top surgery and not bottom surgery, you’re 100% valid
ewww that guy is most definitely the problem not you. there isn’t only one way to be trans. don’t feel discouraged from being yourself
“You don’t want unnecessary surgery that costs thousands of dollars, AND you won’t do something that can harm you SIGNIFICANTLY? That means you’re not trans!”
I'm a trans woman, and I have numerous treason for not wanting any surgeries. What's more, there are trans people who can't get ANY gender care for one reason or another, and they're still trans.

You don't owe anybody a masculine presentation, and no one gets to tell you you're not valid for having differing goals from theirs. 🫂✊️🏳️‍⚧️
You are still trans. The only thing that means is you’re a non dysphoric trans person and instead base your indentity or the EUPHORIA that comes with transitioning. 

Omg I feel so professional after writing that
I mean, i identify as a trans woman, despite not hating my body. I just really really wish i had been born a girl to the point I'd gladly take a magic swap pill or whatever. I've considered transition many many times and still do frequently, but the benefit outweighs the problems that come with it (societal and safety) that i don't push myself too hard to. 

Everyone has their own way of expressing themselves and becoming comfortable in their body. You just need to make sure you do what is right for you! And don't let the rest of the world define who you are for you.
what the fuck?? you're valid as hell and that guy's insane. dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, binding isn't a requirement for being trans, top surgery isn't a requirement for being trans, there's no requirements other than just not being what you were assigned at birth. you don't need to make any physical changes to be valid. that's some transmed bs if i've ever heard it.
Nah you good bro, that dude is just a transmed 
You don’t have to bind or want to get any kind of surgeries/medication to be trans
If you know you’re a man, this guy as no business telling you you’re not lol
> I cried for one hour after

Bro... You are trans. Fuck this  stupid asshole. It is proof trans people are just humans and can be fucking assholes as well.
Sweetheart you are 100% not doing anything wrong, you don't have to bind or hate yourself/body just because you are trans. Liking parts of your body enough to where you don't feel like you have to hide those parts is something beautiful. You are valid in your journey and in life and I hope you forever see that. 💕
Dude ur just existing how you want to exist, you are doing absolutely nothing harmful, and I’m sorry that person made you think you were 

You do not have to bind to be valid as a transman. if you feel you’re a man, then you’re a man, you don’t have to express it how others want you to and if you feel comfortable with your body currently that’s 100% valid. The only one who dictates if ur a transman is you, you know yourself better than anyone else <3
Fuck that dude. Fuck trans medicalists. Your experience is yours and it does nothing to detract from, or even speak to, the experience of others.

What happened here had nothing to do with you. What happened was transphobes attacked this guy or people he cared about, and he blames your existence for that. That was the transphobes problem, not yours. You have nothing to be ashamed of for being yourself.
First, you are under no obligation to want/get top surgery or bind if you don’t want it. I can somewhat understand the idea of concern of the claim that what you were doing was ‘mocking those who have killed themselves’, however you being yourself and being happy is not a mockery of anyone whatsoever. The trans guy you were talking to is probably a truscum with a good amount of internalized transphobia and seems to be too illiterate to know what the word ‘fetish’ means.
 Ignore him and keep being yourself < 3
so ik this is different but kinda similar. i am a trans mtf but i hate long hair but i really like the buzzcut look and idk if thats ok or not.
FIRST THING, you are a human being NOT an f'n fetish. IF you decide to go forward with mtf transition it is ultimately your decision and your s only though you WILL find genuine support.  I don't know every thing, but I a sub male reached the best mtf for me only to find out I have problem that I have deal with first.
i used to be unable to bind for longer than 4 hours due to health issues and while i did have top surgery eventually, i didn’t have much of a choice with binding. there are numerous reasons people may choose not to bind and you’re not fetishizing trans people for that. it doesn’t matter whether or not you get top surgery either, you’re still not fetishizing being trans
Sounds like someone got dysphoric and projected it onto you. Your wants and needs are based on YOU, not some other trans guy.
Sweets, I recently came out at the beginning of the year. I have been struggling with the concept of transitioning medically. I am still valid as I am, and so are you. You don't owe anything to anyone.
listen if your chest don’t make you feel like shit, i see no fucking reason why this is a bad thing. 
I see no reason why every trans person must go through brutal dysphoria and pain just to be considered trans. This isn’t a competition, this isn’t some stupid trauma race, gender isn’t based on how much you hate your body. 

Even if you were walking around with only a bikini on, you’re still as much of a man as the guy with twenty layers on.
Hi! Gender, women, and sexuality studies major here! :)

What the guy you met was alluding to is the concept of transmedicalism. Basically transmedicalism is this (bullsh*t) idea that a trans person has to medically transition or at the very least experience severe dissatifaction/gender dysphoria regarding their physical appearance to be truly trans.

Truth is, you are completely valid as a trans man regardless of it you bind, take testosterone, get top or bottom surgery, etc. Being a man is about who you are internally and has nothing to do with your outward appearance/ gender presentation. Yes, a lot of people find it comforting to present in traditionally masculine ways (like binding to have a flat chest), but you aren't *less* trans than them for not doing so.  

Much love <3
Some people get so tied up in their own expectations that they forget that the whole point is that you’re working through your own dysphoria. You do you, and fuck what anyone else thinks. 

Besides, plenty of normal straight cis dudes have tits that make me, a middle aged trans woman, jealous. Looking at you, Pedro the painter at the last job site I worked.
You're never obligated to do something you don't want to do. If you're totally fine with your parts and aren't interested in changing them, that's completely valid!! You're not hurting anyone by doing so. That person was just being stupid. It's YOUR body, do whatever you want with it
Sounds like a bloody exclu, transmed, or some bullcrap like that. Don't listen to that old world rhetoric. It's crap. You're valid just as you are. You don't need to have any procedures or anything to prove you're ""trans enough."" It's valid if you say you're trans, PERIOD! That's all there is to it. Make the changes that suit you, and leave the rest. You're still valid, just as you are.
That person is a piece of gatekeeping trash. You do what feels comfortable to you.
Fellow non binding trans man here …. You don’t have to bind! In fact, binding is harmful to your body if done wrong (and even when done right!) If you don’t like binding, then you don’t need to bind. Simple as that! And if you have no interest in top surgery, that’s your choice, too! Your body, your gender, your rules. No one else, cis or trans, gets to dictate that for you. EVER. 

I’ve been out for around fifteen years now and I’ve run into my fair share of trans policing, even by other trans folks. The thing you have to remind yourself about these toxic notions is … they’re probably coming from that person’s own insecurities and projections. Don’t take on their trauma for them.
Trans woman here. I thought for the longest that I couldn't be valid because I didn't violently hate my bottom bits. What I've been learning from lurking here is that the spectrum of experience is broad. There are trans people with all sorts of things they like and dislike. The whole point is to be someone you can be comfortable as, whatever that means to you.
Just wondering what binding is?
What you do with your own body, how you feel and express your gender is your business. Nothing about being a man requires your breast tissue to vanish.

Sorry they were shitty to you :(
This is so unbelievably ridiculous; the other guy and his accusations, not you. Trans people are not a monolith and everyone's transitions are not going to be the same. For me, I've been on T, got top surgery, and want to get a hysterectomy, for one of my friends he wants to start T but in general doesn't mind his breasts at all and at most would get a reduction surgery instead of having them removed completely and doesn't want any other surgery. This kind of 'if you don't do xyz you're not trans you're just faking it' is gatekeepy and disgusting and in this day and age where trans people are being attacked on all fronts the last thing we need is infighting further tearing the community apart. You keep being you, don't let anyone put you down for living your best life.
Yea, echoing other commenters by saying don’t listen to him. I’m trans masc and have little to no dysphoria regarding my breasts. I don’t want too surgery at this moment in my life. You are still valid in your trans masculinity. No one cis or trans can tell you what makes you more or less trans. People (in general) need to stop commenting and casting judgment on other people’s bodies.
Fuck gatekeepers. 

What you binding or not binding means to you, your gender and your gender expression can only be contextualized by you and you alone and ideally shouldn't matter to anyone other than you.

As far as fetishizing, that only works if one choses to exclusively contextualize breasts as sexual, right?
I find the idea of possessing a body part being a kink to be a bit of a hard sell, but anythings possible.
 
I think your friends reaction was a bit irrational though, seeing you with breast shouldn't make them so irate.

I feel you should wear your body how you're comfortable. your chest is an unlikely factor in anyone ending them self and that leap in logic is something I'd be weary about.
You are not fetishizing at all, you don’t have to be dysphoric about certain parts of your body or want to change/hide certain parts of your body to be valid. There are plenty of trans people who do not want to bind or get top surgery, or bottom surgery or even go on hormones and that does not make them or you any less valid! You do what makes you feel most comfortable and happy 💖
I am SO sorry that is NOT ok. Fetishizing is a whole other thing from being your trans self in the way that works for you. Some trans people think you HAVE to have terrible dysphoria in order to be trans and that just isn’t true. It’s a pathology of transness similar to how autistic people go undiagnosed because people think that only *sterotypical* autism is indicative of being autistic when the reality is a lot of the “symptoms” of autism are just observable distress behaviors of autistic people and there are, in fact, autistics who grow up in situations where they don’t feel distressed often enough to be diagnosed that way. Same goes for being trans. Just because it’s been medicalized that you “have” to change your body to be a certain gender that absolutely isn’t true, and it certainly isn’t the only way to be trans. Maybe you’ll find you do want to change things, but if you don’t that doesn’t make you a fetishist. Your are enough as you are, and you are trans enough.
Dude your body is your body. I've met guys who hate their boobs and guys who don't mind them. Both are valid, just like you
You are the only one who knows what gender you are. If you're okay with your body as it is, more power to you. I have 0% interest in bottom surgery. I have a friend is considering lasering his face because he hates facial hair.   


I will say I am a bit envious you don't feel you need to. I have whole days where things are ruined if I feel ""too booby"".   


I wish you luck in your journey and if you want someone to talk to I sometimes respond.
Nah dude, you're not fetishizing it. That guy was just kind of a Dick.
not binding does absolutely not mean you aren’t trans. people who say you have to bind or want top surgery to be trans are gatekeeping assholes, just like that other trans man that sparked this post. sure, most prefer to bind, but again, binding is not a required part of being trans. you’re valid as all hell, they are an asshole.
I'm sorry you got that.

Surgery is not required to be trans.
Other's dysphoria is not and cannot be your fault.
Binding can have risks and is not for everyone. 
You are a valid man.
You are a valid trans man.

And trans folk are also allowed to have kinks and fetishes and that's our business.

If you were trying to convince another trans man to keep breasts because you thought they were sexy on him, then that might be problematic. Otherwise dude, your body is your business.
What they said is stupid because . . . .

1. You can be trans and be afraid to go under the knife or not want surgery for any number of reasons. Some people also just are fine with their bodies and just want to be identified as they ask to. Pleeeenty of CIS-men have breasts.
2. Binding is uncomfortable and unhealthy. IF you're comfortable with how you look, why bother with it to please someone else?
3.  Trans people are at all different places in their journey. You may not ever want it or someday you may want it down the line. They don't get to tell you. Whether they think you're one of them or not you're supporting the movement.

&#x200B;

That said, I don't believe this is you but . . . Trans-TRENDERS are a thing and I understand how they do irk people. I know a specific person in my life who I am NOT friends with who inserts themselves in everything LGBTQIA+ and will interrupt anyone to tell their story or some experience that probably didn't happen.

and they're FTM yet they're squeezing their hairy boobs up to their collarbone wearing cleavage-filled dresses and necklaces that say  "" MOMMY "" like some parody. Like if you're FTM why are you still . . . . wearing stuff that says BabyGirl and Mommy and skirts and having your breasts out? They do it to an extremity hoping to push someone's buttons so they can post about the person who rolled their eyes at them that day.

Maybe that asshole you encountered has had someone in their life like that and unfortunately lumped you in with them undeservingly.
They are man with boobs... so who cares, just do what you feel right to you, if you dont want surgery for wherever reason that don't make you more or less a man than the others.
Binding is less about being trans and more about feeling gender dysphoria and gender euphoria. Some trans peeps have extreme GD while some have none. Some peeps feel a lot of GE where some feel very little. It’s usually easier to say if you’re trans based on GE rather than GD since that’s more consistent between almost all trans peeps. So basically, you do what makes you feel good and ask near and dear ones to help with making you feel good (with pronouns and similar). 
I don’t know how to explain this in a good way but I can give my experience as an example. For me, binding, posture and not l looking too closely at my body when looking in a mirror or showering is about GD. Dressing up and hairstyles are about GE. Pronouns and names are about both GD and GE combined. 
I hope this helped at least a little and wasn’t too confusing :)
Also, trans is the “condition” where as GD and GE are the symptoms and in the case of trans we can’t really treat the “condition” so we treat the symptoms instead.
You are valid! you’re still trans if you don’t bind and you’re still trans if you don’t want surgery, think of those who were trans before surgery was a possibility, they were valid without it and so are you! plus some people can’t bind or get surgery due to medical reasons (myself included), we are all valid, you are trans.
Who are they to tell you how to be you?
First of all:
This isn't anything near a fetish.
A fetish for trans* people would be if you want to date trans* people for their bodies. (Most of them ask for trans* people without surgeries) Or if you feel sexually aroused by calling yourself trans* or anything like that.


Second:
A lot of trans* people don't bind due to health problems or simply the fact they don't want or feel the need to. Binding is something that can help you get a nearly flat chest but it's also very dangerous if you do it wrong or if you already have problems with your back / lungs. So not binding is totally okay as long as you feel good.

Third:
Surgeries are also a dangerous thing. Even if you have a surgeon who is very experienced in what he does. Some people are simply too scared to risk anything and / or don't care about the parts of their body others would call ""female"" / ""male"" because they simply don't feel body dysphoria (towards some or all parts) of their body. Getting surgeries for those parts to make them look (more) like the usual appearance would only be an unnecessary thing and mostly so other people would ""believe"" they are trans* or call them by the right pronouns just by looking at their body. Since surgeries for trans* people are rather needed for your mental health than anything else: as long as you don't feel any dysphoria against your body, there is no need for anything dangerous like that.

Fourth:
You may have heard that a lot of trans* people do not go through every surgery. For example: A lot of trans* men only do top surgery (and remove inner organs). And I even heard from a lot of trans* women that they do not want bottom surgery and are completely fine with the breasts they got with hormones so they didn't had the need for such surgeries. Why should it be any different for you not wanting top surgery?
What makes you valid is your gender dysphoria towards the gender that was assigned at birth. Not your body dysphoria. Not people who tell you what you are or what you need to go through. Go your way. As long as you're fine with yourself you don't need to fear about fitting in or not. Being trans* isn't a thing of ""everyone needs to go though this and that to be trans*"". It's about finding a way to love yourself and finally feeling like yourself and not playing a role or hiding behind a masquerade anymore.
I really appreciate this💗💗💗 that experience is something that has been keeping me up at night thank you so much for this🌺💖💗
#nobottomsurgerylife!
Tysm i needed this so much
At all. Seems like he was weaponizing non-applicable terms to justify his internalized transphobia.
THIS. my boyfriend is a trans guy who doesnt want to do hrt or get any surgery
Thank you for this🙏🙏🙏🙏 I truly thought I was being disrespectful 💕🌺💝 after hearing this I feel like a huge Weight has just been lifted off my shoulders
Exactly this.
Also these are the same people complaining about """"""transtrenders"""""" hogging their precious resources, which is already a ridiculous statement, BUT it makes absolutely no sense that they're gonna bitch about that and *then* be all like HOW **DARE** YOU NOT WANT SURGERY?!!!
It’s 100% perfectly ok
If it helps, I also don't bind. Choosing not to is completely valid and not something to make a big deal over.
♡♡♡♡♡ You've got this, and don't let truscum keep you from being yourself. ♡♡♡♡♡♡
I’m transmasc non-binary and something of a femby. I like my boobs. I just don’t want them to determine my gender. What I’m trying to say is you’re valid king.
Not to put any hate on bottom surgery, it just isnt for this girl 🤷‍♀️

Lucky you! An ally ánd a personal shopper, plus she has style too as you look great in this outfit. You hit the jackpot, girl!

how do I buy female clothes as a dude?	"I am physically a male and have been questioning my gender, I think it might help to try on some clothes. How do I get female clothes without looking weird? I'm 16 btw

Edit: thank you so much for your suggestions and support everyone it really means alot to me:) Now I just gotta find out what kinda outfits to buy:)"	"Walk in there and buy them. If someone tries to talk back, roll over them. They aren't women's clothes, they're your clothes, and you're buying them.

In more practical advice if you're genuinely worried, get a friend to take your measurements and use that knowledge to buy online.
No one is going to think you're weird. Most people will assume you're buying them as a present for a Gf or sister and if anyone asks that's what you can say
Honestly, clothes are clothes. You may get some looks shopping for undergarments, (as I have) but tbh, none of it really matters in the grand scheme of things. Other peoples thoughts shouldn't prevent you from being happy and feeling like yourself. 

I will say though, the first few times are really anxiety filled, until you get used to it. I used to think *everyone* was analyzing what I was doing, but in reality, all you are is a secondary character in thier life, and 99% dont even notice. After a few trips you will get more comfortable, so just give it some time and eventually it will just come naturally. 

Best of luck! 💜
I used amazon discreet shipping for years
I pretend I'm getting them for my nonexistent girlfriend lol
retail workers are not paid enough to give a shit
Just don't be weird about it. It's not weird. It's just shopping. Be confident, walk in like you belong there. If you get any weirdness at one store, just move on to the next. Like if you get bucked off a horse, you're supposed to get right back on it. I've had super positive experiences at Target, Kohl's and thrift/secondhand stores like Savers. Most people literally DGAF and aren't even paying attention to you.
Well, I'll tell you what *not* to do: Don't go in there loudly saying to whoever walks by ""Girlfriends, bro, amirite"" until you slowly just say bro every other word while fake laughing as loud and deep as you can. 

..not that I'm speaking from experience, nope, what makes you think that? Shhh. 🤫
I’m not embarrassed to buy girl clothes but I know that it can embarrass some of the women in the department so a couple of things I do is go when they are slow also if possible take a friend who is female till you feel more comfortable
Just go and buy it, thats all just whatever you do dont try to over think it. Most of the time theres no talking about the clothes at all. Or the cashier may comment on how cute they are which has happened to me. That gives me the courage to talk and i say “thank you i tried my best”. She then asked me if it was for someone else or myself i say myself and i get told i have great taste in clothing. Sorry lol went off on a little bit of personal experience 😆. Point is just go in and be yourself it might feel scary but you do it once then the next few times itll be much easier. Youll be fine
In a store
This remind me so much of myself. The first time i tried to buy boxers i almost cried bc i was so scared someone would see me. In reality nobody gives a fuck. Most people could care less about how you dress or what you buy.
I’d just slip in a little “oh man my gf needs to do her own shopping” as you check out or something like that
Goodwill no one cares.  I tried buying clothes at Burlington coat factory first, but that was a waste.

Goodwill allowed me to try things on and hone my style in a way another store would not.
Just go to a store and buy them. If you want you could buy a gift bag and card with time to make it look like their for someone else if you really wanna be discrete, but just let it be assumed that no one’s judging you. Or you could take measurements and buy online or something. There’s usually returns on stuff so you could just try it on at home
Stick towards stores geared toward younger people like Forever 21 and H&M. I'm 23 and still look pretty manly and no one ever really pays me any attention when I'm in the women's clothing section. If you ever feel unsafe, let an employee know immediately or leave. Those stores seem to be the safest in my experience.
For me it's so unimportant what gender you have when shopping girls clothes. But if someone is asking you could mention that you are buying stuff for your friend/girlfriend/sister. And in general did you noticed how many different people shop in the girls/woman section, you are not going to stand out
Iv been on hrt for about seven months now, and bought my first feminine clothing items….maybe 10 months ago. I STILL look like a dude in my day to day life. I just don’t care. If a stranger decides to harass you for looking in the womens clothes section…..just ask to see their gender police badge. I have had that in my chamber for a long time now…and still haven’t gotten to use it. Because no one is going to bother you. If anyone thinks anything weird about it then they are 99% of the time going to give you a strange look and then go about their business. Most people aren’t the gender police, and don’t want a confrontation over something they are confused about. Buy your clothes. Even go to the changing room to try them on. No one is going to say anything….and if they do then just tell them you are trans and it doesn’t matter what you look like, they are wrong if they argue against you. It’s not illegal, no one can stop you, and anyone that says anything to you isn’t worth a second of your time to worry about. Be you girl, fuck the people that take issue with that
Hey I was in this position at one point too! What helped me get up the courage to walk in there was finding a trusted friend to cone with me. Also going into big stores on quiet days can sometimes help since it's easier to find quiet corners if you're worried about prying eyes. Either way, know you have every right to be there and screw anyone who says otherwise :)
Say it's for your sister

If you need sizing idk how to help my mom buys my clothes
Nobody will question it if you're buying any but if you're really worried about it you can buy online!
Online Walmart Amazon
You can buy them online if you're worried about being seen. Otherwise in person you can just walk into the women's section, and if you're questioned you can say you're getting stuff for your sister or something. Nobody will really pay you any mind though.
If you can do it I recommend curbside/in store pickup.  The quality of clothing is still better, or at least more easily better quality than Amazon.  Figuring out size is critical,  charts online have gotten much better,  invest in a cheap cloth tape measure if you need to.
From my experience I have never had trouble buying girls clothes Most people just look the other way. But I can see how it can be scary to try and buy girl clothes for the first time.
I told myself “They are there to make money. That’s their job. They are only there to make money.” And it really helped repeating that mantra any time I went shopping pre transition. 

Also being 26 at the time really helped me trust that people just don’t care that much about random strangers. You aren’t the first “guy to come in” in their eyes and you won’t be the last, and you definitely aren’t the most memorable either. They aren’t telling stories about you and they aren’t remembering you at the end of the day. 

Just try to stay calm and relax, take your time and find things that make you happy instead of rushing in and out. I’m proud of you and I believe you can do it!
Op shopping / thrift shopping - nobody cares what you buy! And guess what - you can even try stuff on in the store, because there's often nobody checking what you take into the change rooms!

If you get self conscious, take a few male items in with you too - people will see what they want to see, and will assume you're only trying on the male items. 

If you're super self conscious, put on a grumpy face and pretend like you've been dragged through the women's section,  or have been sent looking for something for your significant other!
""How do I buy female clothes as a dude?""

Like stealing, the act of buying cross-sex clothes without drawing attention is a simple matter of being cool. There's nothing illegal or malicious about what you're doing, so just remain calm and go about your business. If someone approaches you (unlikely) just say you're buying for your sister/gf.
Something I haven't seen here yet, but which I did: Just try on clothes in the shop at first, that'll give you a feel for what you want! You can always buy them when you've worked up the courage later.

(Also, to reiterate what the other people are saying: Literally no one there will care. Of all the times I went shopping for fem clothes, only a single time did someone even look at me weirdly)
First, buy a measuring tape from the sowing section of Walmart, target, hobby lobby,...
Go to any clothing website, learn how to get your measurements to find out what size you are.
Go shopping! I started at big chain stores like Walmart and target. There are so many other people shopping in there, nobody cares. Eventually you will go to other stores and won't care who is there.
Not trans but an ally, have a friend who is MTF, and they just walked into a store, and browsed and bought what they liked with confidence. They said that looking like they belonged helped with people not paying them any heed.

They also told me thay when asked, they explained what they were doing, and what they were after to the store clerk in a cinfident tone, and she helped her with no judgement.
It is incredible how little retail workers actually give a shit. I promise you, you are the person in the store who cares the most about you being there <3
Walk into a women’s clothes store and buy some clothes. For the most part people really don’t care and in this instance I mean that in the most positive way possible. To the people working at the store you are just customer # it doesn’t matter and all they want to do is make the sale or try and get through the day like everyone else

If someone working at a store even bothers to give you more of a response than what they are programmed to do (like say hello or welcome and give a polite nod or smile) it is more likely to be out of a genuine desire to help than it is to be mean because as i stated before most people just want to get through the work day and back to their lives and the people that pay more attention is because they are passionate about their work and want to help

The worst possible part of buying anything for yourself in a store that could possibly be considered odd or out of the norm is other customers because they have the free time to judge but even in that instance the worst you could possibly get are some judge-y looks because you’re in a business and likely they don’t want to be kicked out for actually saying anything, but again 90% of the time people just don’t care and are more consumed with their own business there than to mess with you
order clothes online! that was my way around it. I had the same worry, but ordering clothes online made it easier
If anyone questions it and you aren’t happy saying they’re for yourself, you can always just say they’re a gift for someone.
I buy “mens” clothes as a biological female all the time, just as my biological male friends buy “womens” clothes all the time. People have all kinds of reasons whether they’re wearing the clothes themselves or getting them for someone else. People don’t really ask questions because of that. If they do then you can tell them the truth or lie. It’s so common for people to buy their friends, family, partners, etc. clothing that it wouldn’t look weird at all to anyone. It’s likely no one would even notice. I worked at a retail store and I would have men buy womens lingerie and robes and dresses and all kinds of stuff and I would just assume it was for someone else. It wouldn’t bother me if it was for them, but just societal norms tell you it’s for someone else. No one would likely notice or care
it's okay to feel nervous about it. physically most folks assume I'm a woman, and i felt nervous shopping in the men's section for the first time, even as an adult. it can feel like everyone's staring at you lol but i promise they are not. no one is that invested in what other folks are doing in public. no one will think twice about seeing you shop for feminine clothes. if anything they'll assume it's a gift.

some advice - women's sizes can be strange and differ dramatically from brand to brand. i recommend taking some measurements before you go so you have an idea of what to look for. good luck!
Some stores let you try clothes on without having to go up to a worker to unlock the room first. Try to find those. Typically in big clothing department stores in malls like JCPenny are like that.
All kinds of ways, I’m person self check out is the absolutely the best having some girl friends to go is always good . On line from all different places it’s quite easy, if you have to new trail and error to figure out your sizes then start with very inexpensive things. Or hopefully you have someone that can help you with measurements. Best of luck to you best wishes!
Yes!! Same! Like what are the sizes and how are they like guys sizes? I'm a size 32 in men's jeans so what size jeans would that be in women's?
I can figure out shirts pretty easily and I don't wear underwear unless I'm just taking pictures and being cute. Message me if you can help! 🏳️‍⚧️
Try thrift stores! There’s a large variety of options and things are cheaper, so if something doesn’t fit or isn’t to your liking you’re not throwing away too much money.
Have fun with it and don’t limit yourself!! If you look at it and like it, regardless of what you might feel about how it will look on you, try it on!
It may surprise you…
If you have a supportive friend go with them. The advice of other fems has always helped me, especially when I first began trying new things on that weren’t as masculine as what I was used to wearing. It’s also nice to have someone there to lean on.
And I think you’ll also find that people won’t mind or notice as much as you think they will.     Best of luck 💚
It’s nerve racking at first but I found if you have your phone out and look like your trying to find something off a list nobody pays attention
What size do you need?
Most people that work in clothing stores would be quite happy to help you.
Pretend you’re buying them for your girlfriend
When I first started my transition, I went to stores that were open late so I could shop in privacy and without any questioning eyes. Meijer, Wal-Mart, Burlington, Target, are all open until 11pm and those were good places to start feeling comfortable later on. Plus a lot of them have self checkout so you don't even have to deal with an associate if you don't want to.
I bring a female friend and make it look like it's theirs
Target. If anyone asks you’re buying your girlfriend clothes as a present.
I personally recommend resale shops, especially as being AMAB myself it’s basically the only way to reliably find skirts or tops that fit. I’ll occasionally have some older Karen stare or whisper to her husband but no one has said anything directly. (And I’m in a rural conservative area so that in itself is a bit surprising)
Just do Amazon
Just go into the store and shop, I do it all the time and no one ever questions me about it
when i first bought fem stuff, i was really scared, but no one really cared at all
As people have already been saying a lot in the comments, just walk in there and buy them. People are not entitled to know your deal or to judge you. However I'm honestly as scared at the prospect as you, so I've been buying gender affirming clothes online. If your country is similar to mine (the Netherlands) there are likely several affordable online stores. They usually package their things discreetly, you can change your personal details in their database if you want to, and you may even get them delivered to a pick up point if you're afraid of your parents getting involved.

Whichever way you go about it, continue interacting with people in the community and those who'll support you, it will not only make you feel heard, but help you explore your identy both consciously and subconsciously. Best of luck 🤟🖤
Yes,just go shop like anyone would. If you have a trusted someone, support is great too because friends are awesome. But otherwise, what's to stop you from going to have a look around? Maybe something just screams at you to TRY ME! Maybe on another trip that happens. But every human has a right to look at clothes right? It's a scary thing I imagine (I'm cis,but a mother that felt that scary thing with her daughter) but you can do it
Safest bet is to say you’re buying them for a friend/sibling or a significant other. Most likely people will not question you at all. I’d look for places where you don’t have to ask to use the dressing room.
Buying feminine clothes isn’t weird. Even if you appear masculine and buy feminine clothes, for all the people at the store know it could be a gift.
As hard as it is, the best tip is to just do it. When I first started, I got a lot of looks from everyone and I still do, the main question is just how fast you get used to it.

I do have 2 other tips!
1. Go shopping with a female friend. They'll be a lot more confident and you'll adapt that pretty quickly.
2. Go to a second hand shop.!!! Not only is it cheaper,  but the labels are mainly just guidelines.
For me personally I started with amazon. Trial and error back when I was pre everything. Best way. If thats not an option female friends. To help you look for clothing that fits you and your style without people passing judgement in stores
I used order clothes to my nearest Amazon locker when I lived with my family. You can find calculators online to figure out your sizes and the pickup is the definition of discreet
""It's for my twin sister's birthday :)""
Before I transitioned I was mega closeted and nobody would have ever known. I ordered from places online and also went to thrift shops for cheap. Nobody ever looked at me twice. I think one cashier said a dress was cute and I made some bs story about how my sister likes things that style and thifting lol.
Literally just buy anything and most people won't blink an eye, but if it makes you feel better you have the ""it's for my sister/girlfriend/mother excuse in your back pocket
I buy with click and collect if that’s available, or get them delivered somewhere safe if that’s possible. I’m guessing you’re still closeted like me, so if you click and collect under your real name it’ll raise less eyebrows.
1. Most people will not notice or care

2. If you think you're getting funny looks in the underwear sections, check your phone and look at the labels. People will assume you have instructions from someone else for what to get 

3. You can say it's for someone else (partner, sister) if you want.

4. Order online. Even if you pick up in store, no one is going to care because a lot of places have bagged the clothes and won't even know what you've got, and the bagger won't care either.
""Clothes are clothes"" and ""just do it"" are nice and helpfull advices but honesly what helped me thenmoat was going in there is a good girl friend and looking arround, i was hella nervous evan tho i was shure at that point i was trans, so it normal.
Getting a friend with you is helpfull and will give you the safety in numbers if you feel anxious.
Try the Thrift stores
I've bought most of mine online. Mostly because the variety online is vastly greater than what you can get around here. 

If you're going to do this, I recommend getting a measuring tape to figure out sizes in the beginning.
If you are too shy - you can always order it online
I was stressing about that early in my transition sometimes its best to just do it and the fear will go away after doing it but only do it when yoy ready its hard tho so I know how you must be feeling goodluck tho xx
Clothes are clothes, they don’t have a gender. Skirts, high heals, wigs, and make up were invented with being gender neutral in mind if that helps any 🤷‍♀️
I was a dude getting fitted at Victoria's secret lol just get over it its worth it
Easiest way get a female person with you and pretend the clothes are for her.  
Way two just pretend it's a gift for someone.  
Or just ignore the stares and comments from other people and be proud of yourself.  


You got this!
Nobody will even notice you. Take a friend, use your phone, pretend you're texting or talking on it, there's all sorts of ways. But honestly, no one will even notice you.
just do it
For me, online shopping mostly. I just finished spending $300
If you're self conscious you could buy online, or if you have a trusted female friend go with her so you are not alone feeling awkward. 
Clothes shopping can be overwhelming at first and do whatever makes you the most comfortable.
Buying them online is easiest.  Going with a female friend is another, though I would note that no one actually cares even slightly if you buy a dress and look like a guy.  You might see a bit of a friction in places with gendered dressing rooms, but, again, no one is going to care much if you try on women's clothing as a general case.
people will probably think ur buying them as a gift so don’t worry
No one will question it, you'd be surprised. If you just walk in, pick out some items, go into the change room to try them on, and pay for them and leave they won't even think about it. People mostly mind their own business, especially when it comes to shopping.
Ahh… to be young and actually give a fuck. Lol. 

When I was first starting out, the story I always kept in my back pocket was that my girlfriend was paralyzed in a terrible accident and while she was healing well (she’s such a trooper), she was still very self conscious about going out in public in her wheelchair. I figured that a story like that would pretty much shut down any more questions about why I’m buying women’s clothes. I never got the chance to use that story… mostly because nobody cares.
I’ve never had to say it, because I’ve found nobody actually cares, BUT if anybody did say anything my excuse in my head is “The clothes are more interesting in the womens section”. At the end of the day it’s just fabric.
It’s going to be suspect but a good place to start is measuring yourself. Know what kind of appearance you’re going for and get as close to the right size as you can
You can buy online if that makes you more comfortable!
Buy em as a gift?
Honestly no one will say anything and if they do, say you’re buying clothes for your girlfriend or sister.
Cash or credit.
If anyone asks id just say either it is 1: for a prank/ joke you and your friends are pulling or 2: you are getting them as a present for your sister/mom/gf
Edit: that is if you aren’t comfortable saying they are for you
Amazon.  Use prime and send to a pickup locker if there’s one near you.
Would definitely just go in, find the clothes you like, TRY THEM ON, pay  and leave 😊 

I'm emphasising try them on, otherwise you will for sure spend money on something that doesn't fit you as you would like to
The internet is on you're side Sista
Before answering, there’s multiple things you need to consider:
1. How much are you willing to spend?
2. Do you want your parents to find out?
3. How comfortable are you buying clothes in public?

My top recommendation is going thrifting with some friends who you’re comfortable coming out to, preferably people in the lgbtq+ community. Thrift stores are always a good place for clothes, but especially fun for people experimenting! It’s cheap andyou can try on lots of stuff.

If you don’t want to shop physically, and are comfortable with risking needing to come out to your parents, then I suggest shopping online. I don’t like to recommend Shein to people due to their unethical business practices, but it’s cheap and looks good.

If you’re not ready to tell your parents and you don’t want to shop physically, shop online but ship it to a trusted friends house instead of your own.

Another option is to search for closets where you live. Closets are small sections for trans people typically found in boutiques where you can donate and recieve clothes for free! It’s completely judgement free, but might be hard to find and the rules might differ depending in where you live.

Lastly, although I don’t recommend it, if you’re out to any women you can ask if they have any old clothes they might want to donate. These clothes will typically not fit well, and more importantly, it’s a bit of an uncomfortable question to ask. If they offer though, take them up on it!

Hope this helps, good luck on your journey to finding yourself❤️
Amazon is a friend,  or just go to Walmart in the middle of the night if you're that worried, trust me they have seen it all and a guy buying a bra at 2 am will not even register to them. When I first started I did this and had some of the girls suggesting things they were super nice.
My tip for buying something that you might feel weird about is also buying a birthday card with it. The cashier is most likely not going to care at all, but if it makes you feel better, then who cares? Do what you need to feel comfortable in your body and within the communities you are in
If your not confident enough with yourself that's also fine, I personally buy my clothes online❣️
I got mine first by online ordering. Used some online calculators to compare male sizes to female sizes and then try and error
Saying go and buy it is all well and good and if you can do that, good for you, you should absolutely do that. That said, if you’re uncomfortable with the idea of going to a store to the women’s section, online purchases are always a good idea
When I used to look fully masc and would shop for women's clothes, I would always just walk in and do it really confidently and just tell myself ""if anyone is noticing me, they probably just assume I'm shopping for someone else."" No idea how likely it is people were thinking that but telling myself that helped me do it more comfortably.
I totally get the fear and anxiety. I found it to be so much easier when I had a set of feminine clothing to shop for more. Try to get your first pair from a friend or thrift stores or Amazon and then you'll feel more confident.

The other ideas are totally valid of just walking in and buying some. Thrift stores are really nice cuz it's a learning curve to figure out sizes and then to realize size doesn't tell ya crap cuz different brands use different sizing:/ 

Amazon with their size charts can help a lot so you get closer without having to spend too much energy
Hey! As someone who's been in a similar position to yours, I highly recommend before you go in, take your measurements and look up women's sizing charts (they also make men to women's sizing charts, but using your measurements and then comparing them to common women's sizing charts would probably work better). If you have a specific store in mind (such as old navy) see if you can find a store specific sizing chart. People probably won't give a shit if someone who looks like a guy is buying ladies clothes, and vice versa. If you have the confidence to go into a fitting room (which i highly recommend if you're able to), grab a few of the same article of clothing in different sizes and strut in confidently! You can say you have a twin sibling or cousin with similar measurements. Or even go with a friend so they can have your back during the process 

I'll add on if I can think of anything. Best wishes!
Yeah on the whole so long as you look confident in what your are doing other people will assume that your are confident in what you are doing
I had that same problem when I first started.. people didn’t mess with me but I just planned on telling them they were gifts for people ☺️
You buy them 🕺
Get a friend to buy them also would work. If you have any girl friends anyway
I’ve only had one person ever comment about my clothes buying and that was once when I bought a bra and the cashier asked if it was for my girlfriend and I just said “yep” and she thought it was a nice thing to do for her.
my advice would be to take it slow. start out androgynous and work your way up. also remember female clothing is made slightly different to men's so some may not fit, not to mention the sizing is weird af.
Amazon tbh....they also allow try-on periods where you can try before making a decision. You can also try shopping at clothing stores more distant from your home. if you're trying to avoid running into people you know.

I think this is only available in more developed areas so this might not be an option if you are in a small town.
Best advice I can give is to get a tailors measuring tape, go to an online clothes shop, finds the sizing table, take your measurements according to the provided guide and but your clothes online ☺️

Look up some tips on buying clothing for trans women. Not everything is going to fit you and not everything is going to look good on you. You will kinda have to try different styles. Good luck!
In the beginning, I felt the same way. If I thought I had to, I would mutter things like, ""I hope he likes this."" 

As I got older, and gain more confidence, I stopped caring. I hope you get to that day too! It's a load off your shoulders.
One thing I did when I was presenting male was browse the Women's section and find a few things.

Then I would take clothes over to the men's dressing room and try them on there.
Cis woman here I hate shopping in person so I buy online. I also live in small rural town. It is just so nice to try on and return if I don't like it.
Amazon prime is always my go-to, I am really too shy to go to a store and look so far. They are easy with returns if stuff doesnt fit, but girls posting thejr measurements and pictures in different sizes is a HUGE help, so that way I have never really had to return anything.
Seriously, the worry is all in your head. I don’t say that to be dismissive but genuinely people don’t care (source: I’m transfem I did it too) and on the off chance someone asks, say you’re buying them for your girlfriend or something. Don’t worry about changing rooms, take them home and if you don’t like them you can return them later :)
Amazon, or order them online
Simply just buy em! If anyone asks you could say it’s a gift. When i was pre-transition, n i was stood in the male section hovering around boxers and stuff, i got looks. And then after i was out and passed well as a male, i was in the bra section for my sister and i was getting looks. Its a lose-lose really, tbh though not many people will pay much attention, and if they do say its a gift or for your partner :)) good luck!!!
Say there for someone else or take someone with you
Just buy them, it will be scary at first but people care a lot less then u think
do it once and you well feel why didn’t I do it early. maybe buy something neutral like a tshirt or regular fit jeans. also pick something from men’s section. go to the trial room. try it. and then buy it. go home and be happy.  next time just get the cutest dress. online shopping works too but takes time to find the right fit and needs lot of returns. happy shopping
I was also nervous to buy my first dress or my first bra. Go with a friend and just laugh like you're buying the clothes for some school show. You'll get into it really fast and if the shop assistants are kind (as they SHOULD be), they'll help you find something that fits you well. 🥰🥰
If you were a single parent, how would you buy clothes for your daughter?. I am transgender and a single parent too, I ignore all of the negative comments and just get on with what I have to do. Make sure first though that you have all of the right sizes and requirements you need.
friends are great to have i did get some of my first clothes online. shein is cheap but their quality can be shit sometimes and you don't need to feel weird buying from them
If you’re worried about going through the register or bringing them home, fill up a trolley with all different styles of clothes and try them on in the changing rooms !
walk in and buy them i just went to a lingerie store in boy mode and no one batted an eye at me. also going with a friend helps.
Just walk in and buy it like you belong there And don't expect to have to explain yourself.

People will surprisingly care very little About what you buy if you aren't visibly nervous, Or assume you're buying it for a female friend.
I hope this helps. But you could also buy outfits that usually girls would buy like pink sweatshirts or sum. You could even put on some makeup like usually girls apply and make ur face look feminine like ur jaw and cheekbone also ur nosebridge. If you feel confident looking like a female then I'm happy for you!
Goodwill and other thrift places too because most of the time people won’t give ya a second look. But also, and this is hard, just not giving a fuck. I’ve had old people who work at stores try to tell me “the ladies section is over there.” And I just look at them and acknowledge them and keep shopping. People are gonna be weird and not get it but you gotta ignore em. Or online shopping/depop work too
Thrift stores and shein
""Doing Christmas shopping early this year""
Well, I was 16 a long time ago and things were different then. Today, as a grown ass woman, I just walk in all masculine like I know what I want and I buy it. Alternatively you could open up to a friend who is a girl and ask for her help.
I mean if you're asking for places to go I found that a store called Torrid is normally without exception very accepting of trans women and they deal in plus size clothing which I found to be very useful myself because when I tried to shop at other stores all the sizes were too small and it made me very very depressed. If you're looking for more of a hands-off approach though I would definitely suggest going with shein, I believe they have some kind of problematic policies but they do have a lot of xl sizes and stretchy clothes for really cheap as well which again was a problem I personally had. Hopefully this helps you out
Go to a thrift store they got clothes in there too
yous are so weird 🤣
Ah yes, the Eddie Izzard Principle
This, or walk in there pretending be in a rush on the phone with your “girlfriend” trying to find the clothes she needs so urgently.
I went into tesco in Ireland in my home town and just picked up some nylon thigh high stockings, some satin thongs and some lace thongs. I used the self checkout and just went about my business. 
How are they to know who they are for. 

In terms of size, my wife is the same height as me so her UK/IRL size 10 panties fit me perfectly. Her skirts and pants are the right size. 

Find someone in your family or friends who are roughly your size and shape and try on their things. PM me if you want anymore advice or tips and tricks 😉
Thank you!
In probably just overthinking it thanks:)
Exactly. You might feel hella nervuous but seriously the irony of transphobia and gendered clothing is that the last thing people will think is that they are for you.

Also consider yourself lucky, now days you can buy plenty online too
Exactly what I was going to say. No one is overly analyzing it, and if they are, they most likely would come up with a ""socially acceptable"" explanation.
This is what I did when Amazon still only sold books
Yeah undergarments used to worry me. 

Now I walk into lingerie shops in male mode and start browsing. I’ve never tried anything on in store (pretty clued up on sizing) but when the shop assistant comes round I’ve often asked if some things are out of stock or I’m looking for such and such in a particular colour. One time they asked if I’m shopping for my gf and I said no, myself. There was no alarm, no security escorted me off the premises, no end of the world stuff. She just went accepted it and carried on trying to recommend and sell me items. 

Now I love shopping for lingerie and feminine clothes (NOT female clothes…. Feminine clothes)
Thank you so much:) this helps alot
second amazon, still early but I am not going out.  It one thing to say 'yea just go buy clothes' it an other for a 28 y/o amab to just go get all sorts of girl clothes.  Also becuase sizing.  You'll want to know it.

Actually first thing is tailoring measurement ruler to get good measurements.
How does that work?
I still get nervous and uncomfortable buying clothes in person at times. I bought a body measuring tape and order online. Once you have ordered a few times you get to know your sizes easier. 

I also have a couple girl friends who are around the same size as me so they go shopping with me and try things on for me and send photos to see how it looks on a person. I got lucky with that one.
Same here, I tell them it's for my gf
Goodwill is pro transgender and celibate pride month
So I was a 33 waist in mens, initially I was between an 8-10 in woman’s if there was stretch, or a 12-14 if there was no stretch. So a woman’s medium or large.
I would love to feel confident as a female that is why I want to get the clothes:)
I wish I had a friend that was a girl this would be much easier
Who is a trans woman too! Just sharing, in case anyone didn't know she came out.
""Running, jumping, climbing trees-- putting on make-up while you're up there. An Action Transvestite.""
 Don’t do the phone trick no one believes it jsut go in their casually and buy some clothes if anyone asked you cns jsut say their for a girl you know 

You aren’t lieing are you


Wel maybe if we get into the existential ideas of like do I know myself
I do that when I get makeup at shoppers. I look as masculine as possible, pretend to be exasperated on the phone with my gf (who doesn't exist) and shop for whatever I want 😁
It's okay to feel nervous about it, it's a new thing to do. But really most people aren't even going to bat an eye at it. Just go in and buy it like you would any other clothes and if anyone does ask just either tell them to mind their business who just say it's for a friend. I'm a guy and I buy my friends girly clothes all the time :3 

It takes time but eventually, you won't even think twice about it
You'll be fine! Good luck!
I was terrified when I first bought some stuff at target and to be honest I still am a little scared and im 24. Its normal, but in all the times ive bought things that are womens while presenting as a cis male no one has even given me a second look. Its normal to be anxious about it but literally no one cares or even looks at what you are buying
You'll only run into any drama if you insist on using women's dressing rooms. Otherwise, most people don't care what you buy. At worst, the clerk might ask about a girlfriend.
Yeah I did then same, at about your age and when I was at the register after I akwardly hung around Primark with my headphones on, the lady at the register just brightly kept giving me advice, because she assumed I was buying for my gf.
Oh oh! Go to La Senza! (If you have it in your area) they literally have a booklet to convert for mens sizes (which they deem sister sizing), and they are trained to work for picking stuff out for males. 

The one I went to one, I was so nervous, but wanted a nice bra (I *highly HIGHLY* suggest taking a look at the Hello Sugar bras). One of the assistants came over to me and asked if I needed a hand, told them what I was looking for (a 40A, probably tipped them off) and they picked out a bunch, and let me go into the back to try them on. (Granted most smaller sizes dont go over 36/38, so I had to get an extender, which is also a blessing, as now I can wear all my bras comfortably (even the shoddy walmart ones)).

They were *super* impressed that I already knew my size (I had a fabric tape at home), and I can honestly say it was one of the best experiences if my life, and up to this point have never felt so accepted (apart from egg_irl and traaa, but in person is a whole different thing). Legit brings tears to my eyes when I think about it 😆
You can also have it shipped to an Amazon locker. You go pick them up at your convenience and no one else sees/knows
I had a prime account and figured out my sizes. Most the clothes i bought just can in a brown box expessially if I clicked send in fewest packages. I think so let you pick discreet shipping or at least list it. Although sometimes it arrived in a clear plastic bag so Amazon also outed me. 

It's been a long time tho since I've used discreet but most things ship in plain boxes

Sorry if that's not a lot of help
I've never actually had to use my excuse but I find it helps to have one prepared lol
OMGSH Thank you so much 🥰🥰🥰🥰🥰. 💋
That's why I suggest you start one step at a time and then move forward with more feminine clothes like skirts etc.
Yeah, it probably would. Is there a trans support network near where you live? They may be able to help you.
I'm Trans mtf too
Wat!!  No one believes the phone trick?😂 I’ve totally been doing it wrong then!😂😂damn
Yup… I’ve even used my daughters as an excuse 😂
Thank you means alot:)
The problem with prime is anyone else on your account like spouse or children can see your previous purchases, you can “archive” them so they don’t show up under normal previous purchase, but the archived stuff is still there if you go look for it. It’s really frustrating Amazon won’t let you delete purchases from history or let you have a “private” purchase not just because of this, but also makes buying presents for your spouse or kids a pain as well.
I would love to get a skirt I would feel so pretty:)
Unfortunately there is not
That's why you add them to your household and don't share your own account. You can have up to 10 members iirc and while you can share things with your spouse, it doesn't automatically do it. My wife and family have known since the beginning of my transition but it's nice for keeping gifts a secret from each other while still being able to easily add on lists for gift ideas for the kids that we can both easily update.

 It lets you share whatever media you decide on between you two as well and gives you control over what the little ones have access to from Amazon devices or services. My daughters were constantly dl'ing games on their fire tabs and filling the memory so I set it up so every app needs approval to install and I just get an email asking if it's ok.
Awww I want a skirt collection myself but I'm really insecure but I'd b so happy if you got them for urself and feel confident!!! If possible maybe post a pic of ur outfit I'd love to rate it hahah 💗
Oh I'm sorry. If you're in Canada I can give you a website of an organization that will help you.
I am in canada
Check these folks out. They're based in Calgary, but they have been known to help trans youth, and adults, all across the country. They got me my gender dysphorphia diagnosis and they're partially responsible for my referral to a speech pathologist for vocal feminization.

They may also know of an organization closer to where you live, which would be really helpful."	x8nkf4	trans	340	0.98	2022-09-08 02:09:06
I did a thing and it made me happy :)	"Still reeling from last night, it made me giddy.

Had some extra time, so I slipped out to the store to pick up a few needs and get out of the house. For the first time, I decided to go out in the closest thing I have to fem clothes (just leggings and some baggier clothing) and it felt really good. I couldn’t stop smiling under my mask.

I also went and bought myself some new clothes while I was there: a really cute t shirt and a sports bra.

I—I don’t know if I can quite deny being trans much longer. Oops. Oh well…

Aaaaaaaa I’m just really happy and wanted to share."	"Congratulations! 🥳
Awesome!  That’s a great feeling!
I’m so happy for you! I love getting gender affirming clothes too! 
Still cis tho
nice! proud of you <3
Congratulations it i an amazing feeling
Racer Backs are great.
Congratsss! Funny thing: I stopped denying that I was trans today as well (ftm though, but still)
Congratulations
Well done I’m so proud
You want a medal or sum Shidiot
Yup! Still…still cis tho… *right*?"	uccjb6	trans	337	0.97	2022-04-26 13:25:57
I can't take this anymore.	"I just can't fucking live normally anymore. Ever since I started questioning my gender, my life has been going down hill. I have been more depressed than I have been for years. I just wish I was fucking normal.

I try to cheer myself up with gender affirming clothes but half the time it just makes me feel worse because every time I look in the mirror, I hate the way I look. Every day when I go to school, I look at the girls in my class and feel so god damn envious. I try to drown out reality with video games but that doesn't seem to work anymore.

I want to start HRT so fucking bad but my parents refuse to pay for anything regarding my transition. I would be able to afford planned parenthood but they don't treat minors at my location and the nearest children's hospital is too expensive for a high school student like me. I would try to persuade my mom to help me out but arguing is fruitless with her.

Everyday it just keeps getting worse and worse. I'm terrified of where I am heading.

I feel so alone."	"You're not alone, you have us :)
I know being trans isn't ideal, it's like playing life on hard mode. 

Keep trying, it'll get better!
You ARE normal. Society has programmed us to believe that anything that falls outside of their narrow margin or definition of gender is wrong. Screw them and remember being trans is resistance and an act of defiance to those rules. Don’t let them rule your mind. They can only rule the world outside it but they can’t erase us. We have all experienced similar circumstances. Those who see it just as transitory will survive in end. Live your truth and remember that no matter what, you are beautiful, valid and you matter.and in there and be strong. I’m here for you and others are as well.
Any person who had to deal with what you are going through would be having a hard time - that doesn't make you wrong, it makes you an awesome person stuck in a shitty situation. I'm sorry things have to be so difficult for you and I hope you are able to see more options become available as time passes. They often do.
Being trans is hard, I understand. You can always talk to me if you feel lonely. My dms are always open 😊
I don't know how you could put all of my feelings into words
I hope everything will get better, you are not alone, you have us, we have you, good luck!
I couldn't relate to you more on this. I would have screaming matches with my mom about starting HRT and my family were never really on board and I felt horrible and alone and just wanted to quit. But as soon as I became an adult I went straight to my doctor to let her know that's what I've wanted for years (going somewhere like planned parenthood is good too if you can). Because as soon as you turn 18 she can't do anything about what you want to do with your body because it's your life and you wanna make yourself happy. Be safe and talk to the right people but hold out because I know you can just like I did and you will get there. <3
Wait it out to 18, 19, 20. I know that sounds like already being in the grave, but at 20 you're still basically a fucking fetus. Extremely malleable. What will shape you is your relationships in your 20s, workplace, uni, NOT your current school or family situation. People who transition in their 40s, 50s, do so because the ""never too late"" cliche is often the truth. Right now stay safe, hoard coping mechanisms, make connections in the community, save money, and look towards some slightly longer term goals (ie ""when I am legally an adult, I wanna XYZ"").
You are so uniquely you and also so many understand stand through their own experience the feelings of isolation that your experience brings. You are not alone in that never ever as you courageously face your days in waiting.😇
i’m with you, sister. it feels almost impossible to keep going most of the time. i’m a trans ftm highschooler. there’s no one i can talk to about this, aside from my therapist who insists that i’m just depressed and don’t know what to do with my life. i don’t know if you feel this too, but i can’t even look in the mirror anymore, and being at school all day around cis guys just fills me to the brim with jealousy. i see these handsome tall men just walk around having no clue that i’d kill to have their life for even a day. then i go home to house that showers me in femininity, while everyone else my age is out there living out their teen years to the fullest. 

the best thing you can do in the current moment is to try to find things that can distract you. i know you said video games used to help, they also used to help me as well. but we all get burnt out of at some point. obviously, if you have friends doing things with them is great. but if you’re like me, who has a really hard time making friends, then you have to find things that help you enjoy your own company. basically you have to be your own friend. which is really really REALLY hard especially since we feel so uncomfortable all the time. the best thing i’ve found for myself is hiking, but even that doesn’t solve my misery. 

but hang in there, us trans youth need to stick together. i know my comment wasn’t very helpful per say but i just want you to know that you’re not alone in this battle. i’m with you, Aria. 

- Isaac (he/him)
I feel you so much. Every time I put on a dress (I’m AMAB or a t-shirt with a wide neck, my shoulders look like they want to escape my torso. 
FaceApp has been one of the many ways I have escaped so far, but it only ever makes the dysphoria a little bit smaller. 
The hardest part about transitioning is looking at yourself and saying that it’s good enough for now.

Are you living in a rather conservative leaning area? Because I would recommend you talk to your student councilor, but if you are scared about it, it is completely understandable.
Just remember you are not alone. you matter and you are special. I am older so let me say that when you are younger everything seems so absolute and huge. I know this issue is HUGE  but i’m saying there is a lot of life ahead of you and i’m sure once get out from under your parents thumb you will blossom to the person you are meant to be.  Keep your head up. 🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️ My Dms are open if you need to talk!
Instead of focusing on HRT have your talked to her about your mental state? That might get her attention more. Honestly I'm not sure if that even a good or bad thing.

Make your goal getting out. There is a life beyond your parents. Dive into learning about how to be self sufficient, financial literacy, the boring how-to's in life. If you're in the US look into what plans on the marketplace allow for gender affirming therapies. This isn't glamorous stuff but it will serve you well when it's time to go.
Hey.

You are not alone in this.

I know this sounds rich coming from an internet stranger, but I do understand how you feel. I've been through similar times in my life. There were times when I felt hopeless and powerless, when I wanted to give everything up and just disappear from the face of the world. I did not, and I am glad for it.

One day it will get better. I promise. But you need to keep going in order to see that day. So, please, stay strong, in spite of how enormously difficult it can be, because it will be worth it in the end.
I feel for you girl.  When I was young there were not a lot of great resources that even helped me identify why I didn't feel right let alone see a path to addressing it.  Can't recommend my chosen path, and would instead recommend seeing if your parents can help you get appointments with a therapist to help you develop a healthy coping mechanism until you are free of their thrall. 

I am not saying ignore your trans identity but if you can build healthy management techniques then those same techniques will serve you the rest of your life.  

Good luck!
Don't let it discourage you, where you are now has nothing to do with where you'll be in a few years. Try not to worry about the end result right now and just do small gender-affirming things. If you're a minor, you still have your whole life ahead of you.
I get it, these feelings and wanting to be a girl have been building inside me for almost 7 years now. I have been trying to ignore them but I can't anymore. I haven't told anyone who knows me irl but i think i have to it is starting to tear me apart. I have not had problems with anxiety in the past and now I am super anxious and nervous they'll find out eventually and I don't know what will happen. Since my parents are verbally against trans people and on top of that I am christian so that opens up a whole mess of stuff that is freaking me out. Just try to power through and find an anchor. Mine right now is a friend I meet online without her idk that I would do.
I felt the same way when I started questioning too.   
Now (even if im not out yet) I feel better, the pain doesn't last forever hang in there girl✊🏽
I see you and hear you. Not the person that people think you are but the person you know you are. When I'm going through the dark moments I'm reminded of a section of a poem by Rainer Maria Rilke. The larger poem is one thing but this passage has helped me with so much.

*Let everything happen to you: beauty and terror. Just keep going. No feeling is final.*
Fuck, I kinda want to be sorry for you but I know the last thing you need is my pity.

Just know that you ARE normal, trans individuals had existed in humanity since our very first civilizations, it's today's society that treat trans people badly (and actually most society's treated trans people really well so modern society is the one who's weird, not you!). And if you need someone to talk to I would be more than glad!
i cant take this anymore. i just cant live normally anymore. ever since i started playing among us my life has been going down hill. i have been more depressed than i have been for years. i just wish i was fucking normal.
Find a university near a place that fofills your heart, mind, and goals. Good luck
Instead of arguing with your mom, just tell her how you feel. Like really explain the depth of your feelings, no sugarcoating, no omitting. I know it can be really embarrassing, maybe you feel some shame over how you feel. Don't, this is your reality. There is no arguing with that.

My parents didn't really understand and were a bit skeptical, until I told them how I felt exactly and with no hold barred. They have never made any sounds of dissonance since then.

Either she accepts it and helps you or she has to live with putting her child through this torture. Either way you have a better chance with that than you do by not doing so.

I know you can get through this. You are strong enough.
Look into [Plume.](https://getplume.co) I don’t know young you can sign up (probably need to be an adult for informed consent). But for like $90, plus assistance on HRT prescriptions (though I use a program through a local grocery chain), I get counseling, prescriptions, blood work, all online through my phone and email.
Hello fellow transgender from czechoslovakia :D
Do you have access to therapy? That helps.
thats so true. Seems like playing new game+ on deathmarch in witcher3 but with ciri lol
Thank you, it means a lot. <3
It’s so nice to hear that someone who, was in a similar situation as I, managed to come out on top. Your words mean more than you know, thank you. <3
Uggh. I want to talk to her about how it’s affecting me mentally but anytime I mention anything, she insists she doesn’t have the money even though it’s quite obvious that we aren’t exactly “poor.” Her financials aren’t really my business though. It frustrates me but at the end of the day, it’s her money.

I think my dad has decent insurance but he’s the type to think the government is tracking him with microchips in the Covid vaccine soo my chances aren’t amazing with him.

Thanks for the advice though. I really appreciate it. <3
Hello fellow Christian!
This means a lot to hear, thank you so much. <3
Among us 😩
23r1 from the yeet discord😳
Wait, so prescriptions are included?
Ofc 😊
of course!! I hope you can feel like you've come out on top too! ik it sucks being where you are now and I've felt horrible about it too especially seeing people start HRT and maybe having trans friends and feeling left behind because you have to wait but it's so worth it. I kept going just to spite the people who didn't want me to. If you ever wanna pm me im always open to talk or just listen :)
It sounds like she's in denial mode, which is really hard to deal with when there's a power imbalance. Take walks, get plenty of rest, hang out in supportive or at least neutral spaces. If it's possible look for a part time job. There are mental health professionals out there that work on a sliding scale and if you make a habit out of being out of the house it won't be weird to slip out for an appointment. Hell if you're working she's going to think you're back on course. I'm not sure how old you are but the age of medical consent varies from state to state, so this a) never has to go on her insurance in the first place and b) if you're at that age (in my state it's 14) you can make it so she can't access your information. 

There is life after this. You can make it. And while it would be best if you had the support of your parents and I'm all for giving parents the time and space to figure their shit out, it can still be good even if they don't.

just learned i accidentally threw away 10 dollars i was planning to use to buy fem clothes	i feel like curling up and dying rn	"you got a PayPal?
That hurts
Aw that sucks girl but it'll be okay! I've got like zero disposable income so I know the pain of realizing you've lost or misused some money you were planning on using for yourself. At least it was 10 dollars and not too too much.
I'm sorry for you hun it's sad that happened but tbh no offence but 10 dollars wouldn't get much
Lmao me too

Depends. Goodwill Outlet sells clothes for $2.59/lb.
Yeah I recently went shopping with my genderfluid buddy, and for £10 I got a pair of jeanshorts and that's it. So if shopping for fem stuff, you'll need a bit more than 10$

Gender Swap Day As A Trans Person	We have a gender swap day in school coming soon, I myself am a trans guy but not out to anyone but some of my friends, I already dress masculine and don't own very feminine clothes. What kind of clothes should I use on the day??	"Maybe you could come out by wearing feminine clothing lol. The ol’ switcheroo
The simple answer us whichever one's will make you comfortable! If wearing feminine clothing will cause you dysphoria and masculine clothing is better, then wear masculine clothing. If you would feel better wearing feminine clothing for the day, wear that.

 If you are worried about being outed by wearing feminine clothes on gender swap day, you could probably excuse it by saying either 1. That you're not participating (might not work if people pay attention to what you usually wear) or 2. That since you dress more masculine/wear men's clothes (for ""comfort"", of course) day to day, this would spice up the challenge a little more.
Now the concept of gender “swap” is kind of dated but what about a day where everyone dressed as either the opposite binary gender or if they don’t like that they just wear what they want and try to make it sorta extra. I’m sure gender swap day has led to many a questioning(or non questioning) person realizing they’re trans. “Wow feminine clothes make me feel more comfortable” “wow masc clothes make me feel more comfortable” “wow, atleast ik they both suck and can go for a more androgynous approach to fashion”
What the fuck is a gender swap day.. that sounds really strange
Kinda wish I was a mom so I could say its ok to stay home and play videogames instead
Gender swap and don't swap back
oh god they’re still doing these? i would wear a shirt that says Gender Swap Days Are Transphobic
I’d complain to admin that it’s offensive and enforces stereotypes we want to erase rather than perpetuate. Squeaky wheel gets the grease.
when we had that in school a few girls (and a closeted trans man at the time) painted on beards and chest hair using make-up.

sadly i didnt get to do it because i forgot about it, and id have to find a dress that fit me and stuff
Use the “oh that was today?” Line?
As a trans guy myself, I would buy some hyper feminine clothing.
Depends if you're comfortable doing that. Gender swaps aren't exactly kosher these days for many (though I was always into 'em as a kid because I wanted to turn into a boy) 

If it was me I'd ask if I could stay home or I'd just ignore it completely. But hey, up to you!
It would be funny/pretty awesome if everyone wore what they usually do, since clothes don't need to be gendered.
What the heck is that!?!? What do you even swap? Toxic stereotypical presentations?  Seems like a very harmful practice no matter what gender you are on the spectrum.  The school has got to know this…
I don’t know how to feel about gender swap day, 
I have mixed feelings on it tbh.
Do whatever makes you feel comfortable. Or just dress how you normally do and say you forgot what day it was.
I would go to Goodwill and buy the most ridiculous girly dress you can find lol.
You have a gender swap day!!   Do you live in an anime or something? that sounds super interesting..
Dress normally. ""It's gender swap day every day bitches!""
Just come with the most normal close you can and no binding or anything. 

Then if askdd say ""i am gender swaped all the time"" 
But for real think if you wona put yourself or no.
Write on a t-shirt in sharpie ""Clothes have no gender"" and wear that.
What date is it?
On one hand, it sounds like that school is stuck somewhere 20 years ago.  On the other, I wish one of the many schools I went to had that.

Also, perfect time to come out completely!
Wait what happens if ur nb


Also maybe you could wear feminine clothing and come out that way!
Just a suggestion
Treat it like a pajamas day and say you swapped to your night time persona?
I wish my school did this, I’d wear the formal stuff I wear for boymoding at hockey(am a trans tomboy, so it isn’t that bad)
Tbh as someone who is a transman who sometimes just flips over to enby but never ever female (fem is a different story) and who also is agender sometimes. Well I would say full on gender then? I like fem clothing but don't want to represent myself as female so I would prefer to then present myself in the binary genders which is male and again I am safe. I am a transman. But am also nonbinary because the term feels comfy for me a lot. Also genderfuck. So I would then dress as a stereotypical male. Which I also don't mind a lot. And I kinda sometimes feels like my gender is soft. Which means my gender expression would be hard.
Dress androgynously and say you're dressing up as nonbinary
A gender swap at school? Wow
Schools: you’re not allowed to change genders. You’ll go to hell.

Also school: Guys! We are having a gender swap day! It’ll be so fun!
sounds to me that your school needs some sensitivity training. like let's say you're not part of the gender-binary like do cis people think? and let's say a transwoman like that litterally the worst thing you can have like kill us why dont you.
Hey fem clothes, and don't get rid of them afterwards, keep them and wear them in secret
EDIT: I MISREAD AND MISGENEDERED OP AND GAVE INAPPLICABLE ADVICE. IM SORRY OP 🖤
Keeping this here for context to the replies 😅
This sounds like a great way to subtly come out.
But they said they're a trans guy...
Also u should go with masc clothes and just never switch back and if ur not ready to come out just say “y’all got pockets”
“Wow both of these are comfy, I should rapidly alternate between them and combine them into a terrifying blob!!”
Its a kid-friendlier way of saying crossdressing I guess.
Probably a spirit week thing, we did stuff like costume days or days where each grade wore a specific color
It’s an excuse for closeted people to wear affirming clothes for a day :)
I like this!
Idk I could see it being a positive. Back in HS when we did that it made me realize how nice skirts were. That was the first crack in the eggshell
i wish my school had one :(
I really have to disagree with you here, gender swap day was one of the most gender euphoric days I had as a kid before I knew I was trans. We only got to have it for one year but it was the first step I got to take in feeling like my real gender, and it was amazing. I hope that there are other trans kids that this may hep them realize who they are by having this social opportunity that allows for expression with less chance of discrimination.

Edit: when it got removed from parent complaints I was so sad because I was sooo looking foreword to doing it again.
😭 as an egg these were the few times I got to express myself in a socially acceptable manner. It helped me ease into being comfortable. Not is trans in the same way and I’m gender non-conforming now. How am I supposed to dress to make you happy??
Next Tuesday so I think that's The 8th
You might have misunderstod This, I'm a trans guy (FtM) and I usually use masculine clothes bc they make me more comfortable but I'm just not out as a guy yet
They litterally said that they're a guy
I can't tell if you misread something or if you're bening genuine
Yes, typically men wear masculine clothes so for gender swap day a man who is trans could wear feminine clothes
You could know you are trans earlier if you were educated about gender if they do a  brief explanation about it im down
I understand that for some kids it’s a huge opportunity, but growing up in an extremely conservative area it was often used as a day to literally make fun of trans people. 

Like cis guys in skirts and gaudy makeup talking with their voices up all day, making gruesome jokes and swipes about being cross dressers or transvestites. And those same parent complaints were likely rooted in transphobia, not progress. For closeted kids, hearing what are possibly your parents objecting to a day to present as yourself often creates fear. 

As a teacher in the same area, who is trans, I strongly object to activities that simplify gender down to pink or blue. I’m glad it was a big day for you a good experience, though. It’s a lucky thing.
Wow, I had no clue
Probably misread and thought op was trans fme
Holy shit that's embarassing so sorry OP 😭😭
Aghhhh no I completely misread, I'm sorry OP, hope it didn't make you feel shitty 🖤
I think they thought the op was trans fem
I mean they're FtM...
I definitely agree it differs from area to area, which is such a shame. But the transphobia is still occurring in those areas regardless of gender swap day, and a single opportunity to feel comfortable in your clothing/skin in my eyes is worth it especially when there may be no other opportunities that they may get for a long while depending on their situation.
Yep, high as shit and completely misread. Apologies to OP, only meant love and support 🖤
Oh nono it's fine
Yeah I was high as and totally misread 😔 Just wanted to be supportive but accidentally did the opposite 😅😅 I just hope it didn't make op feel shitty and he knows it was a miscommunication on my part
Yes, they are ftm, also known as a trans man. For gender swap day, a man would swap genders to woman.
That sounds terribly dysphoria inducing... But I see what you mean now.
Yeah, I wouldn't be comfortable with that
Depends on a lot of things. I’m far enough along in my transition that feminine clothes don’t give me dysphoria, but for other guys they never feel comfortable in feminine clothes.
Right? I'd be uncomfortable doing that too. I didn't transition to present as my AGAB. Though others might be fine with it (and that's cool if they do), but count me out of it lol!
That makes sense, yeah. For me, I'm too early in my transition to feel comfortable wearing masc clothes in public. But if others are comfortable with it, then go for it! Do what you wanna do!

I misunderstood what was said. And wanted to help put a stop to people assuming every trans person on Reddit's transfemme, you know? I got a bit over-zealous. My bad!"	shwli1	trans	308	0.99	2022-02-01 14:43:54

I'm pretty sure you're just envious of her courage to be herself.

Why else would you take your time to lurk trans subreddits and bash trans women?

If something annoys you so much it must mean something for you... just saying...

I have seen homophobes came out as gay after accepting themselves. Maybe you should look inside yourself instead of insulting others.
Get a fucking life terf
Why are you even here?
Wow your post history is a goddamn mess. Not just transphobic but racist too. How do you expect to ever love or be loved if you're so consumed with hate?
Dang, after taking a look at your post history you sure are a huge fucking mess lmao"	bvke5m	trans	315	0.99	2019-06-01 12:41:11
Yooooo, ya all won't belive what just happened to me! Even I still hardly belive it! Don't give up!	"So I woke up today to what I thought was going to be another shitty day in this shitty world (we all have such days don't we?) my parents didn't talk with me for a few days since I came out to them and tried to talk with them about my problems, even when I passed my IT exams two days ago they didn't call after they ended to check on me or congratulate me or smth as they always did, all communication I had with them was at most ""go do that"" or ""I don't feel like talking today"" for the last few days.

So to the point I woke up today, while taking a shower at about 6 am I started to cry under the shower instead of going out to school for like 30 minutes I was just sitting there, cuddling myself like a turtle, which is why I was late for my train and I knew at that moment that I will make it to school only for two out of five lessons (my school is about 60 km away so an hour ride by train) but still I decided that fuck it (my frequency in school is shit) it can't get worse than that, and so I embarked on my journey...

School went well, I talked with my best friend vented a bit and calmed down and just when I wanted to head straight to my comeback train i received a message from my father, he said that he send me (calling me by my CHOSEN NAME like WTF) some money so I can spend it on myself to feel better, he said that I can't talk about it with my mother as she is still in denial and is partly blaming herself for me being trans and that he will work it out with her while helping me to figure out my problems.

And so with a new life energy a bit cheered up and with hope that everything will sort itself out I went shopping, I checked male part of the shop first as I was still a bit ashamed and I was looking for some gender neutral clothes but to my avail I couldn't find anything good, and so just as I was about to leave i said to myself (yet again) ""fuck it let's roll with it I have only one life and it's time I live it as my true self"" and so I went on to browse in women's section, with a bit of shame and with my voice cracking one time I asked shop personel for help, and after a little friendly chat that sweet girl figured it out (I'm probably not the first closeted lgbt person in her career) and asked me which pronouns I prefer if she may ask, she then called me by she/her, helped me with sizes, styles, said some things about different materials and so on, she was so helpful and kind and understanding!

It was my first time shopping as a girl and in girls portion of the store and it was so good! Even tho I felf a bit uncertain at first it felt both amazing and just right at the end! 

TL:DR - After another shitty morning I was accepted by my father, went shopping as a girl for girl clothes and I can ride on that high for a month now!  NEVER GIVE UP AND GIVE IT YOUR ALL LIFE CAN BE BEAUTIFUL"	"Baby trans steps 🥰
Good for you! This was awesome to read. Thanks for sharing!!! 💙💖💙
Another moment of the gender euphoria that cis people can never know. 

I’m so happy for you! 🤗🤗🤗
I'm happy that there are parents who accept their children... Wish mine could...
Your dad is an absolute Chad
A really important day I'm happy for you. Remember this.
Hey, I'm really proud of you. That first store experience is really hard, I had mine recently too.

I've only gone the once but I have a feeling it's gonna be easier every time :) i hope you're proud of yourself too!!

I felt dreadful just circling the store, pretending like I don't know which section I want to be in lol
I'm glad that your dad's warming up to you and offering some support!  ☺️🤜🤛😉
This was almost believable except the bit about having a ""friend"" lmao
I came out to my parents last weekend. This resulted in a massive amount of gaslighting and them saying some horribly transphobic things to me resulting in a screamfest. I sent them an email that night about how horrible the things they told me were and how they really did hurt because I knew they would read an email from start to finish and I would be able to better word it that way.

&#x200B;

We talked on the phone the next day. They still tried to defend their position in a couple cases but did apologize for the way they acted and treated me. However, they also told me, at 21 years old, that I am on the Autism spectrum. The fact that it took me coming out to them for them to tell me this hurt because they betrayed my trust because this would have helped me a lot with dealing with issues such as emotional control and conversational skills that I was often told off for as a kid and have spent my whole life to this point learning to deal with on my own (they really thought they would never have to tell me because I have dealt with these so well that I literally pass as a neurotypical adult. I'm a junior year college student living on my own now on the other end of the country and I'm able to care for myself no problem, have a good social life, and I'm acing my engineering degree). 

&#x200B;

Since then (this was Monday), I've had extremely little contact with them. I honestly wanted space to deal with this and planned on ignoring phone calls until they at least came around on their feelings towards me. But they have been talking with me pretty minimally. My mom tried to call me once, she asked me if I was ok, I said I wasn't doing well but I loved her and got no response from there. My dad sent me new longboard wheels and bearings, something he was going to get me before I came out. I sent him an email simply thanking him and got no response from there. He didn't try to make it feel like a pity gift and I honestly don't think that was the intention, but it does indicate that at least they are not upset with me anymore.

&#x200B;

So I'm crossing my fingers to have this scenario happen to me. I texted my little brother to see if they were ok and talking about me at all. They seem to be just fine and have not been discussing me at home. I truly hope they are ultimately reflecting on both the fact that they really hurt me with the transphobic things they said as well as just how horrible and damaging it was to me to deny that I was on the spectrum until I was an adult and keep that information from me. It might be wishful thinking but I'm not ruling it out because despite all of this I know deep down my parents do love and care about me more than anything in the world and that that love does trump the narcissism that might exist at the surface. I have faith in my parents to make a change because I know under that surface they are good people and are strong enough to do it. I honestly do love you mom and dad and I hope this ends in a way that makes us a happier, healthier family by finally putting many issues that we've ignored and denied for way too long to rest. And even if I decide not to transition, I think coming out to them may be the best thing to ever happen for all of us.
I love this! I'm proud of you for being strong in the face of difficult conditions and I'm happy you're starting to get the support you deserve! Your mom will come around but like everything in life it's a process. It's not always easy for us to accept ourselves either. Big hugs!
Even tho they are just baby steps they are still a few steps forward in the right direction, towards a better future! ❤️
Yeah, I said he is my best friend because he is my ONLY friend lol, but beggars can't be choosers I guess
And your stride will get longer as you go! 💃
Oof, this hits home, I've got no friends, my local trans support group has been ignoring me since last year even after countless emails, and I'm on the stage on hrt wear cuddles and stuff are amazing now lol, I joined taimi out of curiosity and it's been funny actually being able to talk to people about stuff, like I met a cute trans girl (unfortunately she lives 600km away) and it was fun talking about hrt stuff, giving advice and just finding that you have changed from being a toxic unlikable ass into a wholesome girl that loves life now and won't flirt but listen and yeah. I need friends lol
It becomes a full on dance sooner than you think! 💜"	s9axpi	trans	315	1.0	2022-01-21 13:38:46
Came out to my wife tonight :D	Dropped the transgender bombshell and she was supportive all through the conversation, open to who I was, and that it didn't change a thing about our love for each other. Casually mentioned that I had bought some female clothing afterwards and she excitedly asked if she could see. Wrapped up the conversation complaining about how cryptic and frustrating female clothing sizes were. It felt like being one of the girls. Seven years of knowing her and she still surprises me at every turn.  Am beyond the moon.	"Same thing happened when I came out to my wife. Truly the best feeling. So happy for you!
That really is wonderful, I’m glad things worked out for you.
Congratulations 🥳. Wonderful to have a supportive partner. They are not as rare as many believe.
I am so happy for you!! I came out to my wife last night, and while it wasn't as quite as easy she was still very happy for me 😌
This is so fucking cute
Congratulations, happy for you!
literally crying, so happy for you ❤️
Congrats girl!! 💖
Wow nice!  Glad to hear that went well for you!
Hell yeah this is the good shit
Yeah, truly the best experience.  Congrats.
This is amazing. This story just makes me think of coming out to my wife. She took some time to process it, but by the end of the night, she was giving me old clothes that didn't fit and took my shopping the next day.

You know you have ""the one"" when they don't care about anything as long as you are you, and YOU are HAPPY!
My fiancee has been my biggest supporter through my transition and it’s honestly made a world of difference. I am so happy for you! :)
Congrats! 😁👍
Wish I had the confidence to come out to my wife. I have been hiding clothes and make up and all kinds of nsfw stuff from her since we met ( 8 years ago)
Very happy for you!"	s9qz1i	trans	313	0.99	2022-01-22 01:44:35
US escape plan	"My partner and I have decided it’s finally time to start making an emergency plan to leave the US. We were hoping on some input for what all should be included. Here’s what we’ve thought of so far.

- Route/Destination (Canada is the closest immediate option for us. From there, probably Spain?)

- Enough cash for food, gas, and lodging in every relevant country

- Supplies (burner phones, clothes to look cis, first aid, arms, etc)

- What will trigger the plan (we’re thinking once federal-level legislation is introduced, or if we need to start state-hopping)

- What to do with pets

What are we missing? Any advice is welcome…"	"Without knowing your situation, it’s worth pointing out that there are a handful of states with actual protections for us in law. But I understand
If you plan to live and work in your refuge country, make sure that you know the immigration laws and maybe even start on them now. Canada generally doesn’t recognize refugee claims for Americans. There are many legal pathways into Canada from the USA, but most will be out of reach for most people. 

The easiest would be a study permit, and your partner can get a work permit based on your study permit. The student can’t work full time, but the partner can. After you’ve completed your program, you can apply to stay for 3 more years.

Immigration is a lot of work and paperwork. It’s best to get started as soon as you can.
You're not overreacting.  

#1 thing is to get a passport with your deadname on it if you haven't done a legal name change. 

#2, are you of Italian descent?  If so, then you may well qualify for bloodline descent citizenship.  It requires a greater or lesser degree of documents to prove your line of descent, and *time*, because the consulates have a multi year backlog.  

My partner is on track to have her citizenship process be official sometime in 2025.  The *day* her citizenship is recognized I can file paperwork to get citizenship as her spouse, with documents of Italian language proficiency.  

Why Italy?  It's an EU country, so Italian citizenship gices you access to living and working throughout the EU. 

#3, make friends with transfolk in Europe, including American transfolk that are getting out via option #3.
If you're planning to go to Spain, start learning the language.

If you gotta go before you get to learn it properly, get a Spanish dictionary, just in case you got troubles with your phone 

And arms ? If you travel like in an airport that's just gonna be dangerous
Here are a few major roadblocks to be aware of, in addition to all the practical things already said:

No country accepts asylum seekers from the US. Not one. This means you can only emigrate as a skilled worker or as one who’s going to invest in the local economy. 

Generally speaking to qualify for this type of immigration you need to meet a few qualifications. The specifics vary and this isn’t necessarily 100% true for every single place you could go, but most will apply universally and will be at least similar to these. 

You need a degree. An advanced degree is ideal here, an undergrad may or may not not cut it depending on the field. 

You need a job lined up. The employer will need to sponsor your immigration application while also giving proof that they cannot reasonably hire a native citizen. 

Alternatively you can also go for the express purpose of running a business in some places but this means you need a ton of cash on hand to support it. 

A neat exception to this is the Netherlands, where you can go to be self-employed (explicitly *not* being eligible to be hired in NL) with a minimum of $10k USD on hand. 

You need living expenses for at least a year, if not two or even three. These need to be in liquid assets. This is not an insignificant amount of money and you cannot argue that borderline poverty living is okay. Basically having like $10-20k for each year isn’t going to cut it. 

You cannot have a criminal record. Often a simple misdemeanor is enough to disqualify you outright. You can’t even visit a lot of countries with a record. 

A lot of disabilities will disqualify you. There’s a lot of nuance and variability to this so I don’t want to get too deep. 

The basic idea here is that you have to prove beyond reasonable doubt that you will be a productive and contributing member of society, who is in no way, shape, or form an extra burden on their social welfare systems. 

Long story short, if you’re not bringing unique special skills to the table, *and* have the means to support yourself, nobody will want to take you in. I’m not here to debate the ethics of it but it is what it is. 

There are a few places where if your parents or grandparents emigrated from a country you can use that to return to your “homeland” - though this is more the exception than the rule and it’s still a long, expensive process.
I don't have a definitive answer, just some thoughts:

Have all documents ready. Not only passports, but all essential documents (birth certificate, diplomas, proof of vaccinations, etc.)

You might not be allowed to carry arms across a border and disposing of them is probably difficult when you're at one.

Get comfortable with the idea that you might not be able to take your pets with you. Either for legal reasons (vaccinations, etc. , idk) or for practical ones.

What type of federal legislation are you thinking about: Restrictions on access to health care, outright bans or something else? There are things that make life hard(er) and ones that make it impossible.

As hard as it sounds, relying on an emergency plan is risky by nature. If you believe you'll need it within the next few years, the sounder strategy would be to actually find a way to legally emigrate to a safe country. Find one where you're able to meet the requirements (study, work, etc.) and take the necessary steps. Being a migrant is by far easier than being a refugee. And as others have mentioned, most countries don't consider asylum claims from US citizens.
Minnesota. We are a safe haven state, and we border Canada. The Twin Cities metro is very queer friendly and is only around 6-7ish hours from the border. There is also Duluth, which is closer to the border and also queer friendly.
If your plan is Canada, or honestly anywhere, I would scrap the emergency exit plan simply because most countries probably (unfortunately) won't recognize Americans fleeing over anti-trans legislation as refugees (but I suppose that depends on how horrific things may get). Instead, I would choose a country and start working on a plan to emigrate, as the paperwork and legal work involved may take years (definitely will for Canada) to complete. Get out while you can, stay safe.
I wish I could flee so badly. But it's not an option for all of us, especially those over 30 or disabled.
And Americans can’t simply move to Canada, if you have certain education (Doctor, Engineer) you can apply for residency.
To everyone saying no country accepts asylum seekers from the US: please remember that is only presently. I’m confident many countries will accept American trans refugees if/when our rights are restricted on the federal level, since at that point we’re undeniably threatened if we remain in the country.
I have a bug out bag, but that's mostly due to the [world3 model for the BAU2 track](https://dash.harvard.edu/handle/1/37364868). Also, therapy is worthwhile. No matter what your perspective is stuff is scary atm and that takes a toll on the psych.
Make sure you qualify to enter a country if you plan on living there. Even here in Canada you can't just move here. There's a process.
If you have a bachelors degree and make at least $400 a month, you can get the professional visa in Ecuador and that can be a route to a non-US citizenship in the case of an emergency situation. That’s likely our plan. Ecuador has legal protections for trans people and more strict gun regulation. Don’t believe the propaganda about Latin countries being unsafe.
Ireland might be worth looking into.. there’s a documentary season on Amazon video about transgender citizens and how they can change their gender based on self-identification alone.. 

It’s called “My Trans Life”
I'm going to second everyone saying that once you get to the point of needing to leave in an emergency, it may already be too late. You can maybe plan last minute travel for ""tourism"" but you cannot rely on that long term. Unless you are able to maintain work while moving between shengen and non-snengen countries every 90 days. But technically the work would be illegal.

Your best bet is to start researching legal immigration yesterday and going somewhere you can stay. Or moving to a safe US state
I would purchase some bitcoin. It can't be confiscated by anyone. Usually genocidal events target the minorities finances to prevent people from leaving. You can store wealth by commiting a seed phrase to memory or an easy to hide usb stick. Handy if you have to flee and your accounts are frozen. Also anyone can send you money from anywhere in the world cheaply and fast which is golden when you are on the run. Added bonus is that you can order DIY HRT with bitcoin to anywhere in the world so if you are caught in a bureaucracy you don't have to take a break from HRT. 

Be safe. Much love. 💖
I have no idea what else you could do, but good luck and stay safe.
If your referring to firearms and weapons you will need to check the legality of them for Canada.  They recently changed the rules and banned all assault rifles style guns. 

As well start contacting your vets and making sure your pets are up to date on all applicable shots and certifications for taking them over the border.
Make sure to have all your important documents.

-Birth certificates
-passports
-ID's/Licenses (you will have to get new ones wherever you end up but you should still have these on hand)
  
Spain is a great country all around. I'd definitely recommended heading there after Canada.

For pets you can get pet passports. That way they can come with you.
I know it's getting pretty bad in some states and it could get worse but burner phones? This is a genuine question, in what situation would burner phones be necessary?
I personally plan on staying in CA. Easy access to 2 different borders via I5 plus I know the desert in the border areas pretty well. I am of the understanding that Canada is going the wait-and-see route with offering asylum. I hope this changes. But I'm personally planning on taking a my-cold-dead-hands attitude towards all of this.
i hate that this is a serious conversation we have to have rn. the us is such a shitty place
I would add Scotland to the mix. My country is still trying to pass laws to make it easier for people to change their identity but the populace vote mostly for left wing parties  and we're the only country that teaches LGBT education in schools. But the culture is mostly nobody gives a shit 😊
Go back to Massachusetts where I’m from, quick get married to my gf (she’s a German citizen) and move to Germany. Parents would help financially, maybe even come with.
I'm probably gonna try to get out of Tennessee soon myself, so I totally understand. Im personally planning for the northeast US, but if things get bad enough, I'd say Canada.  

Canada has been great when I've been up before. Especially loved Toronto and Montreal. Montreal was even having a public BDSM photoshoot near Chinatown when I was there back in September. Was a very chill place.
Is anyone else planning to stay and be part of the resistance, or are we all planning to evacuate?
As an asian immigrant, this is ridiculous…
This country is like a heaven for lgbt people (I’m in CA)
Why not just relocating to different state?
If I’m not mistaken Canada has refuge status for trans people in the US due to the immense hostility here. It’s not as simple as saying you’re trans and walking in, but it may help expedite any issues with moving to Canada.
Canada is pushing though a special law for refugee status for discrimination on transgender status.
Aren’t you overreacting a little
I would never be able to flee the US but if I could I would want to go to either Australia or Thailand. Granted Thailand's government isn't the greatest but the people and culture there is very nice.
If you wish to move to Spain or any country in the EU for that matter. Check if you have Italian ancestors. If so you may be entitled to Italian and by extent EU a citizenship if said ancestor lived in Italy between 1861 and 1943.
Best of luck either way
That's a big plan. Good luck.
We've been planning this for a while... but can't get anywhere with plans 😭😭😭
The Underground Railroad is making a comeback it seems or more accurately it should.
Oof... Yeah, I recently started looking into similar-ish... Though my primary interest atm is Norway. I mean I speak a bit of broken German, but I've recently started trying to learn Norwegian, too. I don't know of any blood line with regards to Germany, and my research seems to suggest that it would be rather difficult to make Germany work out. That, and I just generally feel like Norway would be a better fit for me. I mean, I guess there's also Sweden. Sweden doesn't require you to learn Swedish, for one thing. IDK though, Sweden doesn't particularly interest me. I would go on myself, but I've probably blabbered on about myself too much. What can I say? I'm autistic. 🤷🏻‍♀️
r/AmerExit might have some helpful info
Keep looking into trans-friendly countries! If the US suddenly go all out on transphobia, then other countries might feel the need to “inspect” you to make sure you’re not trans and coming to “invade” their country. I think Canada is safe though. I’m just thinking about how that’s what it was like with the Jews and whatnot. Some countries just straight up didn’t want them
Good luck and i hope to God that you don't need it
I'm actually going to be going to Colorado because of this. I can't afford to travel to Canada or anything like that. It's a better alternative to leaving the US because it's not likely this goes federal(from speaking to my uncle who understands these things). 

But other things to think about should you do this are:

Passports

Finding the embassy for the country you're going to(this is if you're choosing to seek asylum)

I wouldn't take any sort of weapon with you(especially firearms), as I don't think you'll be allowed to have it past Canada. 

Go online to find and maybe start making friends from the end goal country who may be able to sponsor you into you get citizenship(you may or may not be able to do this)
It might be an overreaction, but if things get as bad as they potentially could, I’d feel much safer getting as far from here as possible
I'm in NY and am considering making similar plans. Federal legislation could still be an issue.

I live less than an hour from the boarder *because* I was concerned by the Trump presidency and had an opportunity to move in 2019
That’s part of the trouble, that no where really does recognize it at the moment. I was looking at Rainbow Railroad (just casually, not because I need them rn) and was surprised to see they don’t even offer trans people help for getting out of the particularly bad states yet. Hopefully these kinds of policies will be revised if things get too bad, but I wouldn’t count on it
Just to add - it’s really easy to get permeant residency through the Canadian Experience Class after you obtain the post graduate work visa.
Germany also has a bloodline decent citizenship.
1/8th Italian with language “proficiency” (I can understand pretty well, but have a hard time speaking beyond a child’s level), that might qualify? 

I definitely don’t want to live in Italy though, I’ve heard they’ve been becoming particularly fascist recently. But like you said, maybe a citizenship could allow me to live elsewhere in EU?

Thanks for the super well thought-out response!
Arms are mostly just for getting out of the US, we’ll probably ditch them once we get to the border. And we’re planning on traveling by car, since there’s less security and monitoring. 

As for the language, my partner comes from a partly-Spanish family. Even though they’re not completely fluent themselves, they know enough to get by at least at first. As for myself, I have a decent understanding of Italian so I’m hoping that learning a language with the same roots won’t be too bad. But you’re right, definitely a good time to start practicing.
Correction: If you are planning to go to anywhere where the main language is spanish, start learning the language. I would really like to recommend trans folks from US to mexico or other latam countries but the reality is that would contribute to make the actual gentrification issue worst, specially if their digit nomads
Yeah I think arms would be more of a problem. Maybe you could take a baseball bat instead of something like that.
""We, the undersigned, residents of Canada, call upon the House of Commons to extend to transgender and nonbinary people the right to claim asylum in Canada by reason of eliminationist laws in their home countries, whatever country that may be,"" reads the e-petition.  How would USA not follow under that?
That is fucked up but sadly it's how the world works...
I agree with this 100%. I live in the Twin Cities. Minneapolis has the largest queer population after San Fransisco. It's very trans & queer friendly in most places. I've only had one person in over a year that did anything, and that was just laugh at me. Most people are neutral about it; or you might get some odd looks, but that's it.

We are a very blue state: House, Senate, & our governor are absolutely amazing. He just signed an emergency order to secure trans rights/protections, while the bill for it was going through legislation. It passed, and he signed it into law. 

I am extremely fortunate to have the luxury of feeling safe in the state I live in. It's a state I've always loved to live in, but now I love it even more! There are so many people that don't or can't have that.
Unfortunately relying on that means that things need to get bad before you can leave. The laws might not be enough to convince countries to allow asylum seekers. In that case you are waiting for something even worse to convince them, and you don't want to be a part of that
If you’re looking for help leaving, I’ve been working with friends who have already left to try putting together some sort of trans Underground Railroad so that we can know folks outside the country to go to. We’ve been planning our exit for years and have researched extensively where we can go and what our best options are financially.
This is a good point! I’ve never really thought of bitcoin, well, at all. Could be a good thing to look into for sure
This is the only convincing reason to have bitcoin ive heard of
Thank you ♥️🏳️‍⚧️
Definitely considering arms just to get us to the border and we’ll ditch them there. Once we get to the border, I don’t want anything that could prevent us from crossing
all those without a lot of money going for them or being stuck for other reasons, like caring for disabled or elderly family members …
That won't matter if the GOP wins.
THIS.
One MP proposed this and started a petition. That’s about it. Canada does not currently accept refugees from the US for any reason. Trans or not, the only way you’re getting into Canada as more than a tourist or student is by having money and skills. Or by marrying a Canadian and proving it’s not a “green card marriage” as we say in the US. 

Moving to Canada permanently is a lot harder than people think. I thought I’d do the same when I was younger before the reality of it slapped me in the face.
It's currently just a petition, there hasn't been a bill written for it or anything beyond it being a petition yet.
No. You’d have to be blind to not see that things are getting worse for us by the day. Politicians are openly calling for wiping our community off the face of the planet. There’s already laws proposed throughout the states that would make it illegal for us to use the bathroom, get treatment, change legal documents, and even just *be out in public*.

So no, I don’t think I’m overreacting at all.
In parts of the South laws are being pushed that will take away trans kids just because they’re trans or take away trans parent’s kids, cis or trans, because they’re “in danger” of being given gender affirming care which is considered grooming and abusive. 

They’re also fully aware that HRT and surgeries significantly reduce suicide rates and are actively trying to ban those things not only for minors but for all adults. Donald Trump promised that if he is elected he will sign an executive order to make transitioning illegal for all ages. 

Conservatives are actively attempting a genocide against trans people. It isn’t overreacting to want to get out before you lose everything
DeSantis in Florida wants to extend the death penalty to sex criminals. Do you know what the Right Wing thinks trans people are? They're setting up a legal justification to round up trans people and execute them. The entire south has a bad rash of this kind of legislature, and their sheep voter base are armed, and happily marching into this future like the good little patriots they think they are.
Yeah no.
It’s not an overreaction at all. If the GOP wins the 2024 election, which they plan on doing via cheating, we can kiss “blue state protections” goodbye. 

Spain is good for us but from what I understand having their own severe economic issues at the moment and that can always lead to a surging far-right.

If you want warm weather, Costa Rica is surprisingly super trans-friendly and isn’t super expensive to live in. It’s also easy to get citizenship there and you can medically transition under state health care as a non-citizen (I think you just need a residency permit but don’t quote me on that) Idk much else about them tho besides that they have sloths (lots of sloths 🥰), so I would still do some more research about safety and stuff before making that decision. 

If you have money, you can move to Malta pretty easily, cuz a lot of the process for becoming a citizen there is literally just paying them lol and they’re one of the best countries in the world for trans people. CoL is also actually cheaper there than the U.S on average. 

Canada is really good for trans rights rn, and that’s def a good place to go to first (I live like right on the Canadian border so that’s what I’m gonna do). But keep in mind they also have a resurgent far-right and if things get bad enough here that we need to flee to Canada, there’s no guarantee that the Canadian far-right won’t be empowered enough to take control. Idk enough about Canadian politics to estimate how likely it is, but it’s definitely possible. 

Germany’s great for us as well, and their energy crisis is finally getting better, but they *also* have a surging far right, and I’m sure an influx of trans refugees from the U.S wouldn’t exactly help that situation lol. 

Ireland is gorgeous and also pretty good for us, but the cities are expensive, and idk anything about the Irish countryside except that its gd beautiful. 

Those are all the countries I’ve looked into cuz I speak the primary languages there (besides Irish which is on my list), but I’m sure there are a lot of other good options. Just make sure you know everything you possibly can. I’ve moved across the U.S several times and *that* was incredibly difficult and expensive lol so I imagine moving to a whole new country is much harder.
Try not to worry too much.  I’m noticing more and more people speaking out in defense of us in my veterans groups.  It’s bleak but there is also a lot of support.
It's not overreacting.
Get an English language teaching certification - that will allow you to get jobs in a lot of countries, is pretty low cost and might buy you time to figure things out.
Yes, but you can't claim German citizenship by bloodline unless your ancestors didn't leave Germany prior to 1904. Trust me, I have looked into it.
Huh, good to know!   I'll look into that as well.

Italy also has a treaty tonprevent double taxation from America.  So there's that too.
Language proficiency only mattwrs if you are *applying* for citizenship, like I will be, as the spouse of an Italian citizen, or if I was a permanent resident already.  

With bloodline citizenship, under Italian law *you already are* an Italian citizen.  You just have to prove it.  That means birth cerificates, etc, including your ancestors in Italy.  Ellis Island name changes can make proving that suuuper fun.  

It really comes down to this though (there are niche cases that I'll skip over).  

Your first ancestor born in America was born *before* their parent naturalized.  In other words, they were born in America while their parent was *only* an Italian citizen.  If this is prior to 1948 it has to be through a male immigrant, but that is increasingly being challenged successfully in Italian courts.  

Lastly, though this rarely matters, the original immigrant had to come over *after* the Unification of Italy.  So lile, if you are from the tiny group of people that came over from say, the Kingdom of Naples, or the Papal States, or Lombardy....sorry.  

And yes, Italy's government is not ideal, but it's also parliamentary, so they could be gone next month.  The important thing is it gives you access to the entire EU, and out of America.
And to further clarify, Italt *does not* care about the American rationale of ""1/8th"" or ay of that blood quantum stuff.  It's just proving a line of descent, boom.
If you were an Italian citizen, you would automatically have the right to work/stay in any Schengen-area state indefinitely. That's a large portion of Europe, certainly all the least transphobic parts of the continent. I'm from Finland myself - the bigger cities aren't bad at all here, but the language can be pretty rough to learn and if you don't know it your job options are a lot more limited.
If you’re heading to Canada with arms - you gotta ditch them *before* you get to the border. That’s my advice!
As a board certified (kidding) Gun Nut, DM me if you have weapons questions or you want suggestions for the sort of weapons that are cheap enough to leave in a ditch at the border, but still reasonably reliable.
Well that's good !

As for the Italian yes, it'll be easier to learn Spanish if you have those basis 👌
That is just a petition at this point. Parliament has not even written a bill based on it yet.
It’s a petition. Not a law, not even a bill.
I live here too, and agree wholeheartedly. We are privileged to live here and must remember others aren’t as fortunate. I welcome all to come here!
GOP already has the Supreme Court, thats why we are already getting smacked.
My apologies. I thought it was farther along.
Small addition to Germany, there is new legislation in discussion and mostly locked in that will allow people to just tell the state their gender and receive an updated ID without the legal bs we need to go through currently for a name change, the way to get medical treatment will stay the same but you will no longer need to convince a judge that yes you are actually *insert gender here*, thoug there is also a concession in there that organisers , buisness owners etc will be able to deny women that dont look like women access to areas that are supposed to protect women. Thoug  there is also pushback against that part as it would paint the trans comunity as possibly dangerous, yet an argument could be made to a necessity to prevent people abusing the new legislation without being trans just pretending to be. However despite the later part this still feels like a step forward and who knows how said part will look when its done.
Not here to judge politics however, just wanted to add this to the germany section of your post

Come for the freedom, stay for the sloths 😀
As living in Germany I can tell that cities like Berlin, Hamburg or Cologne are really good places with big communities. About the government I wouldn’t worry and even the more conservative parties are far more left than in US. Not sure about immigration process in your case… if you have specific questions feel free to ask :D

Just a thought, if you feel like this better prepare early and leave early. Simply because immigration might need time and taking time makes things easier. If you are considering Europe for example I would start learning the language. Or even start looking for a job, with a good position moving gets easier. Or thinking further, why not staying temporarily abroad for some time and just try out? Maybe first spend your vacations there….
Both New Zealand and Australia are quite good as well
Not so sure about ireland. They used to be (and still are to an extent) very churchy with a lot of backwater rural places that have backwater rural views on the world. This is second-hand info and from N-ireland specifically, but outisde of (maybe) the cities: hard pass.
I have been born in new zealand, I hear its relitivity easy to move here. Great helthcare and trans rights. Worth looking into op!
Do you mean before 1904 or after?
And you have doubts?
And it'll definitely get worse if they win the next election
Oh shit wow I didn’t know that. I mean I wasn’t planning on staying in Canada long term that was just gonna be a temporary port of refuge til I could get somewhere else.
🦥💙❤️🤍❤️💙
Australia is terrifying and NZ seems chill af but from what I’ve heard, since nz imports basically everything they need, CoL is super high. Idk tho that’s just what I’ve heard. I’d love to live in NZ tbh so I hope it’s not true lol
I mean yea Ik they were basically a Catholic theocracy up until like the 90’s lol but I have a couple lgbtq friends in Ireland and they say it’s pretty decent. But yea we might wanna avoid the rural areas. But like, that’s kinda how it is in the U.S too lol
If your ancestors LEFT Germany BEFORE 1904, you are not eligible for citizenship by bloodline.
Doubts of what?
[deleted]
My friend, you won’t be able to get gender affirming care on a tourist visa. If that is important to you? You’ll need a more permanent option to qualify - study visa, work visa, etc.
Good point, I live in New Zealand and the cost of living is slightly ridiculous. But its honestly worth it because its such a beautiful country.
I don’t understand why you’d consider Australia terrifying? Pretty well all of our governments are left leaning and quite affirming and Melbourne is probably one of the safest places for trans people IMO
South Australia is really good! Good laws, but we've got high unemployment and a housising crisis.
That it wont pass.
Tourist visa lasts 6 months
I’ll have my own supplies
It's also quite politically stable, and seems to be moving in the right direction overall.
Oh it’s not your government I’m afraid of (altho im an anarchist so I’m generally pretty anti-state). It’s your fauna. And flora.
I wouldn't rely on something that hasn't passed, no. Don't count your chickens before they hatch, especially if your eggs are all in one basket and it's your backup emergency plan

Did I mid enough metaphors yet? Haha
Gotchya!
Yea I really wish I could get together the money to get there lol but without committing several serious felonies for financial gain there’s no way I’ll be able to save up enough money in the next couple years
Yes there some nasty critters here, but if you live in a city you’ll rarely see them
What about huntsmans cuz I hear they sometimes just live in peoples houses and like I understand they’re beneficial cuz they’re harmless and kill more dangerous pests but like nah fam
Yeah they eat flies, it’s not like they’re gunna leap out and attack you
Oh yea Ik that but I have mild arachnophobia, so like I’m not scared of little guys like jumping spiders or the other ones we get here in the states (outside of the southwest), but I can promise you if I saw a huntsman just coolin it on my fuckin ceiling I’d have a gd heart attack. I also own guns and I cannot say with 100% certainty I wouldn’t just start shooting and fuck up my house.
In that case I’ve got bad news for you about gun laws in Australia as well
I mean if I’m not scared of getting killed for being trans I can live without guns but if I live in a place with big nasty buggos I’m gonna own something with mild destructive potential that’s legal in AU"	12n4a46	trans	311	0.96	2023-04-15 14:21:11
im a cis guy that feels like a lesbian. help	"Ok so I figured out you gals would know about this kind of issues so let me get started.

Sooo im a cis guy and currently I dont want to date anyone because I find it odd to be a guy dating. I dont know why. If I were to date a girl I would LOVE for it to be a wlw relationship, nevertheless, it feels like Im fetishizing their relationships and I feel like a creep when I think about it.

When I think of a mlw or mlm relationship I just... no... I dont feel attracted to being in a gay men relationship or to dating women with a dynamic where im a man. It makes me feel sad when I think about me not being able to experience retibuted love in a way that makes me truly enjoy it. I dont know what to do or what it means. Every day I hate my body more and more and I dont know what can I do. Its so limiting!!!

And when I see wlw relationships in any form of media or irl I just think that I wont be able to ever achieve that. **Why do I care so much? why? why? why? why?**

I wish I could be a lesbian.

I wish I could feel pretty in womens clothes.

I wish I could escape this feeling of being trapped in my own self.

I wish I could feel not disconnected from reality.

I wish I could stop feeling like a creep.

I wish I could be the most real version of myself

help"	"lets just say i went down the ""im a cis girl who wants to be in a gay mlm relationship"" to the ""wait shit i AM a gay guy"" pipeline so youre in for a ride
Hmmm.  If I were in your shoes, I'd definitely be re-evaluating whether or not I'm really cis.  You might want to check out the Gender Dysphoria Bible at https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en and see if any of it resonates with you.
Well, if that's how you feel... i would maybe think about the cis part again 😅

Especialy the last sentences Sound to me like you could be trans. Many have their egg cracking for the ""loving women in a gay way"" part or the feeling disconnected part.

I can't promise that the ""creep feeling"" stuff will go away. That's sometimes partly because of society or internalized transphobia.

I would maybe think about it a bit more. Sure, the wlw part could be fetishizing to some point but the other stuff doesn't speak for that.
Hey, thus is a perfectly valid feeling. I'm a trans lesbian. before I started transitioning I felt extremely jealous every time I saw a lesbian couple. I wanted what they had. I wanted to love like they do and be perceived like they are. Taking a peak at your page I can tell you've been having a rough time with your identity. I know it's not an easy process but since you're posting it here I think it's worth mentioning that it's alright to be a trans lesbian. Even if you haven't done any surgery or hormones or anything. You are entitled to your sense of self. If you feel like a transgender lesbian then that's what you are. And there is someone out there that will love you in the way that you need.

>I wish I could be a lesbian.

>I wish I could feel pretty in womens clothes.

>I wish I could escape this feeling of being trapped in my own self.

>I wish I could feel not disconnected from reality.

>I wish I could stop feeling like a creep.

>I wish I could be the most real version of myself

You can actually do all of these things. 

I would never tell someone I’ve never met that they’re trans, but I think a lot of self reflection and a good therapist that specializes in gender identity would be a really good for you.
I had some similar thoughts before my egg cracked
I'll just say, out of all the LGBT+ communities you could have asked, you came specifically to the trans subreddit. Sounds like you might already have a specific answer you wanted to hear.
So, as a trans guy, one of the first signs I had that something wasn't quite what I thought was that dating seemed really unappealing as a woman but intriguing as a man. 

Before I realized anything, I was really into mlm stuff, I imagined myself in mlm relationships, etc. And I felt like a horrible person, because there's this narrative of ""AFAB people who are into mlm ships are evil fetishizing homophobes!!!"" So I was ashamed for years, but I couldn't just stop - straight or lesbian relationships just didn't appeal to me, so what was I supposed to do, quit liking romance?

Then I started thinking about it more deeply - about how I wanted to be seen, what made me happy, how I felt in X vs Y situation - and I realized that I was a guy. And then, obviously, the mlm thing made sense - ""oh, I'm not a horrible evil cis girl! I'm a gay man who was connecting with media that showed the kind of relationships I want to have!"" Turns out that's a common experience for gay trans men.

The point is, while I don't want to push anything on you, your experience sounds a lot like mine (except, obviously, reversed.) Might be worth thinking about other parts of your life and whether ""I'm a trans woman"" (or transfemme in general) might explain some things.
I had similar feelings before I had any gender identity thoughts in my head as well.


Try exploring alternative gender expressions
Please take this as a present : r/egg_irl
I felt like this before I realized I'm trans except with the genders flipped around. Just take your time and experiment<3
I recommend at least talking to a gender therapist. They will be neutral while you figure this out. Answer questions you might have. And hell who knows who you really are. 

Congratulations on the start of a journey. No matter how it ends up.
I actually feel similar. Apparently according to a post I made I don't have cis thinking (biological male here) 

It's not the same bc I do like men and mlm does sound normal to me, but I also have an attraction to women as well. The only thing is that I don't rlly wanna be ""the man"" of that relationship and I tend to like more dominant ppl and also other fem guys (I'm a switch) 

Not quite sure if I'm trans or nonbinary, or just gender non comforming. However I'd love to just live my life without any restrictions in regards to the fact I'm male. I strive to be as androgonous as possible

You could be a femboy, or you could be a trans woman. The question I'd ask urself would be ""how do I see myself in my happiest in the future.
Ask yourself, ""If everything in my life goes well, and I am at my happiest, where will I be in 10 years?""

If the answer is being a woman, in a happy and healthy relationship with another woman, then I think you've probably cracked it. Pun intended.

But really, this isn't something others can just straight up tell you the answer to, as awesome as that would be. Ultimately it is up to you to discover, and experiment, and figure out your own identity. It is really scary to imagine a life so different to the one you have lived so far - not to mention how awful elements of the trans experience are currently - and I think that's probably a large reason as to why so many people seem to suffer over this questioning stage. But at the end of the day, if you're trans, then it would be a life that is certainly worth living, despite everything.

Whatever your decision is on this, though, you are always welcome here! Love you sweetie and I seriously wish you the best x
This was quite relatable tbh. I remember from a previous ""cishet"" relationship constantly thinking ""Wow her family are so accepting of our lesbian relationship"" even though I was clearly a masc presenting male at the time.
These are such common first steps in the realization that you are indeed the person you wish to be already, you’re just buried under narratives of who we are supposed to be. This is not an easy journey, but it is always worth it to have everything you ever wanted. You can have that cake and eat it, too. Life gets so so much better hun. 

I would take this opportunity to trust in your own self to get where you want to go in time and just allow yourself to be without any judgement as you begin exploring the possibility that you may be a woman who feels oppressed by the imposed need to be a man, because that is what you’ve always been told. Please know you have an entire loving community here and elsewhere to make all your experiences easier and less lonely. You’re gonna be okay, love, I promise. I’m excited to hear that you’re on track to discovering how fulfilling life can be when you live your dreams as the reality you deserve. 

Be that lesbian, it sounds like you already are. ❤️
.................feel like you know what's going on........................ we're here for you, we got you, welcome to the rest of your life.
i used to say that all the time before my egg cracked!! turned out i was right🥰🥰
You're not a creep, you might wanna consider that you might not be a dude, but also keep in mind that if you feel like a dude still there is genders like bigender or pangender
Oh OP! I know that feeling so well. In reverse sort of, but still. Identified as a lesbian for a long time, but it bugged me to be someone's girlfriend. I wanted to be their boyfriend, dammit!! Being in a wlw relationship for me felt the way being in a mlw one feels for you now.
Well, anyway, turned out I'm transmasc.

When you instinctively feel a certain way, listen to your gut. You already know who you are and what you want, so trust yourself.
Still cis though 😅
Sounds rather trans
Try watching some of The L Word or the new League of Their Own. 

If you end up a teary mess wishing that was you on the screen, I suggest making some calls to the gender therapists near you and checking that your insurance covers hormone therapy.

Also, I'd be careful how much I apply the label ""cis guy"" to myself if I were you. It's a pain to scrape that thing off.
I'm not going to tell you who you are or aren't, but I'm a trans lesbian and felt much like you describe for decades until I figured it out. Always crushing on queer women and envying them, feeling like a creep for being attracted to them, thinking I was ugly, being unable to care for myself, being depressed and feeling disconnected from the world and myself all the time.

I'm still pre-everything medically speaking, but I've gained a lot of confidence since cracking my egg and starting to come out to my social circles.
i thought i was a gay man originally, and now i’m a trans woman who can’t stand men (cis men, trans dudes are hawt kings 👑)
you’re prolly not a cis guy, lol
Well um... I can't really add much since it looks like others have already given the exact advice I would've... But uh... Welcome to the sub. And I look forward to seeing your journey.
Welcome to the club girl!!!

I had a lot of similar feelings and thoughts as yourself. A lot of my friends are lesbians so lesbian relationships were so normalised for me that my dumbass thought it was perfectly cis to think of myself as one of the girls and honorary lesbian. It took years for me to connect the dots. I wish you all the best in your journey
Hey!!! 

I just wanted to say that this is 100% how I felt and probably still feel. 

And you know what? It’s okay. Yes, it’ll take time, but there’s nothing wrong with how you feel.
I think it sounds to me like you might be trans but that's only something you can decide
Discovering being trans and lesbian is kinda funny, cuz then there is the thing like ""are you gay or something?"" And is like ""yeah, but it's not the way you think"" Idk gurl, being trans and lesbian is kinda hard before transition. I recommend dating bi and pansexual women, they are the most opened.
kinda sus man idk
🥚
There was a small male lesbian movement in the '00s.  Not sure where it went.

I don't know if I'd necessarily call you cis.  You're definitely toeing the line of being a binary trans woman.
look, you are likely NOT a cis dude
I was in this exact situation not too long ago, and it sorta helped me in the end to realise that I was just in denial about being trans! Of course, we're both different people so I don't wanna come across as knowing you better than yourself, but for me at least I just really had to take some time to really reflect on how I truly felt to come to this conclusion. I hope everything goes well for you,  whatever conclusion you come to!
Be who you are. FYP
You’re saying a lotta non cis stuff friend. A lot of the time this is how it starts. Do some searching and see what you find.

Also: we’re not all gals. Non binary people, trans men and trans masc people also live here ;)
OP, you very likely might not be cis. Do feminine ways of expression give you euphoria? Do you get a *deeply* personal fluttering feeling when you see lesbian romances portrayed in media? There is something deep within you that seems to be yearning for who you *are*— not what you are not.
I felt the same before my egg cracked and it confused me a lot as it seemed physically impossible and makes no sense. I could never imagine a relationship as a guy and wished to re reborn as a girl, but still took time until out figured out to be trans.
I was a cis girl who was really into gay men. But like, that didn’t make sense because I wasn’t gay, and I wasn’t a man. I couldn’t be into men in a gay way if I was a cishet girl right?? 

Now I’m a trans bi man. So like… you know. 

Tbh what started the whole thing for me was the way I really liked Yaoi and mlm stuff in fandom spaces. I was 10-16 and felt gross and bad, and thought I was fetishizing gay men. Yeah turns out, I wasn’t. I just didn’t know I was a man who was fantasizing. 

Fantasizing =\= fetishizing as it turns out. 

I also felt bad when I tried to date girls because I didn’t like girls the way other girls did. I didn’t want to be in a lesbian relationship, I wanted to be in a straight relationship. Which again: didn’t make sense because I was a cishet girl. 
Ha

Ha 

Hahaha

Hahahahahahhahahahahahahahhaha 

Anyway, maybe hang around here and the egg subreddit for a bit. Explore yourself, and what gender and your identity mean. Maybe you’re a cis man that just wants to embrace femininity. Maybe you’re a trans woman. Maybe you’re none of the above. Maybe you just like the stereotypical dynamics in a wlw relationship vs others. Who knows? You gotta explore the path before you find your destination.
I felt the same way, realised I'm non-binary.
r/egg_irl
Remindme! One year
If there was a button that turned you into a woman would you press it
Looks like the good advice is covered so

🥚 EGG
I believe that the fact that you posted this on r/trans means that you have an idea of what the real issue is here. From what I’m seeing, all the comments are saying that you should reevaluate being a cis man, but these opinions are heavily biased since you’re asking the trans community. I suggest maybe asking the lesbian community and seeing what they think.

TL:DR: get more opinions from different communities, instead of just asking the one that is going to give you the answer you wanna hear.
I went from feeling like a girl who’s envious of mlm relationships, to a gay boy, to a bisexual man, now to someone who feels both male and female at different points and is mostly attracted to women. Gender and sexuality are crazy journeys sometimes that don’t completely make sense but it’s a ride worth taking if you’re safe to!
I once thought the same way and now I am a gay man. Sounds like it might be worth exploring properly the possibility of transitioning, even if that's socially.
Wait… I saw your post on another sub! [insert Spider-Man meme template here]
Im sorry but youre VERY LIKEY not cis bro
I dont get to decide that kinda thing, but you should probably look into that (especially cos you CAN be a woman in a wlw release!)
that's how I was not too long ago. Honestly most of the people here too. what you're feeling isn't unheard of and we understand you. maybe draw what you would want to be like then little by little take steps to get there? just don't be unrealistic with it like completely different face shape, eye shape Ect...  you will discover your true self and feel beautiful one day it's just a process. hang in there it'll be worth it 💞
Hehe *nudges arm* not trying to say you are or aren’t anything but uh sounds like you might be trans lol. Maybe not but sounds like you are! If you ever need any help or support please reach out!
I am in a Relationship with a man and transition slowly makes me into a lesbian so...that's fun
You are now a lesbian. Congratulations!
tbh i was confused why i always felt like i was supposed to be gay or queer but as a girl.       well now im a queer aroace so  yeah. 

btw you are definitely not a creep, its a pretty normal thing for trans people to think that. i would guess youre probably not a cis guy. but if you aren't a girl, theres always demigirl and non binary (well demigirl counts as non binary but you get my point) there are more options and its really liberating finding yourself
This sounds like me before I realized I was mtf. Now, I'm not necessarily saying you ARE trans, that's for you to figure out. What I am saying is that this seems like a pretty big sign of it, given my very personal experience. Literally everything you've said there is stuff I thought, the lesbian part, the women's clothes part, the creep part, all of it. Just be you, do some soul searching and figure out who you are. Good luck and godspeed.
Ah yes. The absolutely manly and cis urge to be a lesbian
I resonate with this a lot, I'm more fluid than solely wanting to be a girl but I'm really struggling atm because I like girls and feel like a girl sometimes but also a guy. I'm just really really confused
Just saying, the feelings you're having are exactly the feelings I had when I was a teenager that eventually led me to realizing I was trans. 

Being trans doesn't have to be a negative, dysphoria-centered thing. For a lot of people, myself included, desire is more important than lack when it comes to gender. It's a beautiful thing.
Yeah I went down this path just the opposite, I literally said for years I’m a gay man traps inside a girls body smh. Hope you can find your true self and live your truth ❤️.
I remember thinking the same way with mlm relationships and thinking I was fetishising gay relationships and felt creepy doing it
Hey! I have been feeling the same way for years and rationalised it as having a 'better masculinity' than my peers (super humble!). Turns out that new improved masculinity was my feminity! Can't say definitely the same for you but turns out I'm some vibe of transfemme.
I really relate to this. I was born female, and thought I was a lesbian for the longest time. However, I have never related to lesbians. I didn’t feel like I actually belonged in that category. Something was off… but I was definitely attracted to women and fem people. Last year I realized I was trans and it all made sense.
This was something I was battling with back when I thought I was cis, turns out I'm actually a trans woman. I used to get so sad and worked up because it was ""something I could never have"" and was worried I was fetishising lesbians when what I really had an issue with was my own gender. Hope my experience can help you figure out how you feel etc.
Have you considered that maybe you in fact ARE trans and just haven't explored the idea?
You’re either a closeted lesbian (aka a trans woman) or you’re genderfluid
You may just want to be with a masculine or dynamically dominant woman. Sometimes that feeling can make you feel like you have to be a woman to be in that situation because of social roles. 

You can be in a straight relationship that ""feels queer"" by nature of the woman being the dominant and leading one, it's how my relationship dynamic works and I love it.

Do also remember that men can dress femininely, your gender doesn't dictate your clothing
The feeling like a creep thing is so true.

One of the best feelings about transitioning happened around 2 years in, when I was chatting with a girl I know about lesbian-themed novels and graphic novels and movies. She reads/watches them too, and she's a lesbian, and we just talked all about our favourites and swapped recommendations and so on, and it felt like the opposite of creepy, it was like empowering, like as consumers of this content we were supporting a community of creators we respect and identify with. I wasn't appropriating anything, nor misusing it or whatever, I was literally smack in the centre of its target audience. And a big chunk of internalized transphobia just slid away, like melting ice falling off the roof in springtime (sorry, I'm Canadian, lol).  It was like, wtf, WHY was I ever ashamed by this? (Rhetorical question, don't answer, lol.)
I remember waaaay back in high school a friend would joke that they were a lesbian trapped in a mans body. I never laughed at that one. It pretty much described me, and felt way too close to home. Somehow I suspected I was trans back then, but chose not to act on it.

A quarter century later I'm transitioning, and that dude's still one of my best friends.
Been there done this exact thought process, best of luck on your journey. We are always here and willing to talk if you want to. Slide someone adm I'm sure they would be happy to help you.
this ride seems like the best worst ride im about to have. thnaks
“I’m a cis girl, why do I feel like I attracted to men in a gay way???” 

Years later: “…oh.”
Oh geeze, I remember the days of denial and confusion.  So glad they're behind me now.
Yeah same here. You definitely do not sound cis, OP.
Not the OP, but looked into that link and I think some kind of egg cracked a little. I'm gonna look more into it
This website was a much needed wake-up call for me. I’d searched up stuff before that never really helped at all, but this actually got me to think for the last few hours about everything up till now and helped to solidify my feelings.

I’ve heard of the Gender Dysphoria Bible before, but this was the first time actually looking into it and understanding what it really was. Thank you so much for sharing this.
Didn't know that was a thing
I don’t know if OP will see this, but I’ve long worried about being creepy and as it turns out it’s because my dysphoria tells me that the body I was born with is digesting and revolting so OF COURSE anyone would be creeped out if I thought they were attractive. 

Yeah, dysphoria is a bitch
aghh, I do feel like the label of a ""lesbian"" really resonates with me but jeshfnossajd idk I feel like I wont ever be able to date anyone because of this and its a sad reality to never experience that kind of love. I also feel jealous when I see lesbian couples too. Im kind of obsessed over it as a guy and I feel like a wierdo, yknow...?

best of luck girl, hope you find love too
funny enough I have a therapist that is good with this kind of stuff, she is the thing that makes me keep going, I like her so much! and what do you exactly mean by self reflection?
Me too, really I think allowing myself to recognize that feeling (2yrs ago) was the first major crack, even though I didn't really hatch until recently
🥲

denial and dobut suck but idk maybe you are right, I could have asked a lesbian community or something
it does explain some things, I wish I could be a woman but it seems out of reach and im in denial, I know I am in denial and I cant stop.
>Try exploring alternative gender expressions

currently I just tried skirts and face app ^((which i loved using)) and tbh I think I should also try makeup painting nails and other stuff but I dont knoooooowww... where to get that or to use it so fuck.
they make good memes lol discovered them some time ago
thank youuuuuu
>""If everything in my life goes well, and I am at my happiest, where will I be in 10 years?""

prolly would have transitioned... -.- 

And yeah It would be scary at first to live a life where so many things change but, I strive for those changes, I want to have them. The questioning stage sucks but I feel that the only thing that is holding me back is the denial of the denial of the denial.
HOYL FUCK IM BOUT TO CRY YOU ARE SO SWEEEEEET 

I relate to the first paragraph a lot, currently im realizing that if I keep waiting for what I want to happen to magically happen, it wont happen. I have to bite the bullet and keep working to realize who truly is the person inside my body.
yeah I have a slight feeling i might be a woman hahah
im starting to feel like a dude less and less as time passes, im just stuck in this limbo of not feeling like anything.
lmao is my life a transgender allegory
What is the first step?
thnaks, it feels so nice to have access to communities like this that are so supportive!
wait what?? is this so close to how you feel as a transfem?
mogus
From what I heard a lot of them transitioned lmao.
ah sorry for using gals btw, didnt notice
Do feminine ways of expression give you euphoria? 

well I have not tried a lot yet but what I tried was so nice, I love dresses and lipstick now.

Also I have felt jealousy of plent of queer relationships but not straight ones, I waant what I caant have lmao
truly one of the moments of all time
I would have a existencial crisis in front of the button tbh
TL:DR: get more opinions from different communities, instead of just   
asking the one that is going to give you the answer you wanna hear.

thats actually I great idea, even if yall cant tell me anything about my identity Its nice to have the opinion of multiple groups and also idk I figured I would ask yall since I figured yall also felt like me at some point.
yeah I posted it here too because I thought no one would see it but lmao it blew up
I know right, I swear every cis guy I know wants to be a cute lesbian dating another cute lesbian and do cute lesbian things together
but the kind of relationships I am thinking of arent like a top or bottom kind of thing, it would be 2 fem presenting girls dating each other, not a inherently dominant and summisive dynamic. Also Im glad you have found the person that you love!  <3

btw I know men can dress fem, Ive done it myself and it was great!

(I have yet to try make up though -.-)
Yeah my attraction to women was always way different than my cis male peers. I was always crushing on the lesbian girls in hs. Realized it’s bc I’m lesbian lmaooo
Good luck dear egg! We’re here if you need us!
exactly haha but I promise you the good that comes is incomparable to anything you could ever imagine, it’s worth it and you have so many others going through the tougher parts with you, you’re not alone in this and you absolutely got this, even when it feels like you really don’t
Being trans is very difficult, but also very rewarding in my opinion. I love it, and wouldn’t change a thing
Definitely went through a similar struggle. Nearly every woman I dated before I came out was bi, and all my crushes were on bi or lesbian women. I just didn't realize that I was also a woman (despite some of the signs).

If you are interested in transitioning, any number of people on this sub can direct you to resources if you want.
Seconding this but its a painful ride that pays off in the end to live your best and honest life. Lots of love and welcome to the family
Gonna be the hardest but also most rewarding ride you will ever take
Sigh... No one explained this shit for me but god damn it the journey is a fucking trip without instructions.
:,) im glad
😅
Just finished reading it after someone recommended it on my own post and I am now 100% confident that in transgender. The bit where it said ""wanting to transition but being scared of being an ugly girl is, in itself, a form of dysmorphia"" thats the moment my egg cracked and I just started crying.
yes the OP and I feel the same way, I looked at it in other comment. shits relatable fr
You're welcome.  I'm glad it helped you. 💜
I did see it and I thank you for sharing your experience with me :,D 

and yeah I also so happen to have a low self esteem about my body so theres that
r/actuallesbians is super trans accepting and has done wonders for my own acceptance of my sexuality 🥰
mean if you want to be a lesbian women then you can go be a lesbian women XD

You'd probably have a hard time pre hrt in terms if dating but depending on where you are its nit impossible
There are definitely people out there who'll love you for you, trans or cis. I can confirm, I fell in love with my (trans) gf before she was able to pursue transition, and we're still very gay despite her having cracked my transmasc egg. Ignore anyone who says you can't find love if you're pre-transition, they're full of crap. And even if you're cis (which I have my doubts about), there's someone out there who'll see you and click with you and love you the way you want to be loved.

And you're not weird for wanting that. Wanting to be seen and loved in the way you want isn't weird or creepy or rude. It's you; being yourself is never a bad thing.
Jealousy doesn’t really sound like fetishizing, honestly. It sounds like you wish you could be a woman in a lesbian relationship, which… if that sounds appealing to you: you’re allowed. You can be a woman if you want to be. And you can be a trans lesbian.
The other people said it too but I wanna reiterate. There are people that would love to date you, and many would be happy with you at any point in a hypothetical transition. Personally my partner is pansexual. And there is no shortage of transfemmes who love other transfemmes. In fact we are a huge part of the community.
nah there's people who'll love you for you. I've been out as a trans guy for about 6 months and my bi gf has been nothing but supportive. as for myself, I'd say I'm exclusively into women but i have an openness to any desire or urge that may arise within myself at any time. I'm typically into more feminine traits, and I'd definitely date a trans woman even if the transition isn't over (maybe even not started, never happened before tho)
I’m sapphic af and have had the most amazing, wonderfully gay and loving experiences with other women. Being trans can seem scary in the romance department, but once you start loving yourself you see that being trans is actually hot af and an immeasurable amount of people, both cis and trans, agree wholeheartedly. You can, and I’m certain will, have the lesbian relationships you are dreaming of.
I live something similar, whenever I see lesbian couples my heart races, I feel envious and I wanna be in a wlw relationship because it looks so cute and I wanna cuddle and be cuddled. I don't know my true sexuality but this feeling makes me certain that I may be a lesbian together with other attractions I may have.
Oh good, I’m so glad! Keep talking with her. 

By self reflection I just mean continue thinking about yourself and what you want and who you are. A ton of us here relate extremely, extremely well to the experiences you’re writing about. Just saying. 

Also, [this article](https://genderanalysis.net/2017/06/depersonalization-in-gender-dysphoria-widespread-and-widely-unrecognized/) might be a useful read for you.
No I think you came to the right place. 

Denial is so hard because once you rid yourself of the lies the immeasurable guilt starts to set in. But don't let it get you down, what you're going through, everyone else here is too. 

Stay strong, stay educated, stay safe.
I cannot speak for cisgender men because I'm not one, but I get the distinct impression they don't question their gender.
Hey, that's okay! I spent months telling myself ""okay, I'm probably trans, but I don't think I can fully accept that right now."" It took a long time just letting the idea rattle around in my head before I really accepted it.

If you don't feel like you can internalize the idea right now, that is 100% valid. You can go about your day and think ""I might be a woman"" and then reject that idea for as long as you need to get to a place where it feels possible. (Or, you may decide after playing with the idea for a while that it's not quite right. Equally valid!)
The first step in dealing with denial is acknowledging it. Honestly, once you've done that I'm not sure it's still denial.
Amazon helps a lot when you aren't comfortable going out and buying stuff from a brick and mortar store.

YouTube has tutorials on pretty much anything you could ever want
The best ones 👌🏻
Np. And you highlight some of my old thought patterns. Take that as you will. 😉

Good luck to you sweetie.
No. It might, however, be trans *reality*.
The first step for me was coming out to myself. The second step was coming out to my friends and parents.

Still not out at work because my boss is openly pro-Putin which makes me wary of coming out to him. But looking for another job rn where I will hopefully be out.
Yeah this sub has been a big help since I've come to terms with my identity. It also helps to have some friends IRL that you know will be supportive. You don't have to tell them you're trans right away but if you determine they're someone you can trust you can ask them to start using non-gendered terms or feminine terms when talking to you. Such as compliments and pronouns. Let them know you're trying it out and you're not sure where you'll go with your journey but you trust them enough to have them with you on the way
Yeah. To spare you all the long boring details I felt this way for a while before I figured out I was trans. And yeah, I felt like a creep. 
But even if you haven’t had hrt, or surgery, you are still a woman, and there’s nothing wrong with that.
That’s alright! Non binaries and trans masc people are often brushed aside when it comes to trans discourse but they definitely deserve to be seen and feel valid!
A totally cis guy would probably run away from the button, or back away slowly to make sure he doesn't set it off
honestly same, lesbian women just happen to be the prettiest for some unknown reason ^((totally not feeling like a wierdo typing this))
I love youuuuuuuu ijsaldnssaj
thank you, I cant keep hiding for ever, I have to get out there and live life how it has to be lived!
Yeah, that's a biggie for a lot of people, including me.  For a humorous look at it, check out reallifecomics at  https://www.reallifecomics.com/comic.php?comic=june-29-2020 for when the author, Mae Dean, realized she was trans reading that exact line; the comic documents her transition.

And congratulations!  Welcome to the club, sweetie!  😁💜💋💋
[NightlingBug's Twitter thread](https://twitter.com/NightlingBug/status/1215716433210105856?t=aA89cTzUvRcSL6yW3vmNmg&s=19) also gives some good examples of how suppressed dysphoria feels.
...

(Sexual orientation crisis)

\>.<
If nothing else, you can find bi folk around.
I mean thinking about gay women stuff as the cis guy that I am def feels like fetishizing.  

>You can be a woman if you want to be

I want to but ughhh i dont know. my brain is stupid and i am too.
>And there is no shortage of transfemmes who love other transfemmes.

aww wait a t4t relationship seems like something so cute, one can only dream....
>By self reflection I just mean continue thinking about yourself and what you want and who you are. 

Ah good, I literally cannot stop doing that at all so go me I guess!

>A ton of us here relate extremely, extremely well to the experiences you’re writing about. Just saying.

Well it is kinda strange that over 200 trans people related to my experience as a cis guy.... probably doesnt mean anything ^((it fucking does doesnt it))
what would you think it would be then? fear?
And honestly, the cashiers at the store probably do not give a single fuck (they’re not paid enough to care what you’re buying). And if anyone gives you any crap you can always claim you’re getting a gift for your girlfriend or sister or niece or something.
yeah they definetly do, they are some of the best friends you can get
rlly? being a girl seems perfect
You’re not stupid. Not even remotely. Right now it just sounds like you’re questioning your gender identity. Nothing is wrong with that. I don’t know how long you’ve been thinking about this, but maybe arranging a consultation with a gender therapist could help parse out your thoughts.
>(it fucking does doesnt it)

Yeah girl, it probably does.
Can confirm lol. I wasn't a cashier, but when I worked retail I gave less than zero shits about what people where putting in their carts and mostly just hoped they wouldn't talk to me.
It is if that's what you age. I was in your position a couple of months back, and didn't realise how constantly bad I felt until after presenting as a girl (whatever that means to you: wearing skirts, shaving, using she/her, wearing a padded bra (this is the most for me))
Whenever I see this idk whether to celebrate or break down. It's such a hard time not only coming to terms with all this crazy shit, but deciding embracing it is the only way forward. 

No dream worth pursuing is easily obtained, I suppose.
I know right??? idk if I should feel happy about it or if I should feel pathetic for it... all I know is that its what I want and whether it sucks or not matters but thats other thing
You definitely shouldn’t feel pathetic. All of this is part of the process. 

If it makes you feel better, getting through the denial was by far the hardest part for me. Everything tends to become easier when you finally accept yourself. It’s the constant questioning that was the real torture.
I understand these feelings and still have them sometimes. But sometimes I step out the front door in that skater dress that sways just right, and those heels that make my feet look cute, and I strut with long strides, head up and back straight...like I own the world. 

And most of the time I'm just in my pajamas like ""I'm just here for milk and eggs""
> It’s the constant questioning that was the real torture.

IT REALLY IS!!!!!! my questioning has burnt me out in a way ive never even experienced, I havent experienced a lot of my life yet so that was close to a rock bottom for me.  You never really stop thinking about it at all and it becomes the background music of your head. The background music that midly hurts your ears and plays for days, week, months...

I want to isolate myself and to stop living life how I used to live it and I did that for some months (it wasnt fullfilling) but I have to get the fuck up now. I cant stop living because if I do I will never achieve to be what I want to be.
I feel that. It was so all consuming when I was 11-13 that my brain just eventually shut down and I was in perma-disassociation mode for the next 20 years. Completely lost any sense of who I was. Breaking free from that was the single greatest experience of my life. It was like I had been drowning my entire life without even knowing it, and then I finally got to breathe air for the first time. I’ll never forget that feeling.
im so happy you did it, you are someone strong. dont forget that"	10c4eig	trans	308	0.96	2023-01-14 23:42:20
[Vent] Cis people just don't fucking get it.	"I'm closeted trans fem. I was shopping with a friend in dangerfield the other day and I saw a cute skirt I liked, I mentioned how I wish I could wear it and the conversation went like this. 

""Why can't you?""  
""I wouldn't have the confidence for it""  
""Yeah it took me the time to adjust to wearing weird clothes as well""(She has a very 'extravagant' dress style)  
""It's more I wouldn't feel safe either""  
""I know what you mean. My ex is trans, I remember I always wondered how she could go out by herself so confidently""  
""Yeah, I just couldn't do it""  
""I find it sort of beautiful though, how she could""

That's not word for word but the general gist of it. She just doesn't fucking get it. I don't want it to be beautiful, i don't want to struggle for ths. I just fucking want to be happy.

I don't want to fight this war, I don't want to cry when i look at myself in the mirror. I don't want to be terrified inside my own fucking home because I don't know how my roommates are with trans people.

I just want to be happy. 

I want to wear clothes that I like.

I want to smile when I see a mirror.

I want to head out with friends and laugh. 

I want to hear someone call me by my name.

All the years spent suffering through this, all the nights I've spent alone, and all those that are yet to come. It's not a beautiful thing to overcome. I just want to be happy."	"It kind of feels like you're projecting your dysphoria based depression onto her.

Of course cis people don't get us, they can't.

But she seems very open and accepting and seems like she was talking about how it's a beautiful world when people can just be themselves.

Not as a reality, but as a concept.

It's not easy for us, and it's likely not going to get better any time soon. But it's also not fair to project our frustrations onto people who don't deserve it. We have too many enemies to alienate the allies that we have.
I know it’s frustrating, but at least she is trying to understand and be supportive. I would look at it like that. The individuals around me still won’t stop deadnaming and intentionally misgender me. It’s true that they don’t understand us and probably never will but I’ll take your friend any day over the fake friends and extreme homophobia and transphobia that is probably more common. Maybe just explain that you don’t care about the beauty, you just want to be happy. Maybe it will open her eyes to a new reality about trans individuals. Still sounds like a good friend if I’m being honest. Hell at this point, I would take someone using the correct name besides two doctors I see. Maybe it’s something to think about and food for thought kind of thing.
I get you. I'm from a red state and surrounded by ""friends"" that don't understand the actual fear and anxiety we get to deal with constantly. They ""know"" but they don't actually understand it, I don't think they want to.

My guess is it's the same reason we wish we didn't have to deal with it...it's draining, exhausting, scary, and such a burden to stay happy through. They just have the option to ignore it so they take it without thinking. 

It's OK to feel frustrated with the situation. It's OK to vent about the apathy of others making our lives unnecessarily difficult. There will be a ton of people who will not ""get it"" and we have to accept reality, even if it shouldn't be that way.

 I manage by guarding my heart closely around fake friends. Instead, finding others I can truly think of as family to confide in.
Our cis allies see our struggle as poetry. It's so beautiful to read about it. It's an aesthetic to them. They can put a sticker on their car and say that they support us and be praised and put on display. While we remain the underbelly. It's not an aesthetic for us. It's a never ending up hill climb on a mountain that wants us dead. Some are killed. Some jump. Either way, it's a sisyphian task. They will never understand.
It’s not that cis people don’t get it. You’re friend has never been a targeted minority. 
I’m cis and a targeted minority. I’m a plurality, I have alters. I don’t dare tell people I have alters because they might think I have psychosis cause dissociative disorders are so misunderstood. It’s dangerous for me to tell a Police Officer that I am an Australian Aboriginal, I might wind up dead, even though I’m white passing. 


It shouldn’t be your job to educate the ignorant but sometimes you need to lead the horse to water and hope it drinks… 
Up until a few weeks ago, I wasn’t aware of what America and the UK was doing because I live under my own little rock in Australia, not really well connected to the outside world cause my algorithm decided I needed mental health awareness and animal pictures instead of world news…  
My trans loved one, mtf had to tell me what was going on. They didn’t particularly want to because of the trauma it gives them just thinking about it, but I am so thankful they did tell me what was going on. 
Cause I now have the tools to better support them.

I actually understand you a lot more than you’d think. 


I also understand how it’s not safe at home. I grew up with a Narcissistic father. Even as a cis woman I couldn’t wear what I wanted, I couldn’t have my hair how I wanted. I’ve been doing what I want with my hair since 2018. I’m moved out of home, but whenever I go back to visit, the comments about how I dress or the way my hair is, gets to me. “You look trashy, You look like a dike.” Mean hurtful things like that. My parents don’t know I’m bi. 

And I bet you, there are plenty of other cis people out there who understand you, more than you actually know. 
Just cause a few cis people don’t understand doesn’t mean we all are to be lumped together in that category.
My mom told me that I should identify as female (I’m FtM) because THE ANCESTORS DO NOT APPROVE.
There are a lot of insightful comments here. Thought I'd add another way to look at it. 

The comment of ""it being beautiful "" can also come from a point of envy ( I don't know about this friend, but it sparked something akin in me). I was afab, though identify as bigender, and growing up and living as a woman/girl can also create an underlying fear regarding how you express yourself and where you spend time. If you are unlucky, you can get really hurt, and the narrative is that it was probably your own fault.

Seeing or hearing about someone being themselves can give me a feeling of 'if I was braver, I could also do that'
But maybe this is all mixed in with my dysphoria, so what do I know.. ^^' Though when talking about my fear to my cis woman friend, it felt like she really understood at least part of it.
I second what the other comments are saying. It isn’t as if she’s being rude and insensitive to you, and it’s actually kind of cruel of you to expect her to understand something that she simply cannot.
It gives me a weird feeling in my stomach when I see people criticize Allie’s for just saying something that could be perceived as a little rude, even when they don’t know any better and they have good intentions with it. Yeah that’s a kinda backhanded thing to say, but that doesn’t mean they’re not an ally or they’re not trying to be supportive. Cis people won’t understand everything about being trans, and that’s fine. They don’t need to. Only you do. All we can do is teach them what is right and what is wrong so they can understand better. Instead of venting about your friend being transphobic or something, tell them what they did wrong and show them how to be better.
Why do you expect them to? They don’t experience dysphoria or being trans or whatever. It’s kinda like expecting someone to understand trauma they’ve never been through before
They simply can't possibly understand how we feel/see it - the same as how we can't feel/see how they view it...

Also - the struggle with this is so true!  But let me tell you - its so easy once you do it. I was scared to death!  When I came out at work I was scared sooooo bad to dress feminine. My staff kept telling me to just do it but I hesitated. Then one day I did it outside of home and I was so surprised to learn that no one cared. Then I tried it to work and omg that day was so bad - I couldn't focus on anything - instead I walked around all timid, and tried to cower in my office as much as I could. Something came up causing me to go help someone and I did. I got her squared away and then she said ""omg I've your style!"" And we got to talking...then I seemed to be over it entirely after that. 

I hope you find the courage and free yourself. It is liberating, and eventually its just 2nd nature.
Your feelings here are absolutely legit.  It sucks that we live in fear.  It sucks that such simple things are such an awful struggle.  None of us asked for the hate, the constant fighting.  And I presume your situation is bad, because you are still in the closet.

I think your friend here is trying to help you by giving you the support she knows you probably aren’t getting.  If I were in her place, I wouldn’t say things that were *too* much different.  I think you are right, the “it was beautiful she had the confidence to do it” comment is a little misplaced.  It’s a pretty cis thing to say.  but the idea I think she’s trying to convey here is “if you buy and wear that skirt, I will support you”.  I’d have said something different there, but my core message would have been the same.

This person is a good friend.  Yeah, she may not understand everything, but she is trying to help you build confidence by communicating that you have support.  I get why this might, by it’s very nature, fuck you up emotionally. as you are suppressing your needs every day, and here she is making it sound like it’s easy.  but… I think she actually does understand that it isn’t, or she wouldn’t have said what she said.  She’s just communicating that notion indirectly and subtly.

it’s good to let other people in.  You can be upset with her and feel alone, or you can cry about it on her shoulder and have company, right?  This friend of yours cares.  This friend wants to help.  She probably doesn’t understand everything, but I think she might understand more than you are giving her credit for right now.
Wait I’m confused, are you out as trans to this friend?
So sorry, I am one of those not fully understanding cis people. And I wish I could just make things better. That’s why we say stupid stuff. Keep telling us off. I don’t have solutions.
Imagine a world where being trans wasn't questioned.
I appreciate your ability to accurately write about these feelings. I just try to think about where to start and feel like exploding by like minute 3 of trying to articulate myself.
Yeah it is tough I've had the same problem in terms of not knowing who I can come out to at least. But I went and asked political questions with trans related ones with my friends (my really close friends) I have found out are transphobes. Friends I have further away geographically aren't but I knew that early on and I've come out to. Concerning the friend who you were out shopping with she seems supportive at least but I also get the impression she does not quite understand it and may need you to explain to her the problems you face in a bit more detail. Otherwise with your roommates it might be worth doing that little political questions trick I did interspercing the questions you really want to ask subtle like. For example I talked about trans gender people in general whilst also commenting to my friends about the current political situation, I also talked about Brianna Ghey, I'm in UK, so use a local newstory of something to get the ball rolling there. But don't push it if they don't want to talk as if they are transphobic you don't want to out yourself and put yourself in danger unnecessarily. Hopefully you'll be able to figure out where they stand. Hope this helps!
Honey, ALL I Can Say Is....NO! MOST Cis people don't get it.  They Never Will Get It....All you can do is the best you can do.  I lived in that deep dark closet for over 65 years. I've been out a year.  It Was Scary.( you mention Dangerfield, is that Texas?).  I'm 74, M2F, on HRT 6 months, live and dress openly as a woman 24/7, and have several female friends, and a boyfriend, and yes, he and I have sex.  I wear pretty much whatever I want.  I don't try to be or dress like a 20 or 30 something, but I don't dress like a old granie either.  Make no mistake, I'm scared.  Texas is NOT a trans friendly state. I don't hide who or what I am. ALL of my lady friends know I'm trans.  

Sweetheart, I cry all the time. There's no real answer for our situation.  

Just Keep Smiling. Hugs and Kisses,

Michele
Yeah I seen it the way you did. She seems very open and supportive.
How is there projection or alienation by OP there? OP just feels what they feel, is venting, and it doesn’t seem clear that their roommates are allies.
""One must imagine Sisyphus happy..."" otherwise life would be too depressing to continue.
[deleted]
Trans, and plural here (DID).  Very well put.
…
Kinda what I'm also taking away here. Reminds me of a comic I'd seen wherein someone posts a status of ""I'm mad!"" and then proceeds to just get mad at people for asking what was wrong. 

Like, it's totally fair to feel lost and alone. It sucks! But don't get upset at those who try to empathize.
I think they meant OPs friend sounds like a good ally, not the roommates. 

Being realistic, no human being on earth can ever possibly know what it's like to be in another human being's shoes. There is no singular ""trans experience"" any more than there's a singular ""cis experience"". There will always be misunderstandings and all we can do is find ways to cope when and where we can, trying not to judge ourselves or the people around us too harshly. If we can find good friends, we should try to hold onto them. But friends will never fully understand. This doesn't mean they don't care, though.
Genuinely, why did you focus on the cis aspect rather than the intersectionality of the oppression of marginalized groups? Isn’t that the meat of the comment to OP?
We say thank you. (Co-fronting).
Will you please send the link to that comic?
I was referencing where they mentioned allies being alienated at the end. There isn’t enough information in that first post for me to think of the OP’s friend as a current ally to trans people, but it may be different for others. I don’t agree that there was projection or alienation from OP evidenced by their initial post. It’s just venting, like they said. We don’t know that they did more than that.

Yes, we all have different sets of experiences. No, we shouldn’t judge friends too harshly, but it really does not seem like OP was doing that. And if they don’t know how their roommates are around trans people, that’s a valid concern.
[deleted]
Quite welcome!
The roommates are definitely a valid concern. I don't think anybody said anything to suggest otherwise. And it's totally okay to vent, it's just that there's always going to be misunderstandings between friends. Nothing wrong of course with being frustrated by this, though. I can see OP's point that it can be difficult to have a friend who just doesn't get what it's like to be trans, especially since transgenderism has become ""trendy"" among cis people for virtue signalling lately. 

There's a movie called A Fantastic Woman that I think cis people should watch to get a basic idea of the daily lived experiences of a trans woman. The movie really does a great job at showing the daily realities that a trans person might face that cis people generally wouldn't have to worry about, and the lead was a trans actress.
Okay how would you better suggest my host go about trying to objectively show that perhaps why OP’s friend doesn’t understand and give supporting evidence if not based off my host’s own RL experiences? 


My host is Autistic and was only trying to support both sides. It’s what she does. Honestly, she didn’t have to comment. But you also don’t know what was going through my Hosts mind when she did. She’s very loving and very caring and only wanted OP to know that there are cis people who know and understand. She was trying to show her support and here you are tearing her down for it. Good job.
Fair enough. I read it as, “hey while I’m not trans, here are some things that I have experienced that allow me to better empathize with you and understand where you’re coming from. Other cis people will be in similar situations to empathize more than you’re currently feeling so don’t write everyone off just yet because I’m glad my trans friend didn’t when they could have because of my ignorance.” Again, just how I interpreted it. Thanks for taking the time to answer my question!
I just saw your edit. That’s a good point too.

Of course, sorry if I sounded defensive. I’m used to getting into trans related arguments on Reddit, so I was kinda on edge lol. I’m sure it can be read the way you did, but the way it was worded sounded off to me is all.
This is exactly how it was intended to be read. My host says Thank you. I thank you too. I apologise for answering for her she didn’t feel like dealing with confrontation with her current head space. She read Carcino’s comment and shut down.
Autistic people take from their own experiences it’s how they learn to emphasise with others. 


My host does understand what it’s like to be “trans in a sense.” It’s how she ended up with 7 male alters. The short of it: she longed to be a boy cause a boy wouldn’t have to go through the abuse she sustained. She didn’t know about transgender she was a kid in the 90’s. So her mind manifested a way for her to be just that. So hello from 2 of 7 (borg reference intended).


She didn’t want to use that as an example cause she didn’t want to trauma dump on OP’s post, but she wanted OP to know cis people do understand. 


I will admit her language skills suck when she’s upset. OP didn’t upset her she’s going through things. 


She also didn’t assume OP’s friend was or want a targeted minority she took an educated guess from the little information OP provided, again applied her Autistic overlay (it’s default), drew from her RL experiences and went from there. 


Technically you took your own experiences and did the same to my host. 


She doesn’t want me to fight with you and she doesn’t want to cause anyone issues in this sub. She will take onboard your suggestions and try better next time. She just really wanted you to know she wasn’t doing what you accused her of doing. 


I co-front/host with her, she shut down after reading your comment and wanted me to address it. She’s also really sorry for offending you, or anyone else. 

We both hope you have a good day/evening.
No need to apologize! I def did not want to argue. Thank you for sharing your perspective. I can definitely see your interpretation too.
I’m just a random person on the internet, please don’t apologize to me. I don’t think y’all are bad people, and I understand that /I/ was the one that read your comment wrong. Please don’t take my advice, and continue to pull from your situations to relate to people. If people misunderstand, that’s their problem. It was certainly mine in this situation. I’m glad we had this conversation, I know better now. Good luck to y’all, have a great day."	12an3hc	trans	297	0.88	2023-04-03 15:01:31
My last purge	"So im in my 40s, and over the years I have gone through the purge phase several times. When you ""make the decision"", to not do this anymore and get rid of everything you've got that is for that other part of yourself. Cause it's not real anyway and you don't need or want it.

But this time I've been out and actively transitioning for over a year.
My dresser is full of clothes and I'm sure many don't match who I want to be.. I case you're wondering im AMAB. So I go through my sock drawer and get small pile of socks and underwear that don't match anymore. As i go through the rest of the dresser I find 2 shirts that don't match. 

To my surprise with exception of a few socks, I've already purged him out of my life, and I couldn't be happier with myself.  

Don't get me wrong he was a nice guy and he will be missed, just not by me.

Never again will I feel the need to hide myself, my dresses, or makeup. 

Now if I'm getting rid of a dress or shirt, it's to make room for another dress or shirt that I think is prettier.

Just wanted to share."	"Congrats! That confidence and commitment is commendable! 

I look forward to being there some day as well...

Thanks for being a little inspiration in my life!
Bravo and I am so glad for you!
Good for you! I'm obsessing about mtf and found myself subconsciously getting rid of male clothes and going more androgynous!
It's such a liberating feeling, isn't it? I'm currently in the process of purging my past as well and when I see all the new feminine things I have now, it really helps me realize that yes, this isn't a dream. This is real. And while I still don't pass, I'm trying my best to remain hopeful as I continue to try and purge every last reminder of who I pretended to be for so long.
I've attempted to purge twice since I began HRT nearly 8 months ago. It's all I know. It's the way that I have dealt with my identity my whole life. The difference is, now I have my wife, doctor, and therapist all refusing to let me quit. Going back is no longer an option.
Sehr gut mate, i wish i could be free but that time has yet to come, im still abit christian ig but im going MtF and hope to get an appointment with my family doc to start the journey as my bumpy ride has only begun. Btw for those christians whom are transphobic (my parents) God loves all, including the LGBT community."	mki3hp	trans	293	0.99	2021-04-05 11:07:15
In Defense of UWU culture, or How I learned to stop worrying and embraced the NYA	" 

(trigger warning, for serious discussion of transphobia and transphobic language as well as some language) 

I have noticed on many trans online spaces, some serious scoldy criticism against anime style catgirl/uwu culture that many internet transfemmes treasure and post regularly. I understand the criticisms are obvious and intuitive to many, that a lot of anime culture is problematic and overly sexualised in an often creepy way. However, something within the spirit of uwu, yet lights the hearts of countless trans with a feeling like hope. A feeling not explained in words, and I wish to do my best to serve the catgirl nation, to find those words, to defend the subculture that has proven such a balm to my jaded broken heart. 

I want to start my argument with historical western culture. I want to start with an anecdote referencing trans youtuber May’s amazing video essay on the western 80’s slasher, Sleepaway Camp. The TLDR version, is that it is a profoundly transphobic film, where the final line at the end of the movie, is the “horrific” reveal that the female presenting slasher, has male genitalia, shouting “SHEs a DUDE!” even within the safe context of a trans video essay, this scene was painful to watch. 

The interesting take on this movie, is not pointing out all the many, many ways this movie is offensive, but in the strange way that May, and I as her audience, took strange inspiration from the movie. May projects an interpretation where a kind, innocent and really cute trans girl gets epic violent revenge on “victims” who for the most part, are really abusive and mean to her. It is likely a symptom of how microscopic popular trans representation is, and how DESPERATE us trans are, to find something inspiring in any image that vaguely reminds us of ourselves. Even if the movie is made to be awful to us, May is so jaded, she just wants to find some joy in a cute looking trans character getting revenge on assholes. I relate to that level of cynicism and emotional exhaustion.

Of course, popular western culture has progressed since the 80’s, the president can say “trans rights” and a good looking enough tran can give those particular kind of “inspiring” speeches that suburban white people in auditoriums like. It appears like we might be getting a lick, a slight hint at possible full social acceptance, and with that, comes the temptation to try to fit in with popular society. But, and this is a big but, where is the “positive” trans representation in western culture right now? What TV character embodies someone that a young transfemme today, feels is inspiring and relatable, or dare I even suggest, sexy or cool? 

This is my own anecdotal experience, but the last trans representation I saw in western TV was a chick who got murdered on a cop show, and some family drama where an ugly tran was kind of a bitch (not in a cool way) and caused problems for the main cast. Oh yea, and during Halloween I saw Leprechaun in the Hood where a trans character was brutally murdered as well for laughs. Then there are characters like Nia Nal in supergirl, who are explicit pander characters who make me cringe in a way deeper and grosser than anime ever has. Such characters are examples of pure astroturfing. (for the young uns, astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.) 

Which finally brings me to the main subject of this little manifesto. Anime. anime has a lot of trans representation (compared to the popular west.) Whether its the adventurer girl in “that time I got turned into a spider” or Tanya in “The story of Tanya the Evil” or that noble knight in “Magical Girl Raising Project.” They are written naturally into the stories not to make a political statement, but because the authors, many of which are cis male, felt that such characters served the story they wanted to tell. Sometimes those representations are problematic, often they are overly sexualised. But there IS representation, lots of it, evil characters, good characters, tragic and comedic, from “Stop!! Hibari Kun!” to serious discussion of self harm and suicide in “JJ Macfield and the Ilsand of Memories” (which is a masterpiece as far as I am concerned.) 

In Anime, trans poeple are not just “valid”, or “inspiring” but are as full people as the rest of the cast, and you can find them as heroes villains and everything in  between, you can find them modest or as total uwu sex fiends. As a young tran, you can choose from an actual diverse menu of characters to relate to, something not easily said elsewhere. Hell, here in the west contemporary trans are motivated to stan for the fucking sleepaway camp slasher because representation is literally that scarce and shitty. 

Which takes me back to Sleepaway camp. A lot of people in popular culture, especially outside the circles of well to do proggressive types, cringe at the existence of trans people, even today. Many cis poeple find us disgusting, strange, dangerous, the subjects of horror movies. I want to draw a connection, between the way many of those same bigots turn their noses with disgust and contempt towards overly sexualised anime women, is literally the same reaction they give to depictions of ANY kind of trans women. Because they see trans women as devient sex objects. Please consider how a trans femme might see Felix Argyle, or that anime about the tran who lives in boy mode, but puts on a skirt and makeup when they activate their magic “save the world” smartphone app (and looks cute doing it.) Consider how much their projection is amplified 10 fold when their bullies and political enemies cringe the same way at their fictional heroes as they do against them personally.

Consider the art style itself, how the abstraction and lack of detail in anime faces obscures many of the details that trans feel super inescure about, and that when a tran appears in anime, even problematic representations, like the waitress from Persona or whatever, *they get to look hot*, they get to be attractive and normal looking compared to other girls in anime. Think about how much we trans WANT that. We dont just want to be accepted, but most of us, dont want to rock the stubble and adams apple forever, we want to be conventionally attractive, those anime boobs are #transition goals, and that is both true, deeply emotionally intimate, and not a socially acceptable thing that your #trans ally joe biden can say out loud. 

Which brings me back to western culture, and the nature of our progressive “allies.” Yes, we have allies, and trans rights have improved, but for popular hegemonic society, I think any well lived tran understands how *conditional* that societal acceptance is. The proggressive caucus will accept certain kinds of de-sexualised, de-radicalised politically narrow representation of trans in a way that does not challenge capitalism,gender, or even our place in the society they are willing to give us some seat at the table for. Even then, acceptance and integration in such a culture often means implicitly selling out many of our sisters who are poor, indiginous, neurodivergent, or politically extreme. Popular progressive culture is a place we can survive, as long as we know our place, but it is not a place where we can feel safe.

For so many trans who spend all day, living in the most “presentable” way possible, trying their best to not get fired, or evicted, or be the subject of a cringe youtube clip used as a pretext by bigots to say horrible things to us (AKA Gamestop tran freakout.) So many of us want to a space to stop living in fear, to express our hidden emotions, our hidden desires, the things we feel and think that your mom wouldn't feel comfortable liking on a facebook post. 

Anime culture is a place for social outcasts. For better and for worse, all sorts of people who don't fit in, whether its neo nazis on 4 chan, and yes, young trans femmes, find something relatable in the depiction of an artistic culture that glorifies being an outsider. I think thats important, I think its essential that we have that kind of outsider culture amongst ourselves, at least within the internet for christs sake. 

A tran well versed in our history, must understand the role that Camp has played in queer culture. For those less well read, the camp movement is the ongoing artistic trend in dressing in intentionally gaudy and off putting old looking clothing and over the top makeup in order to challenge society and draw attention to standing out as an individual opposed to what normally looks “good” and “fashionable.” Most of what is recognizable in modern drag culture is derivative of Camp. The point is, that in the darkest most transphobic days of our history, Trans found each other, and inspiration and hope and solidarity in artistic movement of intentionally standing out and causing the normies to cringe. There is a reason that many of us find something inspiring in the famous Babs Johnson clip, “Kill everyone now! Condone first degree murder! Advocate cannibalism! Eat Shit!!!Filth is my politics! Filth is my life! !”

There is something noble in giving a finger to the society which has scorned us to make a point about their hypocrisy. That is important, sacred, meaningful. To me it means, “I will not live or judge myself by your rules fuckers” That kind of subversive inclusivity needs to be a part of our sub culture, or a bunch of atomsied trans are going to spend a lot of time living in terror of never being accepted outside of successfully “passing” not even just as a cis female, but as a socially normative kind of tran. 

Therefore, the fact that uwu culture makes many respectable types cringe, is an essential feature of why it is popular. If we were to as a community, replace it, it must be with a cultural language equally or even more offensive to the same sort of people. We must not become whitewashed. Because lets be absolutely clear that this is the de facto effect of appeals to cut down on the catgirl shit. The racial politics behind such appeals. In lieu of eastern anime style art as a uniter, the popular trans culture will not become inundated with diverse art styles and references to artistics movements from africa or south America. The anime replacement art will be overwhelmingly western, and overwhelmingly white. They may often depict dark skinned characters, but they will overwhelmingly be the proggressive western white persons idea of what a POC trans “should” look like, there will be less sexual creepiness, but there will be a lot less diversity of any kind at all. We all all become fucking Nia from supergirl, who writes Joe Biden speeches and thinks the CIA is cool. That's what such a conversion would ask of us to become. Who relates to that? The anti uwu folks, will claim they value diversity, but to claim the suppression of anime art will do anything  but increase the westernisation and anglocisation of our popular art, is a lie on its face. A delusional claim made in appalling ignorance or malicious bad faith. Honestly, if the only two genders of representation I get to choose from in my subculture are a horny cis japanese guy who thinks chicks with dicks are hot, and some weird journalism major who stans Joe Biden, I find the horny japanese guy way less gross and offensive. I feel less “used” by his theoretical maturbatory fantasies. And honestly, even the horny shit is often way more cool or interesting to watch than Jules from Euphoria. 

Which brings us finally, to the horny shit. To the deeply problematic way that a lot of anime tends to sexualize a certain kind of innocence that comes across as offesnively pedophillic or just plain infantilising to women in general. This accusation cannot be in wholesale denied, after all, Anime is an entire genre of art with  diverse depictions, many of which are just plain indefensibly awful and bad. But it would be a bad faith claim, to say that even the specific parts of anime culture that trans culture has idealised, like Astolfo or Felix Argyle, do not exemplify a certain kind of veneration of cutesy innocence.

Yet, I still would ask this of many western critics. “What is wrong in YOUR culture, where innocense and being cute, is tied so closely and exclusively to concepts of pedophilia or children. Why do western women have to put so much effort into masculinizing themselves and de sexualising themselves to be taken seriously as adults in male dominated fields?” As Natalie Wynn puts it, why do so many college girls take weird pride in dressing modestly, yet still going for a “sexy in a stacy kind of way?” What parts of yourself has your patriarchal culture asked you to suppress to be taken seriously? 

Do we not all want to be cute sometimes? To feel innocent sometimes? To feel sexy sometimes too, to go back and forth, to be both at once? Are not those part of the feminine experience and mood? Yes, I can be serious, and grim, and professional, and androgynous, but must I be such things all of the time? Cant I be a slut if I want? Cant I also be a church girl sometimes without being catcalled or judged? Cant I just be a complete fucking person who feels the full spectrum of human emotions in different contexts times and places? Are you not asking us to lobotomise half our souls, to cut off half the sky of our experience? Cant trans women just at least, suffer and embarass ourselves riding the razor edge of the madona/whore social complex half of cis women have to balance between? Cant the artistic representation of that have cat ears? A creature whose name has become culturally synonymous in the west with female anatomy? Why must trans women always be serious, mature and sexless? I am jaded, I am cynical, I am always presenting in the kind of business casual attire and attitude requested from post grad students. Cant I just give a soft uwu on the internet in a mournful hopeful contemplation of the lost girlhood I never got to experience? Why do I need to keep up the fucking business casual mindset even on the godamm internet? 

Im weird. A neurodivergent communist queer, I dont fit in to most places, but I like fitting in with the culture of people who say uwu to celebrate that they dont fit in the same way. I think its cool anime has some many non gender comforming characters, I like that the characters are cute, I want to look like that kind of, not just a little bit because comparing myself to real life cis women hurts in a way that it doesnt to compare myself to the abstracted drawings.

I think its heroic how the internet catgirls know they cause people to cringe, but are fearless in being seen and heard anywhere, I think its heroic they way they challenge social expectation, I think its heroic that they dare to express their desires to be cute, I think its heroic the way they provide a light beacon for other people who fit in, not even just trans, but other queers and non queer good hearted weirdos as well. I admire the catgirls, at their cringiest, at their most pathetic 100 times more than I can ever admire fucking Nia from Supergirl. And to really draw the ultimatum, those really are the only two options, the only two options with the cultural clout to compete for trans subculture hegemony for whatever that's worth. So I ask all you trans, especially the femmes, to look in your hearts and ask what your feelings are inspired by, what you want and what you want to be. Communist catgirl who makes people uncomfortable, or neoliberal sockpuppet who can speak in public, but can't be seen kissing anyone on TV. 

This is my final point, my takeaways from my lengthy pro catgirl manifesto about television, anime politics and gender. Coming out was hard, I was so ashamed of coming out and being seen as an “ugly girl.” Finding the catgirl shit online, was the moment I realised, “fuck, im not the only one, Im not alone.” I ask you this, without the catgirl shit, in our current culture and moment in 2021, what could you show that sad tran in boy mode to inspire her to be brave enough to be cringe? Not enough to “uwu” un public, but to transition to their friends and family, to show her that causing other people to be uncomfortable with you isn't the end of the world? To show her that being weird and wanting to be cute yet sexy is okay? If we were to vote Tabby the catgirl off our island, who would take her place? Uwu."	"You wrote a whole uwu essay, uwu

Honestly, as a neuro divergent technically bi, MtF politically unaffiliated, liberal progressive humanist that's obsessed with cuteness and loves cat girls, fox girls, and those cringy bits in anime that makes those people mad, I fully agree with this post, even though some of it did go over my head, I get the gist of it. Honestly uwu and nya culture is adorable and memetacular XD. There's a lot of people who identify with these characters and some even put on similar personas, and in some cases, fursonas. Honestly anime was my doorway into self discovery since my mom was one of the most over protective and controlling people I knew at the time. I didn't even know LGBTQ was a thing before I turned 14 and thought anime was cartoons like Danny phantom. I was such a lame ignorant normie back then doing my best to blend in cause I didn't know what was wrong with me or how best to describe it. Had LGBTQ people had more and better representation in western media I'd have learned what that feeling was far sooner. I had asked my friend if he ever wanted to be a girl and he looked at me taken aback with a surprised what? And I looked away nervous and said nvm it was nothing and left it well alone. I was 10 at the time and still had no clue what it was or why I felt the way I did. And anime helped guide me towards my answers indirectly, took me looking up some crossdressing anime characters and finding theories as to why they are the way they are, as well as anime like kamfer to find myself and discover what transgender was. Though it's a shame it took so long for me to figure things out. Then what lead me to learn about lesbians was Yuri anime and my god is that one of my favorites. Which honestly lead me to at first think I was a trans lesbian.  But I couldn't shake something for a while and I didn't really know how else to explain it. I wasn't attracted to men in any way shape or form, yet I found myself attracted to characters like astolfo, asuramaru, and Felix. Characters whom as you so bluntly stated was basically chicks with dicks.  I honestly have no idea how to describe it without it sounding like a fetish because I'm still very ignorant. 
I don't even know how to make sense of it. It wasn't until I learned of the identity Gynosexual/gynoromantic and another version which is similar that I recently learned of, neptunic. Both of which from my simple understanding are simply an attraction to femininity in general. Which I think more or less fits me. Though is that valid? I have no idea. Honestly to me it just kinda feels like bi with extra steps. Am I just lesbian? Or bi with a strong feminine preference? My journey started thanks to anime, helping me as a guide, and I've been figuring stuff out since then.
Damn... Just got linked here from another post, but... Damn... I want so bad to valiantly embrace my cringiest but most comfortable side of myself as you say here... Just for the sake of feel the most true to myself, even at expenses of other people's opinion... 

I need this, not only written, but put in practice by me...

I didn’t know anyone ever thought of cat girl stuff or “uwu” speak that highly. I just thought it was some crap creepy people use. Or what extremely childish people use.
Just wanna say I’m another person that got linked to this several months later and my god thank you for putting this into words so goddamn well, I may not feel exactly the same but this makes me feel extremely seen

Also tho I wanted to share that almost immediately after reading this I scrolled down and saw this post (but crossposted to r/gaysoundsshitposts): https://reddit.com/r/anime_irl/comments/tzp0sl/anime_irl/

And it immediately made me think back to your essay and like, does this comic feel extremely offensive problematic and out of touch? Yes absolutely, but does the person in it also look incredibly cute and absolutely rock that maid dress and make me wish I looked like that? Also yes absolutely
in the words of max0r, i may be cringe, but that makes me free
I'm not transfem, but live some of the boyness I've never had through strong, cute, honest shonen anime (and video game) characters. And I'm crying as I read this.
UwU is a need on this hostile world. Especially for non-normative folks like us neurodivergent, racialized trans and enbies.
i literally do not have the ability to read all of this

i am so fuxkibgw aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa
>astroturfing is when a subversive social movement is co opted by a business or government into a marketable and socially acceptable form that is no longer subversive or challenging to society.

Small point to the overall essay, but this doesn't seem like a very good definition of astroturfing. It's kind of the opposite actually. The point of astroturfing is to make it seem like it's coming from the general public. Astroturfing would be if the subversive movement, coming from the government or marketing itself, pretended that their position was public consensus in the first place. Co-opting a subversive movement, by definition, would be counterproductive because that would mean it's not public consensus. Similarly, if a point of view is being pushed by a show it is by definition not astroturfing because it isn't trying to appear like it's coming from the general public.
i feel so seen i am glad that i am not the only one who wants to be an adorable cat girl >w<. i'm going to keep uwuing and blushing because i love being cute so much >\\\\<
Same here, the way it is all said, puts perfectly into words a lot of thoughts I could never describe

Bingo. I agree, very insensitive. But I also agree that the heart of the comic, the soul of the thing is promoting and idea of acceptance of gender non conformity.

Awkward bathroom situation.	"Some details (fTm trans, pre-op and no hormones yet)

My parents took me out for dinner(I was grateful) and I was wearing my binder and more male presenting clothes.

Then I had to go the bathroom.

It was a more country-style older restaurant, so they only had male and female restrooms.

I don’t fully seem male so I stood outside the restrooms for at least 15 minutes wondering what to do because there was no gender-neutral bathrooms available.

Am I a hypocrite for using the female restroom? 

I really wished there was a family restroom but apparently it’s not as common as I thought, Is it ok for me to feel awkward using either a male or female restroom?

Edit: My name Is Elliot, you can call me Eli!

Another Edit: When I actually left the female restroom, a female patron saw me and went to the other restroom (The men’s), she then checked the sign and gave me a strange look.

Gave me a little Gender Euphoria ngl."	"You're not a hypocrite. Of course, if I was there, I would fight anyone that would complain about your choice of bathroom. Let's see how indignant they can be with 210cm of grumpy trans lady in their grill!
my guy, no need to feel like a hypocrite. Its okay to feel awkward at this stage in your transition, I'm in the same boat.
noo def not. i am very shy/non-confrontational and early in transition i would go to whichever restroom i felt like i would attract the least attention. even nowadays public restrooms make me anxious even though nobody has ever actually said a mean thing to me about using the women's restroom, ever.

do what makes you comfortable and keeps you feeling safe.
I continued using the woman's restroom until my testosterone made me pass enough. The day I stopped using the woman's restroom was the day a woman looked so startled that I was in there, I had to pitch my voice high to pretend that I was just a very boyish looking gal to soothe her. Felt so damn bad.
I'm transmasc nonbinary, also pre-op and no hormones, and I typically just use the female bathroom if there isn't a neutral option (very rarely do I use the male bathroom, and it's usually extremely situational). I've gotten weird looks, I had someone try to tell me I was in the wrong bathroom once, but at the end of the day I feel safer being incorrectly in the female one than incorrectly in the male one. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
Hell no.  I use the men's restroom even when I go full femme because I don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable.  I am 100% clockable and the last thing I want is to get someone beating the shit out of me or startle someone.

Edit: So, thanks to a bunch of cis girls that have started hanging out with me now I am comfortable going in the women's restroom.  Especially at clubs and bars.  They started by just dragging me in there but now it just seems like the normal choice.
I think it's fine man. If you don't feel comfortable going to the bathroom that matches your identity at least partially for your own safety and there's no gender neutral options you gotta do what you feel most safe and comfortable doing.
Bro use the men's room. Just move to a stall and do your business most dudes are too busy trying to look anywhere other than at another dude in the bathroom (can't be gay!!! /s) to honestly notice shit and if you are even half way presenting masc I'm betting dollar to pasos you will be fine.

  For the record I am a 5'11 broad shoulder gal in Texas who has yet to be harassed in TEXAS of all places the 2 years I've been out. I honestly feel like my days are numbered at this point... 🤔

Edit: just wanted to add another tip for my trans bros. Dude in the stall = shit bomb gtfo. Chances are you will just end up clearing the restroom. 🤣
Goodness no definitely not a hypocrite. Especially with gender bathroom bullshit going on these days. Need to be safe
I can completely understand. I have been so scared starting to use the womens room.   I would stand up for you anytime.
At my work there isn’t a gender-neutral option and I don’t pass, so I always use the women’s bathroom. It’s not hypocritical to be safe in places where others could attack you for the wrong choice.
So I am a trans female (Mtf) and at work everyone calls me she and everything but I still use the men's room as I am scared some customer will think I am a pervet or some shit trying to like do shit to people for using the right restroom.
Im mtf 2 years hrt and i still have a huge freakout when i need to use the bathroom and i cant find a disable/neutral one
One time, I went to the bathroom at school while wearing a skirt and I was kicked out by a transphobe teacher 🙄 Literally cannot do anything without people being weird lol
Hey Eli, you're not a hypocrite, you can use whatever restroom you feel most comfortable in. I didn't use the correct restroom until.. probably a year into my hormonal transition? So don't worry about it.
It's really hard at the start with transition. 

I also once stood for minutes just a few days after coming out presenting feminine trying to figure which toilet to use. That struggle is real
I'm in your same position and I use the female bathroom more often then I would like as the only gender-neutral ones are usually for those with disabilities or baby change rooms. Using those ones when someone else could need it stresses me out.

I use the female because I don't feel safe in the males. I know I make the women in there uncomfortable but I don't have much of a choice until I start T
Just curious, I know how to pronounce Elliot, but what about Eli? Is is like Eli Manning or ‘Ellie’ like Elise?

Also, nope, not a hypocrite.
Usually my go to solution is to look for a disabled toilet, since you don't need to be visibly disabled to use one and nobody will question it. That way there's no need to pick a gendered one.

Though, if there isn't one I usually go female toilet too (I'm pre-everything FTM as well), I've tried the male toilets a few times and it's just hard to adapt to, and I'm scared of being called out for being there. At least in the females they can see I have feminine features and I have a bust that's kind of hard to hide even with a binder.

Best thing to do is just whatever you're most comfortable doing, even if it takes you a while to warm up to the idea.
Depending on where you are, especially in the states, it's just safer to do this if you aren't 100% passing imo so you're totally in the clear. I do it too, and haven't even tried going to the men's room ever yet myself cuz I'm super super paranoid about getting hurt out here in Texas
I (trans girl) also went to a men's restroom a few months ago and it felt a bit bad afterwards. But it's okay. You and only you decide which one you go to, and either choice is okay. It'll probably take a little more time to feel comfortable and/or safe enough to use your gender's restroom instead of your agab's one, and that's very understandable. Go at your own pace, you're valid regardless of what a stupid sign on a toilet door says.
unfortunately, some times using the womens restroom is just safer. it sucks and hurts sometimes, but i’d rather be safe
I do the same sometime
I was in your same boat at school. I was even willing to risk getting a bladder infection because I felt uncomfortable to use the bathrooms and I didn’t want to make others feel uncomfortable. 

I eventually was able to have a laminated pass to use the library bathrooms, no exceptions; by the Head Counsellor of my school, how neat is that! Made me very happy.
Thank you! I’m just not comfortable with using gendered bathrooms because I’m not fully male yet and not fully female…it’s very uncomfortable.
Be my mom pls
I literally am only confident online, my voice is still very high, so every time someone meets me they always think I’m mute until I have to speak.
😔 after that they always say my voice is ‘cute’
I had the same once (I'm still pre everything)

This woman came in with her young daughter, she saw me, went and checked they were in the women's and literally death glared at me while hugging her daughter away from me.

I was just washing my hands.

I'm 5'6 and was anorexic at the time.

She had a solid two inches on me and looked a lot stronger.

Yet I scared her.

I still have to use the women's 😓
That must’ve sucked, I hope that everything was better after that.
I worry more about that using the men's restroom than the women's.
E-Lie, essentially.

Thanks for asking!

Who is Eli Manning? Hope I don’t seem stupid, I don’t follow any news on famous people.
I totally understand. You're fully male to me, at least.
Same situation here, also a trans man.
Giant mom hug!
Damn, that sucks so bad. I am lucky that in a usual setting, I don't scare women. Mostly because they are usually taller than me by an inch or so. I am a scrawny 5'3 man. Used to bother me a lot until I realized I didn't need to be tall to pass. People just think I am a teenager. Which can be annoying at times. Lol.

I am rambling. Sorry that happened to you, friend.
Yeah, no harm done. I still prefer the family restrooms regardless because my stupid brain doesn't think I pass even if nobody blinks an eye when I make my way to the men's restroom.
🙂
Second! You're male. Rock the cloak of masculinity your way
I love family restrooms, it makes me so happy that my work has one and they gave me an all-access pass to use it.
My work has two, thank god. It is kinda awkward when my newer coworkers that don't know give me a weird look when I do go out of my way to use them. I just explain that I gotta mad shite and wanna be mindful of my bros in the urinals. Lmao.
Lmao, mine just think it’s because it’s cleaner
I'll fuckin drink a beer to that one, mate. Lmao.

I’m tired of people thinking all trans people have to be full time activists	I’m still a teenager, in a small town, in Indiana. I can’t really do much except cutting my hair and wearing “boy” clothes. Yet, my mom said it’s “transphobic” for me to not protest all the time. Though, she likes to out me, say slurs since “she was called them” and so on. I’m sick and tired of it. If you want me to act like a teenager, let me act like a teenager.	"You shouldn't have to participate in any of that if you don't want to.

I myself am a very private person and I see no issue in keeping my ""trans-life"" between myself and my partner for the most part. Even if people misgender/misname me I often don't care.
Sounds like the classic and trite transphobe calling others transphobic to appear less transphobic
Look, it's a lot of work. I do more in person outreach because I have the time now. You're in one of the worst states to do any activism and so young (I'd arguably say too young and unsupported) to be able to take on that responsibility. We just want to be people and have no issues, even though sometimes they come to us (Texas here, so I get it, although being a 6'7"" goth 50s housewife definitely helps discourage negative interactions).
Hey I’m a 23 yo trans woman in Indiana, tell your Madre that I’m out here protesting for you! You’re right, now is the time for you to be a kid. Also activism will eventually become a part of your life as you become older so yea no need to rush that. Also tell her this process of transition is more than putting on new clothes, this is a long game and it takes time. I wish you luck in your journey! ☺️
I very much wanted to be a private person at the start of transition, and that has changed for me VASTLY since then

Outside of depression I love being loud about it, I enjoy voicing my opinion as a Trans woman and fighting for the same rights and safeties as everyone else is supposed to have

I can't help but to get upset whenever I hear about trans people being mistreated and it can feel toxic at times, but being invested in this fight on a deeply personal level makes me feel like part of a greater community, one that I can help in my own unique way
Eh, screw that. A couple of the biggest trans influencers I know, I was following their work for years before I even knew they were trans. 

For most people that's pretty much the desired outcome- we just want to live our lives normally with our preferred gender. It shouldn't be seen as a political statement or act of defiance.

It's all well and good joining protests and being active against bigotry, but there are many great causes and it's also a lot of work. Being trans isn't your sole defining feature as a person. You're so much more than your gender.

Still, I wish you all the best with that mother of yours!
Being forced to be an activist all the time is *exhausting* and often uses up mental energy on battles you can't win, leaving you too drained for battles you otherwise could have.
Just like you can be a feminist and don't spend all your energy fighting the patriarchy.
You are allowed to just exist and live your life 💜
I mean on one hand trans people should be allowed to just live. On the other— in a society where it isn’t okay to be trans, being trans in itself is an act of protest. So I mean like just a thought
living our lives is in itself an act of defiance. you’re a teenager, let us adults fight the fight. however, when you’re an adult your priorities change when you see your siblings suffering or even if our state is creating a trans hit-list and is planning on making bring trans practically illegal. indifference in the face of oppression is participation in oppression. sorry not sorry.
Right? I’m fucking tired of people always asking me if I’ve heard about the most recent transphobic controversy at my school/city/county. I don’t owe them an explanation of every incident that involves trans people and if it matters that much to them then they should be an activist. We Are Not A Fucking Monolith. Some of us don’t want to talk about it and that’s okay
Not everyone has the emotional capacity to protest all the time, and that’s okay.  Sometimes just surviving is exhausting.

While protesting is important, the most impactful thing you can do is be yourself and live your best life each and every day with every single person you meet.  The joy we experience being ourselves is what, I think, will eventually win out in the end.
Honestly sounds miserable to try to be an activist all the time
Remember when they wanted to raise the voting age?
I agree, you shouldn't have to do any protesting or activism if you don't want to. Being trans is already enough of a statement as is, just mostly to aholes who want to pick on others different from them anyway. I don't do much of that other than maybe bicker with strangers on the web who are being transphobic (which btw feels pointless but I can't stop myself), I do it because I want to. Your mom forcing you to do it isn't the same as activism, wish she'd understand that.
Yeah it would be nice if the idiots where I live didn’t look at me like a walking political statement for wearing what I want when I go out. I’m just being me.
I'm in Southern Indiana myself, really nervous about the next few months because my chest is starting to come in and ofc I live in the conservative shithole portion. I'd love to go do activist stuff but I don't have a car, my mom isn't super supportive, and once again, the conservative shithole area
Every one has their own way of supporting the community. Just you existing can inspire people or help them feel valid.

Your mom's behavior is inexcusable. She should support you and provide a safe space for you. Sadly, not many people have that kind of support. I wouldn't tolerate a stranger treating me that way. A family member should be better than that.

Wishing you the best on your journey!
Op, if you ask me, it's time to be a kid. To be able to make those mistakes we all do. Learn the lessons. Laugh, Love. Lose. 

Being an activist seems to be aimed at making sure YOU get to be the REAL you while you do those things. Do them. Let those who have the mental energy fight this battle. You can tag in when you feel ready. 

To those who say to do as you will. Thank you. Some of us can't yet. For whatever reason. Thank you for standing the watch.
Omg I hate it when people think we're all protestors, we're just trying to get by without constant judgment and discrimination.
I’m so sorry, dude.  The only type of activism that you should be doing right now is simply existing in a world that isn’t set up for your success.  Show up in life the way you want to - a lot of us (adults in the community) do the work that we do so that you can focus on being a kid. 

Remind your mom that a lot of trans activists are out here trying to make sure that y’all DON’T have your adolescence taken from you, like ours was.
Hello neighbor!
In my belief, the goal of being a parent is not only to raise your child in a way that you believe is best, but also raise your child in an environment you wish you grew up in. I'm sorry your mother treats you this way.

I'm not active at all in trans activism. Yeah I am caught up on the news pertaining trans topics and have many opinions, but being an activist isn't my thing. I'm just some guy in my day-to-day life. Me being trans is something I prefer to keep private. I hope your mother realizes that there are a handful of trans people who prefer to live a quiet life living as how they identify as and there's quite literally nothing transphobic about that.
Being a teenager is hard enough on it’s own. You have your entire life ahead of you to be an activist if you want to, if not that’s perfectly fine as well.
Just existing to people is an act of rebellion and protest.

She sounds delightful and very much someone I'd want to be be around. /s

If you want to be an activist, be one. If you don't, don't. You should be able to do things to the level that you want to. I hope you're able to get outta there sometime, or at least have people in your life that support you. Your mom is both being bigoted and ignorant, for what it's worth. Wishing you much happiness.
I hope you can enjoy your youth and life as you would want it to be. Best of luck to you *waves from across your northern border
Let me live my life, not make me have to right to protect my existence everyday
Every teenager needs a chance to be a teenager regardless of their gender. You need to hang out with friends, drink way too much coffee, and watch movies that would appall your grandmother. You should only protest if YOU want to. 

Be young! Enjoy yourself! Eat ice cream in the winter! Play too many video games! Learn to drive and save up for your first car! Read comics! Be your authentic self! You're worth it!
I feel you. I’m 29 and just can’t. My partner and I live paycheck to paycheck, so I’m too busy making sure our shits good too to worry about others rn :( it hurts because I do wanna go to protests and stuff, but sometimes it’s like we’re made to feel bad if we can’t
You don’t have to do anything you don’t want to dawg, you’re also just a teenager—
Homie, you can just dress the way you want and have your hair a certain style, that’s the same thing I do
If your mom cares so much about activism, why doesn’t she do it herself
That’s something that has scared me a lot over the years, it’s really important that we have representation and be able to be the way we are without fear, but it’s something that’s been concerning to me because i don’t want to have everyone know I’m trans sort of thing, I’ve always wanted to transition and just live my life and only really tell people I want to.  I dint want my transition to be a statement
It’s important to advocate for yourself as much as safety can allow. 

Tell your mom the next time she drops a slur “nice job setting the example…” or “way to go allowing generational trauma to continue.” Or “congratulations on being that person.”
Yeah, I want to live as a dude but not as a trans dude. Only people who know me pre-transition and other trans people know about it (other than those my mom has outed me to). I’m ok with doing a little activism, but only really once I’m an adult and I’m in a better mental spot.
I don’t think she’s actually fully transphobic but some things she does are. I do think she has a savior complex though
I told her that since school is pretty unsafe to be out as trans I don’t want to until I’m out of school. She called me transphobic for that and “extremely privileged since I have white male privilege” though I’m ftm (not denying the white privilege part). Activism is hard enough, let alone deal with being a teen on top of that.
Me being trans is a statement itself, and is amplified by how I dress. I do everything to imitate the style of 2000’s emo dudes. Luckily, though I can’t move out for a little while, I have my dads house to go to on the weekends. Over there is much nicer since neither my dad or stepmom try to make me be an activist.
She does some, like make instagram posts about stuff. But she’s never gone places and protested or gone to pride. She likes to argue about how “she’s the supportive parent” yet my dad (who is also straight and cis) is more open to me being trans and HAS gone to pride.
Sadly it sounds like your mom is using you as a political prop. I would ask her to stop.
My mother would say she supported and accepted me after I came out, but she would also constantly say and do things to undermine me, undermine my confidence, my desire to transition etc. Sometimes parents (or anyone) will act deceptively - pretend to be on your side when really they aren't. The thing about outing you is an astronomical red flag in itself. My sister (who is basically a younger version of my mother) would do this all the time as well. And her calling you transphobic for not protesting sounds like she is setting an impossible standard in an effort to make you believe that you are less valid as a trans person. I am not saying that is what is happening, but it can be difficult for a young mind to figure out, let alone accept how toxic some people are, especially the ones that are supposed to love and protect you. Just know that your instincts are right and that you dont have to accept behaviour you dont agree with from anyone. Best of luck 💚
What? What is ""fully transphobic?"" She does unequivocally transphobic things, she's therefore transphobic.

""Yeah, my uncle might say the n word all the time and minorities slurs, but he's not fully racist, you know?""

???
Excuse my entire language, but that's fucking bullshit. Your safety is more important than anything else here. We get murdered every day for being ourselves, only take the risks you're comfortable with.
Glad you have respite from that and other family that are supportive (?).
Me who wants to j live my life and not be a political scapegoat
no, there is definitely such a thing as somewhat transphobic and fully transphobic. i've met people who will on the whole be pleasant and call you what you ask unless it comes up, but will tell you they don't get it and they think it's stupid if you ask. that is a very different scenario than the people for instance who hold anti trans protests and send bomb threats to hospitals that provide gender affirming services. OP's mom might not be one of those people, but it is definitely not an all or nothing situation with hate
I mean that she supports me being trans, as well as others. Though I believe she does transphobic things. There are things she definitely needs to work on though, and those things are what makes her kinda transphobic.
Don’t worry about the language, it’s fine. She kept on telling me that I can’t just not do activism since I’m “uncomfortable”. I wanted to tell her about the trans genocide but she wouldn’t give me a chance to talk.
I'm not saying that there aren't different degrees of hate. But they're both still hate.

The people who litterally did lynchings are clearly much worse than someone who's just casually racist. But they're both still racist. Calling the latter ""not fully racist"" I don't think does anything but excuse their behavior, as they carry water for the lynchers.

Perhaps this video, [The Alt-right Playbook: The Cost of doing Business](https://youtu.be/wCl33v5969M), will help explain my position.
My way of phrasing things to my mom was ""you have a choice: live, loving daughter, or a dead son. Which one do you want?"" You absolutely don't have to be an activist. And ""uncomfortable"" may not be the right word. It's a legitimate fear for your life. Does she want you safe and to have self autonomy or does she not? Why is it so important to a straight(?), white, cis woman? Seriously, if you don't know, ask her why. She has no fucking idea what we go through every day and I live in one of the most trans friendly cities in the south (other than Austin and Atlanta). I have the sheer intimidation on my side through size, and that's not enough to guarantee my safety. Here's the difference: I'm a fully grown, independent adult who can do outreach in a decent sized metro area. I still don't walk to the corner store alone at night, even though it's maybe a quarter of a mile. Small rural towns? Head's on a swivel, even if I'm sure there's only me around."	10unz37	trans	287	0.99	2023-02-05 21:24:24
My wife got me some starter bras and clothes and accessories today and I just feel..😍😍😍		"That is awesome!  What a great smile you have. It’s wonderful you have her support. Have a wonderful day!
Sorry, I’m confused (my normal state, actually)…. Is this a picture of you or your wife?  Because if this is your pic, then like, Wow, you really look quite lovely (I’m being straight-up sincere, btw!).
That is so wonderful! I love to see it when spouses are so supportive, I love the love! (And speaking of, by the way, you're lovely!)
Yay!! Hats off to your wife because you look amazing and very femme presenting. I’m happy you have such a supportive partner.
You look so pretty and happy
That amazing! Im so happy for you! You really deserve it!! You look great by the way!
Wow girl, what a beautiful smile.
God, you look so gorgeous!

Venting bad (16, mtf)	"Sorry to drop all my thoughts here, I just often feel so shit at the moment, I wish I was just born cis. I’m never going to actually be a girl. I’m never going to be able to wear girly clothes or makeup. I’m never going to be able to grow my hair long. I’m never going to be able to transition. I look like a boy, I have a boy’s body, I sound like a boy, everybody knows I’m a boy, nobody is ever going to see me even as a normal person. I’m going to lose all my friends if I continue with this. My family is gonna hate me. There’s nothing going for me at all and there’s just no point in doing anything. I’ve ruined my life, I hate myself and everyone around me. There’s no point in even trying to continue, I mean I quite literally hate my own skin, and if I do somehow manage to live as myself in the future, I’ve already lived my life as a boy, I haven’t got a clue how to do things like makeup, tie up my hair or anything that normal girls can just do. I don’t know how to be a girl, I’ll never be a girl, there’s no point. 

Why do I have to think all this, and at the same time I don’t even have a solid understanding of my identity, I don’t know if I’m a boy, girl or something inbetween but I do know that I hate this process. Why couldn’t I of just been born normal"	"hey hun, you're catastrophizing. what that means is believing things to be very bad when in reality it's not that way. most trans women I know have at some point felt exactly what you're describing, and they are 100% gorgeous and 100% women. you're young, it could be a hard journey- even if it is, it'll be okay. take a deep breath, drink some water, and tell yourself the truth - tell yourself who you are (woman, nonbinary, however you identify) because you are valid and seen and important. you are so so important. I mean that from the bottom of my heart, our community has lost far too many people and each of us are so important. you're beautiful. there are a lot of people here especially who have been where you're at, and they made it thru. you'll be okay
You will find yourself, you're young and theres no deadline to transition. 

I totally feel you on not knowing how to do normal girl stuff, but that doesn't mean you can't learn! And just cause you don't know those things doesn't mean you aren't or will ever be a girl. Being a girl isn't defined by makeup or hair.

Take it one step at a time, things will get better. It's easy to not see that transitioning is a long process. Results and changes are not quick and it takes time. It's a 2nd puberty, puberty takes a few years to finish and even then you still grow after. Do one thing at a time, watch some makeup tutorials, find some exercises that help you look more feminine, focus on some small stuff and work your way up to bigger stuff

No matter where you are, there will be people who support and love you and won't hate you : )

If you need someone to talk to, you can talk to me! We gotta support our sisters : )
ftm I was straight up just crying about this an hour ago, and honestly I have no idea what to do either
I know exactly how you feel and I'm not really sure how to help or what to say but just know it gets better, i promise it gets better.
feel 1:1 the same
I had both the curse and boon of realizing much later than you. I’m 26, just started transitioning a few months ago.

You have the benefit that you’ll get to have so much more time living your true life. Unfortunately it’s also harder as a kid- you don’t have the autonomy in your own life to control your path, so not having a supportive network of friends and family must be really hard :(

I hope you can see that being trans there will always be a “grass is greener”, “if only XYZ were the case”, type of scenario. I’m very envious of you in many ways, as I unfortunately have lost most of my 20s, and don’t think I’ll really feel like a woman until I’m 30 :/ start taking baby steps-grow your hair out (say you wanna look like a rockstar if someone needs an excuse), learn to makeup in private, research HRT access and laws in your country/state for being a minor. Baby steps.
First of do you want a hug? I also pass by that I can talk to you about my journey to help you, if you want my dm are open if you want to talk.
Hey, you’re a valid person and you ARE a girl, you will pass as a girl, and you are just as normal as the rest of us. I’m also 16 and mtf and I was literally just thinking about all of this and I’m really sorry how things are showing up but I promise you it will get better! Lots of love from a fellow sister <3
Hey, it's going to be okay.
So sorry hun, also feel similar and also 16 and can’t transition likely ever
I know how it feels but ftm. I'm so sorry you feel like that, but trust me i know it might seem like it now but soon enough you'll feel how you really are.  If your friends can't except you, there not good friends, same goes for your family. Even if you don't feel like you look like a girl, doesn't mean you aren't one. You could always look up tutorials for makeup and vocal training<3
I'm sorry to read anything here, it just sounds like you're going through a really rough patch in your life. I've been there and I know it can be a really really hard to be kind to yourself. You have to learn how to be nice to yourself, how to not throw yourself under the bus, and how to forgive yourself. It is said often that forgiving others is not too hard, but the self is hardest to forgive, but I would encourage you to do it anyway. Start with forgiving yourself for not understanding. You are young at 16, you don't have much life experience, you don't even really know too much about yourself, people don't know about you. You have the world to gain by learning how to write your wrongs with yourself, bonus if you can learn to do this with others as well. We are sensitive beings, it does not take much to upset most people, so we have to learn resilience to phenomena, and to not take it so personal, or so seriously. It's just emotions that are arising to be felt and healed. They are arising so you can integrate more of yourself. The biggest thing to abandon is the cultivation of hatred with yourself, it isn't true, it is just a well-disguised delusion we are fed that there even is someone to hate. Seeing the negative effects, the unskilfulness involved, the pain, and the ill-will in hatred of anything, I don't cultivate it, and so many people would agree with me.
Yeah I’m kinda here too. I’m out to some friends and I’m growing my hair long, but past that I’m probably never going to transition for the sole reason that I’m just a massive coward and could never come out to my mum, let alone my dad.
I'm transitioning at 25 so..  I very much have had a male body especially after joining the military and being in for 5 years. But that's the thing. None of that matters. You are who you are inside. Hrt can do some pretty magical stuff given time.  But trust me you have a VERY big window to be able to transition. Don't give up hope. 

With love, Jamie 💕
dont worry.

unfortunately nothing comes without learning thou may be makeup for example, everyone had to learn this and you with enough practice you will be able to do it too, so please dont stress it and take your time, youre gorgeous and valid.

ly <33
Im 22 mtf and I understand completely. The fact of the matter is those ""friends"" who choose to break away aren't real friends I learned that the hard way a real friend will be there and support you no matter what. Family will adjust to the change believe me and once you do (if you choose to) get a change to be who you really are than nobody has to know about who you were born as. Remember its a ""dead name"" for a reason and the best advice I can give is lift your chin up and be strong for we are all here for you no matter the struggle sister
hey, i’m 20 and four months HRT. i felt like this a lot from when i was 12 to just a few months ago, when i started. i knew i was a girl, but my family wouldn’t let me do anything about it.

i say this because i realized a week or two into hormones that i was happy. i had my work cut out for me (still do), but even just knowing i was on my way was a big load off. it was encouraging to know i wasn’t getting dragged in the wrong direction anymore.

i felt as hopeless as you may right now, but right when i saw my first changes due to HRT, i realized… it is really real. we’re girls, and we totally do have the ability for our fix our birth sex. 

let yourself feel bad, it’s ok. but do not abuse yourself, and don’t let anyone take your feminine identity from you. that’s something that even a lot of cis women have to deal with.

it will get better if you can make it through. i promise. and i never thought that’d actually be true, but it was
girl, i know you’re in a bad state rn but i would recommend being yourself when you’re by yourself, like your own thoughts, a diary, on the internet, in your room or whatever your safespace is and when you’re independent or confident in coming out you can do whatever you want(eg. transition). all of us have gone through this stage and it’s part of the reason why we lose so many people in our community. it’ll all be fine trust me
Can relate
I think the same way. I'm 23 and married. Whenever I think of not transitioning, it literally is the same thing as sudokuing the real you. It's like dying, not being the real you. I've aways felt like a corpse. But all the backlash from transitioning is scary. Sometimes people don't understand and hate you, but you don't live for them; you live for you.
Catastrophising is a word I didn’t think I’d need
Similar thing here, 16 ftm too. After reading a lot of posts here and on other subreddits, I'm actually getting pretty confident for the future. I'm 5', really skinny, not even close to passing, but I know that there are cis men like me out there. I know I'm no less of a man than any cis man is. And neither are you.

This all sounds corny as fuck, but it's the truth.

I wish I could give you and all the struggling ftms out there a hug, because it's going to be okay.
I'm 21 now, nby on low dose t for 9.5ish months. It took me until I was 19 to really figure out that I'm trans, and by then I was 5'1""ish and very physically feminine. Those things won't change much, if at all, but exactly like you said, there are plenty of cis men out there who are my height or shorter and there are plenty of more physically feminine cis men. There's no right or wrong way to be your gender.

Mia Mulder just released a video about detransitioning that touched on this; she went into the feminist ideas surrounding gender, specifically Judith Butler's idea of gender as a performance. You *are* gender because you *do* gender. That isn't always an external thing: you can be your gender because you have all the desires to do gender, even if you aren't in a place to do them outwardly. Being and doing can become synonymous when you realize that being your gender is an action you do all the time.

To OP, you can totally still be a girl even if you can't do ""girl things"" now. Apply the girl power motto: GIRLS CAN DO ANYTHING! If you're a girl who has to pretend to be a boy for a while, that's totally valid! If you're an enby who comes to realize that later, that's also totally cool! There is no right or wrong way to be your gender, whatever it may be. In the meantime, do your best to try to surround yourself with people who will love you and support you even if they don't understand how you feel. You have a huge community behind you, and we all have your back."	w71upp	trans	291	0.98	2022-07-24 18:08:46
I'm curious, has anyone else's relationship to clothes changed since beginning transitioning? Like, I used to hate clothes shopping, but now I can't get enough!		"Lol, I just had this thought the other, I used to hate shopping for anything but since I've realised I wasn't cis; shopping has been amazing.
I guess since now I'm living my true self, I now love the clothes I see in stores, instead of just browsing through clothes that I don't like.
It's complicated. I'm definitely getting way more into fashion than I ever have before, and I love going shopping and looking at all the fun clothes, but then it comes time to try them on and I have to wear boys sizes so I still don't get to wear the clothes I want. And boys sizes really don't expect skinny boys to have massive thighs, so I have to go a size up and get pants that are too long and baggy, making me look sloppy, or wear pants that hurt to wear and that I might bust out of at any moment.

So yeah I love shopping more now but hate how the clothes I like look on my body, so it's kind of souring the shopping part for me all over again. Just get to look at a lot of fun things I can't afford/won't look good on me.
Yep! Once I realised I was trans I started to actually think about what clothes I liked, instead of just swapping between two sets of the same outfit. Still wear the same outfits because I don't talk to enough people to ""know how I feel about gender"" so... ¯⁠\⁠_⁠(⁠ツ⁠)⁠_⁠/⁠¯
Yup for sure! I never felt the need to buy new clothes before. My partner used to give me shit because i was still wearing clothes i’d had since early college, but now I’ll spend hours shopping online every day, i guess because i’m finally able to indulge in the clothes i always felt barred from before, and they make me feel good and excited about myself and my body now.

i actually used to do this funny thing where i would browse female clothing sites pre-transition just so the ad boxes on social media sites would market to me like a girl. the little things lol
Used to have 0 to do with cloth shopping growing up and even as a adult hated choosing any clothing 🥲 kept mostly the same wardrobe sense leaving high school now I love shopping just wish I had more free time and funds to do so 😭 good thing after coming out I could steal a lot of wifeys wardrobe and we share clothes a lot now 🥰
For 40+ years I'd throw on a pair of jeans or khakis & grab the next clean polo shirt.  I dreaded those days when I'd have to wear a suit. 

There came a day,  early in my transition, when I walked through the local mall, looking at all the cute outfits.  I was hyperventilating when I left the mall that day. 

Now my wardrobe has variety & color, and fills two closets. I enjoy selecting & wearing clothes that allow me to express myself.
Same here. I used to always dread going clothes shopping with my family growing up and now I love buying new clothes. I’m also really excited to go shopping for new dress shirts now that I’ve had top. I’ve almost completely gotten over my fear of changing in the changing rooms at stores too.
100%
100%
Absolutely!
Oh yes. I'm guilty 😔  I'm addicted to online shopping now
I even started impulse buying. I don't think there is treatment for this addiction.
I used to hate wearing long sleeves due to my career choice of welding and dealing with hot things most times, now I absolutely love them because I am not a fan of not having anything to help contain the little booba I have.
Definitely! I used to hate it but now I love it. But I think that's a pretty common experience for a lot of us. I've been getting to explore all the pretty and lovely things that we can wear. I don't know about anyone else but that makes me feel really valid
recently went shopping for new clothes and loved every second of it! i could finally shop in the boys section  :D
I’m the opposite. Can’t stand clothes, so many limitations now. Can’t wear tight or white shirts. Need everything to be 100% cotton otherwise you can see my binder through it. I look feminine is shorts that are a little too short which sets off my dysphoria. I hate swimsuits cause, well that one doesn’t need explaining. Yeah idk. Always hated it, still do
I still hate clothes shopping, but mainly because I can only shop in the womens section as I’m not out yet, but my best friend’s brother is trans and I got some clothes from him pre transition and they are mens. I wore them and I didn’t know you could actually like the way clothes look on you and really like clothes that much until I put those on.
Used to hate it now I’m ok with it. Sometimes I get an urge to buy more clothes but very rarely.
Kinda related: I used to hate dancing but the first time I saw myself in the mirror wearing a dress & makeup & I had to dance! I have a lot of good memories from before I came out, when I was dolled up alone in my room late nights, dancing in the mirror listening to EDM & feeling hopeful about the future.
I hate clothes shopping it’s like going to work
I can definitely agree with your point but I'll like to add that for me, I started caring more about what I'm wearing.
For me. It’s finally being myself but also male clothes were so generic in design. You can only have so many jeans. Female clothes just have the variety I love
hated shopping before i came out, still hate shopping now. i do need to get new clothes tho :( maybe i’ll try to find that alt fashion store my friend mentioned, something that has things more to my taste might make it more fun idk
SAME
Not really? I guess I hated clothes for a long time but was growing more into fashion before I realized fully that I was trans. I guess once I got past ""dressing nice = being made fun of"" than I just liked being a little extra.
Yeah! Suddenly clothes shopping is about the delight of finding a perfect pair of bright red pants at a thrift store instead of just choosing the least unpleasant skirt and buying four of it
I wasn’t FOND of it but I liked being able to shop for boy clothes. Either that or I was just desperate lol. But since the Orlando trip, I’ve settled with 2 concert shirts and 2 hoodies: One that says Orlando that we got at the airport. One that I bought recently of the artist I saw in concert 😂. I switch them out in the washer (ofc I wear other clothes, but if I see any of these 4 clothing items available, I’ll always choose them. They’re just my favorites 🤣)
This is very much me! 

Depending on the day, I'd either absolutely hate it, or I'd be blah about it, but never enjoyed it.

I'm still mostly closeted because of family, but just since my egg cracking I've enjoyed shopping so much☺️

Although, I obviously don't get to do it a whole lot, and shopping for guys clothes sucks more now
I completely understand like I used to hate waiting on my mom and sisters at clothes stores but since I came out and started wearing more girly clothes I just can't decide and I think so many things are cute
All I used to wear was black. Now I wear only mostly black!
Not brave enough to buy clothes, yet. But I have been buying a ton of cute ornaments for my house, it's my new obsession since starting hrt.
I've worn black shorts and shirts for years, same ones no variation.

Now I've got my first outfit picked out and just waiting to get the money for it next month.

That includes a pair of chucks and cute boots. Cute. I never thought I'd be allowed to say that about my cloths :D

I'm working on losing weight and my goal is to be able to cosplay my XIV character, minus cat ears and tail. 

What I picked out is pretty much all black but there some white there too. I just need makeup no idea what to buy.
No, I Still hate shopping for men's clothing. But now, I found a new department to shop in.
Oh god yes.  I use to pride myself on how little I shopped. I'd been wearing some of the same clothes for 20+ years. For me clothes were a way to cover my body nothing not nothing less.

Now I actually like shopping. It's stressful as hell and I have no sense of style but I do like it. If only I had the budget to do it more often. 😣
Yes absolutely. I didn't care anything about clothes before transitioning to female. I just wore whatever the hell I had. Now I can't get enough
oh 100% I practically LIVED in clothes stores for a while last month
Same, literally got to be careful to not just buy everything I see.

Before with men's clothes I just could not give a shit, period.  All looked meh.  But, cant stop wanting to try different dresses and skirts and such.  Also want to eventually get into makeup and such to, at least to cover beard shadow if nothing else.
Oh yea, definitely, my wallet sure does not enjoy it though. Im still tryiing to find what style is for me though
Honestly no, I always have loved to go shopping so clothes would be important for me regardless of the gender.
Such a mood...!
Should've given me a clue, really.
I absolutely love shopping now. But not really into fashion or trends… at least not yet. Have tracked down my “colors” that go with my skin, hair, and eyes.

Also some exercising I enjoy now, too
Yep, I absolutely adore shopping for clothes now. Before I'd try to be in and out as fast as possible and didn't even care about what I'd actually get. Just the first thing I saw.
yup. partially i've just started to enjoy it more, and partially i'm on a constant quest for well-fitting men's clothes.

clothes have become much more interesting since i figured out why i hated them.
Yup same
Same i used to wear so much girly things and now it's just band shirts and merch in general.

Before I transitioned I never wore baggy clothes cause I felt like it wouldn't make fem enough and thought that society expects to be fem etc also loved Tod wear dresses and crop tops. I still have one crop I love but idk if I'm gonna wear it cause I bought it this summer and it's a long sleeve :')

Though I also mostly shop online because you can't find most clothes I'm wearing in everyday shops
Same here. I’m still recovering financially from the shopping bender I went awhile back.
I've been thinking about this non-stop lately. Me and my partner went out shopping for the first time recently so they could help pick out something that I could express myself in for the first time. I never liked shopping, but after that I have been online shopping constantly, even if it's just to see all my new options that I couldn't have before. I'm loving it now!
Omg! yes! I love clothes and fashion and accessories so much more now that I’m out. I can’t wait to start buying stuff soon.
Absolutely, well I’ve not begun transitioning but after I came out a friend took me clothes shopping and it was the first time I’ve enjoyed clothes
Haven't had the chance to go shopping for clothes since realizing I'm not a guy because due to circumstances I'm stuck with homophobic relatives for right now but... Is that why I hated clothes shopping?
I hate clothes shopping even more now, because of dysphoria.
I'm the exact opposite
The thought came to me when a friend's mother said something about how they used to hate clothes shopping too; I had to know after that
For me, it was like, I could find clothes that were okay, but never right in a way I couldn't explain
Yes!
*hugs* if that's something you're okay with
Yeah that part fucking sucks. Getting pants hemmed does help a lot though. It takes it from ""kid in dad's clothes"" to ""guy in kinda big pants""
If you ever want someone to talk gender with, feel free to message me 🙂

Can't guarantee to always be on, but I always reply lol
I know the budget war well! It's the small wins lol
That's great! I'm glad you're feeling more confident trying on new things 💚💙
Lol, neither do I 🤣😭😁
Yes!!! I love feeling cute or beautiful
*hugs* if those are acceptable
Hopefully soon you'll be able to go buy them for yourself too!
I can sympathize with that. I felt that way, before
I've said this exact thing lol
Yes, do. If there's a possibility of finding that spark, take it 😊
Oof, I know the pain
I hope that you're able to find a safe and welcoming place before long! And I hope you can find the joys of clothing!

Keep your head up okay? There are so many people who are going to love you for you and make you feel comfortable being that person!
 
*Hugs* if that's okay with you
*hugs* if that's okay
Is having things taken in an option you could explore?
Me tooo. Like soo much. It's one of the best feelings in the world. It's heaps good!
Thanks!
Thanks. *Hugs*
Tbh not sure what that means. Is that like making them skinnier or something?
Yes, essentially. Someone undoes the stitching, removes excess material and restitches the article to fit your body better
Oh, that actually sounds very helpful! I didn't know it was an option. Thank you!

You look incredible in that outfit
Don’t worry too much about boy or girl clothes. 
If it’s on a girl. It’s girl clothes.
bih thats a LOOK!!!! pop on an oversized flannel shirt or a cardigan. do the ""i stole my bf's clothes"" look!!!!! also thats a fucking dope shirt
Me too, sis 😭
You look great!
I got a tee that says “Part Myth, Part Legend, All Man” over a white silhouette of an alicorn. I wonder if i can somehow make that femme out of pure spite
tysm❤️❤️❤️
ty you're so sweet❤️❤️❤️
I bet you're super pretty in whatever you wear
I've seen girls wear stuff like that ironically. If you want to make it femme unironically I'd say just go all the way with a pink skirt a frilly overcoat and heels.
What can i say? I'm just tell you the truth

My brothers wedding day is going to be so uncomfortable for me.	"So I’m transgender mtf and I haven’t worn any mens clothes for over two years of any kind or gone a day without my makeup since I started wearing it three years ago because of how insecure I feel without them. My brother proposed to his girlfriend in May 2020 ( he did it while they went skydiving so as she was landing he got down on his knee) and I was super happy for them and still am. However a few months after he came to me and asked “Do you want to go to the wedding?” His question was surprising and I answered “ Of course I want to go to my little brothers wedding.” As of posting this, I am 25, he is 23, and the wedding is in 12 days. So after I said I wanted to go he asked me to tone down my transition, telling me that her family was not going to be very accepting of my identity at the wedding. I promised him that I wouldn’t wear a dress or skirt so just women’s pants and top for the wedding. But after he and my mother talked about it a bit more to me I agreed that for the day of the wedding I will pretend to be a guy again. No makeup, jewelry, nails, women’s clothes or shoes, or makeup. Even my bra has to go! I won’t be able to use the right bathroom dressed like that either. It’s going to be the most uncomfortable day of the last decade of my life. But with that deal came my mother’s unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards. I’m looking forward to seeing my brother get married but not looking forward to the day at all. Thankfully I’m not in any important roles for the wedding. Congratulations Ryan and Heather! I am very happy for you two but this is going to be very difficult for me. Thanks Reddit for letting me vent.

Edit: To all the people bashing on my family and saying I deserve better than this, I’m doing this to be nice to them. But when I get married they have to see me getting married to… whoever I get married to, guy or girl, not sure yet, and I’ll absolutely be wearing a beautiful wedding dress. So they have that to look forward to. Not saying any of you are being rude or mean or anything but adding in a detail I left out. Please don’t take it the wrong way."	">But with that deal came my mother’s unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards.

Yeah, that's not unconditional. She's literally setting up conditions for her support.

At first I thought 'yeah, I _kinda_ understand your brother asking to 'tone it down' if the inlaws are horrible and transphobic'. I might agree to the same for my brother. They want to remember the day without any scenes, probably. But then going further and having you pretend to be a guy again is just seriously uncool. He's your brother, he should stand up for you, defend you and let you be you.
So it sounds like he doesnt want his sister at the wedding he wants his brother. This is so rude, and it's always the trans person that has to change for everyone else, never the other way around. Like another commenter said, he owes you big time. Especially 3 years into the transition. Fucking disgusting. And so fucked for the rest of your family to make the decision for you.
I hope your brother seriously pays you back for that because its a huge fucking favor to ask. I hope the wedding is nice enough on its own to distract you from it even just a little bit!
Jesus, just don't go. I'm sorry, but you're just shooting yourself in the foot by going. You've been a woman for ~three years and your brothers girlfriends family is more important to your mother and him than you are. They don't support you, they don't accept you, and they only see you as a woman insofar as it is convenient to them. Just don't go.
So u have to disguise for a wedding… I personally wouldn’t, but its ok is your family and you know them better… if you feel unconfortable you can always leave early. But damn you are brave and sacrificed for your family… be strong sister!! Whatever you choose to make we are here so u can talk later about it.
Fuck that
Don’t go.
Yeah I wouldn't do this for my brother, mainly because my brother loves me and wouldn't ask me to do this. My brother would ban my mother from the wedding for not supporting me, and he sure as hell wouldn't choose someone else's family over my happiness. Sounds like you're being manipulated and you'll have people showing you these pictures telling you how great you look as a man for the rest of your life
Don’t even go. Your brother is transphobic too as is your mother
I’m sorry but I will never understand wanting to be there for special moments of others when they are marrying into a more unaccepting family and don’t respect you enough to love the authentic version of you. There are people out there who will love all parts of you and those people may not be your family but their love will mean exponentially more because it’s pure and unconditional. Do not minimize yourself to cling onto people who see you as something to be shamed of
I wouldn't go.
No gorl, no wedding.
If they mistake you for AFAB.. have a dress and makeup kit on stand by. That way if they make an issue of it - you can promise them to you'll go change into something 'more appropriate'.
If it was my bother saying that I'd literally tell to go f**k himself & his girlfriend too.. how dare he If his girlfriends family or his girlfriend doesn't like who you are, that's far from your problem and its absolutely his fault for marrying into such a terrible family. I'd stay far away from them or tell him either they must deal with it or you won't be going. Imagine being told ""stop being yourself"" because that's basically what he's saying!! Sheesh heck no you shouldn't be okay with that! Have some self respect
I’m in the same situation but I’m ftm :( you’re so strong, and you shouldn’t have to do that and I’m so sorry they’re making you. Maybe you could sneak a bra on or a little makeup or something just to feel a slight sense of femininity. You’re amazing and I’m proud of you. We both got this <3
Don’t go.
They don’t want you there, they want the person you pretended to be.
I simply wouldn’t go! You have to be you, he’s being completely unreasonable with no consideration to yourself
Honestly it’s nobody’s business. I would suggest going out separately all dressed how you want to. They are putting themselves in a bad mood by purposely misgendering u to the guests. It’s like no one knows till something is said.
Your brother is being ridiculous, your mother is being cruel, and if your little bro's wife-to-be thinks your existence is less important than The Big Day then she's cruel too. Are they trying to protect you from the family-in-law? Or are they telling you to relive uncomfortable, possibly traumatic moments when you want to be celebrating your brother's love freely because they don't want to ""admit"" that there is a trans woman on their side?

The first option is understandable, but still offensive. The second option is bullying and forcing you back into the closet. My sister spent a not insignificant amount of time at her wedding correcting our family when they deadnamed/misgendered me: if your brother won't do the same, then he's failing the lowest possible bar of respecting your transition. It may be he truly does love you as his big sister, but that doesn't excuse what he's said. You are not required to dress like a man. If you feel comfortable in a pantsuit, that's lovely! But do not let them bully you into suppressing who you are.

Best of luck, sis. I hope you enjoy some of the celebration. <3
I wouldn’t go. I know my siblings’ spouse’s families beyond the wedding days, including on Facebook, so it may come out eventually, or you may be doing this charade forever. Perhaps they are okay with a later date? 

Please be safe! I don’t know I could do this without serious mental stress and anxiety. I don’t know how I could “show up”. Maybe you could talk to a therapist or someone else?
Thats such a gross response from your brother and mother, you deserve to be who you are every single day. If they dont accept you for who you are then they dont even want the real you at the wedding. You are valid and deserve this girl ❤️
Don't go. Really
Just don't go to the wedding. Its a big thing to miss out on, but I believe in peaceful patriotic protest. You should let him know that who you are should have no affect on them.
Hope it goes well. Good luck!
Why would you agree to this? Your mom is going to accept you afterwards by denying who you are on the wedding day?

I think some transphobic family in law you'll never meet again can deal with you existing as a small part of the wedding.
I am so sorry you have to deal with that situation but I hope you have as much fun as you can at the celebration 🥰
Maybe there are a few things you can do to make yourself feel more comfortable without it being too obvious. For example:
-using clear coat to pain your nails 
-wearing the most comfy and glamours underwear 
-slightly tinted chapstick 
-maybe find unisex shoes with a slight heal 
-maybe keep some of your favorite makeup with you so you can apply a bit as soon as you're able to 
-this one is a bit silly but it made me happy during school when I was in the closet but draw the gender symbols in the bottom of your feet 

I hope you can lessen your discomfort. You are so strong, wish you the best
It's a big day for your brother and his fiance, sure.  They're going to make vows in front of both their families promising eternal love.

And as an entree to their vows they want you lie in front of everyone.  A lie that will only make it more difficult for you to be yourself in the future, to both sides of wedding party.  A lie that will be visible in every photo.  Are they asking anyone else to lie? What else are they lying about, other than having a brother not a sister?

It sounds like you've made the decision to accept your brother's request, and we should respect that. Hopefully you find some laughs and entertainment, and have a good time.

However, it's only one day plus a lot of photos. He should never have asked you ""do you want to go"", he should have said, ""I want you to come as 'deadname'"" because that's what he really asked - whatever his reasons.  They can cancel the wedding at any moment, guests are able to cancel at any moment as well.  I would be very upset if any member of my family defined my future relationship with them by whether or not I attended an event where I was expected to betray my principles.

Not exactly the same, however, next month I'm going to the wedding of one of my cousins (not the same as a brother, I know).  He said ""wear what you like, just don't upstage my bride."" I wouldn't have gone if he'd said anything less supportive.  I expect some of the older relatives to make nasty comments, but I'm their for him and his fiance, not the haters.

one benefit of the pandemic is that we all now have a good reason to get out of any unwanted commitments at short notice...

&#x200B;

edit: 4th July, labor day, thanksgiving, halloween, Christmas, what have you worn in the past when your brother has been there? what will you wear when you're together at the next ones? Wouldn't surprise me if your mum's very conditional support comes at the cost of future compromises at major family gatherings; having shown the lie once, you're mother will find it more difficult, not less, at the next event.  You need to be comfortable with whatever decision you make, and only you can have an idea of what the stakes are with your family, so best wishes, whatever you do.
Best of luck hon, hope you can enjoy yourself. I’ll have to get fitted for a tux for my brothers wedding soon.
I admire your patience. If you can handle this, you go for it girl. If that was me it'd be me or them, I'd tell them go frick themselves.

The sheer disrespect of telling a trans person to switch their gender is DISGUSTING. All those years fighting to be who you truly are and people just tell you to return so some people don't have to feel uncomfortable because of their own bigoted views.

Your brother and mother are implying you would ruin the wedding if you went as yourself, but it's not true, it's your brother's girlfriend's family that would ruin it. I'm sorry you have to suffer because of severe injustice, reading it made me really sad.
Not to be mean to anyone, I'm just asking, but why would their family care ? If they don't like you, what about it ? I mean, I just think that's sad for you to be uncomfortable at your brother's wedding 😕 hope your doing really great
My daughter is getting married in April and Me as her father am walking her down the aisle as my true self M2F. Im wearing a ladies pants suit and will have my hair up in a bun and my nails will be done as well as having my jewelry on. She is ok with it so I’m happy about that. It would be hard to go as a guy now since I e been on hormones for almost 5 months.
Stay strong gorgeous we all have to sacrifice for our family ...its just 1 day beautiful , know ur bro will love u for it and no matter what they love u
Yeah, don’t put up with that shit sis, you’re worth more than that
It has to be your decision. As long as you are comfortable with your decision and can live with it. Do what you need to do.
im sorry hun, this is not acceptance. no ultimatum comes from a place of love. 
it seems like your mom doesn’t accept you, rather tolerates your transition. “toning down” your identity is saddening, especially when asked to do so by family
It is your decision, if you are happy, so am I, but if was me on this same situation, I will just refuse to go to this wedding.
That sucks that you have to do that. When I went to my cousin's wedding I wore a kilt with my dad, and mine was 🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈 which was amazing, and the thing with that is, even though I'm a trans male, and it looks like a skirt, I was still seen as my identity. If I had to wear... I don't know, a dress or skirt I would've cried before we were even at the wedding.

Also I hope that if/when you get married you have the most AMAZING wedding dress adorned with lace or satin or anything because YOU DESERVE IT!
It seems like the emotional equivalent of beating you up at their wedding... Instead of them being uncomfortable you have to endure excruciating pain.

I'm rooting for you not to go but I know the power a family pressure. If you're going to do this I hope at the very least you don't gaslight yourself, and find ways ti reduce thre harm and have a safety plan for during and afterwards.
 Ie... just a few ideas to get u started...Can a trusted friend go with you? Can you wear panties and a necklace that bring you affirming feels...to tune into when dysphoria gets bad? Can you have therapy or a shopping spree or whatever will help you process and heal right afterwards?!...
I hope it went ok. I mean, OK is relative I guess, but I hope you were able to get some enjoyment, and are feeling better and more free now that it is passed! <3
Yeah, I was gonna point that out as well; glad I scrolled first.

No one I ever supported because I *genuinely supported them* ever had to strike any behind-closed-doors deals with me to earn it.  Caring about them was enough motivation.

What's the next bargain she's gonna want to strike once this behavior has been established as one that works?
The “unconditional part” is so on point. I would just talk to them, explain your side and then not go to the wedding
tbh i dont think they took this lightly, if the other family finds out it could be long-term hell... so jumping to such conclusions is dismissing allot of nuance...
There’s no way they’ll mistake me that way. I look a bit more androgynous than male thankfully but it’s also my family who would be in my face about it. They never said anything before but it’s my brothers wedding this time. The only big event since I started transitioning.
What if their families meet again? Or the wives family sees her and recognizes her? It's gonna go down at some point anyway
If my brother ever got married to someone who has (family who has) a problem with my identity, that's a them problem, not a me problem.

Trans people are always the ones that need to change for the comfort of cis people.

Obviously OP can do whatever she wants, this is her decision, but we need to stop excusing this behavior from cis people.
Agreed.   Its super uncomfortable but trying not to make any waves at your brothers wedding is probably the right choice.    I wouldn’t stay long.   Just my two cents.
Forgive me for asking, but you made a post 27 days ago saying you had just come out to your sister and your youngest brother hated your transition, but above that you’ve worn makeup everyday for 3 years and women’s clothes exclusively for over two years, and your younger brother getting married asked you a few months after he proposed (assuming late 2020/early 21) to tone down transition for his wedding; I’m just kinda wondering the dynamics of how you’d be close enough to your family to where you let them dictate what you wear to the wedding while your sister didn’t have a clue for several years what was going on.
yeah, but i also kinda get not wanting that meltdown to be at your wedding.

sucky situation with no real ""solution""
Sure. So brother I’ve lived with all my life, mildly homophobic but does his best around me and same parents. My older sister is my half sister by about 8 years I think, same dad different mom. I never really talk to them much anymore because they both live back home on the east coast. I’m in Arizona but was born in SW New York. I was never close with my half brother or sister and wanted to change that so reached out to them and we started talking, my sister anyway. I can never get Jake to pickup his phone. And I’ve wanted to tell them both for awhile anyway but since I never see them I kinda didn’t feel a pressing urge to tell them. And the wedding was a one time thing for their big day so that I don’t end up being the center of attention at their wedding, which given our families would have probably happened. All my brother asked of me was to wear pants, no skirts or dresses and I agreed. Then after talking with him about his fiancée’s family I offered to for one day only wear mens clothes for it. I was doing it as a favor/ wedding present for them. So yesterday he gave me some of his clothes to try on and they fit well so he knows what I’m wearing for the wedding.
Warn the family beforehand, establish that THEY are the ones that are NOT going to cause any problems, and just try to keep them as separated as possible. Any meltdown is on the fault of the family, not OP."	t2hfw1	trans	275	0.99	2022-02-27 06:01:00

I’ve been on 6 months on hrt by now but that nose has always been one of my biggest insecurities 😖😖-ft: Blahaj and spook season clothes 🥰		"You look very cute, and your nose fits perfectly in your face 💖
Absolutely nothing wrong with your nose at all. You are extremely cute.
your nose is awesome! i have a similar nose and i'm insecure about it too but i think we should be proud :)
Your nose is fine. I have a cis female fancing partner with the same nose, she is asian thou. And your make up is fine and you are all fine
Wow, this puts my own nose insecurities in perspective. We really do only see the flaws in ourselves, I think you're insanely cute and your nose is perfect.
Omg omg omg ok- I was so scared and insecure to look back at the post and like- ok if it’s bad then it is what it is

Until I saw a bunch of notifications and… I swear MY HEART IS MELTING 

I looked back at the mirror and now I got my gender euphoria back! Y’ALL ARE THE SWEETEST ANGELS EVER OMG 😭😭🥹
THANK YOU ♥️♥️♥️
You are beautiful, and your nose is super cute!
Much love!
I think you have a beautiful nose 😊
You look great! And Blåhaj is eternal.
You're an absolute cutie, and your nose is cute too. I don't see anything to be insecure about, beautiful 💕🥰🥰💕
Blahaj! :3
I would murder to look even half as cute as you
What, you look super cute and your nose is cute as well! Fits your face. Also very boop-able. Which I love. More people should have your nose. ❤️
Guess you must see something I don’t, looks like a cis female nose to me. 🤷‍♀️
You look amazingly cute 🥺
I should invest in anothet blåhaj

I think I'm trans but not sure	"So a bit of info, 
I'm 15, biologically male

I think I'm trans because I've imagined myself as a girl a lot and really liked wearing feminine clothing, also being referred to as a girl just kinda felt right

I'm very confused on what to do now pls help

Edit: I've decided I'm a girl, thank you so much everyone for all your help!

-Kaitlyn"	"Honestly you've thought about this a bit more than a lot of folks that post about this here. 

Remember that Trans means anyone who does not 100% identify or align with their birth gender. So could just be some exploration at your age, could be non-binary or anything else. Take some time, think on it, and explore those thoughts and feelings.
Just remember that you are you.
You don't need to tick any boxes to be you.
You might not be trans, you might not be not trans.
You might be trans now but you might not be later.
You might not be trans now but you might be later.
Explore who you are, try things, and do what makes you happy.
Be you and you'll find people who love you for you.
Just so you know, cis people dont wonder if theyre trans
This link may be helpful: https://genderdysphoria.fyi (sometimes referred to as the “Gender Dysphoria Bible”). The medical descriptions of the various dysphoria types clarified a TON of things for me. My therapist said that it’s very well written and that the medical descriptions in it are pretty accurate.
Juuuuust gonna leave this heeeeere

https://turn-me-into-a-girl.com/index.htm
hey there friend, so happy for you!! congratulations :))
Questioning is hard, just keep calm and don't rush it. I've been questioning my gender for the past 2 1/2 years and I still don't know what I am, so congrats to you I've you've figured it out. No matter what, I'm proud of you
hey dude, questioning is super difficult and i'm sorry that you're having trouble figuring out what makes you most comfortable. all i can say is, don't rush it and take some time to explore the possibilities and figure out what makes you comfortable. whether you're trans, non-binary or anything in between, you'll figure it out soon. we're here for you. ❤
If you think you might be trans, it might not be a bad idea to reach out to a supportive, knowledgeable therapist to help you decide what you want to do with these feelings. Honestly, when I first went to see my physician, I felt guilty about using resources that actual trans folks need. Turns out I am trans folks and those resources are for me, too. 🙃🏳️‍⚧️🤓😋 This is your journey! Do what works for you, and have fun!
Hi Kaitlyn! I’m Sara it’s nice to meet you! Before I knew I was trans I came to Reddit with a very similar post to yours. I’m glad you’ve found people that will help and support you and I wish you the best! 😊
Reading the edit had me like 🥺🥺🥺
Dang she already had a name ready to go. You kids are amazing i swear. Got here after the edit.
In addition to the gender dysphoria bible somebody else linked you (which you should definitely read) I'm going to pass along this [guide to gender questioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1460QwQM5S2Br8sPfv3HuKw1xrz7MBijrxv_cgoqL1F0/edit?usp=sharing), which has a bunch of other stuff you might find helpful.

I mean, it sounds like you've kind of figured it out already, but there's stuff in there that will still help you clarify and solidify your new self-understanding, give you useful language to use when talking about it, and give you ammo for the inevitable haters who will challenge what you say about your own identity. (As if they could possibly know you better than you know yourself...)
[deleted]
Be you be awesome  n get clothes shopping  find outfits that suit your body type n have fun in the shops
Hey btw I recommend not saying “biological male” because biology made you trans too which means you’re also biologically a woman.
Hi Kaitlyn!
Thank you! It's kinda been a thought for a few years but I'm not sure I'm really ready to come out to anyone
Fair enough🤣
This was actually amazing thank you so much
Nooo it won't work 😭😭
That honestly made me so happy thank you
I actually had a therapist appointment today but couldn't bring myself to bring it up
Hi Sara!
Awww
Awww thank you!
Thank you!!!
Okay!
And you don't have to. Lots of folks feel they owe it to people to come out or they aren't being honest and and hiding something. But this is a private matter, and shouldn't change how people treat you (ideally, because you are still you), so take your time with it and tell people when you are ready. 

I've only told a small amount of people myself. I could tell others but it wouldn't change anything, so not bringing it up until it seems appropriate.
And even if there are some cis people who question whether or not they are trans, when they conclude that they are not trans, they are relieved. Whereas when trans people question whether or not they are trans and conclude that they are cis, they are disappointed.
Happy to be of service, madame.
Any time
That’s really cool! I hope it went well for you.
That makes sense, thank you
I made an edit!

Found a picture of me at age 7 in my mom's clothes. It's wild how little I remember from my childhood but the feeling that I had when I put on her clothes literally hasn't faded one bit.		"I used to share clothes with my mum all the time, almost everything.  We shared shoes, trousers, shirts, whatever, even a skirt at one point. We still have a couple of things that belonged to each other actually.

But apparently she forgot all about that when I transitioned....
that smile says it all
So cute!!!
3 words, you are beautiful!!
You looked so happy! I totally get what you mean, I remember the feeling like it was yesterday.
Adorable! 😊
Your looking good in your mum gear nice hair
my family did the same thing when I was little lmao, funny how that works

Positive things that we want transfems for '' feminine '' clothing? is to force companies to make big pockets		"I'm having a really hard time giving up my 5.11 pants.
But the boy's pocket would be overpowered if Lydia also had pockets
I get euphoria dropping my phone in my non existent pocket thankyou very much
L y d i a
You made me laugh. Thank you for that :D
I go out of my way to find skirts with large pockets. Getting a bit of extra cloth and adding pockets to dresses that don't have 'em is also a good option.
I've been quite lucky and all of my dresses so far have had pockets big enough for my phone, wallet, and keys. (Though not all in the same pocket.) Having them in my pockets makes my hips look bigger too!
My brothers pockets goes nearly halfway to his knee and my pockets are here not even being able to fit my whole hand in it
I like functional pockets (feels great to find a skirt with deep pockets), but it's really not a big deal to me. I have lots of garments with good pockets, and I don't really prefer them over the rest that have tiny pockets or no pockets.  ¯\\(ツ)\\/¯

I used to extend or add pockets to garments that were lacking them, but most of the time I'd end up not using the improved pocket because carrying stuff in them would mess up the fit or look, weigh down on my imaginary hips, weren't comfortable, were hard to reach into, or things fell out too easily. A canvas tote or purse can carry so much more and is much more convenient, plus I can carry one and have all of my stuff no matter what outfit I wear.
Just love the Lydia lmao
This is so unrealistic men's pants could fit all of that and a dragon in there that and Sheogorath
""Girl pocket""
I'm wearing a dress who doesn't have any pocket...
Ngl I have seriously considered removing the pockets from my women’s clothes and adding men’s pockets
I'm just not. But I'm kind of a butch-lite lesbian anyway lol.
It's pockets all the way down! 😁
No, see, Lydia has women’s pockets. It’s not recursive
Yeah i know

MTF trans, need some wardrobe	So I'm MTF trans [15] I am not in HRT and my parents are not supportive of the LGBTQ community. Just wanted to ask for some options how ways to look more  feminine without haveing doct already existing clothes. And suggestions are greatly appreciated :)	"I'm not quite sure what you are asking but, skinny jeans, grow out your hair, clean up your eyebrows, find shirts that arent overtly feminine but androgynous. Nail polish, clear if you can't do a color.
Do you have any close female friends you trust 100%? Good friends should be willing to help you out with this kind of stuff.
Also maybe try getting into acting you should be able to convince them to let you get more varied stuff if its for a ""role"" or for a character, I would recommend cause acting is great fun and a sneaky way to be able to be yourself.
Have you gotten in contact with any local LGBTQIA groups to seek help?
This thread makes me think we need some trans clothing banks so those in transition that are low on funds can get gender affirming clothes.
Some of my favorite egg clothes were my pink v neck shirt and a pink short-sleeved button up. It really just boils down to what you can get away with, which can be surprising. In my experience, people only really see what they're trying to see. I would buy clothes from the women's section and no one would really notice my clothes. Also, I've always liked the E-girl/boy aesthetic; it's really cute and androgynous.
Someone once posted a short guide for wearing a shirt like a skirt without having to cut it or anything. I haven't tried it, so I'm not sure how well it works, but maybe it'll help. 

https://www.reddit.com/r/feminineboys/comments/mh3fvw/quick_diy_skirt_closet_edition/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share
My girlfriend did these things before she came out:
- grow your hair out (even if your parents force it to be on the shorter side of “long”, sometimes just a little bit of extra length goes a long way)
- shave body hair with the razor you have for your face (if you’re fearful of your parents finding out, start with areas that will be covered with clothes/they won’t see)
- use the more “feminine” scented “mens” products on the market (old spice has a lot of great options) you could also go for gender neutral products if you think it’ll slide under the radar
- wear more traditionally feminine colors (think pink or purple sweatshirts)
- wear briefs instead of boxers or boxer briefs, preferably no fly ones. These are mens undies that look/fit a lot like women’s ones
A lot of stores sell more ""feminine"" clothing in the men's department like H&M or Target. Getting away with floral or pink may be easier to do with super strict parents if they see it as ""mens"" clothing even though the exact same pattern may be in women's as well
If you have ‘t already start growing your hair out. Should be quite long by the time you are 18 :) Thin your brows. Maybe get your ears pierced. Shave your legs, arms and body. :)
I created /r/mtfashion for this exact question.
EDIT: this was a response to a question placed in the wrong spot
I recommend looking up some sewing tutorials. You can turn most men's clothing into feminine styles and cuts with some basic techniques. The best first project is turning jeans into short shorts.
when I was in highschool I went to goodwill and got women's blazers. ppl don't generally notice they are women's and you can feel and look more feminine without much attention.
You're a minor and have rights. Speak to an advocacy organisation or social services.
[removed]
Keep urself smooth.   Grow long hair.
I like to tuck in my shirts! It makes me feel more fem. And I love overalls as well. Little by little I’ve gotten my family to warm up to my femininity. I started slow, wearing fem colors. But also they were exposed to cishet boys who weren’t afraid to express their femininity. I suggest trying that as well, saying things like men wear their hair long too. With my family I choose to have a more masc style while i still come out to them, but I don’t fully compromise on who I am. Take whatever helps from this advice, I wish u the best 💕 just because I choose to slowly work with my family in acceptance doesn’t mean I’m saying everyone should, I hope that’s clear!
So I have been told about the trick where you can turn a pair of breifs into a braw but you have to cut in multiple places, and I know if my parents find it I will not hear the end of it
I used to have a trans man freind in my old neighborhood but I moved like 8 months ago and I cant   get my driver's permit till July. However I do love anime and star trek. So when a local comic con come to town ( we have one every year ) I could try to dress as a femal character as a ""joke""
I completely forgot about those. I'll see what I can do. Thank you for reminding me
Yes! I’d also love to donate my old masc clothes to a transmasc in need for instance. Or even some of my sports bras from my early days of transitioning that I don’t wear much anymore.
Thats so true! 

As long as your clothes don't fall too far off from what woud be considered ""male clothes"" you'll be fine.

 Im not out in public yet, but pretty much everything im wearing these days came from the women's section and i don't think anyone noticed yet.
Sorry I just saw this. Thank you so much.😁
Yea I've started growing my hair out. Idk how long I can keep it up before I have to cut I though :/
 my quality of life I think will be better if I just dont let them know. They are not aware if me being trans or omni. So they are ""caring parents"". Just rather not go into a program like that

EDIT: they are mostly ignorant and I hope that i can educate them when I graduate college and transition. Showing them that their kind is not suffering but thriving as them self
Why?
Buy a bra and keep it in your locker at school maybe?
Cosplay is a great idea maybe try to go for a more non-binary/ gender neutral or less overtly female character first to ease your parents into the idea, Like Hange Zoe from AoT they are great, although you could probably convince them to let you cosplay as Mikase Akerman as she isn't that overly feminine and I assume they dont kbow much about anime probably won't be able to tell she is a girl from just a few images. You could also do something Like Shiek from Zelda as many people still dont know that its actually Princess Zelda in disguise.
Say you want hair like aquaman that could work
That's another way. Just don't put it off forever!
Cant have a bra my parents won't let me get a job
Thanks for the advice will do
That...... that is probably one of the best suggestions I have ever received thank you
Will do :)
Try fiver and see what odd jobs you might be able to do?
No probs !
Sadly my parents won't let me have a debit account either.
Then get cash app, paypal, venmo, and have it sent to someone elses house.
Have you heard of a magical thing called Dogecoin?

Yea that may work. I have one person in mind that I could ship it to. Thank you for your help

I have felt the best and worst since becoming trans	"I am not sure if other people relate to this, but realising I am trans made my life a lot better and worse at the same time. Thinking about change, feminisation, clothes, hormones, voice training and all of that make me extremely excited. Especially trying out things and planning what I can do makes me happy. To that, I feel a lot more confident, comfortable and happy socialising. I feel more comfortable with myself and my personality. Everything seems a bit better with the possible change and future.

Still, my mental stability has suffered a lot through the constant pressure of my mother and other things. So, I am just often trying to somehow manage my mother and make her stop using my dead name and being toxic. Since despite her not stopping me, she still is far from helping me and makes a lot of things harder, more exhausting and generally worse. To that, my dysphoria got a lot worse since I noticed what I didn't like aka. my biological gender and what made me often uncomfortable in the past but only noticed now.

So now, I am constantly switching between very happy, gender-dysphoric, stressed, pressured, excited and everything in between."	"I feel you. I feel much happier and put together on my hormones. But the anxiety my parents give me is crushing me.
All I can tell you is that you don't need permission from women to be one. It is why ftm trans also struggle with being masculine. Try to remove your programmed desire for approval from women (specifically your mother) and you will find more freedom and less concern. You aren't alone.
Oof, I feel this on every level...

I look forward to the day where I can reflect on this version of me with kindness and love, and let me know that things will work out and that we will be okay.
The thing that you told about you mother is actually a mental abuse. If somebody drops a small amount of poison to you food, not enough to kill you but enough for you to not feel well - it is abuse, even if it is unconscious. Try to talk to your mother about that she may not realize that by herself.

If all the words you hear only gaslighting your mind - it is abuse! 

It is a reason why I haven’t been told my mother yet (and I am not teen for more than decade and live my life for years separately).

And yes - my life becomes much more happier and easy and much much more harder and depressing at the same time! 

The only thing I know for sure - I will be more happy as a “sad girl” than a “sad boy”! 

Wish you luck and all the best. 

P.S. there are a lot of buzz about youtube channel “philosophical tube” and you should definitely check it out.  There are several interesting videos out there, also a dedicated to abuse and also about trans coming out. Highly recommend- it made my life as trans a bit better!
god same, since coming to terms with my identity i constantly switch between happy and excited and like, drop dead exhausted.
Thank you for sharing. I'm sure all of us are going thru ie have gone thru similar issues.  I, like you just read and comment on others posts but it helps soo much to see so many beautiful lady's posting the same things I deal with.  I am looking for a website to order hormones from since the fake estrogen I've been taking isn't doing anything.
The first thing I'd recommend is to start looking for somewhere to move to. From my own personal experience, living with toxic parents is a hell in itself.
Unfortunately some people who see that being Trans. Is a movement - wether it is or is not at all, May relate it to mens rights movements as anti circumcision/frenectomy and as a challenge to the medical and pharmaceutical and many other industries or organizations that profit massively from the act and resources from foreskin (skin grafts,luxury face cremes, training, reduction in required distribution of educational resources for care of the male prepuce, lowered rates of divorce,ptsd etc, etc it unfortunately produces (in the case of unconcented instances); 

Furthermore it has been conceptualized that people ""assigned"" male at birth who transition to female etc may challenge the role/expectations of natal women... It is also an increase in competition for natal women aswell as a reduction in resources for the primarily male occupied work industries ie:Skilled Trades etc...

I digress....
Maybe that's why I gained weight and my emotions are all over the place.
I sadly don't have hormones :C but yush, I understand that and I hope it works out. Eventually, there will be a solution, just it might be hard or not so nice, especially if it means separating or trying to avoid certain people.
I know and I am happy being me, just my mother is just concerning and hard on me since it's just annoying to deal with that almost every day
I hope it just gets better, but I somehow know it will, just there is still a lot in the way and a lot to go through
It might be, but it's just hard since I am unsure and it's more complicated than just her being bad since she also tries in a way, but it's not working and she still keeps on with her opinion. Still, I am looking for a therapist and that I can talk with them and my mother about it to maybe make her realise some things. And thank you :3 I will look into that youtube channel if I find time since currently, I have college classes
I feel the exhaustion. I need some vacation from being at home
Oh, I would really not recommend hormones online, since hormone therapy can cause serious side effects if not done properly under medical observation and correct medicine."	njwvt5	trans	258	1.0	2021-05-24 12:32:21

Got some new clothes for christmas :) i still look like a butch girl instead of a guy but thats the trans life ig		"I totes thought you were a dude. Just saying...
you look like an 11 year old boy
You kidding? Scrolling past your pic I definitely saw a guy. I just went back up to check what the post was about. Didn't expect it to be on a trans sub.
nah you look like a soft guy tbh. i know a few and they’re cis but look similar. 
MTF Bicep > Looking more like a butch lesbian every day < FTM Bicep


I disagree with that statement. You look more manly than I do.
You totally look like a guy, a young one but a guy nonetheless. 
11/10 would accept a number from but be too shy to approach 
you look more like a guy than I do
I literally thought you were AMAB from the picture. 
Look like a dude to me.
no, you look male to me. pretty young, but still male
happy holidays⛄️
13 tear old boy is what I would say! But I'm 16 and look 13 lol
You look like a gay 15 year old cis boy or a straight 11 year old cis boy
Faces are a trip. I could make you up and you'd be gorgeous or put you in dudes clothes and if you talked and acted like a dude, I'd see dude. When I flashed on the pic, I thought, young guy.  
Handsome guy
For a brief moment I thought this was a picture of my (male) cousin and my heart skipped a beat.  So, yeah, you pass...!
You look like a guy to me!
I saw the pic and thought you were a guy.
I don’t know dude!, you look like a cute guy to me. 
you look great!! ❤️❤️
How old are you? You look similar to a male cousin of mine in his teens.
Definitely a dude.
You look male to me 😎 stay cool my fellow trans sibling
U look great :)
Hey, I’m a little late, but just so you know, I didn’t realize this was a post in r/trans and I literally thought you were just some guy while scrolling past. If that helps at all :)
YOUR EYELASHES omgg!!
I totes knew* you were a guy :)
Thank u! But ur probably just being nice
This hurt im 15 shjsj
Same here!
I thought i kinda looked my age but ig not haha
I only text my mom im sorry
I didnt know sexuality added age lmao
Me too lol.
15
Damn it. How did I fail that!? Thank you!

Yes. I totes knew op is a guy.
No. I'm not like that. You look like a very young dude. 
Nah fr you look like a dude. A 12 year old dude but still.... a dude. You’re gonna pass great (and look your age) after some time and T.
Can’t speak for who you replied to, but I opened the picture before I read the title and I 100% saw you as a guy :)
I see like a 13 yo boy, not butch girl. 
at least you pass. I never pass and when I do people think I'm 13 (I'm 20 haha)
it's normal to look younger than you are when you're trans. Just wait til you get the right hormones and it'll make you look a lot older just in few months.
I've known 13-15 year olds that look like that no joke. You'll be fine dude
same
Well, to be more specific I guess. You could be a 15 year old cis twink or an 11 year old cis boy
Then you’re doing great! Keep going, bro 💖
Sorry, to clarify I'm not criticising - I know that you were just saying you read them as a cis guy initially. I've done the same thing before unthinkingly. Just taking the liberty of translating for you since we all know we'll take the least charitable interpretation on any comment about our genders haha 
Actually, you're half right. If I have something nice or constructive to say, I will say it. If I don't have something nice or constructive to say I keep my mouth shut. 
I dont pass well irl i promise especially when i talk. I just try to shut up as much as i can but yea hrt is magic
ah same. i try to avoid smiling as well because it makes my face look a lot more feminine whichs sucks.

guess whose new femme clothing arrived today! :D		"Are you... standing on the edge of your bath tub?
additional info: 

-The skirt has *pockets*

-it does the spinny

-im not small, just fairly far from the mirror

-im standing on the bathtub because the mirror is small and you wouldnt be able to see the stuff otherwise

-i wont be doing selfies with my face in them any time soon because dysphoria
I love the color of your skirt. Bought a blazer recently in a similar color, never would have thought a month ago that I would wear that color but love it.
I love purple! and that skirt is so cute!
congratulations 🎉
Can I ask where you got your shirt? I really like the design on it. You look awesome!!
i... is that the edge of the bath?
Nice! I love it :)
Mine came yesterday :D

It's so nice when they arrive and you can finally wear them. Cute clothing girl! <3333333
as explained in my additional info post, yes i am!

the mirror is pretty small so you wouldnt be able to see what i wanted to show off (skirt and net) otherwise
saaaame

i never thought i would wear anything purple except for my hair (which is black atm, but im hoping to get it either purple, blonde, or blue, soon) ans then i saw the skirt online and fell in *love* with it

it was the only color that had my size, too lol
yesss!
i cant find the specific link but its from boohooman.com

technically its a website for mens fashion, hut theyre so comfy and oversized! if you just avoid things that say ""MAN"" or ""OfficialMAN"" on them, you wont have any trouble

i get most of my shirts and hoodies from there because it just kinda fits everyone, the designs are good, and its high quality 

thank you, thats the first time that i, myself also thought that i look good :)

edit: typos & clarity
dw i held on to the ceiling as to not fall over
me too!
yasss! thank you very much :3

Just a trans guy who need help	"Hi ! I'm Eddie, I hope you have a great day :) 

So, I need some advice, I'm ""young"" (under 16 years old), FTM (AFAB) nobody knows that I'm trans. 

It's almost summer holidays in France (I'm french, this also explains my bad english) and I'm very dysphoric when I am wearing a swimsuit. But I prefer one piece swimsuit, it's very strange. Have you tips to reduce dysphoria ? :c I really don't know how I'm going to hold on. 

I also plan to buy myself a colorful shirt because it's sooooo cool you know, do you knows good website without clothes sorted by gender? Or at least unisex, who could very well pass for a trans boy? And not very expensive of course. 

Thanks you in advance ! 🏳️‍⚧️🥰"	"Hawaiian shirts are your friends
When feeling masc, I put swim shorts over top of a one piece. If you’re closeted, they sell some in most womens sections, they’re kinda short, though
Bonjour Eddie. Je suis cishet donc j'ai pas trop d'idées sur comment t'aider. Je voulais juste te souhaiter un bon été. J'espère qu'il sera aussi bon que possible. Et ton anglais n'est pas mauvais du tout. Tout mon soutien xx
swim binders exist! I usually get them from spectrum outfitters. Otherwise gc2b is a good site. They have them short and long (covering your stomach) Maybe tell your guardians it's like a surf suit. They are quite expensive though - and I suggest buying one size up.
If you can't do that, wear a shirt over your swimsuit. Special swimming shirts also exist:) and as an excuse you could say you're afraid your shoulders will burn.
anyways, summer sucks indeed. and I wish you good luck during this summer! dress like a middle aged man on vacation with those hawaiian shirts, and it makes the dysphoria a little less. may we wear big hoodies soon
I wear shortie wetsuits at the beach(unless I’m surfing then I use my good full one) - just the cheap light summer ones you can get at places like Decathlon. If I’m not going in the water I tend to wear a rash vest & surf shorts but I’m guessing that wouldn’t really be any help for you.

I did also have a shorts one piece swimsuit from there too for the public pool but I used to wear a baggy T-shirt on top if I was at the beach to stop getting sunburnt - that might be an option?
I know you said you prefer a 1 piece, but this might be helpful anyways, so I figured I'd throw it out there. I found some swim trunks and a compression top from tomboyx that does well with compressing but not too much (so you can still breathe while swimming). I then got a button up sun and water resistant shirt to put on over it, so if I felt like it I could go in the water with the shirt or without. For me, my dysphoria and confidence can fluctuate depending on how many people are at the swimming location. All in all, the whole outfit cost me about $60, $20 per piece of the outfit. Keep in mind I'm in the US though and prices keep going up and up right now. I hope this helps!
Ton anglais est bon :) and yes Hawaiian shirts! For swimsuit, one piece but t shirt on top can reduce dysphoria (and also help with sun exposure). Look into surf suits too, they cover a lot more and can be bought in a one piece.
This year long sleeve and binder like swim tops are popular! Those do help me a bit along with getting swim shorts! I hope this helps and good luck!
I used to wear those high impact sports bras and a size up rashguard swim shirt and straight cut (ladies) swim shorts. So if anyone asked, I would say I'm wearing them for their UV protection. Perfect ""reason"" without having to tell others about dysphoria.
Swim shorts on top of swim suits can be helpful, if you wnat you can also get a swim tshirt
Instead of wearing a regular swimsuit top, I wear a rash guard. If you don’t know what rash guards are, look them up! If you need an excuse to ask your parents for one, just say you want to protect your skin from sunburns
I don’t really know how to help but I feel like you should get the shirt. I have a good feeling it’ll look amazing on you
There are bikini bottoms that are like shorts instead of a small thing (you know like boys wear but for girls, in case you don’t want your parents to notice). And maybe you can use a swimming shirt on the upper part.
Honestly I think it might help to just say you’re worried about getting sunburnt, etc to your parents, use that to justify wearing a swim shirt and shorts aka less revealing / gendered clothes???
[deleted]
I don't know if you can get one online, but there is a company that sells vintage looking one piece swimsuits that are gender neutral. It's called Beefcake Swimwear. Hope this helps!
I recommend getting something like a swim trunk and top combo with a swim shirt over it, that’s what I’ve heard one of my ftm friends do and it helped him
What I’d do is wear a rashguard (google says téméraire but I don’t think that’s right, it’s a swim shirt) and some athletic shorts, like the kind you’d use for running. They’re made of fabric similar to swimsuits and won’t get heavy with water. This combo is very similar to regular guys outfits without outing you as FTM
Hey there.  


Any reason you can't just buy a shirt in the guy's section online? I get that it's hard in the store, but the Internet should be fine? I'm thinking like Uniqlo, where you can pick it up at a store and return it online or at a store within 30 days. If that's what you prefer.  


Anyway, good luck. Courage mon reuf
hi eddie! i recommend wearing swim trunks and a swim binder under one of those mens swim shirts. its a pain but no dysphoria!
heyy, i don't really know how to help u with your problem :( i'll ask to some of my trans friends if they have advices for you ! 

by the way, i'm also a french queer person x) 

jte souhaite une bonne journée/soirée :)
Yep, I think I'm going to buy that kind of shirts
Thanks you, I will take a look
That’s what I do, I have two pairs of swimming shorts. Also any button down T-Shirt with patterning like stripes, Hawaiian patterns, or even weird things (I have a shirt that is covered in cards and dogs playing poker). Those tend to make me feel more masc without me being out.
Merci beaucoup :) Passe un très bon été également
For the swim binder, my parents are really curious and I'm afraid they discover that I'm trans 😔
I will check for swimming shirts !!
Thanks you a lot, I hope your summer will be great !
Thanks you a lot !!
Thanks you ! 😄 I will check
Thankkks 😁
I think I'll ask my parents to buy me this. Thank you very much for the answer
Thanks for the excuse haha it's perfect!   
And thank you for your suggestion, I'm going to check it out
I hadn't really noticed that this kind of thing existed, so I'll look into it, thanks for the help!
Omgg thanks you 😃
Aww thanks, finally I took the shirt. I can't wait for it to arrive at my house
Thank you for taking the time to suggest something ! It's perfect 🥰
I think i'm going to do that indeed. Thank you very much
Farmer Johnny or unisuit sometimes.
Thanks to both of you, I will check this !!
I didn't know that at all ! Thank you !!
I will try i think 🥰
:0
I will look for it. Thanks you
I can't because of my parents, i'm not out and i'm afraid of their reaction, so I endure discreetly.   
I don't knoww Uniqlo, I think I'll check out the site. Do you know if they have store in France ?   
Merci mon reuf :)
I'll check it out. I'm afraid my parents ask questions if I'm piling on the swimsuits
Thaaanks you, keep me informed plz ! 🥰
Most binders could pass as a sports bra so your parents may not be able to tell what it is. Rashguards are tops that are worn by all genders. They’re on the pricier side in the US so I don’t know how that changes with Euros, but TomboyX is gender neutral and has swim tops and binders.
It’s no problem. We have to stick together!
It’s gonna look amazing on you and I already know your gonna love the heck out of it
I just looked. Unfortunately Beefcake swimsuits are too expensive for me... :(
Also I don’t know if someone has commented this but buy Hawaiian shirts
Oui il y a des Uniqlo en France, j'y vais souvent. Beaucoup à Paris et dans la majorité des grandes villes je pense. Je sais pas où tu es situé, mais j'espère que tu pourras faire du store pick-up.

[https://www.uniqlo.com/fr/fr/content/store-locator.html](https://www.uniqlo.com/fr/fr/content/store-locator.html)

Bon courage pour la situation avec tes parents en tout cas, j'espère que ça va s'arranger :(

(je suis une meuf trans, au passage \^\^)
yep. you can always say you're cold or just insecure or smth. (btw im also eddie i think we have a cool name!)
Thanks you 🧡🧡
Oh darn maybe if you have a family member who knows how to sew and you can do a project together and make vintage swimsuits?
Yep, this is what I do. If you want to see what shirt I took, tell me.
Merci beaucoup j'irai voir alors !
Et désolé pour le mégenrage, j'espère ne pas t'avoir trop blessée 😓
Nobody knows :( I have mediocre family"	vl432s	trans	255	0.98	2022-06-26 12:52:35
I suspect the child I’m babysitting is trans; I want to help them.	"Prefacing this with using they/them because I am lost as to what to use!

As far as I am aware, this child is 12 and female, but they wear mens clothes, have a trans flag ribbon and gay flag ribbon on their backpack… until recently. But no mention of being trans or gay and parents have not mentioned anything but would definitely be loving regardless!

Today was a really bad day, they didn’t want to do anything they normally like with me, said they wanted a certain food for dinner and then when we got there, didn’t eat. I offered to make baked goods at home, play nerf guns, everything. Nothing works. They hid all evening.

When the mom came home, she told the child not to be rude and that I was worried about them, but I clarified that everyone has a bad day and it’s okay!

Bottom line is that the strange depressive episodes and the ribbons taken off their backpack is lining up with all the new bills in Florida and Texas (we’re in a blue state though). But I think it’s weighing on them, and maybe body image issues too. 

For context, I’m white and bisexual but very new to the community, and the child is fab and mixed race Asian and Black. And I truly hope I used the correct language here, but I’m just looking for some advice or guidance. Everyone says I should wait for them to tell me, but it’s starting to seem like there’s possible mental health issues and I’m worried. I’ve also known them for about 2 years, watching them on and off. Thank you so much in advance!"	"Find ways for the topics to come up naturally in conversation and make sure they know that you're supportive and safe to discuss such with. Never push or even ask leading questions. Let them reveal what they will or won't about their personal life/feelings
Going through the same situation with the 13 yr old I babysit/tutor. It’s a little different because I’m trans myself but anyway here’s my advice:

-don’t mention anything to the parent(s). If the parent(s) ask you, you don’t know (unless the kid specifically asks you to help them come out). 

-get a pin or something for your bag if you’re comfortable with that

-listen to them if they bring up anti-trans legislation, transphobia, etc. but don’t bring it up yourself. Instead, maybe (casually) mention some good news involving trans people. If the kid brings up any of the bad stuff, don’t say things like “at least that’s not happening here,” instead go for sympathy and say something like “That’s awful and very upsetting. Do you want us to look for ways we can help?”

-But most of all, be an open, neutral and affirming adult who is not their parent(s)/friends. This one is really all you have to do. Listen but don’t pry, but at the same time show that you’re supportive. 

You already sound like a great person for this kid to be around - Thank you. I’m sending you both strength and love.
Conspicuously read a a pro trans book of some type. Make up a trans masc friend. Hell, wear a trans ribbon/bracelet etc. As a parent to a teen though, she might be so in her head about the current political reality, that she may not notice. You might have to get real blatant with it.
Put a Pride pin on something of yours. 
Bring a book about lgbtq to read
Show acceptance without voicing it and show that you are safe. 

Outside of that, I wouldn’t approach other than being their friend and showing them you are safe an ally or a member of lgbtq+
approach it purely from a mental health angle

they may be a trans and lgbt ally but also there's a chance you're dealing with a cracking egg. it's a really scary time and attacking it head on is likely to make them run right back into the closet. voice your concerns as a fellow ally and see where they need help navigating what is happening to their trans and lgbt friends - cuz that might be all that this is

but

if you are dealing with a trans masc or non-binary person in crisis you have to demonstrate that any third party from the two of you is someone to be loved and protected from this onslaught. only then would someone be confident showing that the problem isn't in fact a third person but they themselves being directly affected - not just in crisis for fear for their friends.
Being trans can be a mind f*ck for a kid (at least it was for me). Even if you show your support, (which can be hugely impactful) they still might not want to come out yet.
She might be also tomboy lesbian and not trans! I'm trans woman Butch lesbian and also wearing men's clothes mostly, shoot guns, working around house with chainsaw, riding motorcycle etc.. Clothing is saying nothing about your gender identity.
i would maybe mention my sexuality/gender, make it known they are safe to come out if they feel ready, but like not just like say it explicitly, if you know what i mean?
I would just asked them about their flag and let them lead the conversation, and let them know you are LGBT as well so they know they they are in a safe space.  I wouldn’t lead the conversation, just let them talk.
Trust your instincts, but ultimately the parents are responsible (and liable) for their children's health.

Thank you everyone for your comments! You were all so helpful and accepting of my questions!

An update: the mom told me she knew the child is trans and they’re being very accepting but also trying to let them explore without judgement :)
Yes, I'd simply comment how much I like their pins and ask if they know anyone that's trans and kinda go with the flow
You're their baby sitter not their therapist. A bisexual adult woman talking about sexuality with a 12 year old isn't the right move in my opinion. If you feel the need to discuss these topics, by all means do so. The child isn't mine, but if it was my child I'd be furious if the babysitter I hired had that talk with my 12 year old.
Be careful!!!!
People already think lgbtq’s are pushing our agenda on their children.
Yeah that’s what I’ve been doing, it just doesn’t feel like enough 😞
Yeah I second this. I know this feeling very well. The only reason I will hide is if I'm unsure of people's Intensions and thoughts. I won't make a sound. It's fear of ridicule and gossip.
Your message is really helpful and really sweet, thank you! I’m trying!
I think you misunderstood, the child I’m taking care of is likely trans. I’m bi
Fr I was so far in the closet, I would've supported anyone I'd known if they came out to me, but I couldn't find myself in there
I understand that feeling but trying to nudge them into saying it can be super uncomfortable and stressful for them 

Last year My mom (whomst I do not speaketh to anymore for separate reasons) kept asking me why I was wearing makeup, like asking loudly and making a scene. I think she would have been kinda supportive and I think everyone else would have been okayish maybe but still I didn’t even know my makeup was visible. Anyway she told me she was “fine if I wanted to be a he/she” 

I had a slight bit of makeup visible and didn’t notice and now I’ve not spoken to my mother in a year that was just the final “I need to leave” thing for me
It's more than a lot of people get. If they aren't cis they'll figure things out and ask questions. It's really best to just make sure they know you're safe to talk to
Srsly some kind of trans support item will 100 percent signal to them that you are safe
I don't think they misunderstood. They're saying the pins on the kid's backpack may just indicate that they're trying to be openly an ally, but it's also possible that they are dealing with internal questions regarding their own gender identity and that is most likely terrifying for them. 

They're trying to suggest that you indicate support for a different trans person, probably a trans masculine person as that seems like what you may be dealing with so this kid can know you would be supportive without trying to seem like you're attempting to figure out them out yourself.
u/ABewilderedPickle hit the nail on the head - i knew exactly what you meant and you need to show support for trans folk so that they either confide in you and you can provide help based on the fact they are trans or they show their hand and they turn out to not be trans - just a very-very concerned ally"	t3xnkt	trans	253	0.97	2022-03-01 03:06:28
a semi-detailed story of what my girlfriend and I did when she came over these last 2 days.	"So the past 2 days, my girlfriend (18MtF) visited me (also 18MtF) and we did a lot of fun things.

She arrived on Sunday at noon by train and I went to pick her up at the train station. It was really hot outside so I had to hide behind a cabin where people can sit and wait for the train. When she arrived, I ran towards her and jumped into her arms as she had said that she would like this. We walked home and when we arrived we went to my room and played video games together. After that, we went to lay in bed and we cuddled and kissed. At about 19.00 my mom called us to come eat and we ate burgers, and they were very tasty. When dinner had finished, we said our goodnights and went to my room again. We repeated the cuddling and kissing and we eventually just fell asleep in my tiny bed that can barely fit me, let alone me and my girlfriend, who is way taller than me.

The next morning, I had to get up early to get help studying from some old man who taught physics because in august, I have to redo my exam. My girlfriend stayed in bed and I had to suffer. An hour later, I came back into my room and I tried to sleep a little more because you know we didn’t sleep for shit. At about noon, we went downstairs to eat something and to prepare for a visit to a nearby city to get bubble tea. We went to the city, got the bubble tea, and then stayed for a couple hours longer because we wanted to buy cute clothes. My girlfriend told me she was really awkward in the women’s section but I helped her get through it without much issues. We got her a cute skirt with flowers on it, and also a crop top to go with the skirt. We also got matching bracelets and they look a little like the lesbian flag which is pretty epic, I think. When we got home, she immediately changed into the new clothes and she felt really good. What I saw was pure gender euphoria and it was contagious, because I was really happy for her. And, to make things even better, my sister donated some old clothes to me because they were too small for her and we both looked through it and we found some cool clothes. My girlfriend found a really cute dress with flowers on it and some shorts she liked. I didn’t find anything I liked but that’s okay. After this all passed we ate dinner again and went to bed.

In bed, my girlfriend told me a lot of cute things, she told me about her plans for the future, that she wanted to be a stay-at-home wife for me and that when I would come home from my job, she’d have hot chocolate milk ready for me and that we would have a dog and a cat and it seemed so perfect to me. We then tried to sleep but allegedly, I made it really difficult for her as I claimed more of my tiny bed than I should have. I also woke up a few times from a bad dream, or at least, that’s what my girlfriend says. She also wrote me a poem which she sent me on discord:

>one day this  
one day that  
i'm tired of dreaming  
you're here  
right here  
and i have to ask  
will you...  
be mine?  
be mine forever  
please, my beautiful girl

She also wrote me another poem:

>ahhh 2am  
unable to sleep  
writing a shitty ""poem""  
the light's on  
i'm wide awake  
she's pressing against me  
i have zero space  
tho i do like feeling her body  
pressing against mine

Next morning (today), we woke up at around 11.30 and we ate cereal and then prepared to go to the train station to put her on her train home. We eventually left my house and we walked to the train station. We arrived a little early, so we sat down and hugged. When the train eventually arrived, we hugged and kissed goodbye and she left.

Obviously I’m sad now because she isn’t here anymore but it’s okay because according to my calculations, she’ll be back by next week or so.

So yeah, this was a semi-detailed story of what my girlfriend and I did when she came over these last 2 days.

Later, nerds."	"awwww, you 2 seem really cute together 🥺🥺
so cute, love reading about girls in love. I hope you two keep going strong, you obviously mean a lot to her.
That was adorable!!!

This is so sweet lol I'm just smiling reading about it. Happy for both of you <3

I just want a place to exclusively read really cute sapphic t4t stories. I don’t need anything sexy, just cute and adorable. Something to make my heart melt. That is all.
Good luck wit hthe exam.

I dunno, I can see you pulling off Finn.
Wtf? If you wanna be Finn, you're Finn. Picking your name is about doing what makes you most comfortable, not catering to the preferences of others. It's *your* name, not your friend's name.
My son's chosen name is Finn. I say go for what your heart desires.
Bro, go with Finn if you feel it!

It suits you!
Hmn what about Ren/Reynold? Idk why but that feels like it fits

Oo or actually, what about Finnegan?
Nah forget that. You must be a Finn cause only a Finn would feel like one.
I like Finn but you’re also giving Zach and Caleb
I think finn is a very nice name and it would fit you perfectly in my opinion 😊
I like Finn for you!
If you want to be Finn then you absolutely should be Finn. Another good one could be Michael. There’s like a million Michaels so it’s pretty common.
finn is nice ! i saw your replies and alex is good as well, also maybe max, matthew, or milo? idk i feel m vibes
you can be whatever name you want! your physical appearance does not bind you specific names
If you feel like a Finn then you are a Finn!
Finn suits you 100%
What about Finneas? You could definitely pull that one off.
I’m getting Harper! Also love Finn :)
I could see Finn/Finnegan. You also look a bit like a guy I know named Jaylen (Jay for short)
Hey Finn, your second outfit is plenty masc at least. Don't worry too much about what your friend thinks suits you. You know you.
I love the name finn!
Call yourself whatever you like but I agree u don’t suit Finn. Maybe Marcus.
Finn fits you! But I’m also getting Jacob vibes
don’t listen to your friend. i asked my friends about coming up with a new name for me and i got one *from* them, but they never discouraged me from any name i was considering. you look great as finn :)
I agree. I kinda like Fin for you.
that friend told me i'd suit junior more but idk, i dont think junior is my cup of tea
ahahahaha fair!! i was considering a bunch of names anyways since i want to legally change my name this summer. i go by alex irl and finn online and just wanted to see which im more comfortable with or if people had any other cool suggestions!!
thank you! i'll consider it :))
thank you!!
oooo okay i might try it out, thank you!@
Came here to second Zach. But if you like Finn OP, then take it. It's a good name
thank you!!
ahh okay, thank you sm!!!
omg i kinda love milo. i'm gonna try it out!!
ahaha thank you!!
thank you!!
ooo maybe!!
ah thank you!!
ooo okay, thank you!
ahaha thank you, my careers advisor said i dont dress very masc so i thought i still wasnt doing too well in that aspect. thank you tho!!
omg ive never considered marcus, i might try it and see!!
ooo ive never thought of jacob, thank you i'll see!!
ahaha dont worry he wasnt telling me not to go for finn. he just said he couldnt see me as a finn & suggested junior. he didnt mean any harm!!
Eww. Your friend doesn't know what they're talking about. Finn suits you perfectly and Junior is like the kid from Breaking Bad, right? Um no.
While it’s good to get suggestions, try not to worry about if others don’t think your favorite name fits. It don’t matter, what matters is that it makes you feel as amazing as you should!!!! Which should be very amazing to be clear, cause ya are :3
Your name is your choice, and yours alone!

People can offer suggestions if you ask for them, but ultimately the choice is yours.

If Finn speaks to you, then that’s your name!
You got this! :))

Fun trivia of the day: in Celtic legends, Finn is a heroic badass who was renamed (from Demme to Finn/Fionn) after he gained knowledge that made him very powerful
thank you both! i've never considered zach. i might think about it
No problem!

also, I meant a guy I know, not just a I know. Sorry about that :)
It can be super hard to dress your gender when you're only just out anyway. It comes with time. You're not going to grow a beard on day 1 either.

And even if you want to dress feminine, that's fine. You can express your gender however you want.
lollll thats what i thought of 😭 and the kid from the cleveland show
aww you're so sweet, thank you ♡

Is it time for a Trans Disney Princess?	"Hey y’all, just a thought that came up while watching the post credits scene from Frozen. The snow monster outs in the crown and seemingly gets euphoria from secretly wearing such a feminine article of clothing.

Do y’all think it’s time Disney did an animated movie staring a transgender character? Perhaps the prince falls for a princess but reveals that they’re trans and the big rift is the fight between the Princess and her unsupportive family?"	"A trans princess would be nice for representation.

It would have to be done pretty carefully though.
I love the idea of there being a trans disney princess ...On paper.

But I feel like disney would most likely get it wrong and end up making up look bad/like a problem/like a burden/etc.
They have not even made a canonically gay princess yet, so I don't think they will just take the leap. Also: I think they would probably do a terrible job at it. I used to love Disney when I was a small child but as I grew I realized just how harmful and socially regressive a lot of the messaging in their movies was.

Their support for anti-lgbtq+ politicians while claiming to be against the very agendas their money goes to push is also disturbing. All of this in the service of expanding intellectual property rights, opposing workers' rights, and general profiteering.

Disney making a trans princess would be evidence that it's more profitable for them to do so than not to, and that would be a good sign for us, but it would not be because they care about us as people.
True.

Maybe I’m just wanting more representation like the trans npc character in Horizon Forbidden West
Disney has a crap record of proper representation and is very anti lgbtq
My good Trans Friends may I interest you in the story of Princess Ozma from Wizard of Oz? 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Princess_Ozma

So she was born as a girl but magically transformed into a boy (and raised as such till teen years) and has to figure out a way to become a girl again. Oh and Ozma has a close relationship with Dorothy.

So quite some genderbending, and it could be read as how Trans people are truly their gender from the start but have to deal with the reality of not being able to be that gender till later on in life.
Lol no, how long did it take to get a black princess? Disney will do a trans princess decades past the point it would be politically relevant. Shit they don't even have a gay princess yet.
Have you not been reading news articles for the past month????
Disney with the star character being trans? In a *movie*? HAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHABABABABABBAAHAHAHHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHAHA
Or maybe a transmasc character, since we get much less representation. Basicaly invisible
It would be nice for the many Hinted at LGBT characters in Disney to come out officially. Mulan, Luca, Elsa, Ursula, Pleakley, Timon and Pumbaa, ... there are a bunch of gay bait Disney character that need to comeout of the closet.
I’d rather have a trans character in a Pixar movie, I think they’d probably do a better job representing our community than Disney animation.
With someone like bob chapek in charge? Not gonna happen in our lifetimes.
Yes I would love to see this. I have honestly lost hope for Disney because of how they treated some franchises like Star Wars for example. But having this type of film actually happen would reignite that spark of hope. Hopefully they come around one day.
I signed some confidentiality agreement so I can't say much about it, but I auditioned for a movie as the main character, whom is trans. I think that's about all I can say 😂. The small snippet of script I got seems like Disney understands trans problems and wants to shed light unto their everyday lives, but knowing how Disney has handled LGBT representation in the past (Censoring a lesbian couple in the Love God episode of Gravity Falls, the whole Priya situation, etc) I'm a bit worried 😅

Edit: I'm confident that that's all I can say about the movie because that's what was on the advert: ""Disney movie with a trans main character""
It wasn't that long ago they made ""Brave"", and it was a huge step (for them) just making the princess someone with agency.
On one hand, I want it to happen because the world is ready for this. 

On the other hand, while the world is ready for this, Disney is not ready to do it right.
Y'all are talking about this like you don't read the news or listen to it. Disney corporate president Karey Burke has two trans/non-binary kids and has been taped saying that Disney is openly starting to push for lgbt in all of it's films, shows and parks.
that would be amazing, unfortunately i think we are at least a few decades from disney even considering trans content, seeing as they don't even accept hints towards gay characters
YES YES YES!!!!
no main disney character will be explicitly trans for at least another decade, and even then the plot will absolutely not focus on them being trans, and i am *certain* they will not be a princess. better off looking at smaller media and creating it ourselves tbh. disney will only pick it up once it's profitable.
Disney cares too much about foreign markets to push any lgbtq princess for the time being i’m guessing
Noooooo the upsetero heteros would be oh so upset we can't have their fragile snowflake feelings be hurt /j
We don't even have a gay princess.
Fuck no. Disney is a bloated monopoly in the making and they’re “representation” of often back handed. Disney attempts to copyright National stories and mythological figures. Also, it’s clear Disney’s higher ups do not care about LGBT+ issues and I don’t wanna see the backlash that would cause and they’d almost certainly do it badly.

Edit:

Like seriously can we stop begging megacorps like Disney for crumbs of “representation”. I think a world where Disney makes a trans character is an awful world. Disney is an awful corporation and I don’t want them getting any credit for LGBT issues when the higher up are clearly homophobic and Disney has extremely fucked legacy.
Disney is a gigantic corporation, don't believe they would do it right, probably just for the initial pink money like every corporation that size.
If only Disney cared about social justice more than money.
Disney wont even add gay characters i doubt they will write a trans person into a movie for a long time
If they’re going to do a story about trans character, they should consult with members of the community during the process. They’ve done that for films like Encanto and Coco and they even had those members as part of the creative team. Imagine if they made a film black experience but only had white people in their creative team. That would send red flags!
That would be interesting, but that will have to be done extra carefully.

It would be quite interesting for a trans Disney Princess to be a thing, though!
Not Disney but a Disney inspired movie or show with any queer rep would be awesome. I still think the whole either ""a knight takes off the helmet after saving the princess for it to be a girl "" or like "" a prince is supposed to be married but falls for a boy who works for him"" or something would be cute too. We just need a company  to grow up and do it lol
As an Arab who thought Aladdin had a ton of issues, I’m open to it but Disney isn’t great at doing representation correctly.
Honestly i just want trans princesses and princes. i don't even want disney to do it. just a small animation studio. id love that
I'd love a trans princess, buuutttttt. They'd hace to be careful not to over do it. Disney doesn't have the best track record. If they did this, I would want it to be a princess that also happens to be trans. Show us as normal people, not as some fairy tale creatures.
That would be gay
Trans princess would be awesome, but keep disney out of it.
Monsters Inc.

Mike Wazowski and Celia are actually one person. They each have one eye but together have two. And their take on reality that they're supposed to scare people at night, is actually them experiencing transphobia as their spirit tries to inhabit the body of a child.

Lol....or maybe not lol.
I feel like disney wouldnt do it. Sadly.. but theres always hope. After all disneys only in anything for the $$$. I dont know if its true but i'v always heard they have pride week and merch but only because it sells .. but in overseas box office anything relating to anything about orientation becomes washed and straight laced. :(
It's time for Disney to have a transgender princess.
No. In my opinion Disney doesn't deserve a trans princess fuck that company
YES BUT THEY WILL NEVER DO IT
My cynical side doesn't want it cause of all the fear mongering that will happen. No thanks. Also I've noticed alot of companies will really do a poor job with representation. Personally I'd love a movie created by someone who genuinely wants to make a movie about a trans princess, not feeling pressured to make one and then half ass it and no one ends up liking it.
There's a trans character in Turning Red.
Yeah Disney does barely anything to actually support LGBTQ+ people. They say the right things on social media targeted to western audiences but they don't want to lose too much money by being associated with clearly progressive media to the point of showing actual LGBTQ+ characters on screen.
#WHAT AND HOW
There is quite a bit of LGBTQ+ representation in Horizon. It's so normalized I barely noticed some of it.
Another reason I'm pissed it's not on PC yet.

I hate console exclusives.

Disney has huge political weight,  did jack shit about a bill making it so gender identity/sexuality couldn't be broached in classrooms in context of someone reffering to Thier partner(the gay way) or trans people.  

They also made a huge media save face mess about opposing the bill days before the bill went through anyways.

They've donated to politicians who've supported the bill. 

All while creating products with little flags and adding gay background characters and spurning stupid news stories about Disney's first gay character 6 times a year just to take our money. 

Just make an oc
You mean the don’t say gay bill stuff?
Only they kind of already did, but only to the point that queer folk loved the character but not obvious enough for the straights to be offended..
At least we do have Mulan, with many trans man attributes and challenges.
I got a lesbian vibe from Elsa though in Frozen 2…
Live action or original animated Aladdin?
Technically, you’re not wrong. A trans woman and a cisgender woman would be a lesbian couple.
No shit?
Don't forget they donate to anti-lgbt polititians including the author of the 'don't say gay' bill
And whenever they do have shows with lgbtq+ characters it gets canceled
It’s a side mission but the NPC literally says that the tribe thought [something] when they started wearing a woman’s armor!
Yea! I just discovered the side quest with the Quen to rescue one sister’s wife!
It just came out in February! lol
Yes
They did? What movie is this?
Yea Mulan is relatable in a number of ways, but she isn't trans at the end of the day. If anything it set my kid self back, because if Mulan is a girl, I must be a girl too
Original
Yeah, I know. It took three years for Zero Dawn to come out on PC after the initial PC release. And I loved it.

Now I want to play Forbidden West but I won't cave in to the exclusivity system.
Mulan is a good example. But see this video: https://youtu.be/cMde5YLG6-w"	tvvur8	trans	248	0.92	2022-04-04 07:09:44
Feeling awful and lonely	I’m just so tired of existing like this to be honest. I wish I could go back and just hate being trans. I want to be able to be a girl but no matter what I do I can’t. And because of all the pain.. everyone keeps leaving me. Nobody can handle me and it just feels impossible. I’ve been trying all I can and nothing works. Therapy is taking forever just to get a single session and anti depressants are useless too. I just don’t know what to do at this point. I feel like I’m ruining my life with this. I’ve been so depressed for over a year now and I just want it all to go away. Not even acceptance or clothing or whatever helps so I’m just feeling so damn hopeless. School doesn’t help either. It’s.. awful. I just want to escape but nothing I do works. I’m sorry for venting it just.. hurts.	"Sweetheart I’m so sorry you feel that way! If you need a friend you are very welcome to pm me ❤️
Awh, poor thing! I’m so sorry, if you want you can talk to me. I really hate to see you like this. So please do send me DM, I might be able to help you.
Ketamine is great for treatment resistant depression.  If you can't afford the treatment or you aren't covered by insurance, do some research on proper dosage and treatment schedule. 

It's not hard to find and if you have chemistry training and experience, it's a simple-ish synthesis.

Also, if you aren't on estradiol, get it.  It made my depression and anxiety so much more manageable.  It made my mind quiet, calm and content.  Estradiol valerate is a miracle drug for me.
I understand how you feel, I've been trying to get help for ages now and I feel like everyone has given up on me. Try and focus on one positive thing happening in the future. It could be something a week from now or a year just one positive thing even if its just getting a new game or a new song releasing. It won't 100% help but it'll hopefully give you a reason to keep carrying on and something to get excited about
Same. It's such an emotional mess.  The only time I feel ok is by myself,  in my own world. But I don't want to be alone always. At least you know you're not truly alone. You have a sisterhood here❤❤❤
Pm me if you need to talk and I can get you in my discord or something and Im always.down to talk

Can you be both a trans girl and tomboy?	"I don't like dresses that much and do more like male clothing. But I do fully identify as a girl tho.

**So now my question is: Can you be both a trans girl and tomboy or is it called something else then?**"	"Of fucking course gurl you can be anything you desire💜💜
The answer is yes


Just as trans guys can be femboys


Gender itself is different from presentation
Most of the trans girls I know personally are tomboys 🖤 I'm the only high femme one in our group and it's a bit if a meme at this point

TL;DR - Yes 🖤
Yes
Of course you can! That’s totally my goals to be a tomboy ❤️
If cis women can be tomboy while still being a woman, I don't see why it should be any different for trans woman. The way you decide to express yourself doesn't have anything to do with your gender. 



Just be you, do what makes you happy. You don't have to fit a certain label to be valid. You're amazing in your own way.
Absolutely girllll. I'm generally wearing a tshirt and jeans or leggings but sometimes I like to get all pretty. You don't have to be all dressed up to be who you are, love.
Of course. You’re certainly not the only one. There’s one here too.
Speaking as a transgirl tomboy, hell yes you can. 🖤
Do whatever you want
Yeah of course you can! I'm presenting (and passing sometimes!) at this point and I'm a tomboy
Yes!
You are valid and none less of a girl than those who wear flowery dresses 💜
YES YOU CAN

Join me sister.
Yes, of course.

gender identity =/= gender expression !

Do, what you like!
Idk are cis women who aren’t into dresses and “girly things” not considered women?

Yes you can be a tomboy lol. Being a girl doesn’t mean makeup and pink everything. Personally I wear all black because I’m a discount goth apparently
Yes.
yes you can!!! you can dress how you want!!
gender is a social construct so go ahead
Yes, without a doubt
Yeah you can be any kind of girl you want to be. Just like any other girl. I always have my nails done and wear skirts most of the time. But I also restore cars for a hobby. You can do whatever you want don’t worry about antiquated stereotypes.
Yeah, Girls can be tomboys.
I fully intend to stealth my way to passing, then wear a collared shirt, tie, vest, pants, and coat like it's the 1920's because girls in suits are hot and I intend to be one.

EDIT: So if you want to be a tomboy-goth, don't let your dreams be dreams. Do it. Rock it.
Hell yea
Yeah, that's me. I'm more of a femme tomboy, but I'm definitely a tomboy. 

I'm a mechanic, I'm greasy, I'm crass, I chug beer like a freakin' champ, I don't own makeup. I do love dresses and heels though even if I'm usually in jeans.
Hell yeeeee.

And I imagine you both look and feel great if you were. 

I'm NB and although I'm andro sometimes I'm also incredibly masc, like, most days you wouldn't know to look at that I'm NB, but I don't feel like I got into anything else as comfortably as that identity. 

It is what it is, and I am what I am.
Yes. Be you.🙋‍♀️✌🏳️‍⚧️
Absolutely! My best friend is a trans girl, and her whole vibe is pretty much lesbian tomboy, and she rocks it. I myself am trans masc but I align more towards the femboy aesthetic. Clothes and presentation are just one of the many facets of who you are, and there's nothing wrong with not being a super girly girl just because you're trans. You get to define what your femininity means to you. :)
r/masctranswomen
Yes if you want to you can.
Gotmick is a femboy, you can absolutely be a tomgirl <3
Thanks for sharing everyone! I was wondering about this too a little - love everyone’s input!
hell yeah!! i’m still closeted but i’m definitely a tomboy. yesterday me and my dad were working on our motorcycles and then went on a nice ride and i felt really at home as a tomboy/masculine girl. having “traditionally masculine” hobbies, interests, or styles doesn’t take away from your womanhood or mine!!
Yes.
Yes. It's called being yourself.
Trans women can express themselves in just as many ways as cis women can. If cis girls can be tomboys, then trans girls can too :)
I don't see the problem. Some girls are masculine, some guys are feminine. Trans people are not an acception.
Can a CIS AFAB be a tomboy? What makes you any different? lol

You can enjoy, act, dress, however and whatever way you want and still be a girl, being trans doesn't make that any different besides the internalized stuff from societal pressure many of us feel of not being <blank> enough if we don't act or dress a certain way. 

Just be you, you're still a girl!
Kinda strange cuz whenever I have these thoughts I’m like “mAyBe Am NoT gOrL” but if someone asked me this my first thought is “hell yea you can and fuck anyone who says otherwise”
Yeah

Hobbies + Clothes =/= Gender
No expression of yourself will invalidate your identity!

I don’t think I’m going to transition after all	"Basically, the amount of gatekeeping, the hoops you have to jump through to even be able to access HRT, along with the social stigma that comes with being trans (I'm sorry, but it's real even though I wish it wasn't) and generally just feeling tired of trying are making me have second thoughts about transitioning.

I came out to (most of my closest) friends, went to a therapist (who was terrible), have been trying fem clothes at home and loving it, imagined my future as a woman and got all warm and fuzzy. I look at /r/transtimelines and wish that was me. I walk down the street and get jealous of every woman I see. It makes me happy to have someone use my chosen name and I cringe at being called **a man**. I dream of waking up as a woman, or starting my life over, but as a girl...

But still, somehow I suddenly don't feel this feeling of urgency to transition anymore. I've been thinking about going back to the gym, regrowing my beard and forgetting about all of this. Maybe it was just a fantasy after all. One that I've had since I was young, but still. My dysphoria went from ""I can't even look at myself in the mirror without being nauseous"" to ""meh, I guess I'd prefer having a female body, but this is fine I guess"" within the past few days and I'm scared that it will completely disappear soon.

What's wrong with me? Why can't I just be certain that I am trans (or cis, even that would be fine I guess)?"	"Contrary to some gatekeepers in our own community, you don't have to hate your body to have a case of the genders. If you experience consistent euphoria from usage of your chosen name/pronouns, that's pretty solid evidence that the feeling is here to stay. It's also so dangerous to be trans right now, you very well could be preferring being in the closet over being visible as yourself. I don't know you, but being okay with your body doesn't mean your trans card gets revoked, especially when there are other signs that DO line up with the trans experience. You could even have a more fluid/ambiguous relationship with gender. No matter what it turns out to be, you are valid.
You have to do what is right for you. Walk this road at a pace that keeps you safe. If you need a rest, take a rest, if you need to stop then stop. You are loved, valid and respected for who you are.
Actually a lot of trans people have doubts like this. It's scary being trans, especially if you don't have a support structure. Transitioning would make you the enemy of many transphobic people. Some people get more focused on the fear of persecution than the joy of being true to themselves. It's scary standing up for who you are but ultimately worthwhile.
Body modification doesn’t define transition and it makes a lot of sense to fear being visibly trans or visibly gender non conforming, especially when that can draw attention or violence. Finding comfort in my own body as it is after stopping T for health reasons has been good for me - accepting all features even if they haven’t been my target gender presentation. Your feelings of euphoria and also uncertainty are valid. It’s also okay to find acceptance as you are. I feel like a lot of trans folks feel the need to polarize in the binary of masc or femme and then many of us end up more in the middle. 

For whatever it’s worth, I don’t think there’s something wrong with you! There is so much unpacking of gender narratives that can get in the way of finding our selves and who we’d be without that propaganda.
trans doesn't mean transition
You can be trans without HRT.
As others have said, you don't need to have dysphoria/hate your body to be trans, getting gender-euphoria from living/imagining yourself as the other gender is also solid evidence of being trans, without the need for dysphoria. Being trans also doesn't mean transitioning, be it medically, socially or in some other way.

Now, if you do want to transition medically and have at least some money to spare, you can also do diy. I'd recommend checking our r/transdiy, although, if you do diy you might not be eligible for other things such as name or birth-sex-marker-change based on your local laws or surgerys, so keep that in mind.
You'll be back.

This shit never goes away.

And you'll wish you'd acted on it when you were younger.
No one can tell you whether you are trans or not. That's something you'll have to figure out. There is nothing wrong with taking your time to figure things out. Your experience is valid.
Agreed 100 % agreed. I hate my body, I hate my mind, I hate myself. I would do anything to feel like a human.
There’s nothing wrong with you, this is ultimately your decision, and your hesitation, for whatever reason is valid. However, if your looking for a long term commitment, going back to the gym, regrow out your beard, it implies past attempts, I fear you will circle back to this even under the best circumstances. Maybe set it aside for now, but should you come back to it, then your going to have to own it that time around. And owning it doesn’t mean full transition, it doesn’t have to mean any real change at all, it’s just you no longer in doubt which I found really helped me, and whatever challenges that are out there can be handled at your own time and pace, and and if it falls into why bother? why care? Because you matter, and your happiness matters, your worthy of your efforts. 😅 but yes, it’s your choice, and no it’s certainly not easy, but just from my personal experience who lost quite a bit and has struggled a bunch, I’d rather suffer honestly then needlessly 🤷🏻‍♀️ if that makes any sense.
I am going through the exact same thing. What seemed so natural for me to do, suddenly seems to be, like ""why bother? I can't be what is in my mind, anyway."" But I'm not giving up just yet. I'm going to a trans support meeting tonight in order to meet some real people and hear what they have to say. I'm all over the map right now and feel miserable because of it. I need to get to the bottom of this. Then there will be a follow up with my psychologist (who is very supportive). Either way, I too have experienced a sudden change in my thinking. Maybe it's a common thing when you get too close to having actual appointment with an endocrinologist. Reality is smacking me upside the head...
Doesnt sound like your cis but only you know you. The journey is long and arduous but with the trials and tribulations youbwill face you might gain something you have longed for a long time. Life is about choices.
you don't need to have dysphoria to be trans, and you don't have to transition to be trans
Aw first off *hugs* 

Doubting yourself or having trepidation to transition is normal. Or, I would think it would be. ❤️ Look, like you said, the hoops we have to jump through, the social stigma, and the physical and financial toll of it all can make transitioning a very daunting endeavor. Just know this: this is YOUR transition. This is your life. You don't have to do things all at once or right away, or by following some script. If you don't feel transitioning is the best option for you rn due to all the above reasons, then don't. You're still trans, your feelings are still valid. Know that we all love and support you. 

And if years down the road you revisit this and transition, don't feel regret because you are doing things on YOUR time. ❤️ 
I wish you best of luck :))
A lot of what you are worried about has a great deal to do with where you live. It’s why I moved before transitioning. More accepting people and medical systems makes a huge difference.
There's an app called spruce, with the app you can get in contact with Plume. They are a really awesome group that can get you on hrt pretty quick.

Just in case you want to consider it
As somebody who came to the same conclusion years ago for allot of the same reasons I say you shouldn't give up on transitioning so easily (not trying to imply you came to this conclusion lightly).

I tried and for roughly seven to eight years I was the most miserable I had ever been, was even suicidal. 
now I'm in the middle of my transition and i regret not doing it sooner.

its not easy to transition. it definitely comes with it's own problems. above all the hoops you mentioned you will be comparing yourself constantly to other women, especially other trans women. there are still days where you will doubt yourself, and theres the chance your dysphoria will never truly go away; but it also doesn't go away by just deciding not to go through with it. it seems easier on the surface to not transition and not worry about it, but the reality is if these feelings persist as you described them then you will  most likely continue to feel them, no amount of trying to just move on will help, infact I'd argue it has the potential to lead to real harm.

ultimately, choose what you think is right for you, and if this is what you think that is then I wish you the best.
just wanted to share that, cuz I know first hand what it's life to try and suppress my dysphoria and looking back that was way harder than transitioning.
Last paragraph describes me to a T. 

Have months and months where I just wanna be a girl. Then ill have a month or so feeling hyper masc and hating myself
I hate the ‘consistent, insistent and persistent’ language that’s still often used as a gate keeping talking point for young trans people. Your journey can have all the twists and turns in the world and you are valid and you are trans. Unless you feel one day that you don’t identify with that term, then you’re not trans- see it’s up to you and you don’t need to feel invalidated when you encounter the curves in the road. Easier said than done though, when society wants us to ‘know we were born in the wrong body since the day we were born’ in order to make transness easier for the world to wrap its head around.

Oh- also I feel like many trans people who may have experimented with gender and presentation in an erotic context before coming to see themselves as trans question their own validity when they look back at those early gender experiments, thinking that it’s evidence that their gender feelings are play/fetish etc and not Real. But play and eroticism and all that are ways that we sometimes open ourselves up more to our brains and our hearts and maybe aren’t evidence that it’s all fantasy but actually point to something deep and real.

But only you can know. And maybe not even you right away.. be patient with yourself and as loving as you can manage.
Labels are no big deal. I don't fit into any category. My body changed for the better and I love how I feel now. I'm still in male mode never changed my outward appearance. Told no one. I don't need to socially transition to feel female. I get the best of both worlds and love it. Yes, my wife did see my body changes as time went by, and she's fine with it, that's great too! What you do is your business is totally up to you. There's no right or wrong. female boy shorts and tank tops feel great while still looking male. Shower time is fantastic. My skin is soft and feels great. I'm really both sides at once. How great is that!
To tack on...

I am ""okay"" with my body... but I am happy with the parts that HRT has change, or has been surgically changed.

Being Okay, and being Happy are not the same thing. Being Okay with is super fucking important for your mental health, and what you saying that you are becoming okay with your body, means that just even beginning this path has likely had some positive effects on your mental wellbeing.

Ultimately, OP, which you do is up to you. Try not to make a choice out of fear though. Reason through your feelings, applying logic when reason seems conflicted. Way the risks, the safety factor...

A lot of us fight through the gatekeeping because the end goal is worth the fight, even if there should not be a fight.

A big point though is being okay with your body does not mean you don't have dysphoria. Dysphoria is also not required to be trans, nor does it need to be constant and unrelenting.
Yeah gonna second this. I came out last year and still haven’t started hrt because I think I look good! I honestly don’t hate my body at all. I fit into all the clothes I like and the shoes I want to wear. That’s enough, at least for now. 

When I came out I didn’t have any sense of urgency, I did it because I got sober and everyone said if I kept secrets locked away I’d relapse so I said fuck it and just came out. Best decision I’ve ever made by a long shot.
unless ( like Buck Angel, Debbie Hayton, Qunicty Bell or Sinead watson ) you shit on the doorstep on the way out  there will be a seat at the table when  / if you return
I agree completely with this. Not only are my family conservative, but I also live in a very conservative area that is extremely rural. I mean the kind of area with a gun club in every town
This.

Literally every trans person ever has wished that they'd transitioned sooner.
Literally me. Egg first cracked at 17, got terrified when I realized what being trans might mean for me (RE: violence, hatred, etc), jumped back in the closet for 11 years. Here I am again.
Yup, unfortunately that’s the truth right there.
Not OP but wow your words are so powerful and are so so true. When the going gets tough...

""why bother? why care? Because you matter, and your happiness matters, your worthy of your efforts"".

""I’d rather suffer honestly then needlessly""
Yup, that's how I view it you just put it words perfectly :))
Thankfully I don't know who they are but I suppose the seat left open at the table.
Thank you, I’m trying to get out there more and help support others while also working on my own self esteem by expressing myself more, glad it has resonance."	upmd2o	trans	238	0.96	2022-05-14 17:42:38
First girl clothes arrived today wish I was ready to go out in public like this.		"honey you look flawlesssss
Off to a good start!
Aha! I see you too have the uniform 💜
This is super cute!! That skirt combo would look amazing with some sort of white shirt and jean jacket!! :)
You are beautiful omg 💕💕
How tall are you? Looking good btw
Just out of curiosity, why aren't you going out in public like that?
Thanks I’ll keep those in mind next time I’m clothes shopping
6’2” ish far too tall
This was a few months ago I’ve gotten a lot more comfortable with my self and regularly do so now. Went out in a dress for the first time today even if it was mostly covered with my coat because of the rain. Can’t wait for warmer weather now.
I think 6'2"" is a good height :)
Good, just checking. You are easily good enough to be out and about! Keep it up.
Thanks 💜
Thank you. Xx"	ihkdiu	trans	240	0.98	2020-08-27 12:45:41
Step son came out as transgender and his father is deployed.	"My husband is currently deployed and his son (12M) came out to me that he is transgender. I’m transgender myself and he is aware. Since my husband has been gone for 2 months out of his 12 month deployment. He has been asking me a lot of questions. Which I’m more the happy to answer and listen. However when we were at Target. I found him in the girls section. After talking about his feelings I could tell he really wanted some of the things. I ended up getting him a few female clothing items. We have talked about pronouns. He wish’s to identify as She/Her. So when she is at home she does were dresses and so on. 

I have not told me husband about this yet. I know I’m overstepping but I feel this will allow her to feel safe to understand the way she is feeling. I know the feeling she is having now and I wished I had this support when I was her age. 

To note. My husband and I have been together for 5 years and his previous wife passed away from cancer."	"Coming out is a very difficult time and can be incredibly scary. I know it may be hard to not talk to your partner about this right away, but it’s best to wait until your daughter feels ready. It’s amazing she already has the relationship with you to be able to share who she really is, and I wish more parents like yourself would be so accepting! 

You can always, in regular conversation, ask if she would like help coming out, and discussing with her father (your husband). I think it will mean a lot knowing you’ve got her back, and for her to know to be proud of who she is!
That's a tough situation for a step mom.

* it's really cool that your step daughter felt safe to come out to you.

* you're being supportive & that's great. 

* it's not your place to out her to your husband 

* it's not your place to keep things from your husband,  particularly regarding his child.

IMO the sooner she's able to come out to her dad,  the better off you'll all be.
I personally would try to feel out why she doesn't want to come out to her father.  If it's a fear of rejection, you can probably attempt to relieve that with the evidence of him being married to you.  If it's a desire to tell him in person, you might have to explain how long he's going to be gone, and how it's q much better idea to tell him now.  If it's just cause she's still trying things on, I personally see nothing wrong with letting her feel it out for a bit.  I fell like finding a therapist will help her work through her feelings, and give you someone to discuss this with.
It's so awesome that she trusts you enough to be open about exploring her identity, and that you're supporting her!

Coming from someone whose parent outed them to their other parent as a teenager: Do not tell her parent without her permission.

1. It is always the individual's choice when and how to come out, regardless of your relationship. (Imagine a child coming out to a teacher they trust at school, and that teacher outing them to their parents without consent. How would that feel to the student?) 
2. Outing her without permission will break her trust, especially after sharing such a vulnerable piece of herself with you.

It's really beautiful that you're able to provide a space where she feels safe enough to get to know herself. Perhaps her dad may wish he had known sooner. It is also easy for me to imagine her dad being proud of the relationship you share with his daughter.
If you are trans yourself why did you misgender her for the first half of the post? 
But I think it's great you're supporting her in her journey to understand herself better, and I also think the decision to tell her dad should be hers to make, so good on keeping that secret for now!
Have you thought about talking to her about coming out to her dad yet. At the same time explain to her that you not telling her dad puts you in a very bad situation with him. Since he’s in the military, he should have internet connection on base, that way the 3 of you can FaceTime time together and have a chat.
If your spouse knows you're trans, it should be fine

Only advice I can give is to not wait untill he's back from deployment

Sudden surprises don't go well imo
You doing amazing job at parenting your step daughter (sorry if I used the wrong pronoun) is lucky to have you
Maybe I’m not understanding it right, but wouldn’t it be better if you tell your husband (in private of course)?

I mean, that way when your stepdaughter comes out, she has an easier time because her dad already kinda knows already (of course, tell him to not to say any word about it)…

Sorry if I’m making a mistake about something.
She has asked me to wait for the time being and I’m going to respect her wises. I love the trust that we have created in only the short time I’ve lived in the US. Even though I have know her for 5 years that was mostly via FaceTime. I just worry the longer I wait to say something to me husband the deeper the hole will become. 

I support her 100% but as her step mom. I feel that I’m in the middle. Because at her age I wish I had that support but on the other end I I owe it to my husband to let him know what is going on during his time away.
Am I just enabling her by allowing her to be herself at home and me buying her things that she identifies with but not tell her father. 

Just this weekend she redid her whole room as we just moved. It’s a much more feminine room now. She loves it but this is where I feel that I’m enabling her.
Her answer changes on why she does not want to tell her dad. After getting different answers I did not want to push it more because I want her to know I’m listening to her then questioning her. 

I just find a therapist myself since moving here. Going to a therapist is new to me as we because that is something not needed in the Philippines but if that is the right step for her I think it would be a good idea. 

I just don’t want to add more secrets from her dad.
I did that for conscience to understand the situation. I did not want people to get confused if she was MTF or FtM. Sorry if I did not do that well. 

Thank you as well with you support. All I want to do is be supportive to be daughter and my husband.
He does have internet. Not the best at all time. I’m new to this military stuff. He cannot call all the time. Another reason I worry about her telling her dad over the phone and he can’t find is bad. It’s just very frustrating on how he has to be away and we just moved and I’m in a new country.
I understand the duality but what in your mind takes priority, supporting your child or talking to your husband?

Honestly, regardless of your husbands support or not I hope you would still support your child. It doesn’t matter that your a step parent they’re yours now and they’re trusting you to look out for their best interest.
Huge hugs on coming forward to discuss your thoughts listen and educate yourself on what your child is going through.  When a child knows something like this early its both terrifying but also very good for them.  Transitioning early can lead to a much healthier mind set and remove many of the hurdles transgender people face. 

I would give your child some time to think things over and forwardly support them best you can and get them an open consoler if needed (who will support what your child wants and needs).  

But I also would not put off telling your husband too long something in the 3-6 month range is probably a reasonable amount of time to wait (but many people could argue different times for different reasons).  That gives your child enough time to let this revaluation sink in of having an ally, and friend who knows.  But also doesn't put off you husband any more than needed.  I would nudge your child once a month of ""Are you ok with us talking to dad about this"".  That way they're part of the conversation and ready when they need to be.
You’re not overstepping.

You know the pain of being outed, you owe your stepchild to protect her. Your husband should understand this, and from your experience it seems like he is understanding and well versed on queer issues.

Protect your daughter.
Supporting vs enabling... that can be tough call. I'd argue that you're supporting her, in terms of her gender expression.

IMO she needs to establish a timeline for coming out to her father. Delaying this for too long withdrew become enabling.  Between now and then, I think you should keep notes or a journal.
I hope I didn't come off to harsh about that... I get what you mean, for me I prefer always using the correct pronouns, I actually became a bit confused and thought this post was about a trans-masc who still likes girl-things until you talked about her preferred pronouns, and I think for people who are unsure when you say, that your daughter told you she identifies as a girl, or that she prefers she/her pronouns, at least at this point they should know what you're talking about... and other than that, when you talk about a trans person who is your daughter it should be clear what you mean (at least to people of this sub) but that's just my opinion :)  


And it's amazing that she has such a supportive step-mom who can help her and understand her experience, for me it's always helpful to talk to other trans ppl, especially irl. I srsly wish I had parents like you...
Could have said amab or afab
Yes my heart and my mind is says that I will support my daughter as that is the right thing she needs. I can’t see why my husband would not support her because I’m transgender as well. I understand that is not easy for a parent but as you said it’s what is in the best interest. 

I worry to tell him over the phone since he is away and will not be back for another 10 months. I just don’t want to keep secrets from each other.
Good idea on keeping a journal. I have been thinking of a timeline myself for her to include me as a step mom since I have been through this myself. However I’m from the Philippines and I just moved to the US this year. I myself is still learning how the things work in the US. 

Example for me to get hormones. I learn I just can’t go to the store and get hormones as I would in the Philippines.
🥰
Oh sorry I don’t know what that means.
So you’ve decided to support her transition, now you need to figure out how to talk to your husband, and you pretty much have two options, wait ten months or text him and tells him now.

Personally, I would vote for the second option as that gives him months to process things before he will interact with her, plus I assume he has internet access and can look up stuff that he might want to know. He will probably come to you for advice too but I think overall he would appreciate being let know sooner than later. But finally, I would ask permission from your daughter before telling him.
Assigned male at birth or assigned female at birth. And don't worry I didn't know this for a way too long period of time
Great advice. 100% I support her and now it’s understanding what is the best way to do that."	q1xd9f	trans	235	0.97	2021-10-05 14:20:30
Helped a trans boy at my work.	"I had one of the most fortunate meetings of my job thus far.   
I work at a clothing store that sells suits and other clothing items tailored for men. After being there for a long long time, over the years I have had many encounters with all sorts of people. I've helped people who are big, who are really small, some who have disabilities, many females who like men's attire and just a few trans men.   
Well this past week a clearly nervous young fellow walked into my store, nervous beyond all reason, asking to be fitted up in a suit for - (I don't remember now what event he was going to and to be honest it has little baring on the whole story). I go ""Sure thing my m-""   
He cuts me off and just spills out emotion and explanation. He says "" Hi!-I'm-transgender-and -his-is-my-first-time-buying-a-suit-please-help-me"". It came out of nowhere! I probably would have been able to guess based on a pure measurements that this young man would need a little bit extra help when it came to fit, but I doubt I would have just ***KNOWN*** that he was trans. Before I even had time to think he was apologizing, talking about how he had cried in the car and how he wished his dad was there. From our interaction I think the dad is supportive, just busy at the time.  
Let me tell you, I have never had such a urge to shelter and nurture someone in my life other than my own actual child. The young man asked that we keep our total under 300 and damn it I was determined to meet that goal. We went over everything to be fitted to the nines, with him no joke apologizing and thanking me every few minutes. I did my best to let him know it was all going to be okay.  
In the end we had a suit, a few shirts and ties, some tailoring and a pair of shoes with a matching belt. our total was 370... I was shocked I had thought I did the math right but I clearly had not. I decided to pay for the shoes and the belt myself (my manager actually split it with me once I told her that I was going to cover the belt/shoes). When we went over the total he was super happy and we both had a bit of a moment after I told him we covered the two extra items. We hugged (I know that's taboo with covid, but it felt right) and parted ways.   
The reason im typing this all out is a few things, Im so incredibly stunned/proud/happy of everyone who has the courage to be their true self. My job and where I live make it super hard for me to be open about anything much less something that my community would describe as a sin worthy lifestyle. The second thing is there are allies and closeted folk everywhere even in crappy Blue Lives Matter mecca's, I mean still be cautious but just know were out there. I would more than welcome any trans person who needs help, in fact its probably the most rewarding thing to do at my job. Helping people feel like themselves is totally not selfless and Im okay with that, But seeing that man feel appreciated and happy and handsome was the best thing ever.  
Anyway thanks for reading this little tale."	"That’s so beautiful, thank you  <3.
As a transmasc guy who fully expects to be in that situation someday, thank you for being so amazing. You're exactly the kind of person that guy was looking for, and I'm sure he enjoyed and appreciated it more than you can imagine.
You're doing the proverbial lord's work, keep it up.  💜
This was a really beautiful story. Thank you for sharing!
That's awesome! 😁👍
I love stories like this, and I absolutely love people like you! The world needs more of this kind of people. Thank you for doing this 🏳️‍🌈
That's a great story, I'm glad you shared that with us and I'm glad there's people like you out there ❤️
You're a beautiful person. Such humility.
Thanks. It was a touching moment to me!
There’s something special about coming across other trans people in the wild, I’ll admit I’m still riding the high of seeing another trans guy at the farmers market. You’re honestly an angel for helping him out like that, I hope you have a wonderful day :)"	n6nnsj	trans	235	1.0	2021-05-07 01:58:45
I wore a dress for the first time today!	One of my friends gave me his old dresses and is going to teach me how it sew so I can alter them to fit me better. I’m not gonna wear it in public yet, but first feminine clothing article off the checklist for me! Also, it is really freeing in terms of how it feels while wearing it.	"Yea!!! Get it girl!! I haven't crossed that bridge myself but can't wait to do so hehe 🙃
They feel so good! I can't wait until I'm out publicly so I can just wear them all the time!
I bet you look really great in a dress!
OMG!! That’s so awesome!! I tried on and bought my first really nice dress the other day and had an incredibly cathartic and emotional reaction, made me cry seeing myself so simply beautiful :,) 

I hadn’t felt that level of gender euphoria since the first time I tried on my Halloween costume from last Halloween which cracked my egg :)
Me too actually. I'm getting fitting done so I have something to put in a modeling application.
Boo why would you do that
Thanks! I was worried about how they would fit, if they would look fine, but the only issue was my arms.
They do feel great! I thought people were exaggerating when they said it felt freeing, but they were spot on. I just need to make sure everything fits properly and it’s as comfortable as I can get it before I wear it in public. My school has already changed my name in the system and all of my teachers and friends call me it. I feel incredibly lucky with how everything went down.
I do, but the holes where the arms go are too tight and short. I’m planning on using it at home only for now, but it feels great.
Edit: just remembered they are called sleeves. I’m a dumbass sometimes lol
It’s amazing. Gender dysphoria isn’t super bad for me,  but it kind of felt weird to look at myself again after wearing it. I’m really excited too because depending on what happens I might be able to actually wear it to school within the next couple of months.
Why not?
Yea I'm 40 6ft and wide shoulders not looking forward to fitting myself but it'll be worth it haha
Wearing affirming clothing to school is my last step actually before I’m 100% out. Out in public, among my family, extended fam, all friends, now I just have to conquer the fear of what my college peers will think. 

I might be in the same boat as you with the time frame. I plan to transfer to a new college next fall where I’ll feel comfortable enough to present the way I want to without fear of judgement. There, I plan to present fem from the beginning :)
I just gained quite a bit of weight over quarantine and didn’t work out. I’m only 16 but I’m starting to work out again and I have awesome friends who are helping me whenever I need it. I hope you find stuff!
I’m already out to my family, friends and school, but I’m just taking things slow with clothes and stuff. I’m lucky I have friends who are teaching me about makeup, nails, and clothes. My mom is struggling with it. She is supportive, but thinks I might be genderfluid instead of trans. She is being weird about it all.
🙂🙂🙂 thank you me too!
Sounds like my mom too tbh. She wants to be supportive, and she’s not bothered by my looks, outfits, or all my new friends. Yet she still misgenders and deadnames me, so it just leads me to believe that she feels somewhat confused about the whole thing.
My mom is definitely confused about it all. I pretty much am only able to talk to my dad about it. I’m just happy that I have supportive parents. My friends didn’t get so lucky sadly."	soqzk1	trans	232	0.98	2022-02-09 23:18:57
why are some parents homophobic/Transphobic	They be like I'll always love and support you but then when you come out they no longer want anything to do with you they won't allow you to buy your own clothes with your money cause you live under their house. Just doesn't make any sense to me	"Parents have expectations for their children before they are even born.

They fantasize about the life they want you to have, and transgender usually isn't on the list.

They don't know how to emotionally come to terms and cope with the fact their child has told them they are transgender.

Let their feelings be theirs, they may or may not ever come around, but sometimes time and space help.
There’s no hate like Christian love
A lot, maybe even most, people that become parents do it for misguided reasons, at points before they've developed the emotional maturity to cope with it. It's one of the gulfs between natural human behaviour and the requirements of living in a complex society. The correlation between education and birthrates is not a coincidence. Learning critical reasoning skills helps overcome natural patterns of behaviour and social expectations that are detrimental.

The fact that we ever pulled ourselves out of the mud and managed to build something for people that weren't just ourselves, and that we keep doing that, is one of the best reasons to have hope for humanity as a whole. So, it's not all bad. I'm standing on the shoulders of giants, and I hope I can be someone's giant in the future, too.
religion, usually.

my sympathies.

look into the trevorproject.org for some help.
Because parents are people, and there's a lot of shit people out there. Having kids doesn't suddenly make a shit person into a good person. Just means they banged without a condom.
Lack of knowledge. And in some cases I'm guessing preconceived notions of just what ""trans"" is. My father thought that I was a drag queen at first. Eh, no.

No religion involved in my family (Swedes) but was met with just lack of interest. Lack of wanting to know. It felt like ""no, we don't talk about this so maybe it just goes away"".

And, I guess that I at the time as also stopped pretending and adapting to my father (and later brother). I showed the true me, and that was apparently ""wrong"".

Trans AND an artist. Nononono. Not a big hit in a family with people that can do math and stuff. I can't do math to save my life.

But I was 42 years old the time, so they (him) could just FO to the darkest place possible. My own place since years. Didn't rely on them for anything. So, byyyyye bitch.
Same ppl are usually horrible sexist too in my experience cause they care so much about traditional gender roles. Sometimes it’s rooted in their own insecurities. But often it’s just because ppl are scared and afraid of things they don’t understand or that are different from what they’re use to seeing.
IDK but even if they are homophobic/transphobic I just couldnt imagine kicking your child out. They must truly believe that lgbt really are groomers or whatever narrative is being pushed to make lgbt people look evil.
They grew up in an era when ""supposed to's"" and ""supposed NOT to's"" ruled their world, when everything was Right or Wrong, and all was Black and White with no shades of gray.

NOW what? What will THEIR siblings and family think of THEM?  (Not you, THEM)?  What about their co-workers, their church peers, their neighbors? They believe it's more right to play to their beliefs than to support a ""misguided child""...
Religion has certainly a huge role in this...
Bc some people aren’t meant to be parents but forgot to use a condom
My mom was totally fine w my friend (mtf) transitioning. My friendis a lesbian and my mother accepts that bc well, she likd women befor so of courseshe still does. 

Not so much w me (ftm) transitioning. And she thinks I'm now primarily attracted to women... I'm bi, primarily male attracted, she knows this. 🤦‍♂️
People like the idea of unconditional love, but often aren't prepared for the reality of unconditional love. Depressingly, almost all love is conditional.
My family is not the religious op but are afraid to lose the 28 years they invested in me and of people gossip,  they told me to move out so I did and then they tracked me down and stole one of my phones and passport and threatened to beat me or kill me if I don't come *home* with them and to de transition and be a man , so I did but I think I will resume hrt in secret because if I didn't I will properly kill myself 🥲
I'm a 28 years old by the way 😭
Because they are humans and humans are sometimes dumb and stuck in their ways. That is sad but true for so many things not just homophobia.
Some reasons for that is their public image, and their reputation. Ive been trying to research it for a while now, havent come up with anything new
This is literally my parents. I've learned this the hard way. This is especially true for my mom who's gotten to the point of living vicariously through me and honestly it got to the point where she almost treated me like a doll. She loved buying me clothes, getting my hair cut a very specific way, and would always go after me for not clipping my nails or taking care of my skin.

&#x200B;

My transition has broken her to the point where she's >!contemplated suicide!< and is struggling in therapy right now. She told me she doesn't even want to shop for Christmas anymore and my little brother told me its because she is depressed about what to do about buying me clothes, as my mom usually looks forward to getting me clothes for Christmas every year and this year she has no idea what to do because she is not ok with getting me girl clothes but she knows I will reject any and all boy clothes. She apparently has recurring nightmares about me being a girl and she told me she's terrified to see what I look like now.

I don't know how to help her. I'm going to see her in less than a month and I am *not* going to boymode just to make her comfortable (my parents made it clear they will not respect my name and pronouns - so if they think I'm making them uncomfortable to spite them they should think about what they are doing). They also said they are embarrassed to even be seen with me in public (I actually pass decently at this point). Maybe my trip home will put their fears to rest, maybe it will make things worse. Only one way to find out.
Most eloquently stated! 😍
I'll agree,most of this is true. I had an insane desire for my child to be happy and have a full and wonderful life. I was thrown a curveball 2 decades in when my child,amab,said I'm a woman. When she told me,years before, I think I'm gay,no problem. Some worries about bad climate but,no real worries. When she said I'm actually a trans female my heart dropped immediately. Not because I didn't still live and want her to be happy but I was absolutely terrified for her. Parents want to protect and shield and suddenly I knew I was powerless to do that. We talked endlessly about all the potential ramifications for her future, with a therapist a lot of the time. I'm now elated to say she's elated with her life and I love her just the same as before. She makes me smile everytime I see her feeling right and great with herself. I often still feel scared that some awful people might clock her and decide to act on hate for whatever reason those ppl carry that. But mostly I got past that and just see the day to day happy she has. I'm not even sure why I wanted to say all this because I know damn well sometimes parents just can't accept what is. But also sometimes they can't accept because fear for your child is so great, it blocks the rest that wants to just love and support. It's a mixed bag. I wholly love and support my fully well adjusted, happily married and in SUCH a healthy place daughter. But. Trans kids facing talking to your parents, address their fears during the talk. Maybe they know they're being in accepting because they fear for you and what you're facing. Maybe it's not that at all but of you don't talk about it you'll never know. If it's something else entirely (religion societal constraints or just ignorance) I'm sorry and I wish I could hug you because you deserve love and affirmation but you owe it to yourself to find out for certain where your parents stand because they may just need a little guidance too. I hope my thoughts are not mistaken,they're from the heart of a fully aware of the world but supportive  parent that wants to believe all parents will love but has seen the not so great parents too 💜
Yes, they have every right to have their feelings. No, they don’t have any right to use their emotions to restrict or even hurt others especially their children

Don’t have children if you can’t let them live their life instead of yours. And definitely don’t have children if you believe they’re your property
This is such an awesome comment... thanks for sharing this. I really needed to read it. :)
I'm not Christian but I'm pretty sure the Bible said to love everyone or sum like that
you often find nonreligious people with anti-lgbtq sentiments. religion is so malleable you can use it to say almost anything. people just tend to want someone on the bottom, and they pick whatever minority or outsider they can find often. sometimes, even the majority (women, african americans in the south).
This is helpful for me understanding my parents right now. Thank you.
hello I'm in the same situation but way younger how can I try explain my parents that being trans isn't being a drag queen?? thanks alreadu
and what will they think of themselves… looking back on their own pain of NOT being true to themselves because the “supposed to’s” and “supposed not to’s” overcame them years ago. They’ve gone all-in on their beliefs and “learned to live half a life,” so it is extra painful for them to see you live a full one, seemingly heedless of the self-suppression they suffered to birth you and commit their future to straight inside-the-box parenthood. A child of immigrants came out to her mother as lesbian… her mother (a Muslim) cried, “you think I didn’t like girls too?! It doesn’t mean you get to marry one!”
But why I thought God is supposed to love everyone so why are Christians specifically after us
report your passport stolen, get a new one. Move again so they won't find you, resume HRT and cut those abusive people out of *your* life.

It's your life, do whatever you want with it. Also you really need to get away from them. you're 28, you don't need to live under their roof anymore. You're an adult.
I know its not my business but can you keep me posted on this im genuinely curious
Concerns about your child’s wellbeing and the dangers if them being openly trans are very fair

It’s got to be scary as a parent to hear that your baby is putting a target on their back just for being who they are
which part of the bible, exactly? because there are plenty of shitty parts of the bible, and shitty religious people.
Wasn't the bible first written with the express purpose of manipulating citizens?
If you say so, I didn't exactly say anything that's all that much of a revelation. Unless you're being sarcastic. But we're name twins so that's neat.
They're a weird lot, with a ton of contradictions.
If you want to know more about it please read the post in my profile
Sure. IDK what's going to happen. My dad and I face timed me and he said it was painful for him to see me with long hair and makeup. He openly told me he wished I would be a strong man...
John 15:12-13. “My command is this: Love each other as I have loved you. Greater love has no one than this: to lay down one's life for one's friends.” atleast I think so  there's like 30 verses saying stuff close to this
I can't. It's marked as NSFW and I'm not turning that off because last time I did that was a horrible mistake
Well his wishes arent your own. Hopefully he realizes this mind if i send a dm?
you can quote me all the bible i want, but when there are christian religious leaders and politicians calling for the death of trans people, and celebrating the Club Q shooting, all the bible verses mean absolutely nothing.
Go ahead with the DM.

&#x200B;

I do feel bad though. My dad basically said he's dedicated his whole life to me and I'm taking it all for granted (we didn't speak for a couple months because of some huge fights we've had over my transition and he still hasn't forgiven me)
Yes I agree but you asked what part of the Bible to I told you
This. All I see that Christianity serves to do is give lunatics that don’t understand half of what the Bible’s saying a “reason” to try to erase us.
Yes, I agree. Many are recklessly responsible for the spewed hatred and they attribute to their misguided faith. It’s a terrible and tramatizing abuse. But there are also welcoming and affirming churches too. Just have to avoid the others.
You asked for the reference. OP gave you the reference.
I’m sorry you’re family has been soooo absolutely awful to you about everything I hope they come around someday. Also you’re father has absolutely nothing to forgive you for if anything he should be apologizing to you and both of your parents should be absolutely ashamed of themselves and how awfully they’ve treated you. 

I’m working on coming out to my mom and this is my absolute worst case scenario, I still have no idea what I’ll do if it goes that way, I doubt I could handle it as well as you have. ❤️❤️❤️
Thanks. I’m trying to be the bigger person, accept the blame, and put up with them misgendering me. They need me in their life just to function. It’s not fair of me to just cut them off like that even if they hurt me.
I’m sorry they make you feel that way, people who allegedly need you shouldn’t hurt you or make you compromise on who you are. I’m sorry I wish people would just accept their kids for who they are rather than trying to force them to fit into some mold that was never them to begin with. I truly hope they come around and accept you for you because you are clearly a far better daughter than they deserve."	z5i1so	trans	233	0.97	2022-11-26 21:10:25
Just realized I'm MTF and I need help	"Hi all, I just want to start by saying this is very scary for me, even with the anonymity.  


But, a week or so ago, I got high and uncovered some repressed memories of when I would try on my mother's clothes when I was home alone and it just feeling... right?  


After that I started having dreams where I was a woman, nothing sexual just day to day life but as a woman, and I felt sad when I woke up and saw myself in the mirror.  


This is all so new to me... and I just... don't know what to do."	"Everyone here is very very helpful and super supportive, so whenever you come up with a specific question, don't hesistate to pop it here because chances are someone's had the exact same problem. What would you like to be called? 💞 - Lexi
Welcome!

The Dysphoria Bible is a good place to start \[it's a long, but good, read\]...can also experiment, or make an appointment with a therapist that has trans/GSRM \[Gender, Sexuality, and Romantic Minorities\] experience.  

Most importantly though, don't lose heart...feeling overwhelmed at this point is normal.  ""Holy shit, this fundamental part of my identity...isn't"" is a LOT to process.
Take some time to research if you want, it may take you awhile to really know, you may even be in denial for quite sometime but it’ll all be on your own timing of whatever you decide you are.

Ask yourself these questions:
Can you see yourself as an old woman in the future? Can you see yourself as an old man in the future? Which do you feel more happier and euphoric about? How does it feel if people online call you she/her/ma’am/miss/lady/girly? All of those feminine pronouns?
Hey Penelope. I relate hard to the memories, I'll say not to be surprised if more come up to the surface in your near future. Welcome to the community :D
I'd say do what you want to do. Which involves figuring out what you want to do.

I'll provide some commonly chosen actions with a disclaimer that this list is neither exhaustive and nothing here is necessary to be yourself:

* Feminizing Hormone Replacement Therapy
* Name Change
* Pronoun change
* Changes to how you dress
* Hair Removal
* Makeup
* Voice training
* Surgeries
* Social transition

The most important thing to do in my mind is this: Remember that no matter what you are: wonderful, valid, deserving of love, deserving of respect, and uniquely yourself. Remember that should you decide to transition to keep each action small. It is so easy to see this all as once colossal thing, a monolith that cannot be overcome. Try to see that everything can be done with small steps in the right direction. You have the rest of your life to both figure out who you are and to help yourself achieve what it is you desire. 

Remember to give yourself time and space and to take breaks, find time to enjoy yourself, and always seek what brings you joy and fulfilment.
We ruv you Penelope 💜💜💜
Hey Penelope, I'm relatively new here as well and just wanted to say that it will start off a little  overwhelming, but transitioning is not just one big leap but a hundred small steps. You can take these steps as fast as you want, or as slow as you want, but regardless you have people here you can ask for advice. I saw some other people mention this, and I'll reccomend it too, check out the gender dysphoria bible as it is a brilliant resource for new people in the community. Best of luck! - Ash
Hello, my name is Feyla (she/her)
I know grappling with gender stuff can be difficult, if you ever need to chat my DMs are open to any trans or trans questioning person that needs someone to talk to.
I actually just came out to my parents today and this is all new to me too. Welcome to the club!
Hi Penelope! The feeling of finding yourself gets familiar but never old.

Something I found helpful when I just came out was looking up a list of gender labels and seeing what fit. Also, the gender unicorn is a helpful exercise.

https://transstudent.org/gender/
This path you are seeing before you in trepidation ia a beautiful journey of little steps and leaps of faith.Its is uniquely your own but you are not alone there are many Beautiful Humans you can and will share it with.The path is always waiting and it's never to late because its not a race it's a journey ❤
Hey Gorgeous, my journey started exactly the same way. Dreams and unrepressing the deeper meaning behind my cross-dressing while lit af, honestly it's been some of the most empowering life experiences to date. For me it always felt overwhelming, I never really had any of the support or resources, or starting points. It all felt... So surreal, like a dream where there were supposed to be a few more guide posts? 🤷🏻‍♀️ But my advice? Trust your friends and try as much as you possibly feel comfortable. Everything that makes you feel more you, do it. Some of itay seem so scary at first and honestly sometimes that's the best part, that can help point you in the direction you actually want to go. Unsure about that? Talk to your friends, ask about what aesthetics their into and where their inspirations came from, realising that fear of taking that next step isn't just you ❤️
PS. Love the name- you're beautiful ❤️❤️❤️

~ Isabelle 💗
woah /pos
Thank you all for the warm welcome and advice. While this is still scary for me. Your love and support is making it easier.

I love all of you already 💖

You really know how to make a girl feel special!
I remember when my egg cracked. It’s pretty scary because the implications are so huge. My advice would be to take it one day at a time. You have a lot of major life decisions ahead, and you’re allowed to take however long you need to figure them out
Hello Penelope. How are you? Feeling better after the post?


""I started having dreams where I was a woman, nothing sexual just day to day life but as a woman, and I felt sad when I woke up and saw myself in the mirror.""

This is very relatable. I also have those dreams. But they kinda stopped after I came out and started presenting myself as a woman. Now I dream with other stuff, ""regular"" stuff. I'm still a woman in those dreams, but it's different, it's not what the dream is about anymore, you know?
Welcome!

This can be anxiety provoking at first - many of us have been there. It gets easier.

Being able to say it is a big thing, and you should feel proud of yourself for talking about it here!

The dreams of being a woman without a sexual aspect are very common for trans women before we come out.

What to do is the harder part - do you have any inkling of how the people in your life will respond?

In the short run, I’d encourage you to find a person you can talk to and trust with this in person, because that can help you navigate this so much to have someone you can open up to.

Spaces like this are excellent too - talking to and interacting with people who are like yourself helps so much. Even more so if you can find some groups near you.

Penelope is a lovely name! An excellent choice!
I used to wear my mom's high heels, loved the free perfume samplers on me, and got excited that I was confused for a girl on the phone. Those were also repressed for me. Now I'm wearing makeup to work and pitching my voice up, so I can relate to repressed memories and dreams.
The shock at first is ofc shocking but this is your choice , this is who you want to be in the future and you already are a beautiful girl !! 

Warm welcome , Miya 💕

Thanks! I'll have to check it out!
Can't recommend the dysphoria Bible enough, it's awesome!!
I'm sure there are more, but I'll make sure I'm ready for them when they come
I ruv you too!
Hi Feyla, thank you for the offer. You can never have too many friends
That's incredibly brave, I don't think I will ever be able to do that. My mother is a tiny town protestant, so she is very... conservative in her views, I'm not sure about my father though, we're kind of estranged.
Thank you for that <3
Thank you, I'll take that to heart. File it right next to cheese and wine ❤️  


It's honestly so comforting knowing that I'm not alone. Well, I knew that I wasn't going to be alone but this helped me finally believe it
Isabelle is a gorgeous name ❤️❤️❤️
Hi, and yes. I am feeling better after the post and seeing all the wonderful support. You all have just been simply fantastic!

Hi Ronan, thank you so much for the warm welcome
Just a new girl in a new year ❤
What uuuup gurl. How yah doing? :)
Hey Penelope, I’m Iris 🥰 I discovered after many years I’m bisexual, I know it’s not the same but I also only recently remembered the things I had repressed, like you’ve always known but somehow that part of your brain just… disappeared? Until you find it again and I’m happy you’ve found your true self again ❤️ if you need someone to talk to or just anything I’m here 😘
Better now that the initial shock is starting to wear off :)
Hi Iris, lovely name, pleasure to meet you.  


I have a theory that my childhood memories being repressed could be because my mother had several abusive boyfriends during my critical development years. Ages 9-16 weren't all that great.

Can I call myself a Femboy	I am a non-binary transmacs person. I use He/ They pronouns. I usually dress pretty neutral but usually lean more towards masculine presenting. Growing up my parents just thought I was modest little did they know I was just queer. Anyways, I have recently discovered I feel attractive af in some sharp eyeliner skirt. Sometimes I'll pair it with a button down to, in my own mind balance out the femininity, other times I feel like wearing a bit more revealing clothing to show off my chest but it really depends on the vibes and the fit. Regardless even as I'm all dolled up and feeling myself I feel like I don't have the right to call myself a femboy because I am non-binary. Would it invalidating of my own identity and/or others? Or am I overthinking this?	"if youre a guy/guy-adjacent and you like to dress femininely, yes
You can call yourself whatever you like, it's your identity.
I am a trans woman dating a femboy! 🥰

While he happens to be cis, him being a trans man or trans masc non-binary wouldn't change a thing for me.

I actually like the term ""femboy"" as I feel it normalizes the idea of men presenting femininely. It's really screwed up how much more rigid gender expression boundaries are for men.

Also the more people start to associate it with feminine men, the more they start to realize them and trans women are totally different groups lmfao
Anyone can call themselves a femboy if that's how they want to identify. Periodt.
I am a trans guy and a drag queen who hasn't gotten top surgery yet and doesn't have a binder, so fuck gender. screw around with it, don't, whatever you want to do, and enjoy your feminity, masculinity, whatever tf u want. and enjoy!
You're free to call yourself anything you want :)
femboy is a state of mind baby 😎
Of course you can. There’s a term that I use (idk if it’s a thing or not) called “femby” (i know it’s weird, but it’s all I got for femboy and enby) but you can use whatever you like. Labels are there for you to experiment with.
100% if that’s what you want.
Thanks yall for your validation it so hard to get that out irl, I did see a comment that they didn't understand why non-binary person are flooding r/trans ... do non-binary people not fall under the trans umbrella... im sure that's why they deleted their comment but I'd like to say that I use the term trans to identify myself when introducing myself to new people. Just wanted to let that person that I did see that and that invalidity someone's gender identity can undo some hard work for a person to get to that point of their gender journey. Lucky I am not one of those people. 

Again thank yall for all the nice validated replies, im currently looking at some makeup inspos. 
Have a lovely day yall ☺️🌸
If someone uses he/they pronouns is it implied that him is an ok pronoun to use as well since it’s a derivative of he?
call yourself whatever you want my friend ! its Your identity
Sure, it’s a pretty accepting community. If you wear a skirt and society doesn’t want you to, you’re welcome.
NO! YOU HAVE TO FOLLOW WHAT I TELL YOU! YOU ARE NOT VALID! /s
My boyfriend identifies basically exactly the same and calls himself a femboy all the time. Frankly as long as you fit either descriptor to some extent I don’t see anything wrong going with it
Femboy isn't what you are, it's how you *feel*

But seriously, if that feels good to you, go for it 😊
I'm nonbinary/agender and I'm a femboy.
I'm trans mtf and call myself a femboy as occasionally I'm more like I don't have the energy to be 100% feminine so I just put on girly stuff
Check out r/ftmfemininity , I’m non-binary transmac too and I’ve found the sub to be super affirming!
Boy ✔️ 
Dresses femininely ✔️ 
Checks out ✌️
Im also a transmasc enby who uses he/they pronouns and i consider myself a femboy too uwu
i think femboy has been a derogatory term towards transfem people historically so i would be hesitant to use it as someone who isn't transfem. probably need to research it
Call yourself whatever you want
Buddy you can call yourself almost anything you want as long as you aren’t trying to make people uncomfortable by using it for them too against their wishes
the only people who can't really call themselves a femboy are girls so your fine to call yourself a femboy
Hmmm let’s see here...

* Guy/guy-adjacent ✅

* Enjoys presenting feminine ✅

Yep, sounds like a femboy to me.
If you want to be a femboy and you feel like a femboy then surely you are one right! 😁
If you think it fits, go ahead! It’s your identity, you can do what you’d like with it!
As a fem boy, you’re a fem boy. Here’s ur title and membership card 💳
I mean why not right. If anybody gets offended that’s their problem, especially when ur not even hurting anybody by doing this
So you're a guy (or enby) who sometimes enjoys crossdressing in women's clothes.  I see no problem here.  Fly your femboy flag high!
Yeah
Absolutely. I’m also a trans-masc individual. I want to be feminine in the way that men are.
You can call yourself whatever you want if it makes you happy!
> non-binary transmacs person

Ik you mean masc but... transmac and cheese
I mean femboy is a feminine boy and most of the time they dress feminine
But I mean call ur self anything that makes u happy
Thanks your comment makes me feel very valid 🥺❤️
Thanks, I have a lot of self doubt I deal with and perhaps still trying to unlearn the inner misogyny I have towards myself. It's a constant battle between seeking the validation of strangers to pass and then also just living my best queer life.
🥺❤️
I love that ❤️‍🔥
As someone who uses he/they pronouns yes. It just means that I use both he/him and they/them to define myself.
I think im the same way. And I feel a bit more comfortable wearing it out because I've been on T for nearly a year and it has helped with my confidence over all but the energy of it all. It's worth it when we are finished and be looking cute af tho ❤️‍🔥
Surprised ur the only comment I see about this… entire comment section seems to think it’s a good idea to throw around a term that’s used to put down our trans sisters (trans fem and trans women)

Edit: had to fix a sentence
I would never! I only use queer terms on myself, even when talking to other lgbt friends. One can never be 100% with what someone is comfortable with
🫂🥺❤️
The word queer use to be use as a derogatory word as well and the lgbt community has taken back by the community, and it was clear to me when I used the queer to identify myself at work and my 60+ yr old still use it as an insult I have heard them say it in conversations. That's besides the point. My understanding of a femboy before this comment was obviously aimed towards cismen that were more feminine or feminine presenting. 

If a person that identifies with male  pronouns and is more feminine and decides to choose to dress or have pink bed sheets would it be wrong for them to refer to themselves as a femboy?

I can recognize that derogatory terms exist in every minority group and of course those terms are damaging there is no denying that. 

But within those communities there is reclamation of those terms. If it's not my term to reclaim so be it, perhaps I'm confused as to what a femboy is because again I just thought it was the thought of a male person breaking the gender norms of masculinity...I felt empowered up till this point and I am doing more research about it....

Edit: I did want to add that I did some research on the origin and the word is rather new dating back to the 1990s( I'm 25 so that's new to me ) and I can see where transfem people would find it damaging because of the history of fetishization of them with other similar terms that are variation of femboy. 
The word femboy is used to describe men with feminine features or that dressed more feminine, it can definitely be used to belittle a transwoman but only if the person using that word chooses to use it with that intent. In a lot of discussions I've seen so far transfem really do not care if they are not being called that. 
I'm a dude that likes to be feminine therefore a femboy. My sister inlaw is a trans woman that thinks the term can be used for men and men presenting people who are feminine and dress more feminine, she did say she wouldn't be to happy if someone called her that because she in fact not a man.
Then you’re all good!
true, but queer is more of a general term used for anyone who looks anything other than cishet, femboy was specifically used for transfem people and probably some feminine cis men according to my knowledge. all my knowledge is secondhand so i should probably do some research too. i think recently the term has been used for any man who is feminine, but there's still the history/context of the word. i'd say yeah we should probably both do research, maybe you can find a similar term to use for yourself that doesn't have the same baggage
You can refer to my edit, I did do some research and I did look into the discourse of the word usage. Any similar term like flowerboy or laverderboy that essentially mean the same thing are going to have that same context. The term flowerboy was appropriated from Asian culture to describe feminine men the same with lavender boy, it wasnt appropriated but it essentially is the same thing. The word femboy felt empowering to me. Like yes im a feminine boy I can still identify as he and wear whatever I want with out people invalidity my identity. What is the difference between a cisman being referring to himself as a femboy and a transperson do that. Regardless, minority groups are allowed to take back those words. I think if men or men presenting people like myself refer to themselves and only themselves as femboys it wouldn't be harming transfem people because they are not throwing femboy at them. 

The comment did make my gender identity feel a little invalid but I did learn something new today, so thank you. And I hope you can take something out of this too.
alright, since youre acknowledging the history and being very respectful with it i don't see an issue :D thanks for telling me your research because mine just resulted in gender wikis which i don't trust for historical information. i'm glad you found a term that works for you :3
Yeah had to do a deep dive, and luckily, like I mentioned my sister in law is trans so I asked her opinion as well. She's personally doesn't use it for herself and wouldn't like it if someone referred to her as that, but she doesn't mind when others use it."	wyh4e4	trans	232	0.97	2022-08-26 18:52:57
Celebrating getting out of my comfort zone	So this might sound silly but last weekend was my first time presenting feminine in public in a non queer focused place. And I’m a year and a half into my transition. Unless my friends and I were going to a lgbt heavy place I always boymoded no matter how good I thought I looked. But I eventually got tired of trying to “stealth”. So with the help of my friends I finally got the courage to go downtown with them, get coffee, go clothes shopping, and visit my favorite bookstore for the first time as myself and not “the other guy”. The real kicker, my biggest fear which I thought would be inevitable never happened, no body looked at me. Even before transitioning I had severe spotlight syndrome I thought if I ever presented fem I would be mocked by everyone I passed on the sidewalk. But surprisingly except for a glance from an old woman no one looked at me or cared who I was. It was so bizarre. I felt normal for the first time in my journey. I just blended in.	"You look so cute, girl! I know passing isn’t the end all be all of transitioning, nor is it everyone’s aim, but you pass, my dear. I’m digging your jacket
You are so beautiful, congratulations!
Epic beauty IMO :)
Ashley!!! <3 love seeing you living it.
I love your smile, and I hope that you are going to feel comfortable soon! You are adorable!
I am happy for you, and you looking great 😊
I get told I pass but I often don’t feel it. I jokingly tell my friends I see an NFL linebacker in the mirror most days
Oh, that’s so rough to hear. Do you mind if I ask how long your transitioning journey has been?
Socially a year and a half like my caption says on this post. But medically only 8 months.
It’s an oft repeated thing, but the mind changes slower than the body. You ever notice folks who lose or gain a whole bunch of weight still think of themselves as their previous size for a bit? Or when folks get their hair styled dramatically differently can still surprise themselves in the mirror? You’re not just transitioning physically; you’re transitioning your mental image of yourself and unfortunately, that can be painfully slow."	12k9nw9	trans	223	0.96	2023-04-13 03:03:31
(repost since posted when r/trans went down)Heyyo Lovelies <333 So for todays question! What is the most liberating thing for you about being trans. Mine is the ability to express myself as i want with clothing and makeup. I live for that stuff <333 Have a great day, sending hugz. 11 months hrt		"Off topic: you are transition goals
Cute top and love your makeup. Have a great day too! Hugs back!
Being able to act/move how I want.   It was the mannerisms I had to hide the most before.  Now it's all unlearning past behavior and posturing.   I do this thing where I roll my shoulders forward and up.   Basically making myself look bigger then I am.   I was a pretty skinny dude,  it made a good blending mechanism..  but now it just looks stupid..  hell it probably always did. 

Clothing comes in a close second.   I spent the first year of transition absolutely refusing to wear flat shoes. 

Oh God I can't forget eyeliner..  i like the shape my eyes take with a little makeup so much better then what I looked like before.   I used to think I was so ugly.   Just so plain looking.   It's often get told I was attractive but I could never see it.
You look great 😊
Wow so beautiful looking amazing
The most liberating thing... hmmm. I'd have to say the genuine happiness I feel when I look in the mirror now and seeing the person I always felt like inside. 
P.S. I wanted to say I LOVE you're makeup. You've truly made it into an art form.
Definitely clothing.

Just got my TomSka pride tee!! This is my first fem fitting piece of clothing and it feels so great to wear~ <3		"It's always a good feeling when an artist you like is supportive. I've watched ASDF  many times when I was upset throughout the years, and this just makes me happy
im buying this shirt
I want this
I need one
Is this legit tomska merch?
My dad agreed to buy me one

Yes. It was a limited run for pride month, however.

Ik clothing obviously =/= gender, but my dumb gender-euphoria-driven brain doesn’t understand lol (prom; MtNB)		"You look great!
You look so happy. Keep it up.
That's such a pretty dress, and it suits you :)
[deleted]
Lookin adorable!
You look so cute love the dress
Of course you're right, but clothing still can be a nice way to express oneself and helped me with my dysphoria a lot! It's less how you are seen by society but more like really feeling comfortable wearing clothes you like and that suit you, so, enjoy! And the dress does really suit you, you look beautiful :)
Look great
I was gonna say that😂
awwww ty!
Thanks! I’ll try haha

Tried makeup for the first time and thought it didn't look that bad, so I showed this to my best friend (who is cis but likes wearing girl clothes) as a coming out and he said, he can still see the masculine face and that I'm male. Thanks, I hate this pic now... (he's supportive tho, just dumb)		"You look totally gorgeous, don't worry at all. Sadly our friends and family, who know us pre-transition, will probably always still see our old face, no matter how passable and beautiful we are. The brains are just ineffective updating the info of our loved ones xD
You look gorgeous!! This makeup is flawless! I hope I get that good ☺️
Saying you have a masculine face isn't great, and in my opinion he's wrong there, but him asserting you're male is actually harmful. How can he be supportive if he doesn't accept that you're a woman? Did you discuss this with him? Did he change his thinking? If not, he's not actually supportive.
He’s flat out wrong there, you look amazing and v feminine
I have a hard time seeing the ""male"" in there. Then again I don't really care because you look beautiful regardless.
I think he was just trying to annoy you, You look so good!
Nuh uh, you pass to me!
You definitely look beautiful and chic
Idk what he's talking about cuz you look fabulous af
Pretty
Honestly i would never have guessed you were trans based on the photo, but like someone else said people who knew you pre transition sometimes have trouble seeing what you actually look like. Not always, though, my siblings don’t see it in me anymore, so just don’t give too much thought to it
If I passed you on the street, I wouldn't even bat an eye. You pass easilly.
You are adorable!
That's just his insecurities coming out.  This pic is def very feminine.  


Edit to add:  Or he's known you for so long he sees your face underneath.  Can't see as an impartial observer.
Honey you look beautiful!!!!
You look amazing!! It took me until reading what you said to even have any comprehension that you aren’t cis.
Damn you look amazing
Gorgeous
YA!,,,,,,,,He’s a dumbass. LOL 😝
Very hot!
Girl he's tripping, you look stunning 😍
You're art.
Pretty sure Gina Carano looks more like a guy than you.
Wow look at you so beautiful
You 100% pass! I would take you home!
You are fuckin gorgeous
Beautiful. Maybe you need a more thoughtful and supportive friend.
I think you did very good for a first time!
Now to be blunt and honest there is a certain lack of countouring that flattens your lineaments a bit, which is a common “male” mistake if that’s what your friend meant.

But honestly, it’s perfect 👌 in time you’ll get soooo good at this!
People often look for what they want to see/expect to see. You’re beautiful. Like others said, passing you on the street, all I could see is girl.
[removed]
You look sexy as hell, your friend is an idiot
He may be ""supportive"" but he's also wrong and rude.
That's the kind of dumbness I'd rip someone's head off for I'm still closeted and am looking forward to when I'll hopefully stop getting misgendered by everyone even my mum misgenders me and she thinks I'm non binary but she just refuses to he decent about it so probably will do the same when I tell her I'm trans
Your profile description says „transgender femboy“ so wouldn’t what he said kinda be a compliment?
You look amazing!
Totally what I was thinking. It can be a little bit depressing and sometimes offensive but you can't just erase their memories and as long as they try their best to be supportive, I don't mind at all. Haha
I believe this is most of what's happening.
I'm glad, you like it. I needed hours and lots of youtube videos. Hehe
We were just talking about girl clothes and makeup, so I decided to show him my first try, while telling I'm transgender. Till I said that, he thought I'd be male. I think he said that, because we were a little bit drunk and he had in mind, that I was only crossdressing so he wanted to look behind the ""disguise"" and find some masculine details. After I made it clear, he asked me about how I feel, how he should call me, the totally common ""what's your orientation"" question and stuff and said that he wants to go shopping with me. Like I said, he is a little blunt and dumb, but just because he's not good with words. He has a pure heart.
Lmao thank you <3
Nah, he's cool. He just always talks before thinking. I know, he didn't mean it like that.
This is a really toxic thought, right here. The friend was honest. I'll take honesty from supportive and loving family members and friends over them lying to me because they think it's what I want to hear, even if it gives me dysphoria. This idea that we should dump people in our lives who aren't perfectly supportive of us is garbage. We as a group have too few friends and allies as it is, can any of us really afford to get rid of those who fall short of perfect? He should be corrected and given a chance to change his thinking, not just dumped outright.
I'm always scared that I use too much contouring, because it looks so dark and unnatural before blending
I call myself femboy, because I'm not passable enough. I do look more like a feminine boy than a woman, but I identify as a woman.
I'm looking forward to the practice! 💄🤣
I wlll leave you to your feelings. Anyway, you look great!
It’s normal, but once blended gives those shadows that you lack otherwise. Just keep countouring and you’ll love it one day! Trust me sis
You’re literally putting that stamp on yourself tho, if you identify as a woman you ARE a woman and bringing you down by calling yourself „a femboy“ because you’re „not passable“ enough isn’t gonna help you in any way. It won’t change your face structure, it won’t give you more boobs, it won’t make you more feminine. I mean you call your friend dumb for saying that he still sees your „masculine“ face, but then you even call yourself a femBOY instead of celebrating maybe other feminine features on yourself.
You're right. It's just hard accepting yourself as you are and breaking out of a role you literally lived your whole life. Some people build up the confidence to fight for their pronouns and stuff and others can't. I'm still pre everything (going to start hrt tomorrow) and if I look in the mirror, I see a guy and it feels like lying to myself if I just deny that. There's a difference between I tell people that I'm a boy (to feel safe) or I'm a girl (to say the truth) and other people tell me, what I am, which can be hurtful. I'm also not outed to the whole world yet. Just to my close friends and family. I hope you understand what I mean.

I didn't mean to call my friend dumb, just because he said that. He's my best friend and like I said, he's just not good with words. It was kinda like that: I said ""hey, look I'm transgender"" and he said ""Oh, cool. I like your style. You look passable but I can still see that you're a man, because you still look masculine there.""
Which is a little bit dumb.

But yeah, I'm going to change my bio. Thank you for your opinion.
Sis, you’re a WOMANA look at you. There’s no need to call yourself something that you’re not, and next time someone says something rude to you even if it’s a good friend, check them. They won’t do it again if you’re upfront about it!  💗"	lwm8gb	trans	223	0.99	2021-03-03 05:30:09

Im trans and I wanted to end my life. With everything happening and me being homeless. I ll be starting my new job at Doggy Daycare Monday. I'm not only praying things get better I'm going to put in the work too	I love dogs so that is a plus. Maybe my failed attempted of ending my life actually did help. I have nothing but a phone and the same 2-3 clothes I wear a day. I ask that you all just keep me in your prayers	"I'm so proud of you! You got this.
Dogs are the best! You got this!
Praying I get the things needed to make a great first day impression
You can do it I know you can life may seem bad but everything works out in the end stay strong.
I don’t prey, but I’ll make an exception for you. I’m currently homeless too sweetie bouncing between friends homes, but I’m right on the cusp of getting back on my own two feet, and I know you can get back on track too. And yes, having a job you love is paramount, glad you were able to get it. Stay strong, and yes, your a survivor! Keep on showing the world that you don’t know the meaning of quit.
Wishing you nothing but good vibes. Take one day at a time.
❤️ Whoever commented I can't see it anymore. I do have that and I ll posted my info at the top of my profile description. If anyone wanted to he lp or just follow me I ll keep everyone updated
Go get it ! I wish you the best 🌺
Sending lots of prayers ❤️
I'm so impressed by you! Turning everything around like that and getting a job couldn't been easy and your determination is so impressive! Best of luck going forward! ❤️
[Aaaaah! Dogs!](https://imgur.com/a/nzWrUfH)
Oh god, be careful at doggy daycare places. I worked at one that was terrible, used your emotional attachment to the animals to pay you slave wages. All while recording your every move and word (even in the break room!!)

Companies are never your friend or family. They're simply your access to the things you need to live. Stay strong and best wishes!
I'll pray to Dio for you darling, stay strong and pat the doggos xxxx
>I'm going to put in the work too

This is something that is massively overlook by humans in general when shit gets bad. People love to talk about ""positive vibes"" and ""believing in yourself"". The harsh reality is that you not only have to change your mindset, you gotta put in *work.* The universe is never going to hand you a win. And I don't mean this as some ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" bullshit. I mean that nothing changes unless you put in some effort. That effort can look different for each individual and each situation, but the effort has to be made.

So good for you. I'm proud of you. You've been in a really difficult place for I don't even know how long, and now you're starting a new job and you've already set yourself up for success by recognizing that you need to put in the work. Now go slay!
I’m so proud of you for finding something to give you hope. Hope is precious, and so are dogs.
Good luck! I hope this is the beginning of things turning up for you 💙
I am leaving the prayers aside and focusing on your work. Congrats on finding a job you like. 
One sure way to get rich: Save you money and work hard.

Came out to 96 year old gran	"I am 49yo fully transitioned woman.  I’ve worked abroad for years.  I am very close to my grandmother, who was a big part of raising me.  Thing is, she’s very conservative, catholic and born in 1926.  I didn’t transition 20 years earlier because of fear of losing her and the rest of my family.

So, I would call my gran and speak to her on the phone.  She has told me I sounded different in the last year or two.  Anyway, last week I flew back and went to see her.  My mother warned her a day or two in advance.

She took it really well.  After adjusting to the new reality a bit she asked me, so now you have had that operation, do you sleep with men or women.  

I told her, I am more interested in how someone treats me than their gender.

So, you sleep with men and women?  That makes sense, she said.

I was floored.  Decades of fear about her reaction!

I had a lot of loss in my transition.  This was the loss I feared the most.  But she has bought me earrings, been clothes shopping with me.  Told me I dress nicely.  

You never know.  Really blown away."	"Aaaaa I’m so happy for you!! ;D
I know it’s always kinda confusing on whether or not to come out to family that’s either conservative, religious, or both, but you did it with an awesome reaction! 
I hope all the best for you ;3
I'm glad you got to meet her as yourself :) she sounds like a lovely lady and I hope she stays healthy and happy!
my grandma was happy to accept my transition, though she is pissed i ruined my strawberry blond hair with gallons hair dye
Wholesome grandma for the win! I'm happy for you ❤️
Oh WOW
Thats fantastic! I am so glad she was so accepting!! I dyed my hair and my grandmother stopped eating for a week, so I think she'd keel over if I told her I was trans.
This is so darn sweet!! Thank you for sharing!
So happy for you! Similar experience with a relative of mine. Sends bible quotes in texts etc, always loved her but wasn’t sure if my transitioning would destroy that. She ended up embracing me for it and said that her church is actually very welcome of all people (LGBT) included and she was happy for me and finding what fulfills me. Didn’t expect it at all- really blown away by it. Never know till you find out I guess.
Yay! These sorts of stories restore my faith in humanity a bit. It gives me hope. Too few people have this sort of reception from conservative family members, but it's so encouraging to know that a 96 yr old can adjust and still love and support her grandchild, regardless of their gender identity. Progress is being made, representation makes a difference, it's the irrational fear of the unknown/different that really trips up humanity. It's always good to see love overcome fear like this. 🌈💜
this is so wholesome🥹extremely happy for you 💕
It’s such a shame these kind of experiences are too rare and not just what we should all enjoy.
Thanks for your heartwarming comment.  :/). I was so shocked.  I honestly thought I’d never see her again."	y1ylwq	trans	221	1.0	2022-10-12 08:51:16

Transphobe karma	Im still in the closet as a trans girl, last summer I had to spend 2 weeks with my step grandparents in North Carolina. I found out they were very far right and extremely transphobic. This Christmas they sent me a $50 amazon gift card. Its nice they sent me a gift card (they still think im cishet) and while staring at it a devious thought entered my mind. Why not spend their hard earned money on a shit ton of girl clothes. They'd basically be finding an enemy. I am now look at skirts and wigs to get. Thanks to my transphobic step family for undirectly getting trans stuff ;p	"Awesome payback!!! Make sure those skirts are short and spinnneeeeee ❤❤❤
You are e Hero
lol that's like the US sponsoring a terrorist group only for that terrorist group to become their enemy
U're a fucking genius
Power move! Good job, is it weird to say im proud of you? Cause i am, lol i dont know you but im proud of you!
Good job!
Hey yo what the f***
Which has.... Happened way too many times.

Maybe if they had a smaller military budget they'd be slightly less reckless with who they sponsor

My mom always wanted boys, but won't accept me being one	"I'm FTM, she always talks about if only she had twin boys after me and my older sister. How amazing and wonderful it'd be to have boys to do boy stuff with, and how rowdy and wonderful they'd be. Are you fucking kidding me!!

If I told her I'm trans she'd yell and scream at me how wrong I am and that I was born a female and so that's what I am. Yet she dreams of having adorable boys as her children. Fucker, I am your boy, you never give me the chance to be that!

I try to buy clothes I like, but she's like ""maintain the balance, you always dress too boyish!"" ""gay people will be into you!"" I want to do all the boy things, wear the clothes, do active activities, be manly and strong, but you won't let me!! I've always hated all this girly stuff, hated dresses, hated doing feminine activities, you don't see this. Why do we assume it's in the female DNA to love all this feminine torture!

Just because I was cursed with a female body, I am your son, you got one years ago! Stop being hypocritical and let me be your son, let me be myself!  
Jokes on her, I'm 20 and taking HRT stealth, I'll transform before her eyes."	"Absolutely slay my guy
Yes, she'll be so confused one day. Keep being you dude.
Bro my mom is similar. She says she wants a daughter but doesn't accept me as her daughter 🥲.
Here, king, you dropped this! 👑
suggest you go camping. it’s not necessarily gendered but to her it probably is, if she sees you taking charge she will stop associating being trans with a negative connotation
My little sister did that! Growing up, she was always saying how she wished I was a girl, and now that I am one, she’s mad about it.
Have you tried the tried and true method of

Beating them up?
May not be relevant in your scenario, but want to share mine. I'm mtf and growing up anytime I wanted to do something ""girly"" my Mom was against it because I was a boy. Made me terrified to come out. Finally at 32 I decided to do it, and she's perfectly fine with it. Suddenly doesn't mind me piercing my ears, wearing what I want, etc. She accepts me as I am, but couldn't get over the ingrained gender norms she grew up with being Korean. But now that she knows I identify as female she has no issue. It's messed up, it's not right, but it's her. It doesn't even have to do with how she is with other people, but with her kids boys are boys and girls are girls. Once I was a girl she could accept me doing girl things.
I feel like she's more scared of you being gay than being a boy, at least with the sentence ""gay people will be into you"", it comes off as this. It might be internalized homophobia of some sort. Maybe I'm thinking about it too deep, but it comes off as this.
I’m in almost an identical situation but the other way around (MtF) and the hypocrisy is absolute, good luck with your stealth transition 😁
i love the little plot twist at the end. all luck to u, my man!
Unsupportive parents are the worst. For me it's pretty much the exact same situation but with my dad. He wants me to be a manly boy and I have a very manly appearance. 6'4 big body the kinda thing where if I exercised I could be a very strong guy but I just want to do feminine things and have zero interest in guy stuff. If I were to come out to him he'd almost certainly be angry since he has shown many homophobic tendencies as well as transphobic ones. Yeah unsupportive parents suck they really do. Show your mom who you really are and don't let her stop you.
Me irl. My therapist was like that’s ironic.

mom's reaction to my coming out (cw: suicidal thoughts)	"I'm 18mtf and formally came out to my parents \~a week ago, they had already found my fem clothes and makeup before so I assumed it wouldn't be a huge shock but I was very wrong. My dad took it alright but it seems like it's absolutely destroyed my mother. She's been barely sleeping and just hobbles around everywhere and talks very quietly, almost like a whisper. She's been continuously taking a few different pills every day and started smoking again for the first time in like 25 years. She came to me today and just went on about how it's all ""destroyed her life,"" how she's been physically unable to talk to any of our relatives and how she's thinking about quitting her job because it's ""such a struggle now."" She told me the only reason she hasn't killed herself yet is because she needs to be there for my two sisters and doesn't want to leave my dad to deal with everything alone. 

She's been urging me a lot to ""just wait,"" because she thinks I'm too young to know for sure if this is what I want, but after a few years of seriously thinking about and actually trying presenting feminine in public,  I'm all but sure about it. I'm fucking tired of waiting and hiding and I really want to start just being more feminine in my everyday life, but I'm really scared that my mom will actually do something drastic if I do. Normally I wouldn't care and just say it's her problem, but at the end of the day she's my mom and I would never forgive myself if I was the reason she offed herself.

This is partly a vent and partly asking for advice, though I'm not sure there's anything I *can* really do here. My dad has arranged for us to see a family therapist in a few days so I'm just really hoping that helps this somehow. I'm just really conflicted and really scared."	"It sounds to me like your mother was already mentally unstable before you told her and that you telling her brought her back because of stress or something like that. Otherwise, why would she be thinking of unaliving herself simply because of an important change in her life. Anyway, therapy is the only way to solve this situation imo, so i hope it goes well.
Honestly your mother sounds like a narcissist
The crap she's pulling on you isn't your fault, or problem. That's quite the toxic and dramatic game she's playing.

Also sorry about everything 🥺
Get her a carton of cigarettes. If she's willing to put all of that on you, when will she stop and give you agency? She won't and like you said she's already admitted she's using this as control when she says that she won't because your sisters.
Jesus Christ what a fucking drama queen she is. Emotional manipulation narcissistic bullshit tell her to get a fucking therapist what the fuck talking to your kid like that completely irresponsible conditional-love fail parenting. 

Love the child not the gender, goddamn worthless bigots.
you should tell her that it is your identity and that she needs to stop acting like a transphobic banana peel
Take it from someone who waited for 10 years to not upset their mother, DON'T. Your happiness is not with trading for their comfort.
First, I think it would be best if you talked to a professional, both for your mother's sake and yours and your family's. Your relationship can still be fixed, and your mother CAN come around. Please know that you are loved, even by this random fellow on the internet, and I'm very sorry for your mother's behavior and the emotional toll this having on you and your family.

Second, I think you should tell her that this transition makes you happy. This is who you are. And life is about finding your own little slice of happiness. And this makes you happy. Being you.
Just putting this out there but I've never known someone who uses suicide as an ultimatum to actually be serious about going through with it.

It's a system of control, a threat.
I really don't get parents that make this about themselves instead of their kids. It is ok to not understand, it is ok to worry.... What is not ok is to act like this, there is no situation in which she got depressed because of you, she got depressed because she thinks so much about herself over you, she managed to make your well-being entirely about herself.
This is textbook manipulation. Go to r/raisedbynarccissists and you find suicide threats there a lot. If you are genuinely concerned call a suicide hotline
Do you think she’s just trying to scare you out of transitioning?
First off—congratulations. I feel happy when I hear that you have learned this about yourself. Well done. Secondly—you could never make someone suicidal! It would be just as strange to think she could’ve made you a woman. She is who she is, and she has to learn how to be with herself just as you’ve had to—and have to—do the same. You cannot make her be someone else—just as she can’t make you be someone else. You cannot make her love her life. You can’t make her take care of herself. She has to find these things on her own and in her own time. Those are her responsibility. It is your responsibility to love your life! Be the woman you are for the world!

The truth of any feeling is that it is fleeting; you feel it and it passes, the mind jumps about from this topic to that topic, the body jumps about from this feeling to that feeling, together feeling all random assortments of things like a social media feed. When we examine our mind and our feelings and observe their fleeting nature, we begin to understand ourselves, and feel peace. That is the process that I wish for you and your mother. But no one can help her but herself. It is good to be patient and gentle with her when you can, and at the same time good to be firm—firm that you know your truth, it cannot be changed because she wishes otherwise.

If she gets better she may feel regret that she did not take this opportunity to congratulate you and celebrate your newfound understanding. You have shown courage and initiative; you’ve shown love for your parents in that you want to include them in your experience and share in what is a confusing and intimate time. You have done something good! It is just taking her time to understand that.

Best of luck!
What the fuck - that’s so fucked up, I’d honestly rather get kicked out on the streets than have a parent react that way. I’m really sorry to have to go through this. Don’t listen to shit she says it’s her problem not yours. Stay safe
To me it looks like your mother is emotionally unstable but a huge part of what you see is probably her trying to manipulate you to be her ""good son"".

I think you should take her to psychologist or something but don't let her manipulate you.
I’m probably close to your mom’s age.  I’ll say this right off the bat, if she kills herself, it is NOT your fault. 

Even at my age, I came out to my own mother and she freaked out.  Here’s the problem with this sort of mentality, they’re making it about themselves.  It’s a common thing a lot of trans people experience - cis people acting like you being trans is about THEM.  This is not about them.  It’s about us.  We want to be true to ourselves.  

What your mother is doing is highly manipulative.  It’s narcissistic passive-aggressive bullshit meant to bully you into not transitioning.

Our parent’s happiness should not be dependent on us being cis.  My mother melted the fuck down even though I’m staying married to the same person, living in the same place, have the same job, my kids are happy, etc.  My life is highly stable.  The only difference is I’m transitioning.  And that went from her being proud of me to ashamed of me.  As far as I’m concerned, she can take that shame and choke on it.  I’m the happiest best version of myself on E.  If her happiness requires my unhappiness then she’s doing a shit job as a parent.  The same goes for your mother.  Her job as a parent is to want you to be happy in life.  Your life is yours and is not there to make her happy.
Your mom sounds very hateful at this point in time.
Just remember to give yourself a safety net and a mental focal point you can use to remember who you are, such as a dress, a purse, or a person... etc.
so any situation you are in, you can use it to stay calm and keep under control 
This is your life, and if she respected you, then she could do to better understand you rather than push you away by being disrespectful.


Find out who this family therapist is, such as an address or name... Do some research and look then up online to see what kind of therapy they do. 
I don't fully know you, your parents, or the situation, but I normally think the worst-case scenario
Fuck your parents. Fuck fuck fucking fuckity fuck them. 
Sorry I come off as aggressive but- your mom as acting all ""ÓwÒ mmm I such a wittwe babe me shad wah wah"" because you came out as trans and she's acting like her whole world is ""shattered!!!11!11"" because you're trans. Like she can cry about it. Because she is being so fucking awful. She's Literally   acting like a ""depressed"" asshole because you ruined her precious life. But how? You didn't do shit! Literally you came out as trans to her. How is you being trans ruining her life? Sure it might have changed her life a bit now knowing your trans female but it's not ruining her life. And honestly that's a really fucking shitty reason for her to relapse. Imagined if someone asked her that. ""Why did you start smoking again"" ""oh because my kid came out as trans and it wuined my life now I'm 
depwessed uwu "" like she's literally a narcissist. And she's literally doing this just to make you feel bad for being who you are.
And the fucking suicide baiting is disgusting.
And don't fucking listen to her. I promise you, you aren't too young to know you're trans. 
And if she offed herself, it's not her fault. She's a narcissist and is trying to guilt trip you.
Sorry if I sounded aggressive I'm just angry, (not at you of course!) That your parents are treating you like that. Even if they don't understand, they should support you for being trans. They should be like ""oh your trans? Cool."" They should try to use your correct name and pronouns, and let you wear what you feel comfortable wearing, and treat you like a person. 
I'm really sorry they said all that horrible things to you. I wish I could hug you.
If her entire mental wellbeing hinged on her ""son"" being a boy than she has much deeper issues than you will ever be able to fix. My advice is be there for your dad and rely on him, maybe even open up to him if you can. He seems very proactive getting a family therapist so it seems like he is a good guy. I would also take this as an opportunity to get yourself a therapist. Your mom putting all this pressure on you is definitely bad so hopefully having someone to talk to will help you even if you don't immediately see the psychological effects. My DMs are always open if you want to talk about how to source as a trans accepting therapist. 

Take care sister and remember no matter what she says you aren't the source of her problems, it comes from something deeply wrong with her own mental health.
Your mum is unstable and is simply being manipulative and controlling. Stay strong sister, we all love you 🏳️‍⚧️
Honestly, it is your life you are affecting and not hers, there is no real reason for her to be acting this way towards you and it is unfortunate as well as unfair. If you can be self sufficient, in the case something does happen, by all means you do you. There is (at least in my opinion) no way she could be driven to be suicidal by just the matter of you being trans. 

Good luck Valerie.
The younger you are the better if you want to start hrt. So I would recommend you to see a doctor to stop at least your current hormones so that your body stops to develop in a not wanted way. That will help your with your passing a lot in future.
I don't know how it is handled in your country but over here it's like that:

You have to make a therapy and wait 1 year to start hrt. Young individuals (maybe older ones too?) can see a doctor for lowering their hormones before starting hrt so that the body stops develope in a male or female way and after therapy and waiting you can start with hrt.

Of course it makes it easier for you if you start the hole hrt earlier, but you stopping your current hormones does help very much.

In my opinion you should start at this point and use therapy and talks with your mom to convince her.
It might be useful to know: some parents, especially mother's, tend to think that they made a mistake and that it is their fault. It is always a good idea to help them coming over this thoughts. It just takes some time and maybe some help.
Further she might be afraid of the consequences for you. Just have good and long, honest talks. Try to understand her and help her. Unfortunately it is often that way that trans ppl. have to help her environment to accept it while we are in need of help ourselfes. But I am optimistic that you can do it :)

Btw. It might help to inform about other well known trans ppl. that are successful and watching TV documentations (but not the ones were trans ppl. are mocked and so on).
The point is: show that trans are able to have a good and happy life so that your mother can make up her mind about trans being mocked and not accepted etc.
OP, it sounds like your mom has severe mental problems and that has nothing at all to with your beautiful discovery. You haven’t done anything wrong and if your mom made a choice to harm herself you would not be at fault in any way. It sounds like your mom is either having trouble coping with any kind of big change or she is making herself the center of attention on purpose and has no intention of hurting herself for real. Either way, she sounds unstable and you don’t have to take responsibility for anything she does.

Have you heard of Jeffrey Marsh? They have a series of really helpful videos that are so affirming and enlightening. They are on tiktok and YouTube and they also have a great book that might be helpful for you. It’s called How To Be You.
Sounds like a big not your problem, if it gets too bad do you have friends or relatives you can go live with? If it's really ruining your parents life's then they shouldn't mind you leaving
It sounds to me like she needs help from a counselor. Her own issues are putting her in a situation where her behavior is emotionally manipulative and emotionally abusive to you. You do not deserve that.

It hasn’t destroyed her life. If it somehow did, she may have been associating with shit people at work and in her personal life. If she has a rigid vision of your future that she is dependent on, then she was already making inconsiderate plans with respect to you being an autonomous person.

Holding yourself back from being your true self will only lead to resentment in your relationship.
Get your mum to therapy. Call a help line. She's not mentally sound. She needs help. This is not your fault, clearly she's had other issues and this has just ""broke"" her in a sense.

Don't forget your health is just as important as hers. Get her help so you can start being the woman you were meant to be without having that fear with you. ❤️
I'm going to be honest her telling you she is going to kill herself because of you is some straight up gross manipulation.  You being trans is ok and in no way justifies her behavior. She is doing this to herself and is attempting to control you in the process. You are valid and it is ok to transition and not want to wait
cluster b mom right there
This is my mom. She uses her struggles with abuse to justify her’s towards me and my dad.
If she is threatening to hurt herself, you could call crisis RESOLVE or whatever the equivalent it is in your part of the world. 

It sounds to me (with the limited information I have) that this is, at best, a plea for attention or, at worst, NPD rearing it's ugly head. I hope ypu don't let this discourage you from living your life on your terms.

Hope everything works out for you
What a cunt. She's being so incredibly over-dramatic about having a daughter instead of a son and honestly you deserve better. It's one thing to need tome to come to terms with a person you've known your whole life be a seemingly different person than what you thought and to adjust names, pronouns, etc. What she is doing is so manipulative and sad. 

If she's for real behaving like this and is not doing it for attention or whatever then she seriously needs to be taken to a therapist or psychologist because that is a deep rooted issue that she needs to get resolved, that is still not normal.
Your mom seems really unstable and I really think she needs to get professional help somehow.

It’s not your fault. So don’t think it is

Ding ding ding
Felt like I was having a flashback to telling my ""mother"", thankfully we're non-contact now and nothing of value was lost.  Would've been nice to have a mum to talk to but I've never really had that and I expected this sort of reaction so planned for it.
r/raisedbynarcissists maybe?
I'm just like here piggy backing on this wondering if you can explain in what way becuase this mom sounds like my mom too.
that is a horrible idea
She’s 18, the age to buy cigarettes was raised to 21 several years ago.
Fucking AGREED. It's so manipulative!
Dumbass parents really do be like ""I'll love my child regardless! The stop as soon as something that remotely challenges their world views 🙃😒
While I agree, I don't think this will help at all 😔

Oh ok, yeah then don't you dare to blame this on you. You don't owe her anything, and she should get help.
My mom is a narcissist. Its a lot to delve into but basically a narcissist is self-obsessed and they tie everything back to a way it impacts them. 

In my experience, my mom tries to tell me that my success and happiness is her success and happiness; she also tries to push me towards careers that she imagines to be more lucrative so I can “take care of her once I make it big.” 

To continue with another example: she tells me brother that my sister and I will make nothing of our lives and he will take care of her. She has told me that my brother and sister will be failures and that I will be the one caring for her. 

My siblings and I are all living independently of our parents; we are fully aware of our mother’s manipulation tactics. We just wish her well and try to love her from a distance. We want peace with her in case she randomly dies (which is a strong possibility).
Not everyone is American
Depends where she lives
There was a dad on here yesterday said anytime you put expectations on who your child is supposed to be, you’re going to be disappointed.
I’m sure the therapist can start working things out for everybody. I hope you both start feeling better soon! ❤️
Its a good way to express how you feel!
that sucks

Trans Women	"Quick disclaimer: I'm not in any way trying to offend or objectify anyone, this is 100% an appreciation post. If there's a problem with my post lmk and I'll fix it.

Y'all. I'm a 25yr old guy and I was stuck in a female body for 24 years. It was awkward and embarrassing and honestly cringe. I thought every female hated feminity and just kinda sucked it up because *someone* has to be a girl. Scrolling here 100% flipped that on its head. All you trans ladies, holy shit. You come on here with your bright clothes and makeup and owning all the things that I couldn't. It's really amazing and makes me happy that there are people who actively embrace the features I hid from. Every time I see a ""do I pass?"" post I don't see how you possibly couldn't. 

Keep slayin 🔥🔥"	"I feel the same way about trans guys. Seeing y'all being happy and embracing all the stuff I tried for decades and couldn't? Fucking GOLD. KEEP ROCKIN' THAT SHIT, DUDE.
Right??? I feel the same way! When I still thought I was cis, I just simply did not understand makeup! Why wear it? I don’t even want a boyfriend! What do you mean you gotta do all these steps?!

And then we have the trans women on these subs absolutely going off with their amazing makeup looks.

Even as a guy, I don’t do makeup but I’ve thought of it from time to time. It’s a very difficult thing to get the hang of in my eyes, so good on everybody who gives it a proper shot!
> I thought every female hated feminity and just kinda sucked it up because someone has to be a girl

While I didn't fall into that territory, it does seem kinda often that people of either binary gender identity have this same feeling, but I guess it can develop pretty easy when you are stuck in an identity/body/life, that simply makes you miserable.
You’re a total sweetheart! Thank you for the lovely compliments hehe! I’m so glad you’re able to be your true self too. It’s so freeing 💜
thank you! ive known for a little over a year and came out in may. im still early in my journey but i have the same experience. i would ""want"" to hunt or go shooting or fishing. i enjoy fishing but not the other stuff. i went shooting with an uncle and chopped firewood and all sorts of ""manly"" stuff. i went shopping and got a nice suit and tie 2 years ago. im the type of person that doesnt want to make people mad or disappointed. so i have a suit and tie never worn in my closet. it didnt feel like ""me"". i would feel embarrassed for wanting to be in a dress or be the pink power ranger for halloween. then i found out about trans people (i grew up in a super conservative christian house so never was told about this) and it felt right. but anytime i mentioned lgbt i was treated like it was a crime. so i hid it and didnt even think more about it until 2019. sorry for the long story but i appreciate you saying this. it means a lot.
FWIW one of the reasons why I never post ""do I pass"" posts is because I know that I don't. I'm betting I'm not alone. So this sub probably isn't really representative of what most trans people look like. Just saying.
Exactly! My sister and I are both transgender and I can’t begin to say how much of an inspiration she is to me and how much I love her for never being afraid to be happy and getting through all the hard shit life has thrown our way. It is such an honour to be able to share my old life with her and see her embracing and loving and finding freedom in all the things I felt trapped in. Hand me down clothes take on much more of a sense of pride for me when I see her showing off happy in an outfit she’s made with my old clothes + makeup tips. I hope she doesn’t mind me sharing (even though this is more or less anonymous) but this post sums up exactly how I feel and I couldn’t wish for a better sibling 💕Sorry for gushing I guess being on this sub makes me feel so happy and sentimental seeing all the support and love .. have a great day everyone you got me tearing up at work god damn!!
yo imma cry like i didn't know i needed that in my life
OMG, yes.  Trans men are SUCH real men!
go you for coming out!

i also grew up in a christian house in a tiny town (my parents think the town is going to shit because a few asians moved in 💁‍♀️) and i moved out for college and thought the fine line of androgyny was it. then i went to visit, got suffocated by gender roles, and yeeted that little ♀️ right the fuck out. 

tell your story! be the pink power ranger! wear all the dresses in every shade and style! being yourself isn't a crime or a mistake. and post pictures of it if you're about that life! it's so awesome seeing genuinely happy moments in people's lives 🥰🥰

also you could probably get that suit altered to fit your lifestyle. swap the pants for a skirt or get some heels to grab the eyes. use the tie for a punk school girl look or something
Fams I getchu and thinking you don't pass *sucks* but because of that, it's inspiring to see people putting themselves out there confident enough that they *could* pass or happy with the fact that they definitely do
You ever noticed that the people who do post those “do I pass” pictures FEEL THE EXACT SAME WAY?
i did go through a closeted punk phase and green day is still one of my fav bands so i think punk would be cool. i might have pictures of the pink power ranger thing but i also might have the mask lying around somewhere lmao. i grew up with 2 sisters so i would get them to do my nails and makeup and play it off as ""im only doing this cause i have to"" sort of thing even though i enjoyed it.
Sure, I mean, it just makes me envious and sad, but I see what you mean. I'm just saying that the pics you're likely to see on this sub are from the very prettiest users so your sample is a bit skewed.
No. I don't doubt that they're feeling insecure and want validation, but I think they know they'll probably get it. Meanwhile over here I would never make a ""Do I pass?"" post because I know I'd get crickets."	phd635	trans	217	0.99	2021-09-03 20:27:18
(FTM 21) I rarely have a reason to dress up but uh my partner had me try on some of his clothes. I’ve never felt so good! Hoping I at least kinda pass like this 💙🤍💗		"No bc in the second photo, if you told me that was a cis man, I wouldn’t question it for a second. You totally pass.
you look really great, and confidence is a big thing!! it can be kinda hard to feel confident, but dressing in a way that you really like and feel good in is so important, even if it’s not all the time. the suit is very handsome on you!!
You’re actually really good-lookin in that suit🥴. You look amazing!💖💖💖
Damn son, you handsome! 
I‘d say you do look a fair bit younger than you are, but in the other hand I have fellow students who are cis and in their mid to late twenties and look pretty similar to you. Even better if you can celebrate the twink in you. (I sure can 😇)
Looking sharp my guy.
Dude you look handsome asf. Nice tie! An emerald color tie would really bring out your eyes!
A very boyish face but I've seen more extreme on cis men, you're quite handsome.
You go, bro!
You look handsome in your suit. It helps quite a bit in making your body look masculine. You have an androgynous look to you when dressed like you are. Your mannerisms and confidence will be key to be seen as the man you want to be seen as. That being said I have seen quite a few teenage boys with your look so you can definitely pull it off. You will likely be carded if you go to a place that requires that because of your youthful look.
you pass so well like wtf,, the outfit reminds me of Gerard Way too!
You've got some young Billie Joe Armstrong vibes going on there
depends. pass as what?
Kinda reminds me of Green Day
Looking great man👍
Oh my god I might cry. Thank you so much ❤️😭
So many times this!
Thank you so much!!!!
Why thank you ❤️❤️
My friends always call me the token twink 😂 I often get told I look younger than I am but I’ve come to appreciate it. Thank you so much for the compliments ❤️❤️
Thank you so much! ❤️
Oooo thank you so much for the idea! I’ll keep it in mind
❤️
❤️❤️
My entire life is getting carded XD people still think I’m too young to buy spray paint. But seriously thank you so much for the compliments and advice on confidence
Oh my god 😳 thank you!
Holy shit he’s like- my idol?! Thank you so much oh my god
Well considering I put FTM in my text thing. Pass as a guy
You are very welcome. I was on a pride march today and am full of love I‘m willing to share! ❤️
Being a twink is a good thing just like Botw Link lol. You def look young and very handsome. It will serve you well as you get older. No calls of scary uncle and mister, just handsome young man and dude haha.
If you are asking if you pass as a cisman i would say you are not there yet"	v00eae	trans	212	0.99	2022-05-29 01:01:32
Trying on new clothes and loving it. What do you think? 🏳️‍⚧️		"you look amazing

the white one really suits you
Cutee 🥰🥰💕🥰
What do you like about the three tier dresses? I've seen that style often.
Cute ❤️
You look great
Cute!!
I never new why ladies always took so long to get ready, but the bigger my wardrobe gets, the harder it is to pick an outfit lol. also probably because I'm actually starting to like the way I look instead of hate it. You're doing great girly!
They really suit you!
U look like my mom, in a beautiful way :D
You're very pretty! And these are some cute clothes, I especially like the white one.
Thank you! 🥰
Thanks 🥰
I love ‘em! 😍 I have really broad shoulders, so dresses or skirts like that seem to kind of balance the look.
Thank you! 🙏🥰
Thanks love 🥰😘
Thank you so much honey 😘🥰
Thank you girl 🥰  I ordered many new clothing now hoping I’ll feel the same as you  :)

I started learning what goes well with my body type and more importantly accepting what I have.
Thank you 🥰😘
Ohhh, how sweet! Thank you love 💗🥰😘
Thank you, your comment makes me happy too 😘
Thanks, I've picked up a liking for off the shoulder, hope they  don't wind up at Goodwill. :( Always looks better in the ads.

Amazing. It takes time to find yourself fully, enjoy the ride 😉

I know, I know.  Worst part is when I find that perfect color and it's only available in a size 4.
I’ve been there! And even if the size fits “horizontally”, it never fits “vertically” 😀
This is something which worries me. I'm 6' and I've ordered a few dresses. I have a sneaking suspicion that they will be more revealing than I'd prefer.
My curse is short legs and a long spine. Sitting down next to someone who is taller than I; it looks as they are the short person. Really screws up where the waist sits. And inseams are a nightmare.
Short inseam biker shorts. Also good for unexpected windy days.
Then, you should always “stand up” for yourself 😛
Good advice! I've actually already been looking at some 😀

Accidentally came out to my mom yesterday night	"Today she took me shopping for men’s clothes 

Never felt more loved in my life."	"I wish my parents had done that when they accidentally found out instead of lecturing me about how I'm not trans.
Now THAT is how to be a good parent.
Congrats!!! If you don't mind me asking, how'd it happen? Either way, I'm so happy for you!
Excellent, that is how a parent should react.
This makes me so happy! I love reading about supportive parents/care takers.
Congrats, bro!! :)🏳️‍🌈
OUTSTANDING
I'm so happy for you bro! :)
Congrats. Your mom sounds nice.

My mother on the other hand is really mixed messages
Wow , gotta Love ur Mom !!! Huggz Becky
What are your preferred pronouns if you don't mind me asking?
I just made a joke about they/them pronouns, and she said she didn’t really understand me wanting to be trans. As soon as she said that I knew she knew. We had a talk and it went well, considering the circumstances.
She/her
Miss, you didn't deserve that. No one knows you better than yourself. The fact that your parents can't see how beautiful you are, and that they don't agree with who you are, shouldn't affect you. Yet I know it will.

Just know that the rest of us think you are valid as fuck. Be the girl you want to be, be the girl you are. When you get the chance, don't hesitate. Change your life to a different outcome, change it to a better outcome.
Thanks to a conversation I had with my grandmother I actually have a way of forcing my parents to accept me. My sister is also trans and actually stopped talking to the rest of the family because of it which upset my grandmother and I was told that if I were to stop talking to her too it would break her heart so I just have to present her with a solution to solve this problem and everything will hopefully resolve itself in a way that doesn't involve me not talking to my family anymore (tell her that the only way to fix it is by getting my parents to accept their kids for the women they are instead of the men they were incorrectly born as in case you couldn't figure it out).
I wish you the best. Which-ever way this goes for you, just remember how amazing you truly are."	mn6owe	trans	212	1.0	2021-04-09 01:37:17
