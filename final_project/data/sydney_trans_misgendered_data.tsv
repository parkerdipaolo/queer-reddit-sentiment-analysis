Got incredibly dysphoric today, my mother kept misgendering me. Do I pass??? 😰		"Forgot to say I’m 20 y/o and a trans woman (MTF)
Yes! 100%
Uh, I didn't know you were trans til I saw the sub, you do 100%
Pass? I thought you were cis until I saw the sub 100%
Your mother needs glasses or a correction to her prescription!
You definitely pass, sounds like she might have been trying to start shit with ya, anyways I hope you have a better day.
Your eyeliner is off the charts, pass x1000

I’m gonna be real honest I didn’t see what sub I was in and thought I was in one of my makeup subs and just thought “damn she’s really pretty!” So yes you absolutely pass
You mentioned you're a woman and I thought you were a woman from the pictures, so I think you pass! Parents are just sometimes really good at, you know, choosing to be wrong.
Beautiful 🥰🥰🥰 Ignore her ass!
Guaraná
You look like a sweet girl to me.

As a woman? Yes.

What drugs are your mother on and where can I get some
trans people always be like “feeling dysphoric 😢” while being the most passing trans person on the planet
Girl i look amazing!
You pass flawlessly.
[deleted]
I for real was like 'this is a cis woman I don't get this post' at first. GIRL you pass.
Wouldn’t have even realized you were trans until you mentioned it
Holy sheit i thought you were asking if you pass as transmasc or NB i thought you were afab 😂 yes, you pass
you pass 100%
yea, you definitely do

love your earrings in the third photo btw they're amazing
i didn't even realise you were trans until i saw the caption
You look beautiful!!💗💗💗💗
Hell yeah girl! You’re fuckin pretty and your eyeliner is so pretty I’m honestly jealous damn yeah you’re on fire and you pass like a supermodel! 💜
You hella pass omg be my girlfriend /platonic
Mana você tá linda 💞 desculpa mas sua mãe é uma idiota kk
ya pass, lass
Yeh can't see why you wouldn't.
you pass by flying colours, in my opinion! you look amazing!
Most definitely!
Incredibly!
Ngl I thought you were transmasc before I read your comment (which was shitty of me to assume sorry), so yeah I'd say you pass pretty well 😅
that right there is a whole entire female 😳 you pass 100%
100%
I thought u were cis tbh. Yes
Um, yes. Super cute hair, especially on pic2, great job on your eyes, I'd kill for your lips/mouth.

You're a girl.
you absolutely pass. if you want my advice, dont let your lower side profiles show that much bc it definitely passes, it just raises the question in the first place
Literally thought you were cis until I seen the sub!! Sounds like she was being shit af!!
Ya mostly, tho I can see how you will get misgendered here in israel
YES!
🙂
Pics 1 and 3, 100%. Pic 2 you'd pass flawlessly for me if it wasn't mentioned. Given she's known you a long time it wouldn't be surprising if she still claimed you don't pass even if the entire rest of the world agreed. It's easy to see what you're looking for
Looks to me like you pass so well she felt like she had to start some shit
You’re gorgeous babe. 💞 love your eyeshadow.
Sis you have an insultating amount of passing, this isn't even like, a doubt that you pass ;;
Yes 100% you're so pretty! The first pic is so artsy and cute.

You're literally my goals, starting now at 22. Stay strong:)
10/10 pass! Love your makeup <3

Wouldn’t even give it a second thought
Go on Instagram and search ""Bassrilia."" You came up first on reddit and my brain went ""OH, Bassrilia, I thought I opened reddit."" Also yes.
Didn’t register that you were trans until I saw the sub we’re in.  100%!
You do pass, you're a incredible beautiful woman.
you are beautiful 🥰🥰
Oh sweetheart you do so much more then pass! You look absolutely gorgeous!
Yeah I was like ""pass as an adult"" or something? All I see is girl with great hair.
Either man or woman you’re sooo cute!
YOU PASS SO GODDAMN HARD WOW
YOURE STUNNING
Definitely pass :D
Me: ‘sweats nervously hoping this is a lady and not transmasc’ yes, yes you do
Definitely, your mother must be delusional
Dannmm girl you look more like a woman than me (FTM still in the closet)
Absolutely super cuteness adorable.
You pass perfectly, seriously. I wouldn't say this if it wasn't 100% true.
You pass 100%! And you look incredibly cute!
Very well!!!! What’s ur secret?
Your gorgeous
I assumed you were asking if you passed as a trans man. Yeah I wouldn't have guessed in a million years that you weren't born in a female body. You're way beyond passing, don't worry!
Brinco de guaraná, achei genial..

But yes, you pass 110%, so gorgeous!
You look very beautiful
Yes, of course!
You pass so much

Yes, you kinda give me Sae-Byeok vibes from Squid Game.
Simple answer : Yes you do pass !
Heck yeah you pass. At least in my eyes. You're far prettier than me. Try to forget what she said. You're beautiful!
Easily pass
Yes :\]
honestly...you pass extremely well and also u seem like ur age!!!
U pass fine,  no worries. Probably just she being used to it
you look like one of my cis fem friends aged up.

definitely. your moms prbly doing it intentionally
You seem to be a woman, but I can’t tell if really your just a god in a woman’s garb hmmmm
You most definitely pass.
You look stunning 😍
Yeah bae♥️♥️
can you stop lookin like a pretty version of me?
#YES YOU PASS AND OH MY YOURE BEAUTIFUL
She must look like such a crazy person if she does that in public, because you look like a girl completely.
You’re so cute oml, also your eyeliner skills are on POINT
That's a 100% pass. Also is that a Guarana Antartica earring?
WOW🤩🤌💥
Of course you do! You're beautiful girl!
Also, is that a Guaraná Antártica earring? Are you brazillian?
110% you definitely pass. She's just being ignorant. I'm sorry, fren.
You are beautiful baby. It may take awhile for her to get it right. I have 2 children and I get their names mixed up sometimes
You honestly have great goals. I'd be way happy looking like you.
You pass really well!
Excuse me miss- You dropped your crown.
yes.
Look at that cute face! Pouty lips and soulful eyes! And the adorably tousled hair.

Ma’am, you look gorgeous ☺️
You look completely like a young woman. I’d say you look 18-22, so right about your age. 

I’m sorry your mother doesn’t accept you. For so many trans people, family hurts :(.
Don't know how anyone could see you as anything but a girl
Girl you fine as hek
I LIVE FOR YOUR HAIR
MAJOR PASSING
You look like one of the cool artsy girls I’d see at my college (mainly 17-19 year olds) also I love your hair
Definitely; although I’d say that you look more like a 17/18/19 year old teen.

Some people might think you’re an AFAB NB from the hair/makeup, but at least most cis-het adults I know would just see “teenage girl”.
Yeah! Tell dysphoria to shut up. You look amazing!
hhgngngn you’re so pretty????? im so jealous???????
you pass very well!
Yes you do 😎😎😎
You definitely pass! Also your makeup is really really cool!!!
GIRL UR MAKEUP IS SO PRETTY. Pls give me tips 😭😭😭💕💕
Omg you're so pretty! Of course you pass! Head up, chump, you'll make it!
Totally. And you look great.
woah, yeah u do!

parents misgender trans children all the time, regardless of wether or not we pass.
You are so cute
[removed]
[deleted]
Nah
I doubt it. She has seen your duck right?
Your mom is being very unkind and I think you look cute!!
If you’re transmasculine, I’ve got some very bad news for you…(lol j/k)

I seriously didn’t even realize this was the trans sub until I read the title. I’m struggling to understand how your mom can misgender you without feeling stupid/confused.
First off you look amazing!

Second, and I say this to share some experience, I would give your mother a little bit of a break. I know it hurts when she messes up but she is so used to calling you by something else, she replies more on memory then visual. 

My mother misgenders and uses my old name all the time and I don't hate her for a second for it. I know she is trying and it's a honest slipup that has been reducing over time on its own. I even tell everyone that I expect mess ups and if they do to just keep moving the conversation and not to worry. 

If your mom is working with you, then don't worry about the misgendering. If she is doing it purposely to spite you, that's a bit different.

At the end of the day people are people and if their intent is good, give them some breather, they are new to this stuff aswell. 

Just saying in good faith and spreading the love.
You are 1000% all your own agency and that’s mostly what matters. However, the cis het patriarchy has other ideas…… ✨🙏🏼🏳️‍⚧️🔥💫💞🥰❤️‍🔥🦄 stand in your power 🔭🔮💊🦠🛠🔥🌑🌎
ur mom needs glasses 🤨 
























*psst that eyeliner is godly*
Yeah you pass, your mom's just being a dick.
Btw I love the earing ♡ pass a good day (and good luck with your mom :/)
Yes you pass and are very pretty.  If your mom knows, I couldn't understand why she would since you look like who you are.  But parents are parents bleh
I’m so sorry she’s treating you like that. And YES! (That’s not the most important thing but yes, you do) actually you look so much like a friend of mine 🖤🖤✨ like sooo much, she’s cis. although i don’t think cis ppl should be the “top” reference. Trans is beautiful💖
No, you look like a little girl
you pass incredibly well actually, I think your mom is just butthurt her daughter's prettier than her </3
I want to start by saying you look cute in all these pics, and your makeup is really good! I personally think you pass better in the pics where you have more natural colored lipstick (pink/reddish) than the pic with the dark purple lipstick. Sorry your mom is being a dick, it does get better.
When mom's misgender, it almost never has to do with how well you pass.  It has to do with her not letting go of her ideas of who you are and who you would be that she's been building since before you were even born.  Giving her time to grieve that made up person, then time to get to know you, and then her eventually waking up to the fact that she didn't lose you at all and that she finally gets to experience all of you genuinely is the only path to her accepting you as you.  No amount of unclockable gender expression will substitute for that work.  The hard part is that not all mom's are willing to do that work, so you have be strong enough and wise enough to put up the right boundaries when necessary for your own protection and give leniance when doing so isn't abusive to your self.
Omg you look like that one girl from the evelyn wetoon😍
pass 3000
100% thought you were cis lol - you look ridiculously stunning! your mom is rude for misgendering you :/
You pass, and don't worry about your Mom, brains like to follow familiar pathways, sometimes the wrong words come out
Yes yes yes yes and yes + you are super hot
(SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT SUPER HOT Lmao)
yes you pass super duper well I'd kill to be as pretty as you, boys literally just call me slurs if I flirt bc I'm so ugly
Oh my god I was genuinely confused and didn’t want to say the wrong thing but fuck 100% PASS your mom is blind 

Your features are very femme and you look super cute :)
You pass girl dont worry, also Yesss another Goth Trans-girl \^\^
You are beautiful! Don't lose confidence in how you look, and that makeup is amazing!
U re so cure♡
You look like a cis woman. Or are you enby?
You pass hundo percent fam
Yes you pass
You look to be late teens 18-19 ish, and your mother really misgendered you? I know cis girls that don’t look as much like a woman than you
holy shit i thought you were like 15
I legit thought you were a pre-transition transmasc, so... I'd say so. Lol
oh dang sorry that wasn’t supposed to be a reply to you lol but on that note, thank you 🥺
omg that’s like, the biggest compliment 🥰 ty! (not that my being trans is a bad thing, but for my dysphoria your comment is great ahahah)
🥺🥺 thank you so much omg
she really does 🤦🏻‍♀️ it’s the voice ig. not high enough to be super fem and not low enough to be masc. she says i ruined my body by taking HRT. she’s also a hardcore christian. all in all not a great combination :/
Not necessarily, she could just be struggling to get used to it. My mum struggled for a long time but mistakes happened less and less as time went on. I’ve now been out to her for two years, and she rarely makes mistakes. When she does she corrects herself. It’s a difficult thing for parents to get used to, and people need to stop expecting them to be instantaneously 100% accurate all the time. Parents knew you for your whole life as one thing, and then to be told your name is now X and your pronouns are Y is a massive change. They’re not bad people just because they forget, or they make a mistake. This isn’t transphobia, it’s just force of habit and trying to get used to something new, and probably a completely new concept too.

On the other hand, some parents really are bastards, and transphobic, and don’t deserve to know their child for who they really are, or at all. Telling the difference between them is rarely east, but innocent until proven guilty usually works. Set boundaries if it’s safe to do so, and correct parents. If they take it badly, I’d start figuring out an exit strategy.
makeup is my passion lol thank you for noticing 💖
yeah, i was in the process of cutting ties with her, but then a friend of hers with covid visited her house while i was there picking some old things and now we are both self-quarantined. for two whole weeks :(
i’m amab so all these comments are making me feel like the most amazing girl in the universe 💖💖💖 absolutely lifted up my spirits after that disaster of a day :D
🥺🥺🥺 thank you so much omg
my mother kept deadnaming me and calling me “he” and “son” so my dysphoria went through the roof ahahah, thank you 🥰
thank you ❤️ they are from a brazilian soft drink :P i love wearing quirky things like these
OMG i was thinking about posting in a makeup sub in stealth mode lol, if you see my face around those and i don’t mention that i’m trans, let this be our lil secret lol 🥰
yyeah she’s fully choosing to be ignorant with me. luckily i’ll be back in my own home by next saturday (quarantining with your transphobic mother SUUUCKS)
r/ithadtobebrazil
aww thank you!!! ❤️
that’s so reaffirming 💖💖💖 thank you!
i’m 6 years in so all i have to say is don’t give up! sometimes dysphoria will creep up on you (like it did for me) but keep you head held high and keep going ❤️
aaaa omg thank you!!! makeup is one of my passions <3
you all saying that you thought i was cis is just 💖💖💖 thank you so much!
yes i’m girl 🥺 i hope my mother can see that someday
aaaahhh you’re making me blush!!! thank you ☺️☺️
i cut it myself 😅 i’m way too afraid of going to do my hair at a hairdresser and be given a “male” cut when they hear my voice (it’s like high enough so it’s not “man” but low enough so it’s not “woman” either). so i just cut it with notmal scissors and my partner helping me with the back :D
am i graduated from the trans school? 🥲🥲🥲 lol
yeah i think a little biased there XD but honestly, thank you ❤️❤️❤️
The sad reality of having a transphobic environment
Omg im so sorry girl i put i instead of you but honestly your soooo pretty!
😳😳😳 omg that’s a first aaaaa i don’t even know how to react to this XD 💖💖💖
🥺🥺 thank you so much!
i wish lol, thank you XD
hehe, they are a brazilian soft drink. i like wearing random pieces like that :D
LOL if briar (my nb partner) lets us, i don’t see why not XD (bonks myself go to horny jail)
eu AMO que os br veem o guaraná antártica  no meu brinco e ficam tipo “meu radar br está apitando” HAHAHAHH mas mt mt mt obrigada 🥰
ngl i read this in brynjolf’s voice from skyrim, he’s the one always calling me lass and i have a HUGE videogame crush on him XD
for my mother is “he” and deadname. i think she thinks it’s just a (6 year long……) phase
💖💖💖 no offense taken ;u;
awwwhh thank you!!! ❤️ i rly needed to hear (read?) this :’D
it’s kinda greyish too on the laterals right? i ALWAYS notice those things but my partner (NB) says it’s fine and i’m overreacting and i go like 🥴🥴 welp okay sure lol
in israel? can you explain a bit more? i’m brazilian
validation? yeah i guess i am. she made me feel really shitty so i’m like uhh, idk the english expression for this but like, resting and taking care of my wounded feelings before i have another go at talking to her. (the expression i was thinking of is “lambendo minhas feridas” which translated literally means “licking my wounds”)
🥺🥺 thank you so much!!!
i love this reaffirmation 🥰🥰🥰 thank you so so much! 💖
almond shaped eyes are the true key to androgynous features /j
thank you!!! so high maintenance but so worth it lol
yes i’m mtf XD and thank u!!
oh she definitely does it on purpose. luckily i have a safety net of friends (both cis and trans) that help me when i’m panicking over my dysphoria and an amazing partner that does whatever is in their power to help me, can’t wait for quarantine to be over so i can at least meet my partner again! (they are waiting alone in our little apartment while i quarantine with my abusive mother 🙄) EDIT: btw thank you!!! can’t believe i forgot to thank you lmao
thank you! 🥰
omg it was an instagram store that made them in biscuit. i’ll try to find the link for you :D
i found them but the store apparently moved or something, it’s giving me a 404 page. :( it was a store called lyla brincos, they have all sort of fun earrings there, but idk what happened to their page. sorry x.x
thank you ;u;
OMG LOL if i wasn’t afraid she’d go all psycho and yell at me, i totally would XD great idea!
you can do it!!! good luck sis :D
thank you!!! i rly love to experiment with metallic shades XD ❤️
uhm preferably a woman? a girl? a full-on female? 😬
that’s so flattering 🥰🥰🥰 thank you!
WHAT DO I HAVE A CIS CLONE WANDERING AROUND??? WHAAAATTT
☺️☺️☺️ thank you ❤️
🥺 thank you so much!!!
AAA ok the “pass as an adult” actually made me laugh irl XD i def don’t pass as an adult, even tho i’m 20. but yea thank you ☺️🥰
woman. it’s woman. hopefully.
thank you so so much!!! 💖💖💖
AHAHAHHAHAHAH this made me laugh irl XD yeah i’m mtf :D and thank you ❤️ being called a lady is wonderful for taking care of my dysphoria, no joke
thank you!!!
a good skincare routine? 😳😳 also the hoodie i’m wearing in the first pic helps a bit with dysphoria.
um guaraná pros br interagirem tbm KKKKKK mt obrigada 💖
thank you!!! 🥰
actually, since i live in south america the seasons are switched, it’s summer here. but i got the spirit, don’t worry! ☺️
AAHHAHAHHAHAH isn’t that the girl from the transfem memes though? XD
thank you!!! 🥰
hsjsgdkdhsh i don’t know how that’s possible but i’ll take the compliment! 💖 ty!
omg /// thank you!
i’m thinking of posting on a makeup sub in stealth and see if i get clocked. i’ll update you with how it went lol
the manic pixie dream girl cut! i actually do it by myself with my partner’s help and some regular (but sharp) scissors!
thank you!!! 🥰🥰🥰
omg haha i’m not that beautiful XD and i’m pretty sure you are beautiful as well :O 💖
guess she sees me without makeup and this hair and goes “he’s just a hippie boi” while i’m like *”mother… i told you *several* times i’m a woman”*… i was getting some stuff from her house to move back to mine (where my partner currently is) but then we had contact with someone with covid and we’ve been quarantined together. it’s been a week and my mental health is declining rapidly but i’ll survive x.x
😳😳😳 that’s like my fave character, my fem transition goals AND my crush omg, thank you so much!!! ❤️❤️❤️
😳😳😳 a whole new level of compliment omg, thank you 💖
SIM!!!!!! 🤣🤣🤣
yes. and yes. :D
whoa, now *that’s* a compliment! thank you 🥰
welp, i have a found family that’s just a bunch of queers and weirdos and i love them to death. i don’t really speak with my mother, it’s just that unfortunately we had to quarantine together. she’s driving me absolutely crazy lol, but i’ll survive
my mom definitely can 🥲
well, 19 is not far from 20 hahah. i really need to learn how to adult. but i think it’s great to have sort of a baby face because usually we age well XD
thank you 💖
one **no** between literal hundreds of **yes**. yeah i’m not considering this one, would be awfully pessimistic of me. 🥰
wtf does my genital have to do with anything here???
uhm i think i *am* a little girl…? i’m 20 but i got a baby face because of my chubby cheeks.
I'm a trans woman :3
I think it’s because of my voice. It’s really soft ever since I started HRT but still not high enough to pass as a cis woman ig 🥲
☝
I don't really blame a lot of parents who misgender their children if they were really used to calling you one thing or the other. Especially if the transition is recent (not that we know when OP transitioned).

As long as they apologized and keep trying to do better that's what really counts.

Edit: Just want to add though that OP is beautiful and hope she feels better.
🥺🥺🥺 omg thank you so much 💖
If that is the case it may not matter how feminine and cis you appear she will just refer to you as your old male self anyway.

So don’t use her words to judge how you look.

You look fantastic btw
That sucks!!! One day she will realize you are who you are and nothing can change that.
you wanna say your voice is husky? believe me, many ppl like that 😳
And there it is! “Hardcore Christian.” Honey, I hate to break it to you, but it’s not your voice, it’s *her* bigotry. You could show up for breakfast every morning with DD breasts, your hair done up to Jesus, a gold lamé gown, six inch cfm pumps and a voice like Minnie Mouse and she’d probably still misgender you. 

Baby sister, it’s not you. It’s her. 

And you’re making fantastic progress! 🤗
struggling for 6 yrs? she should’ve at least learn my pronouns by now, no? x.x
Hey I don't personally know her mom, I was just saying from experience that it could have been what's happening. Sometimes my ma seems to use me being trans against me, she almost never uses the right pronouns, always calls me her daughter, and occasionally uses my dead name (I go by my nickname, Sam), but when she needs something all of the sudden I'm such a good son, and I've been out for 4 years, she's also outted me to several family members that I wasn't ready to be out to yet

 Sorry if I was being too accusatory, thank you for an alternative perspective, and have a wonderful day
Ugh that sucks :(
On the last pic your eyeliner is purrrrrfect🔥
I'm just starting out in my journey, I'd honestly love makeup skills like that😍
Ofc! :)
Indeed you are!  


(Sorry for the late reply, am coward at replying)
couldn’t agree more. can’t wait until self-quarantining is over (my mother had contact with someone with the plague so, even though she tested negative, we have to quarantine) so i can go back to my pet rats and my own apartment with my partner x.x i rly miss them
no ur right, you look amazing as well!!! 💖
i know, i'm brazilian, i could recognize that bottle of guaraná a mile away hahaha
omg! i have 3000 hours in skyrim from basically dunking my entire life into playing as a girl after giving up on being a guy by locking myself in a bedroom for 3 years. it helped me recognize my dysphoria for what it was! <3 it's a special game.
Oh cool my uncle was in sao Paulo for a year. 
Ehh nothing really to explain hebrew has a lot of gender in it and pepole here would guess male usually because of how hebrew is structured. (Bqsicly male is kind of the neutral tone which is patriarchal as fuck)
You’re welcome!
I meant it from the bottom of my heart! It's soul-crushingly awful when you don't have the support of family members. 

You are being your authentic self in the midst of that struggle, and you are pulling it off, queen! It's so encouraging. I sincerely hope your mother will love, accept, and respect you one day.
Ok thanks you definitely pass then I just wanted to make sure
Love the earrings btw
Yes, and she shredz.
Of course
Yes you are baby! A gorgeous woman 💄😚💋
Ok thanks!
<33
She was a cis character originally, gets used for a lot of different stuff now lol.
YOURE SO PRETTYYYYYYY
Awesome idea! I think it'll go well, good luck :)
Alright, thanks!
😘😘😘
OMG I love your style 😍
esse certamente é um momento r/suddenlycaralho,
é bom ver pessoas trans br no reddit :D
No offence but your mum is crazy
[removed]
I don't even know anymore
Whatever you say, girl
You pass flawlessly. Congrats! Mobile task force task successfully completed \*bzzz\*
Meh, just carry around a pack of cloves and always have one ready to pop in your mouth like you’re about to light it. I grew up around plenty of cis goth girls with voices that made mine sound positively bubbly by comparison. /s 

Just some humor to hopefully lighten your day. My voice drives me nuts too. You look lovely, never let anyone tell you you’re not.
Oh my GOD this is how I feel whenever I open my mouth I immediately get misgendered, it's rough but we'll make it to the other side. You definately pass visually btw way better than me xD
Thank you 💖 but this is on purpose unfortunately. I have 6 full years of transition already :(
Yeah, Ik someone who has been out and trying to transition for 4 years, and their parents still deadname and misgender them
😭😭 thank you! can’t wait til quarantine’s over. she only puts me down for not having a job (while quarantined……..) and gives me all the chores while she leans on her recliner on her hoarder mess of a living room smoking marijuana while also misgendering me. i am about to explode lol. but i’ll survive!
it is a lil bit x.x you know the guy who sings “let her go”? that’s my voice, only a bit raspier
6 months is probably a healthy timeline to expect for this, not 6 years.  It's time to put up some boundaries.  Be vocal about it and explain to her why you're doing it.  Put the work of learning to accept you back on her.
tbh i just watched beauty gurus a lot on youtube when i was early in my transition. especially michelle phan since she’s asian and i have almond eyes 🥰
Aw your to sweet:) but i really love how you did your make up i wanna try something similar for mee
i made myself as a girl in every game too XD my main in elder scrolls online is a female dark elf, and in skyrim i usually play as a nord because wuuthrad is overpowered XD but i think my fave out of all is mass effect. my character was just like me and it was so wonderful to see myself in that form when i was still pre-transition. Gabriella Shepard at your disposal XD
oh dang D: portuguese is also patriarchal af, we have gender pronouns and the default for a mixed group of boys and girls is masculine as well. doesn’t exactly trigger dysphoria when i’m in a group but if i’m alone and you call me “he” you can bet i’ll have a full-blown anxiety attack x_x
always good to make sure :D
eheheh they’re funny, i love them. are you brazilian as well?
dang i’ll have to check out her music later. wtf she’s almost my doppelgänger, i just think her chin and lower face are a little lower than mine, otherwise we’d be like identical twins 😳😳
i see her a lot on r/traa. she’s a trans icon in my eyes lol
hahahh se for postar lá bota um ronaldo fenômeno por mim ;P
so saying i don’t pass as a woman is somehow a jerk? how?
that’s honestly creepy. please leave my thread alone
lol alrighty
MTF Eta-9 (begone thoth) reporting for duty! (lol i loooove SCP)
thank you 💖 i’m transitioning since adolescence (i got blockers) and now with HRT for the past four years, my voice is soft but just… not enough x.x i sound like a rly gay dude. but in appearance terms, i was super self conscious after my mother pointed my boobs, my clothes, my hair, my everything and insisting that i am her “son”. it’s driving me nuts x.x
I haven't transitioned yet, but ngl if someone does that to me when I do, and if ignoring them when they do isn't effective, I'm just gonna pick a new name and pronouns to call them so I can misgender/misname them back.
ayoooo me irl
Yeah that would drive anyone crazy. You can endure this sis! And will get out and show the world the beautiful woman you are
She sounds like such a model role model for the next generation 😑 Regardless of her *opinion* , it's wrong 😊 you're beautiful!
okay, yeah i get why you can feel dysphoric about it. if it bugs you too much i do recommend voice training. Admittedly i have been to lazy to start it myself XD. But i myself like my voice i only hate ppl gendering me wrong cause of it.
Still i stand by my point. A girl with a voice like that? 😳 Hot, in my opinion.
no, not 6 months. 6 years.
I m so used to it that like I almost expect it. 

Then again I m stick qt home because of terible mental health so maybe the two are related
Nah I’m British but they still look cute af
Yeah, you two are like the same brand of cute, and you have similar makeup styles. The biggest takeaway is that you pass so well that I did a double take and thought you were my... Instagram unrealistic transition goals...

Oh yes I heard you.  That's why I'm saying those boundaries need to be put up asap, unless you feel ready to just move on for good.  That's really hard with a parent, cause they die, and then you're left with that hole too.  But I feel like six years is enough time where you break off and if they come to you later from a place of understanding, give them a chance while protecting yourself.
oh, so you’re a troll. hard pass (no pun intended)
Personally, I'm 37 and barely starting to move forward with my transition, so I figure anyone who finds acceptance quicker than 37 years beat my shameful record.  But I don't need to be sitting next to them the whole time they're figuring that out if doing so harms me.

well, you are not from this  sub. do you know what gender dysphoria is?

Dunno how I look this cute but still get misgendered		"Love those jeans
You look really cute! ❤️

Also I see a Pokémon tattoo, you excited for scarlet/violet?
Maybe cause you pants have pockets lol
Some people are just that stupid. Anyone that stupid is, frankly, not worth the time of day.

Definitely cute, girl! 🥰🥰💕💕
So cute! Ignore those lame peeps. They be doing that intentionally when you be looking that ***CUTE.***
I'm pretty sure I get misgendered due to my voice.
You are so cute! If you want a small bit of advice, shaping your brows a little and some light eye makeup would add a lot of feminine structure to your face 😊 But if you don't want to do that, don't worry because you are beautiful anyway!
In my experience it’s because cisgender people just don’t care about our sanity
One word: Republicans. (Also yes, you are cute you don’t deserve that shit)
Urgh you made think of something that happened. I worked at a pharmacy and I had a prescription ready for someone (I didn't see who dropped it off) so I called out their name. ""Michael!"" and then a trans lady came up to the counter and red-faced paid for her prescription. I feel so bad for not asking her if she had a name I could put on file as ""preferred"", since we need the legal name for insurance purposes (and I assume she hadn't legally changed her name to her chosen name yet).

I am becoming more aware of these things as I get older so hopefully if I'm in a similar position again I can respond with more empathy :)
Wish I was that cute 😆
You are very cute
Look good
You look very cute, hope you don't mind my saying so
Where did you find those gorgeous jeans 🥺
I get this i get called maam at work while having a visible stache! You look super cute btw!! :)
Cute yes, but c’mon..
What gender are you trying to look like?
>Dunno how I look this cute but still get misgendered


Literally me everyday all the time
I’m not trying to be mean as a straight male at all but being misgendered lays in disrespectful peoples hands. Sure everyone knows what you’re going for but not all respect it. Love the hat!
I only mean this in a supportive way, maybe it's because despite ""cuting"" up your outfit is a bit tomboyish? I find the look a bit androgynous, anyway. Maybe they think you're the opposite transition?

Or they're jerks, which is unfortunately highly likely. Try not to worry about what inconsequential people think about you (including my own comments, if they cause you any distress) and ficus on your own happiness and the opinions of people who really matter to you.

“Just a small town girl, living in a lonely world” 🎵
Are those princess highway jeans? I’ve been eyeing them for a while they look so good on you!!
Girlllll you are giving it,  you pass all day!!!
love the jeans! where did you buy them? (also live the pokeball tattoo)
because people suck. you look really cute though!!!
How?! You look amazing
Don’t worry, you look adorable
Needs moar tats

Become *that girl with the badass sleeve*
Don't know how either! You're looking cute af
HOW?! Also, I live laugh love your hair.  And all in all your style is just *chefs kiss*. Superb. Keep looking great 👍👍
They're just being asshats
So cute! AND THE POKEMON TATTOOOOOO
That is the eternal question...
It's gotta be jealousy. They know how cute you are, and they hate it. Which only means you're doing something right!
Well, i would say you look like a cutie but idk if that’s the right gender
You get misgendered because people are stupid. Loving that outfit on you!
[removed]
Yeah I dunno either!! How??
Cis people don't care how well you express, ""pass"", or communicate your actual gender. If they know your agab, that's all you are to them.
I get misgendered while wearing a mask that says she/her in big bold letters. People just be dumb.
I don't know what their problem is. (Well, I have some suspicions but...)  You look cute AF! Keep it up, stay safe, and living your best life is the best revenge against the haters. It's Sunday morning, so go have a nice Brunch. Get the best table while all the cishets are in church! You can be 2 mimosas in before they even get to Communion! lol!
Im in love with the jeans. Sorry for having to deal with that kind of people. Send you lots of love.
Your outfit is *chef’s kiss* 🤌
OMG I actually thought that you were FTM, you have very feminine features.
Which gender I have a hard time identifying it idk why
You look really amazing! You go comrade!
I feel like people go out of their way to misgender people. It's so dumb.
Unfortunately it's probably unlucky genetics with a very masculine jaw line, if you were wearing even slightly bagger clothing and seen from the side it would be mistaken as such by a large majority of people. I suffer from the same aspect, and when I smile it's five times worse.
u/ItsCoolDani generally Aussies are fuckwits and way behind in the times, spend the day in newtown today so that was nice, its like a whole different planet from the usual bigotry im used to
Because people be blind. Love the pokemon that by the way.
I'm not sure, the most masculine thing about you is your face but even then that's a massive stretch as you do look like a woman.
[removed]
Well, I see man features but woman as well. Its hard to tell ...can't go by clothing for sure. Some days I Iook like a lady, some days I look like a man, some days I look beast! 🤣

Same. I got out in leggings, an over the shoulder shirt, that shows bra strap clear as day. Choker, mecklaces, purse, whole 9 yards. Still ""sir"". Next MFer to misgender me this month, im SCREAMING "" Ma'am"" at them.

I commented on my backup account, omg 😂
You’re absolutely stunning! 

People who misgender often do it on purpose just to be an asshole. Don’t listen to that, cause you are amazing and don’t need assholes in your life.
My cis male husband gets misgendered all the time... he has a full beard and mustache, and long hair. I think many people are honestly just stupid, or it's on purpose.
Same this happens to me alot when i forget to consciously raise my voice to talk.
Love love your jeans so cute
I think it's more due to culture. I had a friend go to the doctor while they were in Italy and they used the proper pronouns first go.
Human stupidity can't be overestimated
its cause youre too powerful for their likes
Cuz some people are just literally walking bags of shit. Sorta like oogie boogie. You're gorgeous though
I can see that
Thankyou! I got drunk and went shopping and I definitely couldnt afford them haha.
Thankyou! Yea actually, first one I've been excited about in a while!
Trueee and they're deep big boy pockets too. It's the only explanation
[removed]
Happened to me in a taxi yesterday. Was dressed hella femme and the driver said ""Thanks, brother"" after I paid. 

Grrrr...
True story. No matter how much I don't look male, how much effort I put into my look, how long I spend on my makeup and hair.....inevitably my voice always betrays me. 

Stupid voice.
Yea I'm pretty sure that's what it was. Was asking for a drink at the bar and the bartender had to check with his boss who was just walking past not really looking, and said ""sure thing, get him a drink"".
Thanks! I'm really not into makeup or eyebrow stuff at the moment, otherwise I probably would, but I appreciate the advice!
[removed]
ah yes, because the only people who intentionally misgender ever are conservative americans. because there are no liberal/centrist terfs and transphobes or anyone who lives outside of the US ever.
Ya now were Trans Terrorists according to some of them….
Can y’all call last names?
An Australian shop called Dangerfield! They have so much cute (and relatively expensive haha) stuff! Got the beanie there too!
Thankyou!! It's so funny to me how other people perceive gender.

Yes!! Exactly the ones. So good. My friend got the same with like strawberry embroidery on them.

“Need” ffs? That’s a bold statement…
Women's faces don't have to look a certain way to look like a woman's face ^-^. If someone wishes to FFS for themselves, then more power to them, but you shouldn't have to change your face to """"look like a woman"""". And I say this as a Black person, relevant because Black cis woman are constantly told that they ""look like men"" since we generally don't have button noses nor smaller jawlines. Society just needs to recognize that women and men don't need to look a certain way. 

Also OP didn't ask for criticism.
It's funny that out of all the ""you look really cute"" affirmation in this thread, to me this is the best compliment haha.
I read a comment suggesting to shape your eyebrows and I really think that could help. But either way you still look feminine.
Oh god, your profile history was.... unhinged is putting it lightly.
Danggg u harsh
Well, I think I do and I don’t really care about passing. But thanks for trying to kill my self esteem!
Context clues, past posts/comments, etc all seem to suggest that, though I will give you that I don't see anywhere they EXPLICITLY stated it.
Context clues make it pretty clear in this case I think.
Ugh I feel that when someone calls me ma'am or miss I sigh and role my eyes everytime. Another thing that sucks is my name isn't changed but I just go by the shortened version of my name and I always tell my doctors, physical therapists, receptionist, nurse, etc. That I go by male pronouns and the shortened name and they still call me by my legal name or refer to me by female pronouns. It's super frustrating.
Well, with you banned it does kinda *feel* safer:)
there are definitely many liberal terf transphobic ppl but i think its hella more common with conservatives lol
Yes none of those people do that that’s so true, why wouldn’t I mention those people that don’t do that in a very short ironic comment on a Reddit post that is a generalization and meant to be slightly funny as a result of that generalization. /s
So, I’ve traveled and continue to travel to about 46 different states and 15 countries… and I’ll be honest… the people who tend to misgender me are cis-male conservative Americans. 

In Europe i have Muslims and many other religious types many may view as conservative… but I’m almost never misgendered in Europe. 

It’s pretty much only in the US, and by conservative men. 

Do some people make mistakes? Yes, but even then… the non conservative types fall over themselves with apologies because they actually understand it could be harmful…

Maybe I’m biased, but I do keep count. So my statistics seem to match my generalizations.
Oh we do, I probably called out her full name. This was 6 years ago.
Obviously 🙄 

Some people
Nah, I don't think so. She definitely doesn't look like multiple men. She's definitely just very pretty and people must be jealous.
I came here from /r/all. While this person does look very much like a man, I think I’d acknowledge that they are different and I would not try to offend them by misclassifying them - I understand people like this take words to heart and it could upset them. Doesn’t hurt me, doesn’t hurt them. Hello/how can I help, goodbye, etc.
Excuse me but any trans person taking hrt would disagree. There's a certain feminine or masculine look you are trying to achieve and when that doesn't happen you still experience body dismorphia no matter how you dress. I have a female body but want it to look masculine and strong. Masculine traits are a natural part of our identity and we are lucky that there are tools we can use to become more masculine (squares jaw, thinner lips, prominent cheekbones and smaller eyes) or feminine. Let's not invalidate people's need to look the way they identify.
Oh well I gave it, there is freedom of speech regardless if you like it. I was nice about it. Stop taking things so personal, good lord 🙄
Also just the cost. Kind of rude to just tell someone they need a major surgery

To be honest i think youre coping a little to much
Well said
I said if someone wants to pursue things for their own happiness, then that's fine. I'm just opposed to opposing standards onto others for how they should look :). Supportive of doing what you gotta do to help alleviate dysphoria, and against transmedicallism.
To be fair, I wouldn't say telling someone that they need plastic surgery is a nice thing to do. I appreciate your sentiment, but I'm relatively happy with how my face looks.
I'm not taking things personal nor infringing on your freedom of speech, I'm just using my speech to voice my disagreement. I'm also just pointing out that you're possibly giving someone an insecurity they didn't have before when they didn't even ask for feedback. There's a flair in this subthread for constructive criticism, and OP didn't select it
This is Reddit; there's no [*Freedom of Speech*](https://xkcd.com/1357/).

The comment above was removed because this post was flaired as \[Vent\], despite [other options being available](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/v5crxj/comment/ibbdtfs/?context=3).
I mean I love my jeans and glasses so
I wasn’t asking for that though. I think I look cute, and so do a lot of people. Perspectives can be different and it’s fine if you don’t agree. But unless someone is asking for an opinion (hint: I wasn’t), don’t give them your negativity.
Given that the post literally is talking about being gendered correctly in public (in situations where people generally don't ask), it seems pretty obvious that they are presenting to specifically be read as their gender, thus acting confused about the fairly obvious intent seems like it would be counterproductive (i.e. indicate that their attempt to be easily read as their gender is failing). Likewise, reading them correctly would likely be positive.

Additionally, their past post/comment history supports such an assumption, given talking about i.e. [feeling like a woman](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/v1qadh/is_it_too_late_to_transition_after_18/iantvxp?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3).
""i am in denial"" - your comment  


bro conservatives frequently intentionally misgender and harass LGBTQ, its not a case of us just obeying the news, its from our personal experience.
""I have never heard anyone intentionally misgender""
""big man hands""
omg your edits get more and more problematic
Mods please remove this offensive comment.
I'm glad that you've never had that happen.

I, however, was raised in the Southern US by extreme conservative Christians, and it was a very common thing that I heard constantly from my family and friends down there. They would see someone who they assumed was trans and start aggressively misgendering them. They would laugh about it later, saying that they had ""owned that lib."" No, that isn't a joke, and yes, they did say that exact fucking phrase. Family gatherings frequently involved laughing about lgbtqia+ people and how we were mentally ill. When I came out, the first thing my father said to me was ask if I was ""aware of the high suicide rates amongst <slur for trans people>."" My brother made attack helicopter jokes, and still does. 

Your experience with more ""polite"" individuals on the political Right is not universal. I wish it was, I really do. Many of us have dealt with that darker side of the party, and it fucking sucks.
>I'll show you how nice I am, assholes!
I just call it like I see it. Plus you know, it's kind of weird to call someone multiple men instead of a singular man, so I figured I should probably point that out too.
Well I agree to disagree Lol, discussion closed. 🤗
dumb fuck got it wrong anyway, im a trans man

trans rage	"i don't think we talk about this enough, if at all. it's almost like trans people aren't allowed to be angry, yet a significant part of my experience has been characterized by anger. facing transphobia has almost never made me ""sad"" in the way society likes to portray queer people to be - i am not going to cry if you misgender me, i will rip you to shreds, or at least wish i could. 

i have developed a pretty thick skin after being out for years in a still very transphobic country, honestly, but having to face the same shit over and over and over again, nearly every single day, i honestly don't have the words to describe how infuriating it is.

and at the end of the day? i'm still expected to be the one educating people and ""being patient and understanding"" if they don't get it. fuck that, and fuck you. i should not have to explain my identity to every single person that interacts with me. i should not have to put up with being misgendered and outed because ""you just can't understand the concept"". living in a cis society is so. fucking. exhausting."	"I feel the same. I don’t want people to use my anger to think that trans men are violent, as those who stand against us think our “evil testosterone” makes us bad people or something.
I definitely feel like if I get angry, people are going to tell me, “how very like a MAN of you!”
Fuck being sad, we should be full of rage.
Yes. rage has characterized my experience far more than sadness post-transition. I got sir'd by a huge group, ignored them, then they all kept shouting sir at me, trying to get my attention. My tits are so obvious, def presenting femme, and there they are just sirring their hearts out. I cursed their entire family line. Sorry / not sorry.
Feel the same way with my parents my parents are openly transphobic and I bought a dress and they both yelled at me called me spiteful and disrespectful and they took my phone luckily I was able to get it back to see this lol
I've got anger issues so its even worse when people make me feel like the stereotypical trans woman
I get pissed off but I never let em know that. I just give em the “are we really doing this right now?” Look cuz that’s all the space in my mind I’ll give em
Doesn't help that I'm autistic and have meltdowns. Thankfully I've never been around a non-accepting person when they happened
This is it my queers the post i have been searching for years. I'm an anarchist queer trans woman and i have always said i dont need to pass for no mother fucking body nor do i need to fit the status quo of what you think us trans women should be. I pass as myself and i will be respected or your ass cussed the fuck out. i have called people whiny bitches who don't like the fact i am defiantly me and will remain the woman i know i am. I don't put up with misgendering or being fetished or only like cause cis men see me as an experiment no honey bunny dummy i am a whole as experience and a beautiful one. the woman i am you can never find because you can't search for this monument.

Bless you for this real post we have needed. I love you for being you i know you are exhausted but please rest and don't let the bastards get you down. much love and shalom always.
We won't be ""allowed"" to be angry until we're considered equals. As of current, the underlying idea is still that cishets *allow* us to exist in public and *grant us* respect/basic human decency, but have the power to retract that at any point.

It's the same as with gay people, with black people, with women, and will be the same with disabled people once trans people have some basic rights established and that'll be the ""new"" big social topic - not in the sense of ""we move from one thing to the next"", but as in ""the next thing white cishet progressives decide to grant a voice"".

The idea that we're lesser is what allows them to do the tone policing - if we were the ""higher""/more socially accepted party, we'd be the one able to tone police transphobes while them not being anything but kind to us in public would lead to public outcry.

That being said, not to incite anything, but it's not like the marginalised groups i mentioned above got their rights by being peaceful and not getting in their oppressors' way, so...
I am incredibly angry all the time about this exact same shit.
You know there is a statistical tendency where ppl with lower income tend to be more social

And ppl with more money just tend to go the opposite way

Bc they have the option to not deal with ppl when they dont want to

We seem to generally avoid ppl when we have the option

Like ppl are building guarded societies and stuff to keep all those idiots out and not having to deal with them

Like we have the social value of


Everyone matters and is valuable


But it seems a lot of ppl seem to be not as striking to ppl when they have the option, and they still do fine without them


Like thats a statistical generalisation, still

I remember some rapper beeing like

""i really want to support the ppl in my old shit neighbourhood, but they just keep stealing my shit""


Same as area for me as

""Democracy assumes a informed population ""


Like we are not gonna say anything explisit

But like ppl seem st be sht
That's a pretty good observation. I can't say what the FtM experience of that would be, but as an MtF person, I definitely feel what you're saying.

It's like on the one hand women are socially conditioned not to show anger. And growing up as a closeted trans person, nevertheless I subconsciously absorbed and tried to follow a *lot* of female-coded social conditioning.

But on the other hand, testosterone. And anybody who says T doesn't shorten your fuse and put your anger on a touchier trigger, well, they don't know what the F they're talking about.

And on the third hand, the constant paradoxes that being trans subjects you to are genuinely infuriating, so there's a lot of anger to be had. As much as you want, and none of which you feel you're allowed to express. Even if you wanted to, which you probably don't, but it's there anyway.

And it's going to come out one way or the other. You can't keep it all bottled up forever. 

In this bind of having rage that I was not permitted to show, I had to let it out in private. I punched a lot of walls when nobody was around. And, here's your PSA for the day, I don't recommend it. I went through years in college where my right hand pretty much always hurt. I'm certain that I fractured and hairline cracked several bones in that hand, which never really got the chance to heal before the next wall-punch came along.

Don't be like me. Don't punch walls. I'm way older now, and I can tell you, you don't want to get to my age regretting the arthritis and chronic pain you're going to have to endure for the rest of your life in your punching hand, even though you kicked the wall-punching habit years and years ago, knowing that it's your own damn fault for doing that damage in the first place.

But if you're here reading this, you're already ahead of that game. The rage didn't start to go away until I figured out I'm trans and could start processing these feelings in an accurate context for once. If you're here then you know you're trans, so you can go down a better path than I did.
YES. The one that super gets me is that sometimes the CIS will come and comment or post in a queer space like this and if anyone says ANYTHING other than ""ooohhh poor baby! Let me teach you you perfect star child, thank you for just being here!"" Then it's the queer folk who get dogpiled for not coddling. I'm all for education and for not being cruel, but holy shit sometimes people need to be told that they just need to do better and that anger doesn't seem to be allowed.

Here’s an essay about Trans rage I think y’all might communicate with, if meant a lot to me
I like this energy of yours, which I share myself. Being a femme trans girl, is not going to stop me from cursing the sh\*t out of myself, if I come across a degenerate bigot.
I get what you mean. Then we are told ""just go somewhere more accepting"". Like do they realize that they are defending bigotry? I hate society
I just get cold and calculating anymore.  I don't get sad or mad, I think ""what's the quickest way to get me away from this person that would cause the least drama?""  They don't deserve my anger or sadness.  I just want them to leave me alone.
I have spent so much time being angry (or in fight or flight) since coming out. I discovered my family members, who said they would support me no matter what are actually incredibly transphobic/homophobic, and I’m afraid of being a hate crime stat. anytime I am out in public when I dress or present how I feel most comfortable and my authentic self. I am tired of it. I hear you, and I’m so sorry. I am of the mindset that rage is part of the “experience”. It helps me remember there’s something we’re fighting for, and that the world is changing. It gets exhausting not yelling at or swinging at transphobic people, though.
This is true words. I haven't been trans long but the entire time its been nothing but anger.
I completely agree. Dealing with ignorance and bigoted people on a daily basis is so tiring and it makes me so annoying, angry and disappointed. I hate it so much, but I can’t do anything because no one likes to take trans people (and queer people in general) seriously.
My least favourite thing of all is when you express the anger/frustration and Cis friends say something along the lines of “nobody’s going to listen if you’re angry” - if your being an ally has conditions, then you’re not an ally. I am not about to reject the identity that society assigned me against my will only to “fit” into THEIR comfortable narrative of what a “good trans” is. 

This is MY life, MY existence, MY experience, and I’m not about to abandon my identity that I worked so hard to be able to have in order to appeal for a superficial “ally” if you’re an ally you’re an ally, no strings attached, no conditions, no expectations for us to adhere someone else’s narrative.
I think our brutal and unrelenting rage needs to be shown. I mean I've literally used Commander Erwin's charge speech when expressing my rage and talking with other trans folk.
while education is important, NO ONE should be *expected* to educate people and feel like they need to justify their existance to people, and that they need to be patient and understand. fuck that. 

personally, sometimes I feel like I'm in a good enough place to try and help people understand, and sometimes its too much for me to even try when I feel like I'm on the verge of breaking at the seams and I want to just be myself. My experience has been largely sadness but a good ammount of anger too. dunno what else to say but yeah.
There need to be safe and understanding places to just VENT OUT ALL THE FRUSTRATION WITH EVERYONE AROUND YOU.

Be patient and understanding, everyone's patience has its limits, nobody has infinite patience and you are expecting too much from trans people. Nobody's a f\*\*\*\*\*\* saint. And when trans people get tired and overwhelmed (like normal humans) people make it a much bigger deal.

This honestly also goes for sexual minorities, racial minorities, disabled people, any type of minority. There should be spaces where you're just allowed to scream and vent without being judged for it.

Or how people don't understand the difference between venting and actual hate. Sometimes you just want to scream how cis people are unbearable, but you do it after an awful interaction and you need to get it out of your system. That's not hate, that's actually necessary for a healthy mind. Vomiting the anger out of you is healthier than keeping it inside.

Mental health is stigmatized and misunderstood. Add transphobia on top of that and it's a mess. I'm really glad the trans subreddit has a ""vent"" tag because that is so very needed in this environment.
It’s unfortunately the price we have to pay for doing nothing other than be our authentic selves
I mean, those are the kind of emotions that start protests, and protests get us rights, so no complaints here.
I feel the same way makes me want to commit arson on their st**id ass
I’ve gotten pretty vengeful towards the right wingers since coming out as MTF. I never realized how hard they try to actually stop us from existing
I feel the same way. I live in the states; Texas specifically. I am misgendered every day by my own mother and some of my own friends. I infuriates me and yet I have to be patient. I am lucky enough to be in a very tolerant high school with a lot of fellow trans/queer teens. But I'm still in the southern U.S we're I can be discriminated against just be cause I want to be a girl, or because I like guys and girls. I still have to be patient, I still have to be educating, and I still have to keep a lid on my temper. Because I know that is even one trans kid blows up at a transphobic cis person than the entire trans community could be cracked down on, and it could give the GOP the ammunition they need to start hunting us down like animals.
I agree, if someone doesn't understand than whatever, how hard is it to understand I'm a person with a gender. Treat me like a person, if it confuses you that's because you're overthinking it or looking at it wrong. I don't need a whole interaction explaining why I exist.
100% agree I can’t stand it either
I completely agree, I'm non-binary and pan, I live in the Netherlands and it's not that transphobic or homophobic around me but still having to even explain that there's more then 2 genders is indeed exhausting. One of my previously friends couldn't understand aroace boyfriend - boyfriend relationships and it's so aggravating that some people don't even try to understand like it's a puzzle they can't solve but disrespecting all of us affected, we're not the ones that should educate us, people assigned to should so frig those extra math exercises and teach people about us.
I feel this so much my community is so toxic about anything around gender identity and sexualities to the point that me coming out has cause me to be unable to get a job where I live and has made life a living hell, I’m only 18 and recently decided to tell everyone who picks on my for my large breasts that I identify as male and they can leave me alone or face the consequences but now because I stood up for myself I can’t make money to fucking survive!!
I totally feel this way. Take my upvote
“have a thicker skin!” 
*does that*
“you should feel more like a normal person!”
:/
i have like almost no emotions anymore because ive learned to accept like everything to the point the only emotion i really feel is happiness and stress
Hugs!!
Exactly, and I’m not allowed to be angry or they call me a man or something of that nature. Hell, I have it so beat into my brain that if I get angry and dare show it, I feel bad because I feel like I’m not giving off feminine vibes or something. I completely agree, I’m so sick of living amongst so many cis people who expect so much out of me and us as a group of people
i am thankful that my BPD rage and trans rage haven't decided to hold hands. i fear what i would do if they did.
A great essay at least tangentially connected to this is Susan Stryker’s “My Words to Victor Frankenstein above the Village of Chamounix: Performing Transgender Rage”
When I came out to my parents as a trans man, my mom tried to blame it on period hormones. It should be socially acceptable to beat the shit out of transphobes.
One thing that really makes my blood boil is how cis people justify their tranphobia and shitty behaviour with “I don’t understand these things” AS IF it were a valid excuse, as if they couldn’t just respect someone regardless of their understanding. And then when you give them attitude, suddenly you’re the one who’s not cooperating, they go “I’m trying SO hard how dare you be so mean to me” fuck that. Parents misgendering and deadnaming their trans children because “it will take some time to get used to it” fuck that, it’s a fucking pronoun you dumbass bitch, get over it.
We always have to be the ones to have patience, understanding, stay calm, give people time to “settle” while they treat us like fucking garbage, fuck that, I’m so over it
I remember when I was still entertaining the idea of having my highly religious cishet grandparents in my life, I'd told them in 2019 and progress was incredibly incredibly slow and could be taken away in an instance; the final nail in the coffin for me was them telling me I ""can't wear a dress or be called Rae or she/her/they/themed"" at my great grandmothers funeral, apparently it was because ""there will be people who don't understand there and we don't you to be upset"" because apparently being furious at how both she and my grandfather tried to manipulate the family into ""getting along"" when one side was abusers and the other victims and being angry at being misgendered by them both constantly was me being ""sensitive""; despite all this I went in a dress like top and leggings, but found out I could've wore a dress because my Gran straight up said ""I really don't care"" about the whole situation she'd invented up for me and then tried her best to ignore for a solid two weeks. I tried one more time after that to get them on the same page, but was told (as I always seemed to be by them) that ""We're not from your generation and God said there is only men and women"" and that I should ""understand"" and ""respect"" their position in all this despite only one of us having actual mental harm from the treatment of the other.  


Anyway the long winded moral of this story is cishet people can thrive up their own arse all day and the instant we even show a slight grimace at their treatment they can jump out of their arses to bellow about how we're being rude for not ""respecting"" them; hopefully one day none of us will have to deal with their shit.
I’m reminded of Shovda, a trans Mario streamers. They are *extremely angry* when a level is pissing them off.

“I’m not good at maker anymore, but I will be good for five minutes to spite your ass. That’s what’s you’re getting (Carl), spite-fuelled fuckin’ trans rage.”
I had to stop E because of financial problems and when all the T came back, I did and still do get angry about stuff. My family are “supportive” but think I need to see a “real” doctor about my emotions.
""If you don't believe it or don't get it, I don't have the time to try to convince you, sorry."" — Satoshi Nakamoto
These transphobes are a bunch of whiny bitches who cry at the notion that someone has pronouns. It's time to grow the fuck up and stop digging your nose into how someone else lives their life. They need to live as they preach and stop getting offended over my existence, you don't see me obsessing over what the fuck is in your pants.
Wait, who says we can't be mad. Im mad all the time. Anger is one of the only feeling i have left!
Whoa, this is SUPER topical! Just this morning I heard a [story on NPR](https://www.wesa.fm/arts-sports-culture/2022-05-09/scholar-says-many-trans-people-are-discouraged-from-publicly-expressing-a-full-range-of-emotions) about a Sal Malatino's new book *Side Affects: On Being Trans and Feeling Bad*. From the story:

>But like anyone else, trans people experience a range of emotions, including negative feelings from fatigue and anger to envy and burnout. It’s just that, as Malatino argues in a new book, most are discouraged from expressing them publicly.
I'm usually okay with questions but have 'Im not a tutorial' days
I just want to be happy I want to get gender affirming surgeries yet I have to go through a shit ton of things to be happy it's seriously not fair
Exactly. Every time I get misgendered the people who know it look at me like ""oh nooo, Im so sorry for u"" 
No. Fuck that. I'm not about to cry, I'm about to make them cry.

The only simple thing people need to understand about trans people is that we are human beings. What do human beings need? To take your rights/genders/kids away? No. We just fucking want respect. If someone doesn't respect me, Im gonna get angry. I hate people that say shit like ""if you want me to respect you you have to earn it"" like fuck no. Respect is a human right you absolute fuck. Admiration is earned. 
I am angry, I am mad, and I am very, very upset.
FtM (23) and still not on hormones yet. This was a year ago when I finally started learning how to be assertive and advocate for myself. I don't remember what exactly I said, but I stood my ground against my mom and her reaction was to ask me if I had started taking testosterone without telling her. Like for starters, it's none of her f*cking business. And no, as it turns out I'm perfecting capable of metaphorically growing a pair without the help of hormones. 
But yeah, not even anger or agression. Just an ounce of assertiveness and people want to start demonizing trans people and hrt.
cis ally here to tell you that you're just as human as everyone else, and I don't expect you to hide your emotions. i hope i didn't say anything offensive.
Can the revolution start already?
Here's what one African-American writer said about the burden of ""explaining"" racism to white people.  By no means am I equating racism and transphobia; nevertheless, I think the sentiment applies to trans people, too.

>Day after day, year after year, one swallows the   
taste of bile over seemingly minor incidents that cannot be discussed   
lest one be regarded as rude. Then suddenly there is a need to talk, to   
know how one feels and have things explained? No can do.

https://www.washingtonpost.com/outlook/2020/06/08/black-friends-educate-racism/
this really hits home bc like fr? and there aren’t any gsa at my school or anything so i gotta stay quietly angry while being misgendered and having intense dysphoria
Wanna create a country called The Kingdom of Trans? Cause same
Black Dresses, if you want some banger trans rage
I had an experience with someone I was going to work with that wanted to make sure I wouldn’t get super angry and defensive if being misgendered. Like what?  You cannot police my emotions! And do cis people not understand that the anger comes from PAIN!? Pain from dysphoria, a strict gender roled society, transphobia, etc. so of course I’ll emote! I was so shocked.
Me too, I'm stealth in my every day life but I'm so outspokenly trans online and angry. I feel like my strength all these years come from hatred and anger. I hate most cis people I interact with because they have no clue what it's like, and if they guess that I'm trans or knew that I am they're always ignorant and inconsiderate. My ex that I was with for three years would constantly bring up sex even though he knew it made me uncomfortable. Tried to justify it because he's horny 🥴 and he hasn't had sex blah blah blah, I'm poly for a reason I don't want to do anything until I'm fully transitioned and in debt. It's so aggravating to simply exist sometimes.
I read somewhere once, when I started to recognize my anger, that being angry was a good thing because it meant that I expected better. It's so much easier to wrap my head around being angry at a specific person, making amends or finding closure with one person seems relatively attainable. Being angry at transphobia on the whole is so much harder.

I don't want to ""pass"", I've never felt joy in ""passing"". But 2 years into my transition, I recognize that it makes it a little more bearable to live in tiny ways. I hate that it gives me the privilege of invisibility.

A lot of the things I want to see for trans people everywhere may not come in my lifetime. I don't know what to do with my rage on the days when I've already done all that I can to explain or argue or fight.
It's the ""expected to be patient and understanding"" bit that pisses me off the most. 

It makes me so angry because I could literally show the TINIEST SHRED of very mild annoyance about, say, a parent continually misgendering me and suddenly every person under the fucking sun has to tell me to show them grace and kindness and support. Like I FUCKING AM YOU DICKHEAD. God forbid I complain just a TINY BIT outside of ear shot from my parents anyway!!! 

You get so much shit for expecting the basic human respect all cis people get handed automically. It's ridiculous. I don't even show outward anger but I sure as fuck feel it a lot of the time. I hate it because I DO show UNBELIEVABLE patience and understanding to people who 100% do not deserve it but the second I step a tiny bit out of line it's ""why are you so angry!! They're TRYING!!!"" fuck off. Seriously, fuck off. I'm so sick of it.
""Have you ever thought about how YOUR transition would make US feel?""

First of all, mum, do you really think I haven't thought about it? Do you really see me as such a selfish person that I wouldn't even CONSIDER your point of view? I have kept in mind the consequences of my identity for way longer than you could ever imagine. The fact that I decided to take action and actually do something should make you proud of how BRAVE I am, not make you think that I do it to piss you off.

And, secondly, I shouldn't. I shouldn't have to think of your pain about this because you shouldn't EVEN feel it. You shouldn't see me as ""your lost daughter"", or as the source of your suffering, because I am not causing it to you. I haven't done a single thing to hurt you, I have just been myself and I am so, SO TIRED of having to justify it.
Cis people: misgenders, berates, in some cases, physically engages us, pass laws to keep us down, and generally are dicks to us

Us: hey you're kind of an asshole

Cis people: Woah there, calm down, don't attack me you violent [slur]. It's obviously all that testosterone in your system
I called out my friend, pissed but not sad, when he said some really inappropriate transphobic things as a joke (I don't fault him, he genuinely didn't understand the significance of what he was saying and I've since helped him to understand) and instead of acknowledging that what he did was wrong or that my feelings were valid he just kinda awkwardly was like ""it's okay if you don't wanna be friends anymore"". Which idk how to explain it but that was him avoiding the topic, not acknowledging it
This anger has only been building since I came out to myself and a few friends. And now I’m like, fuck this I’m going to start E even if only out of spite alone.

And then I go introvert mode and can’t assert myself for shit. Just ahhhhhh.
UGH I feel this. With stuff like having to be Google for people, I try to approach it all with grace and be like ""well, public education fails to teach this stuff, I'll give this person benefit of the doubt and appreciate their asking"" but it definitely uses mental energy especially since I know that if I did blow up, all of a sudden this person's singular interaction with a trans person is a negative one.

For me the worst holding back is getting misgendered and wanting to correct people. That ""it's maam"" video always pops up in my brain and stops me from speaking up, even if the person isn't trying to be mean.

It's hard to explain the feeling of being misgendered, because --at least for me-- it's not quite sad or angry or anything. Mostly it's exhaustion. ""what more do I have to do??""
One book that did this really well was Dreadnought by April Daniels. The main character, Danielle, is an angry person. Not in that she's constantly violent, or wrathful, but in that there's this constant, pervasive feeling of anger that just seems to simmer under her skin. She's sick and tired of everyone else's bullshit, and when the opportunity to be herself comes along, she takes it for all it's worth and basically dares everyone else to come and take it from her.
Yeah, we are treated like second class citizens but have no outlets to express the rage. The result is just going around feeling terrible all the time. I honestly don't know what to do about this. Sending strongly worded tweets feels inadequate, and we don't really have a militant organization. We only have underfunded non-profits that don't take a hard line against transphobia.
There's a huge stigma towards many groups of marginalized people, that they aren't allowed to be outspoken, aren't allowed to be angry, etc. and if they are, they're heavily looked down upon

It's the condescension of the majority
i think of myself as a trans person who's full of roiling rage. Im full of vicious, searing anger and fury for myself and for my trans siblings. Calling out transphobes aint enough i want them dead. I want them to suffer. I want transphobes to feel the pain they cause us ten times over. I want them to beg and plead for their miserable lives at the feet of every murdered trans person. I see stories of trans women being murdered and i want the killers to suffer the most agonizing of deaths and to experience what they give out. I want to tear down transphobic and hateful laws and all the other bullshit that society enforces to try and eradicate us. I want transphobes to see me and feel fear, i want them to know if they dare try and do anything to me that i will fucking break their bones for their choice of being transphobic. I want conservative/hateful right wing people to be intimidated by me. I want to protect and defend all trans people with the righteous fury of the gods. I wanna be that obviously queer guy at pride whose presence comforts the marginalized, and scares the bigots off from trying anything hateful. And i wanna have the physical strength and weaponry to defend anyone who needs it. I want to utterly destroy the colonizer transphobic society that would gladly see us all dead. I want to raze it to shreds and eradicate it and make a better world for everyone.
Don't forget the ""it's MA'AM!!"" jokes you fucking hear every single time you stand up for yourself.

Fucking disgusting.
Fuck yes. Fight.
You can't be patient and understanding with everyone you encounter who doesn't believe that you are who you are. That who you are isn't real, that it is made up. 

I am not trans, I can only know how frustrating it is having your existence minimised from my experience with autism, through the less common people thinking I am not because I can hold a conversation, or through the minimisation of sensory issues. 

I can also very much understand the difference in the levels between these things. If I was trans I would not be able to deal with people. I already struggle with the comparatively pervasive in our society, but much less of a danger to my being, and much less of an affront to who I am. Having my sensory issues not considered ruins my day, fighting back against transphobia can run a great risk, being autistic doesn't put me at an increased risk for violence or sexual assault. 

People who say openly bigotted things, and then ask you to act with decorum, as if politely saying that you should be arrested for using the bathroom in accordance to the fact you identify as a woman, or saying that teaching kids of trans people's existence is predetory, or actively misgendering someone don't waive the expected decorum of a conversation the moment that the statements come out of their mouths.

They breach the social contract in almost every way but because they fulfilled one clause, acting polite despite their vitreol, they think that you as a trans person should be forced to act polite as well, and to uphold everything they disregarded.
As a kid I always internalized this one anime villain's thing about him not showing anger and just being cold so I don't think I've ever got this problem, people just act intimidated by me lol

But it really is odd how online people misgender me on purpose and act like I'm going to have a meltdown while in reality I care more about the speck of dirt outside
my thoughts go something like this.

""it's not my fault you're stupid, and if you've got questions that don't concern you, then it's not my problem.

If you want to be an ally just change the pronouns, don't judge for being a klutz, and just stay out of the way unless you're going to actually help.""

Usually I just keep my mouth shut, but I just wish others could do the same...
100% feel the same and yeah, a lot of us are just...very mad. And why wouldn't we be? This is totally reasonable. It's exhausting to live in a cissexist, traumatizing society where cis ppl can't even google. When I came out as transmasc, then the questions started. And they basically never stopped. Slap on the transphobia and seeing my peers in pain, scared, it's just a lot?

Of course a lot of us are angry.
I feel this today. Yesterday I came out as a trans man to my parents.
They both refuse to use the right pronouns and my dad told me to ""Never talk to me about this shit again. Do whatever you want with your life, but don't bring me into that stuff.""

Ok dad, one day you and my mom won't be in my life at all.
My two brothers who accepted me and my sister in law will because they aren't transphobic assholes.

I left for work in the morning and when I corrected my mom she said ""Don't say that"" and ""You'll always be my daughter""

I'm so glad I came out because I know that their fucking priorities aren't to love me. There is no unconditional love. I'm so mad and I'm so angry right now.

I honestly feel like crying too though even though part of me knew they wouldn't love the real me.
C’est la vie what can you do
Not having the space to feel frustrated or angry without people blaming hormones or some other important aspect of the trans journey has made me feel like the most crazy individual. Never been gaslighted so hard. 

Before T, if I argued with my mum I was seen as too sensitive and easily shut down. Now (after T) she throws words out like hostile, mansplainer, mental, and has threatened to call the cops because T makes me out of control. (What am I the fucking Hulk?) 

The amount of times I’ve picked up on how wording pre-T and now has changed whenever I show any ounce of frustration is insane. I’m one of the most emotional hate conflict people I know and testosterone hasn’t changed that.
absolutely, it does make me sad, but much much more it makes me want to break every object in sight
FUCK YEAH, LET'S START A *FIRE*

(in a legally allocated place, around which we civilly discuss our frustrations, perhaps raising our voices and using expletives to enhance the mood :3 )
Imagine living in a genderless world?
You'll be treated like if you weren't female or male. Just nothing and everyone is like that... except you.

I'm not trying to shoot you, maybe this day I'm not so patient and have NO FILTERS, because in a sense, I feel like you. I hate to explain even to other trans folks what the F am I.

Many assume I'm like them (i.e., drags, transvestites) l and I'm mistreated by those who claim all the time to be the only ones to be prosecuted marginalized and pissed off.

I'm effing tired of them also. You see, not only you is pissed off today.

Just fuck this world and everyone assuming being trans is a *sexual thing*.

PS: edited fucking typos.
[removed]
i find it alienating even in trans communities. like peopoe get upset when i get angery about them using the q word like in this post while it has no spoiler. it makes me hurt and people still use it
I do get that - and to be honest, it’s entirely understandable. However, anger is practically never the best solution to anything; all it tends to do is spread more anger than actually help.
I 100% agree
I use ti be angry all the time until I started HRT now I'm sad all the time lol
I feel the same.
Yes!
It's just a way to stereotype and invalidate you. Same as the 'gay rage'. No norval person would use it.
I’m not even fully out yet and I feel like a bomb
Like it or not, we are emissaries of our minority status. It is both a blessing (opportunity) and a curse (albatross).

It’s not fair. It’s never fair. But we can use it as an opportunity to be ambassadors for change.
it makes me so angry that i’m not allowed to be angry lmao
hm. i suppose thats reasonable. personally i could never transfer nor. cut my hair much or anything (ftm, family has always refused to let me cut my hair. also too broke to even think of transitioning oet alone a simple haircut unless i do it myself lol) 
so i can't say i understand this much besides the phobia as a general. it always seemed a bit nonsensical to me. 
like confusion is one thing but i mean were all human . yknow - i never even understood the 'testosterone evil raa' . seems a bit cruel to group people like that  . everyone has at least some testosterone . thats just life . i hope it gets better for yall though
Yes... 👏
Trans lives matter. I hope society can do better for y’all. The abortion issue language is also anti-trans. How hard is it to say “people who can get pregnant “ instead of “women.” The bulk of the legislation early this year (in the US) has been anti trans/trans erasure. It’s all going the wrong direction…
I feel you, I live with rage, It's been with me since I was an angry teenager and felt that something was wrong but couldn't figure what yet. The only advice I can give you is to find something to channel it in a positive way, for me it was music, music literally saved my life. For you could be something different, some activity, a sport, art, videogames, whatever that let's you channel all that bad energy in a safe way.
I saw a comment on another post talking about a time where someone was talking shit about trans people in front of them, and they didn’t want to say anything or else be seen as “that one angry trans person” 

Like, BE mad! Is that not a natural response to being shit talked? Let them know you’re not taking any shit. Don’t allow them to think that they can just say whatever.
same
If your testosterone makes you evil, then half of the world's people are evil. Damn, even everyone since cis women have testosterone too (although not that much)
I know this is supposed to be a serious thread, but how do i get the bi and trans flag on my profile? 

Im on mobile
And if I get angry I'm an ""emotional woman."" There's no winning.
I actually got very mad at a karen in my apartment and she said that exact thing i honestly wanted to tear her appart
I always read something about trans women letting their man self out whenever they're angry. Fuck that
Just the other day Joanne had a tweet calling out someone that put a sticker over a TERF flier that had colored knives that said ""TERFS weaponize the patriarchy against transfemmes by telling them what women should be.""

Her tweet was ""you can always tell a real woman by the pretty rainbow way she draws knives."" 

It's just so gross.
And if you're a trans man you get accused of roid raging. And some people really think testosterone and steroids are the same thing. My dad is supportive but even he believed that for almost two years of my transition because of all the deliberate misinformation spread especially during the Olympics.
Is that what it is? I never put two and two together that my breakdowns might be related to my being on the spectrum. I know you didn't intend to help but this actually helps quite a bit. Thank you
Its often said that you should try to be civil, to try and help people to learn about you and your existence, to understand it. To try and aid the ignorant in learning and to dissuade the bigotted through niceties and through setting a good example.

But not everyone can do that. And not everyone should. 

If people are unwilling to learn about how and why a significant group of people exist on their own time, that is their problem. You shouldn't have to walk someone through why you should be allowed to just exist and why your existence isnt a problem.

And frankly, the bigotted will find ammo regardless of whether or not you shout them down or enact violence. If you act nice, they often just think you are one of the good ones, and think that your quality as a person is in spite of who you are. If you act dismissive, they will just make stuff up about you. 

Bigottry is not a smart pattern of though, and it is often reinforced by equally stupid things. At least if someone is publically shamed or smacked, then the stupid thought process of ""if I say this stuff this might happen again"" will kick in and their bigotted asses will be careful next time.

To add, you do not have to pass, and should not have to pass in order to be trans. Its not relevant to what I have to say, but I want to say it so here it is.
thank you, will definitely check this out myself
yes! i was just going to comment the same thing lol
100% agreed. when all else fails, queer rage will force change to occur. no assimilation!
To quote Sheev Palpatine: “Let the hate FLOWWWWWW through you!”
That's the second time this week someone has recommended this piece, so I HAD to look it up:)

Click on [Click here to read this text](https://transreads.org/my-words-to-victor-frankenstein/) at the top of the page.
I call them I'm not Google days.
amazing idea
i love their music!!!!
queer has been a word used by this community for years, i beg you to educate yourself on the history before deciding it's a dirty word.
You joke, but a large number of people unironically believe this
Like for real i cant be angry as a trans women or shithead transphobes will tell me i act too manly...
A lot of people drank the gender essentialist koolaid from TERFs and unironically spout those views that demonize trans masculinity. For trans men, us taking T is basically like ultra-doping that makes us angry, violent rage machines and unworthy of support/basic kindness.
I used to identify as a cis woman (AFAB nonbinary person here, she/her) and my behaviors make me think I've got more testosterone than cis women usually do.
I go to a trans support group.  I much prefer being around other trans people.  I kind of wish there was a neighborhood in my metro area where lots of trans people lived so I could move there.
Yeah I definitely feel like I’m not allowed to get angry.
She’s obsessed.  It’s like half of her tweets.
Well as MtF I’ve been on testosterone and this has caused anxiety and anger and I was very easy to start rage. So it’s maybe better working in male brain, but for my female brain it was just terrible experience, I cannot go back on T ever.
Aspergerexperts.com have a great webinar called Deep into Defense Mode - it explains that people on the spectrum freeze first, then when they thaw out they go into fight or flight, either acting out or running away.  They also teach that people on the spectrum *need* safe people and safe places, to be *able* to calm down again, far more than neuro typical people.
it’s hurtful and makes me want to cry. i don’t use >!transexual!< because it hurts others and wish this was respected the same
Oh... I don't want to believe that but I'm sure your right, considering how some people are...
Yeah, a lot of TERF's and 2nd-wave feminist types demonize men and masculinity. When that hurts trans people, it's transphobia.

One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender. If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too. Good feelings for everyone.
my dad said ""not very ladylike"" when i got angry about something

those words felt like a thousand thorns (less now, because he's a transphobe, but y'know)
That's so sad. People generally don't seem to take women seriously which is also another issue

We all have the right to feel emotions but transphobic people will always use anything to invalidate both trans men and women :(
trans exclusionary ""feminists"" explaining how women aren't allowed to speak out of turn because that's rude
There's always the gayborhood in Philly if you're eillimh to relocate. I mean, for all I know you already live in Philly, so maybe it's not really relocating. Either way, at least visit. It's so relieving.
Seriously, if this exists I’m moving there today.
Yeah... That sounds like a ghetto :(
I say fuck that, I will call out anyone who disrespect me
My childhood friend came out as ftm, but refuses to transition because men should all die and testosterone evil
>One reason I like the trans communities on Reddit because they're generally positive and affirming about gender.

It seems a bit dramatic, a bit too *gushy* to say, but this is why I'm here.  It isn't that I'm here to help anyone - I'm rarely equipped for it - or to be helped directly - I'm at least as lousy at that.  Its that people come here and scream into the void only to find *someone* on the other end willing to offer some small bit of human decency.  That inspires me to help on those rare occasions that I think I can, but more importantly, it has helped me be okay with, well, *me*.
> If someone is MTF, they can be affirmed. If someone is FTM, they can be affirmed. If someone is non-binary, that's cool too.

Switching up the positive descriptor when it comes to NB people is trans culture /lh
No I don’t live in Philly.
Let's all move there and just take over the entire neighborhood lmao. A community made entirely of trans people, that'd be nice
Wow that's sad
super sad... trans men are not the ones who should be held accountable for the domestic abuse rates and r@pes made by CIS men (mostly. ofc trans men can do them but lets be honest it's a minority of crimes committed by men overall)
Shoot. Well, if you ever have a chance to take a trip. It's nice and refreshing to see pride flags on every lightpole and queer people on every sidewalk!
Yeeesssss😩
yeah...
please dont try to brush off the issue with this discourse by pushing the blame onto cis men. that doesnt help anyone and is still a bigoted line of thinking
That would be nice.  Where I live is fine.  My neighborhood is quite liberal but I’ve only seen one pride flag out beside my trans flag.
That emoji is not on the reddit list of approved emojis.I wish I was that brave
I suppose it'll be hard to convincz them. I would say that not all men are bad and they can be proof of that
Anddddd yes lol I’m going to make it my mission in life to start making that 🫡
Yeah but he was the kind of guy that would tell me a lot of gaslighting stuff, so not really a good guy.... I stopped talking to him like a year ago because he was saying that America is the worst country in the world to my immigrant family
That really sucks

Stood up to my transphobic mother's attempt to misgender/guilt me and it felt amazing.		"Eurgh, I'll never understand the ""I miss my son/daughter"" line, you're still the same person, except happier and more confident! You still have the same memories and shared experiences, that's what creates a relationship. I'm sorry your mum can't see past her own hangups.
You look amazing, well done for sticking up for yourself and doing what makes you happy <3
[Do not stand at my grave and weep.](https://a-trans-comic-by-me.tumblr.com/post/185304145197/do-not-stand-at-my-grave-and-weep-mary)
You look amazing!
Proud of you!!  Well done!
I'm so sorry you have to go through this. It's gutting when the people who are supposed to love us no matter what are tearing us down. I'm proud of you for standing up for yourself. You look great, and content in your skin. <3
What a great response! I don’t know how long you’ve been out to your mother but stick to your guns and hopefully she’ll come to her senses. It took my mother over a year to finally accept reality.
<3 Hugs for being awesome and sharing your moment!
I have no sympathy for people who put their twisted ideals over their own family forgetting unconditional love of their own child
But she never had a son, she always had a daughter
She’s the one who cut you out, and then she’s trying to guilt you? Fuck her. Good on you.
Honestly, the fact that she claimed that she missed you after she refused to treat you with respect is upsetting.
She took her role for granted. You are valid.
Badass lady right here <3
fuggin' *torched*.  well done.
This sucks, I'm sorry. You did the right thing
Damn I wanted to see the response
Her loss. Those two photos are the same person, living her life finally being able to be herself. If she can't be happy for you, then she doesn't deserve you. End of.
Damn.. that response is FIRE! I did the same to my mom the other day, she keeps acting like I am gone. This is how it was.
Her: This was you before.
Me: yeah and? Your point?
Her: I miss you.
Me: I don’t miss somebody who doesn’t accept me at all.
SLAYYYYYYY
why do you even talk to her, she sounds horrible :O
Would have liked to have seen the reply. 
People never like being held to account.
What a weirdo. The mother not you.
ooh savage come back way to go girlie you keep those healthy boundaries
It’s awful that she made you go through this. I’m proud of you for standing up to her and doing what is right for you!
Well done girl! 
There’s sooo much that we can say when family members verbally attack us by misgendering us and still talking to us as if who we are are bad people. But you stood up for yourself in a very simple and tasteful way. 
You did awesome!
Dude my mother did the exact shit. Shoved a baby photo of me in a bikini into my face and told me it is all I’ll ever be. You’re not alone out there. I’m very proud of you OP for standing up to them, it can be hard when all you want is some freakin acceptance!
I had the same with my parents. I haven’t spoken with my father since I came out to them. That’s been nearly two years. I’m mother kept taking his side, which I understand. But last year I had to cut off communication with her too. It’s sucks because we had a great relationship before, and it was 100% tier decision to have things this way. 

Sometimes it just better to back away from those people you love, and save yourself mentally.

me a trans: ""why do you miss a gender? how would a gender make much of a difference to your relationship with said offspring?""
PROUD OF YOU! Also you look so cute :)))
Ya, didn't have ta murder her. Jk.
Good for you! That's awesome, I know how hard that can be
Good for you. Keep being the best person you can be.
Das a burn for your mom. You roasted her stupid ways
Your mom got Ratio'd INCREDIBLY hard LMAO
Good on you for that
Proud of you 🤍
My mum did a very similar thing recently she put up a picture of me and her on Facebook saying how much things had changed bearing in mind I have people on my Facebook who think I'm cis so its an incredibly nasty thing to do.
classic toxic parenting 🙄

Boomers have such a big issue figuring this stuff out. Hurts their old oxygen-starved brains to comprehend that somebody can identify as something else.
It’s okay to cut toxic people out of your life just move on never talk to her again I believe in you
You aren’t dead. Your still here just loving who you are now.
DaMNNN thats killer
You go girl!
Well done.
I’m going through somewhat the same thing. Family can be brutal, but you’re amazing 🤩
Good job 👍 that was such a wonderful comeback! I had a few people make similar remarks, things like feeling like they were losing a daughter/sister/girlfriend and such, but I was really luck in that these people stuck around long enough to realize at my core I'm still the same person. 
Sure I will no longer stand for being labeled something I'm not, and I will speak up when you make assumptions about me and make me feel uncomfortable. I will dress in a way that makes me happy and comfortable, and I will not ask your permission to express myself. but at my core, I am the same.

I have the same likes and dislikes. The same hobbies and history. Everything I went through before I came out is still in my memory, even if I insist you use my correct pronouns when speaking about me before I came out. My political opinions have not changed, my personality has not changed. I still have the same dreams, and goals, and ideas.

I'm just happier now. More free to be who I am. No longer hiding when people hurt me, but saying nope this is me. If you don't like it, the doors right behind you, kindly f off.
I’m so sorry you have to go thru that but holy hell ma’am you are so freaking strong! I can’t imagine having the strength you do. You rock in the most squeeful of ways.
People of parents who do this, y’all should go into your parents phone settings and change the auto correct of your AGAB terms to your actual terms so whenever they try to type your AGAB terms they won’t be able to easily.

GET THEIR ASSES
wow shes kinda toxic :(
you might wanna buy her some ice
I've told people that I'm still me, and not to treat me like I'm special. I mean showing support is cool, it's actually a little bit overwhelming how much I've had from the people I've told and it sucks because not everyone gets that anm
I'm the same person as I was before. But I was never the person people thought I was before.
My deadname is masculine, but the diminutive version is androgynous. I simply made the diminutive version official, since that's what everyone calls me anyway. I figured that would subtly hint at the ""I'm still the same person you've always known"" thing. Unfortunately, instead, a few people seem to have taken it as a hint that I'm not really committed to this whole ""trans"" thing.
No, I'm not the same. I'm much more happy and confident now lol
1) I agree. 2) happy cake day sweetie
My parents only have photos of me pre-transition in their house.
[deleted]
That's when you come back with, I'm sorry my parents died.
I do the opposite since they deadname me. I make the statement that the old me is gone forever. Either suck it up and move on or leave me alone
agreed 100% and happy cake day!
Thank you for sharing that.

This was the first time she has spoken to me in 6 months. And before that, it was at least 3 months. I only ever respond because the lizard part of my brain tells me I should try to appease my mother…
She left me on read.
What is this comment? Why do we have to bring up passing on every picture of a trans person?
THIS
I'm just gonna tell my parents ""Well guess what, that person was fake. Hah! Too bad 😏🖕""

Cuz they're judgemental assholes
Yes!
The convenient thing for those types of people is the goalposts move to be whatever you didn’t do.  If you had chosen a less androgynous name, it would instead be “you chose that just to sound more effeminate!!!” Etc.  As hard as it is (and definitely depends on your own situation and what you can handle), I have found that the only way to resolve that is making clear they need to deal with it or they can deal with not having me in their life anymore.  That said, giving the ultimatum is hard as fuck and yea >.<
Aww thanks ❤️
I'm not sure about your situation specifically but I really hope things work out for you. Keep focusing on being yourself (as much as you can be while staying safe) and I'm sure you'll get to a better place ❤️
I love cake, thanks ❤️
Good bot
my mother was similarly shitty. I eventually cut her off, and was the best thing i ever did. Wish i had done it sooner tbh
The message was removed by a mod. What did they (roughly) say?
if a trans man looks like a man, he passes. if a trans woman looks like a woman, she passes. you dont have to pass to be trans btw :)

My Therapist: “You don’t like me misgendering you? Find someone else”	My therapist had been misgendering me on the reg for 10 months now. I finally broke and said wtf - and she essentially responded with “well if you don’t like it find a new therapist.” Feeling down just had to share	"I'm sorry, you don't deserve to be disrespected like that.
I would be filing what ever type of report and zero star review you could. There's absolutely no requirement for you to owe them the respect of paying them in time, money, or energy if they will not repay that respect, in turn, as a professional. Also, there's nothing that says anybody has to settle on the first therapist they find. Try a few different for that matter. Make sure they are right for you. That's what matters when it's YOUR therapy.
[deleted]
Extremely unprofessional!!! I would find a new therapist and file a complaint or leave them a bad review at the very least💩
Clearly not a good therapist. They're supposed to help you, not cause more anguish. Correct them once, if they continue, file a complaint with whoever you can, then find a new therapist.
[deleted]
Damn, turns out she actually *can* help you. I mean, ""get a new therapist"" is pretty sage advice in this situation.
I would take her advice.
Report this therapist to the state (or appropriate) licensing board. This is inexcusable, unacceptable, unethical and incompetent behavior for a licensed professional, and is a danger to clients and the field itself. This person needs a professional reprimand, if not revocation of their license. 

In all seriousness, for not only your sake and the sake of all this therapist’s current and future clients, you need to report them to the appropriate licensing board.
Report her and find a new therapist
Not sure if they are a licensed therapist.
Look for a new one and make sure to just quickly google search who ever you find.  Most searches will give you some info if they are supportive or not.  When you meet this new therapist, make sure to let them know right away what your gender is! : )
Ugh I had a therapist that yelled at me when I said I wanted to change therapists. She also said ‘I work with trans kids all the time!’ And proceeded to only use my dead name and misgender me. Not only was there that, but I found out only after I left that place, that that place was a female youth therapy place (they did other stuff too but all their pamphlets about their services used only she pronouns when referring to the patient.) it was rough and I did 8 sessions of therapy with her, each basically repeating the same info over and over. In my discharge letter she said that we hadn’t gotten past the introduction faze. 8 sessions!!! 8 sessions and I got nothing but dysphoria and reticule from her. 8 sessions is more then most therapy programs even offer! I’ve had so many issues with therapists- but the point of all this it to tell you I can relate, and it does get better
Hey, so I am both a trans woman and a licensed therapist. I'm going to tell you very clearly that this person is in violation of their code of ethics. Telling a client something like that is doing harm and people like that need to be taken out of my goddamn profession. My recommendation is that you make a formal report to the licensure board in your state or your country as this goes against the gender affirming model and is a violation of almost every code of ethics I'm familiar with. None of us should allow anyone to treat us this way.
how do they still have a license
They need to be reported to the state and everyone that is such bullshit
You're well shed of that waste.
Sometimes people tell you exactly who they are. Believe them.
She would lose her license over that. Completely unethical and inappropriate.
Then find a new one fuckem
Next!
Please report this.
I’d somehow leave a review or find their boss bc that is one terrible therapist
She's right about one thing, you absolutely should get a new therapist. How can you even take advice from someone like that?
I’m so sorry. You should report her and complain to her higher ups. This is not acceptable. It sucks how much therapy costs and how little they care about our mental health.
That's incredibly unethical and concerning behavior on the part of your therapist. Your therapist is not there to invalidate you and make you feel worse.Was your therapist licensed? If so they should have had you sign an informed consent at the beginning of treatment (if not that's another huge issue). On that document it should detail the licensing board and how to submit a complaint. If you're not sure and you're in the United States you can always just Google their name and licensure ( LPC, LCSW, LMFT, etc) and their information should pop up on your state boards website. Contact the number there and let them know what happened so they can investigate.

-my therapist wife
That's the best advice she has ever given you. I suggest you follow it as soon as possible. If she has a manager/boss I'd be having a talk with that person. Demand a letter of apology and a new therapist or go on the hunt. If you have a trans support group in your area, talk to them, they will know who will help and who will hurt. Let them know what you found, protect your peeps. Don't be down, be pissed. This is abuse, put an end to it.
Hey background on myself to preface. I'm a masters of social work student and an advocate. I'm also trans myself and got into this field because of disrespect like this. 

There are professional standards of care for caring with trans people. The guides are [here](https://www.wpath.org/publications/soc). It's always good to know your rights and know what you deserve and this is something you can share with professionals who do things like this.

I will also say that if the person is a social worker by profession (typically you'll run into LCSW if it's a therapist) then I would report them to the accrediting body. For social work, we have a really deep code of ethics that has a lot of roots in social justice, diversity, and equity. I think it's important to hold others accountable to that, especially in a profession where it's one of our biggest values.
Nobody deserves that. I'm in the very early stages of preparing to transition. My therapist is probably the best trans specialist therapist in the province. Her first questions to me (on her patient registration form) were ""What name and pronouns do you want me to use?"".

My egg cracked just 5 months ago and I'm in my late 60s, heavily bearded AMAB, and except for a few places online where I now present as a trans fem, I present physically as male (for the moment), so I was fine with her using my birth name and male pronouns.

She figured out 20 minutes into my first session that my lifelong depression issues were nothing more than the manifestation of undiagnosed gender dysphoria, and by the end of the first session she was recommending that I had to transition for my own mental health. I can't start transitioning now due to family and employment issues, so I need to keep presenting as male (will get more difficult when she provides the authorization for my hormone therapy in a month's time) but even so, at the start of each session, she checks to see if I want to switch to my chosen name and female pronouns.
hi im training to become a counselor and that shit should get her reported to her licensing body, her supervisor (if she has one), and her professional organization. multicultural respect and competence is part of my organizations code of ethics and violating that is absolutely unacceptable. shes also refusing to put the clients needs (of being respected in your identity) above her own (of being a fucking jackass) which is NOT how therapeutic relationships are supposed to work and also a violation of code of ethics. im so sorry this happened to you my pal im sending you lots of love from your trans brother 💜💕
Pausing for a moment to appreciate the self love that speaking up required. That alone is a huge milestone 💕☺️💞
Wow.. should be illegal.. I'm sorry you had to experience that 🥺
Yeah nah. If someone doesn’t respect you on that basic a level, how can you expect them, a therapist, to have your best interests at the forefront of their considerations?
That’s the complete opposite of what their job is, file a complaint to who’s in charge, and make that masters degree they needed to become an extremely expensive piece of paper
That’s so insensitive of them, and that is against the rules, you are the judge of them. They are there to help you, not to basically tell you what will and what will not happen
That therapist should be disgusted with themselves and they don't deserve your time or money. There are plenty out there who will treat you with the respect you deserve. 

Stay strong ❤💙
Damn they should not be a therapist, period
You're paying this person to support you and help out with your life, not shit on you. You deserve better.
If you can review her on something rip her ass in the review and then go find another therapist cause fuck that shit
Report this therapist to local licensing boards.
Yeah this is grounds for loss of licensure in most of the US. You can google “[state] therapist licensing board” and the place to file a report should be on the state’s website.
Where the hell did you find this therapist?
Report your therapist to the company and board. That is a total violation of so many policies and codes of conduct. That is so unbelievably unacceptable.
After a message like that it might be a good idea to fine a new therapist sorry to say that just being honest
I work with peer support here where I'm from if you ever need to talk let me know and if not maybe I can help
Report this person to whatever board they are certified by. This is 100% unacceptable.
I'm very sorry that happened to you, that therapist was stupid and shouldn't even be working in that field if that's how they act, I hope things get better.
What the actual fuck
ok honestly u should find a new therapist if u can
What kind of therapist....  fuck that person, honestly.
Yikes. Shitty therapist.
what the fuck is her problem
Do exactly that. You deserve better.
Report them. And get yourself a better therapist who has the common decency to respect human beings.
Fuck. Her.
That's a shitty therapist. If she's working for an office or a company report what she has been doing. You can get better help from someone who's an actual good therapist and not a bigoted one.
Wow. Fuck your therapist
That’s fucking ridiculous. The exact opposite of how a mental health professional should be acting. I’m sorry you had to deal with that and I hope you can find a therapist who can take better care of you.
It sounds like that’s the only advice of theirs you should take
Report them if you can, therapist **should not** do that
If you’re down to casually drop a full name and service provider I’m down to send a nasty email
That’s so ridiculously horrible I literally laughed out loud. And this is somebody that supposed to be helping you. Unbelievable.
Why the heck were you going to her for so long? I’ve been going to therapy for 10 months as well for the sole purpose of dealing with my gender dysphoria and my therapist has been really great about it. She was the first person to start using my preferred name and pronouns. That’s what the therapist of a trans person is supposed to do. If your therapist has been disrespecting you and intentionally misgendering you for as long as you’ve been seeing her, stop seeing her. She’s not doing you any good.
What the fuck… u needa expose her online u should dox her
That is truly a terrible therapist, they don't seem like they want to help you.
Walk tf out immediately and call em everything they are. Fuck that hate and ignorance.
I agree, you should find a new therapist, one thats not a transphobe.
Thats sad to read. It's highly disrespectfull. You should never again let someone treat you like that. If someone does not respect you, that someone earns no attention from you
You should report her/him
As a therapist this pisses me off so much. I would like to apologise for that happening to you and do agree you should definitely get a new therapist.  Thankyou next! you definitely deserve someone better who can show you some respect! Hopefully your next therapist can help you with the closure of you horrible experience. Good luck on your journey x
trypride cansiling
Well that’s her problem
Report them
A) find new therapy professional 

B) report the first one because they're not.
Not really a great therapist are they… hope you find a better one :) you deserve better :(
Find someone else and leave a **helpful** little review so other people can 'find someone else' and not waste their time too
just wtf!?!
Fun fact: you don’t owe your therapist anything. If they ever stop being useful to you, drop them. They are there to serve you and your purposes, not the other way around. Fucking ditch them immediately.
I'm so sorry you had to deal with that.

Honestly you probably *should* find a new therapist. They're going to consistently misgender you and not even try to get it right, then they don't deserve your money. If it were up to me, they'd lose their license.

You deserve better.
You should cancel your next appointment (and any subsequent ones you have scheduled) and when the office asks you why, you can just tell them ""They told me to find someone else. That's what I'm doing. I don't deserve to be treated this poorly, and they don't deserve my money.""

I hope your next therapist is better. :/
Over due for a new therapist
Listen, you can fire ANYONE in your life who misgenders you. As you move forward in time and continue to surround yourself with people who see who you really are life will get easier and easier.  Let the haters slip away.
Therapists are supposed to create a safe space for their clients, period. If they couldn't respect basic pronouns then they should have suggested someone else a long time ago, in your best interest. This therapist is not good and I recommend trying to find someone else. 

I know therapists aren't easy to find but if you have any health insurance, often they will list their in-network resources and sometimes they will give an indication as to whether or not each therapist has experience with sexuality or gender as it relates to the LGBTQIA+ community. The folks who deal with gender are few and far between but they are out there.

It took me years to find a good therapist who I had good chemistry with (in general) and when I met her, she had very little experience with trans/enby people. She literally went and did her own research, spoke to her peers to find someone who did have experience, and then proceeded to learn for the benefit of my care and the care of future clients. She did that with other topics I brought up too. Good therapists are out there and I am sending positive vibes that you find one because you don't deserve to be misgendered in a safe space.
please, they are right: find another therapist
First of all I’m super sorry that she just seems like a hateful person!!! But I would definitely take her advice and find someone else because she clearly doesn’t get it.
That is NOT a good therapist and you should make a formal complaint. That is discriminatory, harassing, and basically not giving you a safe environment. Therapy should be safe and open and if your therapist has bias against you then they shouldn't be practicing in a standard office. Their job os to prioritize your safety and that is NOT. Make a complaint and get yourself a better therapist. Cuz of they are gonna do that to you they will do it to others too and action needs to be taken. Obviously Idk where you live but I do know in my state this is taken more seriously and personal bias does not come into play with bias with all mental health professionals i have dealt with in the 3-4 years I have had treatment. Everyone I have worked with have been nice and made an effort to affirm my gender.
I have a wonderful therapist that's LGBTQ+ friendly and she does virtual sessions as well. Would you like a link to her Instagram?
I’m so sorry. That’s a sad reaction from someone possibly too insecure to admit they are making an error.
You deserve better.  And she should know better.  My doctor's tried to get me to see another therapist but my insurance pays for two, one who isn't a therapist but a licensed social worker who's specialty is young children.  The other one... I liked till she quit and the lady they got to replace her believes everyone should be on pot to cure everything.  So I'm turning to my communities and friends when I need help.  I hope you find someone who can help you and who treats you better. -offers digital hugs-

I would've told her to fuck off, and walked.  God damn that's rude.

Mine's slipped up a few times, and immediately corrected herself, but I know that she believes I'm not a fucking man.  The occasional error doesn't bother me.

Mistakes happen, but that shit is inexcusable.
WHAT. What an asshole. I’m so sorry. There are a lot of bad therapists out there and I hope you fired this one immediately. I fired one before and losing her made me feel so much lighter. You deserve to be respected, especially by people providing you services for payment.
You need to file a formal complaint toe every state agency,federal agency that there is- 
Also, possibly try and schedule another appointment with this therapist- use the voice recorder on your phone, try and get them into a conversation about misgendering you- admitting it, then, shortly after, just walk out!!! 

You know the rest.😉❣️🌹🏳️‍⚧️
Garbage human,  sorry you have to deal with this.
My therapist was the exact same way with me.. & it felt like absolute shitt.. mines would misgender me in front of my own mother.. bc they had thought that.. i was transgender.. & i I had told them that i was gay🏳️‍🌈 & a crossdresser.. & then.. they was like.. Oh.. sorry.. & i was like it’s okay.. but then again.. i still hated being misgendered and shitt.. like..it fucking sucks..
all i can say is.. Stay strong.. & find you a new therapist that can help you & stuff.. you would feel a lot better.. if you just find the right help and much more..❤️❤️❤️
That’s horrible! Maybe you should give them a taste of it and call them the wrong name and pronouns and when they correct you jusy ignore them, do it for a week then ask them to call you by your pronouns again? Im not sure how to deal with these situations.. Not the bext advice sorry
Wow, what a piece of shit. Report her to the clinic head.
This is the part where you fully name them, location, and link their site so google can index it.
That’s such a terrible experience. There are sadly so many people that should not be therapists.
Yo wtf?! Can you report her somewhere? This person shouldn’t be a therapist.
Well looks like you're finding a new therapist
Whoever talks to someone like that in such a way, shouldn’t be a therapist
File a complaint. Here in Canada that’s taken very seriously by officials in healthcare. It’s unacceptable
Drop that doc like a cough drop
Take her advice. She’s an asshole
just curious, how exactly did they do that when they dont use pronouns when speaking directly to you?
This is abuse and should definitely be brought up to the local governing body for her license
I would like to slap that woman. You are a human being and you deserve to be respected.
You absolutely should fire him immediately and find a new therapist. He is not serving your best interests. As icing on the cake I would file a complaint with his governing body.
They need to get get their licence revoked cause that's actively damaging
Find a new therapist then, less money for this old bat. Good luck.
Sounds to me she never wanted you as a client and had a hidden agenda from the beginning. Had she really help you with your Dysphoria?

First, I must say love yourself more and never go beyond the first appointment of being misgendered without saying anything. 

Second, fire those that continue misgender or disrespect you. Doctor, therapist, or whoever professional fire 🔥them. I suspect they want to be rid of you.




Second
That's the best advice this idiot ever gave ya! Kick em outta yo life like a carved pumpkin on November first
Your therapist is right. You absolutely should get a new therapist
That's not a therapist
what the fuck????????? you don't deserve that. take their advice and move to greener grass, take care hun. remember that you're absolutely valid.
don't you just love it when the person that's literally paid to help you does the opposite for tiny petty reasons 💃
I'm sorry you had to go through that <3 I hope you're ok.

 I hope you don't mind me also sharing a story about medical professionals being ill-informed about trans stuff. When I came out a year and a half ago at 18 (well I'd come out several times since the age of 13 but was dismissed as being 'too young' but my parents are more supportive now luckily), I had to call my GP and ask for an appointment to be referred to a gender clinic. Whilst on the phone to my GP he said 'maybe you should sort out your autism before you start worrying about your gender' (he meant my autism assessment, I'd been waiting for several years already). It made me have a meltdown because I was so frustrated, I had already spent years of my childhood/early teenagehood having my autistic behaviours be dismissed as a result of trauma (despite having presented the symptoms before the traumatic event), and now my dysphoria is dismissed as a result of my autism. It was also dismissed as a result of trauma too, I guess it's easier for parents to think it could be 'cured' through therapy than having to be seen as a freak by society. I'm so glad that I was finally allowed to cut my hair (when I was younger, I asked what my mum would do if I cut my hair on my own and she said she'd never forgive me and I took it literally so I never had the courage to just cut it myself, I was only allowed to wear 'boys' clothes after massive meltdowns and everything was a battle and I feel sad that I didn't get to have a happy or comfortable childhood). It seems I cannot be taken seriously as it took me almost ending my life for my parents to finally accept me and let me myself at 18. I try not to dwell on the past as I know some people can't transition until they're very old. Being transgender is hard enough without the added stress of transphobia. Most of us have spent our whole lives being invalidated, to the point where we internalize that and deny ourselves the right to be ourselves, and for a lot of us that turns into ideation of not being alive anymore. It's already so difficult and then things like what happened to you happen and it's just another knife in the heart (sounds dramatic but you get my point). 

Sorry for spilling my heart out and oversharing. If anyone who isn't out of the closet yet happens to be reading this (I know I read hundreds of forums from 13+ as I realised I was trans) then just know that it's not all doom and gloom. It WILL get better, and it's ok if you're not able to/safe enough to come out just yet. There are people who are here for you, people who will listen and people who will support you <3
Report the asshole! Therapists are supposed to provide a safe place for clients, not create a hostile one!
They dont deserve to be a therapist and Id love to take their license away myself. Therapy is supposed to be a no judgement zone and you didn't deserve that shit. I'm sorry you have to deal with it. 
This is somewhat like how I hear that literal RNs and Doctors are refusing the covid vaccine. Fucking stupid bullshit and they all shouldn't be in the field if they're gonna attempt to mix their judgemental, closed minded, and often religious or political ""beliefs"" in with hard and soft sciences and very personal care of each individual.  Its really interesting how people think this is okay and I'm not for discrimination, I also know that bible thumping, homophobic, transphobic, xenophobic, racist shitheads don't get enough of ehat they deserve and that's to be taken down off the power pedistal. This therapist had power and abused it. Yeah every individual can have intersectionality on how they go through life their beliefs but that ""therapist"" was incredibly unprofessional and shouldnt have an issue eith it if theyre a good one to begin with. I hope you find someone who you can actually feel safe with.
That's not a therapist, that's just a regular grade asshole with a fancy title they don't deserve
Is clear … look for another one, you deserve to have a therapist that understand and respect your struggles
If they medicaid complaint this is a lawsuit
A therapist should have your best interests at heart, and if they are KNOWINGLY doing something that is hurting you (even if it's only mentally), you should find a new therapist, and report them to the relevant authority for ""deliberately influencing someone into negative and harmful thoughts.""

Get the bitch to lose her licence, so she can't hurt anyone else.
10 months? Wtf? Maybe allow them a month to get adjusted but don't take shit from them. You can always find a better therapist.
Transphobic much? XDDDDD
Why did you pay for a knobhead when there is like hundreds of therapists out there?
Sounds like the best advice they could give. Find a better therapist.
that therapist needs to be fired asap
That sucks a lot, and I'm sorry you had to deal with that. 

But but but!

It sounds like that's really good advice!
Sounds like a terrible therapist.  I am so sorry for how you were disrespected.
So sorry that happened , fuck her , take ur money elsewhere . What a pos, I hope she starves .
Drop their name so we know who to avoid.

Side note: is there a master list of trans friendly and transphobic therapists somewhere?
What the actual fuck? That's so unprofessional! If they didn't want to work with you because they weren't comfortable with trans people (which I assume is why they were a completely unprofessional a-hole that refused to respect you), ethically they should have referred you instead of casting additional MH stress.

Super sorry this happened to you! You'll find someone else better!
My therapist told me “I’d prefer if you didn’t come back” when i told her i came out as trans. So i found a new one and i’m a lot happier. I hope you can too ❤️
In Europe u could just sue them or something because they're endangering people in their job. No therapist would ever misgender you here, at least not public ones. Even the therapist who nearly got me taken away from my parents uses my preferred pronouns and name
Definitely need a new therapist. I’m sorry this happened to you. You’ll find someone who will treat you right. 💖 Hugs my friend
fucking pos, probably just projecting her insecurities on you, you didn't deserve this. Hope you find the right one, good luck!
What the fuck? Sounds like a crappy human AND crappy therapist. I hope you have the resources to find someone new. Maybe you have a friend who sees someone they like?
What a terrible therapist
Just to clarify, is it like, she theoretically respects your pronouns but keeps making accidental slips of the tongue despite her honest efforts to use the right pronouns, and she is saying that she is already trying her best but if you need someone who is better at not making those mistakes so that you feel respected in your safe space, she supports that?

Or is she fundamentally disagreeing with your right to declare your own gender/pronouns?

I ask because especially in older generations with the pronoun ""they"", I see people who have a hard time retraining their brain to see it as a singular pronoun (the brain does become less flexible with age) but they honestly, honestly try and get really apologetic when they mess up. And then I also see people will just say ""no! They is plural! I refuse to bastardize the English language that way!"" as if their (inaccurate!) grammar rules are more important than people's feelings. So I guess, whether you should report her vs just move on to someone else with no hard feelings, maybe depends on the context a little bit.

Either way, you obviously deserve to work with someone whose language use doesn't trigger you at your most vulnerable moments! And I'm sorry you have to deal with this on top of everything else you must be going through :(
That sucks and you definitely don’t deserve to be mistreated like that. I would highly suggest finding a new therapist.
That “therapist” should be fired immediately. It is absolutely unacceptable to treat a patient like this. I’m so sorry you had to go through that OP.
Find someone else. If your therapist isn't helping you, then you are allowed & usually expected to change your therapist. You're under no obligation to stick with them at all.
Report them, love. They deserve their license revoked.
She's a terrible therapist, she's doing the exact opposite of her job!
Me to your therapist: (ง ͠° ͟ل͜ ͡°)ง don't pick a fight if you can't win
As someone training to be a therapist, this enrages me. I’m so sorry you had to experience that. What a lowlife. Find someone else who will respect you for you. <3

Edit: If you feel the need to, you can report them to the national licensing board because them doing that is against ethics.
That's horrid. Whats wrong with them!? They're there to help.... And that's part of the problem.
report her to the board and find someone who values you
Dang.

""Oh I'm A gOoD tHeRaPiSt""

They don't deserve you.
shit that happens to me too ): she also calls me the wrong name ?
I just had to switch mental health professionals yesterday after downright abusive treatment. I will never understand why certain people take jobs in MENTAL HEALTH and can’t be compassionate. Using your power to abuse people is so not ok, I am sorry you are going through that. ):
That is so wrong, sorry that happened to you, sounds like poor tac
Report the fuck out of them
Therepists are meant to make you feel better though I swear. Or is this a difgerent meaning of the word?
I think you *should* find a new therapist, she sounds awful. I corrected my therapist on my pronouns and she thanked me for standing up for myself. I’m sorry your therapist turned out to be so defensive and immature.
I would definitely take her advice and find a new therapist.
Welp she’s fired and yeah make sure every outlet possible knows she’s a transphobe so this doesn’t happen to anyone else. Fucking hell, I’m so sorry.
LMAO what a cunt , im sry 💝
I think you do need to find a new therapist to understands about being trans and about gender, because frequently misgendering you and then dismissing it and blaming you for it is absolutely inappropriate. You are allowed to be you and a therapist is supposed to help you, not hurt you. I'm glad you called her on her Behavior. When looking for a new therapist, ask them questions about their experience or understanding of transgendered people because you deserve someone helpful and kind and understanding. I'm sorry you had someone who was supposed to help you instead be rude and ignorant.
Thanks
My thoughts exactly! Who ever this therapist is, they are not fit to be in the business of helping anyone - let alone therapy! I hope you can find a good therapist that treats you with the respect you deserve! I'm sorry you had to go through that experience.
Truth, the sad part is I vetted all the others in my area before settling with her, which I thought worked for a while.  Which is why it hurts more I guess.
[deleted]
Came here to say basically this.
For free crisis /suicidal counseling there’s also the Trevor Project
[removed]
Damn what a zinger!
They are, unfortunately
Thanks, yeah that’s my intention.  I’ve been seeing this therapist for a few years and only came out  last year with out any queer community  so I just assumed this is just what it is.
Thank you 💜💜
[removed]
To who? She has a private practice
Agreed
Thank you, I will look into the resources you provided
Thanks for the validation
[removed]
Facts. We pay them to help us which means we hire them. So if they aren't doing their job, fire them.
Pretty sure we all would lol
I've said this once, I'll say this for the thousandth time. Pain is not something that can be compared from person to person, since every single person on this planet will react differently to different types of pain. Just because a problem is small to you, doesn't mean it doesn't matter and it doesn't mean you have to march in and demand everyone just deal with it since you've gone through worse. Kindly take your ignorance somewhere else, not on a rant post where the op is already down.
Your experiences and feelings are valid, and they also don't negate this person's experiences and feelings. I'm sorry you've experienced so much hate and pain as a result of your skin color. We absolutely need to do more to end this kind of suffering in the US (and everywhere). However, lashing out at others on a board that's supposed to be a safe space for them to vent and get support isn't helping anything. Let people have their feelings and please validate their experiences. Just as you have experienced invalidation and hate, don't turn around and give that to others. Seeing a therapist to work through the trauma and related feelings you're experiencing might be helpful for you. Best wishes to you.
Hey, just here with a warning for everyone: u/ClassicStutz is a massive bigot who trolls trans people into ""helping"" him, then proceeds to berate and harass us. I've got 30 pages of evidence, if anybody needs to see it. Please do not engage with this bigoted asshole, for your own sake. <3
No, it's not a good therapist. No therapist should regularly misgender the person they're supposed to be helping for *10 months*, especially because that's been known to lower mental health. Constant misgendering is not helping, it's hurting, and telling a patient ""if you don't like it, find someone else"" is extremely unprofessional and quite frankly, childish. This therapist knows that they're hurting their patient and doesn't care, that's not someone who should working in that field.

In some states within the wonderful usa
<nods> You need to drop that therapist.  If they can't understand the very basics there is no way they can reasonably treat you for anything else.  Really sorry this happened, you don't deserve it.
Make sure to drop a really nasty review too when you dump them
Think of it this way, you got rid of a bad influence who had access to your most vulnerable thoughts and emotions.
This is definitely malpractice
I'm sorry you have to go through this though. Have you tried any of the websites that work as a middle for therapists and clients. My therapist and myself only do video meetings, but I was able to broaden my search area.
There are a lot of doctors out there who declare themselves to be trans-competent, but are actually not.

The ""not"" can range from being mildly transphobic to trying to convince the patient they have schizophrenia and should detransition.
Remember there are a lot of online therapy options that can help you connect with trans friendly therapists. You are not limited to just the therapists in your area.
I used to speak to my therapist over the phone after I moved away, perhaps you could find someone that does over-the-phone sessions?
[deleted]
I only do t for t treatment now, I'm much happier.
You certainly have a lot to say haven't you? 🙃

If I understand correctly, you made a comment about us mixing LGBTQ+ issues with BLM. Black lives do matter. That means that every black life matters. That means that LGBTQ+ black lives matter. You don't get to pick and choose whose POC's life matters more than who's. You don't get to say ""Whose black lives matter?"" Every single one of them does.

Hoping your post will get taken down. Bye 👋
Ok, here we go. 
  First off, the things people complain about here are real problems, sometimes that are just as bad as what's happening to African Americans. In the south trans people who don't pass are assaulted, murdered and worse, sometimes *legally*. The trans community goes through alot of the same shit that African Americans do and have. You just hear about those more because there are more African Americans than trans people, and it's impossible to hide that you're African American in person. Yes, there are some people here who don't acknowledge the problems of other people. And of course we don't talk about those here, this is r/trans, not r/blm. We only talk about the problems that directly affect us here. Sometimes that does mean a black trans person will complain about problems they face for their race, and they get the same support as everyone.
  Second, misgendering is a big deal for some people, especially when it's a therapist. They are supposed to help people, not hurt them. Period. Some people are constantly on the brink of suicide because of their dysphoria and a single case of misgendering can be what puts them over the edge.
  Third, police in the south do the exact same shit to trans people too. People talk about that more because it's a newly exposed issue and there has been less support for these issues than those of the African Americans. Has the been a trans president? No, there hasn't, and probably wont be for some time, because believe it or not, people still aren't as accepting of trans people as they are of black people.
  Fourth, no one here is as big a coward as you, coming here into *our* community trying to attack us. There are literally thousands of us here, each of whom is a different individual, and some of whom don't live in America at all. I have seen several European in here, especially eastern Europeans where it is much less accepting to be trans. How would you like it if I came into your house and attacked you and your family?



And just incase this coward deletes his post, for those of you who read this, here is his entire post in a quote to be immortalized. You want vindictive? I'll give you vindictive. 
>Darn she said ""fuck this person""..ALRIGHT. Thats the supportive LGBTQ2+ community that I know and love. Trolling with the truth. Yall seem really vindictive...not just talking about this interaction, I mean in general. You complain about EVERYTHING and want to cancel EVERYONE. Who is safe around you? The fact that the actual plight of what the police are doing to black America gets lost in conversation to this bull is nonsense. Where are my reparations? You all got EVERYTHING and you're trying to get a person disbarred or whatever its called for misgendering. Fucking christ, grow a back bone because you all don't talk like this in public. I approach you ALL and none of you talk like this face to face. This community is full of cowards.


Oh and p.s. asshole, I would absolutely say all this shit to your ugly sad excuse of a face.
Also, sorry to hear they weren’t professional enough to notice your discomfort all this time.  Hope you find one your looking for!
It's simple really. The whole of the medical community and the psychological community validate trans identities and there is demonstrable evidence showing that we exist and that we are the identities we say we are. Your beliefs are antiquated and backward. And I hope someday you realize the harm that you do by posting little shitty things like this because well I have good support systems and good friends. You could really hurt some trans kid who's just trying to express themselves.
The state licensing board. This is a violation of the ethics of the profession. Not sure where you live, but in Utah, the state licensing board is called DOPL. It might be something similar where you live (if in the US). You can file a complaint online in Utah, so that might be an option for you, too. Source: I'm a therapist in Utah. Please report this! I'm sorry you experienced that.
If she's a legally licensed therapist, she can be reported to whatever council licenses therapists where you live. Her practice being private is irrelevant to them. Here it is called the Board of Examiners In Counseling - I found it by googling ""who licenses therapists"" so it should be easy to find out.
As others have said if she has a licence she'll have been granted that licence by some kind of organisation. Here in the UK it would be the BACP.
My therapist asks me at every seance how I want to be gender by her. This is respect. And professional.
Well, the therapist is supposed to be qualified for the post. She's supposed to respect the clients. And obviously she doesn't and this is why said that. As a therapist, she has the obligation to respect them. In my opinion she's not qualified that's it. I don't have any study in psychology but I know I'd do better.
[removed]
They can even report the therapist if there's a board or similar in the country. Even here in Mexico you can report therapists when they're actually harming you, albeit it's hard here.
That’s a good way of looking at it , thank you
Hot take here but not everybody who thinks they're trans should actually transition.  I'll always take someone at their word they are who they say they are, because it's not my place to tell someone their own truth, but I feel like it is the job of a trained professional to explore these things so people can actually find the best path on their own personal journey.  Which is why shitty doctors scare the fuck out of me.

Not really sure why I typed all this.  I guess it's just not a conversation I see people having.
I chose a trans counselor to talk about my gender identity and discuss transition and whatnot, because I felt uncomfortable with the notion of having to explain being trans to a cis person. I felt like having a trans person would allow them to empathize better.

Not only has that been successful, I've been able to give him a few pointers with the legal side of things as I blundered my way through a covid riddled world where all the printed rules are out of date. It's felt like mutual assistance and it's been very pleasant.
Pls continue the good work, the world need more people like you

I do want to add to this, that it's actually quaint that this person thinks that we haven't sought treatment. Like, do they realize that we have to go see therapists to eventually get letters to get HRT unless we're doing informed consent? Do they understand that I had to see a gender therapist for months until I was approved? The idea that you can know me or know what I've had to do or what treatment I have sought for which mental illness is insanity. It's a logical fallacy brought on by the idea that you think that I am behaving insane when in reality you are the one that is against all available data and making projections towards a person you don't even know. It's really pathetic when you think about it.
Thank you this is great info
You.. You realize that being gay / trans is illegal in over half the world, right? Many places in which it is punishable by death.. Stop trying to play this shitty game of who's oppression is worse. Oppression is oppression, accept that many different groups are oppressed, and try to help each other instead of tearing each other down.

Maybe instead of trying to tear down the LGBTQ+ community, try to be an ally and hold them up, and the same should go for the LGBTQ+ community and black communities. We shouldn't try and push each other down, we should try and hold each other up..

MODS, PLEASE BAN THIS GUY!!!!!
I literally never said they were equal. I said none of them mean nothing. Of course some problems are worse then others, what do you take me for, an idiot? But that doesn't mean you can tell op they should just ignore it and literally saying a therapist that purposely worsens their patients mental health is still a good therapist.
People do get murdered just for being trans, but seriously, it's not a fucking competition.
I see you're heavily downvoted, but looking quickly it doesn't seem you're a troll, so, let me at least argue why I do believe you're wrong.

Thing is, the probability someone identifying as transgender while being mistaken and cis is **very** low, if you look at the statistics, in the USA, the number of people that say they identify as trans is 1 400 000, on those 1.4M, 280 000 will detransition

**HOWEVER** the main cause for detransition isn't ""I was wrong"", it is lack of family/friend support, in fact, only 0.4% of those 280 000 persons, so, 1 120 persons on 1 400 000 will have been cis people that transitioned by mistake.

By having a therapist have the final say if one should transition or not, you're risking the life of more than a million person to save a thousand from being wrong.

--

It is also worth nothing that ""trained professional"" are often not that well trained on gender dysphoria and trans issues, that why so many of us got other behavioral diagnostic before starting to transition.
...do you think I shouldn't have transitioned? Based on what, a bad doctor who tried to put me on lithium?
Oh, sorry. I'll keep that in mind for next time.
I'm definitely not trolling.  Possibly misinformed, possibly just projecting my own insecurities, but always willing to have a respectful conversation about it.

I'm also *absolutely not advocating* that anyone other than the person themselves should have the final say in what they get to do with their own body.  I'm aware that making a third party the arbiter is a tool of the oppressor - I have transgender friends in Norway.  Nobody should have to petition the government to be allowed their titty skittles, only to be denied because they got a tattoo once and that's apparently indicative of some pattern of reckless behaviour.  Shit like that *really pisses me off*.  

But there's people out there who think they're owls, because they're not willing to admit they might just be transgender.  Because it's easier to identify as an animal (impossible to do anything about!) than as a different gender to the one they were assigned at birth (real and very scary future!) And there's people out there who feel intensely uncomfortable in their own skin as just one of the many issues they have.  Some of their other issues can be fixed by talking about them.  Sometimes, admittedly very rarely by the statistics you've shared, their gender issues are part of these things that can be worked on without making drastic life choices. 

I'm aware that the most effective treatment for gender dysphoria is transitioning.  I'm aware that not everybody who's trans has gender dysphoria.  And I'm aware that some people occasionally entertain the thought of being someone else, and not every thought needs to be acted upon.  This is why people should have the freedom to experiment with their genders.  This is why places like r/transtryouts exists.  Maybe they'll find they didn't like it after all, or maybe they realise they wanted it their whole lives and just didn't know it.  But maybe echo chambers aren't the way forward, and the fact that I'm getting downvoted to shit for trying to have a reasonable conversation might be indicative of a bigger trend that makes people skittish to voice any dissent, even about their own experiences.  

Feel free to tell me I'm wrong about any and all of this.  I'll listen.  I like learning things.
Did transitioning make you happy?  Then you absolutely should have transitioned.
> and the fact that I'm getting downvoted to shit for trying to have a reasonable conversation might be indicative of a bigger trend that makes people skittish to voice any dissent, even about their own experiences.

No offence but that probably has more to do to where you're posting it, this isn't asktransgender where people are trying to have a discussion on topic, this is the post of someone venting they've been discriminated by their therapist, emotions are running high, same reason you can't just ask victims of crime what the appropriate punishment for their attackers is, or you'd end up with a lot of death penalty for stolen bicycles :)

Add to the fact that, without context, it could have looked like concern trolling (I'm gonna be honest with you, I looked through your history to try to figure that one out), and you end up with people being quick to shut it down.

It is also probably no mystery I'm the one responding to you being I got especially lucky with my own transition and had no real gatekeep.

Now on the subject there is multiple problem, because while many have others problem in addition of their dysphoria, the first issue is that you cannot know, as long as the transition isn't started, what is and what is not caused by dysphoria and the second one is that you unfortunately cannot help someone that doesn't want the help.

Requiring a therapist in the loop mean that people that are afraid of facing the others problem will either not go, and things will get worst because, yes, transitioning is at this point the best solution - or they will just learn what lie they need to tell to get where they need, but in no case will it actually serve a purpose.

This is even more toxic in case the therapist end up being unsafe, trans people internalize quite a whole lot of transphobia usually, and you can end up with therapist that play on those fear to manipulate patient into not transitioning - that even if the therapist don't have a say on the patient treatment.

Each one transition is also different in term of timing, in term of what they do, and you can't really standardize a way that wouldn't hurt many.
\> trans people internalise quite a lot of transphobia usually

Yes, that's why I'm here leaving shitty unasked for comments in reddit threads rather than out there in the real world trying to find a way to live my truth.

You make some good points.  This was neither the time nor the place for me to have this conversation, and I appreciate that you took the time to talk me through some stuff.  

For the record, I did consider leaving another comment that amounted to ""OP's so called 'therapist' should lose their fucking license"" but I didn't think it was a valuable contribution to the thread when there were a hundred other posts just like it.  I also didn't want to add any *more* pressure on OP, because people who've been victimised should not be made to feel responsible for their abusers ongoing shittiness, which is... maybe not something that was going to happen here, I have no way of knowing, but certainly a regularly occuring part of the narrative when people demand someone hold someone else accountable for something.

There's a reason my original comment was not in response to OP themselves."	qhbkhx	trans	2294	0.97	2021-10-28 01:20:38
Why do US military recruiters have to make people feel like shit?	"So I was in my high school class today, having a great day, and went to my favorite class to hang out with all of my friends during lunch. The people there always made me feel cared about, but today was a different story.

The guy that was there not only misgendered me (I'm passing as a male visually, but my voice isn't, so I think that's what gave me away, but I always brush it off that it's because I'm gay) but this guy decided to ruin my day.

He asked me if I had a car and a job, which I don't have either. I already have enough on my plate, my parents constantly shit on me for it, and every time I try to go to a driver's test, I end up havic panic attacks and being depressed about failing for weeks. I told him I didn't have either of these things, but I do have a job waiting for me to turn 18 in July that makes pretty good money. This guy took the liberty of sitting me down and mapping out my 'next ten years of life'. He said I was never going to get a car or hold a job, and I was going to drop out of college and never get my life together, allthewhile repeating how he makes 45k a month (most likely meant a year but he said a month)

I just feel like shit."	"Because making people feel like shit about their prospects makes them easier to pressure into enlisting, which is a recruiter’s goal. This was an entirely self serving angle, dude - to the extent you’re able, put it out of your mind cause he has pretty strong incentive to lie or at least tell a pretty biased story here…
Military recruiters 100% lie to you. Don't take any of what they say seriously in any way. If they come back ask this: if the military is so great and is really my only ticket to success like you say, then why are there so many homeless veterans? Why are there so many veterans who are poor, or dead, or severely disabled or mentally ill due to their experiences? Why are VA hospitals so bad? And why do you think you're getting paid so much to convince people to join? Obviously they wouldn't need to pay recruiters at all if it was so great bc everyone would already know how great it is.
A recruit making 45k a month? Lies. Dont take anything this person said to heart. They were full of shit.
Military recruiters will often outright lie to get people to enlist. They are vile, disgusting people.
When I mentioned my autism, a recruiter said that the military doesn't want a ""nutcase"". And this was before I knew I was trans.
45k/month LMAO. They either misspoke and meant to say per year, or more likely outright lied. Thatv would be 540k/year, the highest paid people in the military barely make 1/4 of that. Fuck military recruiters, they're the worst fucking people and will tell you any lie to her you to sign up and they'll stalk you and harass you if you even the tiniest but of interest. They should be banned from visiting high schools, but then they'd have trouble getting anyone to join if they can't target the most impressionable and easily misled populations.
Bad actors. Simply dni
It’s classism/other bigotry used as a weapon to try and coerce you into joining. Military recruiters have mastered the art of exploiting the marginalized with negging basically.
Take it from me, I'm 28 and am a transwoman. When I was 18 and on the verge of graduating from high school everyone asked me what my plans were. I was clueless! I wasn't accepted into a college, nor did I apply. I was working my first job at a grocery store. I was also living with my parents. I had loser written all over my forehead. 

I talked with recruiters from every military branch extensively but wasn't convinced. They prey on you at weak times in your life. I had a few friends that went in and they all disliked it. Looking back I'm so happy I didn't join.
>repeating how he makes 45k a month.

He's lying. That would mean he makes over $500k a year. That's more than the freaking President makes, let alone some random military recruiter. Shit, it's 3 times what the \*Chairman of the Joint Chiefs\* makes, and he's the highest ranking uniformed officer in the entire armed forces. It's also over double what the Secretary of Defense makes. 

>He said I was never going to get a car or hold a job, and I was going to drop out of college and never get my life together

He's saying this to make you feel desperate enough to want to join. The military is a shitty job that involves risking life and limb as well as your mental health, so in order to actually get enough people involved they \*need\* to lie somewhat. Otherwise why would they even \*need\* recruiters in the first place?

Also not for nothing, but if it means anything I got my license for the first time at 25 and only got my first car at 27. I didn't have my first official job until I was 21 (prior to that I just did dog walking and babysitting for the neighbors). I also got told I was horrible at math and would fail out of college as a physics major by my high school counselors. I'm now in the middle of my PhD in physics and have worked on the NASA perseverance mars probe, as well as worked with supercomputers.
Recruiter making 45k a year maybe, depending on rank.
I feel like it should just be illegal to have military recruiters in public schools, it's fucking disgusting... 

See if you can like, report them or something, because that's fucked...
What? Ur not even 18 and you’re supposed to have a CAR and a JOB? For what? That guy is an asshole.
A recruiter literally told me to join the Marines at 17 and lie about it to my parents for not wanting me to join he then would go on to say my mom's a idiot for not letting me join
Don't believe a word, most Recruiters are made to exhaust you until you join. If you have other options take his offer and block it outright. 

You can be happy anywhere you work, military ain't worth it.
Sounds about right for a recruiter.
I served in the Navy. Recruiters lie through their teeth. “45k a month.” What a joke. If he’s been in for a decade he might be making 45k a year. Even flag officers (admirals, generals), at the absolute most, make around 15k a month. Guy was full of shit
I heard my brother, who's in the military, say something about recruiters once.

He said that recruiters are 100% not your friend. You are a number on a piece of paper to them and nothing more. And the moment you have the option to either interact with them or don't, take the ""don't"" option.

He has a real hatred for recruiters and it's for this exact kind of stuff. Another thing he said was ""I felt more respected getting yelled at by my gunny than I ever did speaking to a recruiter.""
Don't let that troglodyte get to you, that was all just a manipulation tactic to try and get you to sign up and die for an oil company somewhere across the globe.
I had a friend who was JROTC and the marines let him do their recruiting all through high school knowing damn well he would never qualify with a particular medical condition and they didn't tell him until he aged out of JROTC and exploited his respect and love for the marines to recruit all the students who qualified. That loser outside of your school wasn't making 45k and they're lying to him just as much as he's lying to you.
Hahaha that slick sleeve fuck isn't making 45k a month. Not even on combat pay. Tell him this trans veteran said he's full of shit and to kick rocks, go talk to kids at the private school down the road.
Don't feel bad, military recruiters are professional liars who receive special training on how to manipulate people into signing their souls away to the armed forces.
I’ll map out your next 10 years in the military. Enlist, get shit on mentally and physically, possibly get sent to war, maybe die there maybe not, if you make it back probably end up committing suicide due to all the shit you’ve seen and the lack of support they give you once back. If none of those happen you also might just get disfigured and be on disability and not make shit the rest of your life.
Well you’re talking about recruiters. Recruiters will do that if it means another jar head. Hell they’ll be thrilled to hear what your favorite crayon is just to sell ya a time of discipline, college, and all kinds of ptsd. 

They’ll make ya feel like shit to sell the idea going to the military is the best thing ever since buttered toast. God bless those who serve but Christ these recruiters are desperate for able bodies.
Recruiters are so often they guys that didn't want to be active duty and move around but weren't good enough at anything to be given a basic job and are so volatile that nobody wants them around. Allegedly whatever branch they're in is can say a lot about them. Also 45k ain't shit. The only reason why he thinks it is, is probably that he has little to no expenses because of how the military does shit.
This guy definitely shouldn’t be a recruiter. Pls believe me when I say they aren’t all like this, same with soldiers in general. I’ve been enlisted for 3 years, I’ve met my fair share of bad but I’ve also met some of the most amazing people aswell
That sucks that happened to you, but Know that not everyone in the military is like that. Heck, trans people are twice as likely to serve than cis people.
Fuck that dude. Also I didn’t get my driver’s license until I was almost 29 because of driving anxiety and panic attacks. You’ll do what you need to do in your own time. There is no timer for these things ♥️
I had a lot to say about this, but it seems like most of my points were already talked about in the comments. Please don't let this guy get you down. He isn't worth the frustration. Ignore him and just know that if you do decide to join you by no means have to go to that specific recruiter.
Dude they’re the worst!! My school made me take the asvab 3? Maybe 4 years ago, AND TO THIS DAY THEY TEXT ME ASKING ME TO JOIN! I even told one of them I was trans at one point… just for the dude to text me a month later asking if I wanna join the amry
wow that guy sounds like a fucking loser lol
Wtf, he’s a pathetic dick with nothing else better to do than to shit on people who are having a better life than him.
Bloody hell that guy has to have the worst fucking numbers in the whole country if that’s how he talks to potential recruits and as a SSG(staff Sargent) he should know how to talk to people by now
honestly i've never let a military recruiter speak to me, they're basically a more dangerous version of telemarketers

anything they have to say to you should be cut off with the rudest sentiment you can think of
I had a similar experience. I had an army recruiter have the audacity to tell me to ""bump my GPA up""
Like wtf??? It's none of your business???
Just follow your own dream don’t listen to what other say about u
…did he follow this up with a pitch to join the military or was this done just for kicks?

Also, even if everything he said is his honest opinion, so what? He’s some random person. He’s not automatically right, and you have no obligation to care at all about what he thinks. It’s only so much noise and nothing actually to do with you, unless you choose to give his opinion any weight at all. Which you really, really don’t have to do. It’s your life, not his. He can stuff it.
Military recruiters seek to prey on vulnerable people, those who don't have other options or feel like they don't. If you see that recruiter again tell him that I said to fuck himself. He's like a pick up artist who is negging people so he can manipulate them to get what he wants. 

You are so much further ahead in your life than I was at your age! I didn't know I was trans until I was 30 and I just started transitioning at 34. I didn't get a job making 45K a year until I was 29. Your life is going to be awesome when you graduate, and I suspect you'll be a lot happier once you can afford your own place and clear your head of all the negative people in it. You are going to be kicking ass in life soon, hang in there!
He lies like a rug. Veteran here. I'm 37 transgender and deal with PTSD a significant portion of my hearing gone and a generalized anxiety disorder after 4 years. Tell you what though... I totally learned how to swallow my emotions and hide myself until I'm suicidal... So there's that. I was talking to someone who is a military recruiter at an event and he tried to recruit me to be an officer.... NOPE
He's really helping to uphold the military's outstanding reputation and def gonna recruit a lotta people with that lecture 😑 hope you're feeling better, OP!
Military recruiters are scum of the earth, don't listen to a word they say. If they try and talk to you get away as quickly as possible and refuse to talk to them.
If you know their names you can report them and considering the current military regulations they will get in trouble if you keep pushing.
You may feel like shit, and I'm sorry this happened to you, but a least you're not a lame military recruiter who harasses and annoys teenagers for a living.

You have a fantastic life ahead of you bro, don't let anyone else tell you how to live it, he knows nothing about your future.

It's his job to make you feel insecure and destitute with his shitty rhetoric while pretending that the military is some fantastic solution to personal and financial problems, as if they don't treat people as disposable. 

Anyway regardless of how successful you are or how long it takes you to get there; you'll always be better than that tool.
Military recruiters shouldn't be allowed into high schools. They misrepresent what they're offering to get naiive kids.
i fucking hate us military shitheads. and i can tell you right now, unless you are speaking to like the commander of a military they dont make 45k a month
Military recruiters are the lowest form of scum on this earth.
He's trying to recruit you man, it's shitty and nothing personal
What the actual heck is wrong with that guy?
Military recruiters are paid to lie. They should be met with comments of how weak they are and how they are just a cog in a machine and other anti military/antigovernment stuff. You have to make them angry so that they lose their cool.
Recruiters are the militaries salesmen. They have quotas to fill and they will bullshit you the entire way to fill them. Unless you have a very specific goal to accomplish in the military that you know you want, dont listen to a damn thing they say.
This dude absolutely does not make $45K/m as a recruiter, that’s more than $500K/year. Lyin ass
As an veteran Marine, I would advise you to lie to them exactly as they'd lie to you? Oh you make 45k a month? My dad's a CEO homie. Yes I have a car. I'll drive it up your ass if you don't stop talking to me. College is paid for. I bet they got you recruiting because you couldn't hack it in your original, very easy military job.
Rule #1 of dealing with military recruiters is to assume every word out of their mouths is a lie. They have quotas to hit and will say literally anything in order to hit them. 

Rule #2 is to always avoid military recruiters if possible.
Psh. He's screwing with you to coerce you into joining.

He's full of shit - fuck that guy. You got a good job coming? Take it and don't give that idiot a second thought.
I joined the military. Do not listen to a word they have to say. It isn’t worth it unless your only other option is homelessness. And then I’d still rather be homeless than go through the military again.
OP, if it makes you feel any better, for future reference you don't have to engage with him. He isn't your teacher, you don't have to let him sit you down and degrade you like that. He is a guest at the school. As a guest, he is bullying students to meet his quota. You should 100% report him to the school (and his superior if you feel like it) for these things he said to you, and refuse to interact with him again. Literally ignore him.
Either military creates assholes, or it draws in assholes. And why the fuck not, it's the military. It's not supposed to be accepting and peaceful. People who join the military (willingly) want to fight. They don't want to fight people like themselves, they want to fight people that are different. Doesn't sound like an inclusive and respectful disposition, does it?
I don’t know what type of recruiter you bumped into, but it definitely wasn’t mine.

Well, my Navy Recruiter, not sure about any others, really respected me and my transition. I later transitioned while inside of the Navy, and it really helped me.

Sorry about this experience, though! Some Recruiters really suck and just care about the bonus they get when they get someone to join.
military recruiters can be some of the most vile, manipulative assholes out there. he doesn't know shit about you. he has absolutely no place to judge you. plus he works for a military industrial complex whose main goal is profit and oil and somehow has the audacity to think he's better than you?

don't let him get to you. you're doing just fine.
What the fuck. Im not out at school so I present as male and the few interactions I’ve had with recruiters it just seemed like they were there because they had to be there. Most people at my school who are going to join the military are pretty open about wanting to join anyway so there isn’t much convincing involved.
Yo, this guy is playing you because it’s his job to get vulnerable kids to join the military. I almost joined because two years ago I was at an all time low. Pre transitioning. 

Luckily after destroying the new asvab without studying (got a 93) I relapsed on a bunch of drugs because I was insanely depressed and it put off my boot camp date. I went to rehab and did a 7 month treatment program where I came out during my 6th month in the program. 

I now have an amazing life. My recruiter called me about two months ago asking if I was still interested. I kindly told him I wasn’t and thanks for thinking of me. He then proceeded to tell me what he just told you. 

L O fucking L. 

I totally have my shit together and then some. I just bought a new Audi too. Don’t listen to that fucking creep. He’s a moron. And yes, I mean a literal moron. You don’t have to be a biochem major like me to not be a fucking idiot, and I doubt you are an idiot. But that guy, I guarantee you, is an idiot. 

Please have more self worth because you are at the very beginning of your life. I failed a million times before turning 27. I was successful at 20 years old, working in med research. At 23 I was a drug addict. At 25 I moved to Israel for a year and had an amazing time. At 26 I was at my lowest point. 

I’m 28 now and living my best life and very happy and very not broke. Life is soooooo weird, but it’s yours and you get to do whatever you want with it, so just be you and fuck that guy, he’s the idiot. And on top of that he’s immoral. 

Don’t worry you’ll be okay.
That’s manipulative as fuck, sorry that happened to you. Don’t listen to them. Honestly, fuck the military. I would just avoid talking to them if I were you (not sure how much that’s possible since where I live recruiters being in fucking schools is not a thing and seen as the dystopian shit it is (not saying it’s perfect here either this is just one less shitty thing here). Recruiters are predatory pieces of shit who try to manipulate teens into killing and dying for imperialism, fuck them)
It's totally possible that he does make $45,000 a month because he ruins so many lives berating people into joining the military.
A lot of people in the military are toxic. Point blank. I was a military spouse for almost a decade. I dated him in high school, was engaged to him during training, married him while he was active, divorcing now that he’s retiring. It depends on the leadership, but 9/10 or at least for his branch and his MOS, the leadership is shit and it is toxic for everyone. The guy I married was caring, not homophobic, even mentioned once he may be bi. He just got warped over time. It does that to people. So this guy was either born an asshole, the military made him one, or he was trying to scare you out of being in the military because it is not nice to LGBT+ 

But definitely an asshole
military recruiters job is to get you to join the military, and they will use any tactic they can to get that done.

&#x200B;

This guy seemed very full of himself and the military. If your really interested in military try to find another recruiter but I cant guarantee the next will be any better or worse. Game of luck.

&#x200B;

Also a lot of people on this sub hate the military but r/transalute is a great sub for trans folk that have that passion.
> how he makes 45k a month (most likely meant a year but he said a month)

Accept that not every recruiter is the sharpest tack in the box. There are ""tells"" like that which should, immediately, alert you, _""This person is not a reliable source of actionable information.""_

Sorry you're feeling like shit. 

A lot of the recruiters are simply trying to play a numbers game, and they're under pressure from higher up to ""just get recruits"". 

The sales tactics they use are not always the most effective. Often they're scare tactics too. 

There is a _reason_ why the ""jarhead"" stereotypes exist. Recruiters will often get the most gullible and scared to sign-up. Again, many/most recruiters do not see you as a person first. They see you as a quote number first and a person second. That's and important difference.

Also, a few salient points, for clarity:

1. Military service can 100% a fulfilling and valuable career for many. But not for all.

2. Military service is a hard job and a hard career.

3a. You can not trust anything your recruiter tells you. Period. Why? Once you sign, all those promises are unenforceable. To believe otherwise is naïve. (I'd also like to sell you a bridge.)

3b. Again, you can not trust what your recruiter tells you. A good recruiter will give you resources to independently verify everything they tell you. A middling or bad recruiter will lean too heavily on ""trust me"" without understanding the nature of trust. (i.e. Trust, but verify.)

4. A good recruiter, while rare, is absolute gold. 

Sorry you got one of the not so great ones.
Military stuff is all over my school. but it’s because our school is named after a military guy from our town who died in Vietnam, stepped on a grenade or something idk.
If you want to serve your community then become an EMT or volunteer with the fire department. You will actually be helping people. Then go back to school and make more than this asshole
Because the U.S. military is awful tbh, tons of imperialists that have the blood of babies on their hands. Chelsea Manning isn't famous for the U.S. military being reasonable to her when she shared some of the atrocities perpetuated. Shit, Apocalypse Now is a pretty old film showing it even, the military is fucked.
Fuck the US and their military and their recruitment means
My BIL was in the army and it made my sister's and his life hellish. Recruiters have to lie and manipulate to get people to join. That includes being super shitty when they think it will make you feel like you need to do ""better"". It sucks. I'm sorry that happened to you. Even knowing why they do it doesn't make all the pain of the interaction go away.
Don’t take it personally they are nearly always condescending and trying to to ego/bully teenagers into service, which is disgusting
Would have been worse if he tried to falsely encouraged you with lies about how great the army is for trans people. It’s a mixed bag at best but you have other options and should feel good about your future not pressed into being a drone.
Standard practice is to give the finger to any and all military recruiters and move on with your day.
Turns out being a lying asshole makes you a perfect army recruiter, no surprise here.
The idea of military recruiters being allowed in schools at all is insane. They're there to get you to literally sign your life away so they will do whatever it takes. Try to pay them no mind.
I'm so sorry that they treated you like that. I'm in the military if you could send me the name rank and branch of that recruiter I would ""love"" to have a conversation with them.
Fuck the us military. And I think it’s horrible people have to sacrifice their lives/bodies for education, medical, et al.
Military recruiters are bullies, their goal is to break you down and make you feel insignificant and small without the military. They want the military to feel like a necessity to succeed. It's why they don't mention veteran homeless rates, PTSD rates, and how poorly the VA services the veterans. 

I'm proud that you have a job lined up for you when you turn 18. I had severe anxiety around driving cars as well and it took me until I was 22ish to find a teacher that made me comfortable and gave me the tools to deal with my anxiety on the road. We all have different paths.
So much military apologia from people who can't separate a systemic criticism from a personal one. No one is mad at you specifically for signing up. We're mad at the system that put you in that position in the first place.
Dude you're in highschool. Most don't have a job or a car. That guy was just being a dick to pressure you into enlisting. If you see him again tell him, ""Nah I'm not currently employed, but I'm currently weighing my options against going to college or enlisting so I can sit around a highschool and make teenagers feel like crap about themselves for 45k a year.""
Recruiters are liars and snakes, especially the army. They will say amd do anything to convince you that you have to join. Put absolutley zero weight in what they say dude. They want to make you feel useless and not worth anything else, that's hoe the got me. 

Anyone reading this, unless you're an awful, irredeemable person, do not join the army. Because that's most of what they have in there. I'm 0% surprised they'd try and make a child feel bad about himself to join, but it still burns me up.
That’s the sales pitch, my lad. 
You suck, and only X can fix you. He’s just trying to manipulate you. Tell him you’re a kid, and he needs to fuck off.
Both of my best friends were manipulated into joining the military by recruiters. Poached right out of high-school. Don't believe shit they say bc they will say LITERALLY anything to get you to join. So sorry that you had to deal with that
Try not to take it personally, everything they say is just a bunch of scare tactics to manipulate you into selling yourself to the military, don’t buy into it, you’re young lots if not most people your age don’t have those things you’re doing just fine!!
Ignore them, they're paid to hurt you
They do that so you will feel pressured to join up. So you know what i say? PROVE HIM WRONG! You can do it fuck that guy!!
Change my mind anyone who is a military recruiter is an awful fucking person
Seriously?!?! A military recruiter makes 45k in A MONTH?!?! That guy was just being a total dick for no reason. There's no way in hell anybody in the military makes 45k a month 😐 thats half a million dollars a year! I recently had a really really good job and the most I'd make a month was 6 grand, I guarantee without a shadow of a doubt that I was making more than him or anyone he knew lol. Military recruiters are the trash of the Military. They don't do shit except convince people to get paid by signing up to die if asked to. If I was a Military recruiter I'd probably hate myself. If anything he's jealous because here's a highschool kid who had the courage to do what makes him happy regardless of what his peers may think while he(the Military recruiter) is stuck in a shitty ass dead end job getting ppl to sign their lives over by lying his ass off.
Military recruiters are disgusting. Just tell them you fucked their wife while they were on deployment. Works every time.
>45k a month

45k Russian Rubles maybe. ($543.81 USD)
The military: Come be a badass, and watch Jimmy die 5 minutes into his first deployment. Why is the military aloud to use such blatant lies. Oh I know because the US is run by warmongers that don't care about anything but them selves.
100% every word is part of a larger sales tactic. His words might be true as in they truly represent the thoughts and sentiments of people who are in a mindset like his, but that’s the level of truth his words offer. The real question is whether you choose to believe in this picture that he’s painting you
dont give him the time of day. classic appeal to fear, but if you just join the military they can keep you safe and secure! total bs and honestly borderline cult behavior there. your emotions are valid but they dont control you, please remind your brain that they're full of nonsense!
a big fat liar. there's zero way to know what the next ten years hold, let alone some jerk who's desperately trying to sign you up to the MurderBoysInc

you have a job lined up, and depending on where you live you dont even need to drive.

my life from 18-28 includes some real dark and low times, and you know what would have helped? not the fucking military, but some self awareness and coming out as trans lol
You already seem to know it in your heart, but I'll say it loud: FUCK. THAT. GUY. They're just high on themselves and trying to make you feel bad to get some kind of weird sadistic satisfaction. Don't let it get to you! 

Those words were empty, baseless, and just plain rude. No one has the answers to how your life will go. It's yet to be lived. Love yourself, forget that guy, and keep on trucking. You're awesome! 💜
Don’t listen to him. Him and everyone else in the military are deluded thinking they’re fighting for freedom when really it’s blood and oil. And they’re mostly assholes AND he’s literally wrong about your life. He can’t know the future. so don’t worry about his shit opinion. Do you dude!
yeah hes fucking lying to you

you already have a job lined up, so immediately hes wrong. you have a job already.

just fuck him, punch him next time you see him.
Don't listen to them.  They're trained to lie to people and manipulate them into joining the army.   They go into high schools to manipulate kids into joining. Their job is literally doing exactly what he did and make people feel shitty enough to where they think they ""have"" to join the army.
What a jerk. Get him fired if possible.
the military and its recruiters are pigs and morons. dont let them get to you.
[removed]
If you care about trans people other than yourself don't join the military.
I don't understand. He made a sales pitch and offered you a job. You said no. What's the issue?
I’m so sure that twat makes 45k a month 🙄
Piece of advice to all: immediately tell military recruiters you have asthma, they stop pushing right away because you literally can’t join the military with it. Worked for me a couple times lol
I was in the Navy and I was part of the delayed entry program. The main thing to remember is that until you sign your paperwork and get sworn in you are not in the military. That is something recruiters will lie to you about. They have to monitor you while you are in a delayed entry program and they want to make sure you make to boot camp. If you don’t it counts against them. You can at anytime up to the moment you sign your paper work say I want to leave. You might have to find your own way home, but you can seriously do that.
If it makes you feel any better they don’t stop treating you like shit after you enlist. They’re trying to make it sound like this is your only way of achieving success but your risk of chronic and disabling mental and physical health issues goes up with military service so they’re really not opening your life up to better opportunities. Don’t stress about the driver’s test failures. Plenty of people fail their test and getting out from under your parents will improve your mental health and make it easier to get a driver’s license. When you’re dealing with a ton of stress in your life, your base anxiety level is higher and that makes it more likely you’ll have a panic attack.
damn what a jerk! ignore him, you're 100x better than him and a way better person! i wish you the best with your job :)
The recruiter lied to em said I dint have to run….. Army said no. Though Amry dose have a decent Tran program and Group therapy to help with transition. Is it worth join the Amry no run as fast as you can away from it. But from someone who was tricked and trying to crawl out of hell it’s not 100% bad just 75% bad
Honestly it is absolutely wild sitting here in a different country (one that is actually VERY similar to the US) and the idea of this happening here is off the charts bonkers. Like... crazy that this sort of thing has been so normalized for you. I am so damn sorry for you bb. you do NOT deserve this shit... no one does to be honest.

EDIT: also, just to reassure you... Found my career at 28, got my license at 30, found my forever person at  31... you ain't trying to beat the clock. you have all the time int he world bb.
Hey if you can PM me this recruiter's name or at least the office you think he belonged to I can send a nice message to their supervisor (I'm in the service) about how not to be an asshole to the public :)
Just don't talk to these predatory pieces of shit. Whatever you do, don't enlist.
Military recruitment like that should be illegal
These people are assholes. They are trying to sell you into joining the Army, and don't care about you at all. For what it's worth, they aren't trying to personally attack you. They have a script for high school kids. They try to bring everyone down so that they can make the military look better.

It's a shady sales tactic that they do on teenagers and they should be ashamed for it.
Why is there a military recruiter at your school?
I got this same treatment without any assessment of my personality or skills (pretty far past high school, but they show up on college campuses too). ""Don't you want a chance to feel proud of yourself and a better life?"" They backed waaay the fuck off when I told them I'm disabled and in law school. It's NOT about you. They attempt to recruit anything with a pulse by aggressive negging. And honey, you're too good for them anyways.
Well I haven't spoke to a recruiter yet, but one will speak with me soon 
That's weird how that recuiter was being rude, some adults are weird man, sorry about that

Actually, today a teacher told me ""*misgenders* you can get lost in a square"" (calling me dumb) and that hit because in elementary I was told I need to be with the special ed because I was an introvert, and generally I don't really act or feel smart but that's because I act stupid but I know I'm clever I just don't work on it. That adult should've thought before talking like I just don't understand eighter, but the US miltary is tough
I don't want to necessarily equate them bc I think a lot of these people are truly ignorant and think they're doing the right thing because of American propaganda but these dudes are like legit grooming kids with these things during high school.
On one hand treated like everyone else on the other hand bad career choice. How do I know, you ask?  I’ll send you a pic of over 24 meds i take a day. There’s always another way. Also recruiters lie never, ever forget that.
Basic pick up tactic. He knows that you have something to prove so he's breaking you down. Don't worry about it. Seeking his approval is like climbing a giant pile of shit.
This is another reason why schools need to be financially gutted more. Allowing domestic terrorist recruiters to lie to children to sacrifice their lives and youth to die for muriKKKa.
Sadly, it's a tactic they use. Make potential recruits feel like shit and like they have no other options. That's also why you'll see them more in what is labeled ""underfunded"" or ""poor"" schools/areas.  


Anyways, main point, I'm sorry you had to go through that. It's stupid and predatory and a despicable practice on their part.
Recruiters are awful. Even people in the military hate them. Former recruiters hate that they were them.
College dropout here making ~90k - fuck that dude’s bullshit. 
They don’t know you or your future. 
Try not to let some rando psyche you out and just keep doing you
Because nobody signs up to go halfway around the world and get shot at when they feel like they've got other options.
> This guy took the liberty of sitting me down

**THAT** was your first mistake. It doesn't matter how much someone pretends to have authority over you, unless they are a cop with actual probable cause to believe you committed a crime, **NEVER** let someone else have control of the situation. It doesn't matter that they are older. It doesn't matter if they are bigger. If they are going to use their size to keep you from walking away... they have committed kidnapping.

If you have to: Scream that you are being raped. Doesn't matter if you are male, female, or utterly genderless. Screaming ""Rape!"" At the top of your lungs is a legitimate recourse if someone is trying to keep you from getting away from them.
He makes 45k a month? 

Fuck healthcare, I'm coming to the States baby
What city? Because no way he makes 45k a month. I know because I just got out of the military and i made like 6500 at most a month and that was juking the system. So no way he was making that much, also fuck that recruiter. I've made a bunch of friends in the military who were gay and they were amazing people! Miss them! So hope you have a good day and good luck on your test! If you ever join, go air force though, easiest branch and you get to get stationed in so many different places, unlike the Marines
You can make more than that, just pay attention at school, study, and don't listen to that fuckwit.

Don't sweat your driver's license. Just keep going until you pass. You're bound to one of these times. I passed earlier this year, and I'm turning 23 in May. Just stop thinking of it like each test is the crucial one, just do your best and if you don't get it this time, you'll get the next one. And yeah, that might not be technically true, but it's a good mentality to have going in, because you can't let the disappointment get you down.
Like it can be fun if you are in to that hard core lifestyle now airforce officer there's a possibility of not needing a knee replacement at 30 and actually making money but similar shit different pile.  
I had a recruiter try to get me to be MP or Combat engineer. I knew they do cool stuff with C4 and MP  don't really know cop stuff to army guys? sounds like a really fist fighting job. But i looked at him and looked at my arms ""do i look like a combat engineer or MP material?""  but your guy was a dick. There are a ton of rewarding careers out there and some can make  money.  I launch balloons for a living and teacher thought watching clouds out the window would not land me a job but i get payed for guessing what those clouds are going to do next, there are cool jobs out there but working with that ass hole is probably not one of them..
At this point whenever I get emails/texts from them at my school I wast their time by saying I don’t have legs and since I replied I think they are have to awkwardly reply.
I fucking hate the military. I was heavily pressured to join and essentially gaslighted by my parents to join (this was before I knew I was trans) I was also super conservative at this time but by the gods do I regret it. The military sucks and does nothing for this countries benefits
Not only is this person being an asshole, you're under zero obligation to be polite to this asshole. He interrupted your lunch, some of the few moments of peace you get during the day. You owe him NOTHING. And you especially don't owe him any personal details about your life. Next time he comes around, just ignore him. Pretend you literally don't hear him and don't make eye contact. He'll move on quickly.
I'm just sitting here wondering how the hell are military recruiters allowed in schools?? US is really a shithole :/ I'm sorry that this happened to you :(
This is a well known technique in obedience.

Stanley Milgram found that people were more likely to be obedient if you make them feel incompetent.

If someone is belittling you.  Its probably because they are trying to control you.
Makes sense that someone recruiting for a terrorist org would be a pos
I got my driver's license when I was 22. There is no shame in taking a while to reach certain goals. Military recruiters are just assholes.
The recruiter sounds like a jerk. (Probably his job) Don’t listen to him, and I hope you have a better day tomorrow
So if you want a little push back, depending on their rank(count the chevrons more means higher rank) report them to the school. If it’s airforce, and the dude was low rank he was on a program called rap, essentially going back to your home town after basic and tech school. It’s something you can repeat, but only with the recruiters recommendation. If he gets negative feed back it’s not going to work out well for him. Higher rank, and or other branches(I don’t know enough about them to have input) tell the school. All recruiting stations have goals per quarter for number of recruiters, and they live and die by making them selves known at schools. If you can convince the school it’s a liability to let them have super free access to campus they will suffer. 

There’s options when you’re in for dealing with those kinds of people, and I’m deeply apologetic that you’ve met one of the used car dealer types. Everyone, and I mean everyone gets training on inclusion, and diversity at least airforce side. 

If you want more information on how to push back against shitty recruiters at your school just ask. there are a couple programs. Such as the inspector general that will take complaints from the public. Or just going to their boss tbh.
Report him. straight up. Recruiters shouldn't be doing that period, and I'm assuming he is just an E-5 sgt that doesn't know that he is A) a recruiter, so he doesn't do shit during wartime B) is a terrible salesman C) has no right to judge anybody considering he is a fkn recruiter.

For everyone who thinks recruiters are there to prey on people. Well yes and no. Shit I'm talking with one rn about going through a year and some change of paperwork with me which she does NOT have to do or frankly should deal with because she wants to help me with my actual career (I'm already enlisted) And prior to that I had another wonderful experience with my first recruiter who pushed me to go for a better job so I'd have a better experience in the military. 

Some are gonna be shit. This guy definitely is but if he made you feel uncomfortable in a capacity that was belittling or otherwise, file an EO (equal opportunity) complaint. I don't want to throw anybody under the bus but that is unbecoming of an NCO and I'm sick of seeing complaints like this about the military. (not the fact that you're complaining but the fact that a complaint exists in the first place because if theres a complaint that is warranted then there is a huge problem. and i think someone even mentioning or bragging about their pay makes it a warranted problem.)

BTW. Test anxiety sucks, but what helps me is just thinking that you don't know what you dont know and thats okay you can do it again or learn from it. Don't trip
Because they can only get people to join when they don’t value or care about themselves. I know it’s hard, but don’t pay any attention to them
There’s nothing stopping you telling him why he ain’t shit and making a plan to salvage his garbage life.
45k a year now adays is shit
He’s manipulating you. Don’t fall for it. You’d rather work and McDonalds for 4-5 years than give your freedom away to the military. Its basically like signing up for jail except you get paid for it and you could be sent to die.
Unfortunately that's their job to manipulate and deceive you to get you to join them. I told one I was going to a Christian college to study art, and he told me it was God's will for me to join the military. Like he could even know that. I would be garbage as a soldier. I am a piece of cotton candy.

Like Badflower's ""Machine Gun"" says: ""This is how the world ends. This is how they suck you in: manipulate the broken, suffer every consequence.""

I'm sorry they said that crap to you. You're amazing and bright and have a wonderful future ahead of you! Whatever your dreams are, you WILL accomplish them because you are strong!
The affect of big government is HUGE … it’s why I refuse to vote for either mainstream party… and I receive hate no matter what I do tbh
Their job is to make you feel like shit so joining the military seems like a better deal than it is.
Holmie, you’re still in high school and have a whole lifetime of experiences to live. Military recruiters, IMO, use fear tactics like this to get you to enlist. Honestly not driving a car can be a hindrance but it’s not the end of the world. Holmie, you’re in high school, you don’t necessarily need a job. Focus on school and get the best grades and live your life. I didn’t get my first job till after high school so don’t let it get you down. Give yourself some compassion and empathy, you’re still learning and growing. If you really want a license you’ll find a way to get it, if not that’s fine. When the right time comes you’ll find a job as well. I hope this brings some solace in your time of need
Because they need people to feel weaker and powerless so they’re easier to prey on and enlist. It’s very manipulative. It’s okay if you don’t learn to drive now, there’s public transport and you’re not even legally an adult yet. You have so much time to work out what you want to do for yourself rather than this warped manipulative point of view.
Making someone feel like shit is entirely how someone made him join up. He’s trying it with you too.

The idea is to make you feel like you have no other choice. You have that job, you have your college and you have your identity. Don’t let him take any of those things away from you! They’re not his to take!
I had a Coast Guard Recruiter tell me to “quite trying to get in” because I Have Autism and Anxiety 🥲

They really do know how to make you feel horrible.

I just wanted to be able to go to college 🥲🥲
Imperialism
Yes, that's their job
Listen to the Song ""youre in the army now"". It sums the entire mess up pretty well. God im sorry for you.
Shoot... 
If you're not even 18 you're fine.

Especially if you're still in school.

There's a very select few jobs students can get.
And being unser 18 typically means you don't have much job experience to fall back on for both reference of the employer, and your own ease of confidence. 

There are billions of people in this world all managing to make it some way or another. Some of them are total blockheads. If they can make it, you'll be alright. Don't cut yourself short, just do your best and if you can do anything to keep from panicking you'll find you're not nearly that bad once you get to start experiencing the people who come after you.
Honestly? They tried doing that bs to me (from a long family of military service) and I told them to sit and spin. Mind you this was the 90s, but I knew how much smoke they were blowing.

You can tell them to walk btw. If they don't, report them to the school.
Recruiters are human trash trust me my mom is dating one
The chances of you not being able to get a car is probably the highest chance thing of happening but I know you can do that, I can say without a doubt you can hold down a job, you're a strong dude! Also if you do go to college you're almost definitely do just fine, don't listen to that low life that doesn't give 2 fucks about your feelings and only cares about recruiting people
You‘re in high school, why do you need a job or car??? Is this an american thing?
Why would you have a job an a car? You are a teenager for god sake!
Sounds like a lie and attempt at brainwashing and fear mongering lol
Thats part of their job i think
Because military recruiters are just as much parasitic as landlords, but unlike a landlord who is given control over the dynamic from day 1, the recruiter has to win it and an easy way to do so is to try and break people down
wtf?? i thought some military people were already too harsh, this is on another level.
Fear is an effective manipulator.  His job is to make you feel like your only chance at success is the military.  Don’t worry, he’s got plenty of his own issues - which is why he is where he is, making you feel little - to make himself feel big.  The fact that you are strong enough to be yourself is proof that you are much stronger than he is.
I've been in for 15 years. My advice is to talk to a friend or family member that serves before joining. Have them come with you as well.
There are honest recruiters out there, and then there's recruiters that only see numbers.
So this must be an area thing because my recruiter always fixes him self when talking to me and the guy is from texas. So the one at your school must just be a dick. And before you go oh he is just wanting me to join, I wanted to join and signed papers before I told him. And from what I hear I am the first trans person that the recruiting station has seen.
The military is built off of predatory manipulation. They'll bash you down, make you feel hopeless, then bring you a shining new job opportunity to ""fix"" all those problems they just bashed you for.
Because people are evil and people in the army love being mentally and psychically abusive. You did nothing wrong. HE should feel like shit.
I have tried and true response to recruiters, as a broad shouldered, kinda built looking ""dude"".

""I'm not about go fight and die for a giant fucking oil company, suck my ass.""
Recruiters lie constantly and they do it because lying to poor kids is their entire business model - get them in, pay them shit for putting their lives in danger, drop their college support at the slightest opportunity, and leave them with medical problems, PTSD, and deeply inadequate healthcare. He wants you to develop PTSD for $22k a year and he wants you to think that's your best option. 

I got paid more than that to go to grad school, fuck! These bastards don't give a flying fuck about you and they will lie and abuse you all through your time in the military and they'll literally trauma bond by saying you did so well at enduring the abuse, and they start with high school kids.

It's just institutionalized abuse, and it works because it preys on your emotions exactly like this guy did. If you can get ANY job you're better off taking it than joining the military would be.
This 100% ugh I hate assholes like this!
My Grandpa- a Navy Vet- has told me multiple time to NEVER go through a Recruiter. He said if I was interested in a branch Contact them myself (via website or whatever). 

So if a vet says don’t listen to the recruiters idk what to tell you lol.
Yeah, consider that part or all oh his bias may be that a government that profits from killing people, by making weapons to kill people through the military industrial complex, and steal other's natural resources, or install a right-wing government in countries they want good tax deals when invasion looks unfavorable... is paying his checks, so verbal abuse & manipulation isn't strictly gendered necessarily. Still could be gendered, I wasn't there to get the vibes.    

But imagine how disposable a transgender troop is to our state? Transgender cannon fodder.     
Hard to see why even a democrat ran government would not turn out that way.
Bingo, it's a well designed scam.
I would hope that would shut them the fuck up REAL fast
the amount the US military has to pay  it;s recruiters  says it all    


in developed world countires , yes  they have to opt in for consideration to be recruiter but it;s paid he same as the rank  they are
Have you seen their ads on YouTube? They literally try to advertise that being in the military is like playing a video game. Once I even saw them advertise it as “paid leave from parenting” 😬
Recruiters suck, they have to make quota.  VA hospitals are bad because veterans aren't loved as much as all the bs advertising would make you think Dead and disabled because the people elected to office by you (or your parents) wanted to play general somewhere.  Mentally ill and addicts are everywhere (these are the homeless vets).  $4500 a month.   Military isn't great, can suck bad, but it is a way to get a step up if you need it.  Probably get flamed or ignored, nbd, just wanted to say be easy on some of the vets, military may have been their only way out and up.
When I was in high school we had a recruiter stop in for shop class and basically give their recruiter talk. I brought up a lot of the points made here and how even though my mom was in the army she never received any financial aid for education or healthcare and was effectively left in the dirt. I also brought up how at any given point there are roughly 45k homeless veterans many of which end up sadly taking their own life. I also brought up how most people have been severely traumatized after their service in the military and how that is incredibly stigmatized so many people go without help.

Her response was basically that I was nothing more than a troubled child and I would amount to nothing. She accused my mom of being a failure and a drunk and started saying some really nasty things about me and my family (keep in mind Ive never met this woman before). After she was done berating me she started going on about the “many wonderful benefits of the military”. I cut her off about halfway through asking if she already forgot everything I said or if she just enjoys lying to kids. She told me to “go to hell and keep your mouth shut”. 

So basically if you want to know who recruiters are as people just say one very accurate problem and see how committed to their lie they are (they will never back down because they make money based off how many people they recruit).
Army vet here. Recruiters 100% lie. I went in the office with a mohawk at the age of 25 and let them do their talk, they filled me with the lies they tell high schoolers, I told them I knew it was all bullshit anyway but needed a way out of town and was aware of the gamble I was placing. I scored high, got a gig, did 5 years, and am effectively making more than double on the outside what that recruiter bragged about making while renting his soul to the big green weenie.

Ranks achieved past an initial enlistment are largely filled with incompetence. There's plenty that are in it for the mission and actually care (which is honorable in a sense), but the intelligent and natural leaders leave because the culture is so shit and there's better $ to be made elsewhere with much less bullshit to deal with. 

""You'll never make it in the civilian world. no one's hiring. no one wants to deal with [insert projections here]."" -Some dude that enlisted out of high school (25 years ago)
Pretty much every man in my dad’s family has served in the military, and they all were treated like shit. My dad just won his case this year to receive the benefits he’s entitled to over *20 years* after he left the service. For my grandfather, it was about twice as long. The military will do everything in its power to screw you over as much as is legally (or illegally) possible.
I think the recruiter would drop and do 100 push-ups if you said that.
This isn’t exactly true. There are some recruiters that actually lay things out for you, and aren’t complete assholes just trying to meet their quota. Please do some research.
Yeah, that's 3 times what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs makes, over twice as much as the Secretary of Defense makes, and over 30% more than the President makes.

It's an \*absurd\* amount of money for a government salary and complete BS. It sounds like they're counting on high schoolers to not know any better.

Heck, it's an absurd amount of money for the private sector. My brother works in corporate finance and he doesn't make even a quarter of that much.
It's a ""tell"". 

Recruiters often lie. But they are also often ""that dumb"" to not realize their own inconsistencies. Either way, if the do one or the other, they're full of shit.

Good recruiters? They actually do exist. I've met a few. What makes them good? Fundamentally, they understand they're operating within a civilian sales model with civilian sales process expectations. Totally changes the tone.

There is no need to use high-pressure, used-car-salesman, boiler-room sales tactics if you have a quality product to sell. 

You know what happens when a recruiter's entire identity is built upon their military service?...They have a lot of trouble interacting with anyone else's who isn't. Same is true for anyone with a fragile identity, honestly. Maybe this sub just has a really good nose sniffing it out.
I wonder if they're doing the same thing scam artists do when they make their emails super obvious. Tell a lie that only an idiot will believe, and you can recruit only idiots.
I was in the military and yeah dont talk to the recruiters

Everyone in the military dislikes them because they get so desperate to hit quotas that they will do or say anything
It really depends. Some are truly there to help because they're good heart individuals. Others that are more career oriented, only care about the numbers. The recruiter listed above though, is a downright cunt.
As a fellow autistic person, I would have asked them why the military accepted him if they don't want nutcases
jesus tapdancing christ, I'm so sorry they said that to you. Sounds like they didn't even know what autism is, as I'm pretty sure you can be autistic and join the military. God what an arsehole. 

 In any case, it's going INTO the military that can make someone a ""nutcase"", from my experience.
Bullet dodged
Feels like the sort of thing that should make them lose that job.
Least evil US soldier
Yeah, he tried to get my friend to give me his number to try and convince me to join
> It’s classism/other bigotry used as a weapon to try and coerce you into joining.

I am suddenly reminded of >!Power of the Dog!<. -M
Maybe he meant to say 4.5 K and not 45 K ???
Apparently he runs a section of infantry
If married lol
Don't they get a bonus for every one they convince to sign up?
Like I don't remember having any military anything in schools, both primary and secondary or college when I was in education here in England. 

The fact that in presumably the US they have recruiters in school/college is a big warning sign in of itself. Catch them while they're young, not sure on what to do next in life, sounds like easy targets for rectuiters to me.
ive wanted to report those assholes. i hate us militants so much
It won't go anywhere because the military is the most powerful and lucrative institution in the country. The schools want them there
Because nothing says ""be a rebel"" more than joining an organization where Uniformity is almost literally worshipped
He's been in for two years. Said he joined in 2020
I was in JTOTC past year, I feel that. We had a recruiter every other week. Glad I left, they were making me wear the female uniform.
Well, that’s a little mean. Most people do their bid, don’t see/do shit, spend four+ years bored as fuck and basically doing nothing but cleaning chores, housework, and shitty group exercise, then get out and go on to actually live a normal life after. It’s pretty much a place for most people to waste a few years to get benefits that maybe give them a shot at what people who are better off have without signing up.

Only about 10% of the Army is in combat arms, last time I checked, so boredom and being infantilized for your entire bid is more common than seeing a bunch of horrible shit and combat.
I don't know how it works for other branches, but this is how it worked in the marines. Basically, if you want to reach a certain rank instead of staying 'middle-rung' forever, you have to do a B-billet. Options are a few years of being a drill instructor or similar position, coach on the rifle range, or recruiter. So the ones who picked recruiter usually didn't meet (or didn't want to meet) the requirements for the other options.
I also just looked back and realized that he claimed it was 45k a month not a year in the post. And there is absolutely no way in hell that he'd be making 45k a month to be a recruiter. 45k a year is roughly  the average if not a little generous for someone as low on the totem pole as a recruiter.
There were 40 people in my boot camp platoon. So far, at least 3 of us are out as trans. And that's just from the few people I was able to somewhat keep in touch with, the actual number might be larger. So I do think you might be onto something here.
I feel you man. I barely escaped another recruiter. I was in JROTC and the class had to put our numbers down for him to go through each one of us and talk to us about joining. This is a different guy than the one I'm talking about above btw. He doesn't know I'm trans, but it's not nice just to get my full deadname texted to me every now and then because he doesn't like being ignored.
He left right after, but his pitch was before he started going at me
That's actually the job I have waiting for me. I've got an open spot waiting on me in the fire department thanks to family connections
45k a month is ridiculous, that's officer pay, like O7 or O8 officer pay. However 6 grand a month is quite doable as an enlisted. When I got out as an E-5 I was taking home ~5k a month, and getting refunds of about a grand on my taxes. And if I'd stuck around I'd probably be an E-7 by now taking home arround 6.5k a month. 

The thing about military pay is that base pay is maybe half the story. Base pay is shit, but when you add in tax free benefits such as COLA (cost of living adjustment, available at select duty stations), BAH (Basic allowance housing, set a specific rate for each area, and it increases with rank, and number of dependents), BAS (Basic allowance substance, set rate to cover food if you can't eat at the galley), and miscellaneous other benefits such as actually free healthcare, if deployed or doing some odd things, combat pay, hazardous duty pay, special duty pay, etc... not to mention everything that isn't base pay being tax free, you can live quite comfortably. 

Of course there are downsides, my deployment messed me up, I was diagnosed with gender dysphoria a week after Trump's no trans folks in the military  tweet, all kinds of irritating bureaucracies, etc...

But hey, at least I got a house and free college when I want it out of the whole deal.
Getting military personnel fired is basically impossible. Unless we pop for drugs, do something really illegal, or disobey orders, no one is getting fired.
Ohhh nooo suddenly I care about your opinion
…the issue is that he decided to tell a kid that they’ll amount to nothing? All because they said they’re not interested in turning brown kids into skeletons.
Yeah nothing wrong with coercing children to signing up to potentially be killed in a pointless geopolitical conflict
this is exactly why I effing hate the military
That’s nonsense. The military pays relatively well, will give you education opportunities while enlisted (TA is kinda a mess, but it’s still thousands in free assistance towards earning undergraduate credits), will teach you a skill, give you subsidized housing, and provide you with free healthcare.

For a lot of people it’s literally your best option. If you’re not going to college and don’t have some sort of trade in mind, the military really is a very good choice. Hell, even if you are going to college, you should still consider if ROTC would be in your interest. 

Millions of directionless people have been given a purpose and structure by joining the military. In a lot of ways it’s the closest thing america has to a comprehensive set of social programs.
>Has told me multiple time to NEVER go through a Recruiter.

You cannot join the military without talking to a recruiter. If you go to the website then they will direct you to a recruiter near you.
In a lot of developed countries though, service is mandatory. It'd be crazy how pissed people would get in the US if they suddenly made it the law you have to serve when you're 18 for 1 year or something.

The recruiters in the US have pretty big boots to fill in that respect
it's really, really fucked up to me that they try to honestly sell to highschool students how ""exciting"" killing other human beings is.
Huh, I'm not american but i keep getting YouTube ads from the ""Canadian armed forces"" trying to stress how ""woke"", ""progressive"", ""diverse"", and how ""girl power"" they are.

  


Not sure which is more nauseating
I understand how that can be the case for some people; pretty much every man in my family since they came to America in the 1900s has been in the military. That line ends with me bc I saw what that did to them.
No one was saying anything bad about veterans. We were talking about the fucked up system they get put through.
Ironically the military is our biggest socialist program
Fr, my dad came from dirt farmer roots and the military got him to solid middle class. I joined because when I graduated high school the US was in a recession and I was already used to the lifestyle. Years later I would have been homeless but the VA’s homeless vets program has helped me, *plus* I discovered their health program includes gender therapy where no I got the real official “yes this is real official gender dysphoria”. 

For some folks it’s a very good fit. I hope everyone finds a good fit with as little suffering as possible 💜🙏
Well yeah they want to get people young and unknowledgeable. Then when they get in and find out its a lie its too late. Locked in for 4 years or whatever it is
That given, assuming he meant 45k a year.....is that impressive? That seems fairly below average
I mean, in the US ""to help"" the army is mostly to assist imperialism for oil and stuff. Still a bad choice of career.
100% report him for that
That would be about $54k a year which is a lot more believable, but then again he could have also meant to say $45k a year, or OP misheard him.

Recruiter median salary is $43k a year so either case is believable.

That said...its still misleading to a kid who doesn't know exactly how far that goes in the modern economy and what that will or won't buy.
I can say this as ex military, no one in the military rank structure makes 45k a month.
If he said 45k a month, he's still lying. 45k a month is over double what the secretary of defense makes, 3 times what the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs makes (Highest ranking general/admiral in the entire military), and over 30% more than the President makes. There's no way in hell he makes that much monthly.

45k a \*year\* is believable if he's a senior enough rank, but 45k a month is an outright lie and if he said that he's just hoping you're too young to notice.

The actual pay you'd be getting as an enlisted private straight out of high school is around $1733 a month, which is roughly $20k a year. For perspective, you'd make $15k a year working full time at minimum wage, so they wouldn't be paying you much at all. Heck, I'm a grad student and I get a stipend of $33k a year, and we're a demographic \*famous\* for not having much money.

And my brother made $60k in his first job out of college a few years ago.
considering indeed says the average for a company (10x the size of a section) commander is like 80k a year, i very much doubt it...
Yeah... no he doesn't. Recruiting is it's own billet. And most that I have know we're POGs not infantry. (I only know marine recruiters). My recruiter was honest and a good guy and some are, but the structure of Recruiting incentives and career impact depend heavily on how many people they enlist. In a place like where I'm from they don't have to really go our and recruit cause kids come to them, but in other places to meet their qouta they will lie and manipulate kids to get them to enlist. I wouldn't take anything he says too hard or to heart, because it's nothing he doesn't say to every kid to try and manipulate them into joining. His career probably depends on it. 

Also side note keep an eye out because inappropriate relationships with minors is not uncommon. If you see him too close to a kid or alone with one stick around just in case. It is a highly toxic job and you are fine and will be fine in your life. He's probably the one that hates his life honestly.
likely he’s an infantry soldier who came home after training and has stuck around for two more weeks to do some recruiting; they incentivize that. 

it benefits their cause by having a local youth talk to people they would otherwise miss, it benefits the soldier because they get to stay home longer, it can obviously hurt recruitment because they have people untrained in recruiting do stuff like that. 

i’m sorry it was like that for you, i remember aggressive recruiters when i was a kid also.
No. They need to sign up so many people to not get in trouble, but no incentive to recruit more then their minimum numbers.
Yeah, my high school had a recruiter outside the cafeteria at least a couple times a week. We also had ROTC, and some of the kids in that program, class, whatever, were kinda fucked. Had one kid threaten to assault me because I didn't take my hat off during the pledge of allegiance, because nothing says ""freedom"" like escalating to violence over a fucking hat for 20 seconds... 

Honestly, our whole military bullshit is fucking absurd...
Yeah that’s accurate. Recruiters are encouraged to use whatever underhanded tricks they need to get volunteers. Their favorite trick is going to young people who aren’t sure where they’re going in life and leaning on that insecurity to make them feel like the military is their only option.
>Catch them while they're young, not sure on what to do next in life, sounds like easy targets for rectuiters to me.

Uh thats the point? Historically most recruits in history are very young.
The experience on the outside is much much different from the inside. If you’re still in jrotc and they’re making you wear the uniform of the non conforming gender it goes against current guidance. 

I’m going to give you a quote, and if you have others in that class please let me know. I can dig up the exact guidance for them. This is absolute bull shit and if it was happening active duty side they would burn the place to the ground over night. 

“Once a Soldier is stable in their self-identified gender, they can then request to change their gender marker in the Defense Enrollment Eligibility Reporting System, or DEERS. Once the change is complete, all policies and standards for that given gender will then apply, the policy reads.” 

That shit head of a jrotc instructor is living in the military of the past.
This is very true. I was in the marines. While I TRAINED for combat, I never once saw actual combat. Instead, I spent 5 years working on aircraft, visited or lived in 9 countries I otherwise never would have seen, and got some decent leadership experience. Now that I'm out, I have 18 semesters of college tuition covered by the government if I want to use it all, with 8 of those semesters including a housing allowance so I don't have to work while going to school. 

Joining the military greatly improved my chances at escaping poverty without any physical or emotional harm. Same thing applies to a lot of others. But the reverse is also true. I know a few vets who also never saw combat that still came back messed up or never came back at all. And that percentage is only greater for those who do see combat. 

Shit on the military all you want. But don't shit on the people who serve. Most of us who join do so because we want a chance at a better life, not because we want to fight.
And rest are enabling them
Former Navy and Trans, served with at least one other trans person I know of. Seemed like 20% of everyone in was LGBT in some way.
Been that way since the 50s.
Wow dude purpose and structure while I blow up brown kids with a drone! So based.

Seriously though maybe don't uncritically spout talking points.
The military should not be trying to be a comprehensive social program. We have no comprehensive social program because we want people to have to depend on the military. Literally any comprehensive social program would be better than the military, but if we had one, people wouldn't want to join the military, certainly not as cheaply as they do. The lessons (both most specific training and most general life lessons) taught by the military are not an effective skillset for navigating the adult civilian world, as evidenced by how poorly many soldiers handle their money, and if you're directionless before you enter, you're probably going to feel lost when you leave.

A private makes _dick_all. Like I said, a private makes less today than I made in grad school 10 years ago, as a STUDENT. And yeah, that does include housing, which is a substantial amount more, but that probably brings it only just in line with my cost of living and income. Unless you can get in at a higher grade level, it's not a great option, and if you can get in at a higher grade level, you have someone else out there who'd pay you more.

If you don't have a trade in mind, go find one.
Who cares. I hope the military’s ranks languish. 

Stop furthering us imperialism.
In a lot of developed countries they don't use their military to enforce a global hegemony on military power
Which countries  would this be?
Yes to both of these comments!! It sickens me! I click ""stop seeing this ad"" and report them for being inappropriate. Because they are. It makes me so mad. You two might like Badflower's ""Machine Gun"". It's a sad song, but it discusses this topic well.
I keep seeing ads about how they give you opportunities to travel and learn new skills and it’s all so much fun, don’t worry about all that pesky combat stuff!

Not a hint as to what they actually want you to do, they just make it all look like one big summer camp.
America did the same thing last year this year is just “video games”
It breaks people, not gonna lie.  I physically hurt everyday.  Spouse had demons she deals with for what she saw and did, really bad sometimes.  Our sons college is paid for and he has a good life, he's a rung or two up the ladder from where my spouse and I started.  Don't want him in the military, period.  But I'd do it again to end up here.  Probably same for your dad, granddad.
(sigh) nope, no one did.  Just that they're victims.
It's a familiar feeling.  Apologies to op, I'm leaving after this.  Hate the recruiter, don't use broken vets to make a point.
I’d argue it’s socially funded, but it isn’t owned by the workers that comprise it
Yeah it's not really that impressive. The mean household income as of 2019 was $66k for reference.
>I mean, in the US ""to help"" the army is mostly to assist imperialism for oil and stuff. Still a bad choice of career.

Ok what is your alternative to our geopolitical problems in defending Europe and East Asian countries like Taiwan? I'd like to hear it.
And thats your opinion. A lot of people join the military out of desperation. I am one of those people. It's not good to judge others when they feel their only hope is to become property of a government.

Report him for doing his job?
i hate that I remember it, but he wrote everything down as he was saying it for some reason, and he wrote 45k down just like that. He probably just misspoke or I missheard
He probably meant to say a year, but he said a month. Either way I don't think how much money you make is a way to win an arguement
i mean maybe through outside stuff and investments they make that much but certainly not from being a millitant
Just to shed some light on the numbers - military members appear to have pitifully low pay because their food and housing is free. When talking about pay, you need to factor in the allowances made for housing and food (if they are allowed to live outside the barracks) to get a good comparison, as people outside the military are expected to pay for their own food and housing. A rough estimate would be 1800 monthly pay (though almost no one actually comes out boot camp an e-1), 400 a month for food, and between 1500 and 2000 for housing, depending on where you are stationed (numbers are standard and can be looked up). So 3700 a month or 45k a year for an e-1, maybe more. 

Recruiter definitely doesn't make 45k a month, but the military actually pays very well.
If this was the case everyone in the military would be signing up to be a recruiter.
I seriously thought the ROTC kids threatening regular kids over small shit was just a joke, holy hell.
I had a similar experience as you, trained for war but never saw combat and most of my days in the military were spent bored out of my skull. I joined because I felt obligated as a child of immigrant parents to pay back this country for the opportunity to live in the U.S. I traveled to places that I would never have seen, and interacted with cultures that enriched my life.

 I served my enlistment and left the Army with a license in nursing and paid for my  college tuition with the GI bill. I now  have a masters in nursing and live a wonderful, comfortable life. This recruiter and most of them are liars, but mine encouraged me to pick a military occupational specialty that translated to civilian life. I had a horrible GPA coming out of high school because I didn't apply myself but scored high on the ASVAB and with my GT score above 110 he said I could pick any ""job"" I wanted. This is the reason I chose Army instead of Air Force or Marines or Navy. I had my mind  set on joining the military to serve this country and came out escaping poverty. I wouldn't have even known to choose a medical profession if it wasn't for my recruiter. 

I personally am forever indebted to my recruiter for his guidance.
No one is shitting on you. We're shitting on the predatory system that manufactures poverty and convinces young people with brains that aren't even fully formed that the only way out is serving the same institutions that keep them impoverished. I feel empathy for vets cause I know most of them are victims of a malicious system
Who are you to tell me what my family is like / would do differently? Seriously. You don't know them. My college isn't being paid for by the military that's for fucking sure.
Broken vets ARE the point! Because it's a system that lies to you to get you in, chews you up, spits you out, and leaves you for dead! And the broken vets out the far side ARE the point. Without looking at what the system does to people, there IS no point.

I'm not sure why you don't like seeing this, and I respect you don't want to see it, but telling people to ignore what the military does to its people is just not appropriate.
The recruiter is the starting point for the politician-run pipeline from desperate 18 year old to broken vet or casualty. Service does get you a rung up, but it isn’t right that for many it’s the only way.
To make a point that it's malicious predatory system with no benefactors besides rich US politicians and weapons manufacturers? I think that's a pretty salient point to make.
They likely meant socialized, not socialist. Easy to get confused, they're very similar words.
>The mean household income as of 2019 was $66k for reference.

Is this taking into consideration that the average recruit is a high school graduate with 0 experience or qualifications?
Spending more than Russia and China COMBINED seems a bit excessive. Also, I'd argue that most US interventions or funding have a damaging effect. The fact Ukraine is an exception (a partial one) doesn't mean it's good for the US to play world cop. Sorry, say it's playing world cop while being a world robber.
You're right, I don't judge people who choose it out of economical desperation. I disapprove of people who believe going in the military is a noble thing.

For harassing a minor and trying to invade their privacy/gain access to their personal number after they've clearly expressed that they aren't interested.
He experiences no consequences for lying to you, absolutely none, and if you join because he made you feel bad, he doesn't get in trouble for not meeting his quota.
I mean if you could make that much, it'd be a decent argument, not gonna lie. Still probably a bad idea, but perhaps less bad.
nope, they're kinda unhinged a lot of the time. sometimes it's funny, sometimes it might as well be a hate crime tbh... like one of my friends was in it, and he was telling me how one of the students had to go to the hospital because they ate like, ten packs of laxative gum for some fucking reason during a weekend training thing that i guess they do every month or so. 

had another kid i guess just didn't know how to properly stand ""at attention"" or whatever it's called, and he wound up passing out because his knees locked up, so he had a gnarly mess on his face for a while.

though i will say that it was kinda cool for them to have let us play cards in the rotc building during lunch, at least for a little bit. someone did something stupid, not entirely sure who or what that i can remember, but we had to go elsewhere after a while. 

i think really the main issue with it all was that a lot of kids were basically placed in rotc as punishment, because they had behavioral issues or were dealing with legitimate mental health problems that likely didn't get addressed. so all the boot camp drill sergeant crap probably just made everything slowly get worse. pretty disgusting imo...
They were talking about themselves, not you
You misunderstand me, love you anyway.  Have a great day.
Because their ego doesn't want to admit they were preyed upon. It's a pretty normal response.
Agreed. Medical care for all military and their families, food and housing are also provided (either barracks/access to the chow hall, or monthly allowances for housing and food added to your paycheck). Also will pay the college tuition if you want to take any classes while in the military, on top of any college benefits you get after you get out. So 'free' healthcare, food, housing, and education all on top of your paycheck, along with yearly paid days off. Doesn't sound like anywhere else in America to me.
[removed]
Yeah, it's not illegal, a jerk move, but not illegal. And at best a complaint might result in another death by PowerPoint of how not to irritate potential recruits.
Has nothing to do with socialism. The military has paid for the living of soldiers since the first professional militaries thousands of years ago. Being a soldier means you may be in certain situations where you may not be able to have time to provide for yourself and your family.

Because of puberty I'm starting to look a lot more feminine and teachers are beginning to slip up, especially since I don't bind, today my English teacher used the wrong pronouns and I was going to let it slide because I'm used to being misgendered but my entire class corrected her and it was the most affirming thing to ever happen, I'm so glad I managed to get a place at an lgbt safe school"	"I love that for you bro!
Fuck I'm so proud of this generation.

heck yeah brother, that’s awesome
Wow, it warms my heart and gimme hope about the future!
How the hell did you get the register name changed to your prefered? I literally asked the office to change it and they literally just said “Oh We CaN aDd A pReFeReD nAmE tO yOuR pOwErScHoOl AcC” [that might as well be hidden because it doesnt show up anywhere]
that's wonderful to hear
That is so awesome!! Keep that one in your heart and remember it next time you may be having a tough day.
THAT IS THE BEST, LET’S GO LIL BRO 😎 👊🔥🎉
""You guys have \[LGBTQIA+ Safe schools\]?
Oh man, the kids are all right.
That's so amazing. Happy for you!
This reminds me of the time my transmasc friend accidentally got misgendered by our PE teacher and almost the whole class said “he” at the same time
I love this stupid ass generation so goddamn much💖
Stories like these make me feel more seen ❤️ i trupy believe by the time im older we’ll have such an awesome and understanding culture. There will always be shit heads but I think more people are realizing what shittiness looks like, and choosing to leave it for peace, kindness, and individuality ❤️
I'm so happy for you, I wish my class what half as accepting
Way better than my school wore a pronoun pin forgetting
 “This is the place of Christ.” 
The students were very very... very accepting.
I wish to go there
So happy for you! Trans people at my school mostly just get bullied so I’m glad to see there’s at least one place that isn’t hostile.
darn westerners and their 'tOlErANt aND aCcEpTiNG scHOOls'
Awesome!  
That must've brought happiness to you!  
Can i also come to that school with you?
Thats fantastic of them!
This is so wholesome 🥺
Awesome :)
Good to see the next gen is much more accepting, warms my cold dead heart. Props to your peers home dawg.
I'm happy for you, man! That horrible puberty will soon be no more, or replaced by T if you want to medically transition. mine was still going on the verge of 19, when I started T
im so happy for you, great your class is accepting and supportive like that!!
Let's go brother!! So happy for you
This is amazing and very heart warming. I'm glad you have such amazing class mates. I know for sure if I came out in high school it wouldn't have been so good. Do not take it for granted.
Not in america I presume?

So happy for you bro.
Omg zoomers can be elder now. Just let me buy my elder millennial coffin and call it a day.
Zoomers can’t be elders! Sit back down youngling.
I’m proud of you little shits

-young millennial
My parents went to my head of year, my school is lgbt safe so they're more understanding about it, it might be different in different areas of the world
That's really sad. I went by my middle name my entire life before I chose a new one cause my first name was also my dad's. They would read my first name on the register, I'd correct them saying I went by my middle name, they'd make a note of it and it was never a problem for the rest of the year.
Yes - a few of the teachers are lgbt themselves actually
Although my school is within a minority of safe spaces
I'm confused
Um, do you know how much coffins cost, millennial? Better start saving now.
some of them are adults who were born after 9/11
I had this exact same thought. I’m not even 40 and I’m turning to dust as I type this.
The oldest generation z right now is 24. They getting pretty close to being labeled elders. 

Now to make you feel old, I'm a legal adult... I was born in 2003, suffer
Yeah I'm joking. At 24 I'm a baby. Elder relative to the other zoomers I guess. Old enough that their slang scares me.
Which country?
stay confused.  


ok but for real, what is there to be confused about?
Just throw me in the trash
I hope you don't mean saving money cuz all I can afford to save is grocery bags
Just hire someone to build a simple pine box for you. Pine box and cremation for me, thank you.
Build one yourself, that’s what I’m gonna do
Reminds me of reading this XKCD when it came out. https://xkcd.com/647/
Cries in 1997 being the eldest Z here 😭😭😭😅
Shakes geriatric fist… “I GRADUATED IN 2003!”
I’m 21 and I feel old.
i'm 30 days off of being the literal eldest zoomer possible... i turn 25 in january next year.
I was born in 2004 and I'm going to be 18 in a few months

You're saying that it's bad for westerners to have safe spaces where they can be themselves
Well atleast it seems like that, anything in text like 'tHiS' always seems condescending / sarcastic
No, that's bad for the environment, just compost yourself
Plenty of space here
After you cremate me, pack me into here this bag.
I would probably have to start that while I was still alive tho, right?
97 here too... wonder which one of us is the true elder
I'm 17 and feel old. No real reason, just do
Oof you've got me beat by a few months. Off to the old folks home with you, shoo.
Wait, that's illegal only people born before 2000 can be adults!
No. Absolutely not. I will not allow this.
Im in America, we don't have much LGBT support where I'm at currently. I hate being bullied by idiots who think that the bible is the rule of the land.
im sarcastically condescending westerners and their schools, im just jealous

That would be most effective, yes
Can you beat August?
94... That mean I'm millennial right? I don't keep track of this crap XD
sometimes i feel that old

i don’t feel safe in lgbtq+ spaces that much	"now don’t get me wrong, 99% of the trans community is amazing, i haven’t felt more accepted by literally anybody else. however, some cis people in my school have been really bothering me and i wanted to vent about it a little bit bc i feel like you guys will actually understand me.

so i (18, FtM) am currently a senior in high school. this girl in my class (whom i will call “ashley”) has repeatedly deadnamed and misgendered me, and i think she has been doing this on purpose.

firstly, when i sat next to her (bc that’s the closest desk to my other friends) she told me “why does everyone call you ___(my preferred name)?”, to which i replied with “i’m trans, i just go by that name.” since she lacks what i can only assume common sense, she asks me, “can i call you __(my deadname) though?”

i have no idea what was going through her mind to reach a conclusion in which she managed to assume i’d be okay with that. like, think of it this way: let’s say there’s a cis person and they have a first name and a middle name. they tell you that they don’t want you to use their middle name bc they don’t like it, understandably so; you would stop calling them by that name, without asking a second question.

this is not a one time occurrence either, she constantly brings up my deadname as a joke.  i’ve been very strict about not liking my deadname and i have warned her multiple times. she doesn’t give a flying fuck the girl’s a solid bitch i’m sorry.

surprise fact though, she’s bisexual. this came up when me, a couple of friends (including her and her bf at the time) decided to meet up.

her bf asks, “so y’all are bi, yeah?” 

and my other friend replied with, “no, i think he [talking about me] is gay.”

ashley interrupts by saying, “no that makes __(my name) a straight girl.”

everyone else at the table kinda just stared at her, including her cis bf.

i then lied and said, “haha no i’m bi.” or smth like that.

bc of her, i keep on lying to people about my sexuality simply bc i’m terrified that other people are possibly thinking the same about me, she just makes me feel unsafe.

lastly, she keeps calling me “sis” and some other gendered shit like that, despite the fact that i told her that i was very uncomfortable about that. 

i no longer talk to her but i think that was my worst experience as a trans guy thus far. i don’t get sad, though at many points this year, i had to restrain myself to not beat her up. thank god i no longer go to school since they don’t take attendance anymore.

this is not limited to her either, many cis queer women ask me invading questions all the time. and they get offended when i don’t want to talk to them about my fucking pussy. like dude, just bc we’re both queer doesn’t mean you’re my best friend. (or just bc we share the same “organs”)

thanks for reading (sorry this has been a long one.)"	"If she uses the wrong name for you feel free to make up a name for her.
Sounds like a lot of TERF activity happening around you, I'm really sorry you're dealing with that.
Controversial opinion here, but I feel like a people especially immature teens feel that since they are LGBTQ+ that they can do no wrong and that the world to some degree revolves around them.
You're a bigger man then me OP. I would've been a complete asshole to them
This reminded me of one situation when cis girl in my class (idk if queer or not but probably not) called me ""Dominika or whatever you call yourself"" in front of a whole class and supportive teacher. Dominika is female version of my chosen name wich have nothing to do with my deadname so it was so much worse because it showed me that she did that on purpose. Life throw at us really weird situations and my only real advice is: correct her every time she does that. Usually unsupportive people become really mad when you correct them twenty or more times in one conversation and either cut out your 'friendship' (wich is good because it means your friendship is less valuable for them than your comfort) or correct themselves due to you just not reacting. Only problem is that you loose your progress every time you forget about it because they see it as their win. Win them with patience! If playing on their nerves doesn't work I suggest an arson.
sounds like she's a terf and shouldn't be allowed in lgbtq spaces until she learns to be polite to others. haters can't sit with us. I'd give her the freeze treatment and just ignore her. 

when I worked as a barista in a small town, passing as a guy but everyone knew everything about everyone so everyone knew I was trans. 

there was this cis girl who kept trying to say various women's names at me when we were on shift together. to see if I had any kind of reaction to them. she was trying to GUESS my deadname. one time I looked over at her when she said one, and she was like ""yeah! your name must be Emily , I totally called it!"" and I just ignored her from then on.  (I didn't stay at that job very long lol)

my deadname isn't Emily though. so I guess I won. 

anyway if this girl doesn't stop I hope her bf breaks up with her, because she's being really nasty and cruel. 

also I promise not all LGBTQ spaces are like this. most people are trans-friendly, there are still assholes like this around but they are going the way of the dinosaur. keep your chin up. 

I hope your friends do more to stand up for you.  maybe you should talk to them about how it hurts. good luck man.
Cis gays can be extremely transphobic, my understanding is they see our identity as a threat to their own. I just try to shrug it off, but I can understand why it would bother you.

The LGBT community really does need to come together more and help one another instead of in fighting all the time.
I think you should just call her Karen because she's making up a name for you, so give her a taste of her own medicine
""That makes (him) a straight girl""

""I don't know if she's deadnaming me on purpose.""

That sounds like .... a really horrific girl but also peak high school bullshit. I'm sorry you're going through that.
Yeah, the thing about the LGBTQ+ community is that (in my opinion) is very toxic.

I don't why or how but they always keep attacking the trans people. Like I heard close lgbt friends saying things like: ""Oh but trans women can't be lesbians because in that case they will be heterosexual""

Or:""Oh but being bisexual is being transphobic because you don't like trans people""

Also, just to clarify. I know most of the community is very chill but in my experience being trans and bi, they are very toxic in some points.

But anyway be safe bro, peace.
What a piece of absolute human dog shit, and I'm sorry to any dookies dogs have dropped that are better than her.
I know how you feel, my school is actually pretty progressive, people are open about their sexualities and people are almost totally chill about it, and theres even a few trans people at my school. But in spite of that, transphobia is pretty common. Only a few of my friends really understand my being trans, and despite being open about it (this was a few years ago, back when i thought i was a trans man and went by he/him pronouns, im agender now) id be referred to as a lesbian for dating my afab partner and be reffered to as she. Thats just my friends, outside of my friend group ive been reffered to as it behind my back, people asking about whats in my pants, and the typical transphobic nonsense. Ive never been aggressively misgendered when talking to someone, but almost everyone i knew - besides of a few people - would call me a lesbian and use she/her pronouns for me.

 Sadly, being transgender is a lot less accepted in general, even by people in the lgbtq+ community. And it really sucks, especially since people in the same community are hardly better than those outside of it. But for being a trans person, the community youll find to be the most accepting and safe is other noncis people, which even then can be unaccepting if youre outside of the gender binary. It fucking sucks, and all we can hope is that it gets better in the future and do our best to work towards a more accepting future.
Ugh, hate it when there’s a classmate like this, had a terf keep misgendering all three trans students one summer in college and would do it in and out of class.

Two of them got severe dysphoria after having to share a car with her on a class trip since she’s also the argumentative to the extreme type (she would argue with the professor almost every class to the point the professor had to not answer her questions.)

I finally had to ghost/ignore her since she wouldn’t leave me alone even though the professor spoke to her multiple times and she continued to misgender me  on campus after the class had concluded.

So my advice would be to not engage or converse with her since she’s likely not gonna stop otherwise. 

If she deadnames you, ignore her since she’s clearly not addressing you and is addressing someone else ;)
Your generous not to freak out and flip out on her.
I’m glad you don’t go to that school anymore
That fake friend can go fuck herself
Oh my god she sounds like a nightmare.  I hope you can avoid her from here on out because this is ridiculous, she definitely knows what she’s doing and is doing it specifically to hurt you.  Being bisexual or any other queer identity does not excuse you to be transphobic.  Also it’s sexual harassment for someone you didn’t invite to talk about your biology to be bringing it up in casual conversation.  I think you said you’re a gay trans guy?  Good for you man, that in no way makes you what she called you, in fact you’re next level gay.
Unfortunately there is a huge percentage of queer cis women who are super terfy.
Time for some new friends. Does your school have a GSA?
I keep seeming to get into arguments with lesbians a lot about terf things. Quite a few of them still disagree with people being nonbinary too. They're one of the most gatekeeping groups I've had the displeasure of associating with at some point. From what I've heard cis gay men also have similar issues. I just kind of stay wary of majority cis groups, in general.
Unfortunately there are several people in the community that are terrible thankfully the are more good folks than bad folks. I have so many stories of people I could share.
As you are 18 and a senior, graduation is only a few months away.  You can leave all the ""problems"" behind.  Just a short wait.
im so sorry . i feel this . i got to a christian school rn and god its just so shitty . theres literally a guy in my class that said he will deadname if i ever ""do anything"" . specifically by saying ' stfu [deadname] ' hes even called me the f slur . im real tired of dumbasses just lacking basic respect . not even my principal will have the brain capacity to correctly gender me all the time and he even deadnames me still . schools and the people at them can be so stupid when it comes to trans people . glad you dont really have to deal with her anymore . if she does something off school campus at least push her or something while telling her to stick her transphobia up her ass so she hopefully stops
Yeah cis queer people can be so rude sometimes . I know I had a cis gay dude here on reddit stalk my old account to call me homophobic and telling me to off myself for calling myself gay while being a trans guy. Feels like you have to have the patience of a Saint to be a trans person and not fucking back hand people sometimes.
Honestly. I agree I feel so welcome in the trans community but like other lgbtq communities are kinda shoving it in my face or even ours I’m not gonna sit here putting words into anyones mouth this is purely my experience and it’s frustrating like yeah be open but don’t make it your personality i feel like that should be with everyone like I don’t feel safe telling other communities how I feel because I’m scared they’ll tell others when I’m not open open about it
How in the fuck does you being a gay trans guy = straight cis girl??? That’s what I don’t get
same
So sorry you have had to deal with that.  Glad you get to take some distance.  

She’s certainly doing it on purpose for whatever misguided reason.  I can see a few options for reasonably dealing with her nonsense.

A) ignore her, cut her out, turn away, walk away every time she says anything transphobic.

B) over correct her - any time she does it say “oh, no, no, no, here, repeat after me - “he” …”he” …”he”.   You’ll get it, don’t worry”. as if the reason she’s misgendering you is because she’s a little slow.

C) flatly correct her every single time without even looking at her and without giving it any energy 

D) get all your supportive friends to pile on and correct her each time she does it.  Five people shouting “him” each time she misgenders you should shame her into stopping.


And with the invasive questions from cis queer women - you can quickly educate them while setting a boundary “you probably don’t know this, but it’s considered offensive to ask a trans person about their genitals unless they bring the topic up.  I don’t answer questions like that.  I know it can feel uncomfortable to not know, but let’s fight the patriarchal, hetero-centric bullshit together by getting comfortable with the uncertainty.  Are you with me?”  Or something like that.  Builds connection while confidently laying down the law.

Best of luck, and you may want to plan ahead for how you’ll handle Ashley’s nonsense at prom, because she’ll probably ramp it up when she sees you in a tux.
> a cis straight man, feel some shame

Please don't assume cis straight men are any less capable of understanding such issues.
She's clearly transphobic, I'm sorry you have to deal with that. Is there any way to distance yourself from her or talk about it with your friends? I know that's easier said than done but stuff like this can take a really big toll on you if you're around it for too long. ❤️
Everyone else said some great stuff so I won't go there, but this...

> thank god i no longer go to school since they don’t take attendance anymore.

Wait, what?

You don't go to school because you're done with school? Or you don't because you decided to stop because they no longer check if you're there? Soooo you no longer know what the tests are on, don't do homework, aren't there for tests... etc... And are going to fail...

Dude tell me it's not that you're just skipping class now
Ohh i have this problem too, well I'm mtf and bc there's this 1 guy on my bus who keeps constant misgendering and deadnaming me and he knows and I come off the bus really upset, (he's in Yr 11 I'm in Yr 9) but he went to my primary so that's where he knows my deadname from so yeah it's rubbish but we gotta stick together and the reason I'm telling ppl like this is bc the last time I posted on the mtf reddit I got targeted bc they said oh yeah 'he's just a GUY and you'llnever be a girl and u need to learn to love your gender(and they made this rly obvious)' as u can tell I get rly pissed and then I do this where I angrily type even tho it may not come across that I'm angry but I actually am angry yk my brain is very weird now I look at it... sorry but also thanks for reading my short story.
Maybe she just fancies you and it's a way to get your attention?

I'm sorry for that happened op. I think that it's really courageous to be out (I'm not)
I suggest arson UwU
Ugh. She likes u or is attracted to you.  Guarantee it. She can get violenced tho. What a bish.
[removed]
Sorry to hear that man. Hope you get better experiences in LGBTQ+ spaces in the future.


Take it easy bro✌
This is why I turned away from traditional neo-liberal LGBT circles and toward communist and leftist circles, what's more unifing that class unity? And to be a transphobic communist is to violate your own principles, this is why I support more that just anti-capitalist LGBT movements, but expressly communist and socialist movements
Hate to be hard but: you're a man. Act like it.

https://youtu.be/F6wla6eOMWs

2:00 is where it's at.
There was a girl exactly like that that went to my school, she would lie about being nonbinary (she came out as cis a little later on, right before she started being transphobic to people), then befriend transmascs just to misgender them. She even started harassing my friend about their genitals and their birth certificate as a “joke” until they cried. Cis queers/“allies” can be awful
This isn't really about gay people or straight people or cis people or  trans people. This is about fuckin bitches. You can't control that, man. She's just being a ratty kid and you're gonna encounter more of those as time goes on but you can minimize your time and space with them, for sure.

I hope you get a really good friend group that has your back so you don't have to pay attention to crap like this. You hang in there okay? It gets better.
Sending you my support, she really is a bitch.

I have discovered too non trans lgb places are not the safest too, including cis lgb women who think they are safe by default (wich happens to really really not be the case). It’s sad but yeah :(
Tbh I allow ppl to deadname and misgender me all the time it’s their liberty to be an ass, but from my point of view and personal experience it’s a real waste of time trying to care about what other people think of you. I learned this after hurting for so long, we can’t force people to like us. Let them assume and misjudge you, in reality they don’t know you. Don’t even feel bothered by it, thing that hurts them the most is seeing you not caring at all. Trust me, 2 years MtF in an Islamic country and still holding strong here, I’ve never been able to flaunt it tho everything I do is low key to avoid the court ofc. Had to DIY my HRT and everything, misgendering and deadnaming is the least of my worries.
Look dude the world is basically divided in 3 thrd , the first one is empathetic, they will understand even if start rough, the second third walks the world blindly unless a problem trigger their empathy cause touch them or someone they know, the las third don’t care about anyone, so potentially 2 third of the world that surrounds you can be your allies, if you have patience to make the second third to understand you. One third is lost on they’re believes and give them for lost.  Now being trans is one of the more complete and complex of human experiences, carry suffering on the way. You have to strong yourself and learn to give a fuck, there is a strange power in not caring. Please stop lying around to feel safe , you have more people that support you of the ones you believe. Second your sexuality do not need to match your identity, look i am a trans lesbian, as you already know I am basically a women attracted to women. I don’t want the masculine energy around me in romantic domains, the only men i want around are trans men, cause are the best men, the pinnacle of a healthy masculinity in most cases. ( or the guys of BTS they also are the very best man), when comes to gay men around is a situation of respect but i do not feel like i have many around, like half of them have a weird combination of toxic masculinity and bitchiness, the other half are very nice… but sometimes i feel something off. Like they get angry cause I am not a gay man… i didn’t choose to be this beautiful androgynous looking being ( just joking). But I understand, there are toxicity inside the lgbtq to, so instead of looking the whole community as unsafe, search for the positive beings inside it. My lesbian friends defended me like lioness every time someone try something weird around me, I do the same for them, when they go on a break up or super drunk i just stay by they’re side and protect them. Is mutual. You are starting is gonna be rough, but one day you will have a well established circle of protection. Now cheer up dude!! Chin up! You gonna do great much love from Switzerland!!

Btw i have a funny theory, I thing that bullying girl Is attracted to you, but as a female. And is pushing you to become what she likes ( very toxic).
I'm so sorry this shit is happening bro
If you think about it though, not only is she wrong but she forgets how manly you actually are, like dude, you transitioned into being a man, and you date other men, that's the manliest manly man to ever man, 200% man, keep going, soon enough you'll be a grown man with a beard and all, voice too, and you'll be able to look another guy in the eyes and say ""back when I was a girl scout..."" and cause fear within them >:)
Depending where you live you could get her in some serious trouble. Like in California purposely deadnaming and misgendering someone is technically sexual harassment and you can bring it up to a teacher.
I mean I feel this. When I went to TDOV a lot of people even some trans people thought I was a cis lesbian and it really broke my heart.
slap her
I feel as everyone should know just because you are LGBTQ doesn’t give u a free pass to hate on transgender people. We are all one community.
This fear has honestly kept me from real life queer places, like I just don't want to deal with it.
Hello many other trans ppl
Um just asking is there a trans and nb flag flair
Invite the bois over, the good ol’ FtM crew, and we’ll just bother the shit out of her. Piss her off till she leaves you alone at least.

Her: “I’m a TERF”
Bois: “Well hey now, we’re all lads here, no need to partake in a cool social circle you don’t deserve brother 😎”
Her: “I’m not a bro-“
Bois: “Hold on broski, macho boys like us gotta keep it real amiright? So why don’t you take your little stinky dude-o-rino attitude and scoot your boot on out of here bruv 😎”
Cis queer people are the worst sometimes :( they always think they have the privilege to misgender you just because they’re not straight
fun fact: she broke up with her bf so for some emotional damage, i could just call her by her ex’s name lols
It doesn't hurt as much
Happy cake day!
Happy cake day!
thank you, honestly you guys are amazing, i feel much easier knowing that there’s a supportive community like y’all
my sister is like that. i told her not to make homophobic jokes and to respect my pronouns but she said that its ok because she is gay :(
truee, the times i have heard the f-slur getting thrown around has been mind-blowing. it’s late 2000s yet again
Oh definitely. Have a cousin who's bisexual who also complained how ridiculous it is that the f-slur and r-slur are considered slurs...after explaining why the r-slur is bad and how it affects me as an autistic person.... I don't hold it too much against her since she was 13 but yikes
I've seen a TON of immature lgbt teens online. There's a lot of kids who seem to want to flex being oppressed while simultaneously being a bully. Seen a lot of them be transphobic as well and claim that they can't be because they're gay or lesbian or something 🤦🏼‍♂️ it's just kids trying to be edgy and bully people like many of them do. Just using different reasons to ""justify"" it.
tysm! honestly true, whenever someone (including me) correct her, i see some nerves twitching on her face. kinda funny ngl
holy shit man, sorry that happened to you :( thankfully i don’t have to go to school for the next two months due to us preparing for this big college application exam so i don’t have to see her until prom. 

and you’re absolutely right, people are learning much more these days and i believe that one day we can all live our lives much more peacefully; THESE people will be made into the butt of the joke, not us.
Okay ***what the actual fuck***
true, there is a reason why it’s called “the lgbtq+ community” we are community that needs to stand together, not a football team where each letter fights against each other until the last standing letter gets a medal or smth
Did you read my mind? Literally came down here to basically post word for word this xD
Arson time?
She fell into my fist
prom is going to be very interesting this year!!
STOP RIGHT THERE CRIMINAL SCUM
I hate the implication that bisexuality doesn't already include trans people. When people say ""I'm pan I like cis and trans people"" it makes me feel so othered and disgusting like they had to make a whole new category just to include me? It's like they're just finding a way to appear inclusive but also solidify that I don't count as a man, I'm some other thing. Like I never thought of myself as trans anything that label is assigned and forced onto me by the world that won't just accept that I'm a man. Most people I've met that describe pan that way (I know that's not what pan means to a lot of people and those ppl are okay) fetishize tf out of trans bodies.
one of the reason i think of myself not having any relationship in the future, the catchphrase "" i'm used to it "" ? that's me. lmao. it sucks but at some point you get pissed. find people who are not asses; you need people.

fun facts:

there is cishet guy at my school that advocated for my name and pronouns without me EVER telling him about it. i'll do anything for that guy to be happy. it was reported to me by a random person. i never met. i love it. in this school, cishet people are more accepting than lgbtq+ to me they don't even invite me to anything lmao.
yeah they have an administration thingy but i live in a more conservative country so i can do nothing really. even then, i want to handle the situation on my own without some authority involved (plus: i have some better friends now days!! people that are not in her friend circle know she’s an ass so—)
same here: for example, i don’t want to make a huge deal out of being trans, that’s just who i am y’know? so rather than “bragging” about or making my entire personality about  something i didn’t choose is not something that sits right w/me
yeah you’re actually right, it’s just generally a thing for some reason that men are less accepting of these things and all. still, guess i shouldn’t’ve used that
okay so i feel like i need to clarify this, i’m not american. and i have this huge exam coming up by the end of the year, it’s more important than any school exam you can take. my school is thankfully helpful and they “assist” us through exams, (let’s not question the legality of it)

so to let us study more for the big exam, they let us go home so we can study in libraries, at home, etc.
god forbid bro,
I'm sorry that's been your experience. I'm a gay dude so not dating bi women, but like, this has not been an apt description of any of the bi women I've ever met. (Not to mention, trans women can also be bi, kind of feel like you ought to have specified cis, as well?)
my gf said go harder and date her ex.

(i highly dont suggest it but that would i guess be a pretty big power move if it wasnt like... unearthly pettiness. especially if he was bi and liked dudes like basically pissing on her grave.

Still dont suggest it but I thought id share the joke to you)
That sounds great
Mix it up with some bro, dude, guy, or buddy
That might be annoying to her ex though, and he seems chill. I'd give her a masculine version of her name (no matter how stupid it sounds)
Like say her name is Jessica, call her Jerry. If her name is Ally, call her Al. Make sure to also use he/him pronouns for her. Calling her ""hey bro"" ""my dude, what's up?"" ""Pretty sure he's gay btw"" etc. Make sure she gets the fucking point.

I usually don't condone misgendering, but transphobes deserve it.
Good idea!
*stretch* go on.
Alternatively let's not let this subreddit turn into /r/teenagers. Don't fight childish highschool tactics with childish highschool tactics. Don't even entertain the hypothetical as a means of therapy. Anyone over the age of 20 will tell you: you won't ""win"", and it won't make you feel better.
or ""[ex's name]'s girlfriend""
You have to fuck her ex.
True but it’s about making a point
Thanks
Thank you
I learned this but well last night and i have to pay it forward dude. So much love from strangers deserves to be something felt by everyone <3
So‽

That's like saying you get an n-word pass cause you're Asian. :/
I think it’s fine for gay people to reclaim gay slurs. It wouldn’t be okay for a cis queer person to use the t slur though because it doesn’t apply to them.
You should do like that one tweet where a dude blew an air horn every time someone misgendered or deadnamed a trans person lmao
how's it goin doppelganger? lmao
indeed
Like how some dudes fall onto shampoo bottles, or cucumbers....or phones
Thank god someone gets it 😭😭
Yeah, same here, I feel like this too nc I just want to be who I am without making a massive fuss yk, I just want to be who I am without ppl questioning it. Hope u get thru this and if anyone needs help dm me and I'm happy to help 😊 I try to be as friendly as possible bc I'm mtf trans so ya ☺️
OHHH OKAY lol way different than the US. Good, I thought you were dealing with transphobia and were like, fuck school, I'm not going to finish high school, and I hoped to talk you out of it lol

Truancy is uh kind of an American thing too.
Ikr but that's what it sounds like she mad for crushing on u so she's mean to u
Idk ive met some fairly vile bi trans women too :/ only difference is that they sexualize me in a slightly less transphobic way :/
""This has not be an apt description of any of the bi women I've ever met""

This to me means that now youre claiming that just because you haven't met any bi women who are chasers (not to mention you're ftm so you wouldn't experience chasers the same way i would) means that NO bi women are chasers??
ooh! ooh! I know! If he's upset with her for breaking up or has negative feelings toward her, offer to help him get back while simultaneously getting back, yourself.

Just pretend to be really close to each other, and he can say stuff like ""Man I'm so glad I don't have her anymore, she's so toxic."" and ""men are better anyway"" or something around her to rub salt in her wounds.
I don't suggest it either

Date her dad instead
Date her ex, and film yourself railing him in front of a giant banner that says ""-------- is a bitch"" get the school to hold an assembly, and switch the videos last second to show the video you made in front of the entire school, then have a large group of friends throw used condoms at her while chanting something that would really piss her off (maybe mention a dead relative) then when she gets home, she walks into her living room to see $200 worth of confetti strewn about.
Happy cake day
you’re kinda right, though i’m taking the piss though dw i’m mindful enough to not get myself into trouble.
That misgendering people you don't like is ok?
I've know some cis bi women who say they are allowed to say the f slur because they've been called it in the past. Ive been called the d slur a ton but I'm a trans gay dude and I personally don't feel right saying that word at all. I don't really get it but people get super defensive about being allowed to say slurs so I just gave up on that fight 😭
I honestly am not okay with the t-slur at all.

no matter who it's coming from.

In fact, I was recently doing an art and I wanted to put the t-slur in it for reason relevant to the art..... I couldn't even bring myself to put it in partially censored.
dude that’s actually brilliant jdnsjcnd
Do you have a link to this?
Now I really want to find this video
When and where king, when and where, ill even bring marshmallows and Graham crackers for smores
Can I join?
Aw, man, that sucks, I'm sorry.
I'm not saying that, and it might not be my place to say. It just seemed like a really broad brush to be painting bi women with. Perhaps it was not my place to comment, and this seems like a sore issue for you, so I'm sorry for pushing.
YES THIS
pffft- hey satan? i just wanted you to know im a really big fan/jk
Thanks
Fuck what this persons saying. In this case, I’d have already punched her teeth in by now, what a c***. Fuck with her and pour that salt right into her transphobic wounds as much as you can.
Calling someone the wrong name isn’t misgendering. The point is it’s still annoying, and he should stick up for himself
I also don’t feel comfortable with it, but I’m not gonna take the option away from other trans people who have been affected.
I only think it’s good in like a radical political context, it otherwise feels just wrong
I'm sure she'd shut up REAL quick 😂🤭
at midnight when they least expect it, then we celebrate it with the leftover drinks we got from our enemies
everyone’s invited!
Him: ""I can't believe I ever actually *liked* her!"" audibly shudders ""Such a terrible woman. Just generally unpleasant.""

OP: ""Yeah and how she treated me was pretty awful""

Him: ""Exactly! She needs to learn how to behave around people. Seriously""
Happy Cake Day!
Ooh forbidden punch?
Bet count me in I’ll grab my blowtorch and katana
Thank you
Make sure you bring some snacks
Happy Cake Day!  Is it carrot cake?  If so, can I have some?
Oh yeah ill get the pickles and scones
Sorry rum cake
\*steals all your rum cake*

\*realizes it's not actually alcoholic*

My teacher just told me that he's gonna deadname me from now on.	"He's been calling me by my name this whole semester, now out of nowhere he told me that as long as my chosen name isn't in my passport, hell deadname me.

I feel horrible. I'm embarrassed to be called by my deadname and it's humiliating to have to argue with teachers over this simple thing. I'm ready to give up at this point

Edit: Thank you so much for all the nice comments.
Many have adviced me to talk to admins or the principle but that really wouldn't help me. They're basically on his side.
Others have said to ignore him or misgender him in return and while I appreciate the advice- I honestly don't have the guts to do that. The people in my class already don't like me because I've done similar things and I'm too scared of men/authority to talk back. I feel really weak.

Btw, I'm in Germany, not in the states."	"this is blatant transphobia, can you go to admin? if they don't do anything and it's safe go to local news, schools hate bad press.
I’m so sorry, that’s really messed up. Is there any way faculty could do something or switch you out of course? I can promise that once you get out of high school and into the real world things will change for the better too. Hang in there
Report his ass.
“Is there a Nicholas here”

“Yeah, but I go by Nick”

“I can’t call you that if it isn’t on your passport”

-conversation that has never happened in all of human history
Idk how he is and how much you  are willing to maybe get in trouble. But when my teacher started to missgender me, I missgendered him back. He got very angry, I told him that this is how I feel too and as long as he don't accept my Pronouns, I'll not use his preferred Pronouns too.
I had to talk with the principal, told him what's going on and he was super understandable, had a talk with the teacher and after that, the teacher never missgendered me again (but was a bit passive aggressive for the rest of the year).

Maybe just call him by his first name. If he don't respect the name you wanna be called, why should you talk to him respectfully with his name of choice? I mean, his first name is in his id so with his logic, it's totally acceptable to call him by this.
Don't respond. Refuse to put the deadname on tests and assignments. If the ""teacher"" does roll call and deadnames you there, say nothing. That person isn't in the room.

When you ask for a hall pass, if the deadname is on it, record it. Refuse any questions addressed incorrectly.

Am assuming high school :)

You WANT to get called to the Principal for ""disobedience"". You want the deliberate deadnaming on file against this so called teacher's record of your ""misbehaving"" has the deadnaming as trigger.

Then. Make an official complaint beyond the school. Bide your time, let the evidence mount.
""alright but I'll be referring to you as Mr. Sphincter for the remainder of the year""
Hi I am sorry for you. In Germany this would be illegal. You dont have to accept this. Try to get help from your parents from other teachers or from your class. You have elected a class representive put them to use that is their job.
And dont let you get draged down by this your teacher will learn to respect you the easy or the hard way.
>as long as my chosen name isn't in my passport, hell deadname me.  


That's really weird, after all, in most English speaking countries, a lot of people get addressed with something which isn't what's on their passport, like Bob instead of Robert or Beth instead of Elizabeth. But I guess common courtesy doesn't extend to trans people.
Your school district should have some kind of paper to set a nickname for you there, and if that doesn’t work make a complaint.
Refer to him only as his full legal name, first and last. It’s the name on his passport after all, he can’t just change it to Mr Lastname
Ugh fucking typical cis behavior hiding his transphobia behind legal documents. I wonder if he has this policy for cis students who use nicknames. What kind of pissbaby cards someone for basic human respect.
If your school has a psychologist or a school therapist of some kind maybe talk to them, and ask them to talk to the teacher who is bothering you about why it’s important to use the correct name for their students, this worked for me at least
What country are you in? This is illegal in many places
Depending on your state laws if you’re in the US your teachers LEGALLY have to use your preferred name.
I wouldn’t even get mad. I’d start calling him Mrs. Name until he gets pissed off.
I remember this being possibly a law to pass in my state, if the parents aren't notified you have to use your dead name and it sucks
What?! Some people don’t even have passports.

What possible reason could he think to give that any self respecting school would tolerate? Is this in a heavily transphobic country where authorities would pressure him to use deadnames?
Trans teacher here, fuck that guy. I have several students in my classes going through various identity journeys and I am the one many of them come to if it is for their gender identity and/or sexuality. Bullying and deadnaming by the other kids is already horrible enough but to also have a teacher ACTIVELY ENCOURAGE IT? Over the name not being in a passport? What if he’s talking to a recently married adult who took their partners last name and hasn’t gotten a new passport yet? Bet he doesn’t use their old last name when addressing them…
Depending on your state you have actual rights as a students and you should use them to get this asshat teacher reprimanded, and or fired.
Everytime they do it, you have to stand up for yourself and call it out, and ask why they are deliberately trying to upset you.

It will disrupt the class and they'll have to give up in the end. A foolish bully like that won't be able to handle the shame of being constantly called out.
Don’t answer when he uses your deadname. He doesn’t respect you, you don’t respect him back. Two way street. When he gets mad, sends you to the office, confronts you, whatever. Tell him that isn’t your name and you won’t be responding to it. 

Call him the wrong name. If you’re supposed to use mr. Whatever then call him by his first name. 

Alternatively request going to another school. Or request changing your passport. 

But respectfully, there will always be people like them. Don’t give them an inch. What’s the worst that could happen, and is that worth your dignity?
The aspect of this that blows my mind is that prior to the entire trans awaking of our modern era, teachers in every school I've ever been in were more than happy to call kids any name they preferred.

Preferred your middle name? Sure, no problem.  Preferred a shortened nickname? Absolutely.  Preferred a nickname from the family that differentiated you from another family member? Ok.  Preferred a stupid nickname that a friend started calling you 2 years ago when they were drunk and it stuck? Not a problem.  Prefer to go by your last name? That's fine.

Seriously.  I've had teachers call fellow students the following: Saucepan, Lieutenant (was not in the military), Skills, Buzz, etc.  First day of class in school, many teachers would pass out a sheet in class so students could provide information on themselves to help the teachers get to know the students better, and preferred name to use in class was always at the top.  When I was a substitute teacher, the roll sheets had preferred nicknames on them so the substitutes would use the correct preferred name.

To be clear, I live in a deep red, GOP, right wing, conservative area of the US.

Once the trans movement became more open, suddenly everyone has to be called by their birthnames.  We can't call them by their chosen names anymore.  It's blatantly political and exclusionary.

'Hey teach, can you call me Saucepan from now on?' Sure thing, sounds like a good story, care to share?

'Hey teach, can you call me Susan instead of Rick, it would mean a lot to me?' No, nope, nadda, F off with your feelings, I'm gonna deadname you out of spite.

It's just such a weird change.
If it was me I would just refuse to respond to anything but my chosen name. I would say things like “ Who is that.” “Idk that person” “you have the wrong person” and generally ignoring and acting like you have no idea who they are talking about. Do not respond to anything but your preferred name.
pretend as if he's talking to someone else
You need to report this to a guidance counselor or someone in administration
Teacher here. Sometimes teachers even out students to their parents which is unacceptable, so be careful in case you're not out to your parents. The rest of the comments had some brilliant suggestions if you are out: be loud about it. Schools should not violate the student's human rights and they will have a hard time living down the label of bot being tolerant of others.
When you change your passport you should slam it on his desk.
Start referring to him by his first name and insist that you can’t call him Mr. because it isn’t on his passport. If he is not willing to give you respect you shouldn’t give him any either.
Call him barbara. Misgender thel back see how they like it
If you can talk to your parents and the school administrator (principal). Start with a safe teacher if you need to. I am so sorry this is happening. 

Have some trans dad hugs if you want them.
Report him at the school then go to the local news and tell them. Like someone said, schools hate bad press and will do anything to get you to shut up. Especially if what they did isn't politically okay.
This is... extremely strange. It won't solve the issue almost certainly, but I'd still ask the teacher \*what\* prompted that change. If it came out of nowhere seemingly, I can't help but ask what happened recently to change the teacher's attitude?  


Still both stupid \*and\* shitty of the teacher to do that to you.
Ignore him. Whenever he dead names you pretend to not realise that he's talking to you.
Maybe you should try getting a [dgti Ausweis](https://dgti.org/2021/09/05/der-ergaenzungsausweis-der-dgti-e-v/). You could also ask the nice people over on r/germantrans for advice.
Call him ""Mrs. X"" and see how he likes it.
I would not respond
That mother fucker said what. I'm so sorry. If you need any support, my DMs are open.
Give him a name that makes him feel shit too and report his transphobic arse!
God I am so angry for you. I'm now allowed to write my name on papers, I have to use my deadname on papers in school and such bc it hasn't been legally changed yet. So ik how you feel and I'm furious for you. Honestly if you are able to be petty, call the teacher out whenever he uses nicknames for students or ignore them when they refer to you as your deadname. But this is so awful, and Im very sorry you gotta go through this
WeirdChamp

I'm so sorry, I wish I could give you a hug
My god, how can people have so little empathy? I mean, seriously? Is it really THAT demanding to make a TINY LITTLE effort and at least try to not be a jerk? Can some people not just realize that they are causing HARM by doing that? It's like those people don't care at all about causing harm...

I can't really relate to that but I do understand that it must suck really bad... If I were you I would go see the head of your school/university though, because you never know I guess? Maybe there are LGBT associations close to where you live, that could help you make things move a bit. I do understand that it is hard and requires to take action and have some guts, as you said... But it might really be worth it, not only for you but for others as well. 

Another thing that you could do is maybe get a letter from your psychologist or something, mentioning that doing this causes you great harm or something like this... Like, to have an official statement from a medical professional. If you can find such a person who would be willing to help you I think the teacher could change his mind, as this person might have some more authority and be more respected. Hell, you could maybe even ask your psychologist to directly call the school too!

Again, I'm really sorry for you and I can imagine this is a really shitty situation for you... I wish you all the best and good luck!
Was ein Hurensohn
I’m so sorry this is happening, if the school won’t help you you could try going to the news I’m not sure how Germany feels about lgbtqia+ so do what’s safe for you if you ever need someone to vent to feel free to message me
Just don't react to your deadname..also do things like talking all the time,painting the walls, just somehow interrupting him on purpose in his class so he eventually has to call you by your name and just keep doing when he refers to you with deadname
If your school admins won't do anything write an E-mail to the ""Kreisverwaltung"" explaining everything. If they won't do anything I can't think of anything either
In Germany you are protected by the law against transphobia. Fill a complaint against him in the regional education board.
This is discrimination (specifically around gender identity) and they are not allowed to do that. You should really report it to someone, your other teachers, your principal? What he's doing is completely wrong, I'm so sorry...
Contact an admin asap he isn’t allowed to do that (depending on where you live it is even illegal but even if not it is still a shitty thing to do) sending hugs if you want them tho
Report him and transfer out of that class
isn't that illegal?!
My art teacher did something like that too last year, but she always called me by my last name which is a little better I guess. It’s still very disrespectful tho. If he is this stubborn about this, just try to do your best in the class so you can get out of it. Try to do your best to ignore it and you should be free when school ends. I know it’s not the best but it might be the only option. It’s what I had to do.
I'd put an end to **that** *SOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO* f'n fast......

I'd have a heart-to-heart talk with Admin.  You're now in a position where, if you have ever wanted to own your *own* school....  Even *much* better if he said this / embarrassed you in front of others....
Yeah, could understand it. Have the same at my work. They know the old name hurts me and do it, just because they want to show their disapproval.
I think depending on your situation, there's a few options (I am a trans high school teacher btw) based around a) how much you want to fight (and I can't blame you if you don't), b) parent support

&#x200B;

1) Refuse to answer to any name but YOUR NAME. Your name isn't the name that's on your passport, your name isn't the name on your birth certificate.

2) Continuously and repeatedly point out hypocrisy. If there any non-trans student who goes by a name different from on their passport, make a fuss. Is there a William who goes by ""Will"" or ""Billy""? Point it out.

3) Be clear and self-advocate. Any time a teacher deadnames you on purpose. Point out something along the following, ""You know that's not my name. Why are you purposefully discriminating against me?"" Or things of a similar note.

&#x200B;

I AM aware all of these require a willingness to fight, and you have enough on your plate without feeling you have to deal with extra. But do know some places aren't like that (here in WA state its a policy that teachers/districts call students by their name).
If you're in America, that's illegal. Speak to your school counselor, then the title IX coordinator, and threaten legal action. Don't be afraid to follow through.
I don’t know where you are so it’s hard to say what the laws are, that being said if you’re in the US that’s absolutely a title 9 violation.
Start calling them the wrong name.
Tell him that that's not your name and you refuse to answer to it. Technically he can call you whatever he wants, but on the flip side you only have to answer to whatever you choose. If he uses your deadname just look confused and don't acknowledge him.
I'd call him by the wrong Name and pronouns until He changes the behaviour....good Morning Mrs. Xyz.... german rules are bad but our typically german blind rule followers are even worse
Vieliecht, du könnest ihn immer dutzen? Es tut mir leid, dass er einen totale Arschloch ist.

Page 15ff. might be relevant to you. Good luck!
Hey, I don't have any advice but I wanted to say that you are valid and I am sorry that you have to deal with this.
Just don't respond if he uses your deadname, thats not your name so why would you respond?
Call him by the wrong name. Even better if its a name he doesn't like. When he gets upset tell him you'll stop when he does.

(This wasn't my idea, someone did this in another reddit post, I think on r/pettyrevenge).
So the unfortunate thing is if you are in a public school (and I am assuming in the USA) some states have weird laws on what teachers can call students, I don’t remember what states have them but if I am remembering correctly they are fairly common
Start calling him sussan, since names don't matter aperantly
Call him Mr. whatever from now on. Prof usually hate being called Mr. or Ms.
This teachers new name is, Johnny no dick. Maybe Gary goat fucker. Lean into the fuckery, time to make a scene.
Ahoi, person from berlin, germany, here. talk to lgbtq+ magazines, like siegessäule, l-mag or others. Go public with this, how trans-people are still treated in school, at the job etc.
""Good morning deadname""

""Good morning asshole""

\-me in OP's shoes
transphobia, yum! /j

seriously. please report this dude immediately. if someone is going to work within a school institution, they should be respecting their students and piers.
Are there any anti-discrimination laws that can apply in this situation where you live? You may be able to sue them or report them if there is since this is discriminatory towards you, or you could try and find a new school if possible.
Wow, what an awful person. I would go to an admin or the press. Unless the administration is actively enforcing this because people suck. Either way just know that people's ignorance does not make you any less valid. A rose by any other name would smell just as sweet. The problem is on their end, and they're being weird. It's like if someone just randomly started calling me Samantha instead of my actual name.
This is religion in action. I’m so sorry this is happening to you. No one should be called their deadname.
get the office involved. this is legitimately illegal.
Also ich würde dem Lehrer klar machen das er einen Schutzauftrag hat. Du bist sein Schutzbefohlener. Dich zu mobben, und was sollte Deadnaming sonst sein, kann einen Verstoß dagegen darstellen, außerdem ist es definitiv gegen die Verfassung. 

§1 Die Würde des Menschen ist unantastbar. Sie zu achten und zu schützen ist Verpflichtung aller staatlichen Gewalt.

Durch Mobbing wirst du in deiner Person herbgewürdigt. 

Sag ihm das du anfangen wirst sämtliche seiner Mobbingausfälle zu dokumentieren, ebenfalls Reaktionen der Klasse oder anderer Mitschüler. Dokumentiere ALLES! Allein das könnte schon helfen da es ihm Angst machen könnte das du kein wehrloses Opfer bist. 
Verlange von ihm das er es unterlässt dich mit deinem amtlichen Vornamen anzusprechen da dieser seelischen Stress in dir hervorruft und er dies als Schutzbeauftragter nicht darf. Du könntest anbieten das er dich stattdessen mit Nachnamen anspricht wenn er zu unfähig ist sich deinen neuen Namen zu merken, das geht auch ohne ein Herr oder Frau da du evtl nicht verlangen kannst ge-Sie-zt zu werden. Sage ihm du wirst wenn er das Mobbing nicht unterlässt weitere Schritte einleiten wie folgendes:
Du sprichst mit deinem Therapeuten darüber und lässt dir die seelische Belastung bestätigen. Wenn du keinen hast such dir einen brauchste eh. Sag ihm, dass wenn du wegen ihm ein Trauma (wie z.b. Angst vor der Schule oder dem Unterricht bei ihm bekommst und deine Noten darunter leiden) davon trägst du ihn und die Schule verklagen wirst. 
Such dir Hilfe bei einem Jugendbetreuer, auch wenn kirchlich finanziert betreiben Karitas oder Diakonie oft Jugendzentren in denen normalerweise aufgeschlossene Betreuer sind die dir helfen können. Ein Schreiben an die Schule mit einer Aufforderung zur Unterlassung von Mobbing durch Lehrer garniert mit ein paar Präzedenzfällen oder Gesetzesverweisen kann Wunder wirken.

Halt mich doch mal auf dem laufendem.
Wie stehen überhaupt deine Eltern dazu? Interessant wäre auch wie alt du bist da das maßgeblich deine (rechtlichen) Möglichkeiten bestimmt.

Außerdem ist r/germantrans der bessere Ort für dich solche rechtlich relevanten Fragen zu stellen. Du kannst nämlich ggfs dagegen vorgehen, es gibt Gesetze.
im so sorry. i wish i could say something to make you feel better. maybe try going even higher up. sue if your family is supportive and if youre mentally okay enough to fight. if youre not, thats okay. hang in there. if you need someone, to listen, to just talk, im always here. im thinking about you.
Support from the Czech Republic - I'm in the university And I seriously had to bit my tongue on my deadname. My headmaster refused to call me by my new name since I didnt have legally changed it at the time. The sad thing is that in this ""adult world"" your word has very little meaning. I don't know the policy in Germany about name change, but until then (if your headmaster doesnt support you) you can't do much.
Thankfully at university you don't have to talk much, so I didnt argue with those teachers who only checked that you attended their class but I personally talked to my english teacher (cuz u talk alot in lessons And I wasnt comfortable) and he was supportive like 120%.

But try your luck, maybe the authorities in your school will be more open minded.
Report him. He has no right to refer to you as anything other than what you want to be called.
Call him by his first name. Herr Andreas Müller, ich hätte da eine Frage! It's in his passport, he shouldn't bother.
Fucking nonsense, every teacher I've ever had would call us by a nickname if we asked nicely, this is no different.  Who gives a FUCK which mouth-sound you make to get a person's attention, just call a person whatever they ask you to...
What if u wouldn‘t react if he call you by your dn?i mean…
Did you ask him why?

what a piece of shit, tranphobes cling into anything to excuse their bullshit, report him if you can
Refer to them as opposite gender in front of the class. So instead of Mr call them Ms Asshole and vice versa. The little humiliation might make them rethink. And if they make a stink make it clear they started it and there's an easy fix.
Idk, I haven't experienced this since I haven't transitioned yet. I'm sorry that happened to you and hope it gets better ❤️
I'm not someone who's dramatic about these things but he's basically being a transphobic little bitch. He's intentionally insulting you so you should go to your principal with a description of the event and a few people supporting you writing about your credibility and that they agree with you. Remember, this shit shouldn't stand and you'll be helping trans  people after you. He's using the passport thing as a scapegoat to be transphobic tbh.
Stop answering until he gets pissed- If he sends you to the office because you ignored him talk to your counselor about sexual discrimination.

:) Technically he would be discriminating you...

Enjoy~

Edit: Transphobic asshole
Whatever dosnt kill you makes you stronger ..pain is a part of life and in going through school ..  if nothing changes due to you trying to do somthing about it, try excepting the way it makes you feel .. then when your in that moment analyze the situation, start thinking more into your goals and objectives. There is and will always be hate and discrimination towards you no matter who you are and what kind of person you choose to be. 
 What I have learned to do is ignore the hate ignore the people that have small minds and don't want to grow.. The path you have chosen is your own its you vs you. It's going to be hard but you got this I believe in you don't give up hope be strong and keep on pushing through all that hate
Assholes are assholes.  My daughters birth name is Kate.  We have always called her Katie.  She had a very significant speech delay which limits cognition.

She had a teacher that refused to call her Katie.  To my child at that level of her development, calling her Kate was similar to calling her John.  It wasn't her name.  It angered her quite a bit and the teacher was unrelenting.

The teacher has to be who he is for the rest of his life.  You have to deal with him for a year.  Use this person to teach yourself to be better, to learn tolerance.  Or, ya know, go to the Principle or the School Board and lay waste to the entire organization.

You aren't in the wrong.  Pure, undiluted righteous indignation is a beautiful thing.
Just don't respond to them whenever they dead name you. (This can either go two ways a good way or bad way) I wish you the best of luck in your transition.
Doesn’t respect you? Disrespect back. He is now She and if she doesn’t like it, tough titties.
Your teacher is an asshole. There's no excuse for this except bigotry. Tons of people don't go my the name on their passport for tons of reasons. It's just common courtesy to call someone what they've asked to be called.
Can you request to at least be called by your last name?
? Why do you care?. You cant force people to do what you want.
If it is coming from your local admin (Schulleitung), try to talk/write to an politician. I'd propose asking the office of Tessa Ganserer, an Bavarian Mitglied des Bundestages, about it.

Also, if you have strong support from family and/or friends, try to contact the local newspaper. From my experience, the local newspaper is one of the best ways in quickly changing the position of local german Administrations.
Is this sort of thing tolerated in Germany?     This is outrageous.      I am so sorry you have to deal with this.
The way I deal with people screwing up my name is I tell them to call me sock.
Deadname? That's new. Why not birth name? I'm a supporter of LGBTQ rights and a very good friend of mine is trans, but what's with all the new terminology? New LGBTQ words for the same old stuff. 

It seems counterintuitive for a group of people who struggle and fight to be accepted into mainstream society to separate  themselves by [so much semantics](https://lgbtq.smcgov.org/lgbtq-glossary) from everyone else. 

It's just my opinion so don't crucify me.
It really sucks that a TEACHER would do that. Pretty sure, at least according to my teacher dad, they're meant to do the OPPOSITE. Depending on the laws over where you live, if you're old enough you can legally change your name. And if YOU aren't old enough, where I live you can get your parents to change your name instead. Also I like the ideas of misgendering him that other people have suggested but if you're too nervous to then that makes sense. One of my classmates last year told me to misgender our maths teacher if she misgenders me and then snaps at anyone who corrects her. I for one like the idea of using her argument against her, like 'oh I'm sorry Mr Cr- oops I mean Mrs, sorry I just have so many teachers I almost forgot'
Depending on where you live, this might be illigal if you're able to do so , seek legal council
good luck
Find a local queer organisation or advocacy group and tell them what’s happening. It’s discrimination and even in Germany the school can get in a lot of trouble for it
Bavaria is one of the worst places to be trans in Germany, if what I’ve read on it is accurate. I’m sorry that he’s acting this way. If you need a teacher to properly address you with the respect you deserve, my wife is a teacher and I used to be in a field very close to teaching. We’ll even record something so you can hear it whenever you need to if you want. 

Also, my wife has worked with a lot of trans students that aren’t ready to come out so she uses their last names. You might want to see if you can get that going as some sort of nickname?
I’m sorry he’s doing this to you. You deserve better.
Tell him you can’t call him Mr. _____ because that’s not his name on his passport and instead you’ll have to refer to him by first name, last name, and middle initial from now on.
Start calling him a female name or a slightly dirty name and refuse to stop. I’d make this dudes work life a living hell any way I could that wouldn’t get me kicked out. Idk if you have a hunting supply store near you but deer urine scent is an amazing way to ruin someone’s desk space or car if you pour it along where the hood meets the window.
Here's the thing, you can always just start a rebellion or just tell the school committee, it would probably get his ass kicked if you do that
This! 

One of my primary schools tried to expell me for my brother's bad behaviour so we told the local newspaper. I got A's that year 😂
I promise 100% that Admin is the reason for his change. I’m a teacher (and a cis ally, my best friend is a beautiful awesome trans lady) and I have had to do this. I have several kids who I HAVE to legally call by their given name and not the name they have picked. An email went out to all their parents outting them and telling teachers we basically have to act as if Trans people are a figure of our imagination. This teacher probably can’t explain why or face being fired. There is a trend nationwide of schools being sued for protecting trans kids and LOSING because the law says their parents are allowed to deny their trans identity. This issue makes me really upset
We don't have admin, and the principle doesn't care.
100% agree
I've talked to my principal about it. My parents agreed that it's fine to call me by my chosen name but the principal said teachers would be very generous to actually not dead name me, therefore deadnaming me is very much not a problem for anyone. They don't care
Depends a lot where you are. I know several gals in small towns who dread coming out or when they do, they're purposefully deadnamed a lot.
This is a new law that was being passed in some states last year, basically teachers have to keep using there dead name unless they have parents permission and have to continue with there pronouns
I could, but it wouldn't help much. The school doesn't really care much even though my parents agreed to me being called by my chosen name
actually i’ve never thought of it like that, that’s really smart
[removed]
I double this. Alternatively you can try to just ignore him when he calls you by your deadname, as it isn’t your name anymore.
I definitely supports misgendering him as punishment. Add Mrs. and aunty and lady and whatever else you can when referring to him. Bonus points if you can get a few friends to do it too.

Make it a thing around school where students compliment him about his pretty purse (when it's obviously a laptop bag) and tell him how that nude shade of lipstick suits him very well.

That'll teach him. If I ever went back to school, I'd wreak havoc omg.
my chaotic self loves this idea lmfao
Tbh this is exactly the level of passive aggression i would do in this position.
I am in Germany! I didn't know it was illegal??
[deleted]
This I would find an adult to get on your side - either counselor, other teacher or admin or your parents if they support you. Schools HATE it when parents complain
I'm in Germany, someone else said it's illegal here, but I've never heard about that
Sadly not everwhere. as i read her in other places in some states the parents have to decide that. thats so crazy.
As the OP pointed out, this is Germany. Everyone is required by law to have an ID (and no, you don't even need it to vote).
Probably the US. They pull this shit all the time. And it may not even be the teacher's fault. He may be a great guy, and he's threatened being fired unless he uses OP's legal name. A lot of states still do this bs.
It's so sad. I wish politics were not this important, instead if we could just be nice to each other. :(
Unfortunately this is a bad advice since it will only harm the studant side by getting bad grades, this situation should be handled in a more mature way with the school administration.
As a teacher im going to add that depending on the laws where you live, outing a student might be illegal and a student may have grounds to report if it happens to them. In California where I live it is illegal for teachers to out students sexual or gender identity to their parents without consent. Op, I would brush up on all legal protections for trans students in Germany and where you live specifically so you know your rights.
Oh I definetly will.
No matter how long it'll take, he mightve gone into retirement by then, but as long as he's alive I will not waste my chance of one upping that mf
Unfortunately no matter what I'd do, I wouldn't get support in any way.
My mom doesn't agree with my gender identity but left me the freedom to change my name in school, which is why teachers are even allowed to not deadname me. My dad doesn't even know and he'll definitely never find out cause I don't want him to write me out of his will.

The principle literally does not give a fuck, she said teachers can call me by my chosen name but don't have to. The teachers who were specifically voted to help students just go by principles order's so it won't help either way.

I'll gladly accept those trans dad hugs tho <3
Yes I literally just looked into the dgti passport and I'm pretty sure I'll be getting one. I'm so hyped that this is an option
The idea with the letter from the psychologist sounds so smart, I'm gonna see if I can somehow get that. I do have a really supportive psychiatrist, Tysm for that advice
Fr
I just edited my post, I'm in Germany
I love this comment
An easy option is to refer to him by just his first name, or if he's married ""Mr. Wife's Name."" You're technically not wrong right?
I don’t *think* this is a thing. I couldn’t tell you any school districts that have the workers to enforce that. Also most districts could not care less what name a student is using in class. We still use their legal name in grade books and the like but inside the classroom when directly addressing students we can call them whatever name they want us to call them. I have several students that have different names than their legal name especially some that have chosen an American name to go along with their original name (I teach at a school with several first generation students with parents from outside the US). I also have several students with nick names or just going through their own identity journey.
Ich muss ehrlich sein, bis jetzt hab ich nicht wirklich geschnallt dass der Lehrer mich überhaupt diskriminiert weil das deadnamen so akzeptiert würde von der Schulleitung.

Ich bin 16. Meine Eltern sind beide Transphob und mein dad weiß nichtmal direkt davon dass ich trans bin, er weiß nur dass ich nach einem anderem Namen gehe und der hat kein Problem damit. Meine mom ist ziemlich dagegen geht aber nicht aggressiv damit um, hat aber auch nix dagegen dass ich einen neuen Namen außer halb von zu Hause habe.
Ich werd mich übrigens mal durch das
https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/agg/
lesen. Das ist auch für mich interessant.
Solltest du auch. Du musst deine Rechte kennen.
This makes me feel so safe, thank you..

I have to be honest, I feel a bit pressured by people hyping up the idea of me being disrespectful back but I don't think I'm able to do that. I want to, but the teacher isn't the only one I'd be disrespectful to, I still have my whole class that's gonna be forced to listen to all the arguments I have with them.
This isn't the first time this happened either :/
Exactly. Plus, while for cis people it doesn't hurt to be called by their full name, it's humiliating to be deadnamed for me. I just don't understand how ignorant someone could be and still choose to actively work with other people.
Why, Im glad you're such a fighter. What a great personality. I'm so sick of having people tell me that if they were in my position, whether that is from being discriminated against, sexually assaulted, abused whatever, that they would've done something better than me. That they would've reacted differently which apparently means that their reaction is objectively better. Regardless of whether your reaction would've been better, doesn't mean everyone is capable of reacting that way. 

I came here because I needed emotional support, I have no one to talk to about these expierences and unlike your greatness I am not ""brave"" enough to do all the great things you would've definetly done in my situation so I asked for help.

I'm glad that you have the guts to not have to cry about something that happened to you on the internet, I don't. 

You suck.
No u
Where am I being selfish? I expect to be treated with respect. That's not selfish I just don't hate myself
No wtf? This is about my name, my identity. I don't have to care if his poor feelings are hurt by me using a neutral name. Fuck him and fuck you for even thinking like that. He's being incredibly disrespectful, he's not the victim.
I wish
That's a shit ton of money and I'm a minor with unsupportive parents. I don't deserve to be discriminated against because of my shitty situation. You suck
German name changing laws are horrible. It's really expensive and takes pretty long (I'm not sure if you have to be 18+)
Well, I could try, but it's not really a thing here
No but I expected basic respect.
Well, Germany isn't as progressive as it likes to look like. A lot of these things are just blindly being tolerated cause people are scared to speak up, including myself. So while it's less supported, this behavior is being tolerated a lot.
The term birth name makes me uncomfortable since people keep telling me that my birth name is more important than my actual name.
I don't want my birth name to even exist. It should be dead.
Getting a name changed is pretty expensive and my parents would never let me do this so I gotta wait. I will be getting a dgti pass which is basically passport with my actual name and gender ^^

And I really do like all of these ideas, and of course yo appreciate everyone making the suggestions, but my fear of authority combined with my fear of men really doesn't allow me to do much. I'm glad I've come far enough to talk to him at all.
What messed up 'sins of the brother' logic is that
I got sent to the deans office three times in one day my first day of middle school. I’d had three siblings and four cousins go through before me, and most of the teachers wouldn’t even read my full name in attendance before sending me up. It was so bad I had to change schools.
WTF. This world is sick
That is evil.
It may be time for us to start riots again and sue for attacking trans kids
This is horrible :( I can't imagine how much it must hurt, both for the kids and for the teachers that are allies. Having to knowingly deadname a trans person or face losing your job would rip my heart out.
Even if the rule was created it doesn't seem enforceable. Why don't teachers just ignore it and call people by their chosen names? Civil disobedience you know. If you do somehow get caught you can always make the excuse you thought it was just a nickname and cis people have nicknames all the time.
I work in IT and as a teacher for a public school district and I am trans as well, so this, in particular, hurt me more than I thought possible.  We have a trans student and he wanted to go by his chosen name.  I attempted to make this change to his email/windows accounts so he didn't  have to see his dead name everytime he logged in or read a simple email.  But was then, promptly, yelled at by admin and parents that I am not allowed to do that since the parents absolutely refuse to even acknowledge their real child.  Admin had no choice, but personally had no problem with it, so please don't bash all admin.  In the end, my hands are tied on this one since me doing it any way and losing my job wouldn't actually do anything for this child since it would be promptly changed back.

Fact is way to many people in general are so stuck in their ways and refuse to see anything beyond their extremely narrow vision and until we, as a society, collectively pull our heads out of our asses, those of us that either support trans people or are trans peope, are stuck in a not great place.
Good lord, seriously?

When I was in high school, I very distinctly remember having a “preferred name” section on the personal information forms we updated every year. Even before I figured out I was trans, I had a different name that I went by, so I always took advantage of that. My preferred name showed up in yearbooks, my student ID, even class lists— I’m pretty sure no teacher knew my legal name, and I’m *actually sure* that none of them cared (but then again, this was ~15 years before the “trans panic” of today. Also it was in Canada)
What the fuck? What country is this?

Britain?
Honestly if I was in school while I was transitioning I would have just not responded to the wrong name. 🙃
This makes me so angry
what country? i’m not american btw
Oof, this puts a whole new sinister twist on things 😔
Are you allowed to give kids nicknames, like Sport or Princess? Maybe every kid could pick a nickname and you could use that out loud? Or introduce a secret agent theme into your lessons and refer to them as Agent 'Codename'? Just add a Carmen San Diego vibe?
If this is true, and I don’t doubt it is, you should tell a trans friendly media outlet.
No offense,  but this is stupid.  You just point at kids and don’t even bring up their name.  “You.”
That's disgusting. I'm actually considering being a teacher and thankfully I live in a Blue State. If a school forced this on me I'm not sure what I'd do.
Tell me you live in a red state without telling me you live in a red state.
I would get fired before deadnaming or disrespecting someone, but I know people have bills to pay and can’t always lose income. This is just an awful situation created by bigoted, ancient administrators with their heads stuck in the 1950s. This
Post the school and have a whole bunch of randos call in to complain.
Scare the pants off em.
That makes me wonder who is giving these orders then?
It’s going to be challenged and likely overturned because it violates Title IX of federal law, but it’s going to hurt a lot of people until that happens.
OP is in Germany, not the States!
They're in Germany. 

But yeah, what absolute nonsense. Also, you just know they're pretending it's to ""protect"" very small children from being ""confused"", but it will mostly affect high schoolers.
On the flip side, in California it's illegal to use a person's deadname.
Implications of what? Respect?
I did this with my family. They stopped deadnaming me within days, lol.
It isn't just passive aggression. On its own passive aggression is pointless.

There's an endgame, to make the teacher responsible for their fuckwittery.
I found this link! https://www.deutschland.de/en/topic/life/against-sexual-discrimination-lgbt-rights-in-germany

The first entry in the list, beginning with the title ""Which Laws in Germany exist to protect . . ."" has some information. Your professor is CLEARLY being transphobic, so I am certain that you have a legal standing to fight back against him.

A second option also exists: if the administration will not support you, then go to the media! That would definitely be a difficult and painful process, however. 

I wish you luck! You deserve to be called by your REAL name, and your professor better recognize that too!
I couldn't find anything on the subject... but that's probably because I'm an American googling this stuff in English

I did find something about a law from the 1800's that forbids degrading another individual in public... so that may do the trick
Local news outlets would LOVE to air this story. Contact local media.
There is a court ruling from the Landgericht Frankfurt vom 03.12.2020 that says explicitly that your Chosen name and pronouns must be used by every insitution and cooperation. Even before they are legally changed. because of article 1 2 and 3 of the Grundgesetz. You can find that ruling online through Google. If you need help with this you can dm me.
In which City do you live? Contact a local support group, they can help you better than me. No Matter where you live, you can contact the Rubicon in Köln. They are really good and well connected and will help you over the Phone.
You voted for them to represent the class so they can speak for the class. Even when they have no formal power alone the fact that you elected them gives them legitimity.
Did a bit of research and found [this](https://taz.de/TransPersonen-in-der-Schule/!5728383/) article.

Short version: 
There are people trying to make it something illegal (for example the Arbeitsgemeinschaft „Queer-Grün“) but it's not a big enough deal to count as an insult even when done excessively. 

I also found another article about a politician constantly misgendering a trans politician but there the court decided once again that it doesn't count as an insult


[here](https://www.anwalt.de/rechtstipps/ist-es-eine-straftat-eine-transsexuelle-beim-deadname-zu-nennen_170619.html) is the article about that
That’s why I said depending on the state. Mine requires teachers to legally.
Is Bavaria a relatively transphobic state in Germany?
Yup, I see that now that the edit was added.

That is unfortunate that a school in Germany is that way. Boo on them.

What kinds of IDs normally have? Is it common for that required ID to be a passport? Does a country wide or state ID double as a passport or get auto-linked to one?
It’s Germany
I agree, if this was extended family, or friends then the advice given would be really good.
I am pretty sure the teacher legally can’t punish the student for failure to respond to a name that has clearly been communicated as not preferred. Its called discrimination and retaliation. I would def get admin involved first, then if they do nothing, the school board and threaten to take it to the media or a lawyer for discrimination. It will surely light a fire under their asses to do something to remedy the situation.
With a bit of luck the ""Selbstbestimmungsgesetz"" will come through and it won't take too long
i just read your other comments on this thread and i’m so sorry you have to go through this. i don’t really have any advice to give, or anything like that, but i wish you the best, and that you overcome this ❤️
I'm so happy I could be of any help! I've seen a French documentary some time ago about a very young (like 6 yo or something) kid (amab) who realized they were trans. In this documentary you follow her and her mom dealing with shit like this, and her school is also not really willing to accept that the kid can come to school with a dress or other feminine clothes. Eventually, the kid and her mom go see a specialized doctor and this doctor also accepts to come to her school to talk about gender dysphoria and transidentity. The school finally accepts their demands but only because they have a proof from a medical professional. The context is slightly different than yours but still, I think medical doctors can really have a big authority in this kind of situations. I'm very glad your psychologist is very supportive! 

Again, wish you all the best! I do hope your situation gets better! :)
[deleted]
Yeah
i totally understand. you dont NEED to do anything. you need to be comfortable. thats the most important thing.
If you can’t respect other peoples ideals, they won’t respect yours.
That's completely understandable and I'm sorry for your troubles. People who say that are ignorant assholes. I assume you're not 18 and can't legally change it yet if that's what you want. Keep your chin up and don't let that kind commentary get you down. Not long ago being gay was illegal, and look now. Times are changing and they'll all feel like major idiots eventually.

Keep being you!
He did break the headmasters nose so I get hating the family but I was 8 😂
Oh yeah. What makes it crazier in my school is that it has created a weird sub-group of the Trans kids who ARE allowed to be out and excepted because their parents support them. So the kids who’s parents don’t support them get outted by the school, shamed and forced to go by their dead names. But kids whose parents support them get supported by the school reluctantly.
Oh yeah 



Lets just burn everything
I was just about to say that about it being sick!
Yep. I was just thinking that this is grounds for a lawsuit at the federal level in the US.
Violence is not the answer. If we start riots then we’ll have every normie in America crying out to “stop the trans menace.”

You can’t always beat and burn and shoot your way out of every situation. More subtle methods are more effective here.
Absolutely. I do everything I can to support those kids. On Fridays we have a secret lgbt+ meeting in my room where they can just hang out and be themselves. Sweetest kids ever!
I do call kids by their chosen name as much as possible but if I get fired in this small town I won’t get another teaching job.
I would use their chosen names and accept the risk of being fired. Once I was terminated, I’d file an EEOC complaint and hope it gets sent up to a higher court. I’d be willing to take the fall to get these laws changes and make sure that no kid has to go through life hearing “deadname, deadname, deadname” the way I did as a kid.
I agree it’s not all admin. My administrations hands are tied by the school board all the time.
In my workplace (also education) we changed all accounts to use student numbers rather than names.  It was done in order to protect identity but had a positive impact to avoid deadnaming, which wasn't unnoticed by the student body.  I'm lucky as it is quite a progressive and understanding workplace, most staff use gender neutral terminology when addressing students.  Maybe approach your admin dept/superiors with the suggestion of applying this to your institution with the angle of data protection?   Play the system.
Right. I haven’t actually *gone by* my deadname since years before I transitioned, and a lot of places ‘back them’ had a preferred name slot. 

I think they assumed that it was just there for John who goes by Jack, or Karen whose first name is Lisa but has always gone by her middle. 

Once they realized trans people were using this to use their true names and be themselves, they put a stop to it quickly.
Southern USA
You realise teachers like umbridge and trunchball are largely made up? Lol 

British schools are largely very dull places with teachers that don't terrorise children. In a situation like the above they could call social though on parents who try to insist on dead names. Just for a nice chat...
lol, that actually makes sense, imagine if that became a new movement
Lol America. I’m in the south specifically where conservative asshole Christians rule
This is the southern US I would be fired and not able to support my family.
I’m sorry but what? Where was that said?
I'm thinking about it. I'll try to speak with my principle about it once more, if she refuses to do anything about it, Maybe I will
I have no idea. I just know that my parents have to agree that people are gonna call me by a new name, which they are. But other than that, I just know what the school psychologist told me about what my principal told her basically
Yeah, they have several years to enforce it and come up with other laws that will have to be challenged.
It only makes sense. They want to achieve something by calling you. If you don’t give them what they want, they have to adapt in one way or another.
/u/yourdadsmommymilkers Definitely try to contact your local newspapers and broadcast channels. If there's one thing that German schools hate more than letting pupils stand up for themselves, it's having negative attention from media. Witnessed it several times myself.
There is a court ruling from the Landgericht Frankfurt from the 03.12.2020 which says that you have to respect the chosen name and pronouns. The court stated Artikel 1 the dignity of the person must not be violated, Artikel 2 every human has the right of free development of their personality and is protected from violence article 3 you must not descriminate anyone because of their gender as reasons. The court said explicitly that this is the case regardles of If these things are changed legally. The only relevant source is the selfdeclaration of the person.
What your teacher is doing is mobbing and punishable by law!
It's the Texas of Germany.
We have both an ID (called *Personalausweis*, literally: Personal pass) and a passport for international travel, but only the ID is mandatory. Of course, there also are driver's licenses, health insurance cards etc.

Most of times, you'll be asked to show an ID with a photograph of you, so either the Personal Pass or your driver's license.

Applications for IDs are possible with the local authorities, but both the Personal pass and the driver's license are valid in the entire country. States (*Länder*) have no role in the process AFAIK.
If the studant doesnt answer the questions for being deadnamed then its not giving answers to be graded, the mature thing is to sort the matter right away with administration, not with passive agression actions in class, thats just going down to the teacher's level.
Thank you so much. Having this many people support me actually gives me some hope :) <3
Letztes Jahr wurde versprochen dass wir gesiezt werden aber kein Lehrer hält sich dran, ich dachte nicht dass ich das verlangen könnte. Aber wenn das so ist, dann natürlich wäre mir das lieber
It's not about ideals, I don't care what he thinks of me. He has to respect me as a person. Not just morally but by law. And why would I respect someone being disrespectful to me?

Plus, whether I respect his stupid beliefs or not, he obviously doesn't respect mine so you couldn't be more wrong.
The plot thickens XD
I cannot decide whether that is better or worse. Overall messed up....
Ight I'mma build a rocket and terraform Venus to create a queer left community. Want to join me ?
I was literally told to stop being gay and ignore gay children if they are being abused at home.
Great…

State supported child abuse. There has to be a way to say we aren’t going to sit around and let this happen.
doesn't that create a divide between trans kids in there?
Tell that to history peace never helped anyone sure its a good sentiment but idly standing by doesnt do anything either be walked on or fight back even if I am too weak to I know just by looking at history if we dont do something we will be attacked again and again until we have nothing left we arent doing enough as it is
Honestly, that's really wonderful. Probably means more to them than you'll ever know. Thanks for doing what you do!!
That's good of you to do. You're a good person. 
It's really so serious that you can be fired? Wow. Guess I shouldn't be surprised; I found out teachers in Texas can't even strike without losing their teaching license.
There. But I believe you could get a job in other places. I salute your efforts, but if the worst happens… there are states really hurting for teachers.
I would say that you deserve to work somewhere better anyway, but also if you're gone, those kids have one less ally and get further isolated.
Fair enough. You have to do what you have to do to survive. It’s sad your small town is so bigoted and ignorant. I was raised in a tiny town so I know exactly how that mindset can be.
https://transequality.org/know-your-rights/schools

In the US, Title IX protects trans students. Sadly it’s a fight to have that recognized in some places and I totally get why people wouldn’t feel able to have that fight.

Would suggest contacting the ACLU if it’s an issue, and see if they’ll do the fighting part.
I was more referring to the general state of Britain as a country, in that it is highly transphobic earning the moniker of TERF island.
aw shit, i had a pretty bad feeling it was 😣😣😣

honestly, i hope things get better there soon
All in favor of building a wall at the Mason-Dixon Line?
Good luck! I'm cheering for ye. And if not I'll call and give em what for. I would also highly recommend you pass this on to local news/radio for some strong local pressure.
Of you're on a private school the school principal is on the top of the leader, if you're on a public school the Kreisverwaltung tells your school what to do
Sadly yes.
Sympathy from a US Texan to all German Texans.
Lol. 

How many mature teenagers do you know that aren’t angsty? While that would be the optimum choice and outcome you can’t expect a teenager to act like an adult, when the adult is acting like a child. 

Just saying. And they could still fight the ‘poor grades’ if the teacher is not calling the correct name. But honestly, the vibebI get from the teacher is that they would send OP to the principals offense after the first offense bc they see it as defiance because they are power tripping. Which would act in OPs favor because they then have a direct line of connect to the ‘big man’ to explain that they have a very transphobic teacher and being sent to principals office is proof.
[deleted]
I’m sorry you feel like you’ve been wronged, but don’t make other people uncomfortable
I would say this is worse, it’s segregation of a group that already faces discrimination on the daily.
Absolutely!
Oh my, yesss. Cloud cities am I right? Haha. Venus is a way better option for human colonization then mars in my opinion.
try moon or mars. much more habitable 😂
Too hot on Venus, go to Mars. Plus there would be some irony to changing mars from a hard rocky desert to a beautiful world full of life. Could even change the name to Marsha.
Isn't the second thing illegal? Aren't teachers legally required to report abuse?
Wait… what? Did you have to just type 
“I was literally told to stop being gay”? 
And 
“Ignore gay children if they are being abused at home”????

I’m so furious to read that. Not just because I’m an abuse survivor. Is there a way to help?
It does and it sucks. The ones whose parents support them want to help but there is absolutely bitterness there.
Sounds like that's part of the goal.
Oh yeah that’s in multiple states. You should read about the “parent bill of rights” that is being proposed in Texas. It’s already been used to say a gender identity book was pornography and it’s not even a law yet
Yeah and do you think I just randomly have the money to uproot my family to another state? I’m the main breadwinner in my family. I have a kid. Also do you know anything about the teacher market? The states that have problems hiring teachers are the ones that would do anything they can to deny trans rights. Also teaching licenses don’t always transfer. I can only teach in one state or go through a lengthy process to transfer. There are a lot of problems with what you are suggesting. Please go read r/antiwork to better understand what all workers are dealing with currently.
Wait, so ""I'm ok, so who cares about anyone unlucky enough to be south of an arbitrary border""? 

Or is it more like ""It's awful how trans people are treated there. To protect trans people, let's make it even harder for them to leave an awful situation.""?

I'm really confused about how this could possibly be a good idea.
I know you're joking, but that just makes it worse for everyone down there who ISN'T a lunatic.
Only if we leave out Tulsa D: 

The Pride festivals here get pretty lit. Loooooooooots of queer people here. I really have no explanation for it, but it's awesome. We have that queer critical mass where bigots just stop trying to do anything about it at all because they know we can outnumber them on a bad day. I fully recommend every member of the alphabet just move here so we can take the entire city as a bastion of Pride. We already have a rainbow street sign!

The governor is kind of a transphobe but we're working on it. 0 people respect him anyway.
Oh okay, naja ein versuch ist es wert, danke
[removed]
So question, would the best thing in that situation as a supportive teacher just to not refer to the trans students who aren’t allowed to be referred to correctly like as much as possible? Therefore you won’t deadname them? I’m genuinely curious because I want to be a teacher myself
Definitely. Venus's atmosphere can be thinned . But Mars's cannot due to its lack of magnetic field
Yes and yes
I did. Nope. Parents around here are hugely conservative and the police are currupt
fucking hell.
I will commit fucking propaganda of the deed
I’m not saying it’s easy. Not in the slightest.

I’m saying we need you. We need you badly. I hope the worst doesn’t happen.

It’s no fun working for a faith based organization who has the legal right to ignore any federally offered protections (what few there are) because they believe in a book that they ignore either. I’m in constant danger of being fired for being transgender. I’m also the main income for my household. I also have to have a license to do what I do. 

So I hope that will clarify that I’m not at all being flippant. You are needed.
It’s not your fault, and your decision is completely understandable. Always put yourself / your family first, and don’t let anyone guilt you over it.
Relocate trans people to above there and then wall.
>""I'm ok

Yeah that's a no chief, I'm in Narnia, I have to be, I may be up north but I'm in an area that's not a friend of the mafia. The plan would be to relocate the LGBT+ community and its allies north and send the bigots down south, to be with their kind.
The non-lunatics can leave
Really? Huh I live in Tulsa and am trans. Maybe I should get more involved. And yeah fuck that piece of stitt.
Tulsa? The home of Oral Roberts University and the Black Wall Street massacre? 

I value my freedom and sanity, so I’ll have to say no. Nowhere east of the Rockies and south of Kansas (except Key West).
Awww I’m so glad good people want to be teachers. I try to use their preferred names out of earshot of admin as much as I can. For me this is not a problem because in general our students are supportive of their lgbt+ peers even if most of their parents aren’t. That means I don’t get snitched on to a parent. I also just call on kids without their names all the time regardless of their identity. For example I’ll point to someone and say “ok go ahead” or “what would you like to add?”
Venus has also no magnetic field by it self my friend :p
Its existing field somehow is created by its clouds xD
Switch the atmosphere and the field is gone 😂
The kurzgesagt video about that was really fun
Precisely, and the gravity is way more similar to earths so it would be easier on any species that also go.
Magnetic field's not the issue, stripping by solar wind is quite slow (by human standards) and takes millions of years. The big issue there is its lower gravity
Some people just can’t wait to try
To make the world an ugly place.
My wife and I are planning to get a lot more involved with the festival itself this year (unless it's jinxed by covid of course.) They have an interview process to join any of the groups and events they do at the equality center, you know, to make sure you're not just going in to cause a scene ( or spread the plague) so it's a pretty safe place to go if you need support or any services.

But no seriously my brother has been methodically collecting and organizing every single mistake Stitt makes so that when ANYTHING comes up in conversation he can go ""Yeah, you know who's fault that is?!"" and proceed to give proof that the governor is just a dumpster fire of a person. 

Although I gotta say Texas has it worse right now, by far.
That’s really smart thanks for that I didn’t think of that lol
Wait, what? How is that possible?
I am aware of that but it is still a magnetic field that provides some protection, the denser atmosphere itself also provides some protection from solar radiation but I’m not sure that would make 2 snoots of a difference with a cloud city.
The gravity on Venus would be pretty close to what’s here on earth. Aren’t the planets pretty similar in mass?
We call them ""Republicans"".
This is entirely true
I totally understand why it exists, but the interview process would scare me away. I have bad social anxiety and have trouble “passing as normal” in pressure situations, and interviews fall under that. I get nervous in job interviews too. 

It’s sad this is even necessary, because bigots won’t stay away.
i dont remember anymore. i've read that on wikipedia. sure it's only wikipedia, but for science stuff its okish.
I meant with Mars; that's a big part of why Venus is better"	sbhmjh	trans	2173	0.92	2022-01-24 08:46:05
I sent an email to my managers after repeatedly being misgendered for weeks. Any tips on what I could have said better?		"Well done! You spoke very clearly and professionally. You expressed how it's affecting you and how you'd like to see it resolved. You were perfectly respectful.
Your language use was very kind to their side, acknowledging that learning and adapting to new info can take time.

A respectful request for respect, well written.
I think that's perfect.

It's sad that our existence is increasingly some sort of line in sand that others have drawn. Rather than your coworkers adjusting to your new pronouns and name, knowing it's important to you, but has no negative effect on their lives.

(Assuming I am not reading something into this that isn't there. In that case ignore me)
That's exactly how I would have said it! They need a firm but calm response from you that this is not how you want to be referred as.
Excellent job, Cole!
Honestly, this seems spot-on, to me. The tone is diplomatic and respectful, while also making it clear that this is an expectation, not a timid request. You're asserting your rights, not asking for special treatment.

You handled this perfectly 💜
I'm a trans woman and I work in corporate America and this is more gracious than you even needed to be.
perfect 👏
I think you wrote it perfectly :3
You don't expect perfection, but damn this email is close.
I personally would've written 'quite' instead of 'pretty' and 'such as' instead of 'like' for formality, but otherwise I'd write essentially the same thing. Of course, this also depends on specific work environment
Much better than what I'd have written. I don't know if I could have resisted the urge to begin the email with a greeting of ""look here, fuckers""
My only (minor) complaint is to stop softening your feelings for others. Don't say ""I was pretty uncomfortable."" Just ""I was uncomfortable."" Women, and people who were socialized to be women, often have issues with asserting themselves and it's scary, but don't minimize your feelings, especially since you want them to take you seriously.
That’s perfect as is , professional and too the point
Looks really great
My example of the pronoun thing is this:
Letting someone in while driving during slow, heavy traffic isn’t something you are required to do. Obviously you already have the right of way, and technically that other person just has to wait until there’s a break in the traffic right?  That’s “just how things work, right?” But you sure like it when someone slows and waves you out. It’s called being considerate.
There is no way that email could have been worded better it's literally the perfect way to go about this. I'm sorry this has been happening to you hopefully things start improving soon.
So this happened once with a boss at work. I had changed all my paperwork already. But it was only one guy everyone else caught on very fast. I straight up ignored him. Using the wrong name…… must not be talking to me
I think you worded it perfectly. I wouldn't have changed a thing
I really like you email! Well done and good for you!!!!
No, yeah, what you said was how I'd have put it! Clear, concise, and professional while giving your coworkers some grace in adapting to new pronouns
I think you did great with the email. You were respectful and professional. You made it clear this is not a request. I hope they realize that. Best of luck with your transition.
Had a lawyer send it lol
I’m proud of you for sticking up for yourself and agree with the other comments. The only thing I would add is, if this is a major corporation you work for, keep a copy of the email you sent and any positive evaluations you’ve had recently. I know there isn’t supposed to be retaliation for sticking up for yourself,  but some people are really petty. Keeping the email with any positive evaluations would help in any wrongful termination lawsuits you might end up in.

If this is a small, privately owned business, anti discrimination laws still apply but are much harder to prove. It helps that you like the people you work with so you’re going into it with a positive attitude, but you never know how some people (particularly people in positions of authority) are going to respond to something like this.
That’s perfect and now you have a paper trail if it gets any worse. If it does, you got a pretty easy lawsuit there
I think you expressed yourself in a professional manner, respectfully asking everyone to do something reasonable and not difficult.
To be honest, I feel that using the incorrect pronouns or name to refer to someone, anyone, transgender or not is toxic behavior because I consider it to be disrespectful and emotional and mental abuse. You definitely did the right thing and I would keep pushing it until it's set right. No one should have to deal with toxic behavior and I just recently dealt with toxicity from a manager of mine and reported ditecy to them, their district manager, director of operations and HR and nothing got done so I walked out and quit.

Again, good for you!
That was spot on, no change would improve it - well done to assert yourself perfectly!
Wish I was brave enough to write email like that to people in my college. But most of them are very homophobic and I don't have good relation with them. Only a few of my friends and college psychologist know
If it continues, contact a lawyer.
That there have been an increase is kinda saddening. That means the misgendering isn't innocent and most likely purposeful :<
Fuck em sue for sexual harassment.
I woulda been a lot meaner so you did good and were professional
Perfectly acceptable! It's professional, it's concise, it leaves room for growth and an open conversation, it's a straightforward ask and informative. I would absolutely feel great about receiving this if I were a Directeur, and feel good about being that example for others and making concerted effort to take clues from you on his to tell everyone else. 

I would suggest that you have a plan in mind that you want implemented. If you simply want management to respect your pronouns, perfect. But you can't expect them to make that announcement to your coworkers, so you'll need a plan on how you want that communicated to your teammates but otherwise it's really well done!
I think this is pretty bloody perfect!! Well done you! It shouldn’t be happening, and this will weed out the lazy idiots from the people genuinely making an effort :)
i'm so proud of you standing up for yourself
Were you fired?
My employer tries not to but they slip up every once in awhile...but they did tell me would take them sometime getting use to. So maybe that's the cause...hard to change for some.
I wouldn't take offense receiving your email. Au contraire, it would help me be more understanding.
Sometimes need more time for adjusting, my family a bit confused too, but I can understand them, my way was hard and I was thinking a lot of years, but they got it only in one day.
Did you CC HR? If not, forward this to them.
Well written and very concise and on point. My wife is trans and she has some friends that use they/them pronouns and it took me a while to understand. Hang in there. With some practice people will definitely get used to your pronouns. Sorry if this doesn’t help but I tried
Probably should have signed your preferred name
I literally have just had almost the same issue at one of my jobs. I dress fem but a manager kept referring to me as “fag” or fag boy” or “faggot”. You handled it extremely well I wrote a similar paragraph and signed at the bottom “I quit” and walked out the door and the company owner called me begging me not to quit because they know how valuable I am. Well……A month later and that manager is no longer working here
Did you include HR on your email?
Wonderful letter. Request a professional Trans Ally Training for all staff from HR. Even if only the managers can do it, that would be great!
Have you considered adopting a more feminine name?
And I expect... People to take some time to get used to the new normal. The first part of a change is often seen as a trend. 

Also... I think asking always works better than demanding. 

Just my twopennies worth. Stay cool.
I think you did a great job.
Maybe after the not expecting perfection part you can indicate what they should be doing. “In the future, if you accidentally refer to me using masculine language, please correct yourself to feminine or neutral language and move on.”
Nope it sounds great. I would include you pronouns in the email signature so no one can say ""uh i forgot""
Well done
Your mistake is sending the letter to your managers and not HR.
Nah this email is basically perfect, you were completely clear in what you want without coming off as rude . Good job 👍
I like the people I work with. I'm going to give them the respect I think they deserve until they give me a blatant reason not to. I never ""officially"" came out, but I did start wearing pronoun pins and all that. So I'm gonna give them a couple weeks and then escalate to HR if need be
""Listen up chucklefucks, I'm only going to hold your hand and walk you through ***how gendered pronouns work*** once.""
Hm nah cuz u dont have to let someone in when driving but u really do have to use the right pronouns. They have to know its a requirement not an option whether they like it or not. Being misgendered really hurts, its more like telling an anorexic person that theyre fat. Like anyone else wouldnt like being insulted (if fat is considered an insult) but its especially hurtful to that individual. 


A pronoun is a fact, its nothing to do with respect or being considerate. We call hitler by he/him, not out of respect or consideration, but because its just terminology to refer to someone with so ppl know who ur talking about
I haven't changed my name just my gender. I wish I could ignore the one person, but that one person happens to be my shift lead more often than not. If I did change my name however I would act like this. That's absolute queen shit
Lol
I'll go HR first. I know they're not your friend but it'll definitely help or give me more means for a lawyer
If they fail to respect this accommodation, then yes fuck 'em.

But every one deserves a chance to get it right.
I'm going to file a formal complaint if this doesn't go well. We sadly don't have HR onsite because it's a retail store.
IMO, You should probably come out officially. Is Cole your preferred name? If it's not, I would add your preferred name as well. Otherwise, people can always say that they didn't know i
Or they didn't get the email. Good luck!
I agree that you were amazing gracious, and really admire your measured approach to something that is a really big effing deal!! Huge fan!! This will clarify to everyone and make your expectations crystal  clear, remove any questions people might have had but possibly didn’t ask so as to offend you maybe? Hopefully that makes sense, it’s meant to be supportive of you!
Never trust your bosses. Under capitalism all employers take advantage of their workers. By design, businesses have no affection for their employees 99.999% percent of the time, and when they seem like they might, it's usually performative. Standing out by doing anything other than making them money can easily go so so wrong, especially when seen as a liability.
It might be a bit late now but I do highly recommend people e-mail their colleagues when they come out.  You don’t have to tell the whole world but at least the people you work with or are likely to work with on a day-to-day basis (that list might be a lot bigger the higher you go in corporate).  This gives everyone an early opportunity to start to learn and adjust, where pronoun pins and that sort of thing can be easily missed/overlooked or not even understood by those who aren’t familiar with trans issues.

When I came out it was a pretty short and sweet e-mail indicating they would see/hear changes over time and requesting they use my new name and pronouns.  Took 1-2 months for everyone to get it right I’d say.

Some people may also be confused about when to use she vs they or her vs them.  Personally if you told me those are your pronouns and I saw you presenting female, I’d likely default to she/her in 90% of cases without thinking.  If people are saying he/him and you very obviously look feminine, that’s not cool though.  Some people may also default to male if they’ve only heard Cole as a boys name.
“Listen up chucklefucks” is pretty up there with ways I dream of starting a company wide email….
I think your email was great. It was the right move to make. Professional. And it was a boss move because I am the shift lead. 😇 the new boss is very old school let say that. We worked it out now that he got over himself.
Yes, this. But remember, the corporation is neither friend or family. Do not hesitate to take legal action if it becomes necessary. But going to HR first can potentially strengthen your case.
Weeks of getting it wrong?
Corporate retail generally has regional HR.
Yes and if you’re seen to be doing the right thing it removes any question of you being litigious just for the sake of it. So annoying but unfortunately true.
dropping the nicety language: you want a record of communication so that you can prove the employer knew that the harm was happening before you sue.

make sure you win before you fight.
That's why I'm CCing my personal on every email I send just in case they get delete happy

What about me looks fem?? I got misgendered and didnt talk and had my mask on 🥲🤨 (ftm)		"Look male to me
I have found, some people get triggered internally by our presence for whatever is going on within them, and then they say stuff out loud to intentionally misgender us - ""ma'am, ""that's a woman,"" ""that's a man"" etc. just to gaslight us. 

I read you as male. It's clear and obvious. You pass. **Ignore them**
I really don't know. You look straight up male in this picture. I'm sorry you got misgendered :/
there’s nothing here that screams inherently feminine, honestly it probably comes down to mannerisms/ how you carry yourself.  if i saw you in the wild and didn’t know, i would gender you based on voice and mannerisms. 

that, plus i saw you say somewhere that you had a smaller frame- bigger clothes will just make you look smaller/shorter. 

for more tailored passing advice i suggest you look into r/ftmpassing
All these comments about eyebrows… as someone raised as a boy and transitioning to a woman, some guys definitely have nice eyebrows like his.

You 100% pass in the picture. I’m sorry you got misgendered.
maybe your framesize? you could try a good shoulder/neck/back workout routine. this could enhance you masculine appearance. i think you already look masculine. young but def masculine. :)
You look like a dude to me
You look masc to me, but your eyebrows are thinner then most men's (tho I will say thicker than most women too), while it's not a stand out thing unconsciously it might twig to someone? I had/have the same issue as mine were too thick and I'm trying to neaten and thin them would getting too thin.
Your skin being softer as weird as it sounds might give it away too? Women tend to have softer skin so perhaps you encountered someone who just paid really close attention or just guessed?
Overall tho you look like a guy to me, if I saw you in the street I wouldn't really think twice, cause ya know you are a handsome dude.
Eyebrows I'd say, they look too neat and not bushy enough, and due to the mask it's suddenly a way more noticeable facial feature. Besides that you look very masculine!
Ngl I thought you were a guy trying to pass as a woman, so you're doing fine
I do think its a little bit about your eyebrows. Unfortunately it’s not even that people are paying attention to the eyebrows specifically its bc people just have it ingrained to sort people into “man” and “woman” and do it unconsciously. i do think if you got a brow pencil or something, darkened them a bit, and maybe made them a bit closer together in the middle it might help you pass.
I honestly don't know. You look masculine to me :)
I always fail to clock anyone on this sub. I'm like yeah they don't look the most fem. I see why they might have been clocked, oh wait they're ftm? Passing with flyer colours to me
You look very much like a dude to me. Maybe it‘s your movement or something like that?
I'm not even like trying to be nice you genuinely just don't really look female at all idk how people would misgender you
hi, can i know where you got your shirt please
Small frame. T shirt and sweater are baggy and they look like small sizes. Eyes also give away a little. I’d say just bulk up a bit. You def look androgynous to me. Maybe stick to black or solid color masks. Men are less likely to wear cute ones.
Your eye brow is what is giving you away . They are not bushy enough
I think your most feminine feature is the eyebrows, but even still you look very masculine. I think them misgendering you was just an attempt to put you down, you look great!
Nothing at all? Normally i can tell gender by faces (I still ask for pronouns) and my brain went to male?
Eyebrows and nails are too nice
Cute male 💕

You don't look fem at all! I don't see how you were misgendered, either?
you pass as male imo, I know others said eyebrows but i personally disagree. I never look at someones eyebrows for gender clues but thats just me jskskksksksk
You honestly look like a guy to me
I clocked you as a guy at first WTF
Honestly it might be your shoulders? Maybe they’re small?? But I’m not really sure… I thought you were a cis boy off the bat :/
r/FTMpassing
You Look more Male then me(pre transition mtf)
I'm gonna try not to sugar coat this while not being a b***...I always expect honest and blunt when I ask as a mtf....first quick glance I see neither male nor female. So then I stop to analyze....the eyebrows don't quite match, the fingers give you away, the skin looks to smooth and soft for male. I realize there are men that are just pretty....but as someone transgender the look just doesn't work well...just as there are tomboys but as a transwoman I look too masc with that style....
I'm annoyed because I disagree with most here, you do read a bit femme to me, so I thought I could hopefully offer perspective, but I'm also super new to all this so I'm having trouble pinning down _why_, especially things you might be able to do.

I might try different hairstyles maybe, a bit more forward?  Or posture, to try and make your shoulders look wider?

Sorry.  I hope that helps, like...at all.  I believe in you dude, I know you can figure out your look.
Your skin maybe?  Idk, You look like you passed to me but you do have super smooth skin.
I think you look very masculine. Nothing about you looks fem to me.
Not sure but in my opinion you’re passing and on top of that really handsome so they’re probably just blind.
Your eyes and forehead are MASCULINE. Your brow is protruding even. Your look very young but not fem and I know fem...
Istg transphobes probably misgender cis people on a daily basis bc anyone they see as not stereotypically masculine acting or feminine acting “must be pretending.” You deadass just look like a guy and it was probably an unlucky guess.
The only thing I can think of is maybe your hairline but honestly you pass rlly well
I have no clue how could someone possibly misgender you, you look more masculine than some cis guys I know.
I didn’t read the whole title, mainly the ftm part, and I thought you were asking what looks fem to see what you can change to look more fem, you look very masc to me. You look very handsome
Nice t shirt! And i have no idea why you were misgendered, you totally pass
Man i think we had the same shitty day. I feel you bro. Had been feelin great about myself until suddenly i get misgendered twice on one day by different well-meaning (i think) people after quite some time of everything going well. 
You pass well to me, I'd definitely think ""guy"" when i see you.
I couldn’t even tell ya, you look like a man to me
nothing fem
You’re the guyiest guy I’ve seen in a long time
I'd say facial structure seems a bit feminine and maybe the shoulders as well, but it's more you look like a slightly feminine man rather then a women.
I thought this post was the other way around, lol. I was left thinking, sorry, there’s not really anything that stands out as feminine to me.

In your case, that’s great news! There wasn’t anything to my eye that stands out as feminine. Probably just people being dumb.
Look like a boy to me. A young boy, but still. People misgender other people all the time, not just trans people.
If I had to guess, you do have a slightly smaller frame, and smaller hands, but that's it. But honestly, I would have still read you as male.
Bestie, you look handsome af, you dont look fem <3
You look like a male. I’m the same way if it helps you feel better. Our presence is just so much more powerful and confident than the transphobic people that they guess. Your so much stronger than they ever will be. You look masculine.
Literally nothing. I'm as confused as you are. If I saw you in public I'd assume you were a young adult male
You pass completely as a younger dude, imo- the eyebrows /could/ be more messy but I don’t think that’s the reason. I guess it would depend on how you carry yourself? Idk.
I think maybe the oversized clothes but aside from that you’re masc to me
I saw you as a man, you pass

But I do feel you man, I also look very masc and some people still call me ""she/her""...
Wtf you look like a dude, no cap.
They’re being weird I believe that’s all.
Also, where did you get that inner long sleeve??? I want it so bad now
A little something from a cis male that got misgendered half my life on various occasions: Noone is gonna look at the details or how every detail may be more or less masculine. The first expression is all that matters, and there some people are just really bad at getting the right impression. Like ""small frame, longish hair, no visible facial hair"" is often enough to be classified as a girl. Even with my clearly male voice, no female features whatsoever, I couldn't convince those kind of people that I am a guy 😂
So don't let it get to you, happens to biological males as well
Hard to say from this photo. I would recommend posting to r/ftmpassing. Is this the first instance of misgendering in a while?
You very masc (though granted also very young looking) so most likely it was just the moment. As in the person didn’t get a good look or they might just have a default gender of referring to people along the line of something fem (ie Mrs or ms). There might have been a chance it was your frame and height. From this picture you look pretty square but if you were hunched over or at an awkward-ish angle that might have effected it. And I saw that you mentioned you were shorter again that could have been it but I’m a 5’11” trans guy in my 20s and people are still convinced that I’m a 12 y/o kid (and the gender fluctuates based on who is looking at me when and where). From what I can see here though, I agree with everyone else. You ARE MASCULINE no doubt.
Probably mannerisms / voice / stuff you can’t tell from a photo since you look fine
Nothing look feminine at all! People do the same with me. It must be because our voices dont sound exactly like the apparently 10 other man theyve talked to. Either that or the pants you were wearing were fractionally too form fitting and they assumed because you arent built like a fucking twig you must not be epic buff man. Seriously though i feel your pain. Id vote it happens to do with your voice as im ftm and look very masc but people call me “maam” on the phone because of my voice.
Honestly I don't fuckin know, you look like a typical male to me. I feel like they do it to us on purpose sometimes. I get the same thing too sometimes and I pass decently, even my voice has dropped much lower and it happens still. 
Try not to worry much about it, my dude. you're a stud no matter what and you pass just fine. 😎
same thing happened to me (and i was really masc that day), transphobic ppl do that shit on purpose
Maybw your hands? At first I thought your eyes but then your eyebrows and hair were screaming masc to me… honestly idk but I’m sorry, that sucks!
I know I'm one of few but I look at hands and skulls before I see teeth eyes  or even a lick of character, 

And ye my mind says girl as soon as I see your hands, but as my brain continues to process the entirety of your character, my mind lands in the
 ""sup bro"" area 

Alot of comments were short winded  so I felt I should toss my coins in and ye I hope you don't get miss genders in the future, and I hope you have a solid weekend my dude
Eyebrows and hair a bit
i know the baggier clothes help hide your build, but it could very well be a mix of height and body language. especially how you hold your shoulders, hands, and legs.
You look pretty androgynous tbh. I think this is a case of someone not being able to tell your gender and just guessing rather than use singular they. They had a 50/50 chance and they guessed wrong.
You look more masculine than Bieber at his teen years. You just look very young. Sometimes people are up to get you but others they just innocently read us wrong. Just remember that what others think matters nothing to begin with. Others opinions of you is not something to spend energy on, specially if they are strangers. At least that's how I go about it being a trans woman myself.
100% a guy
Maybe your hair? Idk. It doesn't look girly to me but it could to a random person on the street
They did it on purpose because of their own inner struggles. Dont let it get to you, its happened to me as well. Your features are softer but you still look like a dude bro. Just know that beautiful people are the target of some ridicule from haters.
It's the walk loose the light in your eyes and give a bit more weight in your step too
Perhaps internalized homophobia at oneself led someone to misgender you due to an attraction they felt. Their reaction to this feeling may have been to misgender so as not to accept that part of themselves, not the other way around 🤷‍♀️
People be like ""look at those feminine pupils""
[deleted]
Straights being stupid just to set anyone off, thanks ma’am, sir whatever to make you get upset.
Absolutely nothing. It sickens me how people assume genders.

I've been misgendered too my bro. A lot of people assume I'm a guy friends ""girlfriend"". I'm a demiboy, who is by birth female
[removed]
looks a lot like a woman for me. Sry, i would have also called you a woman if i had talked to you
I thought you were mtf for a second, but you look pretty masculine!
I have the same shirt you’re wearing on rn. But honestly I think the person who misgendered you is just a dick Bc you look fully masc to me
Your hair kinda
Eyebrows, rings, earrings, posture, and you have timid eyes. Fem to me
Well kept eyebrows and the ring
I think a lot of People just immediately go ""that must be a girl"" just because it doesn't fit their standard of masculinity , my boyfriend is a Trans Man and just really looks like a boy, maybe a lot younger than he actually is but people always misgender him and we just don't get it. Luckily we live somewhere where we can correct people and most of them use the correct terms after that
I honestly can't pick anything out specifically, to me you pass well. Maybe it's just because you look young (trans men tend to look young. I'm 23 and look 19/20). I grew up in an area with lots of religious people (of all kinds) and they might see me as a male but because my voice ruins it they just say ""ma'am"" or ""miss"" because they realize I am a trans person and they don't like it. Maybe just analyze who you're around, it might be a situation like that.  I'm gendered correctly by strangers more often (like 80% of the time) now that I live in a larger city that's also a college town. It might just be that you look young imo though, you could also start to see how you're movements and posture could present more ""masculine"", sounds stupid but I foucused on that when I was you get and it helps
I guess you have smaller than average eyebrows? I dunno you seem more masc than fem to me, more than I did a few years ago, (Bigender AMAB)
You definitely pass as a man. It reminds me of how i get called sir with a feminine pink haircut, and a v-neck with a visible bra.
I don’t see anything about you that’s female or feminine. Who ever misgendered is definitely in the wrong here.
I don’t think you look fem at all. If I saw you walking by I’d assume you were a boy.🤷‍♀️
In this picture, I’m not sure. You don’t look fem at all imo, so it was probably your height (if you’re on the shorter side). Otherwise idk :/
To start off, you look like a guy. I think you might be partially having a similar problem to my (cis) brother in law who has a really young face and so sometimes gets clocked as female. If I were to pick anything out that would indicate fem, your eyebrows are much better kept than most guys I've seen, but I feel nitpicky even saying that.
Idk you pass
Probably the skin but guys should be jealous of that cause clear skin is good, idk u look androgynous to me
You don’t look fem? You pass fine
honestly nothing IMO! you have big eyes which could be read as feminine but lots of cis boys have big eyes. u look great ! no idea how u even could’ve gotten misgendered, people are weird.
Idk depends how u carry yourself cause guys definitely have a different body language and also there’s some structural markers that I can’t pinpoint and they’re a bit fem, maybe the eyebrows?
The hair maybe?? Not really sure either
You are a awesome man,ignore the haters, atleast you have the ability and support to transition, you've had to fight to be where you are, Don't let others dictate how you feel
I hate to say it like this because for all Intents and purposes you pass. But even for cis men passing isn't enough all the time to not get intentionally misgendered. It sounds weird and it doesn't sound like it should happen to ftm but it totally does. The things I'm going to point out is that you've got soft looking skin, soft eyebrows, and a soft expression. Cis men have been called women for less. Food for thought. Best of luck to you homeboy.
Maybe hands??? I have no idea, you pass very well
You don't look fem

You look young for sure but you just look like a guy to me
I honestly tried to find something and couldn't.
Your eyebrows
Sorry this is off topic but what is the ring you're wearing? Like where did you get it?
Nothing. No idea what made you.
To be honest, I thought you were asking for tips to do mtf. Maybe that was just a fluke misgendering.?
You look more like a guy than I do and I haven't started my transition yet (MtF)
i’d read you as masc.  like okay i’m kinda gnc so i guess i’m not exactly king of passing but i could not read you as female
i get very young off of you but zero femme. you're cute, and pass, as much as i hate that word
I'm not sure what you identify with but if I saw you on the street I'd assume male. I'm sorry if that offends you! I think some people get offended when they see trans people too and will purposely misgender them.

edit: oh i just read your post title.. you pass! lol
I thought you were a guy from the get go, nothing fem about you at all. Very handsome I might add!
I mean you look like a guy but some people just seem to sleep better at night by purposefully misgendering people so unless they thought you were a butch lesbian maybe or smth then they were an asshole
if someone thinks you're fem they got brain worms
Sometimes it’s posture maybe they saw u at a bad time because if ur a blur and someone’s standing like more proper or fem than u can see them as something else at least that’s why I assume I’ve been called a girl when I still look like a boy or I’m just that cool but u look totally male
Tbh I've found it's skin texture that makes people gender or misgender. T Is so bad for your skin, pores are bigger, chance for more oiliness...and now that I havent taken it, even though I have a neck beard and a masc haircut and clothes and everything, even receding hairline and bald spot. And I STILL get misgendered, I've been on the shit for 4 years and now estrogen has taken over and made my skin perfectly smooth.
Tldr dont be hard on yourself. Sometimes/most times its something stupid you'd never consider. Theoretically femmes naturally have more features that clocks them as femme. If you're not on T, yeah, it'll happen even with a beard (if your voice is higher and you're short especially)
You look good though, I would not clock you as femme in anyway.
It is surely the eye brows, eye shape, and from what I can see the nose as well.

Either way just keep doing you.
People can be so cruel!
You look like a dude. Ignore the assholes. You pass
Not to worry. As you get older, your dominate trates will come out.
Cis people get misgendered too. And you pass perfectly visually speaking. The person is the problem not you
You look male to me. People are ignorant or stupid. Or both.
You look like a guy to me.
🙋‍♀️🏳️‍⚧️❣️
You are just young….and that is a good thing…try not to let what others think effect you ….you are amazing…that is all that matters
I misread and though this said mtf and was confused when I only saw male features so I honestly don’t know.
Your eyes.
I get that too!! I hate that!
maybe they knew you before you transitioned??? or maybe they know someone who did??? idk, i cant tell how they think ur a girl
I reread your title twice to make sure I wouldn't be misgendering you by saying ""you look like a dude"". 

So: you look like a dude. Either someone being utterly clueless or just shitty. Either way, it doesn't reflect on you, dude. ❤️
They must be crazy. You look male (and awesome at that).
I thought  you where  asking for complements because I assumed MTF
Your beautiful eyes
Before I read the whole title and saw FTM I just saw the picture and instantly read you as male.  I felt bad because I thought you were asking for validation as fem and I was looking hard for it but couldn't find anything that immediately stood out as fem.
You look young, but male. From another comment you said you were 15 so I’d say you pass very well.
⟟ used to have people think ⟟ was ⏃ boy and ⟟ honestly miss that also you check out ⟟ don’t really see fem here
You look more masculine than my brother and he's 23 with a beard.
All I get is teen- early 20s guy (kinda cute tbh)…nothin femme that I see!
yeah i tend to get misgendered a lot probably because of my body. in all honesty you look pretty masculine to me.
Asking why you look feminine is a dead giveaway
Ima be honest. 90% of the time unless you are rich and can afford a Nikita Dragon type transformation its pretty obvious who has transitioned. But not you - you pass to where I wouldn’t give it a second thought lol

Idk whats up with that person
It's absolutely impossible to tell why you were mis gendered from this pic. You look like a young boy/man here but depending on the persons pov and the situation maybe you looked somewhat feminine at the time. Maybe they were on the fence and went with their gut idk.

I do know one thing even with someone's voice you can't always be sure. Used to do customer service over the phone and it was stressed we never gender anyone because mistakes get made constantly.
Eyebrows maybe? But you also look male to me. Or anything it’s prob height but I saw in the comments u said u were 15 so make sense. I also think it’s Bc ur hair might be a little floppy. Maybe if you styled it differently? Idk im trying hard to analyze and i can’t rlly give u a good answer or reason as to why other than maybe the shit I’m guessing.
You don't look female at all!

It may have been your voice, but that's just me!

You look amazing!
What??? The only thing I would say is maybe your hair … But even so it is very short and masculine. Possibly feminine because of how straight it is? Have you tried getting out of bed and not giving a fuck about your hair? Before I transitioned to female that’s how i rocked my hair lol. Hope my answer helps.
T changes your skin to be thinner and have a different look to it.  Without it, biologically speaking, you look prepubescent to at least some degree as long as your skin doesn't have many lines and creases in it yet. 

So, I'd have likely assumed you were a boy or possibly transmasculine or something rather male, just not old enough, unless I saw you in a more adult context, like if you were buying something in public.  Various ways of standing or just having adult agency while looking underutilized makes people guess gmboys are women and women (or others) are boys.

That said, you look great, you simply appear to haven't yet had the structural and epidermal changes from T, DHT, and other sterones so you have a look like a young teen or a young adult who looks like a teen due to those ""lacking"" attributes, which is totally related to people's traditional beliefs about biology being destiny and all that crap. 

So, if you care what people like that think, you'd avoid extraneous thumb rings and anything else just like the homophobes to in order to ""try to pass"" in those closed minded circumstances . . . But it's far better to begin doubling down with dismissive statements if you, like other young men, won't take kindly to being called whatever you were called that made you feel like you don't pass . . . Because I think you do in all the right ways for a silent person with the right posture and clothing, but you have to press back by laughing or snorting at someone's mistake sometimes.
I’m not sure if this is applicable to this specific interaction but
In my experience I have found that their is an unfortunate group of people who are so dedicated to hating trans people that they’ve taught them self incredibly rigid gender rubrics that the average person would never think of 
“Trans Women have big wrists and heads, trans men have feminine eyes or are short etc” and by judging people against these very rigid expectations they’re able to clock otherwise totally stealth people. 

The thing to keep in mind though is these bigots with absurdly rigid standards are basically guessing blindly and also frequently Mis gender cis people (sense these rigid standards are stupid and bult on stereotypes and western standards)

I don’t think you look fem at all but if someone had a conspiratorial view of trans people and expected a rigid adherence to definition then they may have judged you and deemed you not a man, not because you look feminine but because you don’t look perfectly masculine

I assure you that you do not look feminine 
You look totally male
You rock
Ignore people who say otherwise
You're a man. Period. Some people are just stupid.
Literally nothing. If you hadn't said, I would have assumed you were cis and just really young. Someone has a soggy hotdog bun for a brain.
i honestly don’t know, man. happens to me too and it sucks.
Absolutely nothing
I literally can’t see any possible way someone would see you as fem. I’m really curious as to how they would think that.
Nothing about you looks feminine. They must have really poor eyesight.
I don't see a thing about you that looks fem a genuinely thought you were a cisboy. Maybe you have a high voice? But idk cause I haven't heard it
You pass well,  ignore the bs 💕
You look like a few cis guys I've known lol. Whoever it was must have picked up on something, decided you were trans, and then decided to intentionally misgender you. I've seen cis people get misgendered by transphobes thinking that they did something.
I really can't see anything other than the mask choice, but then again I've seen cis men wear way more flamboyant masks 😷
You look masculine. Not hyper masculine, but most guys aren't hypermasculine. Honestly can't place anything, I could understand if someone who saw you thought you were female but my reaction would be male. If anything it could be facial fat deposits but that really is the only thing I could think of and I'm grasping at straws here.

Sorry you got misgendered, I don't think it's a you problem.
Try a solid black/dark color mask.
Not me studying the image world forever, trying to figure it out- you look masc to me my friend
It might just be size honestly:/ smaller amab’s prolly get it too:(
To me you look clearly male. Don't know how you got misgengered. I'm sorry btw
I read U as male. At first glance u look male. Upon further inspection u look male. Only thing is ur eyes/eyebrows. They look very slightly femenine, but like even then that’s probably just me being tired after my pfizer vaccine

Edit: Yeah, another look at ur eyes, and they look totally masculine. U look completely cis male
You look like a handsome man to me idk
Eyebrows could be thicker, it its possible. Look p fem otherwise!! :thumbs_up:
As far as this picture goes I would say you pass really well, though you may have gotten misgendered by the way you carry yourself. I know that is one of my biggest giveaways is how I stand and my body language. Don’t overthink it though. You look great 👍
I honestly have no clue, you pass rlly well
IDK mate, you don't really look fem to me
you look like you could be a cis man, you kinda remind me of the character ""Billy"" Loomis from Scream. But I think you and that character have fem characteristics cause sex is on a bimodal spectrum so we all mix and match characteristics from our parents. Things that are ""fem"" about you but don't make you a woman are; you look to have clear and smooth skin, you're eyes are deep and big, I'd assume you're figure is small (which can be exaggerated by your bigger bag clothes) but the voice is usually what gets everyone. I have very feminine features naturally (mtf), long eye lashes, big eyes, thick flowy hair, and as a kid people thought I was a girl, until I hit puberty which made me the tallest, deepest voiced, and strongest jaw in school. I was a late bloomer and most of my childhood I was the small, high pitched voice, flamboyant kid, and if I had grown out my hair as a kid I would have 100% of the time be assumed to be a girl. While I still have those feminine features (and more from HRT) I'm still clocked as a dude cause of my voice and height, I also don't vocal train or act/dress fem cause I've been more comfortable as a tomboy (which I always felt jealous of my tomboy friends cause I was just a boy, I couldn't be a tomboy) but it's so tough to judge ourselves by our outward appearance, you are a man, that's it, you will get misgendered because you're trans, and it will effect you more than when cis people get misgendered because you are trans. I'm learning to embrace it when I get misgendered and confidently correct them when it's necessary, I don't correct the the clerk/attendant/cashier when they say ""how can I help you **sir**"" and just let it role off cause I have more things to be worried about then someone calling me he/him/sir/man in some understandable situations. I can't tell you how to feel, but I think it's healthier to become at peace with people misgendering us so when someone genders us correctly it uplifts us, instead of feel like you should look a certain way for other people to gender you correctly, that's how we take our power back. End of rant
Your hair seems a little like a tied up look that girls usually have
Male passing 100% honestly, dunno how you got misgendered?
frame
at first glance i thought you were mtf and sad because you looked masculine
Idk ppl weird 🤷🏻‍♀️
 I wouldn't worry too much.
Idk you just look like a little boy 😂 I’m sorry.
The way your eyebrows frame your eyes, and your smooth forehead to a lesser extent. However, most cis men have feminine qualities as well. I think it's probably due to your mannerisms and/or voice.
Nothing as far as I can tell. Idk maybe your legs or your walk? Something I can't see in the pic basically.
if your short maybe thats why because most pepole considere guys tall
I need more perspectives in order to answer that question, you look like a around 14 year old boy to me, but might be boobs or hips that we dont know of.
You look male to me but maybe because your wearing baggier clothes
Just be who you are .. it's harder but worth it. Dont let YOU be identified by how you look. It doesnt matter if you look like a beauty queen or a football player. Roll with your heart. You look great!
I believe it could be your overall build being quite lean. I've been gendered female before being out by someone likely for the same reason, as I also have a very lean build. It's really nothing much you can do about it I'd say. Maybe hormones will help? I wouldn't really think too deeply about it tho. You're looking handsome!

While you have some subtle feminine traits, I've definitely seen cis guys with equally fem traits. So ye, don't worry about it (I know, hard to tell a trans person, I know as a trans person who hates being misgendered xD). Sometimes people are wrong even with cis people :p

Only partially related, but I'd suggest splitting your hair on the side instead of the middle. There's nothing wrong with having the split on the middle and lots of cis guys do too, it's just because I think it could look good on you, maybe. Your current split looks great too tho, so please don't take this as an insult but rather as a suggestion for an alternative you can try :)
Dude the only way you would be clocked is something slipped with mannerism. I don’t think it’s necessary but working out the upper body might help. Mostly biceps, triceps, traps back and shoulders. But honestly all I see is a typical gamer dude.
ur shoulders, also if u are shorter thats probably why
I get misgendered every day, 6 yrs on T, even when I have stubble. I think it's my height lol who knows?
You look good dude
My voice is deep and I have facial hair and I still get misgendered.  You look like the guy you are.  I don’t see anything that would make me think otherwise.  Keep your head up, man.  People say shit because they’re miserable in their own lives.
I mean hell i thought so, but then i got misgendered and was like ""what how??""
:[
Heh. Got it. 👍🏻
It may not have been on purpose. Why make this about hate?. If you think they did it on purpose then you must believe that they perceived him as having been female. So it could also be a genuine error.
Yeh :[
I was going to say this. Posture is one of the biggest things that got me misgendered before T. It could have just been your vibe in the situation. Eyebrows etc aren't likely going to get someone misgendered unless they're like pencil thin lol. 🙄 Also sometimes cis guys get misgendered in a moment. I was ""misgendered"" frequently before transitioning. 🤷🏻‍♂️ Try not to let it get you down.
Good advice 🙌
I mean sure, but nice brows do read more fem. I think he passes, but if he’s looking for something to work on….
I do my brows for sure but they are shaped differently. That's all I got, and it's kind of a reach TBF.
Haha 
Well im 15, but very very smol lol
Thank youu
Thank you 😊
They're fine tho? He looks like a guy who takes care of himself, not like a girl
This would be the only thing I would say. Even still, some people have gorgeous brows they don't need to touch. I don't think OP should worry about it too much, because they still present very masculine. But if it distresses OP,  what are some ways to make brows look more masc?  I'm curious if others are in this boat?
Heh thanks 😊
Same
I mean... it do be a little ✨gay✨ sooo
If I remember correctly, khols. Maybe
I cant help the baggy clothes. My dysphoria has been kicking my ass lately. Baggy stuff is the only thing i feel comfortable in. Plus im cold natured and its freezing where im from. :[
:[ thats so small tho. Like bro, who's paying that much attention to someone's EYEBROWS.
Heh thanks 😊
Thank youuu! 😊
Hahaha thanks lol
Im 15 and rlly rlly smol. Like 5ft smol lol
Hah. Oh my. 🤭😂
Yeh possibly
Heh thank you. Ive been wearing my mask at school tho i dont have to just to help with dysphoria with my face :[.
Heh thanks!! I get compliments from friends a lot saying they like my eyes lol 😅🤷🏻‍♂️
Thank you
Heh thank you
Thank you ☺️
Hahaha thank you
Thank you! ☺️
Haha yeh. I mean i know i look like a 10 y/o boy, but still. Lol
I mean i am typically more fem, but not on like a female level but more like... a gay level ig lol. Idk. I usually dont mind a more fem look, but my dysphoria has been rlly bad the last couple weeks. So yeh. Fun times 👍🏻🥲
Hahaha i don't remember. But thank you
No. Happens more often then i like to admit. Especially at school.
Yeh. ✨Fun times✨indeed 🥲
Yeh. Its exceptionally annoying 😤
Haha yeh. Honestly i dont mind looking androgynous. Nor do i care what pronouns ppl use for me, as long as it's not female pronouns, im good 👍🏻  lol
Thaaanks! I didnt rlly let it get to me. But it just confused and irritated me cus i didnt wear anything rlly fem today lol 😅🥲
Hey, just here with a warning for everyone: u/ClassicStutz is a massive bigot who trolls trans people into ""helping"" him, then proceeds to berate and harass us. I've got 30 pages of evidence, if anybody needs to see it. Please do not engage with this bigoted asshole, for your own sake. <3  
  
MODS, PLEASE BAN THIS GUY!!!!!
Right tho?? Holy shit. Hahaha
Pfft is that sarcasm? Like is that meant to be funny cus it kinda is lol
Yeh. Like stop assuming bro, its not cool 😤
Incorrect, but thanks. A for effort sweetheart! 👍🏻
Thanks!
Funny thing is... i dont do anything to my eyebrows... :[
Heh. I dont do anything to my eyebrows lol. Theyre just... like that
Also my sister who’s nb/butch lesbian aesthetic (her words) (also she uses she/her/nb pronouns and stuff so I use the fem ones cause it’s just habit and feels more personal and she doesn’t mind) has that same haircut so that might also contribute to it cause that haircut to me screams masc presenting but lesbian/fem identifying. Hope this helps somehow
Hahah yeh i know. I look like a 10 year old boy lol. My height doesnt do me any favors either
Well one of my friends gave it to me. Its a fidget ring. It spins. She knew itd help with my anxiety at school. If I remember right, she said she got it (along with others) off of Amazon.
Idk. Ive been told my size coulda had something to do with it. 🤷🏻‍♂️
What the word pass? Lol 😂
Thank you love! 😊
Heh thanks love
What do you mean? Like in the sense i was hiding that im trans?
Hahaha thanks
Yeh. I understand that. Which is why i limit my speaking at school, cus my voice gives it away so bad. 🥲
I have like a fem/androgynous voice. I dont mind it sounding androgynous, but its not like its doing me any favors with passing 😅
My hairs down in this picture, tho i do sometimes pull it up. Somehow, its something my dysphoria lets me do lol
i don't see anything that makes you look feminine
Hahaha na its all good. I fully acknowledge the fact that i look like a 10 y/o boy lol.
I really dont see how maybe they see something i dont
I feel you I get misgendered at work all the time by restaurant guest. I wear a name tag as well with a masculine name, we're in that time now when people act like they can't read anything.
Eyebrows
I agree with bi_dad. Although and I don’t want to sound judge mental or mean maybe they saw how slim you were and thought you were a girl,I’ve  heard that eating meat makes you gain more muscle you could try that?
Yep, I have cis male friends, look just like me (bald, full beard, ride Harleys, conceal carry etc.) who are on the shorter side and believe it or not, every once in a while they get this crap too...(quite a disorienting dilemma for them when it happens- lol). 

**it's gaslighting.**
Agreed. You look like a 16-19 year old guy 🤷‍♀️
Don't listen to those who are saying it was on purpose. They don't know that. Dont let people make you hate people for no reason. Even if it was on purpose it means that they recognise that you were once female which makes the error just as possible. 
If you want a serious answer to your question, it's likely your build. From the picture I would totally see you as male but it's often the shoulder build that let's ftm down.
I said ""I have found some people....""

I did not use absolute terms (all, everyone, everybody, everytime, in every case etc) nor did I make a statement as if to imply absolutes.

Gaslighting often comes from a place of fear and ignorance not hate. I also believe it reflects that the individual maybe struggling with their own GID/SI but out of fear cast that internal conflict outward on the unsuspecting person. 

The OP seemed mystified and without an answer so I suggested one possible scenario. That was all. 

Please stop casting judgment,assuming things,  and implying hate that isn't there. The words you have chosen come across like you are trying to pick a fight with me. 

Thank you.
Mtf here, I always had my eyebrows plucked femme even pre transition and it just got me complements on how nice they looked. Never misgendered with a beard, without a beard occasionally would get people asking questions (I waited tables so I interacted with a lot of people). People like to stick there noses where they don't belong to feel better about themselves. Keep doing you and don't worry about what other people think! 

For the record, I just read you as young male ☺️
A hairless chin and upper lip “reads more fem” by those standards.
ok easy! good time to start a workout or maybe a testosterone therapy. both in combination will give you a hypermasculine boost if you looking for that. wish you all the best for your journey!
No worries, I think someone else mentioned but with a mask on eyes are drawn further up the face so it could be why if thsts the reason, sorry you had that happen I feel the pain tbh, suppose its easier for me to take off then it is for you to grow it so I sympathise. 
Hope you have a good day regardless bruv and keep being handsomely awesome.
✨ Gay ✨ sounds great. Don‘t change a thing 👌
Thank u sir💜
Transfem here, the eyebrows are a much bigger thing than you’d think. From the pic you posted it looks like you should pass, but in motion and in context, eyebrows can really make the face seem more masc or more fem.
It’s surprising what brown lines do to your face. I should know, I have the bushy eyebrows of a bear
I'm not the one that was asking the question.  Besides that you don't even know me in the first place and third pretty sure I will not be the last one to tell you that
They aren't consciously paying attention to him. 

In general, most people can look at almost anyone else's face and without even thinking about it correctly guess their gender. They aren't consciously observing their bone structure, eyebrows, lips, etc.
felt. I’m also only 5’1 and get misgendered a lot
But i look in General shit
Damn I feel u ngl, don’t worry too much tho as long as you’re comfortable it should be no one’s business
Anytime <3
Ofc! If you ever feel down, lmk. I gotchu
Remember, you are powerful and strong. Let no one tell you who you are or burn you out. Your amazing as you!
I feel that. Honestly the metric to pass with cis people is insane sometimes. If someone’s homophobic around me it’s like a guessing game of whether I pass as a gay man or a masculine gay woman. I’m sorry your dysphoria has been so bad though, misgendering definitely makes it worse.
If you feel comfortable posting some full body pictures we can give you detailed advice on passing and honest feedback.
😁understandably so. Just know that you're beautiful and when you're beautiful weird stuff happens sometimes. Its the universes way of saying ""you still got it.""
Ikr
Lucky you lol….if I don’t keep up my brows I look like a Sasquatch. Btw, I think you come across as male pretty clearly, just trying to help by picking out the things that might be seen as feminine.
Oh nice!
yes, that word. i never passed as a man or a woman 🤷‍♀️
Lol no prob just trying to help
Under the trans sub reddit. And btw you pass dude, really well I’m jealous.
You also look rlly cute btw
Yeah, i suggest looking up some tutorials for male voices for passing but overall very masc
O kk
you sound cool as fuck man, i’d grab a beer with you (if you’re comfy drinking, i know some people aren’t no pressure :3)
...how? Na i look 10 lol
Whilst you didn't emphatically state ""this is exactly what happened"" its implied by it being your only case scenario. Also the ""ignore them"" adds emphasis to this theory. There was no ""but that might not be the case here"" anything to that effect. 
OP asked what it was about them that says fem. So you didnt even answer their question. Just decided to tell them that people can be ignorant. That's not what they asked. Anyway I wasnt intending to start an arguement, there just wasnt need for negativity in a post asking a simple question. Good day.
It does.
Uh. Yeah. A lot of trans men do or want to grow beards and mustaches
I would do that... if i could. I mean, i guess physically i can, but not mentally. Due to what happened in the past, i cant rlly work out without panicking. I can try, but it's kinda hard.
Will do 😌
Youre very welcome 😌
...i wasnt trying to be rude. Sorry...
🥲😶yeh
Haha will do
I was having a rlly rlly bad day, and you just made it slightly better. Thank you ☺️
Aw. I like that. 😊😊😊

Haha yeh. Its all good 👍🏻
Hahah why thank you
The respect here is awesome! I get go much flack for not drinking because I have an auto-immune disease. I appreciate it even though it wasn't directed at me
Lol seriously. You've got a classic 90s high school dude vibe.
Sure, but guys don’t need facial hair to pass. See Michael Cera lmao I hope my point is clear now.
All good . Have a good day
yeah i mean it’s that, it’s people who have sworn off,maybe you just don’t like it. i don’t care for it much myself but it’s about the *sentiment* y’know?
Haha thanks 😊"	qguw0a	trans	1957	0.97	2021-10-27 11:50:55
Do you ever misgender yourself?	I do it on the regular and I'm so disappointed in myself	"all the time :(
I have a hard time using my name, bit feel giddy when someone addresses me by it.
Sometimes I misgender myself when I'm thinking of myself but I quickly correct it.
A lot. If I can help it I'll refer to myself as they/them when I'm telling a story about something someone said about me. My pronouns are actually she/her but I'm not out so they/them do just fine for the purpose of not causing dysphoria by using he/him. I do occasionally misgender myself by using he/him when talking to people and/or in my head.
Every time a friend or family member flubs I remind myself that they are undoing years of memory pathways that were reinforced every time they called me ‘he’. So long as they are trying it’s fine, right? So the same should be true for me too right? I’m trying… but more so than any other person I have forced myself to think of myself as ‘he’… to perform that gender, to not let myself slip… so more than my mother, my brother and my wife… who just have to undo the casual use of the pronouns, I have to undo the years of deliberate misgendering of myself. I am a woman… I always have been… I called myself a man for so long… so yeah… I slip up. “I’m one sleepy boy!… damnit?!?”  “Ima man of simple tastes… aw heck!?!”

Let your self off the hook babes, you are doing fine. X
All the time. 
Don’t beat yourself over it. It’s gonna happen.
Hugssss
I do when I really get upset with myself. When I do something truly stupid I call myself my dead name and tell myself not to be a stupid woman
How long have you been openly trans? I haven’t misgendered myself in months now. I think you’ll get used to your pronouns :)
Y'all are all wonderful and you all matter! You are valid and no matter what anyone says, you can do this! We're all in this together Transily
Just stop and correct yourself every time. That’s what I’m doing and it seems to be working… slowly…
Yes but I do it less and less as I keep transitioning :)
Yeah, constantly. It's frustrating lol
Not anymore, but I used to when I was first transitioning.
Happens all the time but you gotta remember that it’s a transition not a transformation, things are gonna take time and it’s okay to make mistakes.
happens to the best of us, but know its not a thing to be embrassed over
Less and less over time
In the beginning. It gets easier as you go along : )
Sadly often, especially when I talk of past me. But I'm getting better at using the correct pronouns.
All. The. Time.
Nope because I use all pronouns so I cannot be misgendered I do however deadname myself all of the freaking time
Yea, but I have no one in my daily life who genders me correctly anyway so of course I’d be confuse.
For context my pronouns are they/them but everyone calls me she/her
It's kind of awkward because all my friends have picked up on my new name right away and I still keep flubbing it myself lol
Out loud not so much, but all the fucking time in my head lol. It’s super annoying and adds to the whole feeling of “I’m lying to myself/not really trans” even though I know it’s bullshit and habits are hard to break etc
I used to a lot but now I'm just stuck with misgendering myself when saying sayings like ""can't a man-"" for example because I've never heard anyone say ""can't a woman-""
I did it this morning. It happens most often when talking about myself as a child.
yeah, all the time. i accidentally use she and my deadname n stuff when i worry ab what people think ab me. do u get what i mean? idk how to explain it
Huh, not really. I don't know if I have since I came out. Maybe once or twice?
I used to do it a lot but I think I’ve taught myself to not do it most of the time now
Sometimes. It fucking sucks.
Lol yep. Less now but A LOT at first. The hardest thing to get used to was thinking of myself as a girl in memories.
I've had to make a conscious effort to not use my deadname when I talk to myself.

Years of habit is difficult to break, but it will break eventually.
Constantly lol
Yea, like after like 10 months or so of being an Egg (still am) trying to figure out what I am, I’m now 100% sure that I’m not a guy, but like my internal monologue still sometimes refers to myself as a guy. Altho im still pretty early in this process and not out yet as I have not decided if I’m non-binary transfem or if Im actually a girl, so I’m not super upset about doing it sometimes. 

Also question I’m relatively new to certain trans-related terms and egg is one of them, like I’ve seen it used to refer to someone who’s trans and in denial and I’ve also seen it used to refer to someone who is like still figuring out what they are but most likely isn’t cisgender. Is one correct and the other isn’t? Or is one more correct more than the other? Are both equally correct?
Literally all the time, I'm so used to referring to myself as a he that I have to catch myself before I refer to myself
Constantly. My mom is better at gendering me than I am myself :'(
used to when i had horrible dysphoria, a female looking chest, and most interactions with people who assumed i was a girl. 

now it's very rare i might accidentally refer to myself as they, that's about it. people don't really misgended me anymore so if I'm called anything other than he I'm thrown off. 

All in all, i think happens to everyone within the first two years of transitioning unless mostly everyone around was supportive and open-minded from fhe very beginning, and even if transitioning occurred far before HRT itself. Don't feel bad about it. As long as you see it as misgendering yourself, it is. 

It took me a while to adjust to people calling me he, and my corrected name, not because I didn't feel it suited me but because for 18 years I was addressed as female and by a predominantly female name. Some of us take longer to get used to things, if it's been a while of transitioning. If not, don't worry, again this is perfectly normal. Your pronouns are yours, and what you are comfortable with. No one else on the planet has a right to alter them or force different ones upon you.
When im mad at myself usually
I have to do so because I am currently in an area surrounded by people who don't have the best opinion on the LGBTQIA+ community but the only time it really hurts me is when I accidentally do it in my head. Makes me feel like I'm pretending or something. I know that's not true but... it still bothers me a lot. :(
How do you misgender yourself? I usually just refer to myself in 2nd person when I'm thinking.
Constantly, but then that’s how youve been conditioned to think of yourself for however long, right? Takes time to get away from that mindset
At the beginning I did but now no
all the time, sometimes out loud in front of my friends who scold me for it
Don’t be 💜
It is normal especially in the first months of transitioning.
I misgendered myself until I started HRT. Then it just.. kinda clicked.
Yeah 💀 it’s super embarrassing every time
i do it when i’m thinking abt myself. like i’m lowkey transph*bic to myself :”(
Alot of the time, no. However I have found that I deadname myself sometimes. Makes me feel like shit when I do.
Yeah, I do. And I wish I didn't. But you know what? Fuck that. FUCK THAT! Don't be disappointed in yourself. You are so much stronger than you know and you deserve to be the gender you choose.
omg yeah but I tend to laugh it off
almost every day
all the time, i default to she/her in my head when referring to myself and immediately feel that uncomfortable feeling when you get misgendered lol
Occasionally
Yes
Im agender, so yes, I am technically misgendering myself if I use terms that I tell others not to refer to me as, but that's because I understand the whirling vortex that is my minds grasp on the English language, they don't. If I call myself a businesswoman I'm not misgendering, I just know people are not smart enough to be able to correctly extrapolate extremely incomplete data
me too
all the time. no one has ever not misgendered me. so i just do it to myself now
Anyone ever done it on purpose?
Yes all the time.Especially when I daydream.I am closeted,so whenever I dream abt something daily,something that can happen in near future and a like,I need to present as my assigned gender so other people I dream misgenders me which they r me bc I imagined them.
Yes, normally I'm my head but it does make me feel like shit everytime I do it
early on i did quite a bit, but once i was passing and around supportive people all the time i quit doing it pretty quickly.
Coffee shops are the worst. You have 2 seconds to tell the barista your name and boy howdy you better get it right first time.
Sometimes in my mind when I think about myself from a different persons perspective cuz I haven't started transitioning yet or for safety :')
i misgender myself 9/10 times on accident but when i’m really upset or having a breakdown. i *really* misgender myself. I get aggressive with it when it’s really bad and i just end up making myself feel even worse but idk why i keep doing it
yes
All the time
Once in a while, especially when referring to myself in the past.
Yeah
Yes it’s annoying bc I’m at a point where I’m where I’m not accepting it from my friends anymore, it hurts when they do it but then I do it myself five minutes later 🤦‍♀️
Yeah, at work, with my unaccepting parents, and sometimes just out of habit. Each time hurts, but we have to remember that it doesn't change who we really are
I misgender myself all the time, hell, I even deadname myself sometimes too 😅
Ugh! This! Occasionally, but the WORST is the reoccurring dreams where I’m being misgendered, misgendering myself, being deadnamed or answering to my dead name and occasionally dead naming myself. 
Anyone else?
Only when I'm referring to pre-transition me.  Even with that, it still feels so wrong.
Never out of hand, but in memories sometimes, or when thinking self referentially, as in how someone would reference to me. Yeah
Oh do I? No because I use all pronouns 😎
Very often, yes
Only once and it hurt
I can't tell my own gender sometimes, so yes
Yeah ;-; especially since in Russian there is a lot of gendering, even in first and second person.
Yeah i do that sometimes
i do
[deleted]
I used to all time- now I usually only do when talking bad about myself, I’m trying to fix that though!
I used to when I first came out, it’s not your fault. You were used to referring to yourself in a certain way for your entire life and that can be a hard habit to break.
I do it, too. I think sometimes I have trouble accepting the person I am. If I catch it, I tell myself that I don't have to hide who I am from others.
All the damn time

It's annoying, but it's normal

I saw someone compare it too when there's a new year and you keep writing the old year as the date. It's like that, but with name and pronouns.
Yep
yea i do that, its alright tho! Don't be disappointed in yourself, you will get it!
All the time
Basically all the time. Whenever I do use the correct things I find myself shaming myself and telling myself I'm not really trans
Yes
Strangely happens often when I talk about what my dog thinks of me 

The other day I said my deadname first.
Because my mom had a habit of first saying the names of the entire family before arriving to the correct one, so she'll say my dad's name my sister's name then my deadname and then realizes and uses my name. So she has inadvertently brainwashed me to use my deadname and then my own name 

Like what
Yes.
It depends on language.. im trilingual and my misgendering increases as the language gets closer to home
Yeah. I'm not out to anybody irl, plus even if I can use he/him I usually misgender myself because I'm used to saying she/her in my native language.
yess i called myself a fangirl yesterday lmao
I haven't misgendered myself in a long time. I've been presenting fem full time for over 2 years now so that probably has something to do with it. The longer you think of yourself as your true self, the easier it will become. You're just currently getting over the habit of only calling yourself your agab that you've been doing for years. It takes time and practice, but you will eventually manage to change your habits. Just keep at it!!
yeah :/
often, it's easy to do but when you realise it hurts alot
I usually don’t remember my dreams, but when I do it’s usually because I misgendered/deadnamed myself and wake up feeling terrible. I sometimes misgender myself irl, but I feel so much worse about my dream because it’s basically impossible to correct yourself
“Am I faking it? Is this why I can’t bring myself to take any bic steps?”
Yeah and that is really dysphoric

Or in my dreams when I'm a girl, and I'm like, no, that is not how it's supposed to be brain, that bothers me, I thought that we have already overcame the internalized transphobia (I'm transmasc)
yyyyyyyep, usually when the voice of dysphoria comes knocking to make me feel like shite :,D sometimes accidentally as well tho
Yes, but only because I'm not out publicly. But even then I try to use gender neutral terms, or refer to myself as a girl in joking terms. Sadly though, I have to refer to myself as a guy far too often
yeah, when i get misgendered alot by others i start to missgender myself.
Only a few times, and most of them were early in the process. My identity has integrated pretty tightly by now. Last time I think was a few months ago, when I was talking about aging to my daughter and said something about becoming an “old man”. I had never really talked about myself in that context since transitioning and fucked it up.

Worst things were the 2 times I deadnamed myself really early on while introducing myself. Both times, I had been talking to the person for a few minutes and my brain was preoccupied.
Hell yeah, I've definitely done it both socially and in my head. It sucks
PRE-T, I still do, even in my dreams I still somehow am weirded out whenever I wake up.
Yes
literally always
By now it's very, very rare, it does hit kinda hard when it happens though.
Yup, it's tapered off. I now only do it rarely, I think the last time was 2 months ago
All the time. Most often when I'm imagining other people taking about me. Even those who are aware and are respectful.
The first 6 months after I started transiotioning, it happened every day, but it is normal since I used my deadname and old pronouns for 27 years. It still happens sometimes, but less and less.
At the beginning i did, lately not anymore!
Oh absolutely-
Jup. Mostly because im used to get misgendered and or have no other options
I’ve been working at that. I’m happier when I don’t. Patience is key. 💜
I can't even force myself to. I get an overwhelming urge to vomit when I do
I do it in my head sometimes. When I am figuring out hoe to navigate a social situation sometimes I find myself slipping into really old patterns and I catch myself treating the situation as though I am a boy.
All the time.
Quite a bit and I die a little on the inside every time I do :/
I'm nearly 1.5 years on HRT and I do it all the time. Don't be so hard on yourself 😊
My girlfriend does, and honestly I have so many trans friends that I’m so used to correcting people on other people’s pronouns and by proxy I correct her about herself.
At first? Constantly. But as of now it happens VERY rarely.
Yes
yes all the time because im narnia level closeted and still tryna figure out what the hell i am so no at the same time? idk anymore
I can do it sometimes. It’s very rare to wake up, but if I have nightmares about the past 🤷🏼‍♀️
Unfortunately, yes. I’m not out to everyone yet and it’s killing me but I am terrified to tell my mom that her only daughter is FTM. 🤦🏽‍♂️ FML
Sometimes. Usually I try to erase the fact that I was ever a woman tho.
Not rrally but it took some effort.
Yep
Accidentally and it makes me die inside
my native language has gendered verbs and im in the closet so i have to misgender myself every time i talk to someone 👍
On occasion, out of habit. 20 years of being called a guy will do that to you. Been trans for 2 years and I still do, mostly when I'm thinking from someone else's perspective as my mother and some friends still misgender me
May be weird, but when I (ftm) dream I'm 50/50 on rather I'll present as male or female. In the beginning it really bothered me. I'd wake up confused and out of sorts, feeling like I was somehow intentionally mis-gendering myself, but now that I pass really well in my day to day life it happens way less, and when it does, it almost feels like seeing an old friend or watching a TV show I loved as a kid if that makes sense. I think that's weird 😅.
Constantly. My girlfriend is better about referring to me as a woman than I am.
Yeah I have, but I'm still not used to being out
I LITERALLY DID IT LAST WEEK AND I AM STILL CRYING I CALLED MYSELF DAUGHTER AAAAHHHHHH
everyday unfortunately, to please my parents
Yes! All the time. I refer to myself in the third person semi-frequently and I OFTEN use the wrong pronouns. Why????
When I first figured out I was nb it was a lot but it got better.  Now it's once in a blue moon and my brain short circuits for a hot second.  Not your fault though and doesn't make you less valid.  Hang in there I know it can be distressing
I'm actually surprised with how quickly I have acclimated to gendering myself correctly. I'll be thinking about people talking about me, or narrating what's going on like a book, and I'll automatically use ""she"" when speaking about myself. It's pretty neat.
 I’m gender fluid so I give myself mini gender crisis when let’s say I’m in a girl state (I’m mtf) and call myself a guy. Sucks a lot man
Yup! Especially because they/them pronouns don't work that well in my native language and I'm still trying to get used to it/its for myself
when i first came out and a couple of years following that i did sometimes but after starting hrt and aligning myself more with what i felt like i’ve stopped misgendering myself without trying! i think when others around you misgender you it can push urself to misgender urself. i’ve noticed as i’m more “passing” i and others don’t do it
Yes lol

Also because I go by neutral in English but my language doesn't have any neutral, its a heavily gendered language, so whenever I speak to people back home I can only misgender myself 🙃
Always. Have been seen as a quiet girl for years (I'm ftm) so that's what my brain defaults to saying that to myself... It sucks and I always think to myself ""if I tell myself that, am I really trans?"" anyone else?
I certainly have before, but the incidents are extremely rare now. I even dream of myself as a woman or a trans woman now. I wonder if there is a connection for me.

It takes a while for a self identify to change. I only realized that I was trans earlier this year, at age 59. 😳🤣 I decided right then to fully transition. Some friends who have known for years and didn’t transition right away seem to have a more difficult time with this. But anecdotal evidence is not valid.
not so much anymore. i only do it when i’m talking to my parents and even then, i tend to just avoid pronouns entirely. 

but it took me a long time to stop doing it, especially in my head. but i came to terms with the fact that i’m trans nearly 6 years ago, so i’ve had time to stop misgendering myself. i figured myself out around 12 or 13, and i was still misgendering myself at 15. it takes time, but you’ll get better at it. it hurts right now but just remember: habits are hard to break. you got this tho, i believe in you!
I used to, but now it's getting easier to get it right
All the damn time :(
Happens less and less for me. But... Yeah
All the time cuz I have yet to find a gendered term besides queer that resonates with me.
Typically this happens in my head when I think of what people may respond to me because I somehow refuse to have normal conversation I just need to think through the conversation before actually talk
All the time
Yeah, honestly it’s harder to use my pronouns than everyone else. I would practice it but I don’t really know how. Oh well.
Sometimes. But it’s because of a force of habit because I’m still in the closet, so I need to pretend to be a cis guy
I’m not fully out yet, so any time I’m in school I have to
Yup... I mean... I'm NB and don't care too much about pronouns but like my family is really good about they/them but I am terrible about it
Sadly yes, I have to at work and with some family members who don’t know I’m trans
I do it sometimes, or introduce myself with my deadname. I hate it
I used to,but now,im finally saying he in the mirror when i do
I think we just take the path of least resistance in our brains, if you use the pronouns you’ve had to use your whole life it’s just programmed into you. As long as you don’t do it maliciously or you’re not talking down to yourself I don’t think you should feel disappointed :)
earlier in my transition i did, but not even once since starting hrt i think
i always feel so invalid when misgendering or deadnaming myself
I literally was walking about this last night with a friend. I don’t say my dead name but I will accidentally say he/his instead of she/hers. But I’m only 2 1/2 months out so I try to give myself some slack.
Pretty regularly 😞
i do it a lot but it depemds on the language i speak and people i talk with, if its family then i need to misgender myself but in school i can use my real pronouns. and if i speak english then theres not so many gender words as in russian where like every word depends on degender.. so yeah unfortunately i misgender myself a lot and even when i am in school i sometimes musgender myself just because im used to it.. ^^
I'm in a liminal spot where I'm out to half the people I know and sometimes I wanna be like ""I like such and such as much as the next girl"" but realize some ppl don't know yet and I don't wanna get into it and so im like ""as much as the next........ person."" I also find that sometimes my inner monologue will misgender me, but then I correct it and feel happiness.
on thanksgiving my mom and i were struggling with the turkey and I said ""we need \[her bf\] to do this, he's a *man*"" as if i'm not lmao
I've done this, particularly when I first came out and began my transition. As time when on, I did so less and less, and now its pretty rare that I misgender myself. On the rare occasions I do, my friends and I usually just laugh about it and move on. Used to bother me thou.
Yes!! Mostly because I'm still closeted to most of the people around me so I'm bound to get it mixed up sometimes. There's nothing wrong with accidentally misgendering yourself I think most trans people do it at some point especially when they're just starting to socially transition
I do it a lot lol
As a native spanish speaker, YES EVERY SINGLE SECOND OF MY LIFE
ive gotten into the habit of using gender-neutral terms for myself
I misgendered myself sometimes when I was questioning but since then I haven’t done so a single time.
If I spend an extended period of time in a place where I'm not out, I get so use to being dead named I kinda forget I chose a new one.

ETA: Also, don't feel disappointed in yourself.  You spent several years (I assume, depending on your age) having to go by the wrong pronouns. It's a hard habit to break
All the fucking time. I think it’s natural. Your brain is making a big shift from thinking of yourself publicly in one sense to thinking of yourself publicly in another sense.
yep
it sucks
It takes a while, y’all!!! Don’t be so hard on yourselves!! It’s called a transition because it’s a slow change over time!! Keep your chin up
Yeah but it's getting better lol
Yes- and it hurts
Because of life rn and gendered language, all the time
It's more common than not, since I use gender neutral pronouns and my language doesn't have them, hence being equivalent to neopronouns here
All the time, but part of it is because I'm in a staggered coming-out situation. That, and I can pretty easily separate myself from my body and it doesn't apply directly to me when I do it. 

I don't know if that makes any sense, but long story short, yes.
Of course! It has been like 6 years since I came out as trans, but once in a while I use female pronouns when I talk about myself. I just laugh and go with it. After all, we have been refering referering to ourselves with our assigned gender at birth and sometimes (unfortunately) forced to keep using them even though we know that is not our gender. It's like an old automated response.
You know, it's awkwardly comforting to know that so many others often deal with this aswell :)
Same, I misgender myself often- I've gotten better at it being out to myself for over a year, but yeah I still do-
I catch myself sometimes when talking to the dog.
Granted, now it's gone from Dad to Human to Mom when referring to myself with pupper. And that's only tryign to relearn a couple years worth of habit.

Not that puppy cares, puppy just loves me.
Yyyyep. Not as frequently as when I first came out, but I still do occasionally
Sometimes when I'm talking about me as a kid
I do, but mostly because I have no other choice
Sometimes, but I honestly don’t care. Pretty sure that’s a label but I can’t find it lol
Everyday at work and with my family, pandemic threw me back in the closet. At this point I started smoking nicotine and quit going to do any doc appointments, hoping for a natural cause death.
Yes on purpose cause I'm not out to most people. When I'm with friends that know I still do sometimes but most of the time I'm good about it.
I reflexively introduce myself with my deadname....
I do every now and then
I misgender myself ALL the time, but what triggers it is usually being misgendered by others :(
YUP
doesnt happen as often as it used to, but when it did happen a lot it was a mega bruh moment
Only around terfs and other transphobes
Unfortunately yes
I mean I have any pronouns so I technically can't

But sometimes when people say ""boys are cute"" im like ""im boy"" but then im like ""no ur nb stupid how can you expect people to respect you as such when you cant even respect your own gender identity you spoiled gallon of milk""
Absolutely, especially when using gendered memery/phrases. It comes out of my mouth and them I get tuat weird feeling and can't believe I did it. It's a process of unlearning and relearning.
I still have a hard time using my name in public. It’s not that I don’t want to, or that I just forget…it’s just that I keep getting scared of what people will think of me. Cause I haven’t been able to start transitioning yet, and I don’t want to end up being attacked or insulted for being a “boy with a girly name” kinda thing. And sure, that’s probably very unlikely, but it’s near impossible to shut up my insecure brain…
well sometimes i misgender myself and I am correcting myself right away, always it happens' i feel like an idiot, probably unnecessarily but whatever
It depends who Im talking with... When I'm talking with myself... I never think with pronouns towards myself, and it was always like that, but when I'm talking with someone that I can trust and value, Im using my ""prefered pronouns"" cause they... Funnily enough correct me when Im not using any pronouns or I don't want them to feel uncomfortable using she/her... So im the end in depends... Even though IT shouldnt be like this... I was always like all or nothing, everyone or no one at all... And I kind of broke my own rule... but it is what it is... Maybe some day
All the time it’s hard in my head to refer to myself that way I am not used to it yet. I also have a hard time correcting people when they misgender me
All the time, sometimes even unconsciously. In my dreams, I'm always a girl. It makes me think a lot, like what if I'm not actually trans? In my dreams, I'm a girl, so I must be a girl.
I misgender myself more than anyone.
I did all the time for the first few months, especially before I was out to everyone in my life. After about a year, I mostly don't anymore, but there are the occasional moments
All the time. And I mean, I used she/her for 18 years before coming out so I understand I'm bound to mess us
I used to do it a lot. Sometimes I would use the wrong name or pronoun, but I stopped myself (mostly) after a few months
Yes, at least with my parents a lot. I feel bad for using my correct pronouns with myself... my parents are tr*snphobic so they made me feel guilty about it.
No
Unfortunately all the time!
Literally never, can't remember a single occurrence.
Yeah. More subconsciously than thinking about myself with the wrong pronouns, though. Like I'll subconsciously think of myself as ""one of the girls"" in the group, or ""the only girl in the group"" if I'm surrounded by cis guys. I don't love it, but I guess 13 years of thinking I'm a girl is gonna have an affect sometimes.

I'm hoping that now that I'm on T, this kind of thing will stop because *other* people won't reenforce this idea so much once I look like a man. I think we pick up on how others actually perceive us -- even if they're using the right names and pronouns, if they still see us as our AGAB it affects our own view of ourself
At the beginning i did. And i felt dysporia. But now i have practice my Brain to use rigth and no dysporia
the hardest is like when im saying things in the third person
Always.
Yeah it happens sometimes
i misgendered myself more than my partner or my friends do lol
Still early in social transition, so, yes :/ sometimes the habit sticks even when I'm around people I'm out to.
God YES I do lol I'm always like 😳😖 but hey the brain is hard to retrain
I'm still not used to referring to myself as a sister, daughter, girlfriend, etc... so I sometimes do forget. I even use the wrong pronouns at times when talking about myself in 3rd person which is really embarrassing 😔
No, it's easy for me thank god.
Yep 😞
Yes... while i still look like a male i will sadly gender myself as he/him
I do occasionally, It's completely normal. Don't ever think you're not who you are. Sending love and support your way <3
Yeah every once in a while.
When I'm mad at me i talk to myself as a guy
Yea, I used to say things like “I’m a _ boi” as a joke but now when I’m about to say that I’m like wait no
When I’m telling a story about myself that takes place before transitioning, everyone called me my deadname and I end up accidentally deadnaming myself when repeating what people said.
I address myself correctly every time except when I’m narrating someone in my head who doesn’t gender me correctly

Edit: spelling
Only around parents as I haven’t come out yet
I honestly do all the time, it's the same with my name. Sometimes it just feels awkward even though I feel like my name and pronouns fit me perfectly.
I’m practically forced to around family
Yes! I will deadname myself and use she/her pronouns on myself. I know I’m not a female though; I’m just very feminine.
Well. I feel attacked :,}
You called yourself and were called something for literally all your life, it takes time to change that, for everyone, and it gives some juicy imposter syndrome  which sucks for a while, but reassure yourself that whatever you're calling yourself is your name and pronouns, because it is, you are who decides what you are called and if you change your mind later it's also 100% fine, just pick whatever makes you happy
I used to, but it's been a while
I do, but it’s happening less and less with time. 🤷🏼💝
My dead name is really common round my area for some reason and also in my family. So literally every time I hear it, I turn around. So short answer, yes.
I feel really comfortable with my chosen name and never even think of my dead name anymore but I have yet to immediately think of myself as male and often try to avoid using pronouns in my own head. I hate it because I know I’m male and it feels so good for other people to use the right pronouns, but I still don’t completely see myself as male in my head. I’m hoping hormones will change that.
Yeah I have I try not to the level of guilt and sadness hits hard. I usually keep my shot neutral like I'll say I'm a classic rock fan vs a classic rock girl/guy my pronouns are she her. But I've misgendered and I'm like shit why'd I do that.
I don't usually do it, but when I do it my brother ALWAYS gets angry at me and says ""you're not trans, you see?"" and every time I have to tell him that I can commit those errors too
Yes. Did it just the other day. I also deadnamed myself! 😫

That said, only been ""official"" 3 months and out at work for 2.
All the time I only recently came out as trans
Sometimes
Sometimes, “As a gay gu-…*wait*”
oh my god all the time. it’s normal, it doesn’t make you any less trans.
only when i have to (like speaking in spanish)

otherwise i’m totally used to referring to myself as she
Yeah, I do it a lot and it’s the worst.
Being a hispanic raise in the male version of Spanish it has been genuinely hard to reroute my brain to speak in the female version
Only around people who misgender me. It’s like.. reflex. I don’t even mean to do it.
I just realized I was trans this summer and I'm still catching myself thinking of myself as a woman in certain situations. For example we have gender-specific words for pet parents in Sweden and while I've gotten pretty good at correcting people when they accidentally say she or my dead name, that one sometimes slides by. Also sometimes apps ask if you're male or female and it still takes me a couple of seconds to answer. I'm pre-everything so especially for fitness-stuff I wonder which I'm supposed to pick. My body IS female, and I store fat as such, but my ideal body looks like a fit male!
sometimes mentally
Oh all the time! Don’t beat yourself up for it. Remember that this is a change you are making too. It does not invalidate you or make you a bad person.
Every single day
I'm still closeted so I have to
Sometimes, it makes me freeze up whenever I do. I really hate it not only cuz it feels bad but it makes me worry that it makes others view me as less trans :(
Yes and I’m always pissed cause I’m like come on you’re meant to be on my side here
all the time
Damn I felt bad when I accidentally did it in my head bc I’m so used to hearing ppl call me she/her, glad I’m not the only one
Every so often when I use certain phrases such as ""big boy pants"" then I'm like dang it ! I did it again
i did it once and then i was like wow that was horrible never again
When I’m around my parents yeah
I do it around my family on my mom's side who i haven't come out to, my teachers and accidentally sometimes
I do that sometime, but it’s because I’m use to pretending to be someone I’m not, but then I realize that I don’t have to pretend to be someone.
It’s ok. We all slip up.
all the time, its a symptom of having to be in cisguise for me
I don’t think there’s anyone who doesn’t do it at least a couple times
Yep. It’s annoying
Yes. Sometimes I have dreams that I’m a dude. (Trans fem here). I’m 4 years into my transition on all the hormones. I think it’s a part of my mind that understands that I lived the first 23 years of my life being treated, called and perceived as a certain gender. I also have dreams that align with my current gender identity. And of course how I feel in my body changes with my hormones. Sooooo all in all - I’m me. That’s it. I love , live and navigate life as me nothing else. I only care about others perceptions when it comes down to safety (I.e restrooms, being stigmatized while in public, etc) even then I’ve learned to hold my own. 

I’m focused on my career and know that it’s something no one can take from me- my sense of self worth . People can be haters all they want- but like who even are they?! Like hold a mirror up to them and they can’t handle. Stay strong.
Honestly I stopped misgendering myself in my head whenever people got used to calling me by my name and pronouns. It just comes naturally who I am now
I always think of myself as a woman but then I look in the mirror and am severely disappointed smh
I misgender myself a lot, I’m an idiot
Rarely
Yes lol
I did it just the other day...
yep. I keep forgetting I'm not a girl but when I'm addressed as one I want to cry
My friend just yelled at me the other night for deadnaming myself.
Sometimes. I mean I’m not hard on myself about it. 30 years as a male vs 8 months as a female, I’d be surprised if I didn’t accidentally misgender myself.
Habitually, over the years of having to lie about myself in the past has that effect. It's gotten better over the years since I came out officially, though unfortunately, it still happens at times.
I did a LOT starting out. Still do occasionally but it’s increasingly rare. It bothered me a lot too until my therapist said one sentence that helped me get over it and be more patient. She said very simply, “You’re not used to saying it out loud.” 😉 Be patient and kind to yourself, even though you’ve felt a certain way your whole life, you have to learn how to actually put your true self into action. It takes practice and everyone does I would wager. Hope this helps. ☺️
Nope, but my OCD tries to.
I once almost accidentally dead named myself
Don’t think I ever really thought of myself as he. That was always just the act I put up to try to fit the role I thought I had to play. In my head it’s always been “you” “I” or “she” depending on what perspective I’m using to look at myself.

Edit: actually now that I think about it I did think of myself as he for a while during early puberty when I was trying super hard to be masculine and was very harsh towards myself bc I was so obviously not masculine. However, when I think of myself as a child I think about how much she was hurting and I wanna go back in time and give her a big hug and tell her everything is gonna be alright and it’s ok that she’s not a the boy everyone thought she was and that she still has me, herself, no matter what.
Yes all the time it takes time to make new habits. I was male with a male name for 32 years, it takes time to unlearn that
It’s a bad habit I have
Misgender yes but i dont even recognize my deadname anymore
Only when I have to..
I often misgender myself when talking about myself in the past, considering I genuinely did use she/her pronouns for 33 years. It’s easy to see myself currently as they/them, but hard to retroactively re-write my pronouns and gender identity. Even if I didn’t necessarily ever identify as cis, I didn’t exactly know better until my late 20s (yay being an older millennial with very little trans awareness! /s).
yes.

obviously.

of course.

*yeah.*
HAHAHA yup!! Especially since I’m just about 4 months out as trans. It’s normal and you’ll eventually be able to gender and name yourself correctly. I still find it weird and awkward when me parents use she/her and my new name as they’ve called me he/him and by my dead name for 17 years. I kinda got used to it so it’s weird. But it’ll change don’t worry
Yeah, all the time. Not as much as I used too though.
all. the. time.
i always feel awkward saying my chosen name and acoid saying it cus it sounds forced, and same with saying my correct pronouns. 
sometimes ill accidentally misgender myself and i feel so dumb haha.
Yeah and sometimes it feels even worse than when other do it ://
Yeah
Yeah, one time my friend said I should ask this guy out and I said, ""but he's gay.""
Yeah, I have a very rich internal monologue that can often be 3rd person. A lot of the time I’ll use she/her pronouns and give myself dysphoria and feel like an imposter.
Yeah sometimes, after the most of those times i am all night being stressed out about if i am just confused and i'm a cis girl and that i am faking.... It's honestly horrible
I do not unless I'm with family I haven't come out to yet
Sometimes. I dream that I'm a cis woman a lot, but I still have some difficulty thinking of myself as a woman in my inner thoughts.
Unfortunately I do
All the time, is normal
Yes
Constantly. I was 21 when I fully discovered I was trans (she/they) and I’ve been so male socialized that I very often misgender myself and I hate it.
It's hard to get used to it though don't be so tough on yourself I refer to myself using my deadname sometimes just know ur not alone
It helps to have a friend constantly correcting you. It’s annoying in a lovely way.
Im getting better at it. Considering i talk to myself very often its been hard to break 25 year habits.
I rarely do, maybe once or twice a month, it sucks and it makes me feel bad for some minutes but it's just because of forcing myself to use he/him pronouns for years despite knowing that I was actually a girl, it's like when a police officer is undercover for so long that they get used to it lmao, don't worry, it happens to most of us when we start transitioning or even after years of doing so, you will slowly stop doing it, you just have to get used to it and get comfortable with your own gender, or maybe even further explore your gender
Turn that frown upside down and turn that disappointment into self-confidence. 

Transitioning socially and physically is one thing, but transitioning mentally from what you knew yourself to be to what you know you are now takes time. 

Mistakes are part of the process💗🌸💗
I'm bad about it when telling stories from the past, like when I was a kid and being seen as a girl back then.
all the time, but it's the best feeling when someone uses it for me consistently
in my head I almost always accidently dead name myself and I can't stop ><
Yes omg. I do that once in a while too, I hate it lol. But what can ya do? I lived as the wrong gender for 30 years, the change to being yourself takes some getting used to.
All the time, I'll use my birth name for myself cause I feel a lil embarrassed for my chosen name but the second someone uses it I get so fucking happy
Absolutely fucking all the time
I have my name pretty figured out but I cannot gender myself correctly for the life of me (other people I can just not me😂)
I honestly felt like the only onr who felt like this too!! When people use my correct pronouns i feel giddy, same with my new name. I just feel like time does everything and we will used to it, we’ve been so used with our old pronouns but I feel like time does everything for us. I feel so happy that I dont feel alone 💜💜
as a enby
I literally look to the mirror and repeat constantly how idiot and unconvicted I am and that I will never be anything but a girl that wants attention (im AFAB)


that's shit but im trying to get over it
So a habit of mine is to talk to myself when I’m nervous. Unfortunately, nervous me doesn’t remember my new name, causing me to talk to my old name.
All the time! It just gets set in your mind no mater who you are.
I do it all the time and I'm a cis gender male
I do it sometimes and then other times I forget I’m trans. It’s normal.
I'm not really ""out"" irl so yeah, all the time.
Yep, never with she but I accidentally use they on myself all the time
Everyday I remain in the closet. So I have misgendered myself, on purpose for 50 years now. . .
My gender is kind of expansive, so internally or when talking to myself, sometimes I do. Sometimes it's also easier referring to myself as female in conversations about like oppression
...no i don't sry
Almost too many times
Not as much any more but I definitely used to.
Yeah. It hurts.
not in a very long time... a year or so
I’ve been out in some spaces for just over a year and that took me probably 6 months to decide to do that, so usually only when referring to the past or if I’m talking about something that happened with someone I’m not out to to people where I am out. There are times when I do it intentionally but that’s in places where I’m not out so I’m not really including that. I still have dreams in which I’m still my agab so don’t beat yourself up too hard.
i do sometimes but it happens more often with my name 😅 i went to put my name on a paper, started to write my old name and was like ""...wait. that's not right-""

it happens, doesn't make you any less valid.
Sometimes I just have to in front of certain ppl and I hate it
Oh yeah all the time! Especially cause I’m not totally out…I also have annoying dreams where I clearly still have the same body I was born with and a big penis when I wish I could dream up my ideal body haha.
All the time and I literally slap my hand over my mouth. I don’t know why I do not miss gender others but I like have to miss gender myself on accident. 😫
Ive done it a few times and it always upsets me.  Getting better at it as I continue to accept myself.
Constantly :/ Imposter syndrome is the worst
I’m a trans guy. I have a younger trans sibling, I married a cis woman, and we adopted a non-binary teenager.  I’ve misgendered the mail carrier at this point.
Hello!  My fiancé is trans and they do misgender themselves a few times here and there.  We have 4 kids so usually it’s to them.  

It’s hard since the kids call her dad or daddy still. But her pronouns are she/her. 

Don’t he hard on yourself.  It’ll take time and a few mess ups along the way
I do it a lot and it's hard to call myself what I actually am around my family. I want to start properly when I find work and move out
I do it all the time honestly
Shit, I just remembered the really distressing dream I had last night... I referred to myself as a girl and I was basically like ""No I'm a girl I'm not actually trans"" in my dream like wtf.  Stupid dream me. I'm a guy.
I’ve started getting better about it but it can be hard, you shouldn’t feel disappointed though, it takes time 💕
Only ten times a day
Lmao yes, I've done it so often accedentally out of habit.
all the time
Sort of. There's a lot of old feelings to convert c:
Yey for mental changes
legally i have to often
i used to when i was early in transition or when i was depressed i purposely misgendered myself
Accidentally yes a good amount of the time but I also get misgendered by my family and their friends all the time cause they are homophobes :’D
For me, my gender is pretty fluid, I gender myself how I feel, but I prefer other people to use they/them because it's more of a neutral term, I sometimes feel weird when other people call me he, but I do it to myself because I feel certain parts of myself as he, but when other people say it, it feels like they don't see me for who I actually am, they only see the he in me, and not the she and they parts, idk tho, I'm weird
Sometimes. It gives me a weird case where I'm not sure who I'm talking about while also talking about myself. Kinda hurts my head a bit.
hang in there sis we got this
Trust me, it gets better over time. You got this! I've managed to get past it, so you will too, I believe in you!!
Sameee. Sometimes I feel silly using my chosen name but it feels AWESOME when someone else uses it
This. So much of this. I still feel guilty using my own correct pronouns. I try to phrase things such a way that pronouns are not involved at all.
Absolutely the same.
For the first time after telling her, my friend naturally used my chosen name in conversation last night, and oml the euphoria was great!
i agree
Same
This...
This is mostly how it happens for me, when I’m thinking about myself and there’s a narration going on in my head about whatever topic, I often still think my deadname and she/her pronouns and I quickly try to correct my thinking because it angers me.
I still do this a lot. I’m only just now getting in the habit of mentally correcting myself.
My parents are still struggling to remember after months now and I often react extremely negatively because it causes an almost 0-10 level of anger just hearing the wrong pronouns or my deadname 😔 I KNOW they’re not doing it on purpose (both parents fully supportive and affirming) and they’ve been calling me a certain name and different pronouns for 27 years and it’s going to take time for the new ones to come naturally…but *goddamn do I ever despise it*. 

I feel terrible that I react so badly (I am autistic and have a disorder called Alexithymia which means I cannot express certain emotions in an appropriate way), but I truly just feel enraged any time I hear the wrong name or pronouns.
Flub is a good word
Luckily I always called myself a man or a boy ""as a joke"". I'd say ""this guy is hungry"" or whatever. So at least that part of my transition has been easy-ish.
So refreshing to read your perspective. I too give people a lot of latitude when they slip up and credit for trying, (Changing habits of thinking takes time.) but when I misgender myself in my own private thoughts, I’m not so generous. Thank you for the reminder that we deserve at least as much grace as others when it comes to this.
Thank you so much for this comment, really made my day and reminded me to be patient with myself. Sometimes it feels like it took so long to find this that I should just Be perfect at it, and this just was such a helpful reminder. Thank you ^.^
oh oof... same
A couple times now, I'll try to give myself a pep talk for something difficult I'm about to do and dead name myself accidentally.  Yeah, that sorta has the opposite effect of what I was going for at that point.  I also end up berating myself for being dumb.
Thank you for putting your hand up. I was also wondering if I was the only one. Especially with regards to the internal monologue.
Can’t a woman (boss bitch) get some peace and quiet around here!?
I've only ever heard people use 'person' in that context, or 'body.'

e.g. What's a body got to do to get \[whatever\] around here?
Yeah that’s what I was thinking about as well. Maybe when you say things like “im the kinda girl that does this or that” or “im a different man now” etc?
But it needed time
Same <\3
It depends on your preference honestly. I correct myself and people when talking about pre-coming out because it makes me uncomfortable.
Also a while back I was at my brother's place and a friend of his came over and I was like ""I'm (brother's name) uh... Brother!""
Sure, but it takes some getting used to for everybody, especially when you've been socialized against your innate nature for years. Progress isn't constant. It will come in fits and starts.
I used to feel absolutely fucking absurd saying my deadname out loud. I hated it so much, and I think that was my first sign of dysphoria lol 

Meanwhile I happily will refer to myself in third person now ""make room for RemRem!""
Omg same
This.
aa same !! i was so lucky to have such an accepting friend ! she automatically started using my preferred pronouns and name and when she messed up she corrects herself so fast
i’m eternally grateful to have her as a friend
I'm the same
Isn’t it nice? It allows some nuance for intention… ‘mistake’ is a word that focuses on the wrong of the thing not the circumstances. ‘Flub’ is something you do unintentionally. Still a ‘mistake’ but one that comes from the mouth working before the brain does… an actor flubs their lines… they are not intending to disrespect the playwright or script writer… they are working with what their mind and mouth can keep up with a juggling act. Sometimes they flub the line… and it’s fine. 

But of course… some people deliberately and specifically say the wrong thing to cause harm… and yeah, to hell with those people. We see so much vitriol every day of peoples reaction to mistakes. For sure, some of them are warranted and deliberate deadnamers should get a dressing down… but others… oh I do worry about the ‘flubs’ that get dragged through the streets.
Saaaame it is so hard to pep yourself up when you feel dumb by doing that
oh right! yeah, I don't really misgender myself after I came out, whenever I talk with someone or thinking because I'd feel very awful if I do that. but if I talk about my past I'd refer to that person as he/him because I don't really recognize that person when I see my old photos. Not sure if that counts as misgendering myself. 

Also, I'd slap myself if I ever said ""I'm a different man now"" to myself.
This. Sooo true. I've known myself one way all my life, switching is hard!
Side note: there’s no such thing as “innate nature”. Social sciences have already proved it, and I as a trans female sociologist confirm it. Please bear in mind that the idea of “gender” is socioculturally constructed and it’s imposed to us during our socialization process based on biophysical characteristics. Yes, we’ve been constantly told that “we were born this way”, especially by Lady Gaga. Though the only thing that’s “natural” about our species is that we are animals and hence drive ourselves based on survival instincts. 

That being said — honestly I can’t simply let these things go hehe —, I hope things become easier for Alice 💜.
yeah same, ever since i was a kid i hated saying my dead name out loud (still do)
I’m so glad I’m not alone. Sometimes I’ll skip pronouns all together. I die a little every time I do that though, because fully constructed and coherent sentences are a huge turn on to me. Ugh
Not having been well-educated in gender studies yet, I'm not sure what the interplay is between the socialization process and the compulsions I have suppressed for two decades that I have denied myself to engage with gender-affirming activities. I would have expected, based on what I know of behavioral conditioning, that the need to present as a woman would eventually have been extinguished, but it never was. This is why it feels like ""she"" has been an innate part of me and why I defined that feeling in that way.
Isn't there a biological aspects to being gay? I thought I heard that there's likely a biological aspect of being trans too, though environmental factors might influence things as well. But if those factors affect you while young, beyond your control, and can't be undone, can't that be called innate nature? It's just who you are?

Sometimes it can be thought of as an inclination towards identification with a sex and their physical characteristics, which aren't socially constructed, no?

I'm just asking what you mean by innate nature when considering these things.

(I'm not saying you need dysmorphia or certain traits to be trans).
I actually found a loop hole. 

I literally will refuse to say it and make my wife do it :)
When I first came out socially and at work, I told a few people they could use she/her or they/them even though I am absolutely a woman. Since my features still present as quite masculin, it was just very awkward asking other to apply female pronouns.  I told myself at the time that I was giving them an out, but I was really giving myself one. Over time I’ve grown more comfortable with others using my correct pronouns, but I rarely use them myself. Like you, I construct phrases that avoid pronouns altogether. You are definitely not alone! ❤️"	r36g9h	trans	1951	0.98	2021-11-27 05:35:34
I (FTM) have to change in the girls' changing room - is there any way I can make sure the girls don't feel uncomfortable with me being there?	"Basically, I am in secondary school and have been openly out as trans (FTM) for around 6 months. I am pre-t but am lucky enough to pass pretty well and am almost never misgendered or mistaken as a girl.

While the school is pretty chill with me being trans, and let me wear the boys' uniform etc. without a problem, my parents are not, and they will not let me change in the boys' changing rooms, get my name changed on the system or in fact do anything where they have a say. This is not a massive issue for me since the girls in my year know I am trans and are comfortable with changing with me when we change for PE, but whenever I go to change for extra-curricular sports (most often to go to the gym after school) and am in the changing room with a bunch of girls from other years who don't know me or know that I am trans, I can't help but feel that I make them hugely uncomfortable and I hate it. They will sometimes ask me what I'm doing here and almost always give me dirty or confused looks, and, of course, this is not their fault - I would probably feel the same way if I were in their situation. 

Unfortunately, the changing room is very open-plan and I am not allowed to change in a bathroom, and, since there is not really anywhere I can go to hide, I more or less have to change in a corner with my head down. This does not really bother me, but I still feel really shitty about invading a space for girls and making everyone uncomfortable.

Is there anything I can do to make the girls feel ok with me being there?"	"OP, if your school is supportive they will let you change where you want and your parents don't have to know. I am a teacher and run the LGBT club at my school and high key do shit all the time without telling parents. It's part of my job. Pretty much none of the students in my club are out to their parents. Our lgbt fieldtrips have vague descriptions so parents don't even know their kid is in the club. I hate to say this but often a major aspect of being lgbt is being selective about what you tell your parents. Sometimes you just have to keep things from them for your own mental wellbeing

When it comes to being trans, get used to doing what you want and not telling your parents (within reason of course). You do not need their permission to be yourself or to do what you need to do to be safe.
tell your parents that you make the girls uncomfortable by being in the girl's room, and tell them to let you change in the boy's one.
Tell the school this is a problem and go to the mens room. 
I dnt think its your parents business where you go change cloths thats qctuly super creepy that they care.
Wait... Why can't you change in the bathroom?
I would say ""I'm sorry, but because my birth certificate was mislabeled my parents and the school refuse to let me use the correct changing rooms. I'd bring it up with the school and maybe the district to see if they can get the code changed so it doesn't require parental permission to use the other changing rooms. I have just as much of a problem with it as you do""
thats just the downside of beeing a Transgender kid to be honest ... if your parents dont allow you anything youre basically fucked.
Just be strong and maybe tell the girls whats going on ... i van understand that ghey would feel IMMENSLY uncomfortable if a guy is changing with them ..
or maybe go change in the toilette or smth :D
I just changed in the bathroom stalls. Maybe that could work? It’s what I used to do when I was in secondary. Sorry if this doesn’t help that much.

(Also, sympathy about your parents, that sucks.)
How do your parents know what changing room you're using? Or is there a teacher there checking everyone at the entrance?

(I only have my school for comparison, where teachers would never know what changing room you used unless students complained or something.)
Have a trans flag near you ! And a pronoun pin ! That way the girls would be less uncomfortable !
When I was in school, I always located the least-trafficked area in the locker room to change. You could do this (if there is such an area) and maybe face the wall so you're not facing the girls in there? That might make them more comfortable -

Also, if your teachers/coaches/etc know you're trans, ask them if there's anything they can do to help you without your parents knowing. They might just make an exception for you to change somewhere else if they understand the situation.

Obviously don't out yourself to anyone you don't want to be out to, though. Just a suggestion. Good luck!
Why are you not allowed to change in a bathroom stall? Seems like a very strange rule
Talk to your school to see if they let you use the staff or disabled toilets. you might have to be open to them about your parents and be open that you think your making people unconfutable hopefully school might understand let you use them.

Only thing I can say is keep your eyes facing the wall and only the wall. any mark can help be it on a bag like pin or badge don't need to be on uniform just on a bag

over all its a school problem and you need chat with the school
You are very tough mentally, and I envy it.
Why the fuck, as a society we allow children to just pile in a room ad get naked together? Yet girls can't wear tank tops.... What the actual fuck is wrong with public schools?
Disobey your parents?
Op you sweet sweet man. Pretty much the whole point is because you are wanting to avoid  the potential upsetting of absolute strangers. 

Truth be told I don’t think a better solution can come then you just explaining the situation to them and if they understand bam solid human.  if they don’t then they probably got raised to believe that from their parents and it’s gonna take time; maybe too much time some kids are just hateful. 

I’d say carry your head high and build up regular dialogue with the people who are usually in there with you. So when new people come in even though you appear different you are just like everyone else a human trying to change. 

People should view it like that more often.
One thing that's pretty valuable is making friends with the school nurse, they usually have a backroom and I'm pretty sure if you talk to them they might let you change there, just gotta be super honest. The school nurse was my homegirl because growing up I had severe stomach issues and pains and she'd let me just hang out in the back until I was good. Worth a shot honestly
To consider:

The school’s official position will always be no, however, if you are caught sneaking into the guys room the gym coach might magically not see you. You are just that sneaky. 

The school could never tell you this avenue was open to subvert your parent’s choice because that would risk lawsuit. But if you came up with it and didn’t tell anyone, you would take the fall if you are too obvious and then be punished by the very people who agree with you, if the coaches choose to see you at all. 

The school could probably come up with some very creative punishments that aren’t actually punishments. A firm talking to each time perhaps.

I won’t endorse this idea I just want to throw it out as something that could be considered.
Can't you just go change in the boy's changing room without asking? 

If your school is fine with you being trans and student wont complain there is no way your parents would ever know.
It's not your problem. It's theirs.
Not sure if it’s an option for you but if your school has stalls in the bathroom your school has you use, you can maybe change in there. MTF and I get dressed in the boys bathroom stalls to avoid being surrounded by a sausage fest. You could also always wait outside your changing room until everyone else is done and quickly change after, you’ll only be a few seconds later than everyone else. Sorry if neither of these are viable but that’s all I’ve done since I don’t like confrontation ;^;
I don’t really get why people feel uncomfortable, it might because of my low emotional intelligence lol
I have an idea..... use the male changing room????
change on the grass as protest
[deleted]
Heya! Also had this problem. If there’s any single toilets perhaps ask to use those? That’s what I did, got a note saying I could use them.
Best choice you have in this is to change in a broom closet or a gender neutral toilets.
Why can’t you use the bathrooms? I’m confused on that part.
I remember having similar-ish problems as an mtf teen in the southern us. Too sexy for the boys to be trusted around us, and rugged to be accepted by the girls. 🤩🥺

Eventually the solution that my teachers decided on was that I would change in the coach’s office while she waited outside. It isn’t ideal, but it worked.
Only real suggestion I have is to wait outside for the girls to finish, and then get changed in privacy. It'll mean you're late, and it's an inconvenience to you, but it does make a quite clear statement dividing you from girls. There are definitely possible problems. It's almost definitely going to be confrontational with teachers who either tell you to get changed and then see you outside waiting; or find you to be constantly late to the next class. It's a fault of the people who force you into this situation, but that doesn't mean they'll rationally understand your stance.

I wish you the best in any case. I hope things change for you, or at the very least, I hope you find a way to get by until you can graduate out of that place.
Is there anyone who works for the school that you're close with? Perhaps you could speak to them about maybe making a space for you to change specifically for the extra curricular sports. It's a small step, but it probably has the best chance at proceeding.
Personally, I was a pretty bold kid and rebelled against stupid rules. If you are feeling bold and brave, try any of the following:

1. Change in the bathroom anyway. Tell no one, do not justify yourself. ""I have to pee. And now I am ready for sports.""

2. Don't change. Get your uniform grimey and make it your parents' problem

3. Change in the hallway. Make everyone uncomfortable!

4. Bring in a room divider and leave it in the changing room. Change behind it

5. Drop out of extracurricular sports that require you to change where your parents have a say. Take up rec sports or a different hobby where public clothing changes are not a thing.

6. Use the boys changing room anyway. Get in trouble. When interrogated by your parents or school administrator, use only ""I am a boy. I use the boys changing room."" No need to explain yourself further.


A bunch of these strategies may be embarrassing to you, but they also embarrass the heck out of your parents. Force them to face that they are the ones making the girls (and their son) uncomfortable, not you. You are not at fault and have nothing to apologize for.
Ask if you can change in the coach's office, its what I did when I was in high school.
Not sure if this would work for you or not, but if you could get a petition to take with you, and get as many girls to sign it saying that you're presence there is making you uncomfortable, then they might not have much of a choice but to let you change elsewhere.
Would it be possible to get the equivalent of a single stall all to yourself?
Does your school possibly have a coaches office or coaches locker room? My school did and they had locks on the door due to the fact it was for adults to change in but I got permission to use it or I could show up late to change after everyone left as long as I was quick and leave early to change before everyone got in the locker room. You would still be using the “correct” lockeroom or coach locker room (according to what your parents think) but not making anyone uncomfortable. You would have to talk to your coach and your administration but it could be something.
My parents don’t want me in the male changing rooms either, the compromise was to use the disabled unisex toilets, it’s a pain in the ass when they’re both in use (there’s only 2) but it’s better then being in the girls changing room (not many girls like me so it would be super awkward) maybe ask to use the disabled bathroom because it’s a lot better then using the girls.
Girls were always chill with me changing with them because they were comfortable knowing I too grew up with bodies like theirs, but they understood the politics of being trans and why I was in their changing room (though your school is supportive but it’s your parents that aren’t, which in my situation is was that both were against it). I think you’ll be just since you already said you’re openly trans. For the others that don’t, just say “I’m trans sorry 🤷🏻‍♂️”. Idk man. Often I just own my transness and don’t take shit or stares from anybody. It’s never my problem when someone is uncomfortable with my transness— it’s theirs.
Are you able to refuse to change at all?
Speak to your coach directly, they might have a equipment room or private office they can let you change in.
I suppose you could take the passive-aggressive approach, and print out something saying 'The only reason why I'm here is because my transphobic parents refuse to accept the fact that I'm a guy, and the school, for some reason, won't let me get changed in the male changing rooms as a result. If you have any complaints on the matter, please contact the school office, and tell them to let me use the male changing rooms, regardless of my parents objecting to it. Honestly, I don't want to be getting changed here either.' or words to that extent, and, whenever you're getting changed, get some blu-tack and stick that on the wall, so the others know who to complain to.

This may sound rather cynical, but chances are they'll be more willing to allow you to use anything but the female changing room if cis people start complaining about you being in the aforementioned changing room.
I used to just go in a stall but no one knew I was Trans back then. Not very helpful information but I extend my sympathy and support<3
Honestly you don’t need your parents’ permission to get changed in the boys’ changing room but if it’s really impossible for you to do so, what about having something indicating you’re trans? Like a bracelet or a keychain in your bag with your uniform that has the trans flag’s colors, so that people will notice right away why you’re there and won’t be so uncomfortable. Personally I would have more trust in knowing something about someone through their actions than their words. Sadly many people could be suspicious of your intentions and lies can slip through one’s mouth very easily, but if they see the trans stuff in advance before you even get to say anything, I am sure they will feel secure and you won’t be questioned as often, which will be good for both sides. But really, this idea is just a secondary one because the best is for you to get changed where you feel like you should be at, and it’s not like your parents need to know, you can ask the school to let you and keep it a secret from your parents. If they are so lgbtqia+ supportive as you described, I am sure they’ll have no problem with that. Trans items do slap though, would definitely walk around with it if I wasn’t closeted and lived in a yet to be supportive country.
First up, so sorry you are in this situation, OP. It sounds as uncomfortable as hell.

If you have allies amongst the girls, could you ask them to back you up? Some others have suggested you talk to the teachers. Likewise if the lads feel sorry for you.
If you live in the US, federal guidelines to the Department of Education require that public schools allow you to use the facilities you want and be called what you want, your parents can’t stop this.

I’m sorry you have that home situation, you deserve far better.
I went to an all girls school catholic school, and while a lot of parents weren’t happy with the idea of me being there, the girls were fine. I myself wasn’t comfortable with it and for the most part the girls just left me alone. The ones who did have a problem with it would either wait till I was out or go in after. But overall 95% did not care. The school should be working with you to find a way for you to be comfortable. I personally threatened to go the education board if they didn’t help. Best of luck :)
After taking everyone else’s advice and you still can’t even change in the bathroom for some reason, work with the school to get a room divider/change curtain in a tiny section of the girl’s changing room so you can go there. 

But I’d tell the school that it could be a legal issue too if one of the girl’s parents complain.
i had this same problem, i usually change in the bathrooms beforehand! hope this helps
i think a lot of people here already gave good answers. i just wanna say, you’re a real gentleman for considering the girl’s feelings in this situation. we need more men like you!
oh god this ~~might be~~ is a ~~bad~~ terrible idea, but are you allowed to wear a packer at school, and if so is there a limit to realism?  XD

>Is there anything I can do to make the girls feel ok with me being there?

Girls don't have to be comfortable with a dude changing with them and that would be the fastest way for state of matter to change.

If girls in the changing room get to raise a problem out of it and protest or involve *their* parents in the matter it's the fastest way for *you* to get more comfortable.
I would just face the locker and change off to the side when I was in softball
They still didn't appreciate me being in there, but it's all I could do 🤷🏻
Could you maybe show up early and change becore the girls get there? Or after they are done and be a few minutes late? If you have an understanding teacher they might help you make that work.

If you don't feel comfortable making a big announcement ""hey, I'm trans, sorry I'm not in the mens room, my parents are jerks"" maybe see if some of the girls can spread the word around for you.
I know my school had showers with curtains and bathroom stalls in the changing rooms for gym. I basically did anything I could to change out of their view and I didn't linger too long . could you ask to change somewhere else? Like go to a nearby restroom or something if the school still says you have to change there?
I would say just change where u want fuck your parent s
i might speak to the school again then and see what happens. thanks!
I could definitely use a teacher like you 5 years ago when I was in highschool.

What a shame that as far as I know, Spain doesn't have anything like this at all
You mean I could have gone to gay class and pretended to study?😱
Thank you for being such an awesome teacher!
Bless you you're a lovely person
I wish my school was like that. We have a lgbt club, some gay teachers, and lgbt safe zones classrooms in school but our club is made up of a few people and slurs are always yelled out in the hallways with little to no punishments. And parents are always informed on everything unless you have great teachers which I am lucky to have.
You are so awesome. I'm a school psych, and I would love for this to be a thing at every high school and middle school.
> we went to a gay neighborhood

I'm sorry, ""gayborhood"".
You sound like a great teacher!!
That is awesome, you are awesome
You remind me a lot of my diversity club teacher back in middle school and thank you for doing that for students
God I wish there was someone like you at my school when I was in high school.
You should do an AMA
I've spoken to them loads but they won't let me. They say I am a ""confused girl"" and even got mad at the school when they suggested I use the boys' changing room.
I was wondering this, too. It seems if the school is advocating for him to use the appropriate dressing room, they'd allow usage of the bathroom. Furthermore, it's disturbing this isn't allowed as a general rule. So many people have physical disabilities/abnormalities that they are self conscious of, and I bet this rules keeps a lot of people from playing sports or participating in whatever might require one to change clothing.
They said the school wants them to use the boys changing room too but his parents won't let him
Could also maybe convince some of the parents of the girls to sue OPs parents over them basically forcing their girls to change with a boy over the protestations of the boy and the school itself.
thanks, im not really allowed to change in the bathroom but at this point idrc i’ll do it anyway
nope there’s always a teacher inside the changing rooms to supervise
The uniform doesn't really allow, it but I think that's a good idea. I might just do it anyway and see what happens! Thanks
yeah i’ll defo speak to them. they all know i’m trans anyway
Haha thanks I haven’t heard that one before :)
thank you! i will try talk to them, but i don’t want to just go up to them like “i’m trans btw” if they haven’t asked. might find a pin badge or smth instead
i think it’s more that the girls that don’t know me don’t actually know i’m trans, so they think i’m just a cis boy in the girls room
Assuming not texas or florida :,(

California they cant do anything to stop me :)
Because it explains the struggle. And even though he’s a boy, he arguably knows a girls body pretty well.
I hope you have some luck,  this makes me glad to have avoided locker rooms after elementary school.  It sounds inappropriate for the school to not at least give you a different way to get ready for things where you'd need relative privacy as the other people in your classes.
It's appalling to me that they won't let you change in a bathroom, at least! Even without being trans, no one should be forced to change in front of people if they're uncomfortable with it.

If they won't let you switch locker rooms, maybe at least push for being allowed to change in a bathroom stall, or something that allows some privacy.
Do you have any friends with human parents who could complain about their kid changing beside a boy? Not sure if that would help you hit it’s a though.
Is there a way you can get permission to change not in a changing room at all (since your parents refuse) and change in a bathroom or friendly teachers room instead? I know it’s not fair bc you deserve to use the accurate (mens) changing room just like everyone else, but it might make you more comfortable
Emphasis on the fact that you feel that you may be making the girls feel uncomfortable as you are a boy in their space.
At the very least, the school could make an allowance for you to change in a bathroom. It’s ridiculous to me that they haven’t made that very easy accommodation.

If you’re having trouble with admin at your school specifically, try to find a teacher or other school employee who will go to bat for you. Admin might be more willing to listen to them.
[deleted]
well, sorry. Is the school required to out you? if not, you can maybe talk with the administrators to let you use the boy's one anyway, and not tell your parents.
They’re confused parents. No airquotes there.
I'm sorry for what you're going through but props to your school for at least attempting. 

I couldn't see any school here even think of suggesting that 
(Florida resident here)
I’d ask the school if you can use it without parent permission. Explain how your parents are transphobic and don’t agree with anything you try to say. Tell the school others are getting uncomfortable
I wanna fight them.
imma speak to them and basically say that if i can’t change with the guys i’m going to change in the bathroom for the sake of the girls
I've seen advice like this a few times in the thread, and I guess I just wonder about one thing.  Seems like that kind of pressure would just influence the school to say ""okay, don't set a policy, but no sports for this particular individual.""

Sadly I don't have better info.
Yeah, good idea.
This is starting to sound a lot like ""you can have a different opinion, as long as it's the same as me"". If they offer you only one choice there is no choice at all. Don't fall for these mental gymnastics and stand up for at least a compromise. Can't dress here and there, then what's the problem with dressing in a private room? Seems like a solution for just about everyone involved. If they're not willing to compromise beware of your personal boundaries. Never ever let anyone force you something you aren't comfortable with.
You have a teacher watching you change? That's kinda creepy.
Just stick a pin badge on your PE bag or something
Trans coloured face mask!
Right I was worried my comment came off potentially sounding like that. Much more along the lines of just acting like you usually do. Never directly addressing it unless asked
Oh boy, that is really not ideal. What a nightmare
I'm 28 and wanna be in your class
Unfortunately, the school can't do anything like that without my parents' permission. I have spoken to them before but they aren't willing to budge since they risk legal action being taken against them.
Confused ""parents""
I'm glad you have the strength to do that! I'd have given up when I was young. I hope it goes well!
I mean, the policy should be ""parents don't get a say"". Children are not possessions, no matter how much some parents opt to treat them that way.
lmao is that not normal??? it’s always a female teacher for the girls room and a male one for the boys room
That sucks :( 
In France our education minister made a “law” which makes the school a safer space and they are not obligated to out us anymore. Teachers have to call us by our name and I’m lucky enough to be able use a changing room which is reserved just for me during my PE hours so no one could see me changing ( I don’t feel ok to change in front of people no matter their gender but particularly boys ). You don’t have this solution I guess ?

Edit : grammar and orthography
well that sucks. Good luck in your transition!
OP where do you live? In my state it is the opposite - it's illegal for schools to out students to parents and illegal for them to deny trans students to use their preferred bathroom. You really should look into the law where you live instead of taking their word for it and reach out to an adult you trust at the school (counselor or teacher). Your school may actually be in violation of the law despite them saying the opposite
If there are no other options, perhaps you can change in the bathroom? Better than nothing
If you do it without notifying the administrators first, who do you think is going to stop you or tell your parents?
thanks :)
I agree.  I do. 

But OP is an actual person in an actual school in the actual world.

""Should be"" is great when we debate new legislation and stuff.

When people's lives are at stake, I think it's valid to consider ""will be"" instead  ¯\\\_(ツ)\_/¯
Not where I am from anyway, but customs vary. Our teachers didn't really come near the student changing rooms unless we were taking waaaaay too long.
whoa, that was definitely not a thing when I was in high school. I think it is pretty messed up to have an adult in the teens' change room yeah.

this world is absolutely nuts. because apparently we can't have basic rights for trans people, but this is considered fine??
No. It is definitely not normal in my books
Not even in early elementary where im from, even tho it would not be as big of a surprise if a teacher came in to get us out after we had been messing around for too long
If something were to happen to him in the boys' bathroom, the school would be liable and you can bet the parents would sue as they went against them.
I hope it all goes well
You got this! 💕🌸The school should accommodate. You have every right to feel comfortable, and you shouldn’t feel like you’re making others feel uncomfortable either.  So sad that this is even an issue in our society 🙃
For sure, which is why I suggested having other parents pressuring the parents directly, rather than pressuring the school.
Pretty sure my elementary school didn't even have any male teachers, so no clue who they would have watch the boys if they did something like that."	ua1dcl	trans	1886	0.93	2022-04-23 09:08:13
I just got misgendered while riding my motorcycle	"So I was riding my motorcycle when some guy went through a red light. I used my horn because ???? There are children walking and cycling everywhere.
A few moment later he stands next to be at a red light and is like ‘you’re a woman aren’t you?’ ‘Yeah because you can’t ride and women shouldn’t be riding those things.’

I really thought I passed while riding my motorcycle. My girlfriend says I look very masc and confident and other friends told me they thought I was a cis hetero male. 

It’s really demotivating to be misgendered by a complete stranger in a disrespectful way.
:("	"That sounds less like malicious misgendering, and more like a toxic masculinity mindset if ""If you're gonna give a shit, then you must not be a man""

Still sucks, and in the end you felt like shit for it, and it is still toxic. I'm sorry this happened.
""you can't ride"" said by the guy who ran a red light. XD None of his opinions should hold any weight in your head.
Idk that's sounds more like a ""if you knit you're not a man you're a woman"" kinda thing like misgendering cis men just to reinstated toxic masculinity
He was just trying to reinforce his own masculinity and machismo, & stroke his giant ego. He thought you were a man, and wanted to bully you and make you feel like crap to make himself look better. That what asshats like him do. He's not intuitive enough to know that that you're trans.
It's actually an indirect & unintended compliment about how well you present. He saw you as he would any other cis male.

Turn the encounter around, and take the Win! 🥳
You don’t know how to ride. Says the one that ran a red light with people around. I’m a car enthusiast so i understand these types.
Well that's the best an a$$hat can do. Don't even let the ignorance make you flinch.
Yeah honestly I thought I was getting crap from guys about wearing floral shirts because I didn’t pass but no it was because men don’t wear flowers
Well if it is any consilation. He might not have misgendered you as much as him just insulting you by calling another dude a woman (because being a woman is apparently still a insult to some man).

Edit.) I'm just now seeing almost everyelse is already saying this so i'll add that as much as this might be the case, your concerns and feelings about this situation are still valid. And next time don't be the better person but the best person by offering the passanger a safer ride to were they need to be. XD
He's not only midgendering but also being quite sexist. How incredibly rude of him
FUCK THAT DUDE!
>you’re a woman aren’t you?’ ‘Yeah because you can’t ride and women shouldn’t be riding those things.’

Pretty big words coming from the guy who went through a red light minutes ago. Lmao.
lol bro aggressive drivers will flip you off -as- they cut you off, this sounds like the kind of guy that will brake check you in a snowstorm cuz you arent going 80mph.
[deleted]
As a Cis guy, I can tell you this wasn't about how you passed. This was an insecure boy trying to bring down the much cooler guy riding a bike. You passed so hard he went for a school yard taunt. Well done.
you know, he might be doing that as a toxically masculine way to assert dominance and hurt the pride of who he assumes (correctly) is another man?
You don't need to take that from an entitled cage jerry. Guy has no regard for anyone's lives but his own.
this is really just toxic masculinity at its finest 🙄
Dude just checked your profile and you pass like this guy was just being sexist
He was just targeting whatever he could use quickly. It could have been skin color, physical build, anything.  When people are out of control angry they usually go for the fast strike. He went after that. Ignore that fool.
Fuck that guy
Not only is that misgendering, that also feels like misogyny
I don't know what you look like but it's very likely he called you ""a woman"" as an insult for ""not knowing how to ride motorcycles"" rather than for looking like one.
Sounds like he would have said this or something similar to any other non-macho
It’s alright bro
Hey buddy here’s what I’ve learned. I have a hard time growing a beard, so I feel like I still don’t pass well. Just keep your confidence up and F what anyone else has to say. You are masculine and you are perfect. All there is to it
Before I came out mtf I rode a motorcycle. Being called a woman was super common, lowest bar attempt at an insult guys threw for all sorts of things. For sports, vehicles, movies, music, it’s rarely logically relavent. they’re just a bully you made feel out of control. I doubt he knew. I’m sorry he harassed you bro, that shit hurts.
Wow, transphobia and misogyny (not that it applies to you) at the same time. Do not let his opinions mean anything to you.
Yeah you probably looked like a man to him too, I don't think he intentionally misgendered you because you are trans, he rather did it because he saw you as another guy. he just called you a woman because sexism and ""women can't drive"" and trying to hurt your masculinity. Don't let him get to you, he's just a sexist prick who thinks woman is a general insult
Someone who can't follow the rules of the road shouldn't be the one saying anyone can't drive. Let the one without sin cast the first stone.

You're not at fault here hun, don't let his ignorance get to you.
Hey, I bet most men aren't masculine enough for him. I learned the other day from some guy that apparently wet wipes are too feminine for some super masculine men and they won't even be seen using them under any circumstances.?? because it's shameful for some reason..? Your never going to please people like those and you shouldn't bother. You should trust your friends on this one.
Tbh sounds like he's just doing the regular toxic masculinity misgendering thing that some wankers do to other cis men like ""you can't kick balls for shit you fucking girl"" or whatever, especially if he was an older guy, I don't think it had anything to do with your appearance, but obviously it hurts to hear that, sorry dude. You did the right thing too.
My friends are annoyingly Trans Inclusionary misogynistic, lol... ""make me a sandwich"" ect, lol
Sorry to hear this
Own your power. They are long gone, like most cis het bros. Byeeeee
Clearly dude’s never heard of The Litas before. Women just ride better
Ugh I feel you... I was starting to gain confidence, and everyone around me says I pass really well. Yet I was walking home past some people and I heard them say ""wait that's a dude"" followed by gagging noises >_> 


These things suck and can be such a blow to your self confidence.....
They didn’t misgender you. They mocked you by calling you a woman. It just so happens that you’re trans.
Sounds like the douche didn’t like being called out for running a red light with kids nearby
First off, that guy was a dick. You can’t rely on a partner or friends to say whether you pass or not. They’ll just tell you what you want to hear to be supportive
Honestly, little insecure men will do this to other men to boast their masculinity. It Very well could have been that he was threatened by you and did what he could to bolster his ego. Especially true when the man in your shoes is confident and calm, agro men get reeeeeeeaaaaal butt hurt when another man is more collected than them lol.
Don't worry about that. I might have had a run in with the same guy. Some rando just came up to me and asked ""your a woman right? You need to watch your fucking mirrors."" And it was said to me with a decently long (4-5 inches) brown beard, coveralls and in the driver seat of an 18 wheeler. They just say that shit just to piss you off. It's like calling some other guy ""mary"". More than likely called you that thinking you would get irrationally angry so you punch them, get the police called and sue. Good on you for keeping your head. Let the road rager rage. Maybe their aneurysm will blow soon and you'll never have to worry about them again.
I just saw your two posts on my timeline right next to each other, you look fine man.
You are every bit the man that I am. Forget that schlub.
Second the toxic masculinity point from a mysogynistic jerk.

 I take it with gear on he likely may not have seen gender but he likely would have said that due to fragile/toxic masculinity. He a reckless idiot and anything he says likely would be bs anyway. 

Regardless misgendering really sucks, you're a guy and valid. Sincerely a girl on a CBR 600
I don’t think you were being clocked. I think he was basically taking the long way round to just calling you a “pussy”. Classic toxic masculinity move.
its got nothing to do with gender, and everything to do with just him assuming all women suck at riding.  
I ride, and i ride an R1, im cis woman, but men dont like women who can race and beat them (i race track), and i get called trans or male and everything else under the sun - its just assholes.
It was likely just another shit version of “you play like a girl”. He may have not thought you were a woman at all and was just being an asshole. Meant as an insult, even though it’s not. I could be wrong. But when insecure people get called out on their mistakes, they often try and exaggerate flaws they find in others. And since motorcycle dudes can stereotypically be these buff beer drinkers with 4 foot long beards, he may have been awfully trying to offend your masculinity. Even if he wasn’t. Insecure as hell. Next time, tell him that runners really shouldn’t be driving cars, they’re awful drivers. Including people who run red lights.

Apologies to people running track. I’m sure you’re wonderful drivers.
""you can't ride"" yet he's the one who ran a red light, could've caused an accident, gotten himself harmed/killed, and then proceeds to mis gender you? sounds to me like you someone has a low ego 🤔
just funny to me idk
toxic masculinity is truly upsetting
What bike do you ride?
its so bad that we have people like this in the world!
You have to realize he strawman-ed you. He knew his actions were indefensible, so he went for the personal attack to make you uncomfortable.
Yeah, beeping the horn is not considered masculine by that type. Too passive.   Screaming obscenities and shaking a fist would havd been.  Alternatively, ignoring the guy when you are trying to pass is probably better.  A guy on a bike who doesn't give a shit would have gotten his respect.  

Alternatively, you could kero being yourself, and don't worry about his type.
Do deadlifts, it will build the back muscle and reduce the femme curve.

he could've thought you were a cis man, but was being misogynistic called you a woman cause you were apparently bad at riding you're motorcycle. (Also you drive a motorcycle? Cool!)
Maybe he thought you were a woman but wasn't certain. If so, that doesn't mean you didn't pass.
Yeah, he was a bit.. weird. Weirdest thing is when he screamed these things to me he had a passenger next to him, like ???
[removed]
i guess i’ll knit then
Exactly. If he thought you were a woman he would've opened with that and then said something degrading about women in general. Instead, he took your supposed skill at riding a motorcycle and decided, based on that, that you weren't a man. Both extremely toxic behaviours, but very different.
Very interesting indeed, running a red light really shows how great of a driver he is!
Come to Hawaii. I wear a shirt to work all the time with a unicorn on a rainbow background that says “perfectly straight” on it and it still took some of the dudes I work with 3 months to figure out I was queer, and they still aren’t sure. Hell they still don’t know I’m trans even though I casually mention it in conversation as appropriate. Floral wouldn’t even register.
Thank you so much! I really appreciate you taking the time and energy to write this. I was letting my head down with transphobic ans hateful comments under this post. They do more to you than positive comments.
:) thank you
This is why I wear a pink helmet with cat ears. Don’t want anyone getting the wrong idea.
also looked at your profile, and other post - yeah hell yeah, you pass af on a bike :D
I think it's more of an ad-hominem, if we're being pedantic
ik zeg je eerlijk ik ga toch liever voor appelpeersap van flevosap
I'm not sure what you mean. Could you elaborate?
Do you need attention? I see you’ve got a new account just to comment hate speech on r/trans.
If you want some attention just tell me man ;)
Why is supporting the op in this worthy of downvotes and a hatespeech violation...please elaborate?
Thank you my dear! What are you doing on r/trans if you’re clearly not supportive of trans ppl?
I do?
Toxic masculinity is a hell of a drug, makes people honestly to god crazy
Guess who is probably no longer a passenger.
I'll give you one chance to explain what you mean.
Misogynist: ""You’re not a man if you do girly things""

Trans woman does girly things.

Misogynist: ""No wait, not like that!""
yes he must really think that! you’re okay man, don’t worry about that!
Yeah, he won't be a problem for people for long with those riding skills... I feel more sorry for his passengers cuz that MF is gonna get someone killed.
Yes very true…
Don't listen to him he's just a troll dude literally created is account to shit on us...

i feel like every trans person needs that one slightly aggressive friend that corrects anyone who misgendered them	i have one at work and one in my friend group and i love them both dearly.	"I kinda married one a few years before I came out.
Lol yup my wife. She ain’t having that from family, or friends, or strangers lol. She don’t care, she’s my protector
i need one so bad
Im that person at school for other people, but not for myself. I correct people about other people's pronouns but not for when they misgender me...
So this obviously shouldn't be the norm, because outing folks ain't cool. However, in this situation, I loved it. I've been so shy about using name/pronouns publicly. My friend and I went to the salon together and she was constantly referring to me as she, correcting nail techs. At one point she called my name out from across the busy salon. And, frankly I loved it. It was the push I needed. No one was unkind, in fact it made other women want to chat with me and offer advice on colors or styles. My fears evaporated.
The loving parental figure friend is to die for <3
Literally my parents, lmao. Just hope my Dad isn't around if you do it maliciously, tho. He'll give you a nice can of regret. :)
I wish I had that. I want that so bad I’m so scared to correct anyone… it gives me a lot of anxiety and awkwardness
I'm so glad you do. The first time I misgendered a friend, damn'd how I'd have wished someone would have corrected me in the moment, even if they'd had been slightly aggressive.

I'd just met the specific trans friend a few days earlier, and it was an honest mistake I didn't catch myself. My brain and tongue was on autopilot. No malice, no intent, just autopilot and lack of any practice self-policiing. Then it happened a second time another night. 

Now I like to think I'm the ""slightly aggressive friend"" for others. 

But that one mentioned above? I fear I've lost their trust permanently.

So those slightly aggressive friends...they are not only helping the misgendered individual. Sometimes they're throwing a bone to the person speaking who just didn't realize they stepped in it.

Very glad you've those two friends.
I so need one.
Gender patrol
Wait can you teach me how to get friends?
I would have had one if it wasn't for me 

I congrats to anyone who has one.
I knowww I love them ❤
Word!
My siblings ♥️
I have one but she doesnt always correct people
I'm that aggressive friend for my trans friends, but I require an aggressive friend of my own.
yuppp I got two. my prof. once called me ""she"" and it went like

""He's not a she""
""Okay, get back to work""
""No, apologize to him, you just called him a she""
""[nervous glancing] Okay, okay, I understand, turn around and start working on ______""
[basically the two of them angrily telling him to apologize]

it just went on like that until he told us he would ""write us up"" for not working and ""distracting others"" (we were both done with our work, we were talking about anime or something) and so we just stopped because I don't have the energy for him
Yep. I keep telling myself that I'm going to correct people when I'm gaming but I never do
My good friend/person I’m incredibly attracted to, who coincidentally shares my name
I'm that friend for all my out trans friends, lol (not out myself yet, but hopefully I'll be able to be as assertive with myself too)
I have found if you do this for yourself you just get told you're the issue by the misgenderer; would be cool to have a cool friend like that
oop thats my friend! and im that friend for him, we do it for each other to save the awkwardness
I haven’t been able to play with them cause my Xbox broke so we don’t talk nearly as much as we used to (upwards of 16 hours every day) but we still talk atleast every other day
I have surrounded myself with other women that will throw hands. I’m 6 ft tall and pretty big; if someone was mean to me i’d probably cry. the squad is ready to throw down 😂😂
Yeah :( I'm such a pushover and don't want to rock the boat when people misgender me. Which further feeds into dysphoria when they keep doing it.
Yes!! I have a friend who I also work with and when I came out to her she said just to give her any names of asses that needed kicking and she would take care of the rest!
""slightly""
Yes please.
YES. Luckily, I have some.
had a yearmate in school who got violent over this, otherwise i'm my own slightly aggressive friend lol

unless it comes to family, i'm tired of their whining so i'm just gonna let them fall into the grave they're digging themselves
I am that person lol Even when it's not safe to actively correct someone, I still glare at the offender and you can see in my posture that I'm not pleased.

I'm just sadly not great at doing it for myself
Yes please. I don't have the confidence or esteem to do it myself so I need help
my sister does this i love her
This is me.
oh god, yep i got that friend, at school when we walk in the teacher at in the hall was like ""good morning ladies"" (im ftm but my hair is long, cutting it soon, it's a long story of why it's long but whatever) and my friend just goes up to her and says ""they use they/he pronouns asshole"" but we ran off before we could get in trouble lmao
before my egg cracked i was that friend

& i was fully prepared to carry an air horn
I want to be this for myself, I really do. Every time, I tell myself, ""Next time,"" but then next time comes and I just shrivel up rather than say anything.
I had a friend like that. I've been telling everyone I'm ok with they/them because I feel so shitty about being misgendered and they saw through it and were just like ""nope your a woman and I see u like that"" 
made me so happy 🥰
My jeans get a little wet when someone uses the correct pronouns the first time
I haven't found the right partners yet. She/her/they/them
Polyamorous here.😉 What's up reddit?
i needed* because no one misgenders me anymore
Honestly, that’s my little sister. If only she were around more often 🥲
I only changed my pronouns bc my friend cornered me and was like


""Do you actually *want* to change your pronouns?""


And I was like ""Yes...""


And they were like ""Why don't you?""


And I was like ""I can't ask people that 😭.""


So then they went to our friend group like ""Yo, FraidyDog's pronouns are they/them now mmmmkay?""


And that's how I go the correct pronouns. Now if only I could bring that friend into work to tell off all my coworkers who know I'm trans but still misgender me bc I can't bring myself to ask for the right pronouns 😭
Imagine having a whole squad with that personality
I love those friends, shoutout to them
I mean, ideally, nobody would be misgendered anyway obviously but otherwise I'd agree.
i officially volunteer i have done it without knowing the young lady and the frat boizs were mistreating and misgendering i felt great to make them stop and apologize. granted i wil admit i wanted to do it.
I finally have one lmao
Yes, please.  Please?  Thank you!
 ""Giggle* I'm driving to said friend right now
My girlfriend!!
Feeling like Im slowly becoming that person after being so done with everything
I do it for my DnD characters but not when someone actually misgenders me xD
My gf :)
To the person i know irl that always passive aggressively corrects people when they misgender and deadname me. Praise.
I do that for my girlfriend, she's too nice to confront people on it. I'm not aggressive, I'll just calmly say ""she"" and wait for the correction. It's usually not malicious so confrontation rarely happens
I got one, and am one lol
My wife is this for me. Except she is a little more then slightly aggressive. She is helping me right a coming out letter to my parents and was just like if they aren't supportive I will take you out to the car and give them a peace of my mind before taking you home.
Man I need that but for misgendering myself
I am lucky to have that kind of friend. They will LOUDLY cough and Ben like “cough cough HIM cough MISTER cough. Whew sorry about that.” 

It’s the best! ^^
What friends?
My brother does this and my dad gets so exasperated every time hes corrected (not transphobic just trying his best and failing often)
Lol
I need any caring friend, period. 😔
I have no friends at all
I wish I had one friend
As someone who gets misgendered on a daily basis EVEN WHEN I introduce my name as Samuel, I relate. I have such bad anxiety because the few times I've stood up and corrected someone, I've gotten mocked or made fun of. I'm such an anxious person so I usually just keep to myself... Where is my person ;-;
damn i need one for home
Lol agree I hate doing it
Yeah. I haz, but I don’t get to go out with them enough for it to really come into play. I will smack a bitch who misgenders my trans friend, but I am very non-confrontational when it comes to defending myself 😢
I cant wait for my hypothetical friend to come out because it pains me personally to hear this hypothetical friend get misgendered
Same lol
i looove that for you!
Mine too. Here’s to picking the right life partner!!
i can’t do it for myself but you bet your ass i’ll call someone out for you! what pronouns do you use??
i’m the same way. but i’m sure people are thankful for you!!
i was literally about to comment this. in my friend group almost everyone is on the trans spectrum and we have one cis-het man, at the start of the year he would consistently misgender everyone, like he wouldn't even try, until, I came along. i started kicking him in the shin (not hard but hard enough) every time until he got it right
Hi, I'm your internet Auntie now. 

Willing to throw down with anyone who can't get they/them through for you. Same with dead naming. 

If my 74 year old raised hard-core conservative religious dad can get pronouns correct and avoid dead naming while raising us siblings to do the same FOR EVERY PERSON no matter what so can everyone else. 

I'm sick of people willfully misgendering, deadnaming, and just out right showing hate and disrespect for my loved ones. 

My loved ones include all of you loves reading this. I'm all of yalls Auntie/sis/mum/Nan now. Free hugs and love for life no strings other than being a good human.
totally not supporting outing people, but it’s definitely nice when you need a push or are just anxious about correcting people like i am
that’s awesome!!
This warms my heart.
i’m your friend now. boom. done.
i gotchu!!
same!!
i need love story updates until the end of time
it can be hard, but i’m proud of you! come out when you’re ready - until then, you’re still completely valid!!
i always say until they choose to be supportive they’re not allowed on my island and they can fucking drown
lol, congrats?
she/her
love this approach. imma start doing this
Not a very good friend, tbh
thank you!!
Absolutely! I know your post wasn't suggesting it, but at least for me it worked in my favor. I think if it had gone badly I'd be singing a different tune. Honestly though, it's nice to have supportive friends, because I am awful at advocating for myself!
They’re getting married :) as much as I love them, and they ARE poly which means I can express that love physically, their heart is for another. And the bounds of their polyamory mean that they can only love me as a friend. My heart will bleed and wither until the day I can get over them, but I’m okay with it. It’s something I can accept, because I want them to be happy. I hope my bittersweet reality doesn’t make you sad, at least don’t feel sad for me
relatable, only they're not gonna be allowed om my island even after they become supportitive. It's been three years, the concept of them being proper parents is so foreign to me at this point that it's repulsing
if i ever encounter you in public or on here i’ll fight a bitch! you’re doing great, girl!
fair enough. i hope the best for you tho

TikTok bans misgendering, deadnaming from its content		"How will they even enforce this lol like I’m really glad we’re getting support but how will they actually make this work
Based daddy BigTech?  (Don't worry, I hate this comment too)
That's nice! Hopefully YouTube will do this too (and other platforms)
Big step in the right direction.
They probably won't enforce it much
wait so there was a time when it was just fine to do that?
tiktok of all sites? am I hallucinating?
muh fredumb of speech!

(not understanding that the US Constitution prohibits the gov't from stopping speech, not private businesses)
LET'S FUCKIN GOOOOOO i blew up on tiktok for being a trans woman who skateboards but i deleted my account cause i couldn't take the hate
Based TikTok????
They’ve been using it to take down videos that are CALLING OUT transphobia. Silencing trans people. Tiktok moment :(
Yay! \^\^
Thanks tik tok 😊, but I’m still not downloading the app lol
“””bans”””
I've been reporting shit like this for the past year and it's always been, ""no violation found."" Wonder if it will change anything.
TikTok will use this as a way to ban trans people from talking about trans issues in any clarity because any clarity will be mass reported and we already know the moderators of TikTok here are heavily Christian biased by how many hateful things they let stay while how many things like mental health and trans issues get ripped down and banned.
Cool ban more transphobic content though…
I'm glad that we're getting support from TikTok, but I'm genuinely so confused. How are they going to enforce this? Are they going to rely on people reporting videos? I would like to hear how lol
How?
It's funny I say something to give us support I go to Facebook jail I end up ,. Insta,,spam jail... And get my commenting blocked because these social media platform doesn't want you to protect your best interest , they just wana look good to the pubic
what a fucking joke
Doesn't change that it's Chinese spyware.
As redditors, by law we have to have tik tok, however, this is pleasant news
Now it's time to see if they take it as strict as copyright infringements or actually care for the rule
don’t be fooled, this isn’t going to help trans people. trans accounts are getting banned for talking about transphobia. they’re going to use this to harm trans people even more.
Tragic: worst social media outlet you know meaningfully supports trans people
I think we should create our own social media then. Like seriously one for the LGBTQ+ community where we can have our space to discuss ideas and topics without being harassed. If they don’t want us on their websites like TikTok, twitter, Reddit, Facebook etc then we should do our own thing app and all!
i saw something about this this morning. 

when i went on to TT, the first post i saw was a trans woman i follow talking about how she’s gotten banned for debating transphobes who comment on her stuff. 

TT citing these new  anti-transphobia guidelines as the reason for banning her. 

they’re just gonna use it to further silence trans folks.
Good.
... which would be wonderful if they weren't already using it to silence trans voices. What a fucking mess
I have already seen people complaining about this.
GOOD
My assumption is that it will rely on people reporting videos or comments like their anti-harrasment policy. With that being said their reporting system is garbage and they seem to have no standard. It seems to entirely depend on who is looking at your report.
Probably just user flagging. Manual moderation is a hard problem. Look up stories about YouTube moderation team. Even if they dare to use machine learning to implement this it’s going to be even worse.
It'll be an option within reporting ✌️ this is such a wonderful move on TikToks part. One of the only companies to really come forward to defend our community ❤💙
Violators will receive -9000 points on their social credit scores.

Also bigots totally won’t abuse the reporting system to the point of inoperability.
They have people monitoring videos all day and have a list of what they need to review and flag etc. It isn't perfect but I'm assuming this is mostly what this policy is being enforced by.  Source i know a few people who do this
As long as we all hate it, it’s fine.
Broken-clock corporate politics in full swing. Good to know it’s financially profitable to protect trans kids…probably because they’re the one’s making all of tik tok’s content.
Seriously, how does a Chinese-owned social media (China is not an LGBTQ-friendly place at all) get this right yet all these other places give zero fucks about transphobia?
I'll believe it when I see it. Actions are louder than words.
yah
they don't
I mean most other socials allow it, doesn’t make it ok but from what I know this is the first time any social media that most ppl use has done something like this
Yes, look on any trans content creator, the comments will be filled with misgendering
It wasn’t fine to do it, it just wasn’t completely punishable from my understanding
Well, it wasn't explicitly banned, so it's implicitly allowed.
You say that as if TikTok wouldn’t be the one site to do it and all the boomers will be in uproar because “of course it’s TikTok”

TikTok is the one site I expected this off lmao
Tiktok isn't a US-based company
You should keep your account deleted. TikTok is a cancer that only exists to steal your data
I would imagine an LGBTQ space would almost immediately be invaded by homophobes
There’s lgbt+ mastodon instances if that counts
I've reported maybe 50 comments in total and not a single one has been removed. The moderation on there (and on social media in general) is terrible.
Yeah tiktok allowed a video of a girl being beheaded to stay on the platform for a hot minute and they allow a lot of really triggering content on it as well, as much as I wish it would work it probably won’t work right
It's the same thing here on reddit. They are wildly inconsistent in their dealing with reports.
Also, it's Chinese spyware, so why would they deal with reports?
So basically it's Chinese Twitter, like always.
>Also bigots totally won’t abuse the reporting system to the point of inoperability.

I mean, figuring out who to trust with reports on social media has been a problem very rich companies have had for over a decade. I wouldn't be surprised if there's multiple PhD papers on the subject, how to figure out who to trust from a data science perspective.

For something like this, if it were me and I wanted to duct tape it together, I'd just filter on all users who view LGBT content and give them a high trust rating specifically for misgendering reports, drop the trust on anyone who watches conservative shit that is deemed at all transphobic, and then let the system run and when other users agree with who the high trusted users report, bump their trust. Other users act like how the low trust users report, drop their trust. Eventually you know who is actually worthy of trusting for misgendering reports.

I mean, they have SO MUCH FUCKING DATA on every user. They know who they are, what they like, what they don't, who they'll fucking vote for, whether they're gay or trans or queer. Figuring out who's going to be trustworthy with reporting misgendering is probably simple as fuck with that data. They have no obligation to make reporting fair. They just need to make it work.

Companies like them and reddit know their users better than they know themselves. Their business is generating data for advertisers, not hosting videos. They've perfected this. They don't just know what subs I've subscribed to, they probably know exactly how much time I spent looking at this one submission, how long I spent typing this comment, etc.
I doubt tiktok would be a thing without young queer folk, so yeah, that is probably just how they nurture their profit base.
Its more pandering rather than anything tiktok has a vocal lgbt side, this is just like haha look guys we are pro lgbt
social medias weird
that is bad
interesting
That's irrelevant, though.  Any company (US based or not) can ban any speech on any platform they own.

What I was referencing is that there will be a lot of people claiming this is a violation of free speech.  It's not, regardless of whether the company in question (Tik-Tok) is US based or not.
gotcha, didn't plan on going back with an unacceptable community like that anyway lol
Not if we do it right. We can and should come
Up with a verification process. You know like maybe a picture of you at pride or with a spouse. We can figure this out, where there is a will there is a way.☺️
So I never heard of this site before but I just looked into it. It’s not necessarily a LGBTQIA+ site it just so happens that a lot of the community has gone there and made it their own. That’s not what I want, I want a completely centralized website that caters to the LGBTQIA+ community. something that caters to our communities needs. With that we can have a completely safe environment for our people.
Agreed. I've reported comments that very blatantly broke ToS and nothing.
That's sad, every comment on my videos I have reported and had action taken...I made a video about how depressed I was and someone commented multiple times that I should just end it :(((((
I have gotten one banned! If enough people do report the squeaky wheel will get oiled! If during a live 13 people report someone it will cause a wake if 69 people report it will cause a wave, if 96 people report someone is getting soaked! If it is a huge live and 300 people report that is a tidal wave the support crew is not going to like so ship will hit the fan!

Don't sit there and take it, be loud stay proud, and stand up for yourself, I had a wave of not so nice, after I reported several somehow I got the algorithm to remove quite a few bigots from interacting not sure exactly how it worked out, but I am not complaining!
I think it just depends on which moderator you get.  If it’s a pro-trans one, they’ll act, if it’s a transphobic person, they won’t.
Didn't a huge investigation into tiktok in 2020 show this wasn't the case?
Yes but the point was also that even if it was a government site, outside of the US they can do what they want generally. 

People often forget that there is a whole world outside of the USA…
Well mastodon isn’t a website so I’m not sure where you went haha

There are lgbt+ instances like https://tech.lgbt
Even on here, I’ve reported several comments that contained hateful slurs, and nothing. TikTok seems to be better about actually creating a safe space but I don’t particularly hold out hope.
I thought the results were that that was the case, I don't trust it regardless.
>there is a whole world outside of the USA…

No there's not.  It's all the US.................
I read an article on it, the article made it sound like it was a website. Guess that’s what I get for reading stuff off the internet. I think my point still stands though and even more sense the mastodon thing wasn’t what I thought it was or read.😂
Idk I just remember Trump being upset about the app and having it thoroughly investigated but they didn't shut it down because they didn't find anything. That was 2 years ago though so I might not remember it perfectly.

Got deadnamed in front of all my coworkers by the new night manager. I was talked down to like a child and was treated like I was overreacting for being upset.	"So I work at Wal-Mart and I'm stealth FTM, I've been on testosterone for almost 2 years, I don't get misgendered and no one knows I'm trans and i prefer to keep it that way for safety reasons. Well, last night I went in to work and during roll call everyone got called leaving me unmentioned and my deadname that no one heard before. You can probably guess they'd put two and two together.
   I had a terrible panic attack, my managers know that is my dead name and my preferred name is on everything. This night manager knows my preferred name and insisted on repeating my deadname while I stayed completely silent and frozen. 
   I expressed my anger and why that was dangerous and wrong and he scolded me like a child saying ""how was I supposed to know?"" And playing it off and had the nerve to tell me ""hey, don't use that language with me okay?"" And when I was too upset to ask he repreated himself wanting a verbal ""Yes"" from me. 
   I don't want to go back to work, I feel absolutely humiliated.
   To make matters worse this guy knows I'm autistic and makes it his goal to trigger me. I have no one to go to and no one cares. 
   I'm done.

EDIT: I wanted to day thank you for all the advice. To be honest I fully expected this post to go unnoticed so I'm really surprised and thankful for the support. I'm going to just start looking for a new job to be honest. I'm not good with confrontation and I'm too emotionally exhausted with other factors to make a big stink about it.
Adding to that I'm homeless and can't exactly get a lawyer or anything to sue like some suggested. I think I'm just going to look for new employment, bide my time at walmart until I get the new job, and continue the good fight. Thank you"	"Ok if you have to keep the job, there’s a couple things you should do

1. Take notes. Diligently. Dates/shifts and exactly what happened and what your manager said
2. Go to a higher up, store manager, district manager, as high as you have to go. 
3. Be clear when you go to the higher up that this person is discriminating against you and that you will keep going higher up until someone takes action.
4. Request to never be placed on the same shift as this manager.
5. Look for a local civil rights group and get some Allies that can help you legally protect yourself

Sorry you’re going through this and I hope you can resolve this

Sending ❤️ your way
Former Walmart employee here. Open door policy that shit immediately. There should be a number posted in the break room if you don't trust your gm. I'm so sorry that happened to you. What that manager did was unacceptable and they should be held accountable. Walmart, fortunately, has policies in place to help you in situations like this. Please use them. 
All the love ~ Zara
I also work at Walmart and you can open door that. A situation like that sucks and there is NO reason why a team lead or member of management should be treating you like that after their mistake. I've been working here for 3 years but have only been out for the last 6 months and I literally just had my store manager deadname me the day of our first Black Friday event and he didn't realize it immediately. Then about 5 minutes later he gave me a pat on the shoulder and apologized profusely for it. This goes for all members of management if they deadname me or get my pronouns wrong (doesn't happen often) they admit their mistake and we move on.
In this economy, finding a new job should be easy for him, so if there were any witnesses, I’d sue for discrimination if it’s persistent.
Never respond to someone who calls you by your deadname. Just completely ignore it, act like you have no idea who that is. Dont give in!
Listen, everyone else already gave you baller advice so I just want you to know your anger is 100% valid. We get gaslit all the time as trans men and women and when we get upset, we get made to feel like we’re the unreasonable ones. Absolutely forget that crap. I hope this manager gets in trouble for this and I hope you and your child do okay this winter. Love to you both 💖
Fuck Walmart. Try to find a new job. Don’t even give them a notice.
r/antiwork might be a good place to go for legal advice if you want to take that route, but people in this thread are giving pretty good advice that i encourage you to take, especially taking notes up to someone that manages him. you do not deserve to be treated this way, im sorry that this happened to you
i’ll really sorry this happened to you. wishing you gxdspeed as you power through the winter. i come from walmart country, lots of us have worked for that monster. do what you need to do and protect yourself at all costs 💝
Aww man, I can’t even imagine. As someone who is autistic also, I don’t even understand why ppl do stuff like that intentionally. So sorry you had to go through that.
I believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/qw4q8f/did_you_know_trans_people_have_workplace/) is a response to your post. Good tips and links.
When you find a new job, don't give a God damn two week notice
Document Everything that has happened so far, Then continue to document as things proceed.  Dates, Times and People involved (people present) are important. Report this to Human Resources.    Even if you are finding a new job it is best to get this incident on the books.  At the bare minimum if might prevent it from happening again (maybe even to someone else).  You might even be identifying a Transphobe that the company did not know was present.
Report him
Go straight to a lawyer,  do not pass go,  collect bucks!   That’s horrible….so sorry it happened to you but you certainly have recourse.   Find a new job in the meantime,  you’re valid and deserve much better!
Wal-Mart. Why am I not surprised.
I’m a manager at Walmart.  I’ve had problems with being misgendered from employees.  Call ethics if the store manager doesn’t take care of it.  It might take a while for them to do anything but ethics will take it seriously and take care of it.
What job does role call? Mine we just punch in and out. I know during school If I had a sub I’d tell them my preferred name, then what it says on the role call and that I’m here
Hell I'd contact HR if you have one.

And the other management.
Go to hr..
The deadname is horrible. I'm going to go at this from a different/additional angle though.

Being autistic and having this manager purposely trigger you is a real issue.  If you're in the US he is likely breaking laws around that. (In addition to being a total d-bag.) That issue needs to be brought up with HR and reported to the state.

He's creating a hostile work environment for multiple groups of people. I'm certain if that comes to light he'll be spending time with an HR rep of he isn't outright fired for putting the store and company at risk.
Yea, Walmart and Amazon are two corporations to stay away from. Unhappy bitter people take command and don't care about human rights. To then you're a pawn that's replaceable.
You can reach out the ACLU for assistance with legal action.
wdym safety reasons?
Lmk if you think I should take him on a nice trip 👍
OP, Ik you said you don't have the money (Or energy) to get into a full-on war over this but most of the time, even the threat of legal action gets people moving.  
""Do I need to contact higher ups about discrimination in the work place?"" or the like since NOBODY wants their job threatened unless they REALLY dislike their job.
Report this to HR or your personnel staffer (who is technically above even the store manager though only for oversight purposes). As a former “Coach” (ASM) this is completely unacceptable behavior and constitutes harassment. Especially if they aren’t showing respect after you explained to them why that isn’t what you want to be called! If I was working there I would have recommended we put them on leave for a day to retake personnel management training cbls. This is a bad look for the store and company and just an overall shitty thing for a “leader” and “role model” to do. Sorry this happened to you :(
I work at walmart and can assure you that you need to report this to ethics. Im kinda stealth rn as well and get alot of flak but if they do this intentionally you need to report it to your store manager or lead and if the issue persists then call ethics and open door them. Walmart might be a shitty place to work especially overnights but for a manager to do this is considered transphobia and is against the companies policy. 

In short, report them and make it known that he is aware of what he is doing; as management is supposed to be trained on dealing with people like us including names and actions. 

If your store is aware of your condition regarding autism i also highly recommend you report them for abuse with a social worker or other third party as it will help stop this abuse and you might compensated for workplace abuse.
""Negligent infliction of emotional distress"" (NEID) is a personal injury law concept that arises when one person (the defendant) acts so carelessly that he or she must compensate the injured person (the plaintiff) for resulting mental or emotional injury. 

Talk to an attorney about this. One might be able to take you on contingency (pay nothing unless you win.) side note: this is not legal advice
I'd say you got it bent. I get it. That shit hurts, no doubt.what though. You ain't never been hurt before are humiliated.? What I thought. Take your butt right back in to that store and work just as hard as you always do and tell that asshole good morning and good night every day. BUT...... From now on you carry a small little recorder and every time some one treats you bad record that ass and post it rvru3here you can think to do so. Bet hisq don't know he or she act like that.  Make them 2ant to hide. You Rick and that it from me...Peace..out
Im so sorry man, you didn't deserve that. Sending love 💗
Get somebody pro Bono. There's so many people that want to help others that would take an easy case like this.
I'm so sorry this happened. He's an ass and you were well within your rights to be upset with him.
sorry that happened to you.  Sure sounds like there was an element of intention to dehumanize you.  Good luck to you, don't give up.  You matter.
This post feels like it could fit into the antiwork sub, not saying you should post there. But it definitely has the same vibe as other stories where the managers are completely disrespectful and lack any kind of compassion. I wouldn't doubt transphobia could play a role but these kinds of bosses also love making anyone that works for the feel small and miserable and sometimes it feels like they don't even need a reason.
I’d try brink in a wire that records sound and record things he says and does and also you can report to the police on harassment if he’s triggering autism on purpose and if possible show them security footage if it has sound even better
That’s so fucked. I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. I would totally go to HR about that. If you have it set up that your preferred name is on everything and they still purposely called out your dead name that’s definitely worth going to HR.
Complain to hr if there is one, idk if Walmart does. If your real name is on everything then he would have had no reason to deadname you than to piss you off. I would also suggest to just not respond to your deadname no matter how much he insists on using it. He’ll cave in eventually. It only depends on who has more determination and you definitely have him beat there no doubt.
Also, if I Canada, note that this sort of thing was recently ruled a human rights violation. Manager could absolutely have the book thrown at him if you can document a recurring issue with this.
Awesome advice. I just want to piggy back and say do these things even if you don't want/need the job anymore. Especially taking notes. Also, journal it out, for your own mental sanity too. <3
Yep! It’s a really similar approach to union worker stuff. Be diligent, write things down, and make sure that you don’t let shit slide.
Totally agreed, and also former employee here.  I had a situation that I reported on the hotline and it was dealt with within several days.  Corporate HR doesn't seem to leave a lot of wiggle room for harassment reported through open door.
That’s reassuring to hear ‘cause I work at Walmart, but I’m as closeted as I can be for the next ~30 days, then I’m starting hormones. Good to know that the managers will have my back, at least
I'm homeless living with my friends until winter is over and then I have to find my own place. I'm also a single parent with no car, so I have to he able to support my daughter and afford to go to and from work with uber. I pay my phone bill and rent every month. I have no choice. Jobs are hard to come by and I can't risk losing this one.
No don't fuck Walmart. You sue that ass for hostile work environment. And did you know that Walmart has stores all over the world. Go see some places on their dime ....uuuummmm. Transfer anyone
And if that doesn’t work go into gay and lesbian bars and write his phone number and name on all the bathroom stalls in marker .
Each of us had our name called and was assigned a department
I work with folk who are homophobic/transphobic
Please don’t work hard when selling your labor for an hourly wage. You get paid the same either way, and it just increases expectations for the entire workforce and makes for an unhealthy work environment where people who work at a casual pace are belittled and judged. Even if you’re working hard they are still going to pay you the least that they possibly can. Working hard in retail doesn’t improve your potential earnings or career path it just makes you a sucker, and increases your and everyone else’s workload for absolutely no benefit to the workers.
Oh man that's a dangerous mix. Recording abuse on the sly can be hella illegal depending on where you are. Also working harder or even as hard isn't always possible when anxiety is in the mix. When you are struggling to just function just going back into that environment is a test of strength in itself.
No they don't. Corporate hr takes all open door policy reports very seriously. Rightfully so too, it's what keeps them from getting sued a lot. Better to fire a hateful person than pay out a discrimination settlement. Corporate will 100% be on OP's side.
Yeah, I hear in certain places some managers will be assholes anyway but you can always open door it. Company policy ALWAYS has your side in a situation like that.
Find a new job before you quit this one, for sure. Finding a job within walking distance of home might be difficult so you do whatever you gotta do to be safe with you and your kid.
[Another person posted this on the thread and just wanted to make sure you see. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/qvxyll/got_deadnamed_in_front_of_all_my_coworkers_by_the/hkzar70/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
Sue? Lmao how much is a lawyer again…?
I mean I wouldt say it makes you a sucker but there isn't really any reason to work ""hard"" in retail or fast food. Go to work, do the minimum and get your money, because they will always find a reason to not give you a raise. And now that places are desperate to hire, the bar for the minimum is lowered even more. I honestly don't blame anyone who buys into the ""you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and start at the bottom and go up to the top"" mantra because it's repeated so often in our culture
For things like human rights violations or civil lawsuits you can usually get a lawyer for free initially so long as you have a winnable case. Then they just take a percentage of the payout once a judgement has been placed. It’s still kinda scummy as they usually take a substantial percentage of the payout, but that’s capitalism.
Attorney for this would be free, if they take the case... for a cut of the settlement.
Good to know, thanks! /genuine
Alternative there are also lawyers that operate pro bono.
Of course! Always glad to share some unsourced information from the back of my brain. 🙂

Calling all fellow trans men with long hair! I'm still pre-t and I get misgendered constantly. But I do not want to part with my hair. Hair is not gendered!		"As someone who grown up in an area between the countryside and the beach; pretty much all the guys had long hair, it's a good look for all men and it'd be cool to see it more! 

And I know you said you're pre-T but you look cis male to me, you kinda look like my cousin Brendan if he had better hair. Love the vibrant red color you chose too!
Just dropping to say I love your Helluva Boss Tshirt....
(Obviously hair aren't gendered)
Your hair fucking rocks and am mad envious! As someone going the other direction (MtF), but grew out my long hair before transition was even a topic, I had to deal with a lot of shit from folks about ""real men don't wear long hair"". 

Like....it's hair. Calm down.
I love your hair! It gives me 1970ies Rock Star vibes.
I love your hair! It suits you so well, if I saw you in public I would see you as male immediately. Also you remind me of Diluc from Genshin Impact
Your hair actually reminds me of an anime character (Cause I'm a weeb) who's literally the definition of healthy masculinity
OMG U LOOK SO COOL DUDE how to look like uuu 🔥🔥🔥🔥🔥 (also bonus point for the helluva boss shirt 👍)
Love men with long hair!!!!
That colour is so damn lit!   
I'm currently growing mine out after cutting it all off during lockdown to have it recover from all the dying in the past decade. I'm gonna go for a long mohawk next year. Either dark red or dark blue.
Men can have long hair, Jon Snow is a good example, keep on keeping on, king in the north!
tbh i cant really tell you're trans, and you look great!
You just remind me of Kirishima Eijirou from Boku no Hero Academia
I love your hair and shirt!
Bro. I'm a bit late but I relate so hard. As a trans man I wear my hair long & maybe it looks good but from certain angles I can't pass. You look straight up handsome my guy. Legit feelin gay for you lol
Love your hair dude! I’ve been growing mine out since I started t almost a year ago and, while I’m getting misgendered somewhat more frequently, I absolutely love having long hair. Hair isn’t gendered!
[removed]
I love your hair and the helluva boss shirt is rad man!
The grungey long hair look is great. As a fellow trans dude, I have long hair too but only bc I'm too lazy to call for a hair appointment lol
How do you get mis gendered? my feeble brain can not comprehend in what way you don't look like a male. (then again I do like 70's-80's classic rock musicians)
Pre t long haired trans man here, honestly same, only i wish i could have short hair but my parents act like its the end of the world when i mention it (i still live with them, im out to them too)
You have awesome hair, my guy! I'm considering growing mine out again.
You look like you could be a Final Fantasy guy character is all that came to my mind. Rock on! Fellow long-haired dude with an undercut here
You look like a FUCKIN GIGACHAD MATE WTFFFFF
Yeah dude pleez don't give up your gorgeous glam rocker hair.
i think your hair is really cool, if you don’t wanna part with it but feel like maybe you don’t pass to people and get misgendered then maybe try styling your hair in a man bun or styles considered ‘manly’ etc.
Your hair gives me Diluc vibes and I love it.
Bro wtf you look so much like a guy that I was surprised to read ‘fellow trans men’, you pass so hard that I would gender you correctly by default if I ever met you. Keep rocking that hair, it’s perfect on you.
Some of the best advice I can give to people, trans or otherwise, is to do whatever the fuck you want to do with your hair. It grows out of your head, it should only exist to serve you.
Normalize hot boys with long hair!
[deleted]
Transmale here, sup bro keep it punk!!! Love the style, i myself rock a hot pink mohawk with hellokitty tattoos...

You do you, as long as your happy!!
Your frickin hot dude you should be a rockstar frl
VOUCH
I’m transfem and have short hair and I love it
Looking pretty handsome over there! I love the hair!
Lots of dudes have hair like that. And it's kick ass.
Hair definitely isn’t gendered and it looks great on you 💕 you look amazing
Awesome shirt btw!
You look like a Rockstar my man, I wouldn't part with such a Glorious Mane either, also loving that Helluva Boss shirt, Rock on King <3
Long hair looks great on you anyhow! I'm also letting my hair grow as it pleases
As a pre-t myself I love my long hair and haven’t cut it off yet because of it. People say the only thing keeping me from passing is a few behaviors and my long hair. But if you like the long hair then keep it. They can’t decide for you
guys with long hair 🥰🥰
i relate as a trans gal with short hair 😭 like so many women have my exact haircut but cause im 6’1 im clocked 24/7 😖
you look like a cis male to me (apart from the things that are unchangeable without testosterone ofc)
i think this post was tailored for me lololol , my viciously thick hair is about at the bottom of my ribs & it’s dyed pastel pink. its hard, but i refuse to take away these parts of myself just because other people think they make me less masculine. if i was a cis girl id probably have cut it already because of how much of a struggle it can be to deal with, but my grudge against gender norms is stronger than any tangles in this big pink mop
I’m pre t and growing my hair out in a similar style. Boys with long hair are so cute. I tell myself I’m so handsome when it starts to bother me :)
You pass 100% in this photo btw
Trans Fem here. I get misgendered for not having long hair so it goes both ways
When i saw you i said they. Because i didnt want to hurt your feelings when i dont know what you use. Btw i like long hair too. But i look to much feminine. Thats why i cutted my hair. I like boys whit long hair I also want to have but I look girly and pepole thinks that I am a woman. But now I am okay whit short hair and love it. I hope I can try one more long hair one day, when I get on t.
You look good whit long hair, and I am proud of some of us do it. I am proud of you. Be yourself 😊
Got some like punk rock bed head style :3 looks good!!
Dude! Nice do. I would think that you’ll get less of the misgendering once your build starts to change, but until then, keep doing you. You’re rocking it.
yesss men with long hair sweep me off my feet
Damn that's a cool shirt dude
Love your shirt!
You look awesome. You look like a grunge rockstar dude
Love the Helluva Boss t-shirt, and your hair looks sick dude. You're allowed to have whatever hair you want, but I could see how that would make it easier to get misgendered. Still, I think the locks are worth it
I love your Helluva Boss shirt!
Your hair looks so good kinda jealous
I wouldn't either, you look dope!
You look like a cool JRPG Protagonist. Like one of those cool Final Fantasy dudes with the giant swords. Pretty Punk rock, dude.
Please excuse this, I’m only saying this to be constructive, and I’m trying to help.  From what I see, your face looks very smooth, and you seem to have really good skin.  I don’t know if you’re using a filter or makeup, or if this is how your face looks naturally, but I think that’s the one thing I see that might be perceived as feminine, unfortunately (I personally don’t like the idea that “beautiful” is often viewed as more of a feminine thing, as good skin should not be gendered).  Now, men can have good skin, and can use makeup, but when I look at myself (amab, gender questioning), I see my bad skin as something preventing me from looking as feminine as I’d like (I know, kind of hypocritical, but I’m viewing myself from the perspective of society).  I personally prefer a natural look without makeup when looking at others, and would be scared to try using makeup myself, so I say if you are using makeup, try going without, as I believe it could help until you’re on the T and growing facial hair (a little stubble will go a long way).  I do want to say, I wish my skin looked as good as yours, and I believe that skin like that should be the goal of people of all genders, but unfortunately it seems the norm is to perceive it as feminine.  We’re all about rejecting societal “norms” here anyway though, so if you can ignore their misgendering, do what makes you happy, have good looking skin, and keep that hair long.  We’re our own society, so we can create our own norms.
Honestly I would say you look like a male! You are rocking it dude!
True indeed, and your hair is cool!

What’s the shirt?
i gotta be honest, you remind me of cameron frye from ferris bueller’s day off, except if cameron had long, red hair
Eee I love your hair!

And your helluva boss t-shirt too!
you're back!! still popping in to say that you look like diluc (i see your tattoo, you're c6 diluc 

now!)if it makes you feel any better, you pass 100%.
Your hair is cool
Love 💖 your hair ❤️
You look quite masculine to me regardless ngl
Y'know, if you spiked up your hair, you'd kill it cosplaying as Axel from Kingdom Hearts. You rock that long hair, king!
🔥✊🏾
Dude you look like Diluc from Genshin Impact, He's cool looking (idk much my brother is the Genshin fan) but like but on a business suit ta-da easy cosplay, anyways YES Hair isn't gendered and you look really cool
You look so fucking cool!   I love it!
I like the shirt
You, my good man, are giving me gender envy. Also i like your Helluva boss shirt and i hope you have a good day/night
dude your hair looks so awesome
seriously, rockstar vibes
it looks fucking great and if anyone tells you otherwise, kick their sorry ass.
You’re damn handsome though ☺️
Your face is masculine ASF and I love the HB shirt
YOO YOUR HAIR IS SICK- A N D THE HELUVA BOSS SHIRT??? CHEFS KISS
Fucking dope hair, dude.
Side note, fckin love your shirt
Love the helluva boss tee :D
Your hair looks sick it’s cool guy hair
How do you get hair like that, daaamn it’s so cool
Keep your hair and badass shirt you got and what's the tattoo you have ?
Omg your cosplay is legit
You look like a lot of the skater bros my brother went to high school with. It’s a good look
Nice Helluveboss shirts
This might be a weird compliment, but I would feel pretty dysphoric if I looked like you (I’m transfem)

I’m surprised you get misgendered
I’m debating about growing my hair back out, maybe with an undercut type thing.  I get misgendered with short hair anyway.
Fucking gorgeous t-shirt. Stlitzo ♥️
personally, I think wearing a mask might help. It’d make you look more androgynous though, not really masculine. Your hair is fine though
H O l y fuck you are attractive-
(From an ace perspective anyway)
How do you get misgendered I see no female in your face nor anywhere else.
Also long hair on guys is metal as fuck
Tell that to my boss :(
Oh my god I love your hair. It matches your face really well and I think you pass !! Hair isn’t gendered and you represent that really well
i do not understand how you get misgendered. you look awesome!
For what it’s worth I definitely gender you male, it’s a great masculine long hairstyle.
You got this king! Show the world your long hair with pride ✨
I love your hair!! Also I love your shirt :))
I see your a man of taste with a sweet Helluva Boss shirt
your hair is absolutely sick!!!!!!! i’ve forced myself to have little boy haircuts for far too long, and just started to grow mine out too :) you are rocking the color btw
oml I love your hair and also that's a dope shirt
It's okay, even people who are Cis MAAB men before Trans became more widespread were/are misgendered as woman c:
That’s one helluva shirt
If Thor can pull it off, so can you, brother, I believe in you
[deleted]
Yess! Came here to say it too ^  ^
Love it! I have an Alastor and his shadow t-shirt
Same here!!
Agreed
I was gonna say this exact thing
I was just about to say that xD
I feel this in my soul got so many hair comments before coming out 🙄💜
I was thinking exactly this 👍
Thank you so much!
And I do get called Diluc quite often. German speaking country, wine area, grape growing, alcohol hating .. and my name is Luc. The jokes write themselves haha
Kirishima?
I could name several

Jason Momoa
Chris Hemsworth
Johnny Depp
Keanu Reeves
Jake Gyllenhaal
Harry styles
Daniel Radcliffe
Just commented this exact thing, strong Diluc vibes
I did try a man bun but it looks sooo bad on me. That weird glam rock shag mat is the only style that hides my big forehead and soft face shapes. Maybe it'll get better with t though. I'll see how it affects me
Savage

Edit: I hope you don't mind, I checked out your profile. Girl, I wanna punch whoever's doing this.
It's a double-edged sword. You may get misgendered because of the hair, but there's a few of us for whom long hair is plain necessary to frame our features right, hence actually less misgendering because of how your face appears.
I don’t know what skin thing you’re talking about to me he passes 100%
I agree the very soft skin and lips is likely what's leading people to misgender
He said he’s a trans man
Same! That's an awesome shirt 😍
Correct lol
I get that often to be honest haha. Thank you!
i think you pass really well in this pick tbh i would think you’re a cis guy
Your face shapes really aren't soft, you have very sharp cheekbones and a pointy, sharp-edged jawline.
ahhhhh ❤️❤️❤️
I’m simply trying to find anything that could lead to the misgendering that is happening.  It’s what was asked for, and I’m hoping my answer helps.
Okay I can't be the only one who headcanons Kiri as TransMasc.....right?
I get what he means to be honest. When I cut my hair short, my face looked round and soft af. I've also been told that I have sharp features.
Me and my best friend agree with you
Both Kiri and Denki give off trans vibes, and you can't change my mind
Hey, no, I *agree* with you, also semi popular opinion but Baku does too"	qy21dj	trans	1643	0.99	2021-11-20 09:24:25
I hate the hate for pronouns that aren't he/him, she/her, or they/them	"I told a friend my pronouns and he said:

""Look, I can respect he/him, she/her, and they/them, but this is where I draw the line. Why can't you just use he/him or they/them instead?""

""I prefer zhe/zhim, it's more comfortable.""

""It's too hard for me. Can I just call you he?""

""Please dont""

""Ehhh I'm calling you he. At least I don't use she lol""

I hate it. I hate how I have to use he/him instead because people say this kind of shit to me when I tell them my actual pronouns. I hate how if it isn't he/him, she/her, they/them, people, even queer people, will refuse to respect my pronouns.

I used to go by she/him, no one respected it. I asked them to use both but they only used she/her for me.

""yOu UsE sHe/HeR tOo WhY aRe YoU sO aNgRy??""

People told me to just use one. I couldn't decide between the 2 of them so I decided to just use it/its. My sister told me:

""Why?? Isn't it dehumanizing? Why can't you just use they/them?""

""I mean, yeah, it can be. Some people don't like it because it feels dehumanizing and it's not their pronouns. Don't use it/its for people who don't use those pronouns, but please use it for me! I like it, it's cool and I'm more comfortable with it/its than they/them.""

""I don't like using it for you. I feel like a bad person. I'll just use he/him.""

""Using it/its for me won't make you a bad person, you're just respecting my pronouns. Not using it/its is what will make you a bad person.""

""I still don't like it. I'm just going to use he/him for you.""

No one respected it. They told me it's weird and that they feel bad when using them. I was forced to use he/him instead.

I found out I was under the genderfluid umbrella and decided to change my pronouns depending on what gender I felt like. No one respected it and just used whatever pronouns they wanted to use for me.

""Wait, don't use he/him pronouns for me, I feel more she/they rn.""

""Ehh I feel like calling you he/him. Dw it's fine you also use he/him pronouns.""

No one respected my pronouns. I was too confusing. They told me to just stick with one pronoun instead. 

I decided to use zhe/zhim. People tell me it's too hard to use and that they don't know how to use it. I tell them how to use my pronouns but they still don't use them. They decided to just use he or she for me instead.

I hate how people tell me to just use they/them or he/him. I hate how people tell me neopronouns are weird. I hate seeing people (even queer people) debate about the validity of my pronouns. MY PRONOUNS ARE VALID PLEASE RESPECT THEM

I dont like using he/him because I'm under the genderfluid umbrella so sometimes I don't feel masculine. I don't like using she/her because I don't always feel feminine. I don't like using they/them because I just don't like with it. It doesn't feel like it's the right one for me.

Zhe/zhim is just so much better. It works when im fem, masc, and nonbinary. Unlike they/them, this one feels right to me. It's better than it/its because it has the letter z and z is my favourite letter. I wish people actually used it for me tho. They say it's ""too confusing"" and ""too hard to use."" Only one person uses it. Everyone else just uses she/her or he/him.

WHY CANT PEOPLE JUST RESPECT MY PRONOUNS ITS NOT LIKE IM USING SLURS FOR PRONOUNS WHY IS IT SO HARD?? STOP MISGENDERING ME STOP SAYING IM A MAN/WOMAN STOP MAKING ME BINARY. STOP SAYING IM A GIRL BECAUSE IM AFAB, STOP SAYING IM A BOY BECAUSE IM TRANS. STOP USING THEY/THEM FOR ME BECAUSE IM NONBINARY. JUST STOP,  PLEASE STOP.




Edit: Wow, thank you for all the neopronoun hate!! It is greatly appreciated, I'm so happy I got the hate I was complaining about! This is super awesome!! /s

I can't believe this is happening. We're all trans people but you're acting like how cis transphobes treat us. Just because you personally don't understand it doesn't mean it's not valid. Stop debating over whether I'm valid or not. I can't believe this is happening in a trans community, it makes me so sad.

Thanks to everyone who respects neopronouns tho!! It makes me really happy!! And thanks to everyone who doesn't understand but tries!! You're awesome! Here have a cookie 🍪"	"I don't get the hate around neopronouns/it/its pronouns either, like here's my approach to these things

Does XYZ affect other people?

If no respect XYZ

Like, it's not that hard
I find it difficult to handle neopronouns and to use them consistently. But i do really try. (Really helps if someone has a pronoun badge.)
I think a lot of people like the *idea* of being progressive but don’t think about the core ideas (e.g. empathy, universal tolerance, nonjudgemental curiosity, etc). Like, they’ll more-or-less follow the rules “don’t be racist, homophobic, sexist, transphobic, etc” but when something falls outside the rules they’ve learned, they stop practicing empathy and all that. They’ll make fun of people for being fat, or bald, or using neopronouns, having disabilities, etc as long as they still can claim they’re “following the rules” of progressivism

(Edit: I know baldness is a weird example, I don’t mean to equate it to the neopronoun thing at all. I included it because it’s a thing people think doesn’t matter, but as an older trans-femme it is extremely relevant to dysphoria. Hell, even cis people experience dysphoria from it. Again, not equating, just an example of a thing people are ok making fun of despite supposedly being progressive.)
I find the neopronouns a little strange but I would never do anything like that, if that’s what they want to be referred to as then that’s what I’ll do
Hey OP, what do you use as a possessive pronoun? 

(Or anyone else if zhe has answered this already & I just haven’t seen it!)
I can’t say I understand the appeal of neo pronouns myself, but if someone told me that they used neo pronouns I’d do my best to respect them, whatever those pronouns were. Just because I don’t understand it doesn’t mean it’s okay for me to ignore and erase their identity - that would make me no better than a transphobe.
Problem with neopronouns is you need to have a group prepped to use it, otherwise people default to he/she or they if they are totally confused.  It is considered offensive and considered calling them an object rather than a person, xer and such are considered off the beaten trail.  That all said, it should be possible to have your local friend group and work be able to gender you correctly.  If they can't they are shit friends and shit work, gendering someone correctly is the simplest thing you can do, we aren't asking for you to help move all the shit in our house or to help cut down a tree and move the debris, it fucking changing some words>.>

That said, misgendering might pop up from time to time as society is defaulted to he/she more or less.  We live in a very binary society and people default to it, even people you know as brain might take over and say 'oh yea looks like boy call them he'.  

Like I said, you need a better group of people but not sure what else to say.
My big issue with neopronouns is internal, I will beat myself up for forgetting them and that self anger (I’ve been told by a friend) can come across as resentment towards xem. We’re still friends and xe/xem/xyrs is becoming *less* of a mind fuck for me, but it’s like learning singular they, with even more of a curve. 

I’m sorry that people use the difficulty as an excuse not to use your pronouns thoughtfully, that’s really shitty.
Hey im sorry folks are disrespecting you like this. I think neopronouns are cool. It seems like one of those things that will become more normal with time. Like how they/them and being nonbinary was just ""too far"" not that long ago. A lot nore people are growing to accept nonbinary folk and hopefully soon theyll learn to accept people who use neopronouns.
Yikes, OP needs some serious support IRL. Zhe asked for so little but zhe got “ehhh I’ll just do this thing you hate” instead. Can’t people just listen to zhim? Not that hard.
It really urks me when people refuse to even try to get your pronouns right because its “too hard” like, yes using neopronouns in a sentence for the first time is hard, but just?? try?? 
im sorry people have been treating you this way, you rlly deserve better friends :(
Do I get neopronouns? It’s something I have a hard time getting sometimes admittedly. 


Do I respect them and the people that use them? Yes. English is a constantly evolving language and this is a part of that process.
In my language there's no ""they/them"". There's not even an ""it"", even objects have genders. It's absurd!! And, as someone who uses the pronoun that is considered as the translation of ""they/them""... I just want to say that i understand your pain. I'm sorry you have to go through this, but you're not alone in your fight. And I will respect your pronouns and anyone's too. It's a promise :)
“I don’t like neopronouns” “I find them strange” “I don’t understand…” 
You are legit in a trans forum. 
I PERSONALLY cannot understand why people who understand transitioning and the challenges that come with them would bash someone else for pronouns. Most of us struggle here and really love when people use the right pronouns so please respect OP.
I've never met anyone with neopronouns, but I would try my hardest. I don't use neopronouns, but sometimes I feel more neutral and flexible with them (as long as it's not she/her), so I wouldn't mind if someone used they/them or even neopronouns for me. 

It's kind of ironic that I see this post when I literally just got into an irl argument defending neopronouns. My friend, one of her friends I'd just met, and my sister starting talking about their LGBTIA identities when the girl I had just met suddenly exclaimed, ""Not to be rude, I support everyone, but if you use neopronouns don't fucking talk to me"".

The other girls including my sister agreed, going on about how _**they feel**_ like it's making a mockery of trans people who use she/her, he/him, or they/them pronouns. None of them asked for my opinion on it so I just watched them talk and didn't say a word because I suddenly felt like I was no longer in safe space.

This is such an issue with cis people and it's not funny at all. STOP TALKING OVER TRANS PEOPLE. If your cisgender ass and your cisgender friends are having a conversation about trans people and the ONLY trans person in the room is completely silent, THAT'S NOT A GOOD SIGN.
I understand the neopronouns like ze, xe, ey, it (though using it I personally struggle cuz it feels like im dehumanizing people) and stuff like that but I cannot wrap my head around nounself ones, if someone could explain thatd be awesome
I feel like whatever makes people happy and comfortable go for it! It's no skin off your nose to call someone what they like to be called
Who gives a shit just use what someone wants to use. I think it's neat the kids are coming up with new pronouns
Trans is beautiful. We, each and every one of us recreate gender and our very selves in the image of our soul. People like OP take it a step further (a step ""queerer,"" if you will, not that queerness can be calculated). Zhey recreate in zheir own image not only zhemselves and the so-called fundamental aspect of humanity that is gender, but also language itself.

Neopronouns are beautifully queer
Is it ok for me to ask how these pronouns are pronounced? That would be the only problem I’d have with them, is if you texted them to me and I wouldn’t know how to pronounce them. But once you told me how they are pronounced, I would say those pronouns. Everyone deserves to use the pronouns that they’re most comfortable with. I’m a trans man, and I know what it’s like when people don’t call you the right thing. I’d never, in a billion years, tell you that you can’t use those words. It’s beyond comprehension, to me. I’m so sorry you’re going through this. Hope you can surround yourself with people who will be respectful
I think non-traditional / neopronouns are neat.

I don't use them for myself, despite being genderqueer / genderfluid / confusing pile of gender whatever. I'm too old. Too old for the cool new pronouns. 

Besides, the people in my personal life won't even use they/them for me. So why bother trying to find something else I like better?

I don't see what the big deal is though. Adopting new pronouns isn't all that different from adopting a new nickname. And it makes the people who use them happy when you say them.
I fucking despise pronoun discourse like this because at the end of the day, the people in power who hate all trans people don't hate all trans people because some of us use neopronouns.

Throwing that cat/catself person under the boot won't save your face from being stomped on.
I hate the whole “oh neos are bad cause confusing/new/weird” rubbish. They are what the person chose to represent them, and anything else is just blatantly ignorant. Neos are real, they are used, and sure, you don’t have to exactly understand them, but that isn’t an excuse to ignore them and people who use them, because just like how only you get to define what your gender is, only you get to choose what your pronouns are, and being assholes to people who use Neos only hurts the community as a whole.
I use it/its and he/him, once I mentioned my friend how I really liked it/its pronouns in comparison to he/him and he was like ""Alright I'll use that one more then"" and I smiled so hard.

I mostly use he/him for other people's comfort but I also don't mind them, prefer it/it's tho they make me feel good about myself. 10/10 Would recommend using people's preferred pronouns you could be making their day.
Neopronouns can be hard to learn to use but I practice forming sentences that might get said a lot. It requires practice but so does learning how to pronounce someone's name sometimes. It's just basic respect to learn how to use someone's pronouns.

I use ze/zim! Also they/them but my friends know I also have neopronouns.

No one should misgender you just because they don't care enough to learn your pronouns. That's just transphobia. People use it/its all the time for babies and small children (""is it a boy or a girl?"") despite knowing children are human, so someone picking it/its pronouns should be fine.
I don’t understand why ppl can’t just respect pronouns. Like even if your uncomfortable with any sort of pronouns, YOU SHOULD STILL USE THEM. Like I’m uncomfortable with christians does that mean I’m gonna go around disrespecting them? NO. I still will respect, listen and validate them no matter my feelings. I am so sorry you had to go through all this crap. And to all the queer ppl also disrespecting zhim, you are literally treating ppl the way you hate to be treated.
i’m perfectly fine with neopronouns, my only thing is i don’t know how to pronounce some of them if i only read them and don’t hear them out loud. that’s just me being kinda stupid though. i feel bad about all the hate neopronouns get, it really isn’t deserved. like anything, it’s something people have to adjust and get used to, but people are never *going* to adjust if they just dismiss it immediately and don’t even try. at the end of the day, it’s none of your (the royal you) business why people identify the way they do and their relationship to gender, all you have to do is respect it. 

the amount of neopronoun hate in the lgbtq community, including on this post where OP is *literally complaining about neopronoun hate* is uncalled for, feeding into harmful stereotypes, and echoing cishet logic of “wElL tHaTs NoT rEaL, iM nOt GoNnA uSe ThOsE pRoNoUnS oR tHaT nAmE.” smh guys, you lot should know better.
[removed]
Did zhe not say clears? Respect. Zhis. Pronouns. We know some of you don't like neopronouns, you keep saying that. Do it for zhim. Zhe has endured enough bullshit, it's time to give zhim some love.

Sorry to be so blunt, but this was needed.
Ugh I hate that shit so much. If I tell you my pronouns then those are my pronouns. If I say she/her don’t fuckin use they/them. That’s like me callin a very much cis guy by she/her. My “friend” Robbie is so bad about this. I literally don’t think he’s ever used my correct pronouns and always just days she/her and because he has a short fuse to say the least he gets pissed at me for correcting him. At this point if he doesn’t stop I’m gonna start callin him by she/her till he either gets the hint or one of us tells the other to piss off
I wish I could use my neopronouns more and hate the fact my native language doesn't have them :( I am sorry you get misgendered I know that feeling and I hate it too
Some neo pronouns are pretty common where i live, so i (try) to understand the struggle, im sorry you have to deal with bigotry like that
ITS YOUR IDENTITY, not there’s, not zhim’s, not xe’s, and definitely not fucking hers, it’s WHAT YOU decide for you, no one can take that away from you. I am in similar boat, my partner accosted me the last year just to try and get a “him” out of him… 
You Are Valid to me <3 
This community comes up with some weird fucking names to call themselves, youd think they’d be able to  handle something a little outside of the box 🫠 

I FEEL for this.  Message me anytime to rant about the so called queer community <3
I use she/her mainly but I have others I'm too scared to tell people about... so I understand
I don't understand the point of neopronouns at all
For me it’s twofold, often they involve syllables that to my knowledge don’t even exist in my language. I can’t easily pronounce them, at that point it’s easier for me to just avoid interacting with that person. if it’s online then it’s more that it’s using terms that people aren’t familiar with and it doesn’t come naturally without stopping and pausing. Not to start on ones involving regular nouns which I’ve met people that use and I just cannot work with, sentences break down before I can get them out of my mouth and are near impossible to read on screen/paper.
People get mad when you use they them as a pronoun and get mad when you don’t.
[removed]
Neo pronouns are hard for me, but I think that is only because I don’t know anyone who uses them. I view it the same way that I view any other preferred pronouns. I feel awful whenever I have to use he/him over she/her, and I assume the same is true for you. You found the words that make you feel the most valid and excepted, and anyone who doesn’t respect that is just being an ass.
I can understand ppl struggling to use them since it's newer and forgetting but if they don't even try they don't respect you.
[removed]
I’m so sorry people are being assholes in the comments, your pronouns are valid and you should get to decide how everyone addresses you, no one else. Using neopronouns like zhe/zhim is no different than using something like they/them they’re all just words and it’s frustrating to see people even in this community be assholes about it. All the best to you OP
i thought you were dissing on neos for a second and i got rlly scared lol, i hope u find some people that respect ur pronouns :((
Thank you for being vulnerable about this, I used to think neopronouns were silly but posts like this indicate they really matter to some folks

Also zhe/zhim is fun to say so people are missing out :)
Yeah they/them pronouns don’t fit me either. The thing is no one could argue my pronouns confuse them because my pronouns are literally he/him but my family use they/them or she/her pronouns anyway because I’m AFAB and they think I’m non-binary or just not valid even though I have specified many times that I’m a boy and they should just treat and refer to me like any other boy. I don’t know anyone with neopronouns and I don’t really know what they mean but I still think they should be validated and respected.
I’m sorry people in your life and people in these comments are mean to you. You deserve to be called whatever pronoun YOU feel comfortable with and you deserve people who make you feel included by using your correct pronouns.
Its really not that hard to just respect someone’s decision even if you don’t understand it. People do it all the time but when it comes to pronouns, all of a sudden it’s the hardest thing in the world. And the worst part is those in the queer or leftist communities who wont use neopronouns. Like how does that logic work
It's petty and bitchy, but just start referring to them by the wrong pronouns on purpose. Give them a taste of what it feels like
sorry for these comments :( i think ur pronouns r cool
I agree! I hate when people don’t respect neopronouns it doesn’t hurt you to use the pronouns but it does hurt the person your misgendering!
Out of curiosity, how would one pronounce those pronouns? Might steal em myself lol
All i ask is if you have Neopronouns, you please tell me how to use them grammatically.

For you, Zhe/Zhim would be easy, as it is literally just a Z in front of He/Him (Z in front of him, Replace S in she with Z? Idk doesn't matter)

Idk I'll always respect Neopronouns if you give me the means to be able to.
i hope you can find people irl who’ll respect you. pronoun choice is not for the comfort of others. misgendering like this is not okay.
Why can't we as a community realize that obviously the neo pronouns are not as comfortable for people to use. Yes it sucks! They/them has been around a lot longer and outlasted so many others because of it's ease to use in the English language. If you want to go by an odd pronoun you'll have to practice some mindfulness. It doesn't help to have expectations that people will find it easy to use. I will try my ass off to use the correct pronoun for people and it's frustrating to me when people dont even try, but you have to have some understanding around that as a human being. People aren't used to it. Find your inner peace. I know pronouns are a big deal, but they might not be as big as forming positive connections with our friends and bringing down the walls that separate us. I get your rant completely. I hope you find some peace.
TLDR: Be persistent and firm about your pronouns being used. They are YOURS.

You pick your pronouns that you feel the most comfortable with, honestly

Even if that means going back to something someone else said no to

If that one makes you feel the most at home in your skin, that is yours.

YOUR pronouns are not to be dictated by anyone else.

If they don't use the pronouns that YOU said to use to refer to YOU, then they shouldn't refer to you at all.

In fact, have the mindset that they have.

Your sister wouldn't think that someone means her if someone refers to her as a them or a he, bc she uses she/her/hers

If your pronouns are zhe/zhim/zheirs, then that is what you react to.

If someone refers to you without that, ask them who they mean. If they don't correct themselves, let them know ""that isn't how you refer to me."" and correct them. Tell them the proper way to refer to you.

If they continue not refering to you correctly, that's disrespectful. It's not hard. It doesn't hurt them whatsoever, they just do not *want* to.
dUDE? WHY ARE THEY?? TELLING YOU?? NOT TO WORRY?? THEYRE JUST MISGENDERING yOU??

like.

YO??

tf. 

i do have a question tho: is it pronounced “zay” or “zee” or “zeh”. i just wanna practice a lil.

edit: nvm, i read your reply to someone else :)
What’s the difference between they/them and zhe/zhim
I need an explanation of Neopronouns, I seriously need one before I accidentally upset people
I have a learning disability and ADHD, so if I can’t make connections that help me understand certain words, for example, it makes retaining and regurgitating information extremely difficult. I’ll always do my best to be respectful of all pronouns, but I have to ask people repeatedly to be patient with me because I’m genuinely struggling to keep track of how and when to use them with which people. I also have no idea how to pronounce them all and I’m in a constant state of panic that I’m going to offend someone.

A lot of us may seem ignorant or hateful, but we’re really doing our best trying to keep up and retain new information across a wide spectrum. We care, we just need some grace while we work on keeping up!
This is all reminding me of invader zim
Here, have a dose of euphoria. 

“Oh, Italic_Text is so nice. Zhey always help me!”
i'm so sorry, those people really suck. the casual misgendering here is on another level fr.

neopronouns can be pretty confusing, i gotta say - but i'm damn well gonna try my absolute bloody best to get them right.

zhe/zhim seems a fairly easy one to me, too - the pronunciation seems fairly straightforward.
yes! then you get to see how many binary trans people are transphobic and get pissed at you for using neopronouns because “neopronouns are dehumanizing”
I don't hate them but i don't understand them either. I feel like they/them fits very well for intersex, non-binary, 2-souls and pretty much everything that isn't he or she.
Jesus Christ. You know what I do in these situations? Call you by your name.

My two cents: I’ve never understood it, but I will still use it when referring to someone. Lack of understanding isn’t an excuse to be an asshole
Don't give them the space for disrespect. Hell, get passive aggressive and pick their pronouns for them too... If they get to disrespect your wishes that is an invitation to disrespect theirs. And if they get made point out how they are being hypocritical because, seriously, f- them. Not worth your time or effort, if they can't respect something as essential as your pronouns, they don't respect you.
The fact of the matter is we just don't have an agreed upon word for a lot of the spectrum, the problem isn't with how you identify it's that there's no agreed upon pronouns for certain places on the spectrum. It's not that it's invalid it's that we need words for it
This. I have two sets of neopronouns I prefer over anything else. I ended up settling for he/they because no one respected it anyway.
I hate when people do this, I use any pronouns I was telling this to a friend of mine and this is how it went.

Me: I use any pronouns .
Them:what about neopronouns?
Me:yeah those are fine too I really don't care.
Them:thats so weird why would you be okay with that? Just choose she/her, he/him or they/them.

I hate it, neopronouns are just as valid as any others. Although I do have one question how do you pronounce zhe/zhim? I've never heard those before.
Aaaa I'm sorry for alot of these comments OP. Your pronouns are yours alone to dictate and it seems you need more supportive people around you who at least try to understand. As someone who also uses neopronouns it's very upsetting to see other trans people use transphobic rhetoric against people who use neopronouns. 😓
I feel your pain. I know that while my online friends do respect my pronouns no matter what (since I’m not wasting my time and energy on interacting with people who don’t respect me online), most irl people will not. While I am comfortable with they/them in English (and also he/him but only if you don’t always call me that) - my favorite set of pronouns in English is thon/thons btw - there is no equivalent to they/them in German, the only options are just she, he, it, neopronouns and no pronouns in that language, and since people speak German where I live I’m kind of forced to speak it in my everyday life. Being called she gives me intense dysphoria, so that’s the one thing I want to avoid. I feel most comfortable using neopronouns (dey/deren) or no pronouns (just my name) in german, but since I know the vast majority of cis people will not respect those pronouns and just keep defaulting back to she/her (because I don’t pass as anything but female unfortunately) I felt forced to use he/him irl in the past. The thing is, while I kind of like small amounts of he/him in English I definitely don’t like being called he in German. It’s probably because the language is so agressively gendered, so the combination of all the masc nouns and adjectives and the pronouns is just too much (I do like the masc forms of most words tho). Also, cis people didn’t fucking respect the he/him pronouns either! At that point I just gave up and started telling people irl to use no pronouns for me, just to use my name.

I just hate that so many people, even other trans people, are such transphobic pieces of shit who will blatantly misgender people who use more unusual pronouns. Those who give you shit for it on this subreddit should be ashamed of themselves, we trans people, no matter what our genders and pronouns are, need to support each other, because if one kind of trans person gets pushed under the bus the rest of us will soon go down as well. We’re in this together. If we of all people don’t respect each other’s pronouns, who will?
I didn't understand them until my egg cracked. Being called ""she"" makes me comfortable and happy, so it makes sense that the word would be different for others. I don't know how to justify it to people who haven't experienced euphoria or dysphoria, but I don't think it needs to be justified. It makes people happier and doesn't harm anyone, it must be good.
I completely agree. If someone tells you their pronouns, do your best to respect it. It might take time, but apologize when you say the wrong thing. It’s all about practice.
That fucking sucks! I'm so sorry you had to experience such discrimination and dismissiveness of your identity and feelings. 

You are valid and fuck anyone that tries to gate-keep our community. The majority of us support you but we fail to speak up because we assume everyone is cool with neopronouns.
Some people believe the pronoun you use should reflect something substantial about yourself, but most people don't really know the objective implications of zhe/zhim particularly.
I'm rlly sorry you have some awful ppl in your life! also! ignore the assholes saying neopronouns are too difficult or are bad for the community. they're wrong. it's like trying to take the 't' out of lgbt, or trying to say aro/ace ppl don't belong in our community. it's exclusionism to try to appeal to shitass cis ppl and it doesn't work, it just hurts ppl.

anyways! ik I seem like the stereotypical trans guy or trans masc to a lot of people in my life, but honestly my preferred pronouns are he/xe. I usually say they're he/they, or he/xe/they. I understand the struggle with ppl not respecting neopronouns. I rlly wish they would. I not all that comfy with they/them bc it's been used to hurt me in a lot of ways. but I'm not just he/him. I wish I could say he/xe and have people accept it, without having to add the they bc ik ppl won't use xe. and it feels important to me to be able to convey that my gender is more then binary male without having to go into the specifics.

Ive been much more visible and pushy abt my neopronouns as of late, bc ik I have trans siblings like you out there. I'm often the ""token good trans"" so I'm trying to use that power for good. 

I hope you find more people who care abt you enough to actually respect your pronouns. you'll find your community eventually<3
I completely respect neopronouns! Those people who don't respect your identity aren't worth your time. I hope you can find people who respect who you are as a person!
To be honest I don't have any friends who use Neo pronouns anymore but when I did I made an effort to learn how to use them- even if I didn't understand them too much. If it makes the person happy then isn't that what matters? 
I hope OP can find better friends, zhe deserve it.
I don't think the neopronouns are OP's problem, honestly. Sure, zhir friends are being shitty about them, but from the abundant examples zhe gave it sounds like they're pretty shitty about anything that's not using whatever pronoun they feel like at the time. Sounds like zhe might need new friends.
Zhe/Zhim is soooooo freaking cool! How is it pronounces??
OP, if you see this, my condolences on the shitty behavior from your friends and loved ones. Your personal pronouns are just that: personal. Thanks for the brave post and for putting words to things I’ve felt and experienced for the 10+ years I’ve been out and in the trans community. 💖💖💖 
Sincerely, an it/its user who just lurks in this sub because of people like the ones you describe
[deleted]

Looks like I missed the shitstorm.
I use neopronouns, but I don't tell people about them because of this. I already get enough shit for being a they/he, afab, feminine looking transmasc who wants neutral language except when it comes to compliments. My binary trans ex made fun of me for neopronouns and xenogenders as well as the specific way I'm trans because it doesn't fall into there idea of nonbinary. I just want to scream that they cant be trans supportive if they make fun of the specific way I'm trans.
I feel like this is why people wanna kill us… just sayin
Personally I use they/them by default because it absolutely conforms to classical English rules for any person it could possibly reference, but if someone told me they wanted me to use different pronouns for them you bet your sweet azz I would try my best! If people aren't going to support you or at the very least lightly respect you, then it's on them, not you. I'm sorry cis people can't respect you, my fellow alien!

(If alien is offensive, I don't know, I just like the concept of being an alien; space is neat)
OP, I’m sorry you’re feeling so disrespected in your daily life. You deserve better. 

Anybody else saying they don’t understand, check out https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/ and do your own research because it’s not on OP to explain zhimself to us
Here's the thing, most people aren't educated on what neo pronouns really are. Neo pronouns are attached to some really homophobic memes, they were sort of the thing that made a lot of Transphobic people point at us and go ""this person is making up new genders look at how stupid this is!"" Etc.


A lot of people in our own community don't even know what they really are.

We aren't yet to the point where neo pronouns are known of other than them being ""made up genders"" (which is such an un educated assumption it's so dumb) and the stigma behind them will continue to make it harder for people who use them.

We're not yet there, it sucks that the people around you won't even put in the effort.

You don't have to understand to at least respect someone's pronouns. Your personal opinions shouldn't get in the way of someone doing what makes them comfortable.
I accept that everyone is allowed the pronouns they identify with but I find it hard when it’s new language. I know a lot of older people who are from a different generation have issues with this. Wouldn’t it just be better to use the persons name and not use pronouns at all. I mean why would this cause an issue with the gender fluid person?
Lol I like how everyone in this sub is giving their (not requested) opinion about whether or not they “understand” neopronouns. This is a venting post, not an advice post. I’m sure most of us can relate to being misgendered and forced into boxes. There’s no need to add your two cents about the understandability of OP’s pronouns.
“It’s too hard” isn’t an excuse when they’re learning and using new words and terms every week. Like you learned an entire language, maybe two, learning a new pronoun isn’t hard, it’s just practice
Bruh I swear why can’t people just not be transphobic? Like i feel like the only way I might use em wrong is by either me mispronouncing them or not know how to use them but you said that you explained to them how to use your pronouns and probably also pronounced them to. For fucks sake I’m cis and even i know how to use your pronouns it’s not hard to say zhe/zhim instead of literally anything they want to use
As a fellow neos users, I feel you OP. You deserve respect.
Some people are incredibly lazy. Lazy enough to squeeze someone inside their limited vocabulary and understanding. I get so angry when people have to go through stuff like this. Same for the OP here. Zhe definitely deserves better people around zhim. :(
I have exactly one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me (I am comfortable with both ze/zir and she/her, but ze/zir has a bit more of a connected feeling to me).

I really wish more people would try. It shows respect and compassion towards me. I also find it unacceptable for people to not use neo pronouns when that is the only pronoun that feels correct to a person. I'm sorry you are dealing with this.

(if I may) _\*hugs\*_
[removed]
Those people are stupid, your pronouns are zhe/zhim so people should refer to you by zhe/zhim, they shouldn't decide what your pronouns are, it's your pronouns. not theirs.
[removed]
i fully respect zhe/zhim, but my brain is ruined and to me it reads like an old German man complaining about someone...

that being said, OP is reasonably angry, zhe deserve to have their pronouns respected

to be honest i don’t understand neopronouns as much. not in a disrespectful way, just that i can’t keep track and sometimes it’s hard for me to remember. But i will always respect it and use them for people if they want me to. My friend and I just had a conversation about it. I’m trans and people weren’t calling me the correct pronouns. And how people need to understand how to respect people. You don’t need to understand something to respect it. I don’t understand sometimes, but I respect still.
Using different pronouns really isn’t difficult, they’re just making excuses not to try. Idk if it’s just me being very accustomed to different pronouns but it really is not hard at all. I’m sorry you had to experience that, it’s so frustrating 😞💕
The amount of people literally spreading neopronoun hate on a post about neopronoun hate, and the amount of upvotes they have, is very upsetting.
NEOPRONOUNS ARE VALID

I don't use neopronouns but I respect those who do. Kudos to you for breaking lingual gender constructs. I hope you get to make friends who respect your pronouns.
First of all: that sucks :( booooo 
2nd, how do you use those in a sentence? I don't know many people who use neos an most of them are *noun*/*noun*self, so it's not too different from regular he or she or they. Im not too used to xe or zhe or e or stuff like that
3rd: I totally understand not feeling comfortable with normal pronouns. While I use he/him most of the time, i also occasionally use bee/bees/beeself, but usually I don't tell people about those so they don't get used :/
As someone who uses it/it's neos, I understand. Of course, I can't understand 100% bc I use he/him too. I am so sorry that you have to deal with that, I really hope it gets better soon
As a xe/xir I absolutely feel you, when people ask I just say they/he because they NEVER remember.
i relate hard, as someone using neopronouns myself. lots of trans people, LET ALONE cis people don't get it.

Lemme just say it for the people in the back:

> Neopronouns are a category of new (neo) pronouns that are increasingly used in place of “she,” “he,” or “they” when referring to a person. 
>  
> Some people prefer using neopronouns as an alternative gender neutral pronoun set. This could be because they want to avoid singular ""they"" being confused with plural ""they"" because neopronouns express something about them or their gender (like xenogenders), or because they feel more comfortable using neopronouns over any of the standard pronoun options.

Oh and have a [link](https://neopronoun.carrd.co/) about neopronouns.

People are so annoying, my god! I don’t understand neopronouns or why anyone would use them, but if people feel comfortable being called something other than she/her they/them or he/him I will try as hard as I can to use their pronouns correctly! Sorry you’ve had such shitty experiences. I hope you find some friends who can respect your pronouns. Zhe/zhim is 100% valid <3
Maybe it would help this person if you explained to them what zhe/zhim means and why it makes you feel more comfortable

The beet we can do is explain, it’s the only way to combat other people’s ignorance. And when that fails walk away; they’re rarely worth it
People who dont experience it dont understand often and its sad. I wish you the best, and hope you can find someone who will resepct your pronouns and who you are
Gender is a social construct and thus pronouns are an extension of that. Society and the language we use are familiar with the pronouns he/him, she/her, they/them, but neopronouns aren’t used enough commonly to really weigh as much as the others as far as I can tell. While the honest thing to do would be to respect someone’s pronouns regardless of what they are, it is also understandable that people may not find it entirely applicable. This of course is my thoughts on the matter.
hot take: ive never understood why people say “gender is a construct!” then completely 180 when it comes to xenos and neopronouns.
I use she/him and there’s exactly one person in my life who actually uses my pronouns ;-;
Zhe/zhim
As a cis person, I get not understanding, but I don't get not respecting OP as a person. Everyone, including zhim, deserves to have their pronouns respected. It's not that hard when you get over yourself and give your best effort. People understand that you won't be perfect about it at first.

My biggest issue is that I can barely remember faces and names, best I can do is they them if I don't talk to you on a regular basis because otherwise I would have to guess
I’m sorry🥹🥲
I don't understand the use of it/its, I feel like it is dehumanizing, and I don't understand what the other pronouns represent... I use She/Her... but that's for me.

Even if I don't understand neopronouns, I believe because I am a binary transgirl, it doesn't mean I can avoid using others' pronouns. If you feel like using a certain pronoun, my opinion doesn't matter, I must and will use your prefered pronouns. You want to use it? I will use it for you because it makes YOU feel ok with yourself.

It's not something hard to do to respect one's pronouns. Who wants to be called it I will call it, who uses she I will call she, who uses ze i will use ze. People must be respected, so those who don't respect the pronouns you want to be called as, they are all just assholes.
So. I have no problem with them. But every time I hear Zhim... I swear I just think of Invader Zim. And it's not that I think it's funny.. it was just my favorite show as a kid lol.
So, I have issues with the neopronouns because nobody I know uses them. Also, I am autistic with ADHD and my brain is complicated enough right now trying to understand some of the new information about how it works. My child is non-binary and prefers they/them. OK cool! I am a transman, so I respect their wishes. However, there are some days where they come out and go ""hey! I feel more feminine today! Use she/her!"" That alone throws my brain for loopsies. Then, when I finally get brain to comprehend, I go ""OK!"" Then...next day were back to they/them. 

So, from a NT pov, they have no reason to really fight these neopronouns once they are used to it and reminded to use them and if they fight back, go no contact for a bit. From a ND pov...it is a very grey area bc there is a lot more going on up there than what we show. I honestly do try to learn all of the stuff that pops up in our community, is just...takes a bit for brain to truly comprehend what is being said. Is very tiring. But in all honesty, I really hope the people in your life get MUCH better at accepting your pronouns and using them correctly.
I’ve never understood the hate for those types of neopronouns either. Like the ones that are like nouns, I get being confused by them and a lot of people just say ‘I’m not gonna do that’ because it’s weird, but the ones that are remaking he/him, she/her and they/them are all fine because you can just try to compare it to the main three in your head
I'm on team ""call me whatever"". I absolutely respect pronouns, but I do find it exhausting. If it means a lot to someone, I don't see it as a huge inconvenience. It does make people hard to interact with though. If you get fired up every time someone accidentally genders you, that will make sure you have few friends.
The only pronoun I use to address someone is you. Just use their name, problem solved.
I can understand neopronouns but habits are hard to break. We’ve been conditioned to expect a certain set of pronouns so when new ones are added, it’s a bit difficult to adjust. I do my best, but I usually use they if I’m not sure. 

Being 100% honest, I’m just thankful when folks use the right pronouns for me, and I use they/them. Do I feel like a they? No, but it’s better than being binaried. Unfortunately, not everyone is going to get it, but those that do should be cherished and loved.
I feel like the queer community is veering off onto a path that doesn’t resonate with me anymore. I support you doing whatever you want but all these kids using gender identities that were created yesterday is a little exhausting to me. But I don’t wanna be that bisexual hypocrite that views this as a stepping stone to your true identity when I’ve been told that about my sexuality.

I just feel bad for the binary trans people that have to share a label with a million other identities that aren’t even technically trans by definition. It’s not lost on me that in the 2000s, edgy emo was the trend, in the 2010s, indie hipster was the trend, and now, gender non conforming is the trend.

I just hope it’s a legit thing people are going through and not a way to enter the community without actually being queer.
i’m going to go through these comments and downvote all neopronoun hate. neopronouns are valid asf.
only pronouns i refuse to use is it/its, because trauma.

i grew up gnc with an ftm parent and a homophobic father. my parent and i were called an “it” on many occasions in a degrading manner, so anytime i see someone exclusively use that as a pronoun i avoid them because i can’t come to terms with that right now.

i won’t ever call someone out on this or give them shit if that person’s friends refer to them that way, but i just can’t. call me transphobic, i wont put my comfort behind someone else’s
I have to talk to way too many people every day just to remember a special set of pronouns just for you, I’m sorry.

""Hate"" is a strong word.

I completely respect it, but how do i use this in a different language so im properly identifying you? That’s the only major issue I have with neopronouns. I also speak Spanish so I want to be sure when i’m speaking i dont use él or ella but ig in this instance you wouldn’t prefer usted, which is as neutral as it gets. but then there’s many grammatical things that i have trouble with.
I don't really ""get"" neopronouns. I'd even go so far as to say they sometimes seem kind of silly to me.

The key word there being *me*.

I've got enough empathy to recognise that they don't seem that way to the people who use them. 

And it's a trivially small effort on my part to try to remember and use whatever pronouns someone asks for.

So yeah. I don't get it, but there's a lot of things I don't get but still support, and this is one of them.
I agree with many parts of this post, but I kinda get irked by complaining about people only using on group of pronouns, if you provided multiple and people find it ""easier"" it is justifiable that they use one of them. I of course have friends that use pronouns like she/them and he/them, but I tend to use she or he more often, and me using they/them for a binary person who doesn't use exclusively those pronouns is me speaking a lot, in which case my brain defaults to gender neutral pronouns. Although keep in mind, I do agree with you, I always make the case that neoprounouns are valid as long as they're pronouns.
Ok so first I feel bad for you and the hate you got personally I don't understand using pronouns outside of he/him she/her and they/them because of my understanding but you made some points that did help pronouns are based upon on how you feel and I didn't think about that specific detail emotions are complicated so of course pronouns can be too. I usually try my best to respect people's pronouns because I'm trans mtf and I want mine to be respected I used to feel weird about they/them only because of the English language they/them is plural but as a pronoun it's singular but now I'm used to using they/them as a pronoun so it doesn't feel weird anymore I've even used it in reference to a friend I didn't want to reveal had told me they might also be trans but didn't want to refer to as he/him since that's what most people would think they are because I thought it was non-binary until you said you didn't like they/them because you're non-binary I don't understand it/it's tho could you explain that one please I'm following the same logic as your sister calling you an it/it's sounds kinda disrespectful but based on the post I don't think you see it/it's as referring to something that's anything less than being a human being so can you explain to me why you see they/them as non-binary but not it/it's. I'm still new to neopronouns as well I understand there's a bunch but I don't understand what they all mean or represent, is there anything you could tell me about those as well? Also sorry if any of these comes off as offensive it's not supposed to.

Edit:After reading the comments I think I understand the reasoning behind other pronoun usage, so my question is what do you feel like the differences in it/it's and they/them is as well as the issue of they/them isn't non-binary like I thought and more information on neopronouns.
If you think he/she/they are the only pronouns people can go by I automatically hate you, and I almost can't hate people.
Pronouns probably should be treated as an attribute similar to one’s name; at first you can struggle to remember them but eventually they should stick. We (we are plural, so our pronouns tend to be dependent on whether you are referencing the group or a member) feel like this mindset is necessary to negate the argument of having “too many pronouns”.

I'm terrified to meet someone who uses neopronounes, because I WILL mess up and someone is going to get accidentally hurt
How does one pronounce ""zhe/zhim""?
Neopronouns aren’t for me, but I would still show the same respect for someone who uses neopronouns. It’s really not that hard to understand
How do you pronounce your pronouns? I’ve never met someone who uses zhe/zhim and I’ve never heard them used and I’m curious. Is the h silent or is it like a sh sound with a zzz added? I feel very dumb for asking this and I swear it comes from a place of the deepest and purest love💛🤍💜🖤 I’ve thought about using neopronouns because people would lose the “but they/them is confusing because I’m used to it being pluralllll” excuse and they could either use the neopronoun or admit their transphobia, but I have a feeling I’d be disappointed in the amount of people who would just drop the caring-but-incompetent act and admit their transphobia.

(Edit: spelling mistake fixed: if to I’d)
One thing I’ve learned is that people don’t usually bother to mix up the pronouns they use for you if you use more then one I use She/He/They and well some people will just pick one and stick with it cause our brains are looking for the quickest route possible memory wise it doesn’t want to think too hard. Some of my friends will mix it up from time to time but people in general are just lazy really and that took me awhile to realize
I don’t personally use neopronouns, but I also fall under the gender-fluid umbrella. I personally like they and it because both can be used for anyone, and they cover the fact that no matter what my gender is, I am me. A person. So I understand why people like neopronouns or feel better using them because sometimes there isn’t one that feels like it’s truly you.

I’m sorry you have to deal with this, and while I know that I personally don’t have to deal with it to the level you do, I understand. You are valid and you are perfect as who you are, and nobody can take that away from you.

And to the people in the comments being assholes,consider how zhe feels. Imagine what it feels like to be misgendered and remember that even if you don’t understand, it costs nothing to be a good person to zhim or anyone else.
I used to think neopronouns were confusing and to be entirely honest, I wasn't sure whether it was real (hypocritical, coming from me- a trans man, I know)

Since then, I've met two other people who go by neopronouns and I actually feel more disgusted by the hate than I could ever feel at the people that use them. I'm greatly disappointed in myself, and I hope the people who have been saying these things to you will end up feeling guilty for causing you harm and come to an understanding of who you actually are.

You're a wonderful person, and just because your pronouns are different doesn't mean you deserve all those comments and backlash. I'm sorry this community isn't as accepting as it should be.

Honestly, I don't really understand a lot of neopronouns (specifically noun-self ones) but I'm still going to use them for people if they want me to. I don't have to understand to be respectful (but I am still trying to learn, I want to understand). Also, it really does suck when you have multiple pronouns and only get called one. Mine are he/it, but I only get called he/him because that's the ""normal"" one. People have multiple pronouns for a reason!
I’m sorry people are so shitty. I don’t understand why people make such a big deal out of it. It’s fine if you don’t understand, you don’t need to understand you just need to be respectful. If you want a friend who will actually respect your pronouns no matter what they are feel free to message me
So I have no problem with neopronouns and definitely try to use them the couple of instances it’s come up but it is tricky. 

I get why he/him and she/her doesn’t work for you but I am curious at why they/them doesn’t? Like you didn’t really explain it (not that you have to) but also why would your “friend” default to he/him, when an acceptable (in their mind) analog would be they/them and it seems like it might offend you less?

I’m sorry you got such shit treatment by a friend, seems like you made a reasonable request from someone that seems like they’d be supportive.
I’m sorry that you have to deal with those kind of people because you don’t use “traditional” pronouns. Your pronouns are valid and people should use them- since that’s what makes you comfortable. Pronouns aren’t supposed to make others comfortable, it’s meant to make the user of those pronouns comfortable. I hope you find a group of people who will respect your pronouns.
Genderfluid AFAB here. Some days, I feel differnt by the hour. Like OP, sometimes I wonder what pronouns actually fit me. I'm still figuring myself out, still trying to learn about the LGBTQ+ community.

I'm also an identical twin. (Twinsie is cis.)

On the one hand, I 100% get the outrage over being misidentified. It's infuriating. People would/do get our *proper nouns* wrong, yes, even on purpose. They know us literally our whole lives and still misidentify us: how??? On the other hand, pronouns have never been personalized in the English language. You need to recognize that you're challenging the function and definition of pronouns, if for nothing else than to manage your own expectations. It's more than just your identifiers, even if that's all it is to you.

Languages change and evolve, and yes, every word is made up, but if we all created our own words and syntactic rules, communication would be impossible. Acceptance of neopronouns will require time, effort, and patience before society feels comfortable with the shift. I'm glad you vented here, but it's gonna be a long road. That's just the reality. As both a twin and genderfluid person, I hope you can find a way to deal with these frustrations in a more positive manner for your own mental well-being. Being misidentified sucks, especially when it's done intentionally. But don't let that anger eat at you. Find creative ways to reinforce your chosen pronouns, be patient and gracious, and consider establishing boundaries about it. At a certain line, Twinsie and refuse to acknowledge the wrong names; it forces the issue when we do that.
Zhe/zhim is the first neo pronoun I ever heard of, before even the idea of using they/them, the main character in my story I was planning (never actually wrote it) immediately became zhe/zhim. Only realised zhe was a self insert years later, a I want to be self insert, the me currently self insert of a young girl who was just a bystander in most of her life was more obvious.
Neopronouns are weird to me and I don’t like using them but if all I have to do to make someone feel comfortable is change what word I say to identify them with then I would absolutely try my best to do that
sorry that people are being shitty in the comments, op. you're right.
I'm terribly sorry this has happened to you. Personally I don't understand neopronouns that well but I will try my best to respect them. I just have a lot of other queer friends so sometimes pronouns are hard for me to remember since I can accidentally get them mixed up. That and I'm worried about pronunciation. So I'm sorry if I get anything wrong, it's just hard to remember sometimes since I'm under lots of stress. I really do hope people respect your preferred pronouns though! No one deserves to be misgendered!
I need to clarify before this that I’m not trans, so I have no right to actually argue about this and if I’m wrong or insulting about anything then I’m happy to learn, but I also personally don’t see why it’s such a big deal? I don’t know anyone in real life who uses neopronouns, but as long as you explain how to use them then it really isn’t that difficult????

The way I see it is that our language is fucking thousands of years old, and the majority of it has changed or become outdated in even just the last few years. People like to stick with he/him she/her they/them, but to others those are outdated as well. I mean we’ve realised gender is so fluid, is it really that hard to understand that the pronouns we created so long ago don’t fit everyone anymore???? Gender isn’t binary, so why would or should our pronouns stop evolving to account for all the different people who are just now able to live as they truly are???? It’s just wild to me why people care sm about a goddamn pronoun I stg

If it’s okay with you, can I ask how to use your pronouns? I’d love to learn :))
Yes, I use she/they (in english, in portuguese I use ela/dela), I respect others people pronouns as I get respected by mine, neo pronouns are ok if it's not in a serious case or matter. It/its is tolerable for me tho. He/him/his, she/her/hers and singular they/them/theirs is way more aceptable... sorry but I'm a bit conservative about it
i totally get you.. i thought i was a trans man but thinking about it, i understand what you mean. i want to use neopronouns that have no pre-existing gender (male, female, nonbinary) attached to them because i want to identify as all… wow.. i deadass just came out to myself in a reddit comment. shits wild lmao
I am so lost
:0 I love your pronouns ive never seen those ones before and i mean i mightve but i dont remember it therefore it didnt happen and this is the first time im seeing them and they are cool 👌
Ppl wanna be victims so bad 😂
Because what the fuck is Zhe , what even does that mean , you just put z infront of the word they saying and expect it to change ,
Frankly no hate towards you or your pronouns but in general i hate how pronouns are such a big thing like Oh no i call a “they” a she. Boom. Chaos. Like wtf i think theres just more relevant and important things in the world to care about but you re mad because i cant remember that you’re a xie.
I have a brain that cant retain information from conversations so i dont care much about what people tell me. 
But its that they make such a big deal of it. 
The universe is huge everyone is a speak, a dot in existence i just have no care for pronouns. 
Ill just address you by your name with respect ofc
[removed]
I mean, I *kinda* understand it/its. I feel uncomfortable when using it for people because I feel like I’m kinda dehumanizing them. But that’s a ME problem
This. I don't really know anyone that uses them personally but I know there are a lot of neopronouns out there that exist. I'm afraid I'll mess them up. It also shames me to admit that I occasionally mess up they/them with my SO too (albeit very very rarely). It makes me feel super crappy everytime it happens.
As long as you genuinenly try and don't make it about your or make condescending comments, you're fine.
[removed]
Why wouldn't being bald matter almost everyone experiences it and nearly everyone feels bad or ashamed because of it. Shouldn't that make it matter? (Sorry if I made this confusing I can be more specific if needed)
Same, I don’t understand them but I also don’t understand marine biology, doesn’t mean I don’t respect marine biologists
right thats where i am
Exactly, i dont see how people don’t see the obvious hypocrisy of hateing neopronouns while being trans themselves.
Like i stg 
“I can’t respect someone because I don’t personally understand their identity. “
Is the only reason transphobes exist anywhere at all. Gaaah/vent
Hell misgendering pops up regardless of pronouns unless you are 100% cis passing. Even then, cis folks get misgendered too on occasion. Intent matters just as much as the words said. If someone is attempting to be respectful I'm not going to hold them to the fire for occasional mistakes.
I think it's ok for them to say it's difficult or express it's weird but only expressing that is ok I don't think it's ok to use it as an excuse sort of like how you'd say something was heavy after putting carrying it it's ok for you to say it's heavy but you shouldn't leave it outside because it's heavy if that makes sense
AAAAA OMG TYSM FOR USING ZHE/ZHIM FOR ME THIS MEANS SO MUCH :'DDDDD
for real, zhey got the response that zhey were venting about. i love this sub but sometimes it sucks. neopronouns arent hard to understand at all. im sorry OP about the comments :/
ikr? even in some of these comments people were being dicks to zhim and invalidating zhim like what’s the need
[deleted]
WTaF??  Cisgender here. I would equate the talk of those other cis ppl to be similar to being called the wrong name because “you didn’t like how weird it sounded”.  Then proceeded to say you’d never talk to to anyone with that name because…[reason] *right to their face.*   Okay, so it’s not a pronoun you’re used to hearing or saying, I get that, but the aversion to using neopronouns is taught or learned.  Either family, social media, news, religion, friends, somewhere that is learned or an aversion to what isn’t readily understood.  Also, many people don’t understand how to use them, what they are, or what they mean. If someone asked me to refer to them in a certain way, use a unique name, using particular pronouns, is married to the Berlin Wall (objectum sexual), or whatever—if I cared about them as a human being, I will do what makes them feel comfortable (within the limits of the law.)
A lot of people use nounbased pronouns somewhat metaphorically. 

I read an article a while back that I’m trying to find again which was written by someone neurodivergent that felt no connection to the binary, neurotypical understanding of gender, and understood nounbased pronouns as a way of expressing their relationship with gender to others. 

Kudos btw for trying to understand. As a disclaimer I’m a binary transman who only uses he/him, and I’m still learning, too. But I know what it’s like when people say, “I respect everyone, but I draw the line at _____.” I know for a fact I am on the other side of that line for so many people and so are a lot of us and I just can’t fathom the lack of empathy it takes to draw the line again for someone else!!

Edit: ofc I don’t know everything about nounbased pronouns so this is only one reason for using them and i am open to anyone else’s experiences or ideas (especially since I’m a binary person)
Ikr, I'll never understand why it's sooo hard for poor mushy brained people who uphold toxic standards as a hobby.
I’ve noticed a lot of people automatically converting Op’s pronouns to (z)they/them
It seems like an accident but op uses zhe/zhim
I just thought I’d point it out because im pretty sure people don’t notice they did that./gen/nm
Imagine he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
People complain about new pronouns, however in the 1800s and before then, we had whole rounds of inventing and trying new pronouns that never stuck around. People just want an easy out I guess, no care for feelings or meanings.
Yeah, it’s really disappointing to see so many people in this thread throwing others under the bus. On a trans subreddit nonetheless.
My main problem with neopronouns is probably that the way i was introduced to it was with that whole dreamsexual/dreamgender stuff where they said their pronouns were ""dream/dreamself"" and I've not been able to take them seriously because of it (although i tried for a friend who used xe/xem to at least not gender them)
[deleted]
It's not really all that different than names. And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' and then when you do, you use their pronouns just like you use their name. 

Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people *won't* know what pronoun to use. If you're still masc looking but prefer she or femme looking and prefer he, those aren't what they will say naturally. 

This is what got me to get completely over my own issues about neo-pronouns: ""I took my phone and opened tinder and started swiping; got a few matches and texted one and then snapped a few times."" 20-30 years ago this sentence would make *no* sense to almost anyone. Yet you know exactly what I mean (even if it is a little bit of a hackneyed sentence). Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.
They’re just words, they’re all made up and none of them are things we say “naturally”, they’re literally all learned, they all have limited contexts and none of them are truly universal. If some people feel its worth it to distinguish themselves with uncommon pronouns who are we to say that’s wrong? Like, you’re right to identify that it will be a challenge for these people to establish their pronouns in the common imagination, but struggle is a part of life and what can we say if someone has decided that it’s a worthwhile struggle for them? 

If we happen to have an emotional reaction to some pronouns, it seems like it’s on us to unpack that and have a confrontation with whatever it is making us uncomfortable rather than digging in our heels and centering our comfort over the desires of those people.*

*I am and will continue to be quite bad at using neopronouns for some time. They have little weight or currency in my frame of reference but I’m willing to work on it and I don’t think they should be delegitimized or invalidated.
The amount of explanation necessary is literally just ""I use Zhe/Zhim"" Those are just words used to refer to someone, there's nothing deep about it. anyone can use he/him, she/her, they/them, or anything regardless of their gender because pronouns are uncorrelated with gender. There certainly are some cultural associations between some pronouns and some genders but not everyone fit within traditional stereotypes/norms and while it cost nothing to respect someone's pronouns, the benefice is immense for the recipient.  
It must feel awful for op to be constantly misgendered like that, and we can \*feel\* through zhims replies how happy zhe is when people use zhims pronouns correctly.
[removed]
It's not hard to use neo-pronouns, and requires very little explanation. It's like learning someone's name or nickname. If you knew 2 people named William and they both went by Will, would you tell the first Bill you meet it's too hard and you'd rather call them Will? English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks. So in the meantime people are gonna come up with new ones and try them out. I think they/them has the most history and likely to be the go to, but language is weird and there's no such thing as ""real words"". Zhe/zhim isn't confusing, and it takes a second to catch on when some one is using it.
I'm not sure if it's worth it, and yeah it definitely is hassle to be like this. No other pronoun fits me better than zhe/zhim tho, and I think it's easier for my friends than me constantly changing pronouns everyday.

And yeah, people outside of my social circle won't know my pronouns, but isn't that normal? Most people don't know a person's pronouns until they become friends or check their bio.

And we're not all going to use neopronouns lol. Saying ""if we all used neopronouns how will we know what to call each other?"" is the same as ""if we're all gay how will we reproduce?"" It's never going to happen, and if it will I think we'd know how to address each other. It'd be like names.
If it wasnt worth the hassle nobody would use them. Also all pronouns are made up so it really doesnt matter much if it's what people want.
You say we can change language, which requires people to use this new way of communicating over time, then you say we shouldn't be asking for people to use our neo pronouns because not enough people use them.

Changes in how we use language starts somewhere and is never widely used or accepted at first. If we just stop using words just because they are new (or that they are hard to relate to your own experiences), language would stop evolving.

It all starts somewhere and takes a lot of time, but telling people to stop asking people to respect their identity and pronouns is anti-progress.
New gender neutral pronouns have been invented throughout history in the English language. If the person you’re speaking to understands how important it is to respect your identity, they’ll figure out how to use your correct pronouns. Zhe is literally out here talking about how many people are saying this stuff to zhim every day so I don’t think you needed to say it. Zhe knows communication is a two way street and zhe has tried a LOT to be conducive to the people around zhim but they refuse to respect any pronouns zhe has tried to bring up
Yes!! I really don't understand the hate for neopronouns like it's not doing you any harm?? Just respect it?? As long as their pronouns aren't offensive like using slurs for pronouns then why not respect it? The hate for neopronouns makes no sense
Oh it's he/him but you replace the h with z. The h is there for aesthetic purposes lol
Oh I asked but I might've missed someone else's, where?
They/Them and Zhe/Zhim are different sets of pronouns, that's pretty much it really.
That’s like asking the difference of she/her and he/him lol what
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

I saw this helpful link above.
You don't sound like you're refusing to use zhim's pronouns though, which is kinda the issue the other people were doing. making mistakes and trying your best to be respectful is what's important.

I don't use neo-pronouns, but my twin brother sometimes has issues using she/her and I understand why, as he's not perfect and is used to me being a ""guy,"" so it takes some learning. Especially so since we live so far apart now.
It’s not binary trans people that are the problem, it’s truscum. I’ve seen non binary people get riled up at different pronouns, it’s horrible.
Sorry you have to deal with that shit. You are who you are and it’s completely valid to express that with your correct pronouns. As someone else said, people use “it” to refer to kids all the time, for example when they say “is it a boy or girl?”

And even if nobody had ever heard the word “it” in their life, you deserve respect, period.
https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/

Some people don’t feel like they/them fits. It may be because those folks don’t identify as specifically non-binary and wish for pronouns that are closer to one side or the other or are not associated with the societal expectations for non-binary people the way they/them is now, or for a million other reasons, or for no reason. It may just not feel right. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around, with new ones being invented, throughout all of recorded history.  

As a trans man, if someone refused to call me “he” and would only use “they” I would be very upset by that. It doesn’t matter to me that “they” is neutral; it doesn’t work for me. If I have told someone to call me “he” and they keep saying “they” then they’re misgendering me. 

Sidenote, many intersex people have binary genders; being intersex has nothing to do with gender. It just means you were born with more ambiguous sex characteristics. Many intersex people may never even know they’re intersex.
Well for you it fits. But for some of those people it doesn’t. That’s really all there is to it, neos make people more comfortable.
Is this in ref to op? I cant tell 😓
Sorry you had to do that. It really sucks that people aren’t willing to try. You deserve respect.
I agree. It sounds like zhe has had so many conversations and tried so hard to be conducive to their feelings and explained zhimself like 400 times so at this point it’s on them to figure it out. OP deserves better.
It's pronounced zee/zim!
Shitstorm is kind of an understatement tbh. I can’t believe I saw this type of bs on a trans subreddit of all places. Like got damn
A gender fluid person doesn’t necessarily feel like all genders all the time. He, she, or they might apply to them some of the time, but always calling them one of them could cause dysphoria. Here’s an idea! Try your best! Just like with learning someone’s new traditional pronouns it’s a learning curve! Its not going to be an instant or easy change but just saying “I find it hard so I’m not gonna try” just isn’t ok.
Yeah lots of very uncalled-for statements and ""opinions"" here. Pretty disgusting for a trans sub, people here should be better.
Exactly! Holy shit some of these people are dumb
[removed]
I think you misunderstand nounself pronouns. They’re not saying they feel like that thing, it’s just that those pronouns they have a connection to. 

Also the excuse of “thats why we aren’t taken seriously” is literally a bigoted argument that started with truscum to invalidate non-op trans people, that was later used to invalidate non-binary people, and is now being used to invalidate a subsection of non-binary people.
[removed]
Do you use that argument when someone changes their name to one you haven't hear before? ""Oh, sorry, it's not in my vocab and sets me on edge so I'm just going to pick a common name for you that is somewhat inline with your gender.""
hey; i think you misunderstand what xenogenders are. no one (at least i hope) is saying their gender is a cat/fairy/cloud. they’re just trying to describe how they experience the abstract concept of gender.
idk why ur bringing up xenogenders when they arent mentioned in the post ??
So OP expresses discomfort for a friend refusing to use the correct pronouns, and you come in trying to DISPROVE the poor fucker's identity?

Get out of here with that performative support bullshit. You can't claim to support somebody the sentence after saying you think it's bullshit.
I'm sorry, I've been (and am on) vacation, and the team in general has been a bit busy lately. We've been trying our best to keep up, but we just saw this post, and I'm cleaning it up as best as possible.
It's creating a different pronoun so ots something more comfortable than he/him for zhim  they don't emotionally like the usual male pronouns and want something that doesn't upset them. I may not totally understand neo pronouns but I can understand that some things upset different people. If I hear someone call me ma'am it makes me upset because I'm not a woman do I feel uncomfortable. They feel this same discomfort for those pronouns and found something that doesn't cause that feeling.
Zhe wants you to use them to refer to zhim like this.
You could have just said the last part my dude - the fact that you went out of your way to post that first half contradicts itself
""I'm not gonna be disrespectful""

""I think it's silly""

Pick one, dick.
yo am I getting downvoted for my pronouns? In r/trans ? Sad
I'm curious, how is it that only one person uses your pronouns when you list she/him? Are you asking for literally she/him/his (i.e. She loves his own homemade bread?) Or is it a typo? (btw, I don't think this is invalid, just hard [and some of the most worthwhile things in life are hard])

(I also literally only have one person who uses ze/zir pronouns for me instead of she/her, probably because I use either ze/zir or she/her and people just tend to stick to ""muscle memory"" when it comes to my pronouns?)
You make a great point, but this post is not really a discussion post about it/its pronouns.
[removed]
the basic thing for the first is that pronouns are a form of gender expression, but that doesn't mean that a given pronoun corresponds to a gender identity (example: I'm agender, but I feel most comfortable with fae/faer or it/its; sometimes she/her but it depends on who you are I suppose :p)

it/its for trans people in particular is from a sourced from reclamation of tactics of dehumanization (often associated with the voidpunk subculture, at least in my brain), but reasons of use could vary a lot (as with other pronouns)
[deleted]
I'm not going to ban but asking to use pronouns other than he/she/they isn't extreme. Refusing to use other's pronouns is pretty extreme.
Yeah, no wonder zhe used it in the message.
[removed]

[removed]
He/him but with a ""z"" in front.
I assume it's he/him but with a ""z"" in front.
Bro that just means you dont support neos
How would you feel if someone just couldn’t tolerate using your pronouns of the day?
Fuck that shit. Why is it intolerable? Why do you get to decide what other peoples geneder is, what makes them comfortable. What based on how they look? We exist as a group because others decided we were intolerable, don’t do the same for eachother as well. That just makes you just as bad as them.
Don't feel bad. I will catch myself using he him pronouns for me. I'm solidly they/she non binary, but it's hard to unpack years or even decades of habit
Whether they “help the progression of the community” doesn’t matter. Trans people don’t help the progression of the gay community, we also encourage regression for people who already don’t respect gay people. That doesn’t mean people should stop being themselves.

In summary, [this image](https://i.redd.it/as3hte9s0xg91.jpg)
Well, I agree it is important, I was just worried people would disagree and say it’s not as big as identity? idk. Though tbh yeah any dysphoria-inducing trait intersects with identity

(to be clear for me it’s a huge fear, I know it will be ok if it happens but it’s just a fear)
I've heard there are many benefits
Respect is the key word. I feel the same on this. I don’t need to understand it to respect it.
Could you explain deeper what you mean by not understanding? It is that you don’t know how they function in a sentence or some other type of lack of understanding?
Check out r/TransTryouts for more gender affirmation!
Question op, how would one pronounce this irl? Is it just  how you would say ze? Or does it have a verbal h? Or  something else?
They said they were non-binary and trans, or under the umbrella, and many people under those umbrellas use neo-pronouns.
not it doesn't have to. I have a friend who uses both she/her and he/him. Isn't a guy, isn't a woman. But absolutely hates being called nonbinary. He's just himself and is simply trans.    
Or literally how OP is talking how zhe is genderfluid and wants a pronoun that fits with all three answers. And especially with how at this point they/them is established as the non-binary pronoun, I get it might feel really off on a day zhe doesn't feel like that.
[removed]
Oh ok! I thought it might have a “sh” sound and that’s what confused me, tysm!
I just woke up and am trying my best to clean it up, sorry about being so late, I'm on vacation in another country. >.<
Dreamsexual (as in about the Minecraft youtuber) was a 4chan psyop, unsurprisingly. 

Dream/dreamself neopronouns (as in linking your experience of gender to the experience of dreaming) was a thing before the Minecraft youtuber.

Again, I recognise that it's a far out concept if you aren't introduced to it lightly, but radical acceptance is a cornerstone of the movement.
>And they/them will almost certainly remain as default 'I don't know their gender/pronouns' 

I didn't think about that. It's true though.

>Another thing to keep in mind about who knows to use your pronouns is that for non-passing trans people (or lots of enby people, etc.) people won't know what pronoun to use.

You're right. Since pronouns are based on gender, it's ""easy"" to misgender someone, or to not know what to use.

>Language advances, especially when we're willing to use it.

My primary language is french and our ""they"" is a new pronoun created for the purpose of having a mixed pronoun (or gender neutral?) which is ""iel"" (mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she)). It's now in the dictionary. They should do the same in other languages I think.
[removed]
Thanks for your explanation. I don't say that's wrong, not at all. I was just genuinely trying to understand because reading op's post, it felt like a lot of work. 

Anyway, if someone would ask me to refer to them with neopronouns, I would do it. I would never refuse  because I want to respect them.
I understand that op feels awful for being misgendered. I don't say that neopronouns shouldn't exist. I just genuinely want to understand, and was wondering if it was worth the efforts op has to put in explaining that. But I better understand that yes, it's worth it.

Also my primary language is french, and we have a mixed pronoun now (or gender neutral?), which is ""iel"" that's a mix between ""il"" (he) and ""elle"" (she). It's a new pronoun, unlike ""they"" in english, that is already used for plural.
>English has been struggling to find a gender neutral pronoun for over a hundred years and I think we're still trying to find one that sticks.

Yeah my primary language is french and a gender neutral pronoun was created and is now in the dictionary: iel (mix between il(he) and Elle(she)).

I struggled with the pros and cons of neopronouns when I came out.  Sure, it isn’t easy for a lot of people (often including the people who use them!), but that doesn’t mean it isn’t worth it.  If it is right for you, it is automatically worth it.

It is so upsetting to me to see other trans people using the same rhetoric that is used by cis people to validate transphobia and misgendering and apply it to people with neopronouns.  “I just think we should follow the rules of science/language”  “It’s just a word, why do you let it define you?”  “That’s too hard for me to remember.”  “I wouldn’t have known unless you told me, so it isn’t fair.”  All of those arguments are fundamentally ridiculous, and they have all also been used for gender non-conforming cis people, binary trans people, non-binary trans people who use they/them.  It’s just queer-/transphobia with the goal of making you feel guilty and responsible for how hard their phobia is for them 😢🙄😬.

I’m sorry this happens to you.  But you are totally valid and worth using the pronouns you want.  Btw if you choose to wear a pronoun pin, people will still ignore it, but they can’t say your pronouns aren’t universally accessible 🙂.

Take care, friend!  💜
Just commenting to say I agree with you and I don’t know why on trans Reddit anybody would be saying it’s unreasonable to be upset at being misgendered. 

Gender neutral pronouns have been around as long as English has and people are constantly inventing more. This is NOT new. 

That argument sounds like the people who call us transtrenders when in reality trans people have been around as long as gender identity has.
[removed]
Yeah! It’s just a word it’s not like it’s a slur it’s just a word!
Huh, I always pronounced them like the 's' in measure, but only in my head. The more you know
Wait then you would pronounce them like he/him?
Sorry I don't speak English natively so I don't understand how would the pronunciation be
Nice
idk, but zhe said it was pronounced like he/him but with a z instead of h
How do you feel comfortable with zhe and not they
Agreed

Omg! That's so cool!
As a mod, I agree. Been doing my best to clean up after seeing it first thing in the morning. Was not expecting to be raised by truscum while on vacation.

Some people do actually identify with those pronouns because they identify as those things. I have a lovely friend who uses xe/xem and voi/void and though I don’t understand what it means to identify as a celestial/void being I do know that xe is wonderful and deserving of the respect of using whichever label voi prefers at the time.

Yeah, xenogenders are literally just metaphors. In fact cis and binary trans people use metaphors regarding their genders all the time, it’s not that different.

I just a meant it was seemed a little strange sorry to offend you
Sorry that’s happening. Your pronouns are valid and you’re valid
Yes it’s literally she/him the full set is she/him/his/herself
[removed]
Thanks for explaining me. I don't believe I still totally get it... but anyway just like before I am no one to decide what pronouns must be or not be used. I want to be refered to as she, if someone wants to be called ""it"" I will use ""it"", for ""they"" people I use ""they"" and so on. It would be very transphobic to do otherwise.
Girl I’m 24. But I am old enough to know that this was not the reality of the queer community at large even 10 years ago. At this point, being able to choose to be queer is annoying and rubs people with no choice but to be queer the wrong way.

Also if you’re so progressive, you wouldn’t shame someone for their age.

Makes sense
Obligatory Context:

https://www.reddit.com/r/tumblr/comments/pgq1tn/there_are_many_benefits_to_being_a_marine/
probably means they can’t relate to wanting to use them?
For me it is like this

I can understand wanting to be more masculine and wanting to go by masculine pronouns, like he/him.

I can understand wanting to be more feminine and wanting to go by feminine pronouns, like she/her.

And i can understand finding yourself outside the gender binary of masc/fem and therefore wanting to go by neutral pronouns like they/them. 

But what i don’t understand is what makes someone want to specifically use pronouns like zhe/zhim? It obviously is supposed to be something outside the binary, but at that point, why not just use they/them? What is it about neopronouns that are more desireable than using the already established gender neutral pronouns? I get that they are more comfortable, but i don’t understand why. Like for me as a trans-femme, i like using she/her because it appeals to my feminine identity and my desire to be a woman, but i don’t understand what is it that drives NBs who use neopros to use them rather than they/them. Like if you wanted to be outside the binary, surely you would just use the nonbinary pronouns that already exist. 

I would also like to add, i’m not trying to sound like i’m wanting to not use neopronouns, if that’s what you want to go by, that is what i will try to use. I’m just trying to gain an understanding on why you want to use those specifically, and voicing my lack of understanding so i can hopefully be enlightened.
I assume like the french j, or the s in vision :)

The line thing? Super fair. 

I’ve only lived in the US so I can’t compare with anywhere else, but “All people deserve respect (as long as they’re exactly like me and I understand them)” is pretty much the foundation of this country lmao
Honestly no need to apologize. It’s not you’re fault that people are… the way they are.
[removed]
That’s all that a neopronoun is…a gender neutral pronoun that has recently been added to the language.  I’m glad that “iel” is being used!  When I learned French years ago, it didn’t exist, so that’s great 😄
One of the advantages French and Swedish have in this regard is that those languages are dictated by a group. English doesn't have anything group that updates the language so it all has to be done organically over time. On one hand I think it's really cool that we have this explosion of interesting pronouns, and have for a long time, but it's harder for these things to hit the mainstream. I use they/them and even that has caused some discussion, and those have been around since old English!
Yeah. This thread is garbage, I'm cleaning it up.
What WILL be enough then? Zhe/zhim and other neopronouns are already being used by many people, meaning they do have value to multiple people. According to your criteria, they're worthy of being added to the language.

And why, in a trans sub, would anyone be calling not wanting to be misgendered ""demanding compliance""? It's a simple pronoun, not a dictator's new laws being enacted
Words help frame our perceptions and understandings of the world. People often react poorly to feeling like those frameworks are being challenged or that their understanding is imperfect. It’s not good but it is and I think people would do well to reflect on what exactly they’re protecting: Their actual safety or just a feeling of safety.
Pronounced ""zee"" ""zim""
No you replace the h sound with z
Oh that makes so much more sense!
Personally? I don't use Zhe, but to me it'd be because they/them either:

1. Doesn't describe my experience as a trans person.

2. Gets confused for plurality.

3. Isn't something that makes me comfortable.
Okay yeah based
[removed]
Xenogenders don’t mean they identify as that thing though. Xenogenders are literally just metaphors. Nounself neopronouns aren’t always connected to xenogenders either. 

Xenogenders and neopronouns are valid but it’s incorrect to say things like “someone who is catgender identifies as a cat” because that incorrectly represents xenogenders. Otherkin would be identifying as said thing, like identifying as a cat. They could also use nounself neos if they wanted.
Ok then, be bigoted if you want. Throwing your own community under the bus does nothing but make you a bigger target faster.
I know people who use multiple names. Every heard of nicknames? It's not hard.

Also, using that name as your choice is pretty mocking. So I don't think you get my point.
[removed]
[removed]
“I think it’s kinda silly” why the fuck was it necessary to say that?? That is actively disrespectful to anyone who uses neopronouns. It would’ve been SO easy not to say that
Ie we should not ever say he for you, only she, but also never her, just him?
You absolutely don't need to apologize, however a vent post really isn't the place to discuss the validity of using the ""it"" pronoun. You're absolutely entitled to never use that pronoun for people if it's this painful <3
Person. Calm down, you’re the one who said “they/them/theirs is easy considering we already use them but ze/zhim/…zeirs??”. Replace the “they/them/theirs” with “she/her/hers” or “he/him/his” and “ze/zhim/zeirs” with “they/them/theirs”. It’s the same argument people were making a few years ago against non-binary people. And idk how the heck being a white queer person matters in this case, as a trans POC, I don’t see it mattering at all. And calling the person transphobic was uncalled for… especially when they’re defending OP and other neo users, and are trans themself. Take a breath and consider things again.
Wow that is a lot of assumptions. I don’t show up to marches cause my parents would quite literally kill me if they found out. And also, how in the fuck did you misunderstand my comment that badly?

There are so many LGB people who say they deserve rights, but trans people don’t. There are so many binary trans people who say they deserve rights, but non binary people don’t. There are so many non binary people who say they deserve rights, but neopronoun users don’t. My point is that all of these are equally stupid - people will make fun of the LGBT community no matter what, infighting and saying that *some* LGBT people are invalid will never be helpful.
I’m sorry you’ve had shitty experiences with white people, but you shouldn’t generalise because that’s the exact same thing transphobes are doing. If it helps I’m white and go to marches, I stick up for everyone who’s oppressed, of course that doesn’t fix anything but you really shouldn’t generalise, and you’re also being racist which isn’t helping anything
Did I pick the one profession with a massive tumblr thread by accident?
Tbh, that's my assumption. 

I get they/them.  I even quite like she/they.

I have no idea why anyone would want to be called zie/zem or whatever else exists.  
I have no idea why some people who use she/they need to get both of em.  
I don't need to.

It's yet another opportunity to practice 'respect without understanding'.
Not sure what the downvote is for when I’m asking a clarifying question to better understand the speaker to be able to better engage with the speaker. 

If we could understand the lack of understanding, we could address it. Alas, relating and understanding are two different things.
it's for the exact same reason that you use she/her. that's literally the exact reason. because it's what feels correct and affirming and Good. 

there are also binary trans people and cis people who use neopronouns. it's not just nonbinary people, just like there are cis men who use she/her and cis women who use he/him. 

but no, it's literally the same reason why anyone uses any pronoun that they use. because it feels right and comfortable. sometimes that means inventing something new. i had to do that for my gender identity, some people have to use that for pronouns.
This is like my viewpoint exactly
Identity shouldn’t have to be about progression. I’m not trans to be some kind of force for progress, just because it’s what feels right for me and it’s wrong to place that burden on other trans people too.
Yeah, but sucks that there was so much garbage here that I only just saw. Trying to keep a safe space isn't easy, but, y'know, it's important to me that I try.
[removed]
I think it was added last year in the dictionary.
Oh okay, i was more confused about the z sound than the ""ee"", but apparently there's only one z sound in English, like in zoo.
Somehow i though there was other variant but messed up with Spanish z which is pronunced like th im think.
So yeah I was confused of it should be pronunced like zee or like ""thee"" my bad.
Btw as a Spanish speaker, its so hard for us to pronunce differently ""she"" and ""ze"". We only have one sound for that so :(
[removed]
I don’t know why you are explaining xenogenders to me. I was talking about a specific being that uses voi/void as a set of pronouns which voi include with other neopronouns when self labelling. Voi is plural and does not identify as human and collectively choose to identify as a celestial body/void being. Edit to apologize if this seems combative, I appreciate the clarification you are making and I am sure in most instances nounself pronouns are not about being the thing but about associating with aspects of it, however in the specific case I was talking about the being explicitly identifies as being a void being.
[removed]
hi!!! you just replied to a post where OP is using zhis pronouns in real life! so it would be wrong to categorize zhim as “terminally online” ! 

spreading neopronoun hate on a post venting about neopronoun hate is wild
Please don't invite raids from them by linking their sub here <3
Correct
I talked with a friend about it and they said the same thing. 

I still feel horrible for not being able to, like I'm invalidating anyone who feels most comfortable with those neopronouns.
[removed]
Nah, you probably chose it for the benefits
Definitely respect regardless of understanding but it’s also worth attempting to understand. As a binary trans man, I would prefer that people at least try to understand who I am and genuinely see me as a man instead of only changing the words they use. Here’s an article about neopronouns which may help https://www.lgbtqnation.com/2022/01/everything-need-know-neopronouns/
That's a good way to view it personally I like to try and understand why also makes it easier to respect but I don't need to understand or be able to relate to respect it
I think the downvote is because the asking if it’s struggling to understand how they work in a sentence comes across as condescending because it’s pretty obvious that they work exactly like any other pronoun. It didn’t seem genuine; it seemed like a jibe.
I haven’t downvoted you, that’d be other people
Yeah, but i don’t understand why they make you feel affirming and good. For me what is affirming and good about feminine pronouns are that they make me feel like a woman. That is the understanding i’m after, why they make you feel good.
Mind if I ask what you invented? I'm curious
[removed]
Oui, dans Le Robert il me semble. Je suis contente qu'on ai plus d'options neutres en français; d'autant plus que récemment un.e de mes adelphe as fait son coming out comme étant genderfluid. (iel préfère être référé.e en langage non-genré pour l'instant)
Well, I wouldn't use he or him for example as I don't identify myself with those pronouns, and they don't describe my experience in transition.
Yes in specific cases it’s different, but even in my initial comment I was talking about in general to a person who was confusing two things and also calling neopronouns ridiculous.
[removed]
It’s honestly genuine curiosity. But I can see how one could read it that way.
because they make them feel like their gender? op's pronouns feel good because those pronouns are affirming for zhem, it makes zhem feel like zheir gender, and that's all there is to it. it's literally no different than a binary person using he/him or she/her. i don't see why that's hard to understand lmao?

&#x200B;

edit: blocked because apparently i'm being 'rude' lmao. not responding further to this thread lol
Basically I couldn't find a label that felt like it fit with my spiritual beliefs and how that relates to my gender, so I've been using post-human (the term itself was penned by my favorite musician, actually). It's kind of a disregard towards the human notion of gender and moving past that while also moving somewhat backwards in experiencing gender the way a non-human animal might; that is to say Not Really Experiencing it.

Of course with most people I just say I'm a nonbinary trans man because it's easier to say that as shorthand (and believable since I use he/him) than explaining how my werejaguar and naturism beliefs influence my interaction with gender and presentation and all that 😂 

So yeah. Post-human, and I kind of use that for sexuality, too. I just don't ascribe to any of the general human approaches to it. I am what I am, and that's not as important as what I do.
Oui c'est dans le Robert! Pour une langue particulièrement genrée, je trouve ça même surprenant haha

[removed]
I didn't entirely understand all of that but I get what you mean  I haven't had much interest in determining my sexuality or where I truly sit on that umbrella or some of the others
I'm not sure what you don't understand tbh
[removed]
I’m falling into the same boat with you with not really being able to conceptualize why someone would feel affirmed with neopronouns. Like cloudself and whatnot is very confusing to me and I’d love to understand them, but anytime you ask someone for an in-depth explanation it seems like all that’s given back is exactly what this other commenter gave. Something vague that’s not very helpful for conceptualizing
[removed]
I feel like there's a precedent set with a gendered set of pronouns or a specifically non-gendered set but with neopronouns there's no basis for those on the outside of the neo pronoun user to understand how that pronoun relates to your gender and how zhey'd like to be perceived. Not that that contributes or detracts to it's validity but it certainly adds a layer of confusion that often leads to the good old human reaction of just giving up.
I think it's like how I don't feel like or really even identify as a human I call myself an alien because of the way most of mankind is I don't use it as my pronouns now imagine if you didn't know what an alien was but still felt that way. Neopronouns are the alien which haven't been named basically I think.
That's not what I said, but transition is a process in which you learn to express yourself, pronouns are one such way to do so.
[removed]
Yourself.

Because I don't know what answers you're expecting. You're expressing who you are, how you see yourself, the way you want to see yourself in society.

I'm not entirely sure what you were trying to learn lol, you should be a bit more clear on what you're asking and why I guess, it seems trolly to ask things the way you did.

Well gender identity in and of itself is a complicated matter. Some of it is based in biology, some of it based on social identity, some of it based on your upbringing, etc.

Pronouns themselves are interesting because using non-standard pronouns, especially ones that are not in the usual lexicon, can be a way to express yourself in a way that you otherwise couldn't. For example, he/him typically mean masculine, she/her typically mean feminine, and they/them can mean lack of gender or something else to the effect of gender non-conforming.  
Neo-pronouns themselves imply that your gender identity is a known quantity, but one that isn't defined by the use of one of the above pronouns. Now, I don't personally use neo-pronouns myself, but I can understand why they're used; as for me using she/her (or even they/them depending on how I feel) allows me to express my inner gender identity in a way that makes me feel comfortable when I'm referred to using them, that people respect who I am and it reinforces how I feel on the inside.

I won't say that that's true for _everyone_, but it does give an overview of how I personally feel about them. To give a brief overview from before, the use of the pronouns (as an example with she/her over they/them):

1. Describe my experience as a trans person.
  - As in they describe my gender identity in a way that makes sense as to how I identify.
2. Doesn't get confused for some other meaning of my gender identity
  - As in they couldn't be mistaken for plurality, or something else that they/them would indicate that she/her doesn't.
3. These pronouns make me comfortable as who I am.
  - As in I know I'm respected in the gender identity that I am, that people aren't making some sort of assumption or otherwise don't think I'm someone that I'm not.
[removed]
That's a hard question to answer without a lot of time and investment honestly. I'll give a relatively short and overly simplified rundown though:

> how exactly do you define gender/gender identity?

(I consider gender to be gender identity in this context, as it makes it easier)  
Gender identity is an internal sense of self and that's self connection to the reality it perceives around it.

> could you explain how it links to social identity, biology, and upbringing?

I'll preface this by saying that I don't think any one of these 3 things are more important than the other, nor do I think that they're the only things that effect or link to gender identity, nor do I think that these 3 things are prerequisites to be transgender.

- The links to social identity is kinda obvious if you understand what I say in my definition above, but to expand upon it; the way you see and understand yourself, the role you place yourself in society, the role society places you, the places/people/institutions that you identify with, etc. are all ways that it links to a social identity.
- As for biological links, it's hard for me to say directly, as I mostly just listen to those that are smarter than I am, since biology is incredibly complicated! We still don't understand exactly why trans people exist, but if we try to think of how the body is an extension of the self, and gives us the ability to interact and perceive the world in a way that's impossible for the brain to do alone, then it gives us some hints as to what it could mean. Since our sense of self may conflict with the body we perceive ourselves to have, and the hormones and whatnot that effect it, that could be one way biology links to gender identity, though absolutely not the only way.
- Upbringing is interesting, as it's another way to say socialization, as in how we grow up seeing ourselves through the people and institutions that raised us. This can mean that we see ourselves in ways that are detrimental to our own mental health, or in ways that give a unique perspective on the world around us. Our gender identity would then be shaped by not only how we see ourselves through those that raise us, but also through ways we didn't see ourselves through those same people/institutions.

I hope that explains a bit of what I mean, but you could philosophize on and on about links to gender identity, how they work, what they mean, etc. etc. etc. It's a fun thing to think about, but also a bit tiring lol 😅"	xarfae	trans	1539	0.86	2022-09-10 14:58:20
My dad outed me in front of the entire staff of a dealership yesterday.	"So I've been transitioning for a little over a year now (MTF) I actually hit my 1 year Milestone a few days ago on September 3rd. I've gotten to the point where I can pass as woman fairly often, which is what I was really worried about. 

The other day I met up with my Dad to go look for my first car, an it will be the first time meeting with him since came out to him about 4 months ago, and he was generally pretty accepting based on his texts, which was a huge relief.

Needless to say after a year of HRT, self betterment, and some voice training, my appearance and voice are drastically different. I prettied myself up as best as I could, and we set off.

Even then, he ended up dead naming me and misgendering me the entire day. I very politely asked for him to use my new name, and refer to me as she/Her, otherwise people wouldn't know who he was talking about. He didn't say anything.

As my girlfriend and I are taking a look at a car together, he hollers, ""Hey, Deadname!"" at the top of his lungs to get my attention. I looked over and he was talking to a salesman, who saw me come over and looked visibly confused. 

I tried to just ignore it and hope the staff would think he was just senile. But he continued calling me by my deadname and old pronouns once we were inside, in front of the ENTIRE STAFF. I am wearing a form-fitted shirt with B-Cups, skinny jeans, and long, curly hair. It was just so uncomfortable sitting there listening to him refer to me as 'his son' over and over again. It got to the point where a salesman stopped mid conversation to ask me how I would like to be referred to as, since what my dad was saying and how I looked didn't line up. 

I was thankful he asked, but I wish he didn't have to. He actually gendered me correctly the first time he saw me, and called me 'Miss.' 

I don't know how to feel. Yesterday was just extremely frustrating. I don't know how to confront him about it without coming off as an a-hole about it. I'm just not sure what to do about him.

Rant over, thanks for reading."	"Text him and tell him it was absolutely unacceptable behaviour, and if he does it again, you'll have to seriously consider your relationship. No room for counter arguments. No one can dictate what is acceptable for you apart from yourself.
Sorry to hear about this. Unfortunately, I can’t even suggest a path with your father. But when I read the part about the salesperson asking you how to refer to you, that made me feel happy for you, and happy that there are people out there that care enough.

My thought is that the workers at the dealership probably thought worse of your father than of you.
Your dad is a jerk.  If my dad did that to me, our relationship would be over.
I think I see what's going on here. He only wants to be supportive in private. Like he's worried it will be embarrassing to him, somehow, if he genders you appropriately in public. It's transphobia of a more selfish kind. Talk to him about it, if he isn't respecting you in public then he isn't respecting you at all. Maybe this experience of embarrassing himself by being transphobic has or will open his eyes more.
This is exactly why my dad and I don't speak anymore. I told him this isn't a matter of his ""acceptance."" It is a matter of respect. I told him to take all the time he needs to learn to show me some respect.

He hasn't talked to me since. That's his loss. I'm adorable.

And so are you. It's okay to stand up for yourself!
Sounds like your dad made an ass of himself
It’s sad that the car dealer had to stick up for you because your own father wouldn’t be respectful. I’m so sorry.
The salesman pointed out to your dad he was being a jerk. The salesman didn't say anything directly, but the salesman's  behavior made it clear, or at least should have. Next time you see your dad or this comes up, say "" Gee Dad. I hope that salesman didn't embarass you when he corrected your error and called me miss"". This says you weren't embarrassed, but he should be because the salesman, without prompting, understood you and by example, showed your dad how to behave.
My heart breaks for you having to go through this. What an awful situation to be in.
I advise talking to him openly if possible. My parents were the same and they still misgender and deadname me and it’s been 6 months since I came out to them and I’ve seen them more than just the once
I know that you don't want to come off as an ahole, but 1) setting and enforcing boundaries doesn't make you an ahole, and 2) maybe you just need to be an ahole, considering your dad has no problem being one. Tell him that if he can't even make an effort to do the bare minimum, you aren't gonna make an effort to have him in your life. Seriously, what he's doing could get you hurt or killed.
Firstly, props to that salesperson who asked, that’s the correct thing for them to have done given what was happening. Secondly, if my family ever did anything like this to me, they would never see or hear from me again. I gave them four months after I came out to figure it out, and after that I stopped putting up with their f**kups. They continued misgendering me, and so I got them all on a video call (I live 2,500 miles away from them) and to paraphrase said “call me by my name. Call me by my pronouns. Screw up again and there will be consequences.” And sure enough, the next day I called, and they immediately screwed it up. So I blocked all their numbers, and didn’t tell them my new address when I moved to a new city a few months later. After seven or eight months I reached out, and they apologized for being insensitive, and haven’t messed up since. Don’t compromise on your boundaries for anyone. No one is worth it.
Dear Father

What happened at the car dealership yesterday was unacceptable. The constant use of my dead name and old pronouns was not only disrespectful but could potential be dangerous or even fatal were the wrong person to hear. It *cannot* happen again. If it does I can no longer trust you in public and therefore can no longer be seen with you in public. I would also have to reconsider my willingness to associate with you in private.

Your Daughter

If he does it again, cut him off.
“Hey dad. Shut up. You’re royally fucking this up and I don’t appreciate your lack of effort. Do better. I’m disappointed in you.”
So sorry you are dealing with this. Congratulations on your transition and I am glad someone treated you with respect. Here are my tips for this situation:

There’s this site called the Pronoun Dressing Room and you can fill in your name and pronouns and it will give you this link you can share with whoever. The link will take them to that page where they can read stories with your name and pronouns, as a way to practice and get used to it in their head. You/they can also play around with different pronouns you want to practice. 
I used the site like once a week when I first transitioned to practice my own new name/pronouns. I recommend reading through it like once or twice a week until they become easier to use. It’s one of my favorite resources. 

[Pronoun Dressing Room](http://www.pronouns.failedslacker.com/?fbclid=IwAR3Vzgar4LGy5FkBpVOgJR8k00AlBj67_r7xiNaGKkRUuK_BmVNfL7Ge3F4)

Also, I strongly recommend finding a good book/website/video for parents of transgender adults. That way the book/website/video does a LOT of the emotional and mental labor involved with educating, deconstructing, re-educating, etc.  It is so much easier on everyone if you are not trying to do all of that yourself. 

If he refuses to listen, change his behavior, and/or respect your boundaries then do whatever you need to do to protect yourself. Explain that his behavior is not just disrespectful but dangerous. You were lucky in your situation the people were not extremists, transphobes, or some other type of person who threatens our existence, or might discriminate against trans people. Maybe only see him in controlled situations, where he can’t out you, and with people who will help you correct him. Establish that once he can address you correctly, then you can try social situations again. 

Hope it gets better. Virtual mom hug.
Punch ur dad in the face
Your dad clearly has some unresolved issues with your transition, and he should not be working them out on you. He should speak to a therapist about how best to come to terms with his feelings and maybe even learn how to make his brain automatically spit the correct name/pronouns out of his mouth. 

The other possibility is, if he says he wants to be supportive and generally tries to be in private, and I hate to say this, but cognitive declines are real as we get older. My dad died of a brain tumor and I think he had it for a long time before it was ever diagnosed. It changed him in ways that are difficult to talk about or even be sure what was him vs what was the tumor. But I think in the end a lot of it wasn't even him, it was cancer. When I was 19 I don't think I was even speaking to my dad at all, it was a very difficult relationship. I recommend as much patience and grace in dealing with him as you can possibly muster. Don't let him hurt you. He is not entitled to harm you physically or mentally.

Re-write this post as a letter to your dad. Whether you give it to him or read it to him or just try to have a conversation about it in the future, it will help you organize your thoughts so you can hit the talking points that you want to address with him. And get it all out.
If you want ppl to think he’s senile genuinely gaslight him. Like as horrible as that sounds your safety is in jeopardy when he does that. First thing that came to mind was that who he was calling for was your dead twin and he hasn’t been the same since he passed. (Rip fake twin) make a big show about it. Just as big as his. I’m really sorry he does this and doesn’t understand how it causes harm.
When parents humiliate their children, it’s an attempt to assert dominance and control. In the case of trans youth, their child has made a decision and exercises autonomy. The parent sees this as a loss of control that they’ve always asserted to that point.

I feel for you. Some parents lift their kids up and want them to be independent. Others treat them like pets or worse.

Parents of trans kids need to get the fucking message: it’s support, or see ya. Give them time to adapt, but don’t let them cross the line from mistake to humiliation. Because it will not stop with one time.

Some may not be able to be this assertive under their parents roof.

When I was a teen, I got my work situation sorted. When my father asked me to pay rent, I said sure. But that the household chores I’d been doing most of were going to change. He said no. I was gone 7 days later. I never spoke to him again until he died 35 years later.

It wasn’t about rent and chores. It was my long memory of a lifetime of collective shitty behaviour.
Your dad pretty clearly was doing it on purpose and I think you either need to find a way to really get through to him or (at least temporarily) cut him off if possible.
So sorry you had to go through that.  Why the hell can total strangers be more perceptive, accepting and supportive than family members?  Sounds like your dad’s kinda clueless.
""Dad, I have B-cups and skinny jeans. Everyone knows I'm a woman. The staff thinks you have dementia.""
I would absolutely treat your dad like he's senile. ""Dad, you're getting confused again. I'm not Deadname, I'm Juniper. Do you remember where we are? (to the salesman) sorry about him *apologetic look*""
if my dad did this it wouldn’t talk to him again.
That was not an accident on your dad's part. Sorry it happened to you. Glad the dealership treated you nice.
Happy one year first and foremost! 

Sorry to hear dad is struggling so hard to accept you. I gave up on my dad because he was doing the same thing and would not adjust. Hopefully your pops realizes how disrespectful his actions are, and maybe that could be a good way to frame things for him to understand.
To be honest with you, you should prepare yourself to cut him completely out of your life. My mother has done the same thing to me, and when talking to my children over the phone continues to mis gender me. I haven’t spoken with her directly in almost 3 months because of it, and I am almost at the point where I will cut her off completely due to her refusal to accept the true me. I understand how frustrating it can be to consider, and how scary it can be to completely follow through, but you need to do what is best for yourself.
Your dad is a poopy butthole and he poops his pants on the regular.
i’m happy that you still have your father in your life, not many of us do, but it’s worth considering if he is worth continuing to have in your life. that is BEYOND mortifying, the fact that a salesman had more empathy than your father speaks volumes about the respect he has for you. 

it’s okay to take a step back from this relationship. tell him why you don’t feel like coming around anymore. be firm and stand your ground.
Don’t worry about coming off as an a-hole in front of an a-hole. Gl girl ❤️❤️
be as angry as you want, if anything you're the one with a right to be angry/annoyed about it, not him.
Your dad is an a-hole.
Your dad sucks. Solidarity.
I am really sorry this happened.  
After a year there is no excuse and it really sounds like he isn't trying.  
I've recently just stopped talking to and seeing my dad. He was better than this but constantly said hurtful things to me.  
Sometimes cutting contact is better for our mental health.  
My dad knows I am not speaking to him and why, and yet has made no attempt to fix the relationship.

I think taking a hardline approach is the only way with some people... especially a lot of men... they just don't get nuances and aren't very good at ""feelings"" I find...  


Good luck to you sis. Glad you are able to pass as well, that's such an awesome milestone! 😊😊
I am so sorry. Based on your comments it sounds like this was deliberate and spiteful. Please do yourself a favor and cut off contact with him until he starts respecting you. You deserve better and it seems like you're not dependent upon him. Cutting contact doesn't have to be forever and if you tell him why then he'll have as much time to think about his mistake as you're willing to give him.
Huh my 1 year milestone was also September 3rd
I'm really sorry you went through this, that's absolutely unacceptable. Here's what I just don't get; I swear people who think that way are just hellbent on making a statement by deadnaming or using the wrong pronouns. It really can't be anything else except for satisfying their need to express their opinion. Like honestly, imagine someone just changes their name for marital reasons or personal reasons, I bet you 100% they wouldn't have a problem using the ""new"" name at all, the only reason they don't do this is because we're trans.
I just bought a car with my dad Saturday and literally went through the same thing but he doesn’t accept me as a male so he just doesnt care. I’ve been on T for a year and a month now and definitely have some changes to my appearance. I haven’t shaved my legs since i was 14 and I’m 23 now, he continuously says “why don’t you shave your legs” in front of the salesman as were waiting on paperwork. I was so embarrassed and I literally wanted to just leave and die in a hole somewhere.
That salesman is the GOAT
Maybe bring up the level of danger that behavior could have put you in when you talk to him.
My dad does pretty much the same … I started ignoring him when he uses my deadname. There’s nobody with that name here. I’d rather be dealing with him being annoyed at not being Heard- than submitting to his deadnaming
hello fellow juniper, im so sorry this happened. it’s literal bullshit. like completely unacceptable. im just a mere redditor who has no context of you and your fathers relationship outside of what you’ve said here, but based on what i’ve read here and in your other posts, you’re gonna need to have a serious talk with him regarding the future of your relationship. 

if necessary, you might need to limit your contact with him, your mental health comes first and if he doesn’t want to accept you, that’s his loss. 

you sound like a beautiful woman and im really happy your transition is going well :)
I haven’t spoken with my father in two years and my mother for a year. They were complete trash about my transition. Once I decided that I was better off without them, I moved on with my life. 

I have 5 kids and two step kids and I can’t imagine treating any of them the way they treated their only child. 

I’m so sorry this happened to you. I wish parents could just be more accepting of the fact that at some point, your life is yours to take charge of instead of continuing to try to make you do what they want.
*hugs you* that's rough I'd try to say something better but I'm tired and crashing now so I will give a better response tomorrow
It’s prolly just cuz he’s a boomer and isn’t used to your new name and pronouns yet
honestly, text your dad and tell him that if he doesn't start trying to use your correct name and pronouns, then you'll have to minimise contact with him. he knew what he was doing, there. he needs to choose between you and his (nonexistent) son.
After 5 years of this bullshit I've just decided that they're never going to get it and they've never been positive or supportive people in my life anyway so I'm moving on with my life and having minimal contact with them.  I guess it will depend on your situation but it's a total lack of respect and I wouldn't put yourself in that situation anymore.
I’d have an actual sit down with him. Text and phone calls aren’t any good. You need to be looking at him. This is who you are. If he still wants to have his child in his life, he needs to accept that.
Agreed with the hard line approach. I would suggest OP do it in a non-accusatory way. 

Something like “the way you were constantly dread naming and misgendering me in public cannot happen again. Accidental or not, it cannot happen. Not only does this attract unwanted and unnecessary attention to me, it’s potentially dangerous if the wrong person hears it. I understand slip ups happen sometimes. But if you can’t make a genuine effort to make sure what happen that day never ever happens again, I won’t be able to be out in public with you anymore.”

In case it’s not obvious, this is deliberately a test of support. There’s no direct accusation at them, so if they get mad, defensive, or dig in their heels they are showing they aren’t actually supportive. Anything short of “sorry, I’ll make sure it doesn’t happen again.” Should be met with extreme skepticism.
This isn’t an issue for text messages. It’s a hard face to face discussion. Simple, short. Different generation.

It was an attempt to control and humiliate. When you’re ready, do a one on one sit down.

1. The car dealership incident was an attempt to control and humiliate.

2. Why?

He will deny it and backpedal, deflect, accuse. Stay quiet and listen until he stops. Stay on topic and don’t take bait.

When he’s done, ask him a question. “What happens now?”

“What kind of relationship do you want between us? This year? Five years from now? Ten years from now?”

Questions, listening. It disarms them as they expect confrontation and aggression. And they aren’t thinking about the long term. Get them thinking about it. Think long and hard about what the future looks like. Because you control the long term, not him.
Probably, yeah. Even after the salesperson asked what I would like to be called, my dad still continued to use my deadname and such. I seriously don't understand why he thought it was appropriate.
Yeah the dealership employees were likely very uncomfortable.  They’re there to get sales and anyone with any sense is going to recognize that misgendering a trans person (or anyone, really) likely means a lost sale.
This. He knew what he was doing.
He did it in private as well. My girlfriend had to butt in and correct him on my name, which he made a big deal out of and let out a huge sigh. Not a great sign.
This is a good idea. It embarrasses your father (if not nearly as much as he embarrassed you!), and keeps you safe in possibly dodgy situations.
Jesus, that's awful, I'm so sorry that happened to you.

My dad is definitely the controlling kind of person, who took all my earnings for himself and made it seem like I was being selfish when I didn't, as he didn't have a job during that time. That's why I left his sorry ass years ago. He never apologized for and made me feel like I was betraying him.

So yeah, I completely understand how you feel. A complete mystery as to why none of his kids never talk to him.
This.
Lmao! That would get under his skin for sure! It'd also be good cover
Thank you so much 💓
I plan to do that as well next time I see him
I put my mental health before him a long time ago, I actually secretly moved out one day to go live with my girlfriend because I decided to move on and was sick of staying with him.

And thank you for your kind words and advice, I'll take it to heart ❤️
Thank you for responding at all honestly, every bit helps *hugs*
I 100% agree. I brought up the issue with him, but his excuse was that my legal name is still my deadname and still uses it for me in his contacts.

He said he'll try to remember next time. I'll believe it when I hear it
yeah honestly i third this approach
I guarantee it was not accidental.
Whoah, the typo dread name is honestly a great term to describe what hearing it does
All this sounds like the next step if telling him off sternly, possibly by text, doesn't change anything.
Very bad sign, yeah. Definitely going to have to set some hard boundaries.
The more you talk about him the more it sounds like he isn't supportive in the slightest. Like not even trying. If anything he's trying to be difficult
You are very welcome *hugs back* if you need to vent my PM's are always open and I know a little how you feel I'm trans mtf too and my parents are still adjusting supportive but still referring to me as he most of the time
Well he needs to change it in his contacts. Have you considered changing your name via deed poll? And making it more legal. Sorry he acted this way, you need to let him know that's not OK.
Does he never call people by their nicknames? Titles? Goodness. I hope he practices using your name. I’m sorry
Perhaps you should start referring to him by his legal name too, seeing as it's legal and all.
Nah, sorry. Your dad is full of shit. He was deliberately misgendering and deadnaming you out of spite. You need to call him out on it.
Thats such a garbage excuse. Im sorry hes being like that. Idk how you are as a person, but in your shoes id dial up the petty considerably when dealing with him.
Pssshhhhtttt..ya okay. ""it's still your legal name"" is the oldest trick in the book. 🙄 Im pretty sure ""Dad"" is not your dad's legal name either.. some of my family pulled this card with me and just didnt ever use my name or pronouns. So silly me thought that once i got it legally changed and on my ID they would fall in line. Spoiler alert: they did not change. Its not about your name being your legal name...thats just something hes saying to justify HIS unwillingness to respect your identity.
Don't buy into that bullshit. That was 100% intentional and him abusing you through public humiliation.
Ah yes, because randomly strangers need to know your legal name in casual conversations ffs 
I really don’t get those people
That’s not even an excuse. It sounds though that he’s having a hard time accepting the reality that his kid is trans and isn’t coping well despite loving you.
I agree it very very likely was. The non-accusatory approach doesn’t give them justification to get defensive and play the victim. You’re throwing them a rope, they can either use it as a lifeline, or you can watch them tie a noose for themselves in real time.
Thank you 😭😭😭
The first thing I did when my daughter chose her name was to put it in my contacts correctly. There's really no excuse for this and doesn't seem like a slip-up to me. My daughter still presents male so I asked her about this very situation because I always want to follow her lead. She said in a public setting that isn't 100% supportive to use gender neutral pronouns for now.
I don’t know where OP is located but fwiw deed poll name changes don’t exist most places and at least in a lot of the US changing your name is pretty expensive. For example, in my state it’s close to $400 to change your name. Not saying it’s a bad idea, just that it may be much harder to do some places
Definitely the best approach but I'm saying it wasn't accidental because shouting their deadname across a room full of people? I mean that's rude at the best of times but deadnaming your own child that way is pure unadulterated passive aggression.
You're very welcome 😊
Aw i wish i had a mum like you. I am in a similar situation but my parents are conservative and religious as well as my mum is transphobic.
I'm so sorry, that has to be so hurtful. I am sending you love and hugs and hope that maybe someday they will appreciate having such a beautiful person as their child.

I have no idea how to deal with this	I just talked to my mom about being trans. And she told me that when was a little kid she didn't know was a female, she always felt like a boy or male. She then started to say she feels like she's in drag whenever she presents femininely. She felt like her body was a curse she was stuck in, and that she could never feel connected to other girls but did to boys. She told me this after I was venting about wanting to be male and to relate she said this casually like all cis women feel this way. I told her no cis woman felt this way. She literally assumed that all women feel this way. She also misgenders me all the time. What the fuck.	"Somebody’s closeted and has internalized transphobia
Yeah that's messed up. Ummm pretty sure she may also be trans.
Like that sounds pretty dang like dysphoria to me. Yo egg donor be yo bonus daddy but they don't wanna accept it.
My mother is the same. She says that she  felt like having no gender since 7 yrs old, and that she didn't understand why we needed it but that she had to ""choose"" to be female, and that that's what women have to do. Then we watching QueerEye and she said the trans girl in the show was selfish because her dad raised and expected a boy (i'm unformally out, i told her i wasn't comfortable with my agab but nothing else)  It's their internalized transphobia that doesn't let them realize. Honestly i don't think there's much to do because unless she wants to change. I'd recomend visiting some sort of LGBT parent-children group, orrr therapy

Sorry about the vent lol, i wanted to post this but my posts never get approven so, sorry lmao...
I think your egg parent needs to do some soul searching.
I'm literally in the exact same boat. It is an infuriating cycle of ""I don't understand"" and ""I completely understand but that doesn't make me trans!!""   


If you ever need a buddy to vent to, I'm here.
internalized transphobia is real. i’ve dealt with it a lot in therapy. i hope you and your parent have someone to talk to about these feelings 💞
Beware the prime directive. If you try to tell an egg theyre trans, theyre more likely to reject it. The gender dysphoria bible is good but focuses more on trans women. Maybe get a short wig and large hoodie and have them try that on? Just offer them baby steps, lie about your intentions if you have to. “Oh, i just need to see this style on someone else to check my work” or some bullshit
It sounds like mom would probably benefit greatly from some work with a therapist. I avoided it like the plague until my late 40s but it has been amazingly helpful. Among other things my therapist helped me realize just how much and how long I'd been avoiding/suppressing being trans because I was so busy trying to take care of others that I neglected myself.
she sounds like she has really bad internalized transphobia and is projecting it onto you tbh
I'm sorry she said this to you. My mother said the same exact thing when I came out it sucks.
What’s annoying about this is yes even if she is trans like what the fuck ever. This wasn’t about her. You were asking for help with your pain and she made it about herself to invalidate you fuck that shit. You just needed help and love. I’m sorry about that.
I’m sorry that happened. She might be an egg or maybe not. Sometimes people internalize their feelings and turn it into a queerphobia but it could also be that’s how she feels. Again it’s Rory that happened and I hope she gets the memo that you are who you are (female I’m presuming?)
maybe tell your parent to ask some of their friends if they feel the same?
Oh wow that definitely sounds like internalized transphobia and that she (or technically he) is having trouble accepting it.
Uggg. I hate when my mom says this. Then I have to explain, its not just that.....im sorry bro. 

respect for you man -\_-
She’s got some internalized transphobia, maybe a trans friendly therapist can help you two out
Go find ~~MTF~~ FTM egg memes and send a new one to her every day.
massive internalised phobia from them there
She deffo has some insolved gender dysphoria herself she needs to work through
reminds me of that tumblr-I think- post where the mum (mtf) misgendered her kid (ftm) because she thought all boys wanted to be girls and was mad that the kid was ""throwing it away"". This was communicated after her egg cracked. 

I hope your parent quits misgendering you and manages to unlearn all that internalised transphobia
Unaware trans, hope you and your mom get resources and support ya need.
When my egg cracked, for real real. 


My trans friend says to me “I wish I had a dick”

And my first thought was “why the fuck would anyone want that?”
And my second thought was “let’s look into that later”




I feel like your mom just had that moment too
I think your mom needs to do some soul exploration and do some meditation focused on how they feel as a human living with her own heart and try to find themselves in it and also needs to accept that you may have a stronger feeling towards that notion than she ever will if she's like this tho if she explains feeling like that she should talk about it during a session of just chat with you and try to keep transphobia out of the equation just say you need a free space to talk and then ask her to just relax with you and have some tea and go over how you feel and point out the differences like the things you are dysphoric about and why and if she isn't respectful or understanding drop the Convo and go vent on a game or do something to get your frustrations out after that rinse and repeat if she can't talk with you without telling you that you're wrong instead of trying to understand how you feel then you need to let her know it's not ok but in a way that's passive and not aimed at her so she doesn't get ammo just a quick cut off to the Convo until she can try to be understanding and com back to it think about it like squirting a cat with a spray bottle of water tho not literally but it works on getting them to realize that what they are doing is both offensive and not what you need at the moment
I think your mom is also going through some things too. I wouldn't worry too much about her misgendering you rn, not that it isn't important, but maybe it's just some internalized stuff that will come to pass. But that's only if she works on herself, if she doesn't, you make sure she calls you by the correct name and terms
Your mom is a meme

Child: complains about ADHD problems

Undiagnosed parent: oh honey, everyone has trouble with that


Can you ask her to ask some women to see if they actually do feel that way? Preferably in front of you
Try directing her to [the gender dysphoria bible](https://genderdysphoria.fyi), it’ll probably help both of you
This happened to me with my mama, except with a more positive ending. When I came out, she said she's always been a boy in her dreams, and she's always rejected feminine clothing (I knew this already). I talked a bit about what my dysphoria feels like and it was obvious she recognised those feelings. A few days after we talked, she told me she started wearing a ""man's"" jacket she had bought months ago but not been brave enough to try. I told her it's never too late to transition and she laughed and said ""I'm writing a book right now! I don't have time!"" XD But I like to hope that one day she might transition with me if she wants to. She's been looking up voice masculinisation exercises for me so that she can be sure ""you don't hurt your voice,"" which I think is a really sweet motherly thing to do.  
Maybe your mom will come around and maybe she'll start to recognise her gender experience in your own. That's my hope. Sorry she's misgendering you and arguing with you.
I feel pity toward your mom. Sounds like she’s never examined herself enough to truly understand why she’s felt this way, but instead, went with the “flow” of society’s standards. You, on the other hand, have a different approach, it sounds like you’ve examined yourself, and do not wish to go with the “flow” but rather be authentic. Keep going that route. Don’t let someone who doesn’t know themselves, tell YOU how to be yourself, like what your mom is doing. She’s minimizing and dismissing your attempts at finding YOU. And that’s not love. That’s fear. Be strong. Be you. Be the light to her and show her there is nothing to fear when you cling to being your authentic self. 🙏
I don't think it's that weird of a conclusion for someone growing up trans and not knowing what trans is to make ... 
I thought assumed all boys were fighting inner feminine selves and that containing it was the ""whole masc game.""

But.. nope it was just my game. .. fighting myself.. oblivious that i was alone in this game.. always trying to ""win"" at being masc.. and then projecting this onto everyone around me.. it wasn't a good place to live. 

Give ur mom a hug.
The worst transphobia and homophobia comes from people who are struggling with their own repressed stuff. People who are completely cis or completely straight just aren’t as threatened by those of us who are out.
direct your mom to egg\_irl? /hj
I have heard this argument before. It’s kind of silly. I think most people at some point in their lives asks themselves a series of important questions, and sometimes they don’t like the answer. I think it’s where you get the projection thing of “I’m going though this therefor everyone goes though it” 

It’s a bit silly but when you grow up in a time where being gay isn’t even that well known, being trans is a whole other ball park in the next solar system over. 

I would say just continue what you need to do to make yourself happy. I think it’ll set an example for your parents and make them see “No. that is not a normal thought and there are ways of dealing with it”.

Stay strong. You got this.
When I came out to my mom as a lesbian she did pretty much the same thing. Told me that if it had been okay with god she would have liked girls, but since god wasn’t okay with that she eventually “got over it”
She sounds like she's in denial about being trans herself and has interanalized transphobia
Closeted/in denial parents are exhaustingggggggg. I’m so sorry OP. My mother did the same thing when I came out as gay.
[removed]
Just remember parents are human too and make mistakes.
So, yes in theory your mother could have similar feelings like that; however, I remember reading child development research about how effectively again (with a certain percentage) females relate to other females in a way that shows connection send similarity even when the peer may not actually have such a concern: girl 1: I'm so sad my grandmother died last week girl two: (eventually) I know how you feel my uncle passed away last year and it was pretty disconcerting.

A lot of gender identity is on a spectrum so for example: more or less masculine or feminine etc. That can also have some migration too even throughout the day: but then it goes back to your baseline. 

The difference between your transgender identity and a largely cis person's identity would be orders of magnitude. Example: one of my friends is transgender female. The explanation I got before I had the conviction to look inside myself was this: someone may wear the clothes of another person, cross dress etc. She had apparently felt so firm in her true identity as a female that she had carved a vaginal canal into her groin herself. 

I was shocked; and, was relieved that she had been able to be herself in the present and leave that wall of pain behind. 

Now this doesn't mean that one person's trans experience has to be the same as another: all are different, however it's likely much less for your mom. 

I would probably say more gender fluid than anything. 

Then again labels aren't really helpful. Eventually I hope people are just people and can feel free, safe, and supported enough to look inside and do things that fit.
Trans has a heritable component.
yeah for sure. She talked about feeling like she never wanted to be a woman but never to this extent. I honestly was a bit shocked but then everything made sense.
Yep
Yeah me too.
Ermmm while it’s not off the table, I don’t think that exploring gender counts as trans if someone’s just.. not trans
“Bonus daddy” is a great term
Yeah, that's what I'm thinking. She doesn't want to believe it though.
""egg donor"" is accurate.
it's okay, my mom is similar. I hope you guys also work it out.
I told them that and they laughed in my face, hopefully, they will think about it though.
You took the words out of my mouth. She says she doesn't like ""labels"". And then is transphobic. Also thank you that's really nice, same offer back.
Yeah, it really does. All her transphobia feels so displaced, I'm still angry but now I just wonder how things could have been for us. I hope things are better for you now.
I really appreciate this comment, I kinda forgot that they have hurt me too. She has also outed me in dangerous situations, and otherwise growing up they have been abusive. Thank you for giving me for perspective to think about.
I am afab, I hope she can figure herself out too.  This isn't the first time she's been transphobic or said stuff about not being a woman. Just the first time in this much detail.
I did tell her that, but they just laughed it off. Though I do hope they look into it.
Thank you, I hope things with your mom get better. Mine still thinks that I'm not really trans and that I'll grow into a woman. It's weird though realizing that It's not about me it's just about my mom's transphobia.
You mean FTM
Thank you, I will. I appreciate the support so much.
Wow. You really have nothing better to do?
The gender dysphoria come from the difference between the visible body and how the brain work.

When the baby is not birthed yet there is a moment where the brain is developing, if at this moment there is more eustrogen the brain will work like a woman brain if there is more testosterone the brain will work like a men and if it's a mix of both the brain will be between the two (non binary). Trans people literally have a brain of there gender in a body that is not there gender

And if you want to argue about ""the brain will have problem if it's not the right hormones going in"" (i already saw this argument multiple times) yes, not having the right hormones create problem, the problem we observe on pre transition trans people and disappear when taking HRT, for example when we take the hormones we need dissociation completely disappear (or appear if you take the treatment but you're not trans)
I know she had just been abusive before, and transphobic to me.  I honestly don't know if I can forgive her. I wish she can find herself though.
>Just remember parents are human too and make mistakes.

For me their mistake was having children.
Anytime someone says ""all (insert type of person here) feels like that"" it's a sign they may be that thing.
I said ""may""
Insecurity displayed with deflection. If they didn't laugh with it like it was a funny joke, then this will haunt them.
There be cracks in that eggs' shell. The hardest part I've found is two pronged: 1.) how did I not know I was this way/why did everyone go along with the imposter version of me 2.) It's either everybody feels this/thinks this way but it goes away or 'cis people do not have these teter feelings in them.' For them it's a weird uncomfortable silly thought...its like anti-thinking (thoughts you're not supposed to have and so your brain tells you AGHHH BAD dont think about that shit) 

There are those of us who were so beaten through social pressure to follow norms that we accept the cis life because otherwise there would have been clear signs that would have made us realize sooner. The way we behave and the interests we share are those of the rest of the small 11k person community in our city or smaller town. We might be the weird person in our family but every family has a weird person right? Well, sorta. It didnt occur to me till I was in my 30s and my kid had come out trans a few years earlier. and it wasnt denial, I had literal autistic explanations for everything, which is still denial but only by technicalities. I did mental acrobatics skydiving making hemp woven wicker style baskets blindfolded for a living AMA. It was that bad. Like I couldn't conceive what two gay people going grocery shopping to look like, yet my spouse claimed lesbian and I was an exception to the rule because I was a girl anyway. I thought they were teasing me in a 90s boomer way ""stop being such a Nancyboy"". I didnt know they were soft balling me clues and not razzing me.
Hey, definitely would love to message you, but I’m unsure how to do that through Reddit. I found a book last night that might be helpful. Hmu!
Yeah, I get that. Unfortunately, my situation has never improved. I hope yours will though.
Yeah that’s awful. Like your kid comes first and treating you like this is not okay.
Oh okay. Sorry I wasn’t sure. I’m really sorry you have to deal with that. I wish you luck
thats unfortunate, i guess try to make it a challenge
yes lol Im a bit dyslexic or whatever, I'm switching letters around and  making unintentional spoonerisms
I feel that. I'm still having a hard time forgiving my mom for different reasons. But she one day realized how much she fucked up and has been struggling to make it up to me and my siblings. I believe it's possible your mom can one day find herself and realize how much she's hurt you but it wouldn't be best to just yell it all at her angrily. For now just enjoy yourself as best you can and one day when you aren't relying on her you can be yourself without her able to stop you.
I feel it.
My dad told me all cis women are ashamed of having boobs when I came out to him.

 Not sure what that says about him…
Had a similar thing when I told my mom I was depressed and was constantly having suicidal thoughts. She told me that's just what being a teenager is like. I later found out that both her and my dad had been diagnosed with depression
 ¯\\\_(ツ)_/¯
I read a story once about a daughter coming out as gay to their mom. Mom proceeded to tell them ""all women feel this way, when I was young I was attracted to women too but when I met your father it passed"" and the woman was like ""Jesus Christ mom, you're bi"".
It's truly funny how the people we love so much know even before we do who we are. I had the person who I first fell in love with telling me that she thought I was a butch lesbian when she first saw me for the first time. And getting to know me for over a year she knew, she wouldn't bring it up directly, but she knew that I'm a guy. And it wasn't only her my brother said something very similar to me as well.
I'm sorry to hear that I hope you are okay,  I hope mine does too.
Not anything good.
maybe his first lover was egg or smth idk lmao
Oh, no question. Sadly, not the worst of his takes.
Wait what? How?
He’s a deeply shitty and verbally abusive dude. 🤷‍♂️
Yikes, sorry, any way I can help?
No, I’m grown and long since moved away. Thanks though! It’s mostly just fodder for dark humor now. 

All y’all trying to make it through shitty parents and families, just know that it won’t last forever! It sucks and it’s unfair, but you will be out someday and you get to decide who your family is and who gets to be in your life."	u2d9wl	trans	1480	0.96	2022-04-13 00:14:57
You know what? It's actually not that hard to not deadnane and misgender people.	"I always encounter people talking about how difficult it is to adjust to using a new name and pronouns for someone who is transitioning. Maybe this is just a ""works for me"" kind of thing but... No it's not.

My brother came out as trans to be a few years ago, I've known him his entire life (and most of mine) and I don't struggle to gender him correctly. 

My wife has *forgotten* my deadnane somehow (a feat that impressed even me with my apparently very advanced correct-name using skills)."	"My boss found out my deadname today. He's older, and he hasn't had much contact with queer people. When he first found out that my legal name wasn't the one in the system (I'm barely 18, and am not going to be able to change my name for a few years for logistical reasons, but my workplace is pretty queer-friendly. and when some higher-ups found out that I was trans, they changed it in the system), he immediately started trying to figure out what it was. I tried to explain why I didn't want him to know it, but it didn't seem to get through. Today, I had to watch a new training video, and when he logged me into the video program, he saw my deadname, His reaction was ""That *is* you, right? Well, you told me that name is dead. I know you by \[name\], and that's what I'm going to call you. You're \[name\], and that one is dead.""

it truly is a matter of respect. This man hasn't misgendered me in months (since I had The Trans Talk with him), and I am confidant that he's not going to deadname me. My friends that have known me the longest are the ones who haven't slipped up. If you truly care about and respect someone, referring to them the way they want to be isn't going to be an issue. I understand in the beginning if someone slips up, but if its been months and they still don't get it, its because they don't want to.
Yup! I went to a party with a bunch of my parents friends; all older folks, many who have known me since I was about 7 and haven't seen me since I formally changed my name this past fall.  By the end of the night, pretty much everyone had it right. 

(And omg my partner ALSO forgot my dead name. She saw it on an old box of documents and went ""who the hell is that?"" 😅)
I argue this is much easier with binary pronouns. Trying to change natural English usage and switching to ""they/them"" exclusively isn't as straightforward until you get used to it. Once you're used to it, yeah, isn't a problem.

But the deadnaming thing? So frustrating. Especially when people you care about do it all the time. And once you ask them to change it, suddenly you're like hyperaware of when people deadname you. Ugh.
[deleted]
i mean, it’s understandable to slip up a bit at first but it really shouldn’t be an issue after a while. if people are still deadnaming and misgendering you after they should’ve adjusted they’re just obviously not putting in actual work.
After not seeing me for two years my grandmother and aunt (who are both Republican) didn’t deadname or misgender me once the entire time I saw them. They only learned I was trans and my new name a month before.

Meanwhile I’ve been out to my (liberal) parents for three years and they still misgender and deadname me and make the excuse that it’s hard to change to a new name/pronoun (at certain points they even asked me to change both).

It’s really not that hard to switch and if someone is constantly messing up and making excuses long after it’s acceptable then their just showing you that they don’t have enough basic respect to actually put in the effort.
Dude I accidentally misgender and deadname myself all the time. I've been out publically since early last year.

Today I was signing yearbooks and almost signed my deadname on two seperate occasions. I haven't written it in ages and it still almost happened.

It took me about 8 months to stop screwing up my friends pronouns, and I'd only known them for about a year before they changed them. How much worse if I'd known them for longer. 

I personally have ADHD, but there's any number of other non-malicious reasons why people screw up. It's not nearly that easy for everyone.
Fr my closest friends have never slipped up even once. Other friends who I wasn't super close with messed up a few times here and there but immediately corrected themselves. But my extended family? 0 effort. They ain't even trying 🙄 when my mom talks to me she's always like OMG DONT GET MAD ME when I literally don't say a word when she messes up 😭 she will mess up and immediately say that like I started yelling when I'm just silent sjejwj 😭 

For me personally though, I find I struggle with new names if they are different syllables haha idk why but for friends who went from a one syllable name to another one syllable name, I have no issues. But I have a cis friend who had a 2 syllable name and now wants to go by her 1 syllable middle name and I still keep messing up when I say it out loud, despite always thinking it in my head. But tbh I still sometimes deadname myself in my head even tho it's been like 4 -5 years by my name 😅
When people told me that they ""needed time"" I asked, so how much time do you need? Because, I ain't got the time to be deadnamed and misgenderered by you.
I switched to my new name at work about two months ago.  People have got it wrong maybe a total of 5 times and so far no one has got it wrong more than once. It's a friendly workplace and people immediately gave me little nicknames based on my name.  It's fine.  It is not difficult at all.  It's just learning someone's name, which we all know is easier for some people than others but also know that all of us can do.

There's been a little more problem with pronouns, I'm they/them and I think for a lot of colleagues I'm their first - no one is saying it's too hard or not trying, but it is taking them a minute. There's a core group of people getting this right too which will help others get used to it.  I've a colleague in her 70s who has not once got the right pronoun so far, but she wrote me a really heartfelt letter saying she was proud of me for being out in a way that taught her something new, so I know she will.
What astounds me is the ""you don't know how hard it is!"" Sure. I, a trans girl, with a ton of trans friends, has clearly never dealt with someone I know changing their name or pronouns. Shit, both happen on what seems like at least a monthly basis.
All you really have to do is to actually see the person as that gender and name and accept that that is what they are. I'm pretty sure using the right name and pronouns is only hard if you just do it to be nice.
It's literally as easy as correctly gendering a dog.
It's... A bit hard for me, I have to keep it at the front of my mind. I'm really trying but it's hard for me and I'm trans :(


Only pronouns, not dead naming
mother of trans daughter - i had no issue switching. I just verbally out loud corrected when i got it wrong and repeated sentances, and even if i had thoughts , i would repeat/correct myself. only the odd accident for the first month or 2.  


I struggled more with the mental gender for a lot longer before my brain accepted she was a girl, probably a year or so, but nothing verbal.
It's about respect, period. It baffles and infuriates me that the same people who think that people should ""get over"" being misgendered will get *pissed* if you call them Rob when their name is Robert.
Thank you. It isn't hard if you actually give a shit and put forth the effort. Don't bitch at me about how ""hard"" it is. My 76 year old grandfather didn't have a problem with me or my fiancée and our pronouns and names. There's no excuse other than just being a dick.
One of my sister's friends came out as nonbinary, and despite me being only like 11 or 12 at the time, it was easy to adjust to their new name and pronouns. It's really not that hard.
Yeah, it’s really not that difficult. If you can call a Pokémon by a new name after it evolves, you can call a trans person by their preferred name.
it can be harder for some people than others, but it’s pretty easy for everyone. what i HATED was when i came out to my parents, instead of correcting themselves quickly and moving on if they deadnamed me they’d go: “deadname… wait no ROBIIIINNN. GOT TO GET IT RIIIIIGHT.”
Right???? I have a few older family members who talk about trans people they know by saying “Back when [name] was [deadname]” and I’ve tried explaining why it’s not okay to refer to them by their deadname, but they just don’t get it. It makes me even more afraid of coming out if that’s how they’re going to talk about me 🙃
My mother is my best ally in my family (which isn't saying much) and for the longest time she would say how hard it is for her to get used to using my name. I had to point out that it's probably because she hasn't made any really basic effort, like changing my name in her phone. Which finally got her to admit that she doesn't want to use a different name...
This. It’s even worse when they don’t think you’re masc enough so instead of just straight up misgendering you they use “they”.

Feels like something done on purpose to cause dysphoria. I’m a man. I don’t care if it’s “new to you” and will “take getting used to” I don’t care if you think it’s somehow “better” than using “she”. It isn’t. If I wanted to be called “they” I would’ve chosen it as a preferred pronoun and I haven’t. 

I have multiple pins on my vest that have my pronouns, I have a singular pin to remind people to refer to me as “sir” and I have two trans flag pins on the opposing side. I don’t know why this is so hard for you to understand, or why you can’t speak to me properly, but until people decide to act right, I refuse to engage with them. 

I talk about feeling “othered” and not liked by others but not knowing “what I did” and I just get told to make conversation, be more outgoing, but why the fuck would I want to be outgoing and friendly with people who’re constantly disrespecting me and won’t even do me the common decency of referring to me correctly.
Yeah, if my 95 yr old grandpa can get it right, so can you – I never heard him slip up
most people dont bother trying but not to say some people dont have trouble. i deadname myself and its been 2 years now lmao
It definitely is. I literally know how terrible it is to be deadnamed, as a trans person myself, and I struggle *hard* to properly gender my long time trans friends.

I put in the effort, of course, but I still struggle.
I think its understandable to mess pronouns and names up for a time when you first find iyt but it really isn't hard
Not hard for old folks, either! My grandma and late grandpa on my Dad's side? They weren't exactly LGBT supporters before I came out, but when I did? Damned if they didn't make sure they never deadnamed me or misgendered me.
It's not hard, people just want an excuse to disrespect trans people. Also the reason why they make such a fuss when misgendering someone. ""Oh my God I'm so sorry I didn't mean to you know I'm super duper supportive it's just that it's so hard because I've known you all my life as [deadname and wrong pronouns] and it's so sudden and changing it's hard and blah blah blah"". Great way to be a dickhead with trans folks and also guilt trip them into thinking you're in the right
Meh. I sometimes use the wrong name or gender for myself even, so I don't hold it too against people if they mess it up every now and then. You're right that it's not difficult, but sometimes it can just slip out if you're not thinking. If they're just obviously not making the effort to try to do better, that's when it's a problem for me.
I've found that when I'm looking at a person and talking to them, I have zero issue using the correct name and pronouns. And I literally never deadname a person.  

But when I'm talking to someone else about a person, I MIGHT mess up pronouns. But I catch/correct myself and move forward.  

To me, it all comes down to respect. If you respect a person, you will talk to them and treat them the way they ask you to. It shouldn't be that hard. People who constantly mess up and use the wrong name/pronouns and don't correct themselves aren't trying. They're blatantly being disrespectful and people like that aren't worth keeping around.
I can understand people you are around a lot having some issue with it, particularly if you are older when you come out. On that note a little practice should be all it takes to get around that, it isnt that hard.
A cis girl friend of mine decided about 5 years ago to use her middle name instead of her first name because she likes it more. I messed up literally 0 times. So easy. And at that point I was still very far away from the trans community, so it's not because I was used to this type of thing.

People somehow only claim it's hard when it is about a trans person. Curious.
Ikr, my friends who ice known for years will come out to me as trans and I won't make a single mistake. It's really not that difficult, and It's so annoying when people say that it is
I feel this so much! I’ve been out for 6 years and my family still tries to HELP ME UNDERSTAND that it’s so hard to use the pronouns I ask for and that I’m attacking them (???) when I correct them in any way. Also, I got misgendered at the doctor’s office AFTER this woman said my name (that’s been changed for almost 6 years) and had my chart in her face while trying to schedule an appointment for me. I corrected her and all she said was sorry I didn’t know. Like what? How? The ONLY place it has that I’m trans is in a completely different part of my chart that you weren’t even viewing so how did you not know? I’ll never understand. On both fronts. For my family, it’s blatantly obvious that they have no intention of ever recognizing me as a man (FtM) and the lady at the doctor’s office just didn’t take the time to pay attention. It’s rude and no you didn’t just “slip” you made a choice.
Nobody I know deadname or misgenders me apart from my family. Everybody I know adjusted overnight and apart from like 1 instance at the start of my transition literally nobody has ever got it wrong.

The fact that my family do shows that even 3 years later they are just not taking this seriously.. and they wonder why I don't stay in touch.
See I kid up words all the time and it is legitimately difficult for me to not misgender people regardless of their identity. Same thing with name, if one person shares a characteristic with someone else I know I’ll constantly mix up their names, whether it’s skin color/style/the way they talk. It’s sucks and I feel aweful about it, but it’s legitimately difficult for me to gender people correctly and to use their right name. Not everyone’s the same, it really depends on the person. When I do catch myself I always apologize and correct it, but I can’t do anything about it I’ve done this since I was a young kid.
If you don't have the benefit of speaking a gender-neutral language like English, or Hungarian which doesn't even have gendered pronouns, and frequently omits them anyway, getting genders correctly can be a bit tricky.

I mean, I misgender myself all the time, so it's not the end of the world when someone else does it if it's a genuine mistake.
My gf has legit told me that she doesn't realize people are talking about me when they deadname me anymore.
You're experiences are \*not\* everyone's experiences.

Its \*not\* easy for a lot of people to change on a dime, and never screw up.  what is important is not that they get it right 100% of the time, it's that they try to get it right.  People will screw up, even when they are trying.  

Pretending that it's some stupid easy thing to do, and only people who aren't trying will screw up is not healthy and leads to extremely unrealistic expectations in people who are  just starting to transition.
I kind of disagree, but it's only for a specific reason; your wife most likely hadn't used your name in a while. I don't think it's always hard to avoid deadnames, but it takes time. My mother and my sibling had a difficult time with my pronouns, but it wasn't out of refusal to acknowledge my gender identity. My sibling eventually mastered it, but it took like 3 months. It took healthy communication and patience on my part. Do I want to be angry at my mom when she misgenders me? Yeah. But it would be very mean to expect them to learn immediately, she's not a fast learner. But she isn't mad at me, and she's getting my pronouns right more often.
Hey maybe don’t judge other people’s abilities based on your *own* experiences and feelings.
Who needs names or pronouns, seriously. So easy to never use either and therefore never much it up. ""hey you"" is a classic that has worked since the dawn of time. Remembering anyone's name is next to impossible anyway and any conversation you have where you need to use a pronoun is basically talking beyond someone's back, and I don't do that.
thanks for sharing
I think it takes some people longer to reroute the nueral pathways use when referring to you. I plan on. Giving my family a brief grace period while they adjust theirs. After that though, I won't be as forgiving.
The only time it's hard not to dead name someone is when you're under spesific instructions not to call them by the correct name in front of some people in the case they arent out yet.
I really don't see why people can't manage it. The only time I've ever managed to slip up was when I didn't know someone used specific pronouns beforehand. Example: I was having a conversation with a friend and didn't know (because I don't follow them or really listen to their music) that they were non binary when speaking about Sam Smith. I misgendered them, my friend said a single word. ""They"" and immediately I added it all up in my head. I haven't misgendered them since. Like, at most the one tiny slip up is all that people should need to correct themselves. For fuck's sake, it's easier for some people to properly gender dogs and cats than it is people. Uggggghhhhhh.
I can't remember names so I can't deadname people lol
I need to show this post to my grandparents, and is it strange that i sometimes forget my own deadname lmaoo
I have been going by my prefer name for half a year now before I chose to be enby.

Now while I was playing games with a friend he deadname and misgendered me out of nowhere. 🥲
When I got back in touch with my brother that was kicked out of the house (bit of a long story that I'm not typing here), he instantly accepted I was trans and only once deadnamed me on accident.

Bear in mind that my brother was an asshole who would literally try to deck me any chance he got when I knew him, but he didn't even blink when I said I was trans.
I only ever struggle with it when I'm around people who constantly misgender and dead name people. My solution? Spending less time with them.
[deleted]
When my sibling came out to my family almost 2 years ago, we all accepted them and I would never deadname or misgender them on purpose, and I would stop myself before saying the wrong thing out loud. But I won't lie, in my head it took a lot of effort to say ""no, they go by this name now"" when by instinct I've been calling them a different name for 18 years. It takes a while to rewrite your first instinct after knowing them for so long, but almost 2 years later I think I'm thinking of their new name first instead of having to reming myself.

Now I'm in the process of coming out to my family with new a name and pronouns, so we're going to do this again for me. I hope it goes well, it went well for my sibling.
I am trans and I have difficulty my ex changed pronouns and my siblings has recently told me they are nb it can take some time of course it’s different for everyone the worst part for me is I’m having to constantly switch between names and pronouns because they arnt out to everyone, it can be difficult but there comes a time when it’s not accidental
(Still questioning my gender identity, don't claim myself to be trans currently, but....)

I've not gone by my legal deadname since I wad born. My mother decided to give me two middle names, which the initials of my full name because the name I went by. I don't feel a need currently to even change my name legally tp what I go by, but I can tell you from experience that people get it a lot better than they claim. If people could respectfully call me by a nickname my parents designated to me upon infancy, then they can remember names and pronouns.
I'd understand taking a few days to adjust if you've known the person a long time, for example, you're a parent and a child tells you they're trans, especially if it's later in life (I was a teenager when I came out) but that was a year and a half ago and my mom still messes up which is understandably frustrating
I do. It's hard for me.
I know I've known my girlfriend's deadname because of some paperwork stuff, like, I know I have witnessed it. But I have zero fucking idea of what it is, there are like three different options in my brain and I'm not even sure which one it is. I'm happy enough about it, she's Hellen and no other name to me.
It took me a little while to train myself to stop saying “you guys” now I say “y’all”

I’m an idiot. If I can do it anyone can.
The most that ever happens to me is that I accidentally misgender someone in my head, (especially non binary people, just because my language doesn't have many gender neutral terms), but so far I've always caught myself before slipping up and saying/writing something wrong.
My boyfriend also forgot my deadname even though I didn't go by a new name until we had already been dating for like 4 years lmao
My partner gets confused occasionally seeing my deadname in reference to me when it pops up
I tend to struggle not misgenderering and dead naming but that's due to my insanely bad memory if I know someone as x and they go to y it'll be hard for me, I deadname myself sometimes which just proves my point (sadly)
I think people overact how hard it is and it can be harder for different people, but I still sometimes slip up with my friend whose recently changed their name and pronouns
I'm only out to my brother, mom, and most of my friends, so my mom told me that she doesn't want to use my new name and pronouns cause she's afraid she'll slip up and call me that around people I'm not out to. I'm incredibly lucky to have a parent so supportive of the LGBTQ community. She got fired from a teacher because she was talking about that kind of thing, and then students went home and told their parents. That's fucking stupid that she fired for encouraging people NOT to bully others. How do people get away with that shit?
Fully agreed, for the most part. I have a few friends who the minute I started transitioning they haven’t skipped a beat and didn’t fuck up my name/pronouns once. Or if they do they immediately catch themselves and correct. 



On the other hand, a good chunk of my family and old friends still fuck up constantly and part of me wonders if it’s deliberate denial/subconscious disapproval. I get that for some people it’s hard to break that mental link with name/face association, but that’s also not an excuse for continuing to misgender someone. Most of my family does this shit and then complains about how hard it is to correct themselves. My mom constantly uses my deadname when referring to me in the past because “you were a guy and you weren’t [new name] yet”. It’s that kind of stuff that irks me, and you can tell there’s that hint of transphobia/denial about it
Some people have habitual recognition and others have attentive recognition. You can't help that. A person should definitely put in effort but if they slip then it's perfectly natural, so long as they are apologetic and show they are making an effort.
I low key wish me or my partner could forget my deadname but it’s kinda hard considering it’s his chosen name
Agreed, like, its really not, it takes time of they’re a friend you’ve known for a long time, but it isnt impossible
Yes absolutely---- learning a person's pronouns and how they identify and the name(s) they wish to be called isn't that difficult, and if you're unsure or forget it's okay and better to politely ask rather than be a complete butthead and get it wrong, even by accident. Learn the habit straightaway and practice in your head with people to make sure you got it correct.
Misread the title was incredibly confused
Depending how close I am or how recently I met them I’ll note down the name and any important info otherwise I stick to very neural terms so I don’t end up doing that to anyone also I am forgetful as hell some days. However you ask me something obscure about something I find interesting different story. But I agree it isn’t hard to not deadname or misgender people.
I wouldn't call it a struggle. People who have known me for a long time before I came out (like my sibling) slipped a few times out of habit at first. I think that is understandable, but beyond that is just stubbornness/carelessness.
People who don't get it would call charmillion a charmander 
It's not hard to change the name you call someone or something, names change and alter with just your relationship with a person, pronouns are a little harder because those are ingrained with specific traits, people call you what you're perceived as and that is often determined by your voice, chest, and hair.

Long story short, I have no mercy for people who deadname but I can understand pronoun slip-ups cuz it happens to me sometimes
When I was outed by my mom (My family is supportive, she just didn't realize I wasn't ready to tell them) my uncle was talking about how HARD it is to use new names and pronouns, and he asked me if it was hard for me and I just said, ""Uh, not really."" and left. The only time new names/pronouns become difficult to me is when they use neopronouns that I have trouble with or if they switch names very frequently, but I always get it right eventually.
Gonna be the dissenting opinion: I misgendered and deadnamed MYSELF for a year despite having very very intense dysphoria. I find it very difficult and the only thing close to a cognitive impairment I have is adhd which wouldnt affect that. I find it very difficult and I have sympathy for people who struggle with the switch, especially if multiple people in their life are switching names and pronouns because then I usually end up using the wrong one for the wrong people hahaha
It's no hard, it's hard to get used to though. I'm a trans women and many family member and friends were very supportive, but when I first started using my new name an pronouns they did slip up sometimes. All I ask is that people try, as long as you don't purposely misgender/dead name me I understand. I've accidentally dead named my partner b4 and often use the wrong pronouns for friends bc i jus have an awful memory and forget to correct myself. I've been doing better, but still when someone transitions it doesn't take a bit of getting used to. Especially pronouns and names
But it takes a whole 1/135,758,421,245th of my brain power and that’s all I’m capable of using at any given time😔
I don't have problem with pronounce just names. Because I forget them in seconds. It takes a week of hammering it in, but I don't deadname anybody
My mother who was known me by my dead name my whole life was able to change to Blair pretty quickly. My stepdad who has known me since i was 5 or so won't bother to even try. My dentist (who is conservative mind you) is trying to make sure I'm comfortable. It really isn't. It's a matter of ""do I respect, and care about this person enough to refer to them as they are""
Personally I have major memory issues when it comes to names so I even have to catch myself when referring to myself. For me if it wasn’t the only name I knew them by it will probably take months before I don’t have to consciously remember to say the correct name. But for someone who doesn’t have issues with remembering names they shouldn’t have a hard time
I know my partner’s deadname only because they’ve shown me screenshots of text conversations or past discord dms with it being used.. my parents and sisters found out as well because one ofmy sisters went to school with her. they refuse to use his true name and whenever my family refers to them as his deadname I genuinely get confused as to who they’re talking about- it just isn’t her name, and calling them the right name isn’t hard. my family just refuses to accept it :/
I think the key thing I look for in people when I tell them my preferred name and pronouns is that they are at least *trying* to correct themselves. I get getting into a new habit when referring to me is tough, just try to correct yourself and we’re good
Its really not hard

Its one thing when its a simple mess up like my friends do on occasion (misgendering) but its not hard unless you try

Half the time people just dont even put in effort :/
Seriously! This comedy special shut with Ricky whoever is so fucking annoying!!! ITS NOT THAT FUCKING HARD TO BE NICE TO TRANS PEOPLE OMFG. (I’m a bit mad about this if you can’t tell). Everything seems like it’s getting worse and it’s annoying and terrifying.
Ikr, unless I’m on a horse in the desert remember my danm name
It can be hard for some especially if you aren't entirely out, so they have to pick and choose context. What isn't hard is not complaining about it like a whiny bitch and just trying to get it right.
I totally get the anger. I'm deadnamed and misgendered on a daily basis by my mother. But if I'm going to be fair, every now and then I slip up. I do catch myself immediately after, but still
>I understand in the beginning if someone slips up, but if its been months and they still don't get it, its because they don't want to.

This is exactly my issue with my parents. They claim to be supportive of my transition, yet it's been almost a year now and they're still ""slipping up"" because it's ""difficult to change how they think about me since they made memories for 16 years with a person named [deadname] and I'm throwing that away by changing my name"" 

Yet when someone that's basically my sibling (I've known him since we were toddlers) came out as a trans guy, my parents  switch up immediately and start using his name/pronouns and all that. It was never about the amount of time they've known me, or the fake difficulty of adjusting. They only care when it's not their own spawn. That is one of the many reasons I plan on moving out the second I hit 18.

>If you truly care about and respect someone, referring to them the way they want to be isn't going to be an issue. I understand in the beginning if someone slips up, but if its been months and they still don't get it, its because they don't want to.

And this is exactly what I went on contact with my dad. My family spent the weekend with him and his husband and I was constantly dead-named and misgendered. I had been out 14 months. I talked to my brother about it and it turned out my dad made zero effort when I wasn't around to use my correct name and pronouns and my brother had warned him that it was going to upset me if he was dead naming me and misgendering me, and he just chose to do it anyways.
I just realised that I have completely forgotten the deadnames of two of my close friends. I'm not *super* surprised, because names are a particular problem for my memory, but I'm glad it's their deadnames I've forgotten and not their *actual* names!
that’s so sweet. when older people get it it just shows that anyone can understand this sort of thing.
My partner has only known my preferred name but I've mentioned my dead name multiple times, usually cus I'm in the closet so if he meets my mom he will have to use my dead name, and every time I tell him he forgets lol. It's nice that he is so forgetful
It's even worse when they do it on purpose, I mean the family. My sister straight up told me that she would still call me a certain nickname because ""it's the way she talks to me with love"", and even after I told her not to. When I asked her again to stop calling me that, she exploded and said soooo many transphobic things allegedly citing biology and mental illnesses. 

I just told her she's estranged for life for me while she holds such views, and I felt so happy after realizing I wouldn't have to deal with her abuse from now on. My dad wasn't happy about that part cuz he cares a lot about family, though he's still struggling with understanding and accepting me.
As a non-native English speaker, binary pronouns were just as difficult for me as they/them and honestly, neopronouns too. But that's because my native language isn't gendered, so the whole concept is a bit alien and I perceive all pronouns to be the same difficulty (hard, lol)
Some of my relatives always misgender me and when I correct them always go ""but it's just sooooo hard to get used to when you're older, we're trying"". I would believe them except they've never gendered me correctly once. People who are trying get it right at least occasionally. And I've been out to them now for over a year, so there's been plenty of time if they'd been trying to get at least halfway there.
Oh... I'm sorry to say I wasn't really considering this from the perspective of people other than the neurotypical. I haven't really slept in the last two days for a few reasons so I wasn't thinking clearly. I'll have to be more considerate.
I'm somewhat similar to you in the brain go weewoo department, but like for me I just don't remember people until I hear their name or see them, so I've never really screwed up,  except for one time but that wasn't like with a trans person or anything like that, it was with someone I had been friends with for awhile and I just randomly called them a different name while we were hanging out, which I didn't hear, but they did cause they told me, and was looks confused at me.
Sigh, my boss finally gets my name right pretty consistently but still fails to use the right pronouns :/
Exactly. I get people's names, pronouns and terms swapped around all the time, but it's not out of malice. And it's not just trans people. I've been doing it since long before I even heard the word trans. Like I'll say ""his sister"" instead of ""her brother"" because my brain just flip-flopped it. And it is more likely to happen when said people aren't present for some reason. It's like having a face that's right there to put the word to helps me keep it straight. But I fucking try. And if I mess up I say ""Sorry, I meant ____” and continue without making it into a big thing. 

The only person I have met that gets a pass is a friend's grandma. A few years after he came out her dementia got real bad and she just forgot he changed his name. So he got deadnamed because she literally couldn't remember. But she also forgot that one of his cousins got married, another cousin was born, and pretty much anything that was from the last 10 years. So as far as she could remember he was 10 (we were in college at the time) and his name was Emily (obvs not his actual deadname). It hurt, but what can you do? 

As for the ""but it's hard"" part, I've had people who have only ever known me using they/them pronouns and they **still** use the ""But it's hard to change"" line. Change what? I never used anything else since I've met you. 

Tldr- some people don't want to change, so it doesn't matter how much time we give them, they just won't.
For years my grandma has mixed up my deadname and my father’s name. I won’t be upset if she continues to mess up. I know it’s not out of malice.
I think it's kinda funny how my friends got used to my new name and pronouns fairly quickly when I came out to them (somewhere in the neighbourhood of 4 years ago?). I've now been on T for over a year and have had top surgery... and for some reason, some of them are now slipping up every now and then?

I'm not bothered by it, I just think it's kind of fascinating. Granted, I wasn't around them much until recently (cause we were living quite far apart) but still, I hadn't noticed any slip ups after the first couple months.
There's a big difference between ""So I was talking to Jack... damn, I mean Jill..."" and ""So, I was talking to **Jack**, and...""
This is the answer.
Which some people legitimately struggle with...
>despite me being only like 11 or 12 at the time, it was easy to adjust to their new name and pronouns.

It's not ""despite"" you being only like 11 or 12, it's ""because"" of you being only 11 or 12.  The older people are, the harder it is for them to adapt their langauge and to learn new langauges.
It sucks. Personally I don’t always expect perfection from everybody, just effort. But I have a couple indignant family members who constantly complain about how hard it is to refer to me with my correct name and pronouns, even though I’ve been out to them for a while. It’s one thing to fuck up a bit at the beginning if you’re bad at names in general, it’s another to complain about “how it’s impossible it is to use a singular they” and “It’s too hard because I can’t see you as anything other then how I’ve known you for years”. That’s the thing that irks me - mistakes happen, but a lack of effort or willing to totally accept me pisses me off.
Had an enby friend. Went by they/them. Definitely different, but just takes practice.
Same. It's been over six years and they still misgender me, even when talking to me one on one. They somehow manage to insert pronouns into conversation when talking to me, something they never did before I came out. And I didn't even change my name, just pronouns and terms (so child instead of daughter, etc). It's been **SIX YEARS** and they ""need more time, people can't change overnight you know"". Like the average six year old has a vocabulary of several thousand words, and you can't manage to add one (non-binary) and use other words **that are already in your vocabulary**. Like nah, I'm done being patient, you are just determined to never change. 

Meanwhile someone gets married, engaged, etc, and they never screw up the person's new name. But I'm somehow supposed to give them time to figure this out because it's so confusing. Nah, fuck that.
I moved out at 17 and man, it is hard. I had to move back in three years later but once again I’m out. Good luck, all I can say is save up make sure you always have something in your bank.
Good luck. Its hard out there (The reason I'm still at home, lol. Hopefully only for a few months). Make a plan now, save up, and find some people that you can fall back on. Do what you've got to do. Even if your family isn't there for you, there are people out there who will be. Maybe things will change in the 2 years you have left (I've found it takes longer with family, for some reason?), but if it doesn't, or things go bad, its always good to have a plan. good luck, and I wish you the best :)
Me too! I was 48 when I came out to them. October will be two years now. I haven’t spoken with my father (I won’t call him dad any more), since then. 

Last year I had to cut off communication with my mother because she kept dead naming me. Said the same things. I agree it isn’t hard if you love someone. 

When my stepdaughter transitioned, it took me about a month and a half, and her mom about 3 months to get it right. We love her and know it’s important. We worked to make it right. 

I guarantee they still have me in their phone etc. as my deadname. 🙄 That doesn’t help anyone change. It sucks. I miss my mom. Father can go pound sand for all I care. Won’t mourn him when he’s gone. 🤷🏻‍♀️
My father still insists on calling me my childhood nickname. And by my ""childhood nickname"" I mean the name he insisted on calling me even though I never liked it. I started just acting deaf to it. Frustrates the hell out of him, but I don't care. I'm not sharing it because I fucking hate it, but let's go with Bubbles. He'll say ""Bubbles. Bubbles? Bubbles?? BUBBLES I'm talking to you!!! Duckie why aren't you listening?!?!?!?"". And then I'll finally respond and say ""Oh, I didn't hear my name, so I didn't realize you were talking to me"". It's been a few years, he still hasn't caught on.
My family and I are all not neurotypical. We have zero problems either. Not with my younger sister, nor with my girlfriend, nor anyone else.

Being autistic still isn't an excuse for being an asshole.
yeah i mean, if they’ve used one name their whole time knowing you it’s understandable to sometimes slip up. but like again, big difference between occasionally slipping up and actively being unable to use your proper name and pronouns lol
Yes, there is.  But, the OP (and MANY of the posters in this thread) aren't acknowledging that. Saying they never screw up, or that the only reason someone would screw up is because they aren't trying is not correct.
True
But my point still stands, because even their parents were able to adjust pretty quickly.
It really has to do with how hard they try and if they really want to learn I guess.
Actually, most of them hardly knew me before I came out, and they never struggle with my name. I know at least one of them has even forgotten my deadname, lol. It's just the timing of it that I find curious - going from struggling a little, to no struggle at all and back to slipping up.

But yes, obviously not the same as someone who just doesn't try to get it right; this ""issue"" with my friends is just something that came to mind when I read your comment"	vhx5oc	trans	1462	0.94	2022-06-22 05:09:12
I get misgendered as a cis woman by transphobes because of my job. Just because you’re getting misgendered doesn’t mean you’re not “passing”	"I work in healthcare related to gender so work with trans youth a lot. I also work with transphobic parents. I’m a cis woman.

When the parents learn some staff are trans, especially if I tell them that, they sometimes assume I’m probably trans. I pass as cis. I’m never misgendered in another context, so I know this is why. It’s a guess. So when they deliberately misgender me, that tells me some things, and one of them I thought I might share is just this - especially to young people - to reaffirm if you feel you pass then get misgendered and feel dysphoric and terrible - it doesn’t mean you necessarily don’t pass. It could be a pure guess. 

I’m sorry for the hate you’re getting. I’m sorry for how terrible it is right now. Passing isn’t everything but that’s easy for me to say. Things won’t always be so dire. 

A young person said I should tell other young people this is it made them feel a lot better. In solidarity."	"Anyone who misgenders their healthcare provider is making a very dangerous choice. Not saying the healthcare worker will do something bad, but making them stress out even when they could be attempting to save your life seems like a very bad decision.
A different kind of situation but my bf is a cis man with a quite androgynous voice.
He often speak with strangers on the phone and they often call him by a femme version of his name and misgender him simply because his voice isn't clearly masc and it is hard for most people to actually listen to what they are told when they have already made an assumption.
And this is people who is not malicious or for some stupid reason is out to misgender others
[removed]
Thanks for your kind words<3💕
Thank you, I needed to hear this...
This is why “passing” is a bad metric for transition. I understand why it’s necessary for some people’s safety, and I get why some people desire and pursue it, but it ultimately has nothing to do with transitioning “successfully.”
I thought this was written as a trans woman who was somehow being called a cis woman and referring to it as misgendering.

Jfc my dyslexia did not like your title lol
I have people over the phone change pronouns mid convo. My voice passes but I'm still legally deadname so they'll call me ma'am until they see my obvious male name, and then proceed to interrogate me that they are in fact talking to deadname.
When i say yes, and authenticate, and then tell them I'm nb and to by Kirby, they change pronouns on me. 

I hit them with the correction real quick. I know it probably gives them whiplash, but why the fuck are they assuming my gender at all. 

Bout to start making a real serious effort to be called Mx. by govt workers and making sure they know the conversation is not proceeding until they can do it haha
❤️🖤
i didn’t think about the misgendering being *purposely,* might need to take note of that
You are a kind soul, and thank you for making our days that much easier
I do appreciate it
It’s *really* bad for us right now. And many of us, especially the younger ones, only see it getting worse in the future.

Thank you for the work you do and the support you give trans youth. It’s no exaggeration to say it’s absolutely life-saving.
Yeah I'm a trans dude and get mistaken for being a trans woman weirdly often cus I'm built like a brick but have a chest and I like makeup. It's funny getting called sir (in a rude voice) and just staring at them until they realise I have d cups and an ass and realise they just validated the gender of a trans man.
Also cis, and also i get this too.
You’re lovely ❤️
In a similar vein, I'm the gurly girl type and I always enjoy getting gussied up to do anywhere outside our house. My wife couldn't car less about what she wears and it causes odd occurrences. She gets misgendered as a gun or my husband all the time. I'm the trans woman, she is a cis women. It's just sooo odd. Just because I'm all dressed up and she is in sweats. 🤷🏻‍♀️ Any hoo. She is used to it from all the abuse her mom put her through growing up. Everybody thought it was PCOS but was really a sterly laidig tumor converting her e to t. So hair and such. But she isn't a small girl if u know what I mean. Any hoo. Just always gives us a pause when someone makes the mistake. We figure it's a mistake because she hadn't spoke before the moment, and I'm all done up to the 9's 🤷🏻‍♀️

Yah.
As far as helth care.
I'm a disabled combat vet so I receive all my care from the VA and they are best if the best to me. Less my old primary. Absolutely had it out for me. Everything you could name. False self harm reposts to get me denied care. Trying to lie about me being able to safety take hrt by explaining my stattons will kill me if I go on e. Lol. No. Also constantly refering to my male physiology and trying to constantly remind me that I will never be away from it and we will always have to treat everything as if I'm a male and I need to get used to that I will never actually be a woman. Funny all of my labs I'm more woman than man. I may or may not have male or female chromosomes, we never tested. It doesn't matter. Anyways. Once I opened my mouth to my transmission doctors they quickly started an investigation and got me moved over to their office for everything.

So. Aside from the 1. Absolutely everyone has been so helpful, uplifting, empowering, and really has made me feel safe and at home and I really feel amazing in their care and can't wait for each next step on my journey.
A lot of us that do pass and have been at this for a while are well aware of this happening. I see people misgendering random cis women at the store, I've had old white ladies randomly poke me on the back to point out the t-slur to me without realizing I'm trans and the person they're pointing out is clearly cis.

Transphobes do not know what 99% of trans people look like and it becomes more and more clear every day.
I definitely feel this. I’m a trans woman, I completely understand the desire a lot of us have to “pass”. 

But, here’s the thing. If I am having a day where I 100% do not pass by any reasonable standard…but I’m wearing a dress, carrying a purse, and wearing heels…and you still decide to call me “sir”…that has *NOTHING* to do with me. Any reasonable, empathetic human being would either ask me my pronouns or pick up on the very obvious gender markers I’m using and call me “ma’am”. So calling me “sir” in that situation is nothing but you being an asshole and trying to hurt me. 

Which, don’t get me wrong. It does hurt. But the sting is softened by knowing that it’s never an innocent mistake. It’s always a choice. That person could either choose kindness or they could choose hate. And if they’re the type to choose hate? Why should I give a fuck what they think?
I get misgendered at my job... but only by my bosses. Customers don't know shit. Its been months, I know I pass (in voice too), not that it should matter. They do it just to hurt me, or because they just don't fucking care. It does hurt but I'm starting to tell myself to ignore it. At the end of the day theyre just fucking assholes and I'm better off paying them no mind.
Thank you for this! 💜
I'm AFAB and people call me a boy and an ugly man all the time. I'm not FtM either, I just got a weird face lol

And then some people think I don't know what being trans is like because I'm AFAB and not MtF, and even others assume I'm just MtF because I look feminine and state I'm trans.

I don't think passing even is a thing, it's all just blind guess work most of the time. In reality, anyone can look like anything.
Thank you for explaining this.  I'm a passing trans woman and have been trying to explain this to younger trans women for awhile, but they have a hard time listening.  Every time I feel dysphoric, I find my same features among cis women, often even models !  Thanks for saying this; It means a lot more coming from a cis woman.
Thank you for this post. ❤️ Thank you for your solidarity and humanity. ❤️ It's easy to give up on cis folks but every now and again someone does something nice or actually gets it. ✨
I was going to agree, but then you said ""it was a guess"" when what I was reading was ""you gave transphobes the information that trans people exist in their vicinity, so they start misgendering every person around to make sure they cause as much damage as possible"". No offense, but you need to understand that they say this stuff *specifically to hurt us and to make a statement that they don't support us*. Normal people don't go around trying to ""guess"" people's gender, because normal people know gender-neutral terminology exists, transphobes refuse to use said language even if it makes them look stupid, same as they'll look a cis woman in the face and call her a man, just because there's a chance to disapprove a trans person.

So yeah, sorry, but you were close, but these people aren't invalidating your existence so it's not quite the same
Very cool
Definitely wouldn’t help the situation at all. When I occasionally get misgendered it totally throws my train of thought off the rails for a few moments. 

It seems like a good comparison would be popping a balloon behind someone when they’re trying to give a speech or cutting your hair
To people like that, their hatred is more important than anything else. It's the same mentality when a racist has a non white nurse. They'd rather be phobic than think beyond the next minute!
""Oops, that wasn't medicine""
Oh I work in healthcare and am hoping to become a mid-level provider soon. In the field, we know how to just put that all aside and care for the patient. But if someone actively is awful to us and does stuff in malicious intent, we can just fire the patient if they're not in a life threatening situation. So a basic checkup? Yeah, we can make you find someone else.
[removed]
I have a high and femme voice and on the phone people change my name Jasper to a surname (that is very common surname here and suitable for any gender) Jaspers. Nobody had ever met a Jasper that sounds like me. So they change it in their head to make it make sense to them. Very odd to me but made me think of your bf’s xp haha
I saw trans and mental illness and got ready to bring out the keyboard 😅😭
You were *this* close to getting the ban hammer lol
And there's only one cure... 😔
It's really weird how true this is. It's not limited to transphobia tho, it's more like conservatism and all the hate it foster is a mental illness. Unironically most Conservative just had their brain completely broken by mass media and social medias culture war narrative, it's honestly terrifying how brainwashed most of them are. They just react to shape and colors without really thinking about anything. Just talk to them about socialism without using the word and they will agree.

If anything, modern conservatism is a testament to the power of medias.
Well, a question that I've been exploring more and more often recently is ""what if bigotry was just narcissism applied to politics?"". I mean, I've had the displeasure of interracting with both many times in my life and it's astonishing how they both behave in the same way in so many ways.
Oh no sorry! I have dyslexia too. I’m sorry that’s not clear, I didn’t want to lead with “as a cis woman” because i thought that would be even worse with how some people would initially feel on reading it, expecting some horrible full-on cisplaining which I’m really hoping it’s not coming across as and is definitely the risk with this one.
Not dyslexic (but ADHD). Took me a few goes to understand what OP meant too!
Thank the gods that Im not the only one trying to see the issue until my brain finally understood what the words were saying x.x
I also don’t want that to come across as though people will be being more hostile than they probably are either. It’s horrible, I know it feels bad either way but sometimes people are guessing, could be because there’s something ambiguous about your gender, but that could be in expression, or it could be in some mean attempt to make a guess and be hurtful. I suppose my point is it depends so much on your situation, but a lot of young people I work with give me these bogus reasons they think they don’t pass when they absolutely do, and it’s stuff like this that doesn’t help for them. 

I’m so sorry if this has added in more of a sense of people being hostile to you, it’s not intended that way. I just think these instances of hostility show exemplars that sometimes it’s a guess but you feel like they’ve clocked you and the dysphoria from that can just be gut wrenching.

You know what it might be helpful to look at some of the other comments here because people give these brilliant examples of cis people who generally pass as cis being misgendered for non-hostile reasons too.
Yeah my trans friends find this too. I think it’s more powerful as a message from a trans adult than from a cis adult as well.
Thank you for trying to help younger people as well. I know it’s so so hard for them and easy for me to say as I’m not going through it.
No sorry, that wasn’t clear, what I mean is they made a guess that I must be a trans woman. So we’re in agreement, it’s intentional, they just thought they got the right person but they didn’t, because they couldn’t tell who was trans/had previously assumed all staff were cis because all of the staff pass as their gender. They’re ironically admitting that they can’t actually “always tell” as they think they can.

Also I’m not sure if it’s come across that I’m saying it’s hard for me, i don’t experience dysphoria so it’s not any harder than anyone being hostile to me as a healthcare worker. It jumps out though, and it’s interesting l. I will also say that most families are not at all like this.
Anti-choicers (the bigots are all the same people really though) will yell at abortion nurses while they're a patient on the table. These people are not even thinking in the moment.
That’s awesome and I appreciate how professional healthcare workers are. However personally, I would never deliberately antagonize my nurse or doctor lol.
Nah. Being misgendered is really bad. Shouldn’t expect people to be able to shrug it off
Cis genders people have the luxury of having their genders affirmed all the time. I've seen it throw them off when they get misgendered too. Despite what you may think it's a common human experience.
Spoken like an ignorant person who has never worked on the front lines of health care.

Health care workers are just people. When they don't get enough sleep, they make mistakes. When they don't like someone, they are prone to subconscious bias. When someone does something awful to them, like threatening them, yelling at them, or, yes, intentionally misgendering them, it affects their focus and their ability to do their best work.

I wouldn't ever purposefully antagonize a health care professional responsible for my care. It's a dumb and potentially dangerous thing to do. Keep in mind that while doctors hold to the Hippocratic oath, office workers and some medical assistants are not required to. I follow it as closely as I can, and so do most people involved in medicine, but do people slip through who might be willing to fake a mistake or tell you they don't have an appointment for the next two months to punish a bigot? Do you want to risk your life on the premise that every single person involved in any aspect of your medical care, every doctor, nurse, office worker, medical specialist, and insurance liaison, will totally forgive and be unaffected by purposeful bigotry?

I mean, it's your life. Do as you will. I'll be over here being polite and respectful to the people I am entrusting my life to.
Well if that’s how you feel, next time you’re getting a shot or an Iv, spook your nurse just before she stabs you, see how it goes.
yikes bro
Yeah people really be hearing what they expect.

The funny thing is that i got a significant hearing loss so i just avoid using someones name when i speak on the phone with them, and if i need their name for whatever reason i make sure that i actually got their name down and not just what I heard.

But what is weird that someone replied to my bf business email which is not only singed with his common nickname that he goes by but also got the full name in the email line with calling him a femme name. 
Someone not only assumed the wrong shortened name but also managed to reply to their email using an assumed full first name without even what it was signed with?
You were ready to drop some bombs lmao
I support banging cowbells in transphobes' faces
Conservatism is a fear-based disorder
One of my recurring thoughts around conservatism is that it *feels* really good to be a conservative because you’re always right. You’re seeing through all the liberal bs with your common sense and all these dreamer yahoos have no idea what they’re talking about. They just need to get out of the way and let us real Americans handle it. Especially if you’re in a community that feels this way it’s the perfect reinforcing circle jerk. 

Whereas I’m very left, and it does not feel good. Looking at signs of escalating genocide for my people, the climate is increasingly fucked, still on stolen land (US), etc, etc….
You're fine! It's not your fault at all
Lol
Oh it's best you don't, the level of patience we have for that shit is only so high lol eventually we can ask for another provider to step in if it becomes too bad.
i looked at their comment history and it’s just a bunch of transphobic bigotry
Wow! I have got that too but with my surname! My email is litterly jasper-surname-@ and i sign my emails with that as well. 
And then awnser me with the internet-fake-surname i had put in when i made the email account! 
One time i even did a “my surname is -surname-“ and their next email was with the nickname as well! 

Names.. its a thing haha
*banging cowbells into transphobes faces
I think that's just a worry versus confidence.
For example, I'm confident that thanks to the internet progressive ideas will inevitably drown out conservative ideas. It'll take a lot of work but unless the internet goes away it can't be stopped. I'm not conservative at all; I try to make things better. I just try not to worry. If I spot despair, I respond with the hopeful logical.
Yeah it’s just a wild thing for me to consider that people actually do antagonize their providers over stuff like, being gay or trans or a different ethnicity
God its so annoying when that happens cause then you know youre not talking to someone with actual opinions, just regurgitated nonsense 💀
They antagonize providers when they're asked for a pee sample, trust me it's just part of the norm. People are scared, and the usual form of fear is anger and lashing out even at nonsensical stuff. Just gotta ignore what they say/do unless it crosses a very hard line, and take care of them as best as possible."	122o8n1	trans	1453	0.99	2023-03-26 14:40:00

deadnaming magician?	"Okay so somehow at a birthday party woth a magician, the magician somehow figured out my deadname and was like ""whats your name, insert_deadname_here?"" And i was like ""no thats not my name, my name is real_name"" and he was like no its not and im really confused and concerned. Idk how he knew my deadname but he continued deadnaming and misgendering me throughout the party and help im confused how. I want to stop it from happening ever again. Any magicians here know how so i can prevent it? (Im freinds with a lot of people who have magicians at parties, i might be over thinking this though.) Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa"	"That person is not magic, just an asshole. He asked someone else before and kept bothering you wtf ;( so sorry about that
As a magician of about three years, that isn't magic its harassment.
Magic isn’t real it can’t hurt you.  The magician asked before hand and someone have them a wrong answer.
>he continued deadnaming and misgendering me throughout the party

this is where it goes from potentially just an honest mistake to intentional asshattery. I'd have just left. That's so terrible and I'm sorry it happened to you.
So, nobody is looking into who it was that told the magician the deadname in the first place? Does the person who's birthday it was have a secretly transphobic parent perhaps?
I don't think the magician meant to deadname you, likely they got some wrong information beforehand (purposfully given or not I don't know), the magician likely thought you were trying to throw off their act and so insist that was your name. I may be wrong but that seems more likely the case based on having a magician as a father, maintaining the illusion is top priority and trans identity like in mainstream is not really considered when putting together an act.
I woulda just gaslit this guy into thinking that they went to the wrong place or something
Obviously that magician can’t do magic cause they got your name wrong
Is your deadname on your id? That's how I used to do the trick when I tried my hand at stage magic
Diversity loss! This magician is transphobic!

Only thing I can think of is for some reason some asshole told him your deadname thinking it would be a funny magic trick for him to 'read ur mind' to guess it or something? Idk either way it's gross.
Like others have said, the most likely answer is that somebody gave him incorrect information, and he assumed that you were trying to throw him off. Shitty situation all around, but realistically the person that gave the magician your deadname would be in the wrong, not you or the magician.
I mean, he works for some company or something, right? File a complaint?
Trans magician here!! Someone could have told him your deadname beforehand if it was apart of his act, so sorry that happened to you. It's also a cis male dominated industry, it can be tough sometimes when working with other magicians since it seems like the majority of people are overwhelming ignorant to trans issues.
They're grifters who look people up before shows and plenty of them use that grift convince people their transphobia has more merit because they come off as having more innate knowledge about a person. I had a woo friend try to tell me I wasn't a real man because when she gets high my aura is pink. Its all bullshit.
That's not magic, that's transphobia. The magician got your info from someone at the party and decided that it was their job (or they may have even been paid) to harass you.
Is this a joke or am I missing something
Jesus what the hell.
He learned his magic from J.K. Rowling.
Transphobic magic moment.

That's fucked.
Someone told him your deadname.
Find names of other local magicians and next time you see one and they deadname you then call them by another magicians name and keep doing it until they call you by the right name
Can I just say, in spite of the awful circumstances, I think it's really sweet that you're worried about this being an actual magic thing..  
Like others have said though, I think it's probably somebody gave them the wrong name or they got your outdated information some other way. I'm sorry you had to go through that
Like, was this guy just a magician who happened to be at a party or did the host pay him?  I would ask the host about it and ask them to call the company he works for.  That’s completely inappropriate behavior for a guest at their party, let alone a paid entertainer.  Maybe he thought “trans jokes are funny” and asked someone to “play along” and tell him your deadname.  Regardless, obviously someone at the party told him, which sucks. 🫂
He probably talked to someone beforehand and they gave him your deadname, chances are he genuinely didn’t know and thought you were trying to pull a fast one or something and was just tryna maintain the illusion, so i honestly doubt he was trying to be shitty, and it’s likely this was on the person who set up the party rather than the magician himself
That's awful! I'm so sorry to hear that.

Unfortunately there are people like that who will not respect what we ask to be called. I think the best thing to do would be to have supportive friends with you. If someone refuses to respect you after they are corrected, it might be best to just leave. No one should have to be treated like that.
If that were me I would have taken all his props and shoved em where the sun don't shine
May I advocate violence? If not kick him out of the party, pay him only what you are legally required to (if that’s nothing then aw well 🤷‍♀️), leave terrible (but honest) reviews on his website if he has one, etc.

Ps. This is mostly a joke and only applies if he was acc being transphobic. If it just seemed like he was confused too then it might have been a mixup and you should talk to whoever hired him about using the wrong name for you.
They are a bad magician when they don’t even know your name… just saying. 🤷🏻‍♀️
????? what the fuck that so horrible?????? i don't even know what to say wtf i'm so sorry for you
Just playing with your mind
1. Cut all ties with that dick
2. Learn all these tricks yourself
3. Perform at gay events
Next time show him a trick have him look really close at your first to see the trick then deck him in the face for being an asshole
Sounds like a prank to me. This so called magician was told your dead name to them. Don’t be so naïve to think they’re magic. Besides a deadname is dead don’t bring it back to life for someone else’s entertainment. I don’t know your deadname and I don’t know your real name just stay away from those people because it seems to me that someone is back stabbing you. Stay safe and stay real 💕
tell them pick a card and when they reach for one, flip them off and say ""call me by my real name or worse things will happen then me just flipping you off"" or just leave at the flipping off
>Idk how he knew my deadname

Magic :)
you 7 or smth?




im jealous
""Listen asshole, my name is \_\_\_\_\_\_\_. Get the fuck out till you get that shit through your head.""

Depending on how he was hired, find a way to leave a review about how rude he was to the party guests.
He is kind of an asshole, but I think that shit is funny. If I were trying to hide that shit I would just laugh my ass off.
If that magician got paid already I hope he gets mugged.
Some of these tricks are researched in advance, like some other comments have said. I’d it possible someone else at this party thought it was appropriate to share this information with the magician? Is your drivers license/ID up to date? If you have a lot of friends planning on having magicians maybe take them aside and explain if they want you there and want to be a real friend you have a hard line that entertainment cannot cross.

Also did anyone help you out? From your story it just seems like no one stood up for you. Are you ok?
Take heart in knowing that magicians are the lowest form of life
I'm sorry that happened.
Well that’s pretty bad but in your case I’d say that dead naming when you’ve officially changed your name is wrong. Next time you can always show a person like that your ID or your business card if that applies. 

I’m Pan but I changed my name to use my mothers maiden name from my fathers name. So when people call me up from my dads city and use my old name I just either hang up or don’t meet with them until they use my changed name. 

I know it doesn’t apply in your case as I’m guessing you’ve been reborn a new. But as friendly suggestion it would be a best to get it changed legally as well and not use your dead name at all. And when people refer you by your old name just ignore them or don’t answer them. It’s hard to do as we all get mentally attached to our names and your just need to get attached your new name and respond to it only not to the dead name
sounds awful.
You might have been set up and taunted by someone. the asshole Magician homophobe... either got the lowdown from some looser dirtbag has a grudge about you informant. Or they remember you from a long Passing acquaintance. there's nothing to do with ""entertainment"" illusion Magic. Don't worry about other people or Magicians unless their assholes too in on it.
I feel so much sympathy for you, but NGL OP, this is hilarious in like a horrifying dark comedy way. I imagine this being a really cringey scene in a trans autobiography.
i’m italian. an italian doesn’t need magic to make somebody disappear for good.
If that person  is really  a magician  learn magician and his craft
I'm the magician and I'd like to apologize for my actions.
Don't know the whole story, but the magician might not have known OP is trans and just thought it was someone trying to throw him off. He maybe wanted to maintain the illusion or thought OP was joking. 
I don't really know, just guessing.
Happy cake day
Happy cake day!
Okay bc i was kinda panicing about how sombody could figure out your deadname if there was some psychology trick i was just confused mainly
Even for me, a person who somewhat believes in magic, it sounds likely that they just asked for the name. The only way I imagine they could've gotten your deadname is if your legal name somehow left a magical imprint on you?
Unfortunately there's no way to prevent it unless you introduce yourself as name before act or surround yourself with supportive people who'll correct the magician.
oh, that's a really good point - maybe a quick lift, and dropping it back in? And being too stupid (or transphobic) to put it together?
Solo i think.
What the fuck? That doesn’t even make sense, if it was only pink when she’s high, doesn’t that have more to do with her energy/viewpoint than yours?? (Assuming a pink aura even had anything to do with gender in the first place 🙄)

I hate people. ): I’m sorry she said that.
Ehhhhh.... Magician may have been given the Deadname somehow, tried to sound clever by knowing the name, and thought OP was just trying to be difficult. I've done magic here and there, some people just want you to fail so will pretend it isn't their card and the like. So magician may have been operating under that assumption.
evil magic :(
First off adults have birthday parties with themes all the time. Second being misgendered isn't anything to be jealous of, and saying you are  is disrespectful toward OP
O_O
It was sorta darkly comedic
How much should I pay you? /j
Makes sense, but at one point magician was like ""your trying to trick me into thinking you are a girl, are'nt you"" or something like that, so idk what he thought. At least my freinds stood up against him : )
Hanlon's razor: never attribute to malice that which can be adequately explained by neglect
Thanks!!!
Thanks!!
Nope. No trickery. If you are related to the host then a simple Facebook search or the like could get it. Or they asked someone. 

Anything that is a Mentalist trick, or seems to be reading people, is all pre-figured and then presented as either magic or powerful intuition.

Edit: saw was birthday party. Could have asked for a guest list or just overheard your Deadname. And birthday parties are usually heavily one sides for gender, so a general easy assumption.
Well, Magick and Magic are two different things. Magick focuses on spiritual practices and the alteration of one's own perspective in order to influence one's surroundings (ex: performing a ritual to encourage your brain to save money/find opportunities to bring money in). Magic is the use of psychological techniques to gather information subtly,  manipulate an audience's perspective, and create illusions both physically and mentally in order to create a ""trick"" for entertainment purposes. 

This person had to have found out prior to the trick what OP's deadname was, and likely there was a good chance he was potentially transphobic, or someone set him up for this.
Magicians, psychics, etc haven't show any ability to determine anything supernaturally when put in empirical experiments. I doubt this one random asshole has somehow cracked the code. Not to be a downer but surely someone would have taken the Nobel prize for proving magic exists if they could. Since no one has tried I must conclude they are faking and know it.
lmfao that complicates thing
Oh I know. I was too stunned to even explain to her that pink hasn't been associated with femininity as long as whatever ancient religion she was trying to appropriate has been around. 

And I'm totally in favor of taking recreational drugs and hallucinogens but when you look into your own stoned mind for the answers in the world you're just going to keep reenforcing your own biases by telling yourself you're pulling it out of the akashic records when you're really just pulling it out of your ass.
That makes sense. I mean the magicians who get brought to these parties have to deal with all sorts of stuff. Makes sense that he would have to deal with people trying to make it look like the trick failed quite often.


 ~~tldr cis people magic is transphobic~~
No way.  

The odds that he chose her out of the crowd or guest list or whatever, deadnamed her, misgendered her, and continued to do so at random is just too low.

I don't see how he didn't think of this beforehand as part of some transphobic performance.
Ye :(
you understand nothing of what i was saying
and why tf are you in the furry fandom if youre trans thats just askign for more shit
i’ll take bitcoin.
That's pretty gross.  

F that guy.  

He figured out your deadname beforehand.
You were in your rights to say to him that he was being rude and disrespectful
Ahh, yeah. That sucks. Sorry you had to go through that. I don't know if he was deliberately trying to hurt you, but a lot of people just don't get what a struggle things like this can often be.
Stay strong and stick to those friends
How was that guy not chased out with a baseball bat?
Ok, after reading that I'm taking back most of what I said in the magician's defense. What an asshole.
ew, honestly sounds like they were trying to manipulate and gaslight you tbh by finding out your deadname :/
I would've had a hard time not punching the guy. Even if I hadn't been his target.

Fucking dick head.
If it was just your friends then who tf outed you to him?
That plus cold reading. They start with general questions and they push whenever they see a reaction, taking more and more detailed guesses based on your reactions.
Making some assumptions. And it's fine to fight the good fight, but you want to make sure your target is correct. 

We don't know the size of the crowd. We don't know how the magician got the name. We only know the magician was corrected by OP about the name, which again is something that people will do as a way to stick it to a performer; I've had it happen to me in many ways like ""Think of a card"" ""the 20 of Spades"". I've even done the name thing after overhearing a conversation and got a ""that's not my name"".

We don't know about any corrections attempted about gender, or that OP continued to correct the performer. 

Also, a performer tends to not want to make waves as that will hurt their paycheck. 

That all being said, the performer should have, if they assumed OP was trolling, move on to another gag or trick rather than sticking to it. Which just means the performer didn't have enough avenues for escape to fill their time, which is a bad sign. For a 30 minutes show you have 60 minutes of content ready and expect to only get through 10 of it.
Magicians do this every day, it's a really common sort of act to do research on attendees ahead of time, and it almost seems inevitable that someone's going to do this and end up deadnaming a trans person.
That's a deal!
I would want to know who put him up to it.  Good chance that someone else at the party was behind it.
I mean he left before we started playing with the piñatas
Yeah, Even if it was another tran getting attacked I’d kick the magician off the property.
Yeah, for some mentalist stuff working a crowd. But guessing a name of a specific person means they have a plant, accidentally or on purpose.
Hard disagree. I've read OP's other comments in this thread.  The ""magician"" was corrected by OP, he continued to use her deadname, he misgendered her, and at one point said ""are you trying to trick me into thinking you're a girl?"". So clearly it wasn't just one interaction between the 2 of them.

I don't see how you can get this any other way other than being transphobic bullshit.  So he found out her deadname somehow, before the show started, and then used it with her.  How did he figure it out?  Not sure, but there's a good chance he knew it was her deadname as well when he used it.

Even if the crowd was only 5 people, it wouldn't have been appropriate, and I don't see how you can slice it any way other than it being transphobic.  And given that if it was that small of a birthday party everyone there knew OP, so it would have fallen flat anyway.

If it was a bigger crowd it would have made it less likely that he would have picked the trans girl there.

I don't see how you can slice this in a way that isn't transphobic.
So they do the research on the names and they don't find any conflicting anything, or realize that the person is transgender?
Yup, I saw the other comment and now totally agree he's a piece of shit. 

So my defense only works  IF and ONLY IF it was the only situation, like he had the name, thought OP was being a troll, and didn't have a way to deal with it and was given no other corrections. But seems not the case, so total asshole.
I'm guessing they look for as much data as they need to seem spooky about it. If it's a birth record, or a childhood event, or something, whatever they can to get a read on the place. It doesn't have to be deep enough to withstand interrogation, they just have to seem mysteriously able to divine information they shouldn't be able to just figure out out of nowhere. When something they looked up as directly as a name isn't correct, they're going to tend to assume it's some asshole who figured out their schtick and is trying to make them look bad.

There's not really any excuse for someone doing this and not being able to read the room and see that it isn't going well and they messed up, and it seems more likely than not that that was some transphobic bullshit, but I wouldn't be surprised that that kind of cursory investigation would often miss something like a person being trans."	th8vgd	trans	1353	0.97	2022-03-18 17:46:15
Happy Pride Month to me lol :') my dad had a Facebook meltdown about me being trans, TW for his transphobia and a TON of misgendering/deadnaming. It's time to block		"**Context:**

I'm 25 and I moved to a new state last year to start HRT and also just cause I wanted to. My two older siblings stopped talking to my dad like 1-2 years ago. I still was mostly because I was living under his roof at the time. I am not any longer. Ive posted about my dad a couple times here. This will hopefully be the last time.

I shared one of those posts about men at pride who give dad hugs and how sad it is to be able to sob in the arms of a stranger bc your dad won't accept you. My dad texted me saying he assumed that was about him and that it was ridiculous. I should go see him asap. I was at work when he texted me this

Not 10 mins later he commented on a photo I was TAGGED in. So as I'm sure many of you know, the person who posted that photo also got notified of this whole thing, and I feel really bad for her. The pic was me at age 6 on Halloween. My mom commented about how cute it was 8wks ago when it was posted. My dad commented all the stuff in the screenshots lol I guess because he needed to publicly be an ass? He sure loves to air out personal shit too in front of an audience 🙄 he is definitely a narcissist. 

And he's over half a year late to this reaction. He pretended to support me for quite a while. Now he's showing his true colors. I suspected this from the very beginning. Hopefully no one will, but on the off chance someone questions me, yes I have shown him plenty of grace and sent him countless resources and been nothing but kind and patient with him. but he was a shitty father to my not (out) queer siblings and they hate him too so 🤷🏼‍♂️

He also recently commented on a selfie of me looking buff being like ""oh you're just like these buff WOMEN!!"" like seriously fuck him fr it's just so shitty and disrespectful

And lastly: GOD BLESS MY SISTER!!!! 😭😭😭😭🙏🙏🙏🙏 I'm so thankful to have her back me up like that 😭❤️ I was a little worried how she would handle me being trans for a while so it's nice to see her defend me this way ❤️


**In case anyone gets confused:**
Red = my dad

Blue = my sister

White = a former classmate from our school whose like 5 yr older than me. They don't know me well but defended me nonetheless

Green = my other sibling

Purple = my deadname. My real name is Bucky. I blocked out my last name in one of the comments w purple. 

Maya is a family dog who sadly passed away at an old age in a shelter because my sister was unable to support her for extremely valid reasons. It was not a kill shelter, she just died naturally. My sister thought she was going to live longer than she did.

**EDIT: Hi friends I just logged on and had 55 notifs from this post! I'm at work but I'm going to read and reply to all of them eventually. I skimmed a bunch and I feel a lot of love** ❤️

**I wanted to let you all know I blocked my dad on Facebook and I blocked his phone number. I don't think he knows how to find me elsewhere, but I locked my twitter account for the time being just for peace of mind. My sister said this morning that HE blocked HER before she was able to again (Facebook makes you wait 48 hrs to reblock) so idk if that means he noticed me blocking him or what. The only way he'd be able to contact me now is by mailing a letter. On the off chance that he does, he'll likely write my deadname. In which case I can return it to the sender for ""no such name"" at my address :-)**
Sister is an absolute Champion, the dad sucks. Got myself a similar thing in that level!
It's kinda like his answer is in his own transphobia... perhaps trans people are at a higher risk of attempting and/or committing suicide because their own parents don't love them as they are and/or identify but instead berate them with how ""wrong"" their life is, hmmm?!?!
When will people learn.  That 41% statistic was 1. Attempts, not successful suicides, and 2. was whether the person was out or not.  We get suicidal because of a bigoted society, not because we transitioned.  I am part of that statistic.  That's why I came out.  Transition saved my life.
Gotta love it when people think they can speak for you. ""[Deadname] never wanted to be a boy"" like okay buddy

Sorry to hear your dad is a bigoted POS :( it's great that you have your sister at your side though. Stay strong Bucky 🙏
the suicide rate is so high because of transphobia tell me what that mf is on cause i fucking want some

edit: i just got to the second page so i didn’t see that the point was brought up during the conversation
I’m truly sorry your dad is like this Bucky, it’s disgusting how parents can be like this. I’ve had similar experiences with family but I can’t say I understand how you feel, all I can honestly say is that I sympathize with you and if you ever need someone to talk to I’ll do everything I can to respond as frequently as possible. My inbox is always open, especially to a brother like you. I hope your dad will eventually learn so you can see eye to eye before he’s gone and I hope you have a good day.
~~hey man...uh...u left ur deadname in that last pic i think. idk if it bothers u or not but thought id memtion it~~

nvm read ur other comment lol, maya is a cute name for a dog
lol what a loser. sounds like you guys should block him and deny him the satisfaction. it's amazing how these people think they know who we are more than we do even when we never fucking talk to them. I had a grandpa like this guy and believe me I fucking WISH my mother had not let him see me. that man fucked up so much of my life. your sister is doing the right thing keeping their kid from him.
Yeah I'm absolutely never telling my family I'm trans
I'm so glad you've got someone in your life who is unconditionally supportive of you. 

That looks like it hurt a lot, and I'm pretty sure that you know that you're not responsible for making him see the light, but I'm saying it just the same because sometimes you just need to see it. Sometimes parents cannot sacrifice their own comfort- emotional, psychological, whatever- for their kids, at the end of the day. It's not your fault, this isn't your damage that is causing him to act like this. Your dad is exhibiting a lot of anxiety controlling behaviors- he needs help but not from you. I hope he gets it and gets some healing and can come back to you in a respectful and supportive way.
Your sister rocks. I'm so sorry that your dad is giving you such a hard time.
[removed]
... okay, I actually have nothing nice to say about your dad so I'll just say... god, I am so sorry you had to deal with this. What a horrible way for him to talk about his son... I hope you can heal from this soon, I'm very glad you have a truly loving sister, and I wish you a fulfilling life with people who love and see you for who you are.
Your dad doesn’t seem to realize that the suicide rate is only higher for those who are NOT accepted by family. Like Jfc
No offense but your dad kinda sucks
What he neglects to realize is that the reason for a high suicide rate, is due to people like him. And that behavior and mentality such as his, is harmful. Especially from a parent towards their trans child. But, there's plenty of people who love, support, and are very proud of you; like your sister.
This is so painful to read. Parents should love their kids and want them to be happy. I understand this too. My Dad has not been very accepting. He said some hurtful stuff like he is praying for God to ""fix"" me and many other things. I hope my Dad comes around and I hope yours does too.
Bruuuuh, he told your sister “you dont even have the balls-“ 💀💀💀 The cognitive dissonance is strong in him… sorry you’ve had to deal with that kind of disappointment. Definitely the right move to throw the block and start and new chapter without him.
And why does he think the suicide rate is so high? Unaccepting, bigoted family members contribute to that 🙄
Da hecc? He's so rude-   


I'm glad you're following your heart. Congrats on getting away from him lmao
That's something else. Your dad's bigoty has alienated him from all 3 of his children? I mean, I'm shaking my head at this for the dumbassery of it all, but I kind of feel sorry for him when he's older, lonely AF, and realizes that this attitude quite literally cost him his whole family. I hope he figures his shit out before it's too late, if it isn't already.
Situations like this, knowing that suicide rates are high due to bigotry, and what your dad is doing (he needs true hell for what he's doing, I'm glad you are blocking him), make me feel like a traitor to the community because due to being a pansexual enby who has supportive queer parents, I cannot relate well.

Bucky, I would like to award your sister for her vigilance in supporting you against this awful dad of yours. I like that my trans female friend is herself, and I like that you are you, just as I like that Ralsei of Deltarune is Ralsei!
I'm sorry you had to experience this but on the bright side you have lots of people who support you it seems
So sorry this happened to you. I can relate except my situation is the opposite— my sister is the righteous one that has been victimized by my transness and my parents are enjoying getting to know me as their youngest daughter. It’s hard because I basically learned everything about being a girl from quietly observing my sister for 18 years. 

Here’s a warm hug for you….*hug*
Transphobes always leave out the part in that suicide stat that it's for UNSUPPORTED trans people
He's creating the environment that causes us to kill ourselves and then saying I told you so when it happens
My god he’s such a hypocrite. Fuck him. Good luck to you dude! He doesn’t deserve to be in your life.
I’m glad you at least have your siblings that support you, my two younger sisters treat me like a freak.
Ah yes, voicing concern about suicidal people while saying \*exactly\* the sort of shit that exacerbates trans people's suicidal ideation.

How ""lovely"".  


I'm sorry you have to read things like this, especially from a family member. Stay strong.
Yea.. that will fix it
This is the type of person whom I'd like to nominate for a line of mugs and other chachkas with the phrases ""No 1 deadbeat dad!""

And ""ohhkay Boomer""
I humbly agree, having someone like him in your life can be very... bad. And what your father said is honestly awful, hopefully he turns around to reflect but he is in way to deep to where he doesnt understand that trans suicide rates are due to unsupportive people like him. Stay strong and be comfortable with yourself man. Its good that your siblings are there for you, they seem like great people.

And Honestly I feel this on a personal level, ive told a few family members that im cutting off everyone in the family when I leave(Family talks about shooting any lgbt+ people on sight so coming out or staying around them is... like feeling like a sheep in wolves clothing, in a wolves den).

Anyway, stay safe, stay hydrated, stay prideful.
People like you are the reason its so high 💀
“They protect their children from harm”, proceeds to cause immense harm.
r/confidentlyincorrect

Yikes. He’s got a case of conditional love. You deserve so much better OP.
it baffles me how people can be so dumb
Nice to meet you Bucky, glad to see you're living your true self. Hopefully he will leave you alone at the very least and quit trying to make it seem like you're dead. He's a disgusting man, and that is coming from a registered republican who used to think along similar roads as him. It took me a bit to realize at the end of the day that I was the problem even if I wasn't vocal about my disliking and just did it silently, love you for you. Don't let anyone try and make you feel bad about it
-sigh- a true parent should love their children unconditionally and ur so called dad has failed to do so and even tho that parents should protect their children from getting hurt but it is also true that they have no right to tell who u r only u decide that and 4 what it is all worth u r a very handsome man
On the first picture I was going to say that even if your father is a biggot you should still aim to mend your relationship with him. a lot of our folks from the previous generation came from a different, less open and less tolerate world and really do want the best for us. As misguided as they may be - but - upon reading further, I see you have a sibling which also cut contact with him and your father really is persistent in his ignorance so I’m not sure anymore. Do what makes you happy and live your life but please don’t view your father as a villain.. just a fool maybe. Hope he changes his mind and ways as the time goes. For the time being focus on yourself and enjoy your new freedom

Your dad sounds eerily like my mom… 

funny because even though she tries to argue that I killed her daughter, she never lost anything, she just gained a son. I’m a man and a woman lmao
Hey OP: Your dad sucks
Lol i hate my parents
Ew.
Glad your siblings are looking after each other. Absolutely incredible how people who claim to preach love are so filled with hate and ignorance. Not shocking, just impressive and kind of sad.
“Actions that have more than a 50% suicide rate.”

I fucking wonder why
OP, I'm incredibly sorry, but also, incredibly happy for you living your life as your true self I'm still working on figuring out who I am, and...it's hard. Feel like there's no one I can talk to sometimes. I'm glad your support system is as strong as it is.

Also...have to say, the donor for half of your genes (Mot calling that man a father. None of what we're seeing here is fatherly behavior.) has to be the poster child for contradicting himself multiple times within his own comment. Yikes.
I can't fathom ever treating your child or family like that. So fucked up :(
Gosh, I would want to send the last reply to that transphobe so much!
Lmao, as if that guys grandchild will miss not being able to see a fuckhead like him.

Also, hilarious to see him sign off with “you don’t know me >>>:( !!!” after just claiming to know everything about someone.
This breaks my heart. Bucky, your dad wishes he could be even half the man you are. We love you brother
I feel like if it’s FTM dad is sad, if MTF dad is angry
SO tired of shitty fucking unsupportive parents. I’m so sorry. Thank god you have a wonderful sister!
Bucky, I'm so happy you got your sister and people around you who supports you! I hope where you're living now is much better and allowing you to be your true self 💜

I'm sorry about your dad tho, he definitely sounds like....a mouthful. And reading the part ""parents don't tell you everything"" is just so stupid like?? Sure but kids don't tell their parents everything either. And for valid reasons that he clearly don't understand.
You are a KING, Bucky. Don’t you EVER forget that!
Drop him like a hot potato. Congrats on being you ❤️
Big thumbs up for your sis. 👍🏽👍🏽
Aren't those rates hes on about more a problem for people who are forced to not come out and he them selves?
Your dad seems like he's deep in denial and refuses to accept yourself being happier than you used to be in the past. You have no obligation to fulfill what he wants because he just thinks about himself, and doing so would make you unhappy. He's egoistic and manipulative, and him being left by his family members was self-inflicted, but he doesn't want to admit that, as it's easier to shift blame on someone else.

His mention of suicide rates is completely off, and it's related to the opposite thing - because of people refusing to accept trans folks, or worse, disowning them.

Also good job to your sister for calling his bullshit out, glad to have parts of the family that are supportive. At this point cutting him off from everything is the best you can do, you don't owe him anything and it's his fault that he's ended like that.
Are you ok?
But... It doesn't havea suicide rate that high? That dude is a fucking idiot.
Ah yes I remember when I realized I was trans and instantly became 50% suicidal because that's obviously how that works lol
Your father want you to commit suicide like many of us.

Ps: It's 40% of trans people have suicidal ideas in their lifetime, his stat are from right wing websites.
This makes me so fucking angry. His only argument is the 50% suicide rate. If he‘d only realize that he’s the reason for it being so high.
""50% suicide rate"" yeah well mabye if you and alot of other shit heads supported your child then those numbers would drop?, It just boils my blood when people use that as an excuse
Your sister and her classmate are awesome people, sorry about your dad
""part of a movement with a 50% suicide chance""
First: As if it was your choice to be trans
Second: He's one of the reasons why people kill themselves. Parents have so much influence on their kids and when they try to force their son to live as a girl, they don't even realize how much they harm their child.
The cognitive dissonance is astronomically strong in this one. Like bro, you're the cause of the 41% suicide rate. The words you are speaking, are literally the cause.
Proud of you bro
Old people really can't handle their social media. Sorry.
this happens to me too :(
“3 of my kids/ all of my kids aren’t speaking to me anymore I have done nothing to cause this”

I’m glad your other family members support you! Best of luck on your journey !
Do... Do we have the same dad? 

But, seriously, I feel ya.
r/insaneparents
I'm so sorry.

I'm so glad your sister and the friend stuck up for you.

I am a great proponent for burning bridges with family that let you down, but I'm sad for you that it's necessary.

This mum of a trans girl is sending you love and hugs 💖
Yikes, I'm sorry your dad was such a cunt. But you don't need people like that in your life and you will find plenty of respect and love from other people as long as you love yourself. Take care comrade
Hey Bucky,

That hurt ME to read and it’s about you. I’m so sorry that he is that way. How ignorant of him. He’s using twisted facts (like the suicide rate ) and right wing extremist and TERF talking points so jumbled, it’s obvious he doesn’t even understand them. 

I think you’re better off without him in your life. I know some parents need some time to mourn our other selves, but it’s all in the intent. And this clearly isn’t a case of misgendering you by habit or accident. He’s trying to play a victim role to get sympathy and support. 

The bright spot in all this is the defense of you by your sister. I was so happy to read the added post that you have supportive people in your life.  Keep the people who show you love. Life is too short for the other kind of person
I'm too chickenshit to actually read most of what your dad said, but your sister sounds like an awesome person 💜
Parents experiencing grief in the beginning is a common thing, especially when it's dads about their ""daughters"". But man, your dad's an ignorant asshole beyond repair. You're really better off blocking him. You have the greatest sister though, so I'm glad you still have family to rely on. Good luck, my man <3
slide 2 they really said “find god”😂😂
🤐
W sister
A parent doesn't fail when they have a trans kid. A parent fails when they don't SUPPORT a trans kid. Much love and support to you as you walk your authentic path, dude!!! 🥰
Sometimes the hardest thing is disassociating yourself with awful people you’ve known your whole life. Just remember, there are always people out there that love you for you.
I'm really glad you have a sister like that. Especially with a dad like that
i'm tired of people saying that there's a high suicide rate while they're actively telling you that you're horrible and you're not trans. like it's absolutely awful like seriously you're helping those rates go up by being such an awful person about it. 
sorry i ranted about that it just really reeeeaaaallllyyyyy makes me mad
Thats not a parent that's a bully
""You wouldn't encourage them into behaviour with over a 50% suicide rate""

Actually braindead words right there
thats my parents im 17
no offence, your dad's a piece of shit
Block him! He is toxic to you! I have had to remove people from my life because of crap like this including family and the longer you leave it the more toxic they get. The rest of your family are supportive and are in your corner and god bless them for that but it won’t stop him pushing his agenda but in the end he will not know the real you and will miss out on you and that is something he will never get back. ❤️ this is just my thoughts and off my experience. Much love to you ❤️
I don't get how people like them can't see that the reason the s-word rate is so high for trans people is because of people exactly like them not being accepting  of their own children, it takes a huge emotional toll and I wish they could see that
Holy shit. I'm sorry, Bucky. My mom is cut from this cloth and I don't wish it on anyone. I hope you're happy despite the harrasment. And yes, definitely time to block, I think.
The only reason we have a high suicide rate is cause if people like him that try to repress us
Honestly alot of your dad's comments echo the same toxic sentiments my family have been gas lighting me with since I came out in february.

You have absolutely wonderful siblings, and clearly they surround themselves with equally wonderful people. 

Def. Time to block. You got this bro- cut that negativity out of your life.
[removed]
I do agree 💯
I wonder why the suicide rates are high… 🙄
This is always the attitude of the people on the political right: “how this affects ME”. Zero consideration that this is a human being’s entire life being discussed, we don’t want to minorly inconvenience them worth our own personal fulfilling. Lol
I'm so sorry.
""Parents don't tell their children everything"" ""that's not my child you don't know [him] I know everything about [him]""

Bro seriously needs to read up on the word ""hypocrisy"" because damn.
OP, my sister in arms and/or knighthood, with all due respect, your dad seems like a tool.
w siblings L father
The way he used the suicide statistic to help him pisses me off so much
he's beyond horrible. i'm so sorry bucky.
Damn what a hissy fit from dad, I'm sorry you had to deal with him.
Glad you have people backing you up on this.
Also just want to say, love your name.
Good on you for sticking to your ground. I’m glad that at least someone is in your corner. ☺️
r/insaneparents
I have something verry similar with my family ""we like you"" ""we respect"" and ""we just think thoses things shouldn't exist"" yhea i see that they are REALLY loving when they say thoses thing, or my father saying to my face that i am an abomination and later saye that he likes me and ""what are you doing to us""
*puts hands together in prayer fashion, moved to lips. Inhales, then exhales before pointing hands to you while still together*

Please don't take offense to this, because it is completely out of love for you:

That person is not your father. I don't care if I'm a trans-woman, I will be your father now, and I couldn't be any prouder of you and your amazing sister. And if anyone gives you shit, point me in the right direction and I will still go ""papa bear"" on them, because you deserve love and support, even if I don't fit the mold to be a ""father figure"". 😊

Be true to you; I'm proud of you.
Listen to me, it looks very very bad now, terrible, and listen to me you still have worth man. You are a man just like everyone else. You’re perfect the way you are and it’s going to be hard for a little bit but he WILL possibly come around (mine did) but don’t sit and twiddle ur thumbs and try to convince him. If your sister is in your corner appreciate it but don’t use her to feel happy again, put your head down and put focus into becoming the best version of urself and chasing any goals and dreams you have. It’ll be okay
Wow, I’m so sorry OP. Fuck that man, he’s not your dad he’s a sperm donor and that’s all… I’m glad your siblings have your back
Wat a prick
Sorry your dads being a jerk. I’m glad to see some stand up for you though! Hope your day is good.
I about to have a very “civil” conversation with you dad (by civil I mean I’m gonna yell at him for a good 2 hours until he gets it into his head that he’s so fucking wrong)
I love the casual“you need Jesus”
You’re not under *any* obligation to put up with that sort of shit, you don’t owe him “grace”, nor do you owe him education. That’s shit he needs to work o it on his own.

You owe yourself protection for yourself.

I’m sorry - you deserve better.
I love you. I'm glad you're here. Happy pride month.
So sorry you have to go through this! Sounds like your dad just wants to stay ignorant to have something to be mad about, if he truly cared about you he'd educate himself on trans people as much as possible. It's really sad this is so common, the way he acts is literally why so many trans people can't ever be themselves.

As another trans guy (closeted to family because homophobia), absolute condolences to you my dude.
So true. I'm sorry you're going through something similar. On one hand, he makes it easy to justify cutting him out. On the other, it took me 3 days to gather the emotional strength to even read any of what he said, and it hurts 🤕
 I KNOW RIGHT. He brings it up like 2 or 3 times and someone even pointed this out to him and he still somehow doesn't get it lmfao it's so weird how people like him genuinely think being trans dooms you to suicide lmao 

I'm not even inclined to do that and have never given my parents a reason to think so. Back in highschool when I knew something was wrong mentally, I asked me parents to take me to the docs and therapy. So they know I advocate for my own mental health. Now the reason I want to go to therapy again is to specifically work on issues my dad has caused. Very ironic lol but he wouldn't understand since ofc he is so perfect and knows me so well
I have a very conservative neighbor. She asks me questions about my son a lot- it might seem weird to some but she's friendly and has never treated my son with anything but respect, she's just reallly conservative. I welcome her questions because I kind of feel like if I can help educate people that's the least I can do to help out. 

This topic came up and I told her to think that through- ostracizing trans kids just when they really need their parents might be a reason more than the decision to be who they are. I think I gave her something to think about.
Not just whether they're out or not, but whether or not they even *know* at the time. I didn't figure it out until the week before my 34th birthday, but if I had tried to take my life in the decades of dysphoria and depression before then I'd STILL be counted as part of that now.

I'm so sorry you had to go through that but I'm glad you made it out the other side
They think you just turn trans the moment you ""do the voluntary decision to switch your gender"" because of boredom, satanic advertising is something, because

mY cHiLd WaS nOt BoRn ThIs WaY, oh you mean these signs? Solved them with beatings
Also, I read from a study somewhere that using your child/ a trans person's pronouns and name (not deadname or old pronouns), DRASTICALLY decreases the rate of suicide. Hang on, I'll pull it [the link to the study] up if I can.
Exactly!! People would not feel so inclined if they lived in a society where they were loved, accepted, and respected. Would people still attempt and commit suicide? Of course, but it would definitely be far less, and it wouldn't be because they chose to transition. 

I'm happy you're still here and able to transition ❤️❤️ I hope things are better for you 🫂
That genuinely made me laugh. I never wanted to be a boy so bad I started T last year 😩🤣🤣 

Thank you 💕🫂🫂
Like, hell, I didn't want to be non-binary when I was younger cause of internalized enbyphobia. But here I am. Whether you WANTED to be who you are now when you were younger doesn't matter. I WANTED to be a dragon or named Rainbow. Now I want to be authentic and happy. Shit changes. And people need to get over this.
Haha no worries! He ignored it anyway 🤦🏼‍♂️ of course. Ignore all the valid points and just keep spewing crap. 

The scary part is my dad is vehemently against any drugs or alcohol. He is just sober all the time and thinks like this 😭😂😂😂😂
Ah thank you so much 🥺❤️ I really appreciate this 💕 I wish this wasn't a frequent experience for us 😔 I'll keep your offer in mind 💞
No worries!! I appreciate pointing it out just in case ❤️ she was a husky and the goodest dog 🥺
I totally agree. Her kid is only 3 years old so she will not be damaged by never knowing her maternal grandfather. My mom is with a really great guy now AND my niece has a great paternal grandfather so she will not miss out or resent my sister for anything. 

And seriously the way he kept insisting he ""knows"" me is so funny. He tried to say that on the phone before too, that he knows me better than anyone. It's laughably untrue. My dad has not had a single interest in my personal life, my thoughts or beliefs in..EVER. when I was a little kid I talked to my dad all the time but he would get annoyed and say I talk way too much. So I stopped 🤷🏼‍♂️ I became my own person without him and now he's mad he's been left out 🙄 mf did it to himself!!

My sister actually UNblocked my dad so she could defend me 😂 she had to wait 48 hrs but she is gonna block him again. I plan to as well

I'm sorry youve been hurt by a paternal figure as well 😔🫂
If nothing else, I'd definitely recommend moving far away from them if it's at all possible. I'm not sure how old you are. I have way more peace of mind knowing I'm a 5 hour drive away from my dad knowing he will never put that much effort into driving that far to Do Something
Thank you so much 🥺❤️❤️❤️ I actually have panic disorder that I inherited from my dad. He has been on the same meds for like decades and they probably aren't doing it for him. He has major mood swings and has always been an incredibly angry person that needs to be in constant control. I wish he would seek therapy, but he's nearing 60 and I just don't see him ever resigning to it :/ either way, I'm going to separate myself from him for the time being but this does hurt me a LOT more than I'd like it to. 

And even though I know it, thank you for saying it isn't my fault 😭 I didn't respond to any of these comments and yet I still feel I need to personally apologize to the op for his behavior even though I didn't say a single thing to him to inspire this.
She does! And thank u 🥺
So tru 💪😤
Thank u sm 🥺🥺🫂 dw a lot of my friends have been saying a lot of Not So Nice Things about my dad 😂 and they have been long before I came out as trans. He just really Sucks. I always knew this was going to end up as the breaking point for me. It felt different when he still didn't know who the real me was. Now I can see he is always to reject all of me, and that sucks.


That being said, I'm actually REALLY thankful I wasnt born cis. I can't imagine what type of person I would be if my dad raised me as a boy and his only son 😬
Idk if you read them but someone mentions it in the screenshots and he just flat out ignores it but then brings up the (not even accurate) statistic again 😑
He does and u can be offensive about it 😂
Yes you're very correct. I have a lot of wonderful and amazing friends as well. This does pain me, but in my case I don't feel driven to any type of self harm. I just like putting my dad on blast as a means to cope LMAO I have tried to explain the reasons for several trans statistics but they all just go in one ear and out the other 😑
I'm sorry to hear that 😔 I wish this wasn't a common experience for us 🫂
LMAO OMG YOURE RIGHT I didn't even think about that! 😂😂😂😂😂 

It will be such a huge relief tbh my dad has been a constant stressful looming presence I just can't have hanging over me anymore
Thanks!! When I initially came out he was like... Completely fine with it. And for a hot minute I DID think maybe I did overreact? Cause I spent YEARS mentally preparing for the inevitable fall out and even joked I wouldn't know what to do if he didn't disown me lol 

Now it almost feels like he did that JUST to gas light me long term. Cause my dad for most of my life has constantly berated me for being too sensitive, angry and constantly over reacting 🙄
It was all for uniquely different reasons too 😭 My dad is like conspiracy theorist Republican, like, I'm sure you know what I mean. 

My sister is very much a centrist, so I was actually a bit worried she might not fully accept me. I was really shocked and touched by what she said here. My sister doesn't really comment or get offended by my dad's views, she just hates him for being a shitty dad, which is valid. 

My oldest sibling, however, cut my dad off because he picked a fight (on Facebook lol) over politics during the George Floyd protests. 

For me this was all worthy of cutting him off but I'm kinda glad he gave me a good reason. I was too afraid to just randomly block him out of fear of what he'd say or do but he made it easy here. He is delusional but I have to think on some level he can't possibly think after saying all this that I would be like ""oh haha dear old dad! I'll come visit next week!""? Like ??? C'mon bro. 

Sorry if this is TMI or anything. I keep word vomiting in the comments. You can probably tell I'm just trying to justify myself 😅 this whole situation just really sucks.
Ah don't think yourself as a traitor! You just happen to be really lucky and that's a good thing I'm happy for 🙂 it's saddening to see how many people relate to this post so it's actually comforting to know there's someone who doesn't but cares nonetheless. We are all in this together no matter what ❤️ thank you for this comment 💞
MAN im sorry dear 🫂 in our case I'm glad we have at least SOME family on our side ❤️
The ""I told you so"" is more important to those people than the actual lives of their children because then they get to be right and get to be the victim.
LEGIT he's such a fucking weirdo honestly
Thank you ❤️❤️❤️❤️
I'm sorry to hear that:( many hugs 🫂
For real 🙄🙄 thank u 💖
Oh same to you 🥺💕 please stay safe 🫂 That sounds really scary 😔

I am very lucky for all the people and things I do have. This is a struggle but as far as being trans, I'm actually very happy and confident. I just have bad anxiety but I'll be getting help soon
IKR 😭 and the bit about ""protecting them from themselves"" I am 25 goddamn years old. I am a whole ass adult who is free to do whatever I please. It's not like I'm a 3 year old sticking my fingers in electrical sockets. He can't control my actions forever 🙄
Thank you 🤧💕
Thank you so much for saying this ❤️❤️ I really appreciate it 🥺 and it's lovely to meet you too 💞
Thank you 🥺 ur absolutely right. Protecting me doesn't mean denying my own identity 😑
Uhm absolutely the fuck not. They didn’t just disappear when the world progressed they actively made the choice to continue to be horrible “people”. Seriously where the fuck did you get the audacity to say shit like this.

His father is a bad person, and that’s a fact.
Yes, both my older siblings have severed contact with my dad and neither of them are LGBT like me. My sister who commented is married to a man with her own kid and lives a very traditional life and even shares some of my dad's political views. He is just simply a bad father whose always emotionally berated us and our mom. He wasnt physically abusive...much. he always blamed it on his own bad upbringing and insisted allowing us to live in his home and eat his food meant he was a good dad. But there is so much more to being a good parent than being a provider. We needed a father who loved us unconditionally, taught us things, and supported us. He just didn't do that. 

It just happens for me that this is my final straw, but I'm not severing contact purely because he doesn't accept me being trans. However I still think that's a valid reason anyway because I do not want to spend the rest of my life constantly justifying my own existence to my parent
There is no old me I'm still the same. I just go by a different name and pronouns. My personality is still the same, which is what my dad should love me for
I agree. And I'm glad my siblings and I have stuck together against our dad instead of letting him turn us against each other. It makes cutting him off easier knowing I'm not the only one
IKR I don't think he rereads any comment or text he's ever sent, or thought it through 😭

I'm happy your exploring yourself but I'm sorry it doesn't feel like you can talk to anyone. I know it may seem hard but there are some wonderful people online who can really help give support 💗 my online spaces contributed a LOT to me realizing I'm trans and wanted to start HRT. Stay strong ❤️🫂🫂🫂
I can't understand it either 😔 this isn't the first time Ive been genuinely at a loss bc of something horrible my dad said or did to me. But hopefully this will be the very last time
You mean my sister's? It was a really good reply haha
Ajsjhwb ethank you sm 🥺🥺😭💓💕💞💗💖🫂
Same here dude. I'm very thankful for my sister too 💕
I KNOW RIGHT I honestly don't know what point he was trying to make there?? 😂😂 It sounded like he was saying he purposely withholds info and makes stuff up but it's only right when HE does it. Idfk tho lmao 

And ty, I'm living in a very progressive state/area now and am called Bucky and he/him at work by everyone :) I actually think there is a trans femme person at my new job bc she told me her pronouns were she/they and asked mine too. It's so awesome to have this be a new normal for me ❤️
HELL YEAH 💪🤴🏼 ty 💞
Thank you for saying this ❤️❤️ at times like these its genuinely helpful to have so many people validate my feelings and help free me from the guilt I feel for blocking him. Next step is therapy lmfao 😂💕
Im doing better now with all this mind blowing support ❤️ ty for asking
LMAO YEAH I love how he chose a higher scarier sounding number lol what if im the 50% who ISNT suicidal? 🤨 What then ?? 🧐
I have SO MANY icky memories from childhood about my parents saying and doing things that made me extremely uncomfortable but felt like I couldn't say anything. Im realizing now many of my sorta ""core"" memories were moments were I felt dysphoric. In my dad's mind, because I never told them about all these feelings that meant I just never had them

I will genuinely never understand how you can have such little interest in a person and then suddenly claim to know all their thoughts and feelings and going as far as calling them a liar when those feelings are voiced 🙄
My favorite part was when he said me moving away for my SAFETY was actually me knowing what I'm doing is wrong and that I'm embarrassed 🙃 like yeah ur right I'm embarrassed to be related to such a bigot 😂
🥺🤧💓💖💕💞
It's crazy how they aren't embarrassed to say stuff like this in front of everyone they know lmao
I'm so sorry :( much love and hugs 🫂🫂
He's so dumb fr 😂😂 thank you!! 💕
Oof big hugs cause it's ROUGH:( 🫂🫂🫂
Thank you sm mum 🥺🫂💖💖
Thank you for this comment 💖💖

I can confidently say that he has been recently getting deep into the Republican narrative against trans people with a touch of TERF. He suddenly started using their very specific language, such as texting one of my friends that I was ""mutilating"" myself. He definitely wouldn't have said that if he didn't read it somewhere. 

And yes, this isn't a case of me being annoyed by small things. I have answer every question he's had and assured him to HIS satisfaction that I thought this through and nothing huge was permanent with HRT that I didn't absolutely want. I haven't even CONSULTED about ANY surgery so it's not even like I just got top surgery and he's sad cause my tits are gone lol 

I've also sent him a TON of resources and gave him the benefit of the doubt by saying myself he was just having a hard time. But then of course this confirmed he is a victim so I kinda regret but also I don't because I can block him knowing EYE did everything the way Republicans and TERFs say I should, by being nothing but kind. I didn't want there to be a chance of a legitimate claim that I was being that angry trans person who cuts off the head of anyone that misgenders him haha

This is not to say that people are wrong for their feelings, I'm just a people pleaser and I just try to be nice. I'm not always nice tho haha anyways this is a long comment AJAJSJS I have a hard time staying concise on reddit because I'm always compensating for the fact that no one will know or remember me between posts 😂😂 I'm so not used to this haha
That's totally fair please take care of yourself ❤️❤️ I myself didn't read all his comments for a few days. The only reason I did was keep my resolve about blocking him tbh. But I was very happy to read what my sister said 🥺
LMAO YEAH!! also how convenient for my dad to say he has Jesus and Jesus agrees with him LMFAO funny because my mom was the religious one who always took us to church. My dad ain't never went!! Mf is the one going to hell here 🤣
EXACTLY! Thank you so much you're a sweetheart 🌸❤️
Me too 💗
It's ok!! You are very justified in feeling that way! It's a super annoying talking point they ALWAYS default to. I wonder what statistics I could pull up for lonely old angry white men dying young and alone 🤔😂😂  seriously though. You can make anything sound bad with statistics, especially if you never bother to think of their implications. It's a weakass argument but people are still falling for it. It's VERY frustrating
RIGHT 😭 like any trans person has ever gotten on hrt and surrounded themselves with love and support and went ""this is the very thing that makes me want to die"" lmfao my dad has -10 braincells
I'm sorry to hear that:( I hope you are able to find a safe space when you are a bit older ❤️❤️🫂🫂
Thank you sm!! ❤️ I actually did block him on FB and his phone number as well 👍 he doesn't really have any other way to contact me but I suspect I will be hearing about things via family members. We'll see how that goes. Bless u and much love to you as well 🫂
Same. It kinda sucks he ignored the person who pointed this out to him in the screenshots 😔 but he has always flat out ignores valid arguments
MAN sorry your mom sucks too 😭 this is tough but I did block and I'm still very happy with the person I've become :-) big hugs from me to u 🫂
I did it!! I blocked FB and phone number last night. Thank you for offering me strength 💪 I'm sorry this is happening to you. I hope things get better for you and you find peace 🫂
Nah my dad ain't respecting me so I'm not gonna respect him 🤷🏼‍♂️
LMAO IKR they are always so selfish ""but what about ME 🥺"" it's especially ridiculous considering my father put in 0 effort to be an active presence in my life. It's not as if we had a super loving and close relationship before this
IKR he doesn't make any sense 😂 honestly a lot of his comment I was just going 🤨 HUH??
He definitely is
Same 🙄 I hate knowing me coming out as trans just says ""I'm suicidal"" to some people because I am not!
Aw thank you!! 🥺❤️ I love my name too and it's really cool to have a bunch of people commenting with it 💕💕
Me too 🥺
Ajsjdjeje this is very cute and precious and made me smile a lot 🥺🥰🥰🥰🥰 thank you so much for saying this for real :') ❤️🧡💛💚💙💜
Thank you!! 🥺❤️
> nor do you owe him education.

I'd say if a friend or family member genuinely cares about you and is just grossly misinformed but trying to learn in good faith, by all means help them learn before they end up ""learning"" from dubious sources. But if someone goes off the rails on a transphobic tirade, fuck them.
You are right and I appreciate it ❤️ I have a tendency to show way too much patience and care for people who dont deserve it haha and a lot of that is because of the way I had to act to keep my dad from getting angry at me. So I have a hard time not translating that online *especially* reddit I feel like I really have to over explain myself so people are mean to me or something lmao ik it's dumb/pointless cause they will be mean anyway
I love u too 🥺🥺❤️🧡💛💚💙💜🤎🤍
Much love to you 🫂

I've sent him Sooo many resources including links, YouTube videos and mercury stardust's tiktoks (I love her 💖) And Im pretty sure he didn't read or watch any of them:/ or if he did, he consumed it in bad faith. 

I was closeted for a very long time before it was safe for me. My dad doing this confirmed I was right to follow my gut and wait until it was safe. I hope you also come to that point soon 💞
I been seeing my folks less and less intentionally. Hearing them is exhausting. It's a mood.

Seems familiar 🤔
https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/ (study link)

""Researchers[Study](https://news.utexas.edu/2018/03/30/name-use-matters-for-transgender-youths-mental-health/) interviewed transgender youths ages 15 to 21 and asked whether young people could use their chosen name at school, home, work and with friends. Compared with peers who could not use their chosen name in any context, young people who could use their name in all four areas experienced 71 percent fewer symptoms of severe depression, a 34 percent decrease in reported thoughts of suicide and a 65 percent decrease in suicidal attempts.""

""[Earlier research](https://cns.utexas.edu/news/victimization-of-transgender-youths-linked-to-suicidal-thoughts-substance-abuse) by Russell found that transgender youths report having suicidal thoughts at nearly twice the rate of their peers, with about 1 out of 3 transgender youths reporting considering suicide. In the new study, having even one context in which a chosen name could be used was associated with a 29 percent decrease in suicidal thoughts. The researchers controlled for personal characteristics and social support.""

So if you don't want your trans child to commit unalive, use their pronouns and new name. Don't deadname.
yeah transphobes ignore anything that don’t go along with their beliefs. i think there was a study where homophobia and transphobia was often linked with low intelligence
I hope the frequency of it lessens as your father grows. I’ll be here if you need to talk, that’s a promise
Old habits die hard- the OP in your post may be more worried about you than themselves.  I don't think you need to apologize, but maybe reach out and say 'I see this really sucked for your perfectly innocent thread. I just want to check in and make sure we're okay."" or something like that.

My dad is very similar and while he's undiagnosed I'm certain he has depression and anxiety issues- all of his kids do, whether or not we were raised with him. When my son became my son, my dad insisted on confusing comfort with respect. As a result he's not in our lives anymore. My dad had a pretty rough upbringing, but he's an adult now and deserves the consequences of his actions in all things, just like yours does. You're not the one making things difficult. Keep your chin up- you're going to get the last laugh here.

&#x200B;

Edited to add- Sorry, you didn't ask for advice- old habits die hard for me too. I'll leave it there, I don't believe in erasing mistakes so much as learning from them.
You're welcome I get it my parents don't get me either. They deal with me but they don't fully support me use name pronouns so it's a pain in the ass.
Oh yes hugs are nice 🫂
HA! Well as far as trans perks go, that's definitely is pretty high up there! Maybe that was a way for the universe to be kind to you. :)
Yeah, I didn’t realize there was more than one 😂
You have a good head on your shoulders. Keep doing what you do King 💜
So do I. If you ever need someone to talk to feel free to message
Yeah, tbh he sounds like an emotional liability—the kind of person who you keep attached simply to give them the opportunity to prove they arent shitty or prove they can change, and in the end its just excuse after excuse, holding your breath until the next disappointment… it is better to go ahead and shut it down now. He has made his priorities crystal clear, and that is that his kids are not among them.
People are horrible.
You have nothing you *need* to justify, and your dad has nothing he *can* justify. This whole thing he has created is both sad and tragic. I'm just sorry you have to deal with it. No parent should treat their child like this.
Exactly this. My dad has ALWAYS had the ""I'm always right and the victim"" mentality my whole life 🙄 he wants to predict bad things happening to his children in hopes that WHEN they do, we'll go ""you were right dad!:/"" Idk how I can tell him he's right if I'm dead tho LMAO ig he thinks my demise is inevitable and my siblings will come crawling back  to him. It's never going to happen though. If I end up dead it will be because of something out of my control
Well, its great that your getting help, and that you're happy with yourself. I am personally happy with myself as well, being Aro/Ace/Agender. But the friends I have are probably the only good thing outside of my ownself. But thanks for the well wishings, it means a lot.
I don’t know who he thinks he is telling you that you “never wanted to be a boy” as if it’s a choice. I don’t know what’s up with him, but he needs to get his brain checked or something cause he’s completely brain dead.
No problem my fellow dude bro, we're all made in God's image and this is you fulfilling that image, not making some arbitrary choice like the prick your stuck calling a father seems to think. And whether you believe in God or not isn't important to me, but thats how I feel about all LGBTQIA+ people living out as their true selves. If you're happy, then you're fulfilling God's image of you. Continue to be the awesome, handsome guy you are, and much love from me to you!
Thanks for defending me ❤️ he genuinely is a bad person like, beyond these screenshots.
First off, chill. Second off that’s quite the black/white way of seeing things. Nobody wakes up and goes “hehe time to be evil today”, everyone has their points of view and misguided notions about the world, my father is also a biggot but I understand where he comes from, an extremely religious and primitive upbringing. Nobody is perfect and rarely people are 100% in control of themselves and their thoughts and so I’ve been working with him for years and surely enough he opens up more as time goes because before all he simply acts the way he does out of concern and love. Showing zero empathy like you are now is no better than the way OP’s father acts in my opinion. Only love and understanding will lead to love and understanding.
I can understand and relate. I have a similar experience- you do what’s best for you. I do hope your father develop his senses one day and make amends
[removed]
Stay strong, I believe in you ❤️

It's not easy 😔
I mean to your dad... from me :)

I just didn't want to point out directaly, that he's your dad.
Im here and ill help when I can 💗
No that's impossible, obviously every single trans person has a 50/50 chance of committing suicide no matter what xD
🤜
🫂💖
I agree, this is definitely not a case of being annoyed by small things. You’ve gone above and beyond. I mean texting your friends to complain about you? He honestly believes that he’s going to recruit them and turn them against you? Bucky, as a parent of two grown people. I would never dream of that. I love my kids unconditionally, and all I want for them is to be happy. It’s horrifying that he would do this. I see the hurt in your post. You’re justified in how you feel. 

When one told me they were Bi, I hugged them and told them to find whoever made them happy. I said that there’s not enough love in this world, and that however they decided to share that love was going to make the world better. It didn’t matter if they got married or not, had one significant other or several. I would always love and support them. 

You’ve tried. You really have. But his actions are wrong. It shouldn’t matter what you’ve done medically. He doesn’t have the right to make your decisions for your body. Which the republican narrative tries to assert. Their narrative needs to really re-examine their hypocrisy…They screamed you don’t have the right to make me wear a mask, but they can’t possibly move fast enough to try and block healthcare for women or transgender youth. These are the people who scream what about the children, but with the school shootings go out of their way to defend their guns instead of the children. 

I’m rather long winded here also. You have my support, and I guess I could have just said that. But I hope you know, that by my long response that I believe that you have done everything you could. And it’s now time to stop allowing him to hurt you. But my final word is you’ve already proven yourself a better human, and a better man than he ever was or ever will be. Go and let yourself enjoy this life. It’s too short to allow him to drag you down into his swamp of misery.
Exactly
❤️❤️❤️
It just supports their persecution complex
I just realized that I meant brother in arms and in knight hood, I might not have half a braincell.
Even then you don't owe them anything. It's a good thing and nice to educate them, but they're not entitled to a trans person, be it a friend, family member or stranger, explaining anything to them. It's okay to not have the energy to explain things. It's okay to set a boundary because it would be re-traumatising to have to explain why the things they say or think are wrong. It's okay to not want to put up with it. Offering education to those willing to learn is great, but it's not mandatory. You don't **owe** it to them
Good vs bad faith was actually the main thing I brought up with each of my parents. All I asked of them was to just listen to me and ask questions *in good faith.* I did try really really hard and did a lot of research FOR my dad and sent him all the links. He just ignored all of it. Plus he has always asked questions in bad faith. My answers never mattered to him because he already made up his mind 😔

And I'm confident in this because my mom was really upset with me at first but she maintains good faith and has even started educating her own peers. My dad would NEVER
I totally get that. I tend to do the same, myself - it’s taken me a long time to recognise that the way my parents treated me wasn’t okay, and that I needed better boundaries
I also love your username. I assume it's IASIP related?
It's honestly really sad they don't even bother reading scientifically proven articles. Just really proves that some people would rather hate people than try to be a better person. You're pretty damn strong to be able to put up with your literal dad treating you like this!

&#x200B;

Thanks! Probably won't be able to come out until I'm over 18, but sadly I know they won't support me (but probably won't disown me, at least before I take t) so I'll have to figure out how to get a t prescription myself :').
Luckily I moved to a state where none of my family lives, so I don't see them often. My dad claims I did that cause I'm embarrassed. Yah embarrassed of how bigoted y'all are 😂😂😂
Don't worry about it haha I appreciate your insight a lot 🥺❤️ I didn't even pay attention to your flair at first hwheje its nice to know there are cis parents here looking out for us, for me 🥺🥺🥺💕
My mom has been slow to get there but she's getting there. I don't expect my extended family to ever get it though. Maybe when I get top surgery and grow a beard they'll feel awkward enough but who knows. they don't seem to take it seriously
That's what I chose to believe tbh 🥺 I probably would have been an asshole for a while and would've had a really strained relationship with my older siblings. My dad is very misogynist but he would say ""old fashioned"" but I also would have been gay AF so who knows what would have happened tbh. I am still going to view it as a kindness because I think I've grown up to be a good person 👉👈
Thank u cutie 🥺💕
Thank you ❤️🌺
You're right. Ive been doing the holding my breath until the next disappointment for too many years to wait any longer. Every single family member whose known my dad since before I was born all agree...he will NEVER change.
Thank you for your kind words 🥺💕💕🫂
Also because it's not like I grew up saying ""I never want to be a boy!"" ?? 😂😂 My dad legit would get worried if I cut my hair too short or dress like a boy. Now he wanna pretend like I've been an ultra femme womanly woman all along 🙄😂
Thanks for being so respectful and kind :-) I am no longer religious but I respect your views and am happy to know you believe in something so wonderful 💞
It’s the least I can do, I know what you mean. You deserve infinitely better, and don’t let assholes like that get to you. You, and you alone, can decide if something is bad enough.
These people constantly harm others. They don’t deserve empathy. 

And really, because I make the true statement that bigots are evil, I’m *no better than them*? Lmao shut the fuck up. Queer people didn’t just appear all of a sudden. We have always existed.

Bigotry exists out of lack of empathy and a refusal to learn, not the inability. “Love and understanding” is bullshit. These people want us dead, there is no love and certainly no understanding. “Yeah I get it you think I’m an abomination and want me dead, that’s valid, but maybe don’t do that?”.

If we continue to be weak against these “people” we’ll never be free. No progress has ever been achieved by kindly asking your oppressors to please stop. Being nice to them does nothing more than limit our progress to actual freedom. 

I hope you become a good person and deconstruct the bigotry you clearly have left in you from your upbringing
I see you've commented on my post several times but they keep getting deleted. Are you my dad? Lmao if you're not I suggest to stop being so obsessed with me and leave me alone ❤️
Lmao what, I hope you come back to reality one day, if not, I’ll be enjoying the fact you will suffer endlessly in the next life <3
Ohh gotcha!
OHH right right that 50/50 shot 🤣
🥺🥺🥺🥺 I'm actually really happy for your lengthy reply ❤️❤️ you're a really lovely person 💕 I'm glad other people can see I've put in the effort. it just helps to be validated and reminded I'm doing the right thing

You're a wonderful parent your kids are very lucky to have you 🙂💗💞
Haha no worries!
Yes!! 🥰
Thank you 🥺

I'm not sure where you live ofc but luckily resources like the trans reddits are great ways to figure out where and how to get your T. Some US states do informed consent so it's a matter of talking to a doctor and having them write your script. I myself have been using plume until I can find a doc who will write my scripts instead of the plume service
Heh yeah I finally figured out how to set my flair.. A LOT of the early posts I posted in this subreddit are ""Hi there, I'm a (cis) mom to a (trans) son"" ha ha

And you're totally worth looking out for. Buy your sister a drink (coffee, adult beverages, a soda, whatever) next time you see her, she's a keeper. And if you need parental perspective, feel free to send me a dm, or whatever it is the kids call it these days. Christ I'm old.. :D
Yeah it's the opposite for me it's like the less people knew me pre coming out the easier it is for them the longer they knew me before it's like brutal. I'm in my 30s. So I'm kinda like eh this is what it is they can't stop me and I can't change them.
You're welcome 😊💜
Of course ❤️🫂
I don’t know who he thinks he is saying “this isn’t your true self” like dude, yes it is. Since when does he get to make the decisions on who your true self is? Anyways, go tell your dad to suck a fat cock. (Hope you don’t take offense to that)
We should all be kind and respectful at the bare minimum, regardless of our views on the subject, hell that's what the Bible teaches us, but people have twisted and perverted its words to fit their ideas. Hopefully one day religion as a whole can go back to what it should've always been. A loving accepting home for those in need of one. But I digress and end my rant. And since I'm unsure if you have heard this recently. I love you man. You are loved.
Jesus to the holy Christ. There isn’t enough time in the day to unpack all of this and you don’t seem open to discussion at the moment so I’ll just say this few things. these “people” are our friends and family - normal people, not a KKK-style clan of biggots. They aren’t cordinated in their stupidity. Instead of aiming for a war with them you should aim to help them understand. There is such a thing as blunt education when things go too far but here we are in 2022 - where being ourselves becomes more celebrated with each passing day thanks to the hard work of countless people who acted kindly and intellectually through years of hardship out in the real world, not thanks to angry people arguing on social networks. 2, hate and anger only leads to more hate and anger which you seem to be full of. I don’t know your story or circumstances but you don’t know mine either and what I’ve been through. But I’ll tell you as someone who was surrounded by hatred their entire life and still is - just writing people off as evil is the simple way out. Aiming for mutual understanding is not ״bigotry from my upbringing”. It’s a strength I’ve acquired because of it. I don’t categorize myself as a “good person” and I don’t aim to be one because such thing doesn’t exist. You’ll do good things in your life and bad things, the goal is to be our best self we can be.
Marry me.
Np!

Thank you so much! That really helps a lot! I'll look up the guidelines for my state right now!
Thank you sm 💞💞 I really appreciate it and will keep it in mind 🥺💕
Thank you 🥺❤️ I'm case you haven't heard it either you are loved too! 💕
Alright so you just don’t actually care about change. They’ve had their entire lives to learn, they haven’t, that’s on them.

And there certainly is a thing as a good person, but I’m glad you recognize you aren’t one.

May the Gods help the people around you
OKAY! 😍💍💒
The fact you categorize me as a bad person because my opinion is different than you even though we both aim for the same goal speaks volume. You are being extremely mean but again I don’t know what’s behind your words so I won’t retaliate. You also don’t seem 
to even care about what I’m saying so communication is meaningless - I wish you a wonderful day, week, year and life my friend. I hope you find peace
Done. No take backsies.
You’re defending bigots and telling someone not to blame their abusive family for being abusive. That makes you a bad person.
Where did I do either of those things?
Your original comment"	v8tuic	trans	1337	0.99	2022-06-09 23:23:46
The owner of GayPrideShop UK, the largest LGBTQ+ store in the UK, told me to get used to being misgendered.	"This is a cross-post from r/transgenderuk
I've read the rules, but I'm not clear on the etiquette, so I'm sorry if I have not followed correctly. 

When i worked there from June - December, customers often misgendered me, but during halloween, when it was particularly busy, it happened a lot more. One guy looked me right in the eyes, and at the huge ""She/Her"" patch on my beanie and said ""see ya later fella"", which, obviously, made me feel disgusting. I told the owner of the store about this, and he said the exact words:

""you'd better get over it, because I make most of my money this time of year"".

He said that to me at the start of the first day of the Halloween rush, and I then, for three days, served most of the customers during the rush. Almost all of them misgendered me, and this period was awful for my mental health.

My first day off after those three days, I went to my GP and was prescribed anti-depressants. This was because of a mental health crisis I was having because of what the owner had said to me. 

In November, he -actually- misgendered me, in front of a customer, who then consequently misgendered me. He'd also make light of what had happened during halloween and would double down on what he'd said. 

They appear inclusive, because they include neopronouns, and they cover a lot of different identities. But from my experience with the two owners, any support they show for trans rights is just virtue signalling. 

Anyway, sorry for the wall of text, this has sat with me for a while and I felt the need to say something."	"i feel that alot of ""lgbtq+ friendly"" companies are actually very queerphobic.
Unfortunately there is a surprisingly large amount of transphobia in the LGBTQ+ community from those who aren’t trans.
This is rainbow capitalism. Nothing about a business selling pride merch is liberators. I'm sorry you went through that OP
Well I straight-up would have told him that some people are going to need to get used to getting punched in the nose then
He wants money. I don't think he actually cares about advocating or misgendering.
I've heard of companies profiting off of pride before but an entire store DEDICATED to profiting off of pride without actually caring about LGBT people? Holy fuck.
Ugh. Where in the UK is the shop?
I swear to god this country is just the earth's butthole
I don’t support gays who don’t support me
Wtf :( I am soooo sorry to hear that.
Unfortunately alot of the ""support"" from companies regarding lgbtq+ is purely financially motivated. It's a shame they don't always care but atleast it's some progress, exposure can help normalise our culture but we still have a far way to go.
Only commenting because now they're mad so I want to get this post some karma boosting powers....
this.  this kind of shit is proof the pride flag and the term ""LGBT"" doesn't actually include transgender rights at all.
Fact is. Most people are too busy to care about anything other than their own ego….
All capitalists are bastards. They would sell out their communities for profit in a heartbeat. The “representation” they give us is just a ploy to squeeze more money out of the most exploited sections of the working class.
Terf island strikes again 😔
time to boycott
Well this is one shop to never give money to.

What really bothers me is that you mention *multiple* customers misgendering you. Why would there be any need to use gender specific terms at all? That seems malicious in intent to me.
Sorry that happened to you Estelle, I hope you’re in a much better place now.
that was brutal, they didn't even pull their punches they just went nuclear on you, like damn.
I would just misgender your boss and customers and ask them why they get mad
That’s so disheartening because they should know better. I’m sorry you went through this. Your employer doesn’t value you, they value profit. You need to work for a company that does values you, because you deserve it. Surround yourself with people who support your authentic self. It’s critical to do this when you’re trans or non-binary.
Being fair, and 100% playing devils advocate; sometimes you do just have to get used to it bc there will always be shitty people both above, below, and on the same level as you. It sucks for real, but focusing on it only hurts more.

Personally, I just decry them as dickheads who can’t be better.

Sorry about the abuse you faced, but thanks for the heads-up, I now know where *not* to shop!
You should post this to r/antiwork
like Disney they have been saying forever they are supporters then turn around and cancel all of Pixar's queer content and support the people behind the Don't Say Gay bill.
Their level of friendliness is directly correlated to how much money you have to spend with them.
That’s because companies don’t have beliefs, they aren’t people. They only have one interest: profit, and will seek this by any means necessary. “LGBT positive” companies are only using that label to commodify our community and cater to those who may be fooled by their aesthetic. The second we aren’t profitable anymore, they’ll go right back to hating us.
hannaford (a local supermarket chain) is genuinely really good though :)) im really happy they are actually super nice and just really kind..
YEP.

Capitalism is the enemy.
The bourgeois class will be liquidated someday, my trans brothers and sisters.
Despite what people say, violence sometimes IS the answer.
Odd how he did all that misgendering personally for free then

He's transphobic.
Based in Manchester, they ship globally.
Not just your country. There's a wrong way to be in every place you can go.
People in the UK tend to use gendered terms naturally, to my dismay 😅

I wore signage (sold by the store) constantly to try and get people to take a hint, the entire building is meant to be trans positive (there are signs saying ""no transphobia"" and a huge trans day of visibility mural) so I feel like it's fair to expect people to respect it.
What
Jesus Christ homegirl was just venting and warning us about this place. If you never feel shitty about this sort of thing then great for you, other people can use some support and that's perfectly OK too.
>That’s the reality of our choice.

What choice?
Choice? Just because your experience soured your outlook doesn't mean everybody has to be as jaded as you. If you need to talk, my DMs are open for all, but don't spread your misery and try bringing everyone down to how fucked up you feel inside. Jesus Christ.
sounds like someone could use some therapy and antidepressants. hope you get better soon!
Thats depressing me rn
walmart too!
I'm so fed up of these large media corporations that are just slightly ""technically not *too* big to be considered a monopoly"" limiting their creators, mainly when these limitations are because of bigotry...
In Maine? How trans-friendly is Maine in general, would you say?
Unfortunately for some people I am a scrapper more unfortunate for some people my brother is an insane person who loves to fight and will fight anyone who is transphobic. The older I get the less scrappy I've become but I will defend myself and more importantly anyone in the community. Sometimes some loud mouth transphobic jerk needs a nice jarring slap or a punch to the gut. Be safe out there everyone
Violence is never the answer!
Its the question, and the answer is always YES
it’s always a solution
The one if affleks? If so I'll avoid it and just use QueerLit
Based here in Manchester you say! Disgraceful. Have the owner come down to Wythenshawe, we'll show him a ""good time"" 😇

Side note if you're ever in need of a South Manchester friend just DM me and say hi, I myself don't know a lot of people from the community here! ^-^
That must be regional because I'm from UK and never used gendered terms to refer to people I didn't know since long before I knew about anything LGBT.
LMAO it's like tell me you have internalized transphobia without telling me you have internalized transphobia
uhhh no not maine but new england. idk abt maine but where i live is really nice honestly.
I feel this on a spiritual level.
Any time is go time, and these hands are rated E for Everyone! lol In all honesty I've lost a lot of my fight (physically) but I grew up in the ghetto so the savagery still remains if I ever need it.
It is that one yes, they actually have beef with QueerLit.
Dm me of you want a link to a Manchester based social group for 18-35 year old trans people! ^_^ it's a lovely group.
Ohh, I just looked it up and apparently hannaford’s exists outside of Maine lol. My bad. I’m in Mass and it seems pretty friendly, but I’m still scared shitless to come out tbh
All the more reason to support queer lit then!
Oh my days yes, I went there to ask about books that might help my parents get their heads round the trans of it all. They recommended the transgender issue and coming out stories, both of which my mum has now read and is helping my dad get used to gendering me correctly now 😊
Also, the staff there were lovely as it wasn't too busy so I got to have a proper good chat with the 3 people in that day. Love that place! Can't wait to move back to Manchester and get all my queer books from there 😁
I love Queer Lit! Such a genuinely nice business."	tjjrvh	trans	1332	0.99	2022-03-21 19:25:55
Got misgendered by every tsa agent!	"Just a short vent. I got my legal stuff changed back in augest, but haven’t been able to get my Id yet. Part of why I’m flying today. Well the tsa agents told me that since my only form of valid id, a child passport says [dead name] my bourding pass and luggage tags have to also. Then they only referred to me as [dead name] for the rest of going through security. 

I know there’s not much that can be done here, just wanted to vent a bit."	"I’ve found traveling difficult.  Between the staff and those body scanners
This kind of stuff pisses me off. I hated flying with my old ID. We/You deserve better than this. The policies just fly in the face of basic human dignity and they don’t care. 

I do my best to not get visibly irritated when deadnamed or misgendered at the airport, but I don’t let them off easy. Don’t settle for less dignity. Stand up to these mindless people and tell them it is unacceptable to be called anything other than your preferred identity.
*hugs*
I had a similar thing happen last year. I went through airport security and I wasn't totally passing as I just was wearing comfy travel clothes and also had cut my hair. Anyway I guess my bra went off when I went through the metal detector? 

So the male TSA agent had to do a pat down and like rubbed his hand all over my back and my bra and asked me what it was. 

I was super embarrassed and just said ""underwear"" and went on my way. He was more confused at first and I don't think it quite clicked, and then I heard him talking about it with a female coworker. 

I was pretty mortified as it was one of my first times wearing a bra in public. I'm much more confident about what I wear now but at the time it was a pretty awkward experience.
been on hrt a while. working on myself, i try to look fairly cute but who knows how it's working? anyways i was flying this last thanksgiving and after handing over my id and getting the thanks sir and right this way, after i went thru the body scanner the guy on the other side shouted out ""female! i need a female for pat down! female!"" i nearly died from happiness and validation. life does get better! don't give up 🥰
More reasons why Imma drive everywhere until I get this changed... Even if it's across the ocean, I'm driving over that shit too!
Half of this is a shitty system, the other half is shitty people. The TSA agents could have handled this better or at least used your real name when addressing you

Sorry you had to go through this, not everyone is an ass
I still get misgendered even after I got my name changed. Even when I wear a mask with my pronouns on it, I still get issues smh
That's upsetting :( I'm glad you'll be able to get things sorted soon
my parents haven’t legally changed my name even though they said they would and yesterday i had to go to the airport to go on vacation and part of the security system was for people to say your legal name out loud 
i didn’t want to say it and the security lady kept saying is *deadname* you? and i started crying 
i eventually had to deadname myself and it felt awful
It’s not like TSA even does anything anyway, which makes this total invasion of privacy and their rudeness even more infuriating
Well, obviously not much can be done since the experience already happened, but there's a lot that could and should be done to get TSA to treat people better! Do they have to collect your information using your legal name? Yes. Do they have to say it out loud? No. Do they have to misgender you? Absolutely not. They collect taxes and fees from the airlines to pay for the screening of passengers. That means that even if they're part of the Federal Government, they're providing a service that you paid for. They should be treating you and every other passenger with respect.

Hugs.
I am so sorry. The last time I took a plane ride, I got treated like a criminal just because one of those double-digit IQ dictators clocked me. The ""T"" in TSA stands for ""transphobia""
TSA is evil.
Don't take it personally. You need to have a low IQ and a desire to grope strangers in order to take a job like that. Those cretins don't matter.
That sounds pretty hard. I hope things have gotten better since.
I just started transitioning but traveling scares the shit out of me. Sorry you had to deal with that.
*hugs*
I’m sorry you went through that. I’m pretty early in my transition so I haven’t experienced that side of things yet (I make sure I don’t wear my packer on flights lol) but I have a mobility device and the TSA people can be really rude about it. 

One time they told me they needed to check it specially (since the cane pole is metal) and just held out their hand for it. When I didn’t immediately pass it over to them they got angry and started insisting I give it to them. Like, sir, I have it for a reason? You can’t just take it and expect me to be fine? They got me a rickety wooden one for a temporary replacement and when they were done checking my cane they set it aside. Then another TSA person saw it and started shouting “whose is this? Why is this here?” I was just standing there, wobbling, like uhhhhh it’s mine? Can I have it back? And they looked past me two or three times before acknowledging me (‘young ppl can’t be disabled’🙄) and giving it back. 

I’m sure once I start showing changes from T and everything it’ll be even more ‘fun’.
Tsa and all airport staff treat me Ike a criminal whenever I fly. Last time when I had to put my stuff through the scanner the person working found out I'm trans. Had an immediate tone shift and straight up threw my phone into one of the boxes. Shattered my screen protector. Then they saw my switch and did tje same. Except they also ripped off the kickstand and threw it out.
*gives you sweets* eat
I’m sorry they were idiots. Going through the airport is bad enough by itself. Being called by the wrong name and having to read  it everywhere makes it suck more.
Well at least there was no cavity search.
We’ve all been there.  Big Huggs!  It will be better one day.
We are all well indoctrinated in the bureaucracy operation. Just have to do what needs to be done.
Lol, it doesn't matter what you do as a trans woman, pink or blue scan always stops you.

Something in your pants or something in your shirt that the dumb machine isn't programmed to see there.
I have to travel for marching band in a week and a half, still haven’t changed my name yet, yay
that totally sucks, giving hug
Isnt that sort of discrimination? Or just straight up discrimination?
As some one who works in the airport (Operations) sadly they have to address you by what the legal id you have says. Its a Federal agency so every rule is followed to the T.  Has a lot to do with making sure you are who you say you are (i.e not a terrorist etc). Biometric security and identification would make it easier to just call you by what you would prefer, but still based on what legal name is in the system.

I know its a horrible feeling though.  But its not personal on the part of the Agents most likely
[deleted]
Is there a reason why you haven't had your ID updated? I feel like this was very easily avoidable
What airport?
Omg yeah I had to fly a few weeks ago and when I got in the scanner one of the agents asked the other “pink or blue” and the other one goes “oh definitely pink” really goddamn loud and I died inside
You can avoid the body scanners by getting pre-check. Very much worth it
This. This is why I'm not travelling unless I have some man to protect me.
If you walk up to the AIT (body scanner) and request to be screened as what ever gender you prefer (what ever is downstairs will make it easier for you) they must scan you that way please tell all people you know
Just fly private! I've flown dozens of times in the past couple of years, no TSA at all. Everything from hopping in a friend's Cessna to semi-private charters like JSX (flights start at like $79 each way).
^ this. I used to be very timid whenever I was misgendered/deadnamed, but in the 2 years I've been transitioning, I've grown a LOT more confident. It's worth it to correct people. Even in medical settings, I haven't had any issues with gender stuff once I say something about it. I live in a very conservative area, so it's always assumed that I'm a ""young lady"" and ""miss (deadname)"" because of my legal information (I'm FTM), but even where I live in the middle of yee-yee ass nowhere, people will listen to you if you're confident and persistent with it. After a certain point it becomes more of an annoyance to deadname/misgender you if you point it out and correct them on it every single time lol. They WILL start to get it right if you become a pain in the ass when they don't lmao.
I agree with this, except that you’re not going to convince the TSA without changing ID because American airport security is so unnecessarily tight.
Thank you
I fucking hate the body scanners now! Nearly everytime I go through, I get to hear, ""Suspicious mass at your groin. Step over here Miss. Do you want to be patted down by a man or woman""? At least I get a choice I guess... Sorry about all that for you! They need some actual training!
That’s amazing! Congrats!
Big mood there. If I could I’d be driving to
Thank you
Thank you
Thank you

I had my court date to get my name changed literally two days before I left for college, and I have to be in my home state (since it’s where my permanent address is) to get an id. That’s a big part of why I’m flying home for Xmas; so I can also get a state id
This makes me so angry.
Can you not opt out of the scanner and have a person search you instead? Not sure if that's more or less of an issue but at least you'd be able to ask for someone of your gender (hopefully your gender, not the one on your passport if different)
I've had similar experiences traveling. I'm so sorry you went through that, man. :/
OhMyFuckingGod! That’s horrible. I am so sorry that these cretins behaved like this towards you. Keep your head held high and remember who you are! Wishing you well.
i dont get how this is rude?
It just feels like extortion though. 

""Oh you don't want to be inconvenienced or humiliated? Pay up.""
Oh my god is it worth it, and the fringe benefits of pre-check... keep shoes on, don't have to take electronics out of bags... shorter lines in major airports. It is awesome.
You can also simply opt out of them. The TSA has not allowed independent testing on them for stuff like cancer risk, so you have the legal right to opt out of walking through the machine. They _will_ grope you if you do this though, so its not the greatest option for most people.
Wait do they just follow you around and keep you safe? Where do I find one? 🥺
Why stop there? Become a pilot, buy your own plane. Hell get a PhD in quantum physics and research teleportation!
JSX looks cool but doesn't go where I need to go
The TSA is just a kneejerk reaction to 9/11 that, while in some ways a good idea, was executed incredibly poorly and is in dire need of reform
God yeah I always tell them afterwards ""just send me back through the scanner as male.""
it's always my hair braid hanging wrong lol
> Do you want to be patted down by a man or woman

Wow, I never get a choice.
If you want to avoid the “suspicious mass” you can typically skip the pat down part by going through the scanner while wearing a heavy flow pad. Just make sure they’re heavy flow as the regular ones won’t work. And… may be worth mentioning that they are definitely not comfortable to wear. (I feel bad so many  vagina-havers need to resort to these) So if you have a longer flight maybe don’t try this.
you can get precheck its like a one time fee for an entire year. ive yet to do it but even b4 coming out i always was stopped cuz the body scanner flags by benign tumor on my back
would having these people touch your body be much better......................................................................................... ?
Thanks dude. This shit sucks.
It’s asking out loud for a non-work mandated confirmation of what’s under their pants; it’d be weird and rude even as a passing comment much less that.
I mean, I don’t really have an issue with the first guy so much, he was at least quiet about it but I’m a guy and the second lady basically announced to the entire airport that I don’t pass, so it felt like shit
Some airline credit cards get you it for free.
It is, but if you travel a lot (which I did for years) then it’s worth it. The first trip I made with pre check, I was going to fly home and there was an mlm/essential oils convention leaving the same day. The security line was literally looped and out the door. The wait was longer than Star Tours on opening week. I asked where pre check was. 5 minutes, and that was because I stopped to commiserate with my coworkers who had not pushed the boss for pre check.

Only trouble I had when I got it was trying to explain why my father’s trip to China was unlikely to influence me because he was dead. I don’t know why he went, either, but the agent pushed me to come up with a reason so I said “knowing dad, hookers.” His face was priceless.
It basically is the Transgender Harassment Tax, but if I ever fly again I will probably pay it to avoid having anyone touch me. Fuck the TSA.
I've had it so many times to me. They asked if i wanted a private room last time. I said ""nah i like an audience""
Can get it for free if you qualify for some credit cards
... Where are the chasers when you need them?
Like everyone can afford to fly private…
Becoming a pilot is actually pretty easy - I've done it 3x (airplane land single engine, multi engine, and rotorcraft).
Just one example that happens to be local to me, that I've flown a lot. There are countless others.
It was never well-thought out, and it was supposed to be *temporary*, until the threat was past. It’s been 20 years and things have gotten more restrictive over time.
Im so used to getting ""randomly selected"" im just used to getting my bag searched, patted down, etc, I'm over it. I was shocked the last time I flew, didn't get patted down! Then heard ""is this your bag""? 😑
On one hand, super affirming! They assumed and used the ""female"" mode, but I get even more attention than I used to. Apparently I'm as suspicious in a skirt as I was bearded and chubby 😂.
Well damn... That's rude! Having a choice was nice at least
cant get anything like that in the UK. everyone gets security. but you can always request a manual search instead of a body scan.
For anyone reading this in the USA you can also get global access. It's a bit of a process and requires you to go in person to a federal agency but afterward you can just enter an id number and always be approved for precheck and easier times coming into the country. It lasts for four years.
4 years*
I mean, we all have various levels of discomfort to that idea. Anyone that's had to do it for me was quick and I'm fine with any professional touching me pretty much fucking anywhere if it's necessary for their job. And I do mean anywhere, as long as it's very professional context.
i guess it depends. if they need to do more than a pat down they will take you into a private room at least.
Absolutely! And right out loud. That goes beyond rude.
ah okay, i didnt mean to sound rude
""free"" as long as you accept our borrowing/lending service and give us full access to your personal data.
I get it. I'm dreading the next time I fly. But saying ""Fuck the TSA"" and then turning around and handing them $85 is really saying ""Keep up the good work!"" and  *literally helping fund their shitty practices.*
My dad is cis and gets it everytime. I have trans friends who have no issue with TSA. I pass pretty well but due to my genetic disorder I get flagged guess should I should call it the ""NF Harassment Tax"" with that logic
Did you read what I posted?! JSX is priced on par with Southwest flights, so are ""scheduled 135"" operators like Advanced Air...

And not ever dealing with TSA: Priceless.
It's worth it if you travel a decent amount, maybe just once a year. I've been too lazy but it's been on the list. Every coworker I've had the last few years recommends it, if you're okay with something like $200 per year or whatever.

There's two common ones, I think the global one is the better one?
wat..............
You're doing that anyways and giving away your information already, so milk all the bonuses you can get.

Prison pocket if there is suspicion but all they do is back of the hands glide. And will tell you where hands go before they go there.

>Like it's easy to say ""don't give money to people that you're ethically against"" but I mean genuinely, what does it accomplish?

True or not, don't you find this to be completely soul crushing? I hate feeling completely helpless and ineffective in this world. I'd rather do *something* instead of nothing at all.

>If you really want them to stop existing, you're gonna have to put in a lot more work than that.

I completely agree. And I don't know what I can *actually* do to make a difference, so for now I'll do the only thing I know and just not give them my money.
Upvote for prison pocket in a serious discussion
I agree that it might be considered cowardly for me to say ""Fuck the TSA"" and then give them money, but they are a huge, laughably huge organization with billions of dollars. They won't crumble because I don't give them my $85 and I don't want them to palpate my crotch again because the metal zipper on my blue jeans might have been a weapon. I don't give my money to Amazon either because I can buy all the trash they sell anywhere else. If I want to leave the US and never come back I will either have to fly or find a boat. When it comes to the TSA I feel like I don't have a choice.

I don't like any of this either and any decision about this feels like coercion of one kind or another."	rj944q	trans	1269	0.95	2021-12-18 14:56:05
AITA (honestly please) for getting offended	"I get offended a lot by my mom especially, because she recently told me that I'm mentally ill for seeing myself as a boy (I'm AFAB). 
On some days I think I pass pretty well, and at school everyone initially gendered me as male before they heard my dead name on the class list. 

Only cashiers and my family misgender me. 
I have a fairly feminine face structure, but present as masculine as possible, I also bind and pack everyday.

It annoys me, that two years after ""having to get used to it"" my family still doesn't get it right. I understand you can make a mistake, and I know my family is very religious. 
But after two years? I always remind them as friendly  as possible, but when I had bad grades, they say I'm not in the position to correct them. 

My little sister knew me from birth as her big brother, but then my mom broke off contact for a month, and after that, my sister considered me a girl. I was hurt, but didn't say anything about it. 

AMITA for not accepting being misgendered even when I understand that I can't pass because of my face at the moment?"	"Your parents suck. You aren’t the assholei n the slightest. Literally just living your life.
Their just being as mean as possible in an attempt to bully you into submission, get a bit more stern with them
No you’re not. That’s really fucked up of your family
Nope. They’re shitty, transphobic, gaslighting parents. And I’m so sorry you’re going through this
Respecting you as a person should NOT be dependent on your grades. That is abusive and toxic as fuck. Your mother ""correcting"" your sister is her demanding everyone disrespect you. Get the hell out if you are able and cut all contact. Your abusers (they do not deserve to be called family) will never let you be happy if they already disrespect you like this.
Your parents are mistreating you
If you are with them most days it literally takes a couple weeks to get used to it, I'm not out so the friends I live with and one who I also work with have to switch back and forth through the day and they still rarely get it wrong after like 8 weeks, I'd they do a quick correction and that's it.

Your family is just being shit unfortunately.
You’re not in the wrong here. After two years their excuse of needing time doesn’t hold up. They just don’t want to. 

I’m not saying deliberately go out of your way to start drama. But it’s probably time to make it very clear this isn’t a negotiation and they don’t get a say in this. This is a thing thats real and it’s not going to go away no matter hours much they ignore it.
NTA. You have the right to be accepted for who you are. Your mother is being hurtful and disrespectful and offensive, so it is normal for you to be and feel offended. Please do not let her behavior make you feel like you are the one who is in the wrong position. If you are a boy 👦 that is all there is to know. If anyone cannot accept that they are TA. Just saying…
Ummm, can we talk about the sister for a second? No one else is fuming because of the mom here? What I'm taking from this is that your mom TOOK TIME to teach your little sister to MISGENDER you. Why on Earth is this woman a mother?
Aaandd that’s the type of behavior that will get your children to hate you and you ending up dying in the nursing home. You’re not the asshole. Your family is toxic and abusive. You shouldn’t deny someone’s identity because they get a bad grade. That’s fucked up.
Tell them that you can't get good grades unless you're properly gendered. They're very wise and knowledgeable to see the connection. But they're seeing it backwards (they're a little mixed up in the head, but god forgives them!).
NTA if they haven't gotten it after two years they're not even trying. Especially with the whole ""you're not in a position to correct them"" gambit.
Even after 2 and a half years (considering birthdays, funnerals, holidays and hang outs) my sister STILL accidentally misgenders me when introducing me to people. Shes trying... and ugh your not the asshat. 

They... you are are more self aware than them.
""AITA for responding in the normal way to emotional turmoil?""
NTA. Being gendered properly shouldn't be contingent on getting good grades. It isn't a privilege based on doing well in school to be called what you feel comfortable being called.
Your parents are just being transphobic. Like with any relationship, respect is important, they're clearly not respecting you. If you've tried to talk to them about it, like you have by correcting them, and they still haven't started to respect you, that relationship has turned abusive. Try to save yourself from as much trauma as you can and cut your time with them as short as possible, and try to get into therapy if that's possible for you, they'll help you find ways to work on the toxic mindsets your parents have conditioned into you and help you find a way into taking care of yourself. Realize your family is people too, they're just people, like your friends, coworkers, stragers. A thing that helps me is wondering if I'd be fine with that behaviour if it was coming from a friend or if I would cut that friend out of my friendgroup.
That's a hard place to be, unfortunately we can't control how others percieved us, it will only come when they decide they want to change. 

I'm privileged enough to have a semi supportive family that is willing and able to pay for therapy to try to bridge the divide that has grown between us. In our first session my very conservative religious mother admitted thay she doesn't believe transgender people exist, to her I am her mentally ill effeminate son. What makes it even harder is that she sees herself as the victim, that I am a hypocrite for wanting her to accept me while asking she change her beliefs.

No, you are not the a**hole. You are stuck in a situation where your family feels you are asking them to choose between you and their beliefs. Unfortunately, it sounds like they have chosen their beliefs over your wellbeing. It may be difficult, but just like any other abusive relationship the first step is acknowledging it for what it is and if possible getting yourself out of harm's way. Just like any abusive relationship healing does not come from the abuser, it would be nice if your family eventually came around, but either way it is going to be up to you to overcome the hurt they caused you.
No honestly, I can't believe you're even asking. This behavior is just gross. Everyone should respect your gender. I know first hand what its like for a family member to call you mentally ill and say they care about you in the next. It's just not true. If they cared they'd at least pretend to understand. They're being cruel.
I'm sorry your family is being awful about this. You are not the asshole here. Gendering you correctly should not be dependent on grades. It should just be regular human decency.
You are not the AITA for wanting your preferred pronouns to be used. Anyone who misgenders you is though, even if they are also trans. Your pronouns are part of your identity and anyone who denies it is in the wrong.
they just want you to ""get over your mental illness"" and ""give up trying to be a buy"". and fuck that! if they don't accept you, you gotta accept yourself, dude. you're definitely not an asshole here :( i hope that things get better for you. sending good wishes your way.
your parents are jerks and no you're not the asshole. you shouldn't ever accept being misgendered, there are very very few scenarios where this is acceptable (for example when your life is at stake)
NO you are not. this sucks and is transphobic. you don’t have to pass to be recognised for who you are. you are more than allowed to be offended!
You're not the asshole your family are the assholes! I feel you, my parents are the same
Acknowledging someone's gender identity is part of the basic respect all people are due, even if their outward appearance doesn't seem to match their identity. 

Your parents are the assholes for not respecting your gender identity.
""... but when I had bad grades, they say I'm not in the position to correct them.""

How fucking dare they! Your identity is not contingent on your school performance. Perhaps you would do better in school if they gave you the most basic amount of respect that they afford everyone else.

Gently correct your little sister, because it's not her fault your parents are lying to her about you. But your parents deserve all the ire you have. They aren't ""getting used to it,"" if they're not even trying.
You're parents are shit and so are their opinions, don't listen to them.
Every time your parents misgender you, get a bigger packer.
You're certainly NTA.. If it's been years, there's no excuse. Bad grades are not an excuse to do that. It's probably even harder to do well in school when your own family discriminates against you
Yup, definitely feel this - and in my case, it's been nearly a decade of these ""mistakes"". 

You're NTA. That would be your family. And sometimes people are like that, and you just have to make all the plans you can to get away from them as soon as you're able to (which means financial as well as emotional and mental freedom - even if you have the money part sorted, which most young people don't have the luxury of, you have to also be able to make life-altering decisions without the guidance of an elder of some sort, which most young people have - so you're going to have to be much more mature than the average young person in order to get out, because you won't have the fallback of family - even for advice. You have to go NC if it continues - perhaps if you medically transition and don't even look feminine anymore then they can't keep misgendering and deadnaming you, but that could also have the opposite effect because you won't be what they expected, and many people aren't mature enough to handle it when somebody close to them is not what they expected).
I’d cut them off 100% (except your little sister, make sure she knows misgendering is NOT ok). Hopefully you can get away and be somewhere safe.
Okay, having bad grades has no barring on being worthy  of respect, that's just bullshit. It isn't a privilege to be gendered correctly, it's basic decency. You're not the asshole they're just transphobic. 

I'm really sorry to hear your little sister started to misgender you, I'm sure your that's your mom's doing. I always approach this kind of problem like this: I can't control weather or not someone sees me as the right gender, but I will insist you refer to me in a way I'm not completely averse to. If someone won't even do that, miss me. Don't need you. This is very reasnoble to be upset by.
they're probably trying to be as mean as possible to you soo you'll ""stop pretending"" they probably think your pretending to be trans and probably said to them self's ""if you be mean as possible to them then the they'll stop"" (btw don't stop ur parents are just mean) sooo yeah that's what u think ;ut idk tho
4 years here, same shit. sometimes they don't change and all we can do is save up and gtfo.

good luck with your transition man💙
Your parents have only known you as your birth gender and honestly always will. It's likely not in their mental abilities to put themselves in your shoes if they've never had those feelings themselves. They're most likely scared which leads to anger, distrust, and dismissal in an attempt to maintain their reality. I'm not condoning their actions, just trying to highlight what they are possibly going through. It's not easy for anyone when a loved one goes through transition or otherwise breaks our barriers of belief. That's why unfortunately WE have to be the strong ones.WE have to be the patient ones. WE have to be the accepting ones. I know it's frustrating, i went through similar with my parents, they actually told me to stop or move out of the house. Thought i was just being dramatic and needed to get a girlfriend. They still don't accept me 15 years later, but we have gotten past our differences and have a good relationship now. Focus on what you need to do for you, find someone who supports you whole heartedly, and when you show them that you can live the life that makes you happy, things will get better.
NTA, acceptance shouldn’t be conditional on things like grades. Your family are the assholes, sorry you have to put up with that shit.
Honestly, it helps to just give up on any chance your family will accept you and instead accept the fact that they won’t. My parents have ignored and denied the fact I’m trans since I came out and it sucks bur at this point why fight a fight I can’t win? Just to cause myself more mental anguish? Just to make my own living conditions at home even more insufferable?
Absolutely not

Also maybe talk to your little sister about how you feel if you can and if your relationship with her allows it, little kids are sometimes easier to explain to. But it's your life and I'm just a person on Reddit with no experience in this field
definitely not the asshole, if they can't adjust after all that time, they are lazy and for sure the more assholey
Your parents are the assholes, not you
Not at all I’m so sorry you have to deal with that crap you deserve a way better environment you should be respected and your identity should be respected ❤️
no.  They are actively refusing to acknowledge you. That's them being an asshole.  You're in the right.  The line comes when you know they don't care that you hurt from the misgendering.
Now if you had never told them, and they didn't know you at all, then getting upset might make you an asshole, but that clearly isn't the case.
you’re definitely not the asshole for wanting to be treated with basic human decency, not being able to fully pass the way you want to does not warrant being treated like that
Definitely not the asshole. You're being disrespected.
No. You are not.

Your mother is being controlling of you and manipulative of others to hurt you. Not to mention projecting the negative feelings onto you. 

This is not unconditional love.
Demanding your identity be respected is the bare minimum to ask for.
Passing or not, it doesn't matter. They should be respecting you and referring to you how you feel most comfortable.
No. And fuck your mom for conditioning your mental health and well being on your fucking grades, that's straight up abuse.
You're not TA. My dad used to jokes about f----ts and tr-----s, but it only took him a couple months to stop having to correct himself and just support me. He's a Trump voting Christian. There is literally no excuse for what they're doing to you other than malice.
Yea I’m just a slightly older version of you, out for a couple of years, my parents keep trying to tell me they’re trying to “get used to it”. They’re never gonna get used to it. We don’t talk much anymore.
Nta- let's go about it this way.. what religion are they?
family is people who support and love you, not the ones who manipulate you to make you feel like shit on a daily basis because of what you identify as, believe me ik what you are going through, i have an androgynous face and voice and constantly get misgendered after a year on HRT and visible signs of being a man. family is who you want to let in your circles. i hope this makes you somewhat better.
I have also a religious background. My mother doesn’t understand that I was scared to death of my feelings. I became my own boss, have my event agency what really sucks during Covid, but I am 33 and raised as a Mormon I am just starting to accept the female version of me, that I always wanted to become. To be trans was something that I never heard about of, I was afraid to get in a hospital and never come out. I am just starting to overcome myself, change name and all of that. You at least have a family AND most important you seem to be young and know pretty well what you want to be. I admire that.
Its definitely not on you. You have every right to be angry with them...what they do sucks and there is honestly no excuse for such behaviour.
I know its hard, as they are family but especially family should support you and care about you..its sad that they are often the worst :/

tl/dr: you are definitely not to blame and got every right to be angry with them.
no your family is just fucked up... not saying that you should but in some cases its better to ""abandon"" your family, because sometimes its better to just leave toxic people out of your life... again not saying that you have to more like saying that it is a option that you could do if you wanted to and its not wrong in any way to think considering doing it
Your parents are the assholes, not you
You are NOT. Your family is in the wrong, they don't seem to respect you at all. Keep doing what you've been doing, correcting them and standing up for yourself and who you are.
the only assholes here are your parents! you absolutely are justified in being upset
it sickens me to hear of parents using school performance as justification to ignore someone’s identity. you deserve to be respected. you are valid. and there’s nothing wrong with expecting that from your family. 

like damn, school is hard enough without dealing with coming to terms with identity
Do not give into their bullying, move out aa fast as possible. Fuck your family
You are not the asshole here. Your parents are.
> she recently told me that I'm mentally ill for seeing myself as a boy 

You didn't have to post anything other than this.

This is offensive behavior and I'm not even a very good trans ally.  I'm all aboard the trans rights are human rights train but I don't recognize trans as ""the same as"" cis in many categories.  They occupy a ""currently figuring out how it compares to the expected binary"" for me, so I tend to reject a lot of the straight trans acceptance stuff on point of ""needs more data"".

But the human component of being trans?  You're human first.  A human boy and a human girl are both people, regardless of their assigned or presenting genders.

Saying you're mentally ill is way beyond misgendering, it's intended to offend you, and shame you into ""giving up being trans""

You're not an asshole at any level for being offended, but it might do your mental wellbeing a lot of good to understand that they're being intentionally ill mannered, and while offensive, internalizing it is only increasing your own anxiety.
Do the opposite, don't be nice when they missgender you, bring hell. Otherwise they will never stop.
Definitely not. My parents still misgender me sometimes, but it's always accidental and they apologize after. There's a difference between making an effort and messing up every once in a while, and intentionally messing up without the intention of getting better.
Bro u r not the asshole for wanting to be seen as the gender you are
No you're not. I would literally break contact with your family if I was In your situation
NTA
That is all kinds of horrible.  
I am so sorry.

Also for grades? The hell?  
They are just looking for excuses to be assholes.
If they can’t change in two years they probably won’t ever change. Try to keep in touch with your little sister and secretly enlighten her on not being transphobic because your parents are probably teaching her to do stuff like that.
You should be proud for standing up for yourself man. Going up against your family is a big challenge, but it's necessary for self respect sometimes
Ten years in and mine still don't understand, trust me it might get better, but the misgendering does for most and doesn't for others, but I think if you keep on trying to get them to understand, they will. I just was never willful enough to force mine to remember who the hell I am.
NTA Honestly, my advice is genuinely stop and have a conversation with yourself, of what you plan on doing when your family continues down this path. What happens 4 years from now, and they're still aggressively misgendering you and gaslighting you making you believe you don't deserve basic respect? You deserve to be surrounded by people who gender you correctly. I'm going to be brutally honest, your family doesn't love you unconditionally, they love you conditionally. If you're not going to be their little princess they're not going to love you.
NTA
NTA you deserve to be respected
I have no advice, just wanted to say that I'm in the same boat and I get you. We can tough it out.
trust me, if you were then so would every cracked egg on earth
Absolutely NTA your parents are
you're not the asshole. your parents are the assholes
you aren’t the asshole at all. no matter what you look like or how you present, pronouns should always be respected.
No but you probably should be more of one!/jk

You arent the asshole for your parents not accepting you at all and making life harder on you. THEY are the assholes. Not you. And I hope it gets better.
Nta you are not mentally ill that was an awful thing to say. Two years is a ling time and they LIVE with you. I’ve been out for almost two years and none of my immediate family has “slipped up” in MONTHS. You are being reasonable by being upset when treated badly
I’m sorry that you parents don’t accept you. I know how that feel. I personally believe that you can’t be wrong for how you feel. Actions can be wrong but feeling ehh, not so much. As far as your mom goes, maybe she just needs time to grieve. For her she’s loosing the daughter she had and gaining son. That change doesn’t happen over night. Just like it might have taken you sometime to figure out your gender, it might take her sometime to accept her new son. Hopefully she comes around. I wish you the best.
Ur family is fucking crazy, im sorry :( i hope u can get out of there soon! Stay safe <3 

(He/it/they)
NTA.  

They had plenty of time.  They aren't used to it because they don't believe you.  OP, I'm sorry, but most likely the only thing that will change their mind is changing your legal name,  gender, taking HRT and growing a beard/getting ripped, or some equally masculine presentation.  A partner that loves you as a man can help, especially if they are either a feminine woman or a flaming gay man.  

Givin that they are religious, even all that might not make the difference.  They can have faith, so they never need to change their beliefs regardless of evidence.  

I hope you can persevere until you can get some distance, independance, and most importantly, autonomy.  Then you can live honestly, and they will do what they want.  

Best of luck to you.
It really angers me how many families hide behind the whole „give us time! We need time! If we have to accept you, you also have to accept us needing time. Some need more time than others“. And that’s cis-privilege bullshit
Worse yet they are gaslighting OP into thinking he’s wrong for asking for basic respect, like??? Boils my blood to see victims so in the corner that they start questioning their boundaries and sanity. Respect is never too much to ask for.
Yup, that's my sister too, she never even pretended to understand and now she refuses to acknowledge me as I am she's, if I may say this without offense, a bitch. All I ever did was want out too, because of her and because of my dad, and enough is enough.
This
That bugged me a lot, too. Losing access to the Xbox, the car, or the phone may be a reasonable consequence for bad grades. Losing access to your right to be seen for who you really are is not.
If your parents don’t accept you for who you are, they are not good parents.

I understand a period of adjustment, but when it’s going on years it is too much, and clearly an excuse to not respect your identity.
god, same situation here. it makes being anywhere near family extremely upsetting
Really sorry you’re dealing with this. Wishing you lots of love, safety and all the best. It sucks on another level when those who are to protect you cause the hurt."	sjis7f	trans	1272	0.97	2022-02-03 13:09:14

Very cool. Do they let you keep the uniform. 👍😇
You're so stylish!
You look great. Love the look
ngl if this wasn’t r/trans i would have no idea if you were trans or not


also I’m so happy for you
Anyone misgendering you seriously needs to get their eyes checked... and then whacked for being stupid.  PS your style and beauty are delightful!
Howwww 🥰🥺🥺😊😝😊🥺🥺🥰
Gorgeous
You look incredible girl! I really like your style!
Thank you 😊😊
Ty!!
Aw thank you :))
I don’t see it lol but thanks!
Came here to say the same thing.
They were on sale from Steve Madden 🤪
Thank you!!

It’s been such a blessing. Also not having to buy my own coffee every day 😂

There’s no uniform! The best part haha
Thank you 😊 I love dressing up!
Omg ty 🥺
The amount of times I got misgendered while wearing a dress in retail…. It was so annoying lol
I'm afraid I have you beat on that front. 

Not a coffee person. 🙂
Love that outfit. So beautiful.
Lol even better. It already yours
Keep doing it, you look amazing ☺️
Well I think you are totally adorable!
I’ve spent thousands at this point for sure lol

Probably spent a few hundred on skittles alone.😬"	wg0uuf	trans	1241	0.99	2022-08-04 13:08:38
I got misgendered at work then corrected by a little girl.	"I work in an *undisclosed* uk supermarket and while on tills I basically get misgendered by every customer. Sometimes even correctly gendered then they go back and misgender me. It hurts but I just try let it go because otherwise it would drive me crazy. 

Last night though I had a couple come in with a little girl and as I was serving them the mum said “give the sweets to the man” and the little girl said “no... that’s a lady”. My week hasn’t been fantastic because of stress and dysphoria but that comment from her really helped, for the rest of the night it kept me going and staying positive. 

Hope this brings a little joy to anyone needing it :3"	"Sometimes kids say the best things
There is a german saying telling that children always tell the truth ❤
This is one of the few things I like about young kids. I find them super obnoxious but they've lived their entire lives in a world where being trans is quickly becoming accepted, so unlike older adults who aren't as used to it being as widely accepted as it is they just go along with it.
Keep celebrating the little things. And kids are also brutally honest in what you see, so I'd take it as a much bigger compliment.

I got told by my partner I look like a lesbian with my earrings in,  which is something at least.
I just want to let you know how brave you are for working at a place where you constantly get misgendered. I don't think I could stay sane in your situation, just remember that your mental health comes first before a supermarket chain ❤
That’s actually adorable
Kids are great. :) they’re funny sometimes, too. I remember one time, I was at a Cracker Barrel, and a blond lady with her, like, 10 year old kid, walked up to me and said “excuse me young lady, do you know where the candy dots are?” I had no name tag, no uniform, nothing, but before I could say anything, the 10 year old looked at her and said “mum, he’s like 12. He doesn’t work here.” I was 16, but it made me smile a bit. The lady just… walked off to the reception, nothing said after that. Dunno what happened, but it made me laugh.
While I was at work a coworker of mine called me an it, my sister is the manager and took her outside and chewed her out then my best friend Joe (her husband) chewed her out even more with her. God I love them
This is a keen reminder that hate is taught.
The kids will save us from boomer nonsense
Kids voice their minds how the world really is. Clearly the ""adults"" are just abiding by social standards while the kid hasn't been corrupted yet.
Kids are the BEST. I saw a friend yesterday that I haven't seen in person in a few months, and the T has really kicked in since then. Her six year old looked at me really hard for a minute and was like, ""why does it look like you have a moustache???"" I said it was because I was growing one on purpose, and that I was taking a special medicine that would help me grow a beard and change me voice. His little eyes kept getting wider and wider and he was like, ""wow! So maybe you're actually a boy then."" It was one of the best conversations I had all week.
Awww kids are the cutest!
And that’s why children and younger ppl are 100% better than adults.
Awww children are great
I got called a fag by a kid because I am trans so I mean they are a double edged sword
Wonderful! Beautiful story. Hugs to you ❤❤❤
Hate is learned not something you are born with. I do hope that is a sign that the future will be less cruel and bigoted. Bless that little girls heart.
You don’t have to pass to be a woman. 

Just keep going!
I honestly hate kids, but I do have a respect for their ability of non-judgement and the ability to really see people without knowing. I think adults and people probably just over 10 tend to see through a very gendered and strict view of life, but with little kids they just see who it is. I think it goes the same with spirits IMO. I don't know if I believe in spirits but I will acknowledge that children have been able to see more than us on occasion. 

Its really nice to be able to know these children who know nothing about gender and the world of gender identity can be accepting. It shows that you don't need to understand something to accept it. Adults really need to learn from kids like this one.
Love it!  🥰🥰  Lilli~
They really do lol
Wondering what it sounds like in German 🤔
I love old German sayings lol❤️
Oh ! We have the same in french ! ""La vérité sort de la bouche des enfants""
Yeah pretty much lol, kids will say what they’re thinking and it can either be too blunt or super affirming like this ^ 

It’s nice to know that this is the new generation :))
I think children just pick up on the vibes of how someone presents themselves a lot more easily, adults look at secondary sex identifiers, children look at clothes, makeup, etc.
This

Children are so annoying but they usually are less judgy than their elders
This. I came out to my kids last week and they were like ""cool. So... da- oops, mom, can we go play roblox now?"" I had prepped for anything, but my partner was totally right, they're just used to this stuff now.
Thankyou, I really appreciate that. Honestly it’s stressful and can really get me down but each day gets a little better because of little moments like this. Also don’t worry haha, my mental health is a priority when it comes to work lol ❤️
That’s honestly so sweet <3 That kid will grow up knowing you as your preferred gender too which is amazing. Glad to know the next generation is based lol
Sorry to hear that, I’ve been called that too but it’s mostly older kids who will do it. I think there’ll always be people like that unfortunately but there’s definitely fewer and fewer every day. 

Anyway keep doing you and don’t let anyone tell you otherwise ❤️
(Not a child story but still made me feel good) there's a gas station that I deliver fuel to and the attendant looked at me with my hair down and she said I looked more fem to her. It was a small compliment but it really did make me feel better about myself. It happened a couple of nights ago so I'm paraphrasing.
Agreed. One time, my baby cousin called me good girl, I don't know why she did but still, euphoria moment
""Kindermund tut Wahrheit kund.""

Literally translates to ""child's mouth declares the truth"". 

And it does ♡.
Thank you you are a nice person I don't see why someone would be nasty to you
Awh that’s really sweet :3 It’s little things that make the biggest impact. We definitely need more people like this, just people being awesome
If you remove the spaces like so many German words do, it looks even cooler...

Omg you're like a ray of sun. I wish I glowed like you do.
You are absolutely gorgeous!
Okay... So I am asking you to be honest with me... Are you an enby because you are an ageless genderless celestial being who decended from a realm of plutonic ideals?

Cuz if you aren't I could be easily fooled into believing it and I want to get through at least ONE day without committing some form of blasphemy.
You look amazing ! 😊
Ugh those people can burn. Strut along my beautiful friend, they are but fools. Keep on being radiant!
You are glorious.
You are just stunning, keep your head up <33
My god you're gorgeous
Just misgender them lol.
You are very beautiful

Thank you
Yeah being misgendered doesn't get to me either I just laugh it off the only person it did get to me from was an old therapist I had who said that ""you only think you're trans because you're a Borderline"" so yeah I literally felt like curb stomping her now at least I have a therapist who does a lot of work with LGBTQ+ folks pretty sure she actually volunteers for a charity that helps LGBTQ+ youth who are struggling with depression and anxiety
Thank youuuuu

Sweet tattoo and I also like the devil horns because ya know be queer go to hell or at least that's what a 2 thousand year old book says that's been contradicted numerous times by people who have a PhD I don't know why I feel more inclined to believe someone who has Doctor before their name even if it's not a medical doctor
I had a therapist tell me the same thing years ago haha fuck people
That new therapist of yours sounds like a really good person overall. I admire that kind of stuff.
Yesss!! Of course! I'm sorry you had to go through that!
Well it doesn’t necessarily have to be like, yelling at them. Just whenever they get mentioned or whatever, just misgender them. And it will slightly annoy them to the point until they’ll stop doing it to you.
You are very welcome.
You're welcome 😊
Yeah I hate most people because they're either just annoying or don't understand me but it's far from the dumbest thing I've heard of a therapist say one apparently told someone with Borderline Personality Disorder that they don't believe in mental illness literally a therapist who's job it is to treat the mentally ill didn't believe in mental illness
Not really I hate her
Maybe I spoke too soon, but I hope one day you find the right therapist. I hear that it makes therapy significantly better and helpful.
Well no she's a good therapist it's just a symptom of BPD is splitting which is the clinical term for when your views of a person changes dramatically on the slightest thing all it would take for me to say I hate someone is for them to use the wrong tone then I feel like they hate me

I wanted to share a story about my FTM son	"My eldest (Vincent) was just starting to bind in public and already had his hair cut short. He would still get misgendered and I would often correct people. He is a chill dude and he knows he is maybe 100 lbs soaking wet.

This day, we were at Target. It was Easter and we had a debate about the insane number of flavored peeps. He LOVES peeps. He made a comment about wanting to try all of them and there is ""no such thing as a bad peep.""

A women in the isle leaned over to me and nodded to my son and said: ""You are raising him right."" 
I tell you, my guy was BEAMING for the rest of the trip. Sometimes, it is that simple to make someone's day."	"Woah OP, don‘t scare me like that. XD I expected the most aweful things happening to him, when you started in past tense.  

What a lovely story! Good for him! :-)
That is soooo awesome for you and him!   Things like this can't possibly happen to often for transgender children growing up 💜. You are awesome ☺️
This is so sweet! All the power to ya and ya son.
On another note, what's a peep?
So this is what a good parent looks like
It warms my heart to see so many excepting parents. Nothing is better than unconditional love.
I still remember the first time I got “ladies” one afternoon with my mom.
(I’m transfem by the way.)
Squee! Mine was when we were standing in line at a mall fast food joint. My son walked up, ordered and there was some kind of confusion, like they had grabbed the wrong food. Dude looked at my son and said, ""Yeah, he ordered that."" (or w/e it was) .. that kid was on cloud nine for the rest of the day. Was so good to see him happy!
That's awesome! Last month I confused a woman at a clothing store and it made my week. My sister and I went out to buy clothes for our cousin's wedding. I was in the women's changing room (not in a stall, but in the greater area) because she wanted my opinion on different dresses. A middle-aged woman walked in and said, ""oh, I'm sorry. I thought this was the women's changing room."" 

I was so surprised at being read correctly that I almost didn't respond. But I reassured her, ""oh, it is. I'm just helping my sister pick a dress."" 

I was so dang happy.
please be my parent
I love this story, thanks for sharing, he is also correct about no bad peeps.
That's so good!   I read halfway and was dreading that she'd comment something horrible.   Glad to hear you feel better!
Will disagree about the peeps. But glad to see your son is happy
I almost went with the name Vincent! You're a good mom.
This is so sweet it makes me wanna cry. The way you talk about him is so wholesome. You’re doing good :)
Had us in the first half, not gonna lie
This is the sweetest thing
Yes! It really is the little things. I was at the airport a week ago and I made the silly mistake of putting my hands in my pockets when walking through security. The security guard chuckled and said, “come on, young man, you know better than to put hands in pockets. Let’s try again.” I was so happy and my heart felt so light that day.
Saving this for a smile later cuz I was so hyped over one of Da Boiz™️ treating me like a normal guy for ten seconds heh
I hope to be able to share similar stories soon. :-) I also need to get my local library to change their policy on names. But that’s another issue.
I’m so happy for him! As a fellow ftm, sometimes it can be really hard to pass in public
He chose a good name :)
Im really happy he was gendered correctly! It truly is such a wonderful feeling
Peeps violate my “no marshmallows” food rule so I don’t eat them. But going back to the point of this post, I’m happy to hear he’s doing well.
Okay could some tell a non American what are peeps? I use the word peeps to refer to people so flavoured peeps is quite a strange thing to read
Awe that’s awesome! Happy for him!
That's so sweet omg
I feel better knowing I’m not the only one who assumed the worst from the first paragraph.
Aww thanks. He is special to me. And his siblings (who is Non-binary)
Little marshmallow animals that taste like toxic waste. 10/10 elite snack
They’re these little marshmallow chicks (as in baby chickens) covered in sugar and occasionally they have different flavors!
The best way I can describe it as is a very sugary, marshmallow chick. I think?
Theyre marshmallows shaped like little chickens coated in flavored colorful sprinkles  of (very vast) different flavors
Daw. Thank you for saying that. I just prefer a living and thriving child over one that hates me or worse.
That is always really cool when that happens.
That is exactly how I felt seeing that extra validation. Good job, mama.
Absolutely! I have two kids. What is one more?
Aww thank you so much. Now he had get his Italian dad to stop going ""Yo, Vinny! Baddabing!"". The torture. 😂
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peeps
I assume the worst on things like that and tv shows where nothing bad ever happens.
I'll trust yours, and dis man's, taste buds.
Wait, the toxic waste taste is a GOOD one? I'm confused
Ooo well imma see if we got em for Easter next year to give em a taste!
Thanks!
None of which is actual chicken flavor.
That is good, all parents should be like that, keep supporting him it is clear he is going down a good path
we need more like you, thank you
You too!! So good to see other supportive parents out there. Have you found any groups that are for alphabet kids' parents? I've been trying to get a group going in my area but they are.. yeah, not likely to happen anytime soon.
:D
Make sure to give him a really dumb mafia nickname, too. Like Vinny Roast Beef, or Vinny the Elbow. Make him sound like a background character from Goodfellas.
As a kid whos moms side is sicilian, I feel that in my core 🤣
Me too but like. Peeps are good I don’t make the rules
I like the chocolate covered ones but you can't go wrong with the classic yellow ones.
They’re pretty good! The sugar can be messy though, so be sure to have some napkins on hand. :)

I just got misgendered. It's sad how these things can ruin a perfect night. I wish I wasn't so affected by this, I feel so weak sometimes..		"How would someone misgender you looking like that???? Must have dementia or smth
You look’s so beautiful
Wait how on earth were you misgendered?  You look like a cis woman to me.  In fact you look very similar to my Auntie.
How in the actual fuck were YOU misgendered?!
You look fabulous hon, I think it was likely just a slip up. I've called my male teacher mom before. Sometimes things just slip by accident. I think it's just that our dysphoria sometimes amplifies all references to that

I had a moment today myself. While getting ready to go out for dinner, I saw my partner getting dressed in the bathroom and noticed she had on a shirt that I also happen to have, so I wore the same color pants, and the exact same shirt. I waited in the bedroom for her to come it and yelled ""twinsies!"" He reaction was ""Ah really?? Well, I'll have my sweater on anyways"". I quietly removed my shirt after she left the room and threw it in the trash. I proceeded to put on a very gender-neutral t-shirt instead. I tried to hide the fact I was crying inside, but it was obvious I went from my normal cheerful self to a sad mess. Thankfully, I told her during dinner and she apologized and assured me it had nothing to do with me dressing like her ""in that way"" (since I told her I was feeling dysphoric about it), it was just that she was getting prettied up and got caught off guard that I matched her... dunno, but it can definitely get to me even for the small and subtle queues

Hope you feel better about it soon ❤
To people who say ""I call *EVERYONE* bro."" 

That's cool. Hey,  I call *EVERYONE*  Rocky Dennis. Don't be mad, when I say this I'm being ""gender neutral"" & I ""mean no harm"" 

Yes. This is how that argument sounds🙄
I don’t see anyone but a lady!🌸
God, I know exactly how you feel. And it feels deliberate when you completely pass 😭Happened to me today too, I’m so sorry. Sending virtual hugs.
Wait… how did that happen!? Is the person blind?
You are so beautiful!
Even when it's not meant with ill intent, I swear these words related to our agab are the loudest. I hate it. Try and remember intent when it happens. x.x
Anyone misgendering you is doing so intentionally to be cruel.  If you let it bother you the transphobes win
It's ok, you aren't weak people just suck. You look great btw 💕
Girl you look beautiful, I love your hair ❤️
Holy shit, how?! Youre looking fabulous!
You literally look cis omg how did someone misgender you, you're gorgeous??
You're a beautiful women <3
Why someone can misgender you?,you look pretty feminine to pass
I don't want to pretend i know how that feels, but i can say i know how it feels when someone says something hurtful and/or demeaning.

I look myself in the mirror, deep into my own beautiful eyes in the morning and say ""I love you"" "" No one else can define me"" "" I am confident"" ""I am loved"" ""I am accepted"".

The affirmation in the morning has built up confidence in me where as before I couldn't even look at myself for more than second.

I truly hope this doesn't slow you down. 
You ARE a beautiful woman. You ARE loved! You are just as worthy and deserving as anyone else. 

Pick up the bike and start riding again!
How???? How TF did they misgender YoU????
\*big-sis-hug\*
I think you are very beautiful
Sorry to hear that 😞
How tf can you look at someone like you and think MAN?! btw is that tattoo Hebrew? Sry if it’s a wired question it just looks like Hebrew letters
You are beautiful. That is all that matters.
You are not weak! Being trans makes you the strongest woman in the world ❤️❤️❤️
You are an stunningly beautiful woman. What is sad is how utterly shitty some people can be. What it really is is a reflection of how crappy they feel about themselves. Nobody with good self-esteem goes around trying to hurt people like that. You're stronger than you realise. Just having the strength to be who you really are and not what other people say you should be is a clear sign of that. Keep your head up girl xx
How???
Jeez, I'd never misgender you. That's for sure. I would never ever even think that you are not cis... But if it makes your hurt any less, I'm a cis female and I get misgendered myself every once in a while 😅 and I can't say that I'm too masculine or something. If I show you my pic I'm sure you'd agree. I'm what they call a tomboy. Try not to take this personally, maybe that guy has poor eyesight. You look gorgeous btw🌷🔥😊 hugs🤗
I feel you. Just dont know how posting a selfie online will help
You aren’t even the slightest masculine or even look like a man. You pass so well and I’m deeply sorry they misgendered you. You’re absolutely gorgeous
You’re beautiful! So sorry that you were hurt. I hope you took some space to heal. 💕
Oh that person was just being a tit.

Don't let some bigot intentionally get you down. Appreciate your beauty and let their lameness be the nail in their coffin.
I feel like we should misgender them back lmao see how they feel
 are you sure it's real? They/ she looks like a female to me.

Years ago I used to think a lot of people were calling me names behind my back and they weren't really doing it
Look at you. I’d bet you didn’t get misgendered (mistaken for the wrong gender), you got antigendered (called the wrong thing on purpose to upset you - a distinction I just made up words for right now on the spot.)
I am sorry but no...

That person was either blind, mentally disabled or just plain weird.

If you get misgendered then these is no hope for any of us. 

You are fucking gorgeous and you should know that by now ;)
Dm me
It’s not weakness to feel bad when someone doesn’t actually even see you, it feels bad when someone conjures up an idea of who you are and puts it on you.
😢
You’re not weak for feeling hurt when someone does something hurtful. You’re strong for living your life authentically in spite of the pain. 🖤
Well take this to heart,from Florida of all hellscapes. You have a good night ma'am. And your dress does seriously good things for your eyes
I’m sorry you had that happen to you. I think you’re pretty though
You have natural beauty
Okay so this might not help but I was scrolling and thought this was a celebrity page and you were Paget Brewster (she plays Emily Prentiss from criminal minds and I always thought she was really pretty.) then I saw the caption and was like “Huh. Wow they’re really pretty.” 

So you’re definitely a beautiful and strong woman and you deserve to be properly gendered.
I see a beautiful woman.
You're beautiful girl! I'm sorry that happened to you. It sucks that people think they have to be such assholes especially to total strangers. Be strong. You're better than him. Much love hon
Sorry sweetie your beautiful
They must have been blind. All I see is a totally beautiful woman.
How???? 

I mean, I just don't see it.....
My fiance checks reviews before going anywhere. But seriously? You're beautiful! WTF is wrong with them?
I don’t understand how people can be so cruel. I know this has you down but don’t stay there you are to precious to this world. You have people that love you. You are beautiful and I feel you have a kind and loving heart.  I can see it in your photo…
Happens to a lot of us! I had it the other day. A man in a wheel chair said ‘gosh you’re tall’ I replied ‘I am wearing heels today. His wife was beside me as I was trying to pass by walking (they were blocking the walkway as there was an assistant there too) I was walking kinda behind/ beside his wife but I didn’t get a good look at her and her me. But she said to her husband ‘he’s wearing heels.. I mean she!’ I was like Jesus two in one and I was just about to start work. I’ve just had voice surgery too, we have to have hard skin xxx
Girl you look so beautiful just whip that hair back wards and walk away like the boss bitch you are.
Maybe a voice thing? If your driver said it, I’m assuming you were sitting in the back seat having a convo
Hun your beautiful and just so pretty /p
How did you get misgendered??? You pass so perfectly not to mention whoever that was probably misgender you on purpose, what a idiot.
The cab driver.. it wasn’t Ill intended, what kinda hurts even more.. he instinctively said “thanks brother”..
😊 thank u
Next time don't trash your stuff so fast <3
Exactly 🙄
that's not the same but ok
Maybe it’s my voice.. I don’t know
Muito obrigada
Thank you 😊 🥰
I think it was My voice probably…
Thank you so much for the kind words. I can see a lack of self love sometimes… You r right… We need to build it everyday.
Muito obrigada ☺️ you r very kind
I’m feeling better today. I was feeling like shit yesterday.
Yes, It’s Hebrew . From the kabbalah
Thank you 😊
Ow thank you. We really are brave.
Wow 😮 that is so true. Thank you for reminding of that. These communities rocks. I’m receiving so much good advices. It really help to see things with a better perspective.
Cab driver.
Lol That was so funny to read .. made me smile, thank you..And thanks a lot for sharing your life experiences.
It helped a lot. I was feeling like shit yesterday. But received so many advices n shared experiences. I’m feeling much better today. Great community here 💕
Thank you very much for your comment! It helped a lot 🥰💕
I've done that a few times before and they don't like that especially in front of other people.
Hahahaha that is a fuckn great idea 💡! 😆
[removed]
Good to know that. I never heard the term antigendered. Thanks for sharing 😊
hey as an autistic person, please don't use ""mentally disabled"" as an insult, thanks
Nah, I know the culture most cab/Uber drivers come from. They see us as filth
Crap, I use dude alot. I'll do better!
Im sorry your hurt and I've been through similar. I just want to ask if it could have been a gender neutral ""brother"". I've been called guy, bro, and dude, but after a while of thinking about it I think they meant it in more of a gender neutral way. Im not saying it doesn't hurt or anything, just thought maybe this could be the case?
if it makes you feel better, i call most of my cis girl friends ""bro"" and ""man""
Ah so it was just a reflex, that’s still annoying though
Omg those ones, I always ‘forget’ to shut the door when I leave
people use bro, dude and stuff like that all the time for everyone. Its just slang the cab drive is used to saying, and i 100% guarantee you he says that to cis women too. you're over thinking it
that's the way young people talk today. I don't think he meant you were a man I think he ment to be friendly
Your welcome mami
I took it out of the trash after, and it's sitting safely in the laundry basket now 😇
🙄
you definitely don't look like a man at all. Have you done any voice training or checked out /r/transvoice ?
Absolutely can say in this photo you 100% pass. You’re gorgeous. I’ve had a cab driver misgender me once. I ended up just asking him why he did and he said at first he didn’t know I was trans, but my voice gave it away.

At least the voice is trainable, but being misgendered still hurts. I’m working on caring less about it and learning to accept myself in whatever shape or form I am as being me, regardless of gender. It’s just too stressful to deal with people (especially family) who just constantly misgender me. Then internalizing that and thinking there’s something wrong with my presentation (because “obviously” if I passed perfectly they wouldn’t do that).

If I get a he or him now and again, I try to remind myself that I’m a beautiful and kind person no matter what. And for the vast majority of other interactions where I get a she or her, I try to be grateful. It’s a long road we take that goes on for the rest of our lives. I only expect that one day you’ll just forget when the last time you got misgendered was. Then you can flash a little smile to yourself because you made that happen.
I'm glad. Thank you for sharing
Why thank you
Dam... way to be a dickhead lmao at least get there gender right, sure they may have a penis but if they present as a women refer to them as a women. Its just polite at least. And if it was just a mistake soneone made cool they happen. But if your dress up in more famine cloths asking would be the better route. Again tho cant blane people for mistakes but theres ways to avoid them. Ill shut up now before i drag it out to long
Yeah, me neither - but I needed a word to express the difference between accidental and malicious misgendering. I think I’d have to be malicious to misgender you!
Hey as a person with and schizophrenia. Should I have put severally in front to emphasize my point that only someone who would not be fully aware of their surroundings could make such a mistake? 

It's like walking on eggshells on the subreddit sometimes
Yeah. Maybe you r right. I may be overwhelmed by other stuff.. that was just the last drop.
I wonder too. I have three teens (2 girls 1 boy) (1 trans) and they use bro, dude, bruh and sometimes now dickhead 😡 for each other regardless of who it’s for.
No. Brother isn't gender neutral, ‘bro’ is pushing it.
Thank you anyway. It was really good to talk about it.
No they don't say it to cis women, it's usually ‘thanks darling’ followed by some creepy compliment.
They usually don't say it,  if you're over 50
🥰😺
Never done. Really thinking about it now ..
Thank you all guys! Lots of positive vibes here. ✨
or maybe, just maybe, don't use mental disability as an insult? if you don't care then good for you, that doesn't mean the rest of us don't.
Even if it was intended as gender neutral, it doesn't change how much it hurts you. But I will say, if he clocked you at all, if he thought there was a chance you were a trans woman, he probably would not have said it.
Hey it's alright. I guarantee you this is a common and okay feeling
I 100% use bro for everyone.
I use bro or dude for everyone. Maybe that was his case?
I have been working on it, but I use dude for everyone! It is a gender-neutral term in my area. For as long as I can remember, women have been calling women, dude. And men have been calling men dude, and everyone in between has been calling everyone in between dude. lol

It is an extremely hard habit to break. But I'm trying to be better about it because I know I may accidentally cause someone distress, and I don't want to do that.

BTW, you look awesome, and that color looks really good on you!
It likely was meant as gender neutral but it’s still not cool and I’m so sorry they did something to hurt you. You’re beautiful and I hope you have a better night 💜
Maybe not in your area. My sister's and i have all been called brother. And bro
That’s good, you’re so beautiful!
one fun thing about it is that it will also give you a nicer singing voice since you can hit more notes 😀
 i'm sure you mean well, but please consider how it affects a lot of us trans women tho, as you can see from this post, even when  you intend it as neutral, we don't know that and it can hurt. also reinforces patriarchy so there's that. but hey i'm not trying to tell you how to live your life . and please don't take this as an attack, just telling you how it makes me feel
Maybe.. I’m more sad for let it get into me . You know? I wish I could just don’t care that much.
Are you American?
I apreciate the feedback, I'll think on it. Ty

Hey so it makes total sense that this would effect you. I think most of us get taken back receiving a misgendering comment while we are out in public. Personally when I'm misgendered it ramps up my anxiety because  I worry about my safety. 

I have a long history with being bullied so my defense mechanism was to ""blend in"". Any time I stick out in random crowds I struggle to manage my emotional reaction. Luckily through therapy I've been able to manage this much better but it will always be a bit of an issue. 

Typically the reaction comes from the interaction hitting a core vulnerability that we have. Trying to identify that and finding coping strategies around that can be helpful.
Hey, you've figured out a problem with yourself and I see that as a win. Now that you've isolated the problem, you can now work on it. Everyone has thin skin about something and when you isolate what you have thin skin about, you can use that as a pathway to self improvement."	11o7y96	trans	1093	0.99	2023-03-11 02:09:30
Been getting misgendered and deadnamed every day for the past couple of weeks. Finally saw the man I'm meant to be in the mirror today for the first time since visiting family. I know I probably still look like a girl but it's the most I can do here safely		"Defiantly don't see a girl. You do however look like a teenage boy in this pic
Yeah idk what others are seeing, you pass buddy
Uh… you pass my dude!
Don't worry ma boy you will look like a super gigachad
Dude if you weren't on this sub I would deadass think you were a cis guy
Your a dude, dude I can’t find anything female about you from these two picks.
I just spent 5 minutes trying to find what part of you looks feminine and I'm still at a loss. You look incredible!
You look so handsome!
dude youre the most dudiest dude ive seen of all dudes
Looking handsome man 😊
You don't look femme at ALL, how the hell are you getting misgendered? Looks great dude! Love the hair
Honestly dude I had to dubble check the sub I was on. You pass %100. Don’t let family get you down, or anyone for that matter. You are who you are and no-one can take that away.
I mean, if you squint you can make out the remnants of a girl, but I could only see that by looking at it for a while and carefully considering each aspect of your face. At first glance and even if someone is talking to you, they won't notice unless they stare into your soul, and even then it's a stretch. Hell, I probably look more like a girl as a closeted transfemme who does nothing to look feminine than you do
You look so masculine! I have no idea what your family is talking about 🤷‍♀️
You look very manly actually!
Yeah you look like a dude especially in the second picture.
You're a beautiful man. Don't know what others think.
you look great man!
I thought u were born male
Te miras como el cantante de Greenday
Whoever the hell is dead naming and misgendering you must be grasping at straws, you're very clearly a dude in my eyes and in this pic
No I would have said sir or bro. You are a man and that is  final. And to who the person deadnamed you 
"" May all your words lead you into the ever black of guilt and dispar. May your transgressions be your doom and lasting sins forever haunt your immortal soul"" 
You will be a the type of guy who others can look up to. Don't give up. Stay strong and never back down from the challenges of life.
Idk what anyone else thinks but I think you pass pretty well. I rlly like ur hair btw :)
don't think about that, Alex, ur the vaporeon boy ;3
That last sentence there, the “I know I probably still look like a girl” yeah that’s dysphoria 100% bc I only see a guy in these pictures xD
I'm glad you're seeing yourself in the mirror and becoming more comfortable in your body!

If it helps, I immediately thought you were a dude before reading the title

I hope you find greater safety for self-expression
Ur so handsome what 
You are THE man
💞
Ngl, the only feminine part about you, is nothing! You pass more than my girl passing on me :)
Before reading the title I thought you were a transfem who hadn't started transitioning yet, you definitely look like a boy idk how others don't see it
Wouldn't bat an eyelid at subs young lad like you walking past - just another young lad 😁👍
Genuinely thought this post would be an ftm in early transition . You pass HARD
Nah dude you're a man, don't let anyone get you down
You're handsome💪
You look good my dude. I have to say I’m pretty sure I wouldn’t even realize. You keep doing you, it’s gonna be ok
What girl

There is no girl in this photo
Bro you look awesome. Definitely pass, don’t worry
You look like a cute boy
Looks like a young guy to me.
aww, that’s unfortunate that you’re getting misgendered and deadnamed :/. stay strong, though, you look super handsome!! 💚
You look like a boy. I saw that first pic and didnt read the caption and thought it was the before pic of a MtF transformation.
You pass easily dude, your eyes are playing tricks on you
You are a very handsome man and I'm so proud of you! Keep it up, Bestie! You're super amazing and you keep doing what you're doing! ✌✌✌
Thasa handsome lad right there! Here, King, you dropped this. 👑
Oh what a handsome man! Very strong, very brave!
Don’t know how old you are but you look like a late teen gamer. You definitely pass though you look young and I’m sorry your brain won’t let you feel okay, it’s unfair
yeah no joke you pass. hope it gets better for ya.
Ehh idk man, when I looked at you I thought you were just a young guy. Hell I had to double check the title
You is a straight up dude in my eyes
Bro you pass just fine dwbi, I know many cis guy friends that look more feminine than you. Doing great man!
you look just like a cis guy who went to my high school, you're totally passing
Nah, that's a man right there. I can even see the outline of a mustache tbh
Idk why those assholes dont see it but yuere a really manly man
Ngl I thought you were a trans girl who didn't pass at all.
I see a cis young man in these pictures. Sending you loads of love. I hope you, too, can see the young man you are.
you look super masc, they crazy
You pass so well I'm jealous 🥺
I see a man in these photos what u talkin about??
damn people do be blind tho cuz you look like a man to me. your hair kinda makes you look like a guy version of GoGo from Big Hero 6 ^-^
you definitely pass, don't listen to anyone who says otherwise. you're very handsome!
Look like a guy to me
More of a guy than I ever was, tell you that for sure. Idk what your family's on- you're all dude.
Bro, you look great! You're a good looking dude, and you pass well! Go kick dysphoria's bubblebutt!
Love the shirt dog. Huge hockey fan
Tbh i dead ass thought u were a dude not trans at all u look amazing bro keep it up
Handsome man
Bro, I see no feminine traits in your appearance, all I se is a handsome young man. Shame on those who are misgendering and deadname you.
Sweet looking boy to me.
Bruh for real couldn't tell. Not lying or overplaying. I didn't read what you said at first and was like, ""He kinda cute, wish I looked more like that""💀 You are solid bro frfr
Dude, you look like a dude. Glad you finally see it
Don’t be so hard on yourself my guy. You don’t look feminine, let alone a girl, literally at all. These little criticisms we say to ourselves are honestly the root of some really awful thought spirals, don’t give into them, be the great man you are, to *yourself!* keep your head up bro. 🏳️‍⚧️
nah dude you are the most manlike man i have ever seen, man
All i see is a handsome boy 😊 !  Don't let  ignorant people ruin your day. *assuring hugs*( if you're okay with it )
Boy what are you talking about!  You look geeky but totally cute guy material.
I'm living that, brother.
My workplace at large except a few very close work friends deadname me, because it's my ""Government Name"" despite asking multiple times to be called essentially anything else.
My siblings are both trying which helps but my parents both deadname and misgender me almost every time we speak.
It's a hard life, but they'll either meet the real you, or they won't. And they'll be the ones missing out on meeting you, because I'm CERTAIN that you're fuckin awesome.
Bruh you look like a dude i work with
You look beautiful
How tf can someone be so handsome man???
For a second I felt bad for thinking you look like a man, then I read the title. Dude you look great and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
No dude, you look guy as hell xD
You have a moustache, I've never seen a girl with a moustache so you must be a man
Girl? All I see is a very handsome man who doesn't deserve misgendering :)
Nah, don't bother, man. You totally look like a dude and the misinterpretation will be gone soon. ;)
Honestly you just look young to me but you look fine. You’ve got time so try not to worry so much.
i see no girl here
Definitely a man
For what its worth I think you look like a man. I thought this was gonna be a pre mtf tradition vent post. Sorry you are having a rough time bro. ❤️
I really don't understand what goes through people's minds when they misgender you, all I see is a man- you rock dude
Only see a man from there ;)
Well I thought you were a boy.
Whaat do you mean you still look a bit like a girl, even when I'm trying I can't even see any ""girly"" trait
Bro u'r awesome
Dude, you look 100% like a guy. Its fucking impossible to see you as a girl accidentally, anyone that does it is trying to annoy you.
Literally just see a guy I'd like to hang out with or game 🎮
Seems to me you pass very well
you definitely pass my friend!
U defo look 100% like a boy but sadly no older than 14
Omg! You look so good, brother!
I read only a few of the title and I was like *But she does still look like a boy 🥺"" and then I read whole title and I was like ""Wait she actually is he? 😍""
❤️❤️❤️
(Sorry I'm new on Reddit and I didn't see any ftm here yet.)
You barely pass tbh
Lookin handsome dude!🤟😎
wdym you literally pass so well lol
You definitely pass (also as a fellow transmasc I wish I looked like you)
you look very masculine!!! You will get through this
Thank you!! I am a teenage boy tho so that works :)
+1
I thought the same, I really saw a boy when I looked at the picture 😄 passing according to me!!
Thank you so much, that really means a lot. Visiting conservative family always makes me feel dysphoric and just terrible haha
AYY 💪 thank you, kind human!!
do you mean a cis guy? because he is a guy
Thank you omg😭 that means a lot honestly, I feel like I'm overthinking it a lot hahah
Stop this is so sweet thank you so much 😭 I don't know, I feel like my overall frame and especially nose and cheeks look fem
Thank you!! :)
It's mostly by family who refuses to acknowledge that I'm trans, which is why I absolutely hate being here haha. Thank you though!! :D Been really happy with my hair as of late hahah
Thank you so much. It's really hard to fully accept that, and sometimes it really does weigh down on me, but I'm trying my best like everyone else. Again, thank you for your kind words. It really means a lot :)
Idk maybe I'm just being critical because my family keeps saying it😭 but thank you so much!! I bet you're absolutely beautiful :)
Happy cake day!! :D and thank you, that's really sweet :') these comments literally made my night ahah I appreciate this so much
THANK U this is such a big compliment to me😭
STOP. I LOVE THIS SM. Muchas gracias por tus amables palabras :))
Thank you so much :,) I'm trying my best to stay strong and not give up. It's hard sometimes but I'm really doing my best. Honestly, opening Reddit to all of these comments made me cry. This community touches my heart in so many ways. Genuinely, thank you for this, and I wish you the absolute best
Thank you!! :D
SYLVEON GIRLLL :D
Thank you!! It felt so great to finally be able to see myself for the first time in weeks. Almost made me wanna cry with joy hahah. And thank you so much :,) it makes me even happier knowing others see it too
Thank you omg!! And stop, I bet you look amazing dude :,D
If I saw you I would think that's a boy so you 100% pass
You remind me of Hiro Himata from the hair cut, and that's awesome af
Just your hair is a little messy, but I think that's kind of normal for boys your age.
Yepppp. I'm only sane because of an admittedly superb damage control team both intraship and within my little fleet. Gotta love it when you drop anchor in the same port as Bismarck, Blucher, and Leipzeig
Omg yes I'm so sorry I'll fix that
I mean what I said as genuinely as I can say it, genuinely.
You're giving me gender envy I look way too fem to pass as a guy XD
Those characteristics make you look _young._ That's all.

They are not visibly feminizing.
Yw!! Have a good day
No problem man, I know what it’s like. Keep going :)
Thank you
Np
It's no problem bro. Ans stay tough alright 👍
HIIIII IT'S ME AGAIN :D
Well I haven’t really transitioned yet and I recently visited relatives who all misgendered me constantly (I’m not out to them) I still look like a girl in every way possible. My hair is still extremely long, I have curves, my face looks feminine, even if I did transition I would still look like a girl because of my body and voice

Sorry for saying a bunch of sad stuff there and thank you for saying you bet I look amazing
I think I get the reference and I am not proud of it
it’s okay, i just got confused and was ready to fight haha
I MISSED U :D ITS VERY NICE SEEING U AGAIN!!
Sorry for making this suddenly depressing
Hey hey, never apologise for venting. If it makes you feel any better, I haven't really completely transitioned either. Only socially. I'm only 16 so I can't start HRT and I also recently visited relatives who constantly misgendered me, even tho I am out to them. I have a very fem body and lots of curves (my chest is in the late D's), and my voice is extremely fem. Even then, here you are, saying I look like I pass and that you wish you could be me.

Everyone starts somewhere, and that's okay!! That doesn't make you any less of a man, and it doesn't make you any less valid. If you ever need to talk, my dms are open. :D
I just named 3 Kriegsmarine ships, not much of a reference
Thanks for correcting me, while I am also trans, I still am pretty bad with wording things. So correcting me is probably the best way for me to learn the correct wordings.
Thank you so much
Oh...... 👉👈
Of course <3
Of course <3
What did you think the reference was?"	w7xe65	trans	1087	0.98	2022-07-25 19:09:56
Am I not trans? Help!	"I have been feeling like I'm trans for some time now. I have not been getting any serious body dysphoria, but I more thrived on the verbal validation of others.

Recently, I started seeing a psychologist (not because I'm trans) and we got to the topic of gender.

Now, she asks if anything happened to me when I was younger, and I recalled living with my grandparents for a while when my baby brother was born because my mother couldn't take care of the both of us at the same time.

And then she says: ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" 

I'm stumped. What the fuck does this mean?? I mean, the fact that I don't get body dysphoria but if people misgender me I get sad, and then this got me thinking - am I really transgender? 

I know this sounds dumb but am I just coping and cis? When I get therapy will I magically be okay with being a woman? Are my feelings invalid because of early childhood problems?

I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man, and now I feel like my feelings are wrong, I'm lying to myself, and I'm starting to doubt myself again. This is messing with my brain, and I needed to hear the thoughts of other trans folk.

tl;dr - my psychologist told me I was trans because I was ""jealous of my brother getting my parents' attention when I was younger"", and now I'm starting to feel doubt. Any thoughts?"	"Regardless of trans stuff, that’s just bad therapy. Therapists aren’t supposed to tell you their theories flat-out, they’re supposed to let you figure it out on your own. 

OP, if this idea she gave you doesn’t resonate with you and if it doesn’t sound true, that means it almost definitely isn’t. You know yourself better than she does.
Yea nah, that's bullshit. That's borderline conversion therapy, trying to make you believe you're faking it for attention.
Thats just bad therapy. Like other said, a therapist is meant to ask the right questions to help navigate you instead of telling you their own opinions and theories. Just because theyre called a therapist that doesnt automatically make them a proper therapist.
Ummmm yeah this has actually been historically the tactic used on gay people in conversion therapy: that the only reason they are gay was from some trauma as a child. This is obviously not true, and I doubt there is really any evidence this is the case for any gay people or trans people.

I once heard someone say this on trans issues: “if you have been contemplating whether or not you are trans for a while, it means you probably are”

I’d highly recommend talking to either another therapist, or maybe just ask around here on how other trans people feel. I always find that super helpful for getting someone to figure out their own gender identity imho.
At this point i almost want to ask, does it really matter if that is the reason? You say you feel better when spoken to as a boy, for me that is enough to say ""geat then I'll speak to you as a boy"". My own journey was one of discovering the things that made me happy and then labelling came afterwards. I feel happy when binding my chest, and presenting more masc and using the words he/him, so i do just that. It doesn't matter if that makes me cis or trans. I know it can be frustrating to maybe not completely fit in with one label, but in the end, it's all about what makes you happy.
I've been in a similar situation and not having dysphoria doesn't mean you're not trans, but just take your time figuring stuff out sometimes that's all you need and if you don't, ask people for help who you feel safe with or who will accept you. I hope you find what you're looking for.
CHANGE THERAPISTS RIGHT NOW. you are so valid.
You're valid and your therapist is talking shit. I have 2 kids (1 boy, 1 girl) and can guarantee you that kids don't even see gender. My son only started saying ""that's for boys/girls"" when he heard it from other kids at age 3/4 and didn't even form an idea of gender until 5/6. My daughter is 2 and has no clue about gender. If you were 1 you would not have been able to form a conclusion that your brother got your parent's attention because ""he was a boy and you weren't"" (assigned so, at the time, sorry to kind of misgender you there but timelines make it tough). Kids are genderless, in their own mind at least (for a couple years). We gravitate towards what we like. We grow into our gender. We only deny it when society tells us we don't fit its expectations. Sorry for the essay. If you are happy as a boy, then you're a boy.
I mean it‘s easy to answer, isn‘t it? How did you feel at that time, what was it like when you were with your gramdmother?  
How did you feel when you returned home?  
Do you feel the same now?
what kinda Freudian bullshit is this lol. get a new therapist
nah thats bullshit, your valid as heck and shes a bad therapist. 

this is actually a tactic that was used by people to “convert” gay people, they make them question the validity of their identity by saying that the reason why their trans/gay mustve been created from trauma.
Gender euphoria is generally a better indicator than gender dysphoria is. What makes you feel the best? Try some stuff out and see what works. It's all about exploration. You're valid regardless of what you decide is right for you <3
That's not even proper psychology. She is incredibly transphobic, and looking for reasons to tell you it's not real.
I’m not trans… 

But holy shit can I spot a bad therapist a mile away. I don’t know you. I don’t know them.

But a session with your therapist should not have you coming to a question board for emotional therapy, AFTER your therapy session.

Find someone who respects you first.
Your therapist is trash. They often are. Find a new one.
That’s almost like conversation therapy bruh, don’t listen to it and just take your time figuring it out on your own terms or with someone who is accepting, you should really stop seeing this person cause realistically this won’t help you figure out if ur trans or not if ur with someone who by the sounds of it doesn’t like or accept trans ppl
Like others have said, that's not appropriate in therapy. Therapists don't tell you your feelings are wrong and give their version of what's going on in your brain. 

I've struggled with doubts like yours. I've never had anyone say it to my face like that, but I have wondered if I'm not trans but just frustrated with the limitations of being a woman in society (I'm definitely trans). Also 5 years ago I thought I didn't have any body dysmorphia either. I think I was not in touch with my body, because that has changed. But, either way, you don't have to have body dysmorphia to be trans. 

Accepting that you are trans is such a vulnerable position to be in that it's no wonder we doubt ourselves. It might be one of the worst aspects of being trans. Don't feel down if you doubt yourself. I've found it's helpful to think of myself as non-binary. It's true -- I do feel non-binary -- but it also really takes the pressure off of phrases like ""wanting to be a boy"" --- you just wanna be you.
I'm a psychology student. Don't take psychoanalysts (Freud's line of psychology) too seriously, they tend to try to explain what you're feeling from some bullshit occurrence from your past, even though it might not make any sense. There's some truth in trying to find things out from the past, but senseless speculation doesn't get it anywhere. It's always things that apparently make sense, but that can't be proved or disproved. Sure it makes logical sense (?), but that can't in a million years be taken as definitive proof to what you're feeling.

But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn't realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn't know that you're born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity
Nobody knows why people are trans, because it's not an easy topic. 

I know other people have said that the therapist is practicing bad therapy here, but let's hear the therapist out.

What if you are jealous of your brother and wanted to be a boy because of it? You are now an adult who feels happier as a man than you did as a woman.

That's the bit that's functional and meaningful to who you are. Nothing in your past invalidates who you feel like you are today. You are who you are, and you being a man makes you happy.
This bothers me on so many levels. As a trans person, it feels incredibly reductive to reduce something as complex and life-encompassing as identity to a single childhood incident. They're treating your trans identity as a trauma symptom, which is incredibly offensive.

As a trainee therapist, I hate hearing about counselors who allow their ideology to override their professional standards of care. This is the opposite of strengths-based and client-centered; they're treating your identity as a problem rather than a source of strength and telling you what to think rather than letting you take the lead. This person has no business working with queer clients if this is how they approach it.
completely regardless of your transness or lack thereof that is a major therapist red flag
If this were possible, there would be a *lot* more people mistakenly identifying as trans, which we just don’t see. 

You, sir, are almost certainly trans.
Yep, most people already said it, you should either change therapist or just not discuss this with her at all. Dysphoria isn't a requirement for being trans, if you feel like you are a man, then you are a man.
Even if that were true, and it sounds like bullshit, but even if that were, why would it effect who you are now? Regardless of the root cause, you still feel gender euphoria, you still enjoy being referred to as a boy and presenting as such. That doesnt change because your psychologist has a theory. Focus on who you are now, not who you might have been as a child. The child isnt living your life, you are
The best thing someone told me is that gender euphoria is much more important than dysphoria. Feeling good about where you are is much more important than feeling like where you’re at is wrong.

In regards to the therapist, either change or try new another one. If lots of them say the same thing, you might’ve been “jealous” of the attention, but there’s many more steps between “jealous of brother” and “I’m a trans man.” It’s not the “cause,” but it could have opened a new hidden perspective that opened your mind. Childhood memories manifest in mysterious ways. Just know that wanting to be a boy isn’t a bad thing.

At the end of the day, this is about you. Don’t shoehorn yourself into being cis or trans. It’s a long journey, and you can switch back and forth to find that perfect middle if needed.
Everyone else straight up shared my thoughts on gtfa from that psycho.  When I started seeing a therapist because I was worried I was only identifying as trans because I was having a manic episode or something she told me that only I could know that, but did tell me I just seemed happy and I did not seem to be presenting the symptoms of a manic episode.
You need a new therapist/psychologist. You definately are trans, and even if you weren't, that's just bad psychology. Your psychologist isn't you, so they should never be telling you how things made you feel
This is a tactic people have used against gay people for ages. It's the classical ""something must have gone wrong in your childhood and that's why you THINK you aren't straight"".
It's nothing less than a discriminating heteronormative (society expecting everyone to be cis and heterosexual) narrative.
Psychologists should never invalidate your feelings. Have her point you to the research that says being transgender is caused by childhood experiences. As far as I'm aware, no such research exists.
The therapist shouldn't be saying things like that; it sounds like she doesn't understand the trans perspective. I recently had this problem too when looking for a therapist and I realized that even if you aren't going to therapy for trans related issues, it can be a problem that your therapist doesn't ""get it"" for this very reason. If her comment left you saying, ""What? Huh? I feel that way? Really?"" Then it's probably not right. She may be a professional, but without that perspective, she is looking through a biased lens at your problems and offering solutions to what she perceives as a cis woman with trauma. 

At the end of the day, you know yourself the best; you're valid regardless of any opinion, professional or no. Hope you feel better soon, and I hope that this was just a professional blunder on your therapists part.
Regardless of anything, therapists aren't supposed to do that. That exact theory is so full of bullshit that I can't begin anywhere on her thing.
I'm a pre everything trans man and I have almost no disforia (I can't spell and auto correct sucks) but oh boy do I get uforic when people see me as a man. I was smiling all day after some called me brother and I'm depressed as fuck and rarely feel anything other than meh so that day solidified me being trans. Btw what your therapist said sounds like something a shitty tv therapist who was written by someone who hasn't gone to therapy. Please look for a therapist that fits you better.
The absence of dysphoria doesn’t mean you’re not trans.  Focus on the euphoria you get from gender affirmation.  Even if your feelings about your gender were shaped by this event in your early childhood (I’m not saying they were), it doesn’t invalidate the feelings.  There are many ways to look at gender identity. Some say the soul has gender and that it can differ from your physical sex, while others say that the body is simply a canvas for us to make of it what we wish.  I prefer the latter, being agnostic and preferring not to put a definition on the soul.
Your therapist is not a good therapist. You're a man because you were born a man and will stay a man. It's not like you were female and then you became a boy because of your brothers, you're a man and you are valid and you deserve a better therapist. *hugs*
Hello me from whenever I grow enough balls to ask my mom for a therapist (not because of trans things as well). I'm not in your situation yet but remember that not every trans person has body dysphoria also I don't know about you but I did some really egg like things before I found out about that I'm probably trans, to give examples of my own life: I wore dresses to school twice before finding out I'm trans (I'm transfem), in 7th grade I held a presentation about gender swapping in video games, I mostly played female characters in video games. Those examples might not apply to you but maybe you can think of something that you did in the past
that's some of the worst psychology I've ever seen
Please don't speak to that person anymore thats incredibly unprofessional. No life experience can ""cause"" you to be transgender or experience gender dysphoria. You are just trans. Thats all. That person is not only reaching for the stars but is incredibly misinformed and hurting others in the process
Your therapist is not well educated.
Trans is any discontinuity between gender assignment at birth (usually presumed by obvious sex characteristics), and how you feel inside (identity).

It is not required to be a consistent disparity through time.  It is not required to be validated nor negated by confounding or causal factors.

As to the therapist, they are supposed to guide you through your own thought discovery, and not define things for you.  A supposition, “maybe” or “could it be” is the more proper wording from them.

If they are seeking agreement from you, that would be another problem.  If disagreement is a threat to them, that would also be a problem.  You should feel empowered to advocate for yourself, but not required to do so.

In the end, a therapist is someone you can talk about your inner struggles, secrets, etc., who will help you excavate the things you may not realize, or hide from.  If this gets you thinking, then maybe it’s effective.  Questioning yourself is an important part of self discovery.

But, they should have worded this differently.  You should be able to go back and say you are not sure you agree, or even if you do agree, that you can define which parts you actually struggle with vs do not.

Just my thoughts, and not any sort of professional opinion, etc.
Your therapist is probably full of shit, but that doesn't necessarily mean you're necessarily going to benefit from transitioning either. Take a little while to reflect and talk to a different therapist, preferably who specializes in gender therapy
You don't have to have dysphoria to be trans!  I'm sure other comments mentioned that as well but it's so important to remember.  You are valid and you know yourself way better than that therapist.
Oh no freudian psychology
I can’t tell you if you’re trans or not cuz I don’t know a whole lot about you, but it based on the fact that you had no doubts before and you genuinely feel uncomfortable being misgender, it seems like you most likely are trans since the only thing that made you doubt yourself is what your therapist said.

A lot of trans people do struggle with thoughts that they’re “faking” and “just doing it for attention” so you’re definitely not alone! I’d suggest maybe talking to people who have similar thoughts and see what they may do to reassure themselves that they’re trans! 

Lastly, I wanna add that no matter if that’s the reason or not, the fact that you do feel like a boy right now is what’s important. If you do come to the conclusion that you aren’t trans, that’s fine! But for now you do feel like a boy, and as I said, that’s all that really matters!
Do you see yourself being a women in ten years? Do you want everyone to call you she? If the answer is no to those questions then you’re probably trans but just to solidify it.
 Do you want to be your brother or be his brother?
Your therapist is a human piece of shit garbage asshole. You do not need dysphoria to be trans and anyone who thinks that is scientiffically wrong. And also a transphobe. If you think you are trans. You are trans. That's not something anyone but you can decide. Even if they are a therapist. Therapy that makes you more insecure is not therapy. That's bullshit. Sorry for the anger but I genuinenly hate people like that. It just makes you feel like shit. And that's no good.
Ok I can’t tell a lot about trans stuff because I’m still figuring it out myself but one thing I can say is your feelings are NEVER invalid and if you ever need someone to talk to and don’t have anyone close to you to do so (and this goes for anyone) reach out to me
Ignore the therapist. Find a new one.

Only 1 thing determines if you are trans: Do you want to be a different gender than the one you were assigned at birth?

If yes, you are trans. Doesn't matter what else is going on socially or in family dynamics. If you answer yes, you're trans.
If you have no dysphoria of course you’re ‘coping’ with something. You even said it yourself, you thrived off the verbal attention. There isn’t anything wrong with experimenting with your identity or seeking validation.

>I swear, before this I was just a happy trans man

If you were happy, then be happy. If you are trans or not boils down to what you are happy doing. Your therapists sounds kinda transphobic tbh bc she straight up said that you’re not trans. Being trans isn’t something you can tell by looking at someone or even licensing to someone’s whole life story, it’s something only you can figure out if you are or not, if you were happy be happy.
Your psychologist is full of shit, plain and simple. It honestly almost sounds like a retread of old Freudian bullshit - fucking penis envy, for gods' sakes.

You don't want to be a boy because you're jealous of *anyone*. You want to be a boy because you ARE a boy. Dysphoria is complicated and can be hard to unravel when you've been dealing with it for so long it's become background noise that you've learned to automatically filter out. Plus gender is a complicated fuck period. Lack of body dysphoria(or inability to identify such) isn't particularly meaningful.

^((Also ""sad from being misgendered"" is a type of dysphoria, even if it's not body dysphoria.))

That ""thrived on the verbal validation of others"" thing though? That's called gender *euphoria*, the opposite of dysphoria, and it's a pretty good indicator that you are in fact trans.
what kind of freudian bullshit is that psychiatrist on?? drop that bitch as soon as you can. what shes doing is borderline conversion therapy and if you let that go on for a longer period of time you will most certainly get some scars.

and to answer your primary question, if you were happy as a transman and felt good about being reffered as a man then you are a man. not everyone feels dysphoria the same, i myself hardly feel it sometimes but someone else might feel it in a much stronger fashion. what you're experiancing is a light version of imposter thoughts, you know the ""oh i just like x because x im not trans lol"" most trans people have had them a few times in their lifetime. i've had them like twice but thats about it

edit: side note as well, a one year old does not get the thought

""oh my brother gets more love and attention than me, i should be a boy so i can get more love and attention as well""

that just does not happen. and while im not incredibly well versed in childrens psychology i am well versed in adult psychology. (been having classes for 3 years and still going) and something i do about childrens psyche is that thoughts like that are not only rare but also borderline impossible, a child would think

""why is my brother getting more love than me? did i do something wrong?""

then from that you'd be feeling guilt instead of gender insecurity like tf is that psychiatrist on?? im legit fumin babe oh my god

edit2: and now that im thinking about it even more like what the fuck??.

im guessing you're over the age of 15? making you an adult in terms of psychology, so why the fuck is you ADULT PSYCHIATRIST making statements about a CHILDS psyche. oh. my. god. this is so fucked what the hell??? im so sorry you had to go through this absolute dogshit behaviour from a psychiatrist.
That's not a therapist. I don't know what the fuck is up with therapists on the topic of genders, but what they said it's bullshit. If you feel like a trans man, you are a trans man. No changing that
Nothing wrong with being a boy with boobs, and also if that were the reason you would have wanted to be a boy at the time. Like, my kid wants to be a baby because their sibling just got born. Perfectly reasonable. If they come to me in nine years and tell me they want to be a baby, I’m pretty sure the cause would be something else. 

But also, even if that were truly a reason, so what? Wouldn’t make you any less a boy now.
I'll easily put a bet that your therapist is some kind of religious nut too. That is a ""conversion therapy"" response. If it was a sister it would have been - ""You want to be a boy because you were jealous of your sister and therefore resent women as a whole"". If you parents were divorced and you lived with your Dad it would have been because you have had a male upbringing. If you lived with your mum it would have been because you didn't have a male figure and looked to fill that role. It's ridiculous and stupid. Your therapist/psychologist is shit at their job. Tell them to get stuffed and find a better one.
I have found these links quite useful in the past, I hope you do as well.

That therapist is a piece of shit. Fire her as your doctor if you are able and find someone competent who doesn’t have hate in their heart.
Therapist here—

This person is not trans informed, is not sex positive, and doesn’t seem like they are trained in sex therapy.

Most people don’t realize that most therapists receive almost no training in sex therapy or LGBTQ+ issues.

You need a therapist who specializes in LGBTQ+ issues, and hopefully someone who is a certified sex therapist.

Ask your therapist for a referral to a LGBTQ+ therapist and one who is preferably sex therapist certified. She is out of her depths and needed to refer you because clearly she is not trained.

Or, you can look for one yourself! There are many out there! You can even go directly to the AASECT website (certified sex therapist website), they have a list of providers who are certified. 

Source: I am a therapist and specialize in sex therapy. Literally the first thing they teach us in sex therapy certification is that it is a myth that trauma is related to LGBTQ+ status. Just because trauma and queerness are present doesn’t mean they are the cause of each other.
That’s bad therapy my dude. Therapist arnt supposed to just mike drop things like that even if they are true. So I wouldn’t take what she is saying as super credible.
Not every trans person has dysphoria! You’re valid
Bad therapist, find a person who has experience or specializes in gender identity therapy. It's not about finding the people who will say what you want to hear. Being told what they told you is bullshit. This therapist trying to lead you into thinking that aligns with their views not yours. Therapist should never try to lead a client like this. 

My therapist never told me I was as transgender or what my identity was or why I felt the way I did. What they did was help me unpack and unclog the bullshit layers of societies expectations, fears of retaliation and rejection, and self loathing from internalize homo/transphobia until I was finally able to say with confidence who I was. They never told me I was right or wrong, they never tried to justify why I felt this way only to help me understand what I was feeling.

Get a better therapist, they are human and can't be expected to know everything. Avoid therapist who aren't specialized or focused. There are no Masters of All.
That sounds like you need a new therapist. Look for specifically trans-friendly therapists.
1. As a healthcare professional, I’m going to use the magic words…”second opinion!”

2. Unless you’ve been living in some PollyAnna world that is only inhabited by nyan cats spreading rainbows across the sky… you know what kind of attention we are most likely to get…. does the psychologist think something happened to you that was so bad that you would want the often negative attention of strangers?

3. Don’t know your grandmother. But in my family one of my afab and cis cousins was primarily raised by our grandmother. You know what? She is the one enjoying her life. Literally the happiest of all of us. She likely got more attention from grandma than we did from out parents.

4. Like physicians, and nurses, mental health professionals have specialties. This one sounds like she stuck back in DSM-3 where being trans was considered mental illness. If she claims to be a gender expert, she’s not a very good one. I would seek out a mental health professional who actually specializes in gender issues. I have one who specializes in substance abuse, gender and trauma. I don’t need the first but the second and third are fantastic for me. She helped me to make up my own mind, and then gave me her opinion, which was to validate what I decided.
Sounds like you need a new therapist ASAP. Try to find one who is allied with the trans community!
I would already be looking for another therapist, that was dismissive and unprofessional on their part.
Wow, that’s quite the leap your therapist is making. If they seriously thought you experienced some kind of unprocessed trauma and wanted to help you work through that then there are constructive ways of doing that without adding another crisis on top of whatever else you’re dealing with. 

This aside, 1) I don’t think that there’s medical consensus on the idea that being trans is necessarily a trauma response. 2) Say it is some kind of coping mechanism, does that fundamentally change things? People are trans for all kinds of reasons, some social, some physical, some political, etc. Why would the root of **your** transness invalidated that identity? Why should it make you “not really trans” when you experience similar joys and pains to countless other trans people?  3) What is her goal in trying to identify why you are trans, and why is she telling you her theory? The only thing I can think of is that she’s trying to “cure” your transness, and that’s incredibly dangerous. From here I’d imagine she is going to try to logic you out of being trans and use her position of authority and superior knowledge in the field of psychology to convince you that you’re wrong about what you know about yourself. 

This isn’t worth the headache or the heartache. I’d say to just get another therapist.
shit therapist shouldn’t have a license
Well its possible its true i would get a 2nd opinion and also discuss your ""trans confusion"" with  specialized therapist. More importantly don't stress yourself over this people are complex and trauma makes things worse and no one is even near perfect so don't beat yourself up trying to please others
Yeahh, you should get a new therapist
Transphobic therapist
I and nobody, but You can't answer if You are trans or not. Ask Yourself if You feel comfortable with Your gender, or not. No therapist can answer that for You.
I think the therapist You're seeing has some... Weird idea that people become trans, because of trauma, or something. But it's a guess, because statement like that is... Well... Weird at least. But idk think about it. Remember that therapist doesn't know You better than You know Yourself. And they might point You to directions, but ultimately it's You who's got to help Yourself.
That was completely inappropriate of your practitioner to say. Dump them, and find someone new who doesn't assume and jump to erroneous conclusions.
Yeah no your psychologist is full of shit. What they're saying sounds somewhat Freudian and Freud was full of shit too. You don't have to have gender dysphoria to be trans, you only have to have gender euphoria when identifying as a gender other than the one you were assigned at birth. If being a man gives you euphoria, congrats, you're trans!
Don’t search for gender Dysphoria  search for what makes you (gender) euphoric, because we often try to tell ourself nah thats not Dysphoria but it is. By finding stuff that make you euphoric, you get a more positive viewpoint of yourself 😇
never take the advice about who you are from anyone but yourself, you may not be trans one day and that's okay but if you right now think you are, and feel more comfortable being so then you are valid and don't let anyone tell you otherwise.
If the thought of you being not trans makes you anxious, you're trans.
Many cis people have a thought, ""what if im trans?"" But if the thought of you maybe not being trans makes you anxious, you're probably trans.
Btw, it seems like you're mainly experiencing social dysphoria, which is valid. I mainly experience one aspect of body dysphoria which is my chest. Although, I've had an odd gender experience since I have PCOS. When I began to get on birth control to average out my hormones, I began experiencing dysphoria. Apologies for talking about my experiences a bit.


Which makes you most comfortable, most euphoric? Being called a guy, a girl, or a they?
My old therapist tried to say the same thing, but tried saying that since I have ptsd from stuff my cousin and a pedo did that I was probably just using being a boy as a way to keep myself feeling safe. My new therapist though has been very clear that that isn’t a cause of feeling like the opposite gender at all.
Usually, if you're worried that much about faking, you're not faking. You know better than anyone else and even if it can be hard knowing, you're the only one able to tell who you are.
Your therapist either is fake or should be immediately relieved of their therapists’ license, and quite possibly jailed.  You know yourself better than your therapist does, and therapists are literally trained to let you figure everything out on your own with a bit of professional assistance here and there, not to figure it out for you.
A therapist should never tell you how you feel.

Drop them and report them
even if that is the reason, who cares?

If you are happier to identify as a boy, then you are a trans man. no matter how it came to be.

Its not like that's how it works anyway, people don't change their identity over attention. you get far more hate and difficulty living as a openly trans person than you would being cisgender. If you understand that then you aren't faking it.

This is a bigoted psychologist (weather subconsciously or as a conscious decision) trying to invalidate your gender identity. Gender identity is complex and strange and nobody quite knows how it happens or ""how it works"" you cant explain it away with jealousy.
Hot take: so fucking what? I'm gay because my mom didn't love me enough, I'm trans because I was raised religious and women were viewed as lesser. We are all products of our environment, and this cishet bullshit concept that being ""made gay"" is invalid while they simultaneously have conversion camps that try to ""make people straight"" the *exact same way* is disingenuous horseshit. Understanding why you are the way you are doesn't *change* the way you are, nor make it any more or less valid.
This is exactly why you only talk to a therapist that’s a gender identity specialist about gender identity issues. If they don’t, they have absolutely zero credentials to say anything.

What you’re therapist SHOULD have said was they aren’t qualified to give you guidance on this particular topic and looked into places that can.
You know yourself better than anybody! You just have to ponder on yourself and keep like minded people near you! Don’t let someone who went to school a couple of years throw your whole being off. Keep grounded! If you feel your HAPPIER as a trans man, that’s all that matters! We only have one life! Do what feels right for you! She obviously picked at some old wounds for you to be doubtful but don’t worry and continue to live as your authentic self! I too have had family issues and it really hurts. I understand in my own way how that feels. I have half sisters. They got all the attention as well. That doesn’t change who I am though. It does however make me a loving mother to my two girls. Keep your head high. Keep doing you dude!
You don’t need body dysphoria to be trans I’d seek a psychiatrist that specializes with gender identity !
The human brain is dumb... it only wants what it can't have because it's greedy.  

If you want to be transgender, then it tells you otherwise because one is always contradicting the other.  

Your feelings and your brain hate each and life is a constant, never-ending war of unsatisfaction.
That that's the first thing she said after hearing about one experience... That's not therapy, that's conversion, and you need to get the hell out of there. I'm really sorry this happened to you, I understand it must be incredibly confusing. Trauma can absolutely cause gender fuckery, but it's not at all the first go-to explanation for feelings like yours and it's definitely not something a therapist should be looking for (""how can I disprove this person is trans?"")
“If people misgender me, I get sad.” That’s dysphoria.
Your psychologist is full of it.
1. your therapist is a bitch 
2. not getting dysphoria doesn’t make you any less trans. i don’t get dysphoric about my genitalia, but that doesn’t make me any less trans
Honestly, who fucking cares if you are “really” trans, or if childhood trauma “made you” trans, both of which are bullshit— but even if they were true, if being a man makes you *truly* happier. That being a man feels better than being a woman ever did, and it is who you want to be, then you are a man.
Is sad so many psichologists are really bad professionals, I had problems with one of them because she called that I'm a trans woman just by hating men in general, so in her theory I hate men and of course can't be one. (I'm married with a cisgender man and very happy with him)
One of my favorite youtubers likes to say: if you think you‘re faking it, there‘s a pretty good chance you‘re not :)
Having dysphoria doesn’t equate to being trans. It‘s also not a cis thing to like being called the opposite gender, just saying…
What if a friend of yours told you a story like that? How would you react? Would you judge them and their feelings? 

PS: I‘m in a similar situation (little to no body dysphoria, pretty pronounced social dysphoria) and you really help me work through this, thank you!
Yea dude that's kinda dumb. I'm not a therapist or phycologist but I have been around plenty of people who want attention they lacked and they usually just fallow what they're told cause they seek approval and even if that therapist was somehow in your head knowing everything going on in there it's not ok to just tell someone oh yeah the way you live is invalid cause blah blah blah. I had it happen with my parents. I don't get why but it feels as if they just don't want you to feel comfortable. And on top of all of that not every trans person experiences the same thing this includes body dysphoria. Some people just get the euphoria side of it and that doesn't make them any less of themselves so for your therapist to be making such bold claims without knowing much on the subject is pretty unprofessional (I know it's sorta hypocritical to say this while not having official knowledge of psychology but I'm just saying that is that if you're making someone mentally battle themselves instead of helping that not happen you're not doing your job right so yea that therapist may be bias against you or she just doesn't understand trans people that well) hope that you have o good rest of your day bro.
If it's okay with you, I would really like to share this with my therapist and get their perspective on it. Bc this is bullshit and you need some validation.

To be perfectly clear, if you feel more comfortable as a male then that's what you are, no one else has any say in the matter.
Nah this is a homophobic trying to talk you out of it
Report this therapist, they are completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
That “therapist” is total garbage. You don’t need to have body dysphoria to be trans! I once heard someone describe it as, if you somewhat tolerate vanilla ice cream, but love chocolate ice cream and feel super happy when you eat it, why would you stay with vanilla? No one can tell you you’re trans except for yourself!
Phsycologists r assholes in my experience, always enjoyed my sessions with therapists over ones with psychologists
A cis person wouldn't worry about being trans or not
Being trans isnt about hating what you were born with, it's about building yourself into something you love. Whether you get dysphoria or not doesnt determine your transness- I'm willing to bet you're exactly like me (and many, many other trans people) whose experiences are more shaped by gender euphoria (joy at your gender) rather than dysphoria.

I think many people, both within and outside of the trans community, focus too much on the pain of dysphoria rather than acknowledging the beautiful joy of euphoria and shaping your life and growing in a way you control. 

The way people outright ignore gender euphoria in many places sets a warped perspective towards trans people and how we 'should' experience our lives and connection to gender rather than seeing the true rainbow of diversity that all communities contain, which, sadly, tends to steer our siblings who don't fit into the mold of 'dysphoric trans person' away from the community.

I hope you find a better therapist my dude, and I hope you grow more assured in your own identity* as you march on into the future. (*whatever it may turn out to be and however many times it may change and adjust, cause life and labels really do like to play around, lol)
No cis person has those thoughts 😃
Yeah that's dumb. And, really, the concept of whether you're ""really trans"" or not is kinda silly too - all that matters in the end is that you feel happier as a man, and you're not hurting anyone by that. Why the feelings exist is pretty much irrelevant, if you feel them they're there and they're real and that's that
What the fuckl?!?!?!? 

Im absolutely appalled 

dump them
Oh, hell no. I don’t have dysphoria, only a little before I started T, now I’m fine. I don’t experience severe dysphoria my ex has. Don’t doubt yourself. You know yourself better than anyone in the entire world does, even if you’re still navigating. That psychologist doesn’t know shit. 

My mom did the same thing; she listed things out, and I doubted myself, but I was upset, so I wasn’t thinking straight, and later my mind became clear. I KNOW I’m a male, and my mom is anti-LGBTQ+. She’s religious.
your psychologist needs to have their license revoked.
Get a new therapist ASAP!! Look for one that specializes in trans issues.  They seem to be the most helpful in the subject of gender.  My therapist said that feeling of ""what if I'm not or feeling like I might regret it is normal.  She's helped me understand that that is my anxiety speaking and helped me realize that I've had suppressed memories of me trying to express my true gender
Yeah, that therapist is wrong. Social dysphoria is just as valid as body dysphoria (in addition to the fact you don’t need dysphoria to be trans) I’d say find a different therapist.
Nah you're trans  what a shitty psychologist
OP you need a new therapist that's all I have to say
I would counter with your psychiatrist. If you give up then they are right. They are just summarizing what you said. It’s open for debate if you like, or do you just wanna leave it at that? Don’t allow the medical fearmongering on Reddit lead you astray. Remember this is your business. If you are transgender and looking for a reason why then there is your answer. However, if you are trying to resolve your dysphoria there is your answer. Just bc you have gender dysphoria doesn’t mean you are transgender. So the opposite is true, as well. This is what medicine is good at. Weeding out your internet dives and misconceived notions you’ve gathered from the internet. As someone who has to drop their knowledge at the door I have trained myself to be a patient when I’m a physician, as well. Doctors make the worse patients so when you are diagnosing yourself physicians see that, and go with that. Leading you to get to your own answers. Take each session with a grain a salt bc it won’t be fixed in one session unless you want it to.
You should report this therapist for completely invalidating you with their bullshit “assessment”.
Let's put aside the fact that no one can tell you if you're trans or not, and \*let's say\* that it would be possible to feel that way bc of trauma. Even if we do that ""You want to be a boy because you saw your brother getting all the attention and got jealous."" is the worst, weakest and the most naïve take I could ever imagine.

This is actually one of the qualms I had with Jules' special episode on euphoria, where she's in therapy. At one point the therapist just kinda makes a connection and interrupts Jules instead of just letting her talk. Like childhood experiences are important, but I think even still a lot of Freudian-esque bullshit makes its way into media representations of therapy and even some actual therapy, trying to make some sort of profound connection instead of actually trying to address the issue.
This resonates a lot with me. I've started to think of my journey as the Marie Kondo Trans Experience. You basically start out by accepting ""these things spark joy, I will do them. These other things do not spark joy, and I want them to go away."" Eventually I cleanly fit into a label, but I didn't have that clarity until I started living the parts I knew. My identity keeps getting clearer over time as I'm on HRT and presenting female, and I'm finally starting to have a picture of the future in my head that I'm actually looking forward to.
Thank you so much. This, and all the other comments, really means a lot to me.
Absolutely agree. My 3 year old nephew loves Disney/cartoons and make believe. Sometimes he changes his name to Olaf or Mario and insists everyone call him this, other times he has been Anna, Elsa, Raya and insists on those names. We let him be whatever name is flavor of the day.
That's the catch, though. At the time, I was a little over 1 year old, so I don't remember it at all. 

As for my feelings, I've started feeling 'different' when I was around 12. I think you see my problem now.
Gender euphoria really is like putting on glasses for the first time. Like ""holy shit normal people just... feel comfortable sometimes? In their own bodies?""
>But there is also the possibility that your psychologist is just not educated enough on trans stuff, and that they didn’t realize how harmful that comment could be. Maybe they didn’t know that you’re born trans, and tried to give it an explanation, but still totally support you as trans. In the sense that they were not trying to actually deny your trans identity

Sure, this is the more charitable take. But even if this is what’s going on (which is a pretty big if) the therapist has shown that they are not qualified to help OP. Look at how much her saying this fucked with the poor dude. He went from happy and confident to feeling invalidated because an authority figure told him is entire identity is, essentially, made up. That’s wildly, immorally irresponsible even if it was true, and she’s also very obviously shooting from the hip with pseudoscientific bullcrap.

It’s easy to make trans people doubt themselves - in the world we grew up in, we’re constantly erased, disrespected, questioned, gatekept and belittled.

The bottom line is that this person should not be a therapist, period. They are not qualified. OP, please don’t let this clown plant doubts in your mind. You are valid. ❤️
It's bad therapy because there's no evidence for such a thing. The whole ""looking for attention"" is transphobic propaganda. How many trans people have *actually* just been looking for attention and not really been trans?
If you wanna add it to your autocorrect, the spelling is ""dysphoria."" It's the opposite of euphoria, which should be a word most autocorrects will get right.
Please do not restrict enbies to “in the middle” or “in between” the genders accepted by the binary gender system. Yes, some non-binary peoples identities do fall into that space but there’s so much more than simply being the purple to men and women’s pink and blue. We are all the colours on the colour spectrum apart from pink and blue, from purple to green to yellow to periwinkle to ultraviolet and infrared. 

I would like to know where you think that quack was coming from when you say their words shouldn’t be discredited. How does it work for a one year old to go through something that made them want to change their gender for attention eleven years later? If you’ve been having to put up with a therapist who pulls shit like this on you and you’re just gaslighted, please know that you deserve better than a therapist talking to you like this.
This OP. It sucks to start again but I think you should browse for a new therapist and report this one for invalidating you. Im in college and gender identity is no longer a question of your “beliefs” or “politics” or “religion” . Gender  identity is becoming a part of human biology and development classes, inclusivity studies are mandatory if you want your papers in my country as a clinical psychologist. Sounds like this therapist needs to update their education.
Yeah sometimes they forget that its an individual and the book doesnt always apply 100%
I had one therapist who tried to make conclusions from just a fraction of informations and i knew that i had to change the therapist cuz their opinions and theories just didnt fit me at all and I knew they didnt even hear the full “story” of me (this wasnt gender related but still similar situation)
Exactly how it feels to me too, well said
So she says you were envious without any proof or indication thereof?
Come on, you were 1 year. You probably didn‘t even compute what happened to you, let alone have the logical capacity to conclude „Oh it‘s because of my brother!“.  

Seems a little farfetched imho.
Lol, my euphoria ranges from a shot of happiness whenever I get a haircut or addressed as my gender to a unicorn blasting rainbows out of its ass at mach 10 to fly over the moon, wagging its tail like a puppy.

I swear I'm an adult- but sometimes wearing clothes I like brings out my inner labrador, lol.
The ""looking for attention"" idea is also inherently backwards. Do those people really think ANY of us enjoy the immense and horrible backlash we get for being trans? Is that enjoyable and worth seeking if it's not necessary? If I am looking for attention, I tell jokes or climb on a table and dance. I don't put a bullseye on my back so people can trample me.

The idea also thoroughly erases the existence of stealth trans people. How would we get attention from being trans if we're stealth? It makes no fucking sense.

All we want is to be happy as our authentic selves. Fuck this tyranny.

One year olds surely do not even have a concept of gender, let alone what a brother is or jealousy.
OP said they were a happy trans man until a quack said something stupid, you think that’s questioning? Since you’re defending the stupid that was said by the therapist then explain the mechanics of how what happened to him at a year old made him want to change gender for attention eleven years later. If it “resonates” so well with you that you think that it even needs consideration then please explain why everyone with a sibling doesn’t become trans to their sibling’s assigned gender? 

It’s not about resonating or not resonating. It’s about a therapist saying something incredibly stupid and abusive.
Now you’re a psychic on top of it? Nah, I’m done here, since you seem to know everything but won’t answer as to why you know these things this isn’t a productive conversation."	s4gmja	trans	1082	0.98	2022-01-15 09:27:19
I’m starting to realize the outcome of me being trans	"I’m 17 (MtF she/her) and realized I was trans 2 years ago and came out to my parents about it a year ago. They were extremely resistant about the idea but thankfully my mom came around and generally accepts me. My dad on the other hand is a closed book to the fullest. I don’t want to explain more than I have to but he is extremely transphobic and homophobic towards me as a result. 

I talked to them a bit about wanting to medically transition and while my mom was open to the idea my dad was furious. They both got into a heated discussion about it and eventually they decided to decline me the care I needed. My mom just abandoned me there for my dad because she felt it was the right thing to do for the general good of the family. I understand her sentiment but I just feel so betrayed because of it. 

Everyday I resent them more and more for how they treat me from not using my name, misgendering, and turning blind eyes to every scenario possible. I’m almost 18 and about to set out on my own but as I’m starting to get my stuff together I realize more and more that why I’m doing and what I need to do is something that they would never approve of. I seek my independence from their unforgiving behavior and am starting to realize the consequences it will create. They always yapped to me about family and doing what’s right but from what I seen of them they only look out for themselves. 

Now that I’m looking out for myself and my identity they are becoming increasingly more hostile towards my abandonment of their beliefs and I know it. They wish for nothing but what they want but I won’t let it happen. I deserve to create agency for my identity and my life as who I am in my own way. This abandonment will leave me without a family, inheiretence, money, or relationships but that’s a sacrifice i’m willing to take. They never supported me and I know they never will but I know that I have to do this for myself. I have to do it for her."	"Right on.  You’re the one who lives your life, not them.
This is a powerful ode to liberation. What you have recognized  I believe is a gift. Not that many of us find the ability or good fortune to be able to stand in complete naked, transparent, and unflinching solidarity with our true self for all around us to see. 

The relationships around us reshuffle as we become aware of the true meaning of love and we recognize who loves us and who doesn't. Because to truly love is love without ulterior motives, to love one not for what they do or how they fit into our lives, or what they do for us, but for who they are. 

This seems simple, but when we are not being our own authentic self, we are unable to recognize all the relationships in our lives founded on falsity, or all the ways convince ourselves that we are loved even by those who really don't love us at all. We are a bit like the King of Rohan with our eyes covered in cataracts and evil voices of ""loved ones"" whispering in our ears what we feel and who we are.

When I cane out as trans, already most of the family relationships I had had melted away. Shortly after, I lost the last one. Don't get ne wrong, I did some of the pushing away. Being trans is kind of a superpower. 

It snapped into sharp focus the idea of the dark side of love that this person dwelled on in the way the hay treated me for so many years! I saw them for who they are! 

I like this song by Palace Brothers ""No More Worhorse Blues"". The workhorse is the perfectl metaphor for the person who lives their life for others until they change their mind and realize they must live their own life and throws off the yoke of their work to be ""a grazing horse...a racing horse...your favorite horse!"" Everyone's musical taste is different and although the musical zeitgeist of the early 90s raw indy voice and guitar may not be to your liking, I hope you can hear the lyrics. I will post this elsewhere.

 I hope you forge ahead becoming you, strong and lovely and super powerful. You are loved and will be loved. You have the unique gift of recognizing how truly alone most of us really are. Love is real when you feel it from here.
If you have known this for two years. I don't imagine that this will ever go away. She will never leave you, as she is you. 
Take care, be careful this is a long hard road. Keep an eye on education as you move through this as it is a powerful tool to give you the resources to be successful with everything even your transition. 
I wish you a peaceful transition.
Unfortunately, this is a reality many of us face. It's difficult, but we get through it, and we build families of choice along the way. That said, I will give you a bit of practical advice as I've been where you are before. 

1. You're about to turn 18. It is important to prioritize your transition, but it is also important to prioritize your next steps into adulthood. Are you planning on going to college? Do you have somewhere safe to live and some money saved up? The freedom you will experience when you leave your parents' house will be wonderful, but you'll also need to prioritize your safety and wellbeing (insurance, housing, a phone, etc.). I know many people who made the decision to not totally disown their parents until they were completely financially independent. It did not keep them from being out to their friends and colleagues at college, and it kept them safe until they could provide for themselves 100%.
2. Some parents come around. Some never do. I am completely no contact with my father. There will come a point where you may have to say ""I cannot accept this type of treatment and therefore, I will not spend time around you unless your behavior changes."" For me, it was valuable to be able to say to my father, ""I have warned you of these consequences and your behavior remained unchanged."" And then... our relationship was over. And I was free. And honestly? It's better than I could've ever imagined.
3. Which brings me to this point. Right now, everything seems so big and so scary. And in many ways, it is. But please believe me when I tell you, your life will contain so much more joy and love than you could ever dream of. You will meet so many wonderful people and find so much peace in getting to live more fully into yourself and get to know the young woman that you are. The work you are doing now will pay off, whether it is preparing for college or beginning to calmly set boundaries with your parents. I wish you the best on this journey, but seriously, it's not all gloom and doom. It's gonna be okay- it's gonna be better than okay- it's going to be really, totally wonderful.
You know who they truly are now. Pretty sad and disappointing to realize. Still, you will always go further with the truth. Go for it young adult!💕❤️😊
I am not sure if it helps; but quietly asserting your right to ownership over your own body is a part of becoming a woman, and its a stressful time for cis and trans women alike. Sure there are unique challenges to being trans, but there are also unique challenges for cis girls. 

My point is, find reassurance that what you’re going through is unfortunate and scary but normal, and if you approach it as such it will get easier for folks around you to accept you. People (even parents) respond to confidence. Keep your cool, don’t give them the fight they want but keep your focus and go toward what you want. You’ll get it 🥰
This is so relatable did our parents get a ""unsupportive course"" or something
Good on you for realizing this. I turn 30 in a few months, and after going no contact for several years with my parents, I tried so hard to make things work, but absolutely nothing changed with them after 5 years of no contact with a 2 year reconnect. I finally blocked them yesterday, and this time I know it is the right call, and today I feel free. Some people are absolutely capable of change, but it is not your responsibility to manage them, and your health is the most important in your life. 
You deserve to be respected, and treated nicely! I hope you have a good day! c:
It's terrible that so many people have to give up their families just to get proper medical treatment, but as much as it hurts, it will be for the better. They are selfish, and you deserve happiness. ❤️
Make damn sure you can fully support yourself (food, shelter, utilities, job) and have an external support network (friends willing to, say, let you crash at their place for a month) before you burn that bridge. Take what your parents are willing to give you, hold love and forgiveness for them in your heart without compromising your boundaries, and be prepared to live your truth! You are you, and nobody can take that away from you.
Insert* ""you do it for her"" lyrics -steven universe
I’m proud of you, girl. My dad was/is also a homophobic and transphobic POS, and I was nearly twice your age when I started my medical transition: still loving every minute of it.

Like you, I lost all support and chances of inheritance: I currently live in a camper and wait tables @36. The comfortable life I could have had came with too many strings attached, and I would rather be a poor trailer park girl than a middle class repressed 🥚.

Follow your heart, and live your best life. Also capitalism must be destroyed.

🖤💖🏴🏳️‍⚧️🏴💖🖤
If you disappear for a while after you turn 18 it’s possible your mother will come around.
Good for you. Live your best life, sis. 

If parents can’t support who their kids are, the kids aren’t going to stick around.
Absolute goddess mentality 🫡 

I’m really sorry your parents are transphobic. That sounds agonizingly difficult and I wouldn’t even begin to know what to do in your situation. You are an incredibly strong woman. She will prevail ✊
Your situation is sad but not uncommon.  In the end, you'll have to live the life you desire....one that fits you best.  Life is really short and being happy cannot be undervalued.  There's hope you'll find peace with your parents.  My experience was similar to yours but because my parents divorced long before my transition they didn't have their own marriage to save.  Mom was supportive and dad was not.  I pressed forward and did what I knew was best for me.  Fully transitioned......including work etc.  Everything worked out over the course of some years.  I have high hopes it can for you as well.   If possible, try not to be too angry with your parents.....they'll need time.  In the meantime, begin making your plans with the assistance of anyone in the right places to help you.
I am on the same boat. However, I’m almost 22 in two months and still live with my parents. I’ve been out for 4 years and medically transitioning for nearly 2. In the meantime of trying to get accepted into a job and doing what I can around the house, my family makes my transition about themselves. That I’m “selfish” and that the entire world doesn’t revolve around me, and if someone declines to call me my preferred name and pronouns, that’s “their boundary”. Any boundaries I make regarding to being respected gets thrown out the window. I either have to submit to being called my deadname and “she” all day, or resort to unnecessary drama all because of a fucking name and pronouns. My mom is trying to come around but resorts back to deadnaming and misgendering, it’s a frustrating cycle. 

My advice is apply to as many good paying jobs as possible. Save up and move out when you can.
You have to pay attention to that hostility. That is the dark side of love right there. That is the true face of their love, a self-serving love betrayed. The veil is lifted and maybe the first time in your life, they are showing you a deep essence of their true self, maybe the most sincere thing they ever showed you, next to the joy they expressed when you most perfectly matched or exceeded their expectations. 

But I think it's important at the same time to see it with some compassion and some hope and to not mistake it for the totality of their love. They may change. Limbic creatures detest change and will fight it tooth and nail, but some of us are also eventually capable of being human.
If youre in the US they are legally required to have you inherit 1/3rd of their money if you are their next of kin.
so much love and strength to you. ❤️
You are such a strong woman
I'm so sorry you are on this situation. I came put at 45 completely independent and kind of had the same reactions. Mom not comfortable and dad rejecting. Eventually my mom came around but dad is stuck in transphobia. My mom is avoiding to take much sides and ultimately she lives with him. If I had come out at your age I would have had the same situation that you are having plus violence. 
It's sad to realize you are losing them more every day but in the other hand you are working on your own happiness. You won't be happy without transitioning, so you better understand what lies ahead of you. 🫂
I'm so sorry you're in this situation. I'm in something similar. My parents are less outright hostile, and I""m older, but it rings true too. Please, when you are able to get out of there cut them out of your life and don't look back.

Your family sucks, but it won't be the same. You will make a new one. You'll find people that actually care about you and make you feel happy. People call the concept a found family, but regardless it's real. <3

PS: Make sure you have your documentation, like your ID and birth certificate, any money you have earned, and anything else with you just in case. Some people can be cruel. And that their names aren't on any accounts you have. If you have a bank account as a minor I believe you have to have a parent/guardian open the account with you.

Good luck. You'll be able to be yourself soon enough. <3

Been there, good luck on your journey, it's a difficult one, but definetly doable!

Quick tip: make sure the place you move to can be set as your homeadress, otherwise your parents will get your post, and can use this against you.
I’m so sorry man. Goodluck, do it for yourself. People who truly love and care about you for you will come around.
Same lol
Same lol
You're already so self-aware and that's a great start! I'm really hoping you have somewhere to go at 18, because I wouldn't live with them 1 minute more than I have to. For them to deny you that is cruel at best, these are the types of parents that claim to be good parents but then wonder why their kids don't talk to them. Trust me, this is tragically more common than it should be. But you've already got a great head on your shoulders, I know you'll do great out there! And once you find a space of your own a massive weight will be lifted from your shoulders. Hang in there!
are you me? this is my exact situation, ages and everything. i will read the comments religiously
I get that feeling. No family or friends close enough to call that.
That's so strong of you, I could benefit from a fraction of the guts you have 💜🙏🏻
This post gave me a lot of hope. I’m also seventeen, and in a nearly identical situation where my parents don’t accept me, especially medical transition. My parents have the same dynamic as well. I’m FTM not MTF but I’ve never related to a post more. You’re not alone OP, and I wish you a lot of luck. ❤️
do it for her!! YES!! i’m so sorry this is happening, and i’m so sorry it’s such a relatable and universal experience for most of us. i’m wishing you only the best for yourself!
Thank you for making this. I'm in a similar position and christ this made me feel like what I'm doing with myself actually makes some sort of sense haha. I'm still getting used to being me and this really did help me. I wish you the best of luck, and seriously thank you for making this. I'm sure I'm not the only one who needed to read this. Just remember you're never alone and that you're also a total badass in my eyes :)
I legit had to look my father dead in the face and say, ""you either accept me as your son and stop your shit, or you can bury me in the ground and have no children"" course I was 21 but it still hit him hard and made him think about what I ment to him.
I'm sorry to hear that :(
If it's of any help, I'm a trans girl about to turn 17 and dms are always open if you need someone to talk to 💜
Happy cake day
Thank you, I appreciate the kind words.
Wow this is a beautiful comment.
This is really good advice! Prioritize your education; it will make transitioning much easier and will make it easier to find other trans people and sources of support and found family.
This comment is so beautiful, I love this community so much
Thank you for saying that. I will admit the journey ahead is gonna be pretty rough but I’m willing to accept whatever comes my way to secure my happiness.
I can’t describe how much it pains me to have to live into my older years and look back on a childhood I never had. The fact that all of that was denied from me and actively so, hurts so much. I feel like if my dad could, he would be actively more violent towards me being trans but thankfully the laws are a thing. I just can’t shake the feeling that I have to inevitable live with all this baggage that I feel no one will ever be able to truly understand.
Delete this shit.
Am nearly 40, the only thing that hit me like a rock is how sweet my life is without kids.
I think he’s just transphobic. And this comment is generally pretty dumb.
Op is the only one who decides if they have children or not. Pretty simple right?
You're so very welcome.
Thank you 🙏

It’s an overwhelming generalization based on your personal experience. Some people have kids in their twenties. Some people have kids in their teens. Some people never have kids. Some people choose to bank sperm in their twenties because they’ve fully and seriously considered the kinds of family planning they want to do. Some people just wing it. Some 18 year olds do what is best for themselves. Some 18 year olds make big, stupid choices. Any post that generalizes about what everyone does in their 20s is a pretty dumb. Don’t you think?
I briefly went through your profile history/comments and noticed you casually dropping slurs such as the f slur and the r slur. After a dumb comment like this i had to check and now im curious why are you even here?
Based on what you're saying op would already be familiar with this concept so ... What are you adding to this conversation? Rather than just distracting from ops valid points by implying they should sacrifice their mental heath for their parents opinions and biasis. And your own opinions and biasis.

Just got deadnamed in front of my homophobic class (mtf 17)	"So, i just got misgendered by the substitute in my most homophobic class of the day in the worst way possible. She was calling role, and when she came to my name she said my deadnamed, and paused. I wasn't paying attention because I'm not used to it, but everyone stops talking. Then, she repeats it,looks me dead in my eyes and says ""You're *deadnamed*, right?"" 

She looked mad at me too...


I just want to curl up and cry, I've been dealing with some serious dysphoria since yesterday and this has made everything fucking way worse

Edit: I generally know how to handle these things, but thanks for the advice. Today has just been a rough day in totality, and that really didn't help. This post may be removed soon though because of the hateful DMS and comments I've been receiving. If me venting about an experience that upset me under the vent tag upsets you that much, then I think you're far more sensitive than me.

Edit 2: The substitute is very regular, and I've had her multiple times. She doesn't respect my name."	"I can only imagine the reasons she was mad for you responding to roll call is either not know and thinking you were “disrespectful”, simply hates you for being trans, or some combination of both.
This happened to me on my first day of classes. My solution: don't respond to it. It isn't your name. Speak with the teacher after class to correct them and make sure they mark you as present.

I am really sorry this happened to you. I hope you're doing okay. You're very strong for being out and presenting at this age, in this particular climate, I hope things go better next time.
Teachers like this are honestly the worst, seemingly only existing to spite their students.  
When I was in school, I would spite all the students I disliked, but I feel like I'd make an exception for this teacher...and no doubt get sent to the principle for saying ""Sorry Mr. Dickhead""
I know this is a stretch, but does your school have any policy that supports trans youth using a chosen name? You could report them.

If that’s not an option, I’m sorry you’re in a tricky position. Regardless having a class full of bigoted kids and a teacher equally bigoted that all know your deadname sounds terrible. I hope you can go to someone in your life who can support you.
""No, I'm *chosen name.*""

The end.
report that to your school officials.  they can blacklist her from ever subbing there again (assuming they support you)
I'm going to say this in the most polite way I can this morning....fuck her! I would have said my name is x thank you, but I forgive you. People can be so shit sometimes. Hugs Honey
Misgender them back. Call them by a wrong name or their maiden name even. Lol

edit: /s but when they've done it multiple times, let them swallow their own medicine.
I wasn’t there so I don’t know full context but is it possible your deadname was simply what was listed on the attendance sheet? If it was truly malicious then fuck him, but I’ve had people deadname me simply because they didn’t know or had old info on me. It feels awkward af and makes me slightly uncomfortable but I have to remember it was an accident and simply politely correct them. It’s only unless they refuse to accept the correction that I let myself get upset with them. Same thing with gendering, some people have used “he” for me but only because they were strangers and thought I was FTM, not mtf and actually trying to be supportive. I was giving off very androgynous vibes early in transition most strangers truly couldn’t tell my assigned gender at birth as I have a naturally effeminate yet only slightly deeper than cis female voice. I just corrected them and told them my pronouns and suggested they ask first to avoid confusion and had zero problem. We can’t be mad at ignorant people, only the ones who go out of their way to keep others ignorant or insist on remaining so after being confronted with the truth. But like I said if it was really malicious then fuck him and I support u girl. Sometimes it’s just hard to tell I know cause I’ve been in your spot plenty of times.
My respect i wish the Best for you ❤️
I'm so sorry that happened to you! I'm actually a substitute myself, and dead naming a student is one of my worst fears. Some teachers are nice enough to provide a list of preferred names and pronouns in the notes they leave, but some don't, and the school only uses legal names on the rolecall sheet. I always tell students to correct me if I use a name they don't prefer, but I know that doesn't always make it easier. 

I obviously don't mean to defend your sub. It sounds like they were malicious and transphobic. Screw them, and you definitely should mention the incident to your regular teacher when they're back.
You should call transphobic teachers whatever you want and if you get in trouble just claim that your ‘deeply held religious convictions’ demand you call them that.  They can’t ask you to define/defend your ‘deeply held religious convictions’:
Happened to me about an hour ago. Fucking sucked. Nobody in my class knew my deadname two hours ago and now they all do.
Report the sub. Please. Have them lose their teaching license. What they did is not ok.
“You’re <deadname>, right?”
“Err, no, I’m <realname>”
Devil's advocate: Is your deadname listed as your name in the school's roster? If she had a list of every student's name, and your deadname instead of your preferred name was on the list, then it's not necessarily the substitute's fault. Is there any way she could have known what your preferred name was?
[removed]
I would’ve went nope never was. I don’t take your calling me by the wrong name lightly. so I’d probably have it out to make her day hell
Thank you so much for all the support <3 Schools over now so I'm just going to be lazy and have a mental health day now.
You don't deserve to go through any of this, And we're here for you. As for the people being twats in your DMs, They need to chill the hell out. Everyone has different experiences and values. Someone else's threshold being different doesn't give them a right to be mean to you for yours.

None of us know what anyone else is going through or why something hurts the way it does.
I am so sorry. Hopefully better days are ahead.
I’m sure that she just called out the register and that was the name she had been given for you, I highly doubt that she deliberately called you it. She is a substitute and so likely doesn’t know you or any of the other students.
Yeah this. I had to fill out some paperwork and such, but my school changed my name in their entire system. Teachers don't even get to know my deadname (unless they had me before I got it changed) and it's really helpful.
I think their gender looks something like this 🖕 and it should continue looking like this until they learn respect
Personally not a fan if this method because using pronouns/gendered language as a weapon isn't helping anyone and if anything can lead people to the idea of withholding gender recognition as a punishment.
I'm glad someone else thought of this. A substitute isn't going to know what everyone prefers to be called unless it's marked down. It's a very real possibility your name isn't mentioned in an obvious place (such as listed in the attendance sheet in place of your deadname). It's more likely that this sub had no way of knowing your name rather than it being full on malicious. 

It really sucks though, especially with the type of people you're classmates are.
Love this
Honestly, yea, same

Edit: Name checks out, lol
”I use misgendering to destroy misgendering”
It also tells your trans friends that your respect of their gender identity is contingent upon them keeping you in their good graces."	x85kec	trans	1054	0.96	2022-09-07 13:46:27
Do you still misgender yourselves sometimes?	Edit: wow, this really got attention, thanks everyone for sharing your experiences, feel free to reach out if you need someone to talk to since I read a bunch of bad experiences	"I'm not publicly out yet so that might contribute to it but I often compare and liken myself myself to other men.

edit: did it again haha, I meant ""I compare and liken myself to men""
I do occasionally even though I've been fully out for over 4 years... I think some of that has to do with living with my dad still and he still occasionally misgenders me by mistake.
Only all the time.  This must mean I'm secretly cis and just faking for the attention right?  The fact that I feel better after a year on HRT and I get super excited about the fact that I have boobs now is just something all guys do right?

I hate my brain sometimes.
I still do, quite frequently. The times when I mess something up and call myself out is when I most commonly misgender myself.

There’s also sometimes when I do something totally boss, I still have the impulse to quote Super Troopers and say “I AM ALL THAT IS MAN” before catching myself.

I’m so glad other people do this too. It can be really discouraging when the slip-ups happen, like it’s evidence I’m not “really” trans, and can lead to some negative self-talk.
I do. Its the worst.
Yes and i start wondering my validity and have a breakdown.
I'm not out yet, so yes, all the time. If I can help it I will switch ""he"" with ""they"" when I'm telling a story about something someone said about me. I do it in my head a lot too.
Yep all the time, not with my name but I will sometimes refer to myself as “she” when I’m thinking and I have to do a double take
On occasion, a bigger problem for me is sometimes I hesitate to actually call myself a woman, which sucks
Often. I expect it happens less the long and farther in to transition you are.
Yes sometimes I accidentally say “he.”
sometimes because my parnets dont accspect me and use my dead name and wrong prnous...so i sometimes mess up because of that
I think it goes both ways for me.

For more distant family I am not out to... I've accidentally NOT misgendered myself.

And then other times I accidentally do.

My brain just sorta auto-pilots to one or another randomly.
yes but not out loud/in public
Yes. I’ve been out for over 4 years, and I still occasionally mis-gender myself in my head (every couple of months).
Yeah sometimes I do and then I worry that I’m just faking it even though I know I’m not. Then I end up thinking way to much about it and it just continues like that.
Yes. I have to, im not out to ky classmates or my dad and my native language genders everything. And i mean *everything*.

You wanna say 'I was'??? Ahahaha, what gender are you? What pronouns do you use?? Do you want to be stared at by strangers passing by, while talking comfortably about yourself??? 

Anyways, i hate it very much
I’m still “daddy” to my toddler.  Both my wife and I tend to get my pronouns wrong if I’ve just been referred to as daddy.
I deadnamed myself last week doing my Japanese homework. I’m non-binary, so there are some things I view myself in a masculine light with, so it’s a misgender only if ascribe the wrong gender aspect to an aspect of my identity.
yeah i do, im not out to my family yet so i have to... and i scream internally every. fucking. time.
Yes. Family doesn't help. They misgender me and deadname 100% of time
I constantly miss gender myself in my head
*screams in genderfluid confusion*
I still do it occasionally and even dead name myself in my own head. Last year I was writing a script for a show I was working on and both deadnamed and misgendered myself in the script 😂
I do catch myself saying its ya boi, but I have made it such a permanent part of my lexicon that I cant bother getting myself to stop. She/them/ya boi
Yes.
Yes, occasionally
Not out yet, plus still questioning a bit, plus just new to it, so yeah.
no, since i came out i never even remotely misgendered myself
No, not for like 2 months.
Yeah, alot :(
It happens.
Depends on how many people have misgendered me on a given day. If every single person all day has only used “sir” it’s hard sometimes not to. When I’m with my friends and they all use the right pronouns (outside of occasional slip up which is whatever) it’s easy to not do.
Nah. I find it weird when I talk about some stuff though. I used to fight muay thai and fought waaay pre-transition, so I fought women in the female categories. When I bring this up and say ""blah blah my opponent, she..."", it automatically makes me a ""she"" in that scenario. I don't feel bad about it, but it makes me pause for a second! Gets weird if people don't know I'm trans, as I'm starting to pass a lot more (4 months on T).

Edit: I definitely misgendered myself a lot for the first few months after coming out, but that's totally normal
In certain situations yeah, like when I'm discussing periods, gynos, pregnancy, etc it tends to be a very cis-focused conversation and I end up misgendering myself ¯\(°_o)/¯ 
It also happens in conversations in which I (as an afab person) am talking about being with a man/another transmasc person. I default to bf and gf, just because it's the only way I heard relationships like this talked about. 
Also I speak Spanish and that's a whole other conversation since I use gender neutral pronouns! XD
Omg yes I misgender and deadname myself all the time and I hate it every time
No.
Only a little, but usually because gender is a construct.
All the time! When I'm talking with my friends I'll sometimes misgender myself. Sometimes they correct me, though, and it feels really good.   
   I also get super worried that it means I'm not actually trans sometimes, and get really scared other people think I'm doing it for attention. 

Judging by a lot of the other commenters, it seems pretty normal, so that's kinda reassuring c:
I still deadname myself while brushing my teeth. I was taught as a kid if you sing happy birthday to yourself X number of times, that should be enough brushing for that session.
Way to often my ex-best friend tried to tell everyone I was lying about being trans because I kept calling my self him when I first came out to them
I did at the beginning moreso but sometimes. I am still largely in the closet so it can get a little weird with people calling me {DEADNAME} while not really being shitty about it. 

I would not use this as the indication that you are not trans, if you are wondering that.
Just rarely... due to that I was used to call on discord with classmates as old self...
yeah, occasionally. ive been out for 6 years now, and even tend to retroactively correctly gender myself, but still mess up sometimes.
I do all the time. I still live with an unaccepting dad so I have to keep it mostly to myself. I'd prefer being referred to as feminine pronouns out of ignorance rather than it being done out of spite. I can straight up imagine how hard he'd go out of his way to deadname me or emphasize using she. He already does that with a friend of my sibling.
In my mind, but I've been working really hard not to! Now it rarely happens.
i am glad to see that i am not the only one, i thought that i am faking it but now i see that all of us are faking it or i am still valid
Well I’m not exactly out so yeah, al the time! It gets fucking confusing to switch between the two
Every once in a while I'll have a slight slip but I don't often refer to myself by gender haha.
Mostly when talking about the past. Memories are hard to adjust I guess...
Sometimes un my mind
I did until around a year of being out full time
Yes it’s the worst
I did for a while after starting, and sometimes even in my head I do but it's just muscle memory ❤️
Not publicly out so... yes
Definitely, human. It was a journey using the right pronouns for myself, at first. Got better. Now I have to figure out which pronoun sounds right for that day. Neutral? Masculine? Neo? Every now and then, feminine feels okay -

And sometimes there's no feeling at all. Just existing. Or I'll find that I've been feeling off all day because I used the wrong ones. Pretty consistent with neutral and masculine, at least, though. Just a trip figuring out which one.
Yes
Yeah. I'm only out to my close friends atm, so I'm used to being referred to as a guy and having to pose as a guy
I've never cared about my pronouns. Now that I'm 3 months into my HRT, I still don't. But I always respect people who do and use their preferred ones
Sometimes, yeah. Doesn’t help that I generally don’t pass very well either
Yeah mostly because my parents haven't fully accepted it and a lot of people still refer to me using my deadname and she/her pronouns
It's pretty rare with where I'm at. At the point where I usually don't even remember my deadname and when I do the name doesn't sound like my name anymore.
Yup definitely. Especially when I am with my family who still now me as a guy.
Yes. A lot. Especially in my head but also in public because I’m only out to a few people
Idk what my gender even is. I can't tell what's me and what's years of gender conditioning from society, if there even is a distinction. I'm comfortable calling myself a woman and looking like a woman, and living like a woman, but ive been a man for so long that its hard to not see myself that way most times. Maybe that will change once im farther along in my transition, or maybe its not as simple as being either man or woman, who is to say? I don't understand a lot of the discourse around gender that we have today, all I know is that I'm gonna try to just keep on doing what I want to do and not let that voice in my head stop me just because I might look silly trying to figure it out.
I sometimes deadname myself but I'm not out to an awful lot of people yet so I think that's why.
Yes
Yeah, but it’s less and less frequent. I think it’s a normal thing if you’ve been using the wrong pronouns for a long time, it’s just a bad habit :)
always.. a part of me believes i have to earn the right to use certain  pronouns. also I am only out of the closest on here.  thankfully being on here has eliminated most of my insecurities
Yes. You don't break over 2 decades of habit over night.
No bit I'll sometimes default to my deadname in my head. Like if I'm looking for my name on a list or something.
I constantly misgender myself in my head and deadname myself as well. It then spirals into doubt about weather or not I'm trans and although the answer always comes to I'm trans the doubt I get constantly makes me think I'm lying to myself and others.
Yes, especially because in my language, feminine forms in 1st person are made by adding a suffix to a male form.
So many girls forget to add the suffixes often.
Yea, its a completely normal thing- i do it less than I used to
Hells yes. I'm so used to people calling me a guy that I do it when thinking about myself in my inner momologues and thoughts.

At the same time, I also fantasize about wearing a dress and people calling me ""she"" and having a bigger chest.
Sometimes yes. Conversely, sometimes I briefly forget that I'm even trans at all. I can be very absent minded.
Oh yeah, I am still closeted at work so I still introduce myself by my zombie name and suchlike. On weekends I sometimes have a hard time switching tracks and when a third person situation comes up will fuck up.

Of course I got injured at work and have been home for a month and let all the folks handling my case know my situation so I have started tripping up in the other direction when dealing with anything where I used my zombie name cuz it's the one on my license.
Yeah, if I'm speaking in the third person. Sometimes.
But not as much anymore.

I've finally been me long enough to be comfortable with the new prouns.
Yes.  It's a reason I'm tolerant and understanding with the difficulties others have.
ive gotten into the habit of using gender neuteral terms for myself around people im not out to yet, so not really
i was a guy for 20 years it’s not somethin everyone can turn off over night
I am still trying to remember that my deadname need not be used by me
Not when I am talking about myself, no. But when I think in my head where someone else is talking about me, they are always misgendering me in my head lol. I can't get a break. But I guess it is because it is really hard to get people to gender me correctly irl.
Yes, and sometimes when someone first glance thinks I’m a girl I go “I bamboozled them!”

And then I remember I am a girl and it wasn’t a trick, I literally just am a girl.

And then I doubt myself, and then I take my meds and feel good again
I don't really ever misgender myself, but I deadname myself all the time.
Sometimes I do
yes! im agender but i usually group myself with girls. like if the gym teacher said split into boys and girls, i would just go to the girls side.
i do and then get questions like “this must mean im secretly cus and just faking for attention,right?”  and more.. but yeah i need to misgender myself in my family when im out only to my brother.. and in languages like Russian like every word depends on gender which makes it a little bit hard to think “okay, im with family use she” or “okay, im outside its safe to use he” :)
yep, mostly after spending some times w/ cis ppl ore some I'm not quite out to....
I do it frequently on purpose because of some personal limitations. At my house I have to do that because of the majority if my family, I do boy scouts as a hobby (since like 2015) and I only became trans this year so it's kinda a uh oh on that, and some others but those are the 2 most common areas I do it.
Happened for the first month and once in a blue moon now 7 or 8 months on hrt.

The more fem my appearance becomes the more it’s turned into something that I laugh at rather than causing existential despair because it’s obvious that just doesn’t reflect reality regardless of whether I pass as cis or not.

Even if you don’t look cis when you look in the mirror, after enough time on hrt there’s no way in hell you can look in the mirror and say “that looks like a man”; trans woman? Sure. Man? Uhhh, don’t think so babe 😂
I do it from time to time, but I'm not fully out yet, since everything is expensive these days :')
Been out for a year now. I’ve done it a few times. And it’s so embarrassing because I’m just sitting there thinking “how is anyone supposed to take me seriously if I just misgendered myself”. Le sigh.
Im 9 years in and I still have a slip up at least once a week in my head. Sometimes it makes me have a little break down about if im actually trans
I only do when I’m making up conversations with people and the ‘other’ person uses the dead pronoun. Idk. I talk to myself a lot
Sometimes. I thought I liked they/them for the longest time, so whenever I'm narrating something to myself or thinking about what other people are thinking of me, I accidentally use those for myself.
Yeah, when I get misgendered alot irl it kinda sinks into my mind.
Yes, someone asked for (given name) on phone , and I said ""this is sheeee...he"" 🤦
I can't remember the last time I did that... but I'm sure it's happened.
Sometimes i call myself gay in reference to women, forgetting that although i’m nonbinary, im def more a guy, making my attraction to men what makes me gay
Yeah, I’m not out at my dojo and I’ve had to misgender myself several times
YES, I'm so bad about that, and I hate myself a little for it
I have never had any issues but sometimes get confused in certain situations. Like if someone says ""Hey miss"" across a room while looking at me and I am not always sure if they are talking to me. Not because I feel like I look masculine because I don't think I do at all. But, I don't know sometimes how I look to ""others"" compared to how I look to myself.
When I think of other people thinking of me, I always Invision them calling me he, even tho I hate being called he
I feel like this is hilariously relevant (we still laugh about it)  my daughter met her bf's father for the first time and introduced herself by her dead name. Awesomely awkward
Luckily, my OCD has manifested gender neutral words in my everyday speech. That being said, I still don't view modified words as ""Real"".

Words like"" S.he, FE.male, WO.man, A.man.DA, etc...

Those that suggest there's a *modified* man and not a real man.

Look at HU.man for example, why are WO.men not considered a synonym? They're explicity considered different in our lexicon.
I was genderqueer and used they/them before I came out. I wore simple skirts all the time that looked a bit like kilts. So I got used to a feminine presentation years before I realized I was an egg. Been 3yrs 8mos as a woman, after about three months it really clicked for me when I looked in the mirror a bit ragged looking and said to myself ""Jesus Aliyah, you look like a tomboy right now"" without thinking about it. I fucking cried I surprised myself and felt the active shift in how I thought of myself. I've never looked back.
I used to, I’ve been out for many years but didn’t physical transition until this year. Now it’s hard to misgender myself in front of people I’m not out to. It can be problematic, I’ve almost outed myself several times, but it’s validating to know that I subconsciously see myself as a man through and through. I used to really beat myself up over accidentally misgendering myself.
Oh all the time, I am pre everything so I look really masculine and when I know that i just go with he/him all the time however one thing I never get wrong is my name funnily enough (I have this thing where depending on the context I’m going by different things (ish) like in private or if I’m with people I’ve come out to I go by Emily and she/her, but when I’m in public me and the other people I’ve come to use the androgynous version of my old name and I use they/them, and for some reason I always get my pronouns wrong, but never my name, which I think is strange because with that name being so close to my old one, I thought I’d get that wrong more often, but so far I’ve been correct without fail)
i do the opposite. sometimes ill write ""Mia"" on my paper at school on accident and have to erase it lmao
Yes, all the time
yup, especially when talking about my childhood or when speaking from someone else’s point of view
Yes, all the time. In fact, I rarely gender myself correctly. Probably will continue to until I fully transition.
I do, and it makes me worry that I'm just faking it all.
I notice most times when I'm at my weakest I tend to accidentally think of myself as a female, even if I look like a male and know I'm definitely a male and I'm happy that way, I always seem to feel like *my dead name* when I'm not doing okay.
My wife started her transition more than a decade ago, and she still slips up on occasion.
I only do it because very few people actually gender me correctly so I sometimes get caught up in what they're saying.
I just did the other day. Shit happens.
yeah i use she/her pronouns referring to myself in my head, even though i dislike those pronouns lol
Yes, but deliberately as I'm still in the closet.
No. I always refer to myself as she. Now for others that’s a different story. Mis gendered and dead named. ☹️
Yeah. I don't view myself as a woman anymore but I still sometimes use the wrong pronouns for myself. I use they/them and have caught myself using she/her for myself many times.
I misgender myself regularly, and every time it spirals into full blown imposter syndrome. Fun times.
I sometimes deadname and use the wrong pronouns for myself when introducing myself to people my older sister is friends with, I dont like doing it yet it feels like a habit for me
Yes, I had to make a whole bunch of phone calls for work over three days. Managed to deadname myself once every day.
When im not out to someone yes
As a he/they nb, kinda. I sometimes have a thought where I 'guy' myself which I'm not entirely opposed to but it  always makes me pause when it happens.
I do all the freaking time, and good lord is it one of my biggest discomforts right now. Hormones have been working well for me in many ways over the last 6 months, but I still dead name and misgender myself in my head way too often. It's not even overtly. I typically have two levels of inner thought. One where I'm functionally speaking to myself in my head and is more controlled and another that's more implicit, quiet and less controlled. The implicit one is the one that constantly dead names me and misgenders me. It's so frustrating, because I know it's that level of thought that's the hardest to change. Meaning I'm probably going to be stuck doing it for quite a while. I just want to be Ellie to myself already, and stop feeling like I'm just faking all this.
no... but i used to wonder who saw through my disguise before i came out, and i used to say a lot of egg type things without realizing i was validating my true self as my shell was cracking
Yeah. Doesn’t help that my family still calls me by my deadname (I’m not out to them) and I have to refer to myself as masculine so that bleeds over into conversation with friends and even me on my own.
yeah my dad misgenders me so often I start to do it to myself
oh all the time
Yeah. Sometimes in my brain I call myself he or my deadname, but it's happening less and less. 20 years of habit is tough to break lol
Constantly. Living as a guy for 40 years will do that to you. It still feels weird referring to myself as female, and being called “she” or “ma’am.” It feels way better than “sir,” though. Gods, I hate that one…

EDIT: It doesn’t help that I’m still Dad to my daughter, and Daddy to our cats. I do want it that way, though. I see those as names, not titles.
This probably sounds fake, it's not. I'm just a dumbass I swear. Been out since April. Was so tired Monday morning I wrote my deadname on a piece of paper. Thankfully I noticed the accident and corrected it.
Well, I did, until I just got plain used to it, I might do it her and there without knowing so, but I don't really do it much. Also, I hate it when people repeatedly say 'It's going to take some time for us to say your pronouns and get used to it' Well, It's the same for me, I have to get used to it myself, sure it may be easier for me, but I still need to get used to it myself.
I tend to mentally group myself in either gender group depending on the context, but I’m also nonbinary enough of a trans guy to not care too much. -Jackson
Yeah, quite a bit. Unfortunately, I don't really pass at all, and doubt I ever will. I look in the mirror and just wonder if I'm doing the right thing a lot.
Yeah quite a lot, but maybe just because I get misgendered in public a lot. I’ve noticed after three years out to friends & two to family I still react more instinctively to my deadname, which is so weird! A girl in my seminar group has my deadname, and I keep looking up when it’s her turn during roll call. Pretty sure the instructor has noticed by now but he didn’t say anything 😅
Been out since 2014, on testosterone since 2018, and still at least once a day I do it. Usually not out loud but still
Sometimes

When someone refers as me as female I just say my name

But when they are a bit old and use masculine pronouns I just use my deadname
i don’t really anymore, at 1 year out and on HRT, although sometimes my brain is caught off guard by people gendering me correctly. like my mom will say she and internally im like “oh right, i AM she :)”
Yes regularly. It's totally ok, I've been out for a few years now and I still do it. ಠ◡ಠ It's ok, you're so valid. Have a good day
I have to. My family is homophobic, my school is pretty homophobic (despite there being a GSA- Gay Straight Allience) and the town I live in.

A couple years back, the pride flag in my town was burned three times due to multiple churches saying it went against God's word and I think this year was the year we got one back up... maybe, I'm unsure
I almost vomit even trying to lol
I still accidentally respond to my dead name a little too often.. 💀
Oh, absolutely. At this point i misgender myself more than others do.
I kinda did at the start, it’s worn off now though. However, one of my current favourite songs is I/Me/Myself by Will Wood and the main line of the song is ‘I wish I could be a girl!’ (It’s been popular on TikTok recently, that’s the line in the audio) and it feels a little weird. Not enough to make me not listen to the song, but in hindsight it is kinda weird for me as a transmasc to enjoy it so much! It’s a brilliant song though, highly recommend it
I do it all the time :( sometimes it makes me question myself but I know that it’s just a really bad habit of mine, but I also wouldn’t be so bothered if I wasn’t trans so it’s bitter sweet.
Once in a while yes. But I’m trying to remind myself that I am not who I was anymore.
I do at times. It’s mostly because I don’t use my own names or pronouns very often in reference to myself but I’ve gotten much better over time
Where I'm not complete out so I kinda have too
Less and less, but it still happens a little under a year after coming out. Finally started adressing myself as a woman while dreaming recently
Yeah, it sucks
I’m nonbinary so it’s hard to misgender myself but yes I do
Yes, but not as often as when I first came out.
Sometimes, but not often (socially transitioned teen)
I've been out for over a year, on HRT for 3 months, and I still misgender myself in like, idioms and turns of phrase, and feel really weird about it.
all the time bc im not out yet
Quite often
Yes and it’s really embarrassing, was telling a story about myself at work and accidentally called myself a he, corrected myself and carried in but my word was it embarrassing 😳 xx
Yup. Especially, when I am tired or distracted.
I don't really misgender myself, I mean, I'm not publicly out yet... Tho since I live in Spain, we have gendered words and when talking about myself with my psychologist I often use the male terminations, just because I'm not used to using the female ones
No, can’t recall ever doing that, but wouldn’t invalidate anyone else who does. To be fair, it’s very rare that I would be gendering myself in any case, as I don’t have an inner monologue unless I consciously choose to have one. I think one reason (from a trans woman perspective) could potentially be a lot of society defaulting things to male pronouns in a lot of phrases “I’m your man for the job”, “last man standing” etc. “Woman” can be put into these phrases but it doesn’t roll off the tongue quite as easily.
Occasionally yes, I'm not out yet and whenever someone says my deadname I give myself an instant mental note that what they said is wrong. Same thing in my own head too. Now I mostly use my new name in my head.
Not a trans myself but- none of my trans friends are fully open so they constantly missgender themselves infront of others because they are scared of someone telling their parents
I do this sometimes and it sucks if I’m talking with someone who thinks I’m confused or that me being trans is a phase
Always
I just did yesterday actually, for the first time in quite a while. My daughter corrected me 😂
I kinda have to. Can’t let my parents figure me out.
I'm still fully pre everything. My voice and body are still so masc that it can be very disorienting. It doesn't happen often **out loud**, but in my head I misgender myself far more often than I wish I did.
I did accidentally today
I sometimes still do, but its not weird to misgender urself when uve spend 18 years of ur life pretending to be another gender. It takes time to unwind al that stuff
I’m not out but I try to use gender neutral language when referring myself in front of friends and family in an attempt to not misgender myself. 

The other day I walked into a room my friends were in and said “it’s ya boi” and then went “uh I mean it’s ya person”. Totally not suspicious or anything.

Last night when playing a video game I was completing a trophy really well and just said “oh I am a good boy” and immediately felt like shit realising what I said.

It happens I guess :/
i used to identify as nonbinary between identifying as male and female (i'm mtf). i remember for a while after coming out as a trans girl, in my thoughts and when referring to myself in third person, i usually would've said they.
I'm pre everything and live with my parents who doesn't support me, so I have to misgender myself sometimes.

I asked my friend to start using she/her when addressing to me last week, and we all sometimes misgender me (I do it the most tbh)

It's annoying, but it's just a matter of getting used to it, just like everything else
I found when I was talking about myself in 3rd person in a sense I would, a he there instead of a she for example, it definitely sucked but I stopped after doing afew times
very much so, but I’m not out to anyone except one of my friends and two guys who overheard me, so really, it’s more for my own safety. really, I’m completely fine with being viewed as being a girl, I just hate actually being a girl.
Guilty 😳
In my head, all the time. Not out yet so I guess it's alright but I'm trying to fix it
I find myself even a couple years out I sometimes think of myself in masculine
This is a great comment because it shows how hard it is. Even when you're talking about misgendering yourself and trying to be conscious about it - you still misgender yourself. Same girl same
HRT is MAGIC.  Wearing a bra is the only thing that keeps me from groping my chest constantly out of pure elation over having something to fondle xD

Still cis tho
Lol I can totally relate to this, except I’ve had breast augmentation and vaginoplasty as well…
Ugh yes! Every night when I get home from work, I check myself out before I jump in the shower. I just look and think ""damn, those boobs are getting nice."" Even better, they're mine. 😁😅
I'm not on HRT, but I've got the same problem and I hate it :/
I feel the same sometimes (but opposite, because I’m transmasc), btw happy cake day sister!
Thank you for being me and saying this
lmao i'm just imagining some cute girl walking by, tripping and dropping her starbucks, somehow landing and catching her drink mid air, standing up then yelling ""I AM ALL THAT IS MAN"". I love it :'D
[deleted]
Next time you do, tell yourself it’s totally normal. You went by your dead name and pronouns for all those years, of course it had an impact on you. Slipping up is just that, an accident. It doesn’t define you.
Same, fucking polish
You made me laugh waayyy too hard girl! I've only got 5 month tiny titties and I still play with the damn things all the time!
I haven't started HRT but I get super excited when thinking about starting the process and getting my own LOL

My family is going through some struggles and its not ideal for me to start rn since we are in the middle of moving across the country. But I start in 6 months time!
I gripe myself all the time, and so does my wife! Haha! It’s wonderful.
As all cis guys totally want to!  Lol.  Brains amiright?
I am happy to as long as you acknowledge that your brain is lying to you about being cis.
We are the same
Lmaoo

Try to guess mine lol
Lol I share that timeline almost exactly, and same!
I literally thought this. If anyone had a choice before they were born to be either male or female, everyone would have picked female. It just made so much sense to me. And I thought that was how it was. Girls are just better, why would anyone want to be a hairy brutish man? Lol how young and naive I was...
Yeah I know that I'm well into transitioning. And yet...
I'm guessing French or maybe Spanish
I find the farther I go the more that part of my brain screams to go back.  Sometimes it's the loudest voice, but usually the rest of my brain tells it to go sit in the corner.
Nope

Try again
Tbh I still get that voice but I've mostly got board of it. Whenever it crops up another part of my brain goes ""yeah yeah we've been through this before it's a catastrophe whatever""
Wait no, czech
Turkish?
Oh that made me laugh.  Someday soon hopefully my brain will have achieved total complacency to this catastrophe.
Ding ding ding!
You've just got to realise you've had the exact same conversation with yourself a hundred times. I realised I kept going over the same ground again and again and again. And yet I kept going with transitioning every time, kept coming to the same conclusion that I was trans. Once I realised this I realised it was just catastrophising, and the only way to win is to not play the game."	ql44ue	trans	1048	1.0	2021-11-02 13:24:28
Finally went to therapy (didn’t go well)	"My parents finally listened to me and found a therapist for me to see. My dysphoria lately has been at an all time low and I’ve really lost all hope 

I wanted help, I wanted to get better and the first session went okay. She misgendered me more then once, even though I stated my pronouns, and asked weird questions about my sexuality. Felt very confused after that session. 

Second session was even worse. The therapist misgendered me twice in the first 10 minutes which fucking sucked because I don’t get misgendered often anymore. She kept bringing the conversation back to sex which made me uncomfortable considering I never brought up sex and don’t particularly have any problems with it considering I’m not having it. Then the worst part, she  went through my body, head to toe, asking whether I liked each part. She stopped specifically on my chest, asking me to describe my chest and using words that made me feel so dysphoric. Thankfully the session ended when we got to my hips so I didn’t have to say anything else. 

I’ve decided I’m not going back. I feel violated. The thought of going to another therapist and having the same thing happen is terrifying but I want help so badly. I really don’t know what to do. Just needed to vent

Edit: I posted this and then fell asleep. I am so overwhelmed with all the comments. I thought I was overreacting. Thank you"	"Here's what I did. Go to Psychology Today, filtering exclusively for transgender-related issues. They have people who have studied on these topics that can help you through your journey. Make sure they accept whatever insurance you're under. I don't regret it one bit.

Might be hard to find the filter, so just google ""transgender therapy >your location< psychology today"" and you should get a result. And no, I'm not some promoter if anyone's curious.
That really sucks, I'm so sorry you had to go through that. 

I know it's probably a sticky situation, since you live with your parents, but do you have the ability to choose a new therapist yourself? Do your parents have any control over that?

Like, could you find one that is affirming? Cause you could definitely use one
I want to echo that this is super not normal and you’re right to feel violated. Even therapists that aren’t trained specifically on trans issues are supposed to approach sessions from a place of radical acceptance. It’s super not okay for them to misgender you.

My therapist isn’t super familiar with trans issues but she has never misgendered me and has had absolutely no issues using my preferred name and pronouns. If we talk about my discomfort with my body I am in control of what parts we talk about and the goal of the conversation is always centered around accepting what I can’t change and working on what I can to get where I want to be. Same goes for sex. I want to emphasize that this kind of therapist is normal and obtainable. You should expect to feel safe in your session and feel like your therapist is there to support you in your goals.
That is definitely not ok I’m sorry u had to experience this.
The problem is they found one for you they should have let you find one
This is abuse. If you're a minor it's child abuse.

What the fuck
>I’ve decided I’m not going back. I feel violated.

That's because you were violated. Fucking scum ass therapist. I'm in college to be a psychologist, and I'm always fucking appalled by how terrible some people are at their jobs. Where I live, you go to school for over 10 years once you finish high-school to get the qualifications, take on obscene amounts of debt in order to finish your education, all so you can be a therapist...

***and some fucking morons still come out being fucking morons?***

Boggles my fucking mind.

>The thought of going to another therapist and having the same thing happen is terrifying but I want help so badly.

With all that said, not all therapists are garbage. Hell, a lot of them are what I aspire to be once I'm trained. 

If you want my advice, seek a therapist that is unaffiliated with your prior, violating therapist. That means avoid the ""agency"" they work at and avoiding any ""recommendations"" they might have. Try to have some input on your therapist selection, and perhaps tell your parents why you're done with this one (because they violated you). If they push back, ask if they'd like to stay in a room with an older person constantly talking about sex and their body as a minor.

I'm sorry your therapist was utter crap, but there are many good ones. Not all therapists are for everyone (although this one seems to be for no one), so often people experiment before finding a therapist they're willing to stick with. 

Good luck partner, and remember, you're pretty cool
Holy shit, your therapist might be a fucking pedo. Please search on psychologytoday.com for an lgbt affirming and allied therapist.
Never see that therapist again and look into reporting them for this sexual harassment.
That’s known as sexual harassment. You really need to tell someone what happened. Maybe your parents, maybe someone else, but someone. Ideally someone who can report this because that kind of behavior is grounds for losing a medical license and then some
Honey, you just got a garbage therapist. There are loads of wonderful ones out there. Give up on this stupid woman, but do give it a try with someone else. I've only been doing therapy for a few months but it has helped me figure out a bunch of stuff. Good luck! (and <hugs>)
Report, report, report!!!! Go to the most senior person in the building and report them! If thats not possible, then try and find a website that their name is on and write a scathing review, if you can handle that.
this isn't therapy, it's abuse. Don't go anymore.
That's absolutely fucking awful and I'm so sorry you experienced that. Idk anything about this but maybe look into reporting them? 

If possible try to find a therapist that's LGBTQ+ (or experienced with patients who are) I finally found a therapist who's enby and it's so so much better than constantly worrying about how they'll react and having to try to explain things to people who will just never get it
My therapist never did that with me. She made the goals very clear: figure out what gender is to me and how to handle the dysphoria. She pressed the fact that it was alright for me not to know for certain and that I controlled the pace of the sessions.   


what I mean is that maybe this therapist isn’t the right fit for you and it would be a good idea for you to try a different one. If you don’t feel comfortable with doing that right away, that’s alright.
Sometimes I think people just need to be beat up... your therapist is one... a bully.  That's so awful.  Glad you're not going back.
Omg so wrong!  Such bad bad therapy!  Not your fault don’t go back!  I would def def feel icky about that too!
What a fucking creep 🤢 I’m so sorry that happened, OP. I hope you’re able to find a better therapist. I went through a few therapists before finding one that was actually supportive and helpful
Report that therapist for sexual harassment stating that throughout multiple sessions they used therapy time to make disgusting remarks about your body which were not related to the topics at hand.
look for a gender phsyciatrist, not just a general therapist
Wow. Another person who fetishises trans people. Jesus christ, I hate people
This therapist sounds abusive
Is there a person who runs the clinic that you go to? Talk to the secretary and be polite. Ask for contact information about your ""current"" therapist and simply state a few things to the head of the clinic. If the person doesn't do a thing, report this to American council associations. They have to follow guidelines to allow you feel safe. 

[ACA](https://www.counseling.org/about-us/divisions-regions-and-branches)

This will guide you who to go to. They are discriminating you by not call you by your respectable pronouns and making you feel violated mentally. This is the problem that we need to make sure we stand up for ourselves. Be strong. If you need help, I'm here as a researcher.
I'm soo sorry about what you had to go through, your old therapist was awful
As someone who has had a lot of therapy in the past i am so sorry about your experience :(

I swear therapists aren't all like this, the two i've met were really respectful of me. The first thing a therapist is supposed to do is instill trust with the patient and they definitely did not do that in your case. 

If you do decide to go back to see a therapists and they make you feel uncomfortable it's really important that tou tell them and it's absolutely ok to do so! Talking about why it makes you uncomfortable might be more important than talking about the subject itself. 

Also, being honest is an important part of the therapeutic process. If they hurt you by missgendering you, you have to tell them.
Are your parents supportive? This reeks of selecting the worst therapist on purpose
Horrible therapist. You deserve someone better
*Gross.* I'd report her if I were you, and if you can build up the courage to do so, though you shouldn't have to... ***please*** do, so she doesn't do this to anyone else. That was a transphobe and... possibly something worse, who you met; your parents made a pretty fucking terrible decision and she had no right to make the conversation about sex or about your body like that. How unprofessional and horrific. 

Considering I'm in the medical field and probably older than you, I wish I could've met her and had a session with her to tell her off and report her myself. Disgusting. Hell, I'd help you, if I had information enough to do so. :\\ 

That was absolutely violating behavior for a therapist and she **needs** to have her license pulled. What a total creep. 

I hope you take the advice I saw elsewhere here and search up a therapist who specializes in support of LGBT+ people, including ***transition support***\--but it sounds like she was trying to ease you into conversion therapy (also known as psychological torture) instead.

I found mine on psychology today like the first comment, I've never been misgendered by my therapists and they've always been respectful and kind, never diving into any topics I was not willing and ready to discuss myself.
OP If you are under 18 that therapist needs to be reported. That's straight up creepy as fuck either way and you definitely should not see  her again. Deeply unprofessional and inappropriate.
Don't get discouraged. You got a bad one out of the way. Now there's one less for you to have problems with, which means the right one is out there!
Are your parents supportive or not? Because it kinda sounds like they looked for and then ""found"" a therapist who's supposed to talk you out of being trans or at least turn you away from therapy.
Ew, that's gross! I'm so sorry that happened to you! Not all therapists are like that nasty person, I promise. I've had 4 different therapists over the years, and mine have all been wonderful. If you can, try to find a different one like other people have suggested. Good luck!
What you described didn’t sound like a therapist. That sounded so unprofessional. I don’t know maybe finding one with good credentials or good reviews on gender dysphoria. I’m sorry this has happened to you. Good luck I hope you find what you’re looking for quickly.💕
Idk where your parents found this therapist but this is garbage. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. This is NOT an appropriate behavior. This is sexual harassment. I don’t know the whole story, but it seems that your parents are not supportive/are pretty ignorant on the topic. And if they were the one to pick this person… 

What you described is a red flag after red flag. I’ve got some TERFy vibes from that person. There is an issue of hate groups/non-affirming churches/other organizations offering “therapy” which is not provided by properly trained and licensed individuals. If you can, report this person. Talk to someone you trust about it. Reach out to a hotline. And definitely don’t go back.

Therapy, when done properly, is amazing. I second suggestions by other folks here to use psychology today to seek a therapist. You can even look for a therapist who is trans themself. Look for people who adhere to WPATH standards of care
Yoooo this is uh…

you need to put this in a review on one of their pages and cut ties that shit is not okay
Been through a v similar experience i feel you bruh and im so sorry, you're definitely NOT overreacting.
She is a shitty therapist but that doesn't mean that all therapist are bad, it took me a while to move on from what happened with my first therapist but trust me not all therapists are bad not all therapists are gonna misgender you or violate you. You can get better but ofc with another therapist one that'd actually respect you.
May I ask what your pronouns are?
I’ve ever had a bunch of the comments and haven’t seen anyone mention this yet so I guess I will…

I’m guessing that all the creepy, weird sexual stuff is probably because this person is completely uneducated, or has really screwy transphobic ideas about sex or sexual orientation being related to your neurological gender, when it’s not. 

If YOU wanted to talk about that or YOU wanted to talk about your body, that would be fine, but this is super creepy and not something they should be doing. Nor of course should I be miss gendering you
Hi, I'm Irish too. would you be able to say who the therapist was? in a DM maybe. I can also recommend some better ones depending on where you live!
I’m sorry you went through this. You are never overreacting. When you feel uncomfortable, you feel uncomfortable. 
Therapists are just people. If a person doesn’t treat you right, then you distance yourself from them. That therapist should be reported to her supervisor. That’s just inappropriate in so many levels!!
My psychologist misgenders me aswell. She'll be speaking about a group of unknown people of different genders and use the neutral plural, if she says the masc plural (wich is the one we are used to, and even i use it) she will correct herself to the neutral one, but then she will speak about me using fem pronouns and won't correct herself or apologize 😐

But your situation sounds awful, specially the part about describing your chest- if it was me i would find some way to inform someone (her superior, write a review) or something because that's kind of creepy honestly
This person who took your money definitely does not sound like a professional to me! More like a hack who doesn’t actually want to help with anyone’s problems.

Definitely find someone else who actually cares about their patients, and tell that person to just jump off a cliff or something!

I had a therapist that had no idea about transgender issues, but he definitely helped me with other issues. And when he couldn’t help me, he suggested a colleague who could help. That is what a good therapist should do, help you to find the resources!
Therapists are every bit as human as the rest of us and *some just are not very sensitive to their patients'  needs and where they are ""at; ""  what they can handle at any  given point in time.*  I'm really sorry you had to go through all that ;  it was obviously extremely uncomfortable for you, on so many levels.  **Besides all the agonizing focus on your body, there were also the micro-aggressions involving the fact of her refusal to honour your repeated requests for the proper pronouns.**

Meanwhile, the fact is that now you are still left feeling the need for help. ***Despite everything that happened, don't give up.  The worst thing to do is to assume ""well, these therapists -- they're all the same,"" because they are not.  There is someone  ( and more than one )  out there who is a  good fit and will treat you with the respect you deserve while helping you!***

*Ask around and  get suggestions, if at all possible, about therapists from people who have gone to therapy.  Tell your parents to phone around to therapist's offices and specifically ask if the doctor / therapist in question has specific training in dealing with transgender clients and their         ( very real )  issues.*

*Find out from other clients, too, what their therapists' ""bedside manners""  have been like*  ( that is, how they approach patients, and what their manners and attitudes have proven to         be ).  **You deserve so much more than blatant harassment, prejudice, and ignorance.**  Going through what you endured is worse, in its way, than never seeing a psychotherapist at all.

Good luck, much love, best wishes and blessings to you, from Richanne Laura Sylvia.
I do feel you were send for conversion therapy… check the background of the so called therapist.
Report this to the board.
That's a horrible therapist. Please don't give up on therapy in general, there will be ones out there that respect you, your identity, your pronouns, and your comfort.
To add to this, when you look at a profile you can see Communities on the side (or bottom on mobile). Transgender Allied is a community they can say they are a part of.
Yep, this is what I did. It was surprisingly easy to find a good therapist this way
One morning, definitely check their profiles to make sure there aren't any religious references. I ended up getting a therapist for a family issue with all adults who was a former conversion therapy therapist for religious organization. So just keep an eye out. That aside I have had all my other therapists and psychiatrists this way and they all rocked.
Thank you for the advice, I’ll try that
That’s how i got mine
This is how I got mine, she's been absolutely wonderful.
thank you for this!! I've been trying to find a therapist that isn't [some flavour of bad/bigoted] in Indiana, and it's been awful but now it's actually looking positive!
the people on psychology today are reputable? I'm kinda skeptical on the thought but I don't have many options in my area
Yeah i had a trans specific therapist for awhile she was pretty good although i couldnt continue attending
I found mine listed in WPATH. She has been awesome.
They picked this one but if I asked I think they’d let me pick a new one myself
Also sexual harassment. Ask minor to describe their chest? That sound like creep.
Thank you I really appreciate it
This
Thank you, I’m glad you found a good one
I live in Ireland and I don’t think we have anything like that here. Thank you though
They’re trying like they’ve never stopped me presenting male. I hope it wasn’t on purpose, I think it was a genuine mistake
They are supportive or at least they try to be. Therapist was apparently recommended by a friend and was able to see me within the week. I think it was a genuine mistake because I couldn’t find anything bad about her online
He/him
I live in Dublin, if you had any recommendations that would be great. If you don’t know of anyone that’s okay I’m sure I could find something :)
I’m sorry your psychologist misgenders you that’s really shit
I did that and I got someone who wasn't transphobic but was really not well educated or ready to help with trans issues. She just seemed to tick those boxes to try to get more patients. I had my endo recommend some people and they were amazing therapists 

You gotta try therapists one after another until you find one you click with. Finding a good one first try is very rare
I don't know how much vetting they do, but I (eventually) found my therapist there and just LOVE her; she's a lifesaver!
Well that seems like a good indicator at least. I hope you can move past this and find a better therapist!
Noice.
city therapy on dame street has therapists that deal with trans stuff, like Michelle Kelly. you can also look at this website https://www.psychologytoday.com/ie/counselling/county-dublin/dublin?category=transgender, can't speak for how good the rest of them are but if they specialise in trans therapy they are very unlikely to misgender you at the least
I’ll definitely look into them thank you so much

Constant deadnaming/misgendering is gonna make me snap	"Every fucking day I get a little closer to just losing it, I've yelled at my mother so many times already that the name she gave me is not my name, and while I respect it it isn't the name I go by. Being called a boy, her son, someone's nephew, even when I'm out to my family is getting me on the edge and I don't know if I can take this shit anymore, my temper has been getting worse and I keep finding myself having to stop and pause before doing something on impulse.

This isn't really intended to try and find a solution I just can't keep this bottled up, sorry if this is flooding the sub.."	"Maybe get a little buzzer thing you can put in your pocket and every time someone says a thing that isn’t your gender just buzz it. It will save you the time and energy of explaining and get them to stop being jackasses. (Hopefully) Make it loud like maybe one from an annoying board game? There’s probably apps on the phone too but you’d have to have the app open and in your hand whenever someone was talking to you. And it might not be loud enough/quick enough. The idea is to interrupt their patterns so they think about what they are saying.
Yeah I get this. No matter how many times that I try to correct them they say I'm shoving my identity down their throats. If they *really* think that me telling them I'm a guy and to use he/him pronouns is me ""sHoVIng mY idENTiTY dOWN thEiR thRoAts"" then I hope they choke on my identity and lose oxygen to what few brain cells they have left.
Rant away!! Say it for all of us that feel it too! (Me) 😭💖
Oh I feel this so hard. Came out like 3 months ago and my dad has never once asked if I want to go by a different name, keeps calling me words like dude, man, son, chap etc... I hate it so fucking much. He says he will do anything to support me but I guess that has just never crossed his mind. I made it very clear how it makes me feel worthless and very depressed when being seen and addressed as a man, but it's still deadname he/him. Every time I'm misgendered I die inside a little, I need to control myself aswell not to completely freak out, I understand how you feel 😕 if u wanna talk about it feel free to message me sis!💞💞💞
I kept getting misgendered in one thread (not on Reddit), I called someone out on it, then they signaled supposed hypocrisy because I “wanted them to assume my gender, but got mad when they did”, even though they did so incorrectly and in light of the fact I was clearly a girl.
Yep. Me too.
My mom does the exact same thing. There have been times I’m too scared to stand up but also felt like I was about to snap. 

It’s hard bottling up all these emotions and feelings. Please know that we all support you and have your back. You can always vent and rant about what your going through.
The plain and simple is, your mother is doing it as a defense mechanism to delude herself into thinking her reality is the golden standard. She’s terrified of the march of change, she feels the world is out of her control, however, instead of embracing change, she freezes and refuses to move with her ears plugged like a child. In irony, she fully believes she is protecting you, she is holding onto the remnants of what once was, in order to build her castle of broken dreams and lost hopes to live the romanticized dream she desperately clings to delude herself into believing is reality. What you need to do is explain to your mother that when she deadnames you, you understand that it’s not her that’s saying that. It’s her ego, and you need to shatter that ego. Her ego is protecting her and she knows it hurts you, but can’t control her own ego. 

Catch her off guard, when she least expects it. Her guard is lowest when she feels safe, from what you’ve described, that is when she is deadnaming and misgendering you. She is reminded that the world is out of her control, she believes she’s lost her own children, so the ego does everything to suppress that traumatic experience (yes, I’m making the claim that coming out can be a traumatic experience for the parent as well, we are still all humans, we don’t get to pretend others don’t.) It will use any justification to rationalize that you are still their “little [wrong gender here].” You need to shatter that line of defense, and it requires great determination and courage to do, yet the task is rather simple. You need to catch her slipping up, this is easy to do. 

Talk to her normally, and get her to say something you want. She semi-consciously thought of this statement. Now you need to provoke an emotional reaction. This is the scary part, cause you fear that you might go overkill and hurt them. Don’t worry, that’s the point. If they don’t know how dehumanizing that experience is, they will never change. You need to mock, ridicule and get angry as well. However, don’t lose yourself to your emotions, control yourself and let everything out. Vent, dump all the pain she’s inflicted on you right back. Sounds inhumane, but what I’m teaching you to do is how the military breaks smartass recruits, it’s called a shark attack. You are going to make her go through another traumatic experience, but not all trauma is bad. After you two are done, your mother will have learned a lot. Even if she seems like she’s in disarray and hates you, that’s another defense mechanism, this one is dead easy to beat, show her compassion, tell her you forgive her if she will change, and ask permission to hug her. Show her that you are more mature than her, if she’s religious, the symbolism behind how you are Jesus in this scenario will destroy her and get her to get her head out her ass.

Now that you done “reading” it the first time, go back and read what I said again, we both know you only skimmed it ADHD brain =D


Edit: some valuable quotes.

“If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles. If you know yourself but not the enemy, for every victory gained you will also suffer a defeat. If you know neither the enemy nor yourself, you will succumb in every battle.”

“Let your plans be dark and impenetrable as night, and when you move, fall like a thunderbolt.”
Invest in an air horn. If they step out of line… it will get them to change real quick.
If I ever snap im probably just gonna punch someone very hard then hit myself against a wall equaly as hard
Sometimes it won't change - living with mother I told her like 1.5 year ago now.  
She knows I am on hormones, she sees me change etc.  
but no, she insist on deadnaming me, mispronounce all that stuff.

Our relationship was bad beforehand anyway, so I just try not to talk to her or respond unless I really have to, if I hear hear say deadname - end of conversation. 

 Not saying that will fix your problem, it might it might not - but will be less emotional abuse for you if you do it this way,  


And in bigger picture, get away from them if they continue their ways, not healthy to live around people who simply don't respect you.
I feel the same, I can't take it anymore
I feel that. I actually got my name and gender marker change specifically because of that. Fortunately it gets better.
i recommend going to therapy, they'll give you tips on how to improve your situation
Sometimes you have to just move away. It can be too hard for the people who cared about pre-transition you to ever make the leap to loving and respecting who you really are now.
You're fine I kinda feel the same way. My situation doesn't sound as bad as yours is but my sympathy is with you. Now go be the best girl you can be babe.            ❤️🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️❤️🏳️‍⚧️
Idk how viable it is in your situation but ive been trying a squirt bottle, didn't work at first but i started using soda after a while and i guess its annoying enough to get my family to stop.
Ohh boo-boo keep venting. Let it out. 
Imma grab the popcorn while you do. 
Hugs
Or maybe try using a squirt bottle, like people do with cats to change their behaviour?
Get an air horn and write on it horn of shame and whenever you get misgendered utilize the horn from what I hear it works I’m not out to my family cause I wanna have one more thanksgiving with them and Christmas before I get disowned
Combine the buzzer with a misgendering jar everyone has to put some money in when they get stuff wrong and you get a nice ice cream every now and then
If my mother said I was ""shoving my identity down their throat"" I'd blow up in her face. (or my dad for that matter) 

Really? I AM THE ONE SHOVING LIES DOWN YOUR THROAT? REALLY? ME? Not you and dad and everyone else on the planet who during MY ENTIRE FUCKING LIFE has told me how I must act... OR ELSE? Not you when your depressed, confused 14 year old said they felt lost and NEEDED to figure themselves out (didn't know what, but desperately knew something was seriously wrong) and you EXPLODED AT THEM saying the devil was leading him away from you? Not you when smothering ALL SENSE OF INDIVIDUALITY IN ME except the little individuality you specifically sanctioned???

No?! It couldn't possibly be that I KNOW MYSELF. Nope! You know me better than me myself AND YOU WERE DETERMINED TO ENFORCE THAT!!!

But no of course. IT'S ME who's ""shoving my ideas down YOUR THROAT."" If you aren't allowed to oppress me then that means you are being oppressed??? 

It makes me sick the audacity of people... Especially my parents. I feel for ya'll still stuck living with people like that...

Edit: sorry. I have A LOT of pent up emotion over this.
My step-dad knows my name and pronouns and yet hasn't used them once. It's been like 6 months since I told him. I'm over it. He is the only one who doesn't even make an effort. He says he ""supports"" me no matter what, but won't take this simple step. My mum just says that I ""need to understand he is supportive in other ways...""

I move country for a year in November, I won't be reliant on him anymore so he is getting cut out the second I leave.
You’re literally my hero rn
Been there, don't recommend it - I ended up getting police called on me when I broke in anger and started breaking things.

Having criminal record is not worth it, I allowed myself to get provoked by mother and it will be day I will remember for long time.

Remove yourself from situation when anger gets too much, regardless if it's something important or just casual conversation.
sometimes you can't just move away tho
Yalls know about airhorn technology right? Plus it sounds hilarious
It's ok fam, I've got a lot of pent up emotion over this stuff too. I mean hell, my mom told me I couldn't be a trans dude bc I dated someone who was amab. I'm not even kidding. Apparently I can't be a gay guy because I'm ""technically a girl"" and every time she says this shit I feel like I'm gonna lose it
You okay buddy?
XD
I understand. I know nothing about your life situation. But “there’s no escape from freedom” as the philosopher said—you make choices and live with the consequences.
Sometimes subtlety can be overrated.
I honestly don't understand what you mean sorry
The person above is correct. 

I also agree though that moving out removes all that toxicity, but it ain't that simple in life. 

I have been trying to move away for 2 years now and it's impossible to find place willing to rent me.
Yeah i wanted to move away since i was 14 but i couldn't for... well, obvious reasons haha"	wloftw	trans	981	0.96	2022-08-11 10:50:56
I got super misgendered by a couple frat boys asking for help at work today		"[deleted]
uhm how did you getting misgendered? you look like a really good looking woman.
You’re beautiful😍
Clearly they were visually impaired.
Hugs!  As others have said you're beautiful as you!  So don't let anyone bother you.  Getting misgendered every once in a while when someone catching just the wrong angle, voice tone, or some other oddity is just part of being transgender.  Just take pride in living happily how you want to in life!
I mean everyone else has already asked the obvious questions of ""how"" and ""were they possibly visually impaired?""

I'm pre everything but with makeup and a mask I at least look like a mystery. I was wearing a bow in my hair, necklace, long nails with nail polish and matching toenails with sandals, pink top, skirt. Also it was dark. I still got called sir. I think a large flashing sign wouldn't be enough. I don't think being cis would be enough. Some people are looking to misgender people. They probably get a lot of misses, but if they stick to it and really work hard eventually they'll misgender an unclockable cute trans girl. That's the sort of sticktoitivness that built this great nation! 🙄
I got misgendered by room service several times. Don't worry about them. Be the best woman you can be
How could they misgender you? You look like a cis woman to me.
Hug
You're beautiful! Are they fucking blind or something?
You look amazing! I bet you’d look even more gorgeous with the flames of their burning fraternity dancing in your eyes
Sorry to hear that. We're here for support 💚
Just ignore them they're frat boys they have intelligence on par with one ply toilet paper left in chernobyl
What the heck you're a fine ass woman I woulda thought they'd be hitting on you
You're a beautiful woman! I would of thought they'd be hitting on you.
I don't understand, I would have taken you for a cis woman looking at you?
[removed]
You look amazing don't let the rudeness of a couple of man children get to you, you are valid and beautiful
What do you mean? They couldn't see you're a beautiful young woman?  
Well, If they can't see it, possibly they're in need of a new vision test.

&#x200B;

Be happy and be yourself, girl.
FUCK.THEM. You look great
No lie when i get misgendered i show that same energy by being racist Lmaoooo some people can handle it in which case I applaud thrm for where as me  it completely devastates my whole day yes i cry cuz damn im that ugly lol anyways i dont get misgendered anymore because of 6 years of hormones an plus I honestly hate the public anywayss i hope everything works out for you just keep in mind them some small dicc whiteboi krahhhkaahhhs fa you Lmaoooo
eat them
Maybe they were on the way to have their tested?  Maybe one was actually blind and the seeing eye moron?  You have NOTHING to worry about hun.
cute 😊😍🤗
Ok you're absolutely gorgeous and they are a bunch of sad little troll people
They could be nb
They could be FTM actually
Hey ignorance is bliss some people say. I believe they do it just to piss us off.
Maybe they heard her voice?
Likely they are being jerks. 

It’s the flavour right now. The propaganda says be mean to trans women so people do. Some times they aren’t even trans. Cis women who are a bit to tall or a bit to broad. 

They’ve got fuckin brain worms.
They could've heard her voice I guess?
She's mtf

My birthday is tomorrow and I’m going to be misgendered and deadnamed so much	"I’ve been out to my family for 5 months now, and they claim to be supportive but they just aren’t. My siblings are the closest but they exclusively use they/them for me when my pronouns are she/her, and they avoid any name and gender for me entirely, they literally refer to me as “that person”.

My father said he’d talk with me about it around a week after I came out, but it seems he’s decided to ask as though nothings changed, almost like he forgot. 

My mom is kinda a wildcard, she’s the only one whose ever used my name and pronouns , but she still misgenders and deadnames me daily more times than she’s used my pronouns and real name in total. 

They’ve decided to “compromise” on my name by just calling me “#1” as I’m the firstborn, they’ve only called me it a couple times, but that’s what my cake is going to have on it, and what they’ll sing to me. It’s dehumanizing. 

Can I please just get some well wishes and stuff? My name is Naomi and my pronouns are she/her, thank you !💕

Edit; my mom asked me what we were “going to do with my song” and I replied “my name is my name” and she said “yeah, but I can’t get him to realize that” and she pointed at my dad who was sleeping on the couch. According to my mom he won’t even talk about me being trans at all, and outright refuses to use my real name and pronouns, and my mom has been deadnaming me so he doesn’t get angry. She’s said that we are going to be using my real name, at least as of right now. I’m really happy that I can trust my mom, but it seems my dad sucks really hard.

Edit 2: My parents have gotten into a screaming match and at one point my dad said that I have no friends (untrue) and then asked the question of “what the fuck made him not want to be a boy” so I’m really glad I made this post and have a bunch of really nice messages to read while I hide in my room. Thanks everyone!"	"I'm sorry your family's being a bunch of butts, Naomi. I hope you have a happy birthday regardless, girl.
Sorry you are going through that sweetheart. And Happy Birthday Naomi you are beautiful, sweet, and kind Birthday girl. Sending you wishes, and love. And again Happy Birthday Naomi this is a special day the day the world got someone as great, awesome amazing person you don't ever forget it!!!
Naomi is a very cute name, they’re missing out by not having the experience of saying it
Ok so im petty, I remember seeing a post of someone taking an air horn and blasting every time someone was misgendered or deadnamed.
I'm sorry Naomi. That is very dehumanizing. I hope they come around and realize they shouldn't hurt you like this.
Could you just refuse to blow out your candles/eat with them if the cake says #1? Either way, happy birthday Naomi !!
A birthday girl deserves more respect, im sorry naomi. A number is no way to refer to a lady
Don't let these transphobic people get under your skin. There's no compromise, either you're something either you're not. And you're a girl. Nothing they do can chage that fact.
Happy birthday, Naomi!! 🎉🎂🎉 Hope you have a wonderful life and for you to feel happy! ☺️ Hope you can found people that accept you for who you are. I'm rooting for your happiness! ☺️ And remember the more the time passes less power people who don't accept you will have over you.
Happy Birthday Naomi! 

For SHE’s a jolly good girly
For SHE’a a jolly good girly
For SHE’a a jolly good girly!!!!
Which nobody can deny!
Hey sorry your family is being butts Naomi, maybe try talking with then and ask who the party is for tomorrow? Is it supposed to be for you or the family. If it's supposed to be for you ask them to use your name, even if they think it's silly or don't believe you just make it clear it's what you would want. If they say it's for the family then appreciate the honesty and say that's fine but you want to make your own cake for yourself with your name on it for later.

Hang in there Naomi sending lots of love for your birthday
Hey Naomi, I'm sorry that you're gonna have to go through this on your birthday. It sucks... Hang in there, okay?
Remember that while things might not seem too good now, everything will get better one day. Keep going. You're so strong.
Happy birthday, Naomi 💖
Im sending all my positive vibes Naomi. Happy birthday!!! 
-with much love, from your neighborhood toadman
Air horn, Aztec death whistle, or regular police style whistle. Have one of these, and every time you are misgendered, deadbamed, or when you deem right, blow into it or make the big loud noise.


Sounds crazy, but people are just big monkeys so this should work.
Wear a name tag with your pronouns on it. 
Get your own cake decorations for the cake brute blowing out the candles.
I am so sorry that is going on. Happy birthday and remember what they are saying is wrong and you are who you want to be.
Happy Birthday Naomi! I deal with the similar stupid shit from my family. I didn't put tags on any Christmas presents from me this past year because I wasn't trying to get uninvited from next year for the sake of my baby sister and cousins. I will cross my fingers and toes for you that your family comes around more quickly than mine.
Happy birthday Naomi! I'm sorry you have to go through that, you're a strong woman to deal with that.
I feel this. I currently live with family that still misgender me. Personally, I wanna say what I don't see other people saying: you have every right to say ""its my birthday, and if you're going to call me my deadname and disrespect me then I'm not doing any of this"". Then go spend the day with your friends and ppl who love you! Life is short, and not communicating your boundaries will let people think they can walk all over you. So let me remind you that you don't have to play along with their disrespect girl! Loving yourself sometimes means being mean to people who are hurting you, even if its hard. Either way, I hope you have a magickal birthday filled with all of your favorite things Naomi!! 💕💕💕💕
Naomi, your family sound like arses (much like mine unfortunately) but I hope you have an amazing birthday nonetheless. Enjoy your birthday, and make sure to have the best day  even if its just to spite your family! Keep your head up, because you are a beautiful powerful woman and everyone in r/Trans has your back! If you ever wanna chat w someone, my messages are open sister! - Sloan
Jesus. What kind of family decides to call one of their member ""Number 1"", imo it's extremely dehumanising. 
You deserve so much better, Naomi
Happy birthday girl!
Happy birthday, Naomi! You deserve all the cakes with your name on it in the world!
I very sorry for your family being such cold-hearted deniers. I know I went through this many years ago and my mother was the only one who evidentially came around, but she died, and I'm now left with the rest of the idiots who don't accept me at all. It might be that you will get to where you'll have to say so long forever to them or expect to hear your deadname from them forever. Just stay strong and real. **Happy birthday Naomi**, I know you're strong or you couldn't have gotten this far.
Hey girl! I hope your birthday is better and at least salvageable.. Your family sounds really hard to deal with and I'm really sorry they're have beetles in their goddamn ears.

You'll always have people here that respect you for who you are and I'm sending my love to you!

Also Naomi is such a beautiful name!

Best Wishes and Lots of Love❤️❤️❤️❤️
-Crow
hey sis, i’m sorry you’re family is being horrible to you :/ just know you have all of us here ready to support you to our fullest extent! i hope your birthday goes better than you expect. i understand how hard birthdays can be, ive had mine just a few months ago, the best of wishes to you :)

all in all, happy birthday naomi. i know it probably won’t be as special and as amazing, a beautiful girl like you deserves, but as i’d said before, i do hope it goes better than expected and you get all the gifts you’d asked for. also we will always be here for you naomi 🕺
It like an abuset compromising to not hit your face  but  ""just"" in the guts
Respect gets respect, don't get it in with your name then  roast them hard with a nickname that bugs them! Make it awkward, and do it right when they do it. A doctor of mine, got really upset when after deadnaming me and  I started saying their first name informally in our dialog like we were old friends
mine is today and i'm going to see my fam on friday. i feel you
Omg do we have the same father?! Anyway, happy birthday Naomie, I was in the same situation as you, remember that they will probably eventually call you with the right name and pronouns, and if not, you can find a second family who will love you, everybody have their place in this world!
Happy birthday Naomi! I wish you a very good birthday!! :))
My goodness your story sounds so much like mine. Except none of my family would ever name/gender me correctly. My birthday was last Friday and every card was addressed to my deadname
Happy birthday bestie!!! I'm sorry that you will be misgendered on your birthday. You are a unique and you deserve to be happy. Remember that your validation comes from within and i appreciate you and I'm happy that your birthday adds another year of your beautiful existence ❤️
Happy Birthday Naomi!!! I wish you the best of luck!!!!!💖
Sorry you have to deal with that :(
Aw come on, don't listen to them Naomi. You are valid. You deserve to be respected. I really hope you're doing well, and i hope you have a happy birthday!
Happy birthday Naomi!  Keep being amazing and don’t let your family get you down.
Happy birthday Naomi, I'm sorry to hear your family are being awful.
Send you all of my love and support Naomi. I hope it will be better for you one day 💗
Happy Birthdays Naomi! I'm so sorry your family are celebrating some number on your birthday instead of you

it really is a shame when families are so wrapped up and stuck in their ways instead of just recognizing and acknowledging the amazing young woman they have right there... lots of love darling <3

P.S. super cute name btw
Wishing a happy birthday to Naomi because she seems really cool and I hope her birthday is great. I know I phrased that really weird but it was the only way to fit in she and her.
Happiest soon to be birthday Naomi🎊🎉☺️!
Naomi; it sounds like they aren't transphobic, but are having trouble coming to terms with the change. You need to sit down with all of them and properly explain who you are and who you want to be. Tell them your pronouns and name, and correct them *every* time they get it wrong (that includes they/them or #1).

My mum quite often misgenders/deadnames me, but it is genuinely because she keeps forgetting. You've just gotta keep correcting them, even if it becomes annoying. I hope this helps. Good luck, sis! <3
That's a beautiful name Naomi
Happy birthday, Naomi!! I hope you have a supportive community to celebrate with and I wish you the best, my gal.
Hey Naomi! Happy birthday! I know how much it sucks to be deadnamed every day. I’m coming from a similar situation. I hope everything goes well!
Happy birthday Naomi! Your family is acting like a bunch of jerks, but r/trans always has your back <3
I'm sorry to hear about your family Naomi. You should let everyone know you don't want anything for your birthday except to be called by your true name and gender.

And there's nothing wrong with correcting them when they do wrong. Maybe they'll get sick of it and finally change what they call you. 

Oh, also Happy Birthday!
Happy Birthday Naomi, try to tune them out during the song and make that wish when you blow out the candle :)
Time to make a scene.
I'm sorry this is happening Naomi, I hope things change for the better girl, even if you have to kick and bite to make it happen.

Just correct them every single time they do it, be difficult, give no ground, and hopefully they will eventually they'll give up the old you, if only to get you to shut up about correcting them.
Happy birthday Naomi!! It's fully on your shitty ass family to not love you for who you really are, it's their loss for not being able to enjoy and cherish the real you.
You are me... same birthday and situation, happy early birthday though!
Whenever someone (who I’ve came out to) misgenders me I just exclaim loudly “WHO?” Until they get it right
Naomi is such a beautiful name! ❤️ you deserve to be treated as the beautiful woman you are. I'm sorry your family is coming up short. You're loved and valid no matter what.
Happy birthday Naomi, it's unfortunate that you have to go through this, but one day it'll all be behind you. If you ever need someone to talk to, whether that be that day, or whenever, I'll be here. Hope we made your day better Naomi, even if it's just a bit.
Ah your name is cute Naomi I’m sad to here that your family doesn’t use it more I hope you have a great day anyway girl! Your amazing and totally valid I hope they come around to realize who you really are. Happy birthday :) <3
Happy birthday Naomi! I hope the day goes by quickly and that you can have a fun celebration with your friends another day! You deserve much better than all this bullshit.
Happy bday, Girl! Man I'd make you a birthday card but I don't have any one me, and all my pens fried up as I was drawing. But hey, Naomi, don't give up! Don't let them make you feel down, your birth day is only happening once a year! They shouldn't put only #1 on that cake, they should write;

""Naomi, happy birthday, #1 girl on earth!""

Now get yourself some cake and be happy! 

Smile, it's your birthday! 

Live and love,

-Isabelle
I'm so sorry you have to go through that.  My family misgenderes and deadnames me all the time.  I get it, it's like being stabbed with a tiny knife over and over.

If I was in your situation, I would flat out just not be there for that party.  Go out with friends, come way after they are in bed.  Then post pics with my friends all over social media tagged with your name and pronouns.  That's what I'll most likely do for my bday.
happy early birthday naomi! i hope it goes well despite this horrible bit. im glad they're somewhat ""compromising"" most families would just say no right off the bat. maybe by next birthday they'll be singing your name~
Happy early birthday, Naomi. They may not be celebrating with you, but we'll happily celebrate your birthday tomorrow.

However, today we would like to celebrate the unbirthday of the wonderful young woman that you are, Naomi!
Your birthday is very close to mine, mine's on the 15th. I feel your pain my family refuses to even knowledge me being trans unless it's to make fun of me.
Sorry for a family like that, it made me feel horrible when my brother was saying stuff about me being bigender, I think he is sexist, and half of my family dose not know, but it sounds like your family just sucks, all of them
Horray for the beautiful birthday girl, miss Naomi!!
Happy Birthday Naomi!
My dad is the same. He claims to he supportive but bearly uses my name and pronouns
Happy birthday, Naomi!!!
Naomi is a beautiful name, and you have a happy birthday baby girl. ♥️♥️♥️
*Thats my name give it back*

Jokes aside, happy birthday Naomi from another Naomi! You got this girl, pull through aight?

A g e
Girl we have the same story basically except my sisters been supportive so I can’t pretend to relate there, but I know exactly what you’re feeling and that saddens me. It took about two years after I came out to my parents before they were ever able to have a conversation about it

I am here to tell that things get better, like I said my parents like yours claimed to be at first but weren’t, but I’m hoping for your sake that like my parents your parents will come around, I learned that sometimes they really do care and are supportive but it takes them time to process things, it’s not fair to us but people are people and that’s what it is just keep trying to be the bigger person, you will feel so much better in the long run when they come around and through out that journey. Obviously I don’t know how far along you are in you’re transition but I’m also telling you my story because I’m assuming that you aren’t that far yet and a piece of advice I would like to give is please don’t let your family’s lack of support hold you back like I did, I wasted so much time, I came out to them when I was 20 and didn’t start hormones until I turned 23 and I’ll be 25 end of this year. I wasted three years just getting on hormones waiting for their support. 
Things will get better, you will find your people and feel loved, I can assure you of that. 

Happy Birthday Naomi! 🎂🎉🎈
  -Love, Kayla
HAPPY BIRTHDAY NAOMI!!!🥳🥳
I'm sorry your family is being sucky and I hope they aren't  too bad
You're awesome and brave and regardless of how others treat you, you are valid and amazing in who you are🥰😍
People think they're being gender-neutral by saying ""child"" or ""#1"", but they're just being dehumanizing.
I’m sorry, Naomi. Totally not your fault that your dad is struggling with this. That is his problem. Perhaps your other family can sing your real name and if your dad says something else he will realize that he’s the only one being stubborn? I know that’s hard but I hope your mom can help you more by using your real name. I understand being afraid of the anger. If you are all safe of course, I hope your family can help stick up for you because you deserve it, Missy!

Edit: I’ve also always loved that name it’s so pretty!
As someone else who's birthday is today and is also trans, I feel you Naomi, birthdays can be painful when deadnaming and the such is happening :/
I hope you try to have a wonderful day outside of those situations
Happy birthday Naomi <3 coming from a fellow trans (15, ftm) member, if my family was going to refuse to put my correct name on my cake I would uninvite everyone and buy my own cake with the correct name lmao. they’re missing out on celebrating their daughter and their sister’s birthday. I hope it goes well and remember you’re always going to be and always will be the lady you were meant to be
Aww that sucks, I k ow how you feel

*hugs*

Happy birthday Naomi!
Happy birthday Naomi! Birthday girl! I'm so sorry your family is being awful! It sounds like the type you need to go no contact with when you're able.
Your birthday shall go well i hope…
Naomi you deserve to be treated like a princess, because you are one, happy birthday!
1st happy birthday Naomi,

2nd IMO you aren’t obligated to stick around you could leave or refuse to interact with anyone unless they use your name. If you gonna be dehumanised, you might as well ignore them like “An aNImAl”

Whatever you do, just remember you’ve got more people than just your mum on your side
Wait is ""that person"" rude? I always call people that to avoid misgendering anyone who may secretly be trans...
Aw Naomi 🥺 I really wish there was a way I could help you, that sounds like a terrible thing to go through. Hope you get better girl ❤️‍🩹
I really hope your dad stops being horrible and realises that he's making you dislike him. Have a lovely birthday Naomi, me and my little sloth will have you in our thoughts 😊
parents are really weird ... im basically in the same situation .. but i gladly only see my parents 1x month or so 🙈😅
my mom is like ""youre not a real girl yet so youre still my son""
Absolutely wild.. Imagine taking away someone's name and giving them a number as a 'compromise'

Sorry to hear about all this chick..
My birthday is today and im going through the exact same thing, im sorry you have to go through this. Sending hugs and support!
Happy birthday Naomi!

Turns out you have the same BD as my dad! Lol.

Hope those butts realize that you are a girl, Not whatever else.

Also, I love the name Naomi XD
i'm so sorry that this is going to happen to you, i really am, i know how much it hurts to be misgendered by someone that you're already out to. i wish you well and i hope your birthday doesn't suck that much, i wish you well Naomi!
If you have any friends go to their place for the day. Nothing sends message like letting them know that you hate being treated with no respect like telling them that you'd literally do anything else but be around them on your birthday.
Hi Naomi, I'm sorry your birthday isn't looking that promising at the moment. I hope it turns out better than expected, girl. 🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈🎈
This sounds semi-similar to my situation. My dad isn't ""ready"" for it yet so my mum and my brother still mostly deadnames and misgender me. It's why I haven't told my extended family yet despite having come out at work and to my friends and having full support there ...

Idk what to do tbh. I just kinda know what you feel, Naomi.

*hugs*
Happy birthday to you, Naomi! I’m wishing you the absolute best on your journey with your transition 🎂❤️
I'm late to the party since I only woke up to a notification of this particular post today, but being disrespected and dead named (or numbered) to your face constantly as well as on such an important day isn't right to anyone, happy birthday Naomi, and best wishes! I hope all goes well!
I am sorry u are going through this Naomi, i wish you the safest, comfiest and happiest birthday. know that there is ppl out there that dont compromise and accept you and love you as you are 💞🏳️‍⚧️
Tbh I feel like it's pretty likely that everyone in your family was trying not to piss off your dad, hopefully he realizes quickly he is making a huge mistake by not supporting you and getting angry at others for doing so. Happy birthday 🫂
On a day when you’re supposed to be the birthday bitch they the ones being bitches. Hbd Naomi I hope things gets better for you. You shouldn’t have to put up with that shit.
I am so sorry your family is treating you that way. You do not in any way deserve to be treated poorly. If it means anything, we are here for you. Happy birthday Naomi.
hey naomi, happy birthday!! i’m so sorry to hear about your family— mine does this to me, and it sucks. it’s YOUR birthday, not theirs! my advice is: have your own celebration either the day before, earlier in the day, or the day after. my family subscribes to the birthday month, and i use that as an excuse to go hang out with my friends as much as i possibly can— we go on roadtrips, play video games, watch movie marathons, feed our dogs puppacinos and just generally hang out and have fun. it’s also really good to have like a birthday activity you really look forward to— i’m a huge science nerd, so i drag people to museums on my birthday. just try to have fun, and not let them get you down— you’re the birthday girl, and you should have the best time imaginable!
Ngl calling you #1 is kinda dehumanizing
Sorry if this isn't really relevant, but I love the name ""Naomi"", it's really beautiful, I hope you can have a happy birthday despite of this, Im sure u are a beautiful girl. ^^
Happy birthday, Naomi!

Everyone, wish her a happy birthday!

Naomi, (lovely name, BTW) it sounds like your mom is trying to get your dad to come around diplomatically.  He’s probably struggling with “my first born son” issues and is having difficulty coming to terms with the idea of “first born daughter.”  It takes time with men brought up in male dominated society and the idea of “now I can raise my little boy to be just like me.”

It’s good that you have a supportive mom and that she’s trying (even with mistakes).  It will take time.  The best thing you can do is to just be you and lead by example.

Also, don’t respond to your dead name.  If they keep using it and get frustrated with you.  Simply say, “Oh, I’m sorry.  I thought you were speaking to someone else!  Hello, my name is “Naomi!”  I’m very pleased to meet you!”
Naomi's a beautiful name though...
I never understood the point of view those kind of people 

Stay strong ♥️ and happy birthday 😊
i’m so sorry naomi :( happy birthday girl!
Happy Birthday Naomi! Love the name btw my Name is Joey/Jade either one, hope your birthday is going well
Happy birthday Naomi!
Happy Birthday Naomi!
i'm on the same situación, so yeah, It sucks
Happy birthday Naomi!
I know this feeling Naomi and I'm so sorry you have to go through it, nobody deserves this type of disrespect
happy birthday Naomi 🎉
I had the same sort of issue, but I'm not out yet. It's hard, but I'm sure you'll get through it. If you have any friends or a partner that will use your correct name and pronouns, I'd probably try and hangout with them somehow. It would be reassuring. Good luck at the birthday party :)
Happy birthday Naomi. I’m sorry you are going through this. Do you have any friends that live nearby you could stay with?
Happy birthday to you, Naomi, I'm sure you're an amazing woman and you definitely deserve better than this, I wish you health and better people in your life, that will actually admire and be grateful for you 🫂💜
Happy birthday girl!!!!
Just leave the horrible family members behind and move on. It's hard I know but ive done it before and it's very freeing. If you can't move out then act like they don't exist. If they can't treat you right then why go through the trouble of dealing with them? Put your emotions and feelings on hold and say fuck them and move on. Yeah they're family but it doesn't make a difference. Toxic is toxic. Family doesn't get special treatment.
happy birthday naomi, so proud of you sweet girl :) you'll get through this!
Happy Birthday Naomi

Dont know whats the right thing to do in that situation so im not gonna risk telling u any bs. 
I can only tell u that im sorry for ur struggling! <333
Happy Birthday Naomi! I hope your birthday kicks ass!
You're family's being assholes right now and I'm sorry for what you're going through. You'll get through this, and happy birthday, Naomi! <33 I don't know if you'll get this reference, but you're a mermaid. They're just shrimp. Don't listen to the opinions of shrimp. Have a great day and many more to come.
HAPPY BIRTHDAY DEAR BIRTHDAY TWIN
First, Hau'oli la hanau, Naomi!

Here might be a cheeky way to answer your Dad's rude question: ""Well, Dad, since I got half of my genetic material from you, there's at least a fifty percent chance *you made me this way.*""

And smile sweetly while you say it, but be ready to run.
Happy birthday to you Happy birthday to you HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO NAOMIIIII!!🥳🎂 HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO YOU!

Thank you so much, it means a lot!❤️
Thank you!💕
Ong such a cute name
I’m tempted but if I’m way to non-confrontational to do that, I’m tempted to only call my parents by their legal names though, but legally I’m named after my dad and I don’t wanna be saying my deadname all the time. The nuclear option would be to refer to everyone by their SSNs. My parents are incapable ~~for~~ of filing taxes so they make me file their taxes, I’ve got all of them.
Mine would be to bring a bunch of pennies and a jar. Each time they get it wrong, I put a penny in the jar. Each penny would represent one (1) dollar I will donate to Planned Parenthood. My parents are hardcore catholics and so they hate Planned Parenthood. Think this would be a good motivator??
Thank you! And I hope so too!
Happy cake day 🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂🎉🎂
I could do that, but it would make a scene and I hate confrontation, and I hate the spotlight. Like when I came out my mom tried to convince me to not be trans cause “everyone will be staring at you”. I’m tempted to make my own cake just so I can put my name on it.
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you so much!💕 I have a very close circle of friends (2 of which are also trans, just not mtf) and they help a lot!
Thank you so much!💕 Your song has me with the widest grin right now
I still live with my parents so we aren’t really throwing a party with alot of people, it’s just gonna be my parents and siblings (both of which also still with my parents). Thank you for the idea though!💜
Thank you, I’m trying!💕
Thank you so much Toadman!🐸💕
I’m tempted but I feel like that would only result in me being screamed at or something. I might do that when I don’t live with my parents anymore, just in case.
Thank you!💞
Yeah, I don’t think my immediate family (except maybe my dad) is outright transphobic, I think they just don’t realize how big of a deal it is to me. Thank you and I hope your family comes around too!
Thank you!💗
Thank you so much!❤️ I really need to work on being more assertive, but I’m really shy and I don’t want to “rock the boat”. If it gets really bad tomorrow I might try and do what you suggested!
Thank you so much Sloan! I didn’t expect nearly this much support, it’s amazing!💕
Thank you💕! I thought I was overreacting about it when I saw “#1 Birthday” on the calendar and started crying, it’s great to see that other people find it as ridiculous as I do!
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much!💞
Thank you so much! 💕
Thank you so much!
Yeah, that what it feels like, and even then they still hit me in the face (metaphorically) all the time. Like my mom literally sat next to me while I cried about how much I hate being called by my deadname, but the next day she was still using it. And this was well over 2 months ago
I would love to do that, but my parents are kinda stupid. It’s one of those “it’s fine when I do it but not fine when you do it” kinda things, they’re massive hypocrites and don’t even realize they are hypocrites. I have been tempted to do it thought, and since it’s my birthday I just might!
Well in that case, Happy Birthday Beautiful! I checked your profile just to double check pronouns and I saw your selfie, you are actually really pretty, at least to me! Yeah It’s also great to find another transfem one piece fan!
Thank you! I have a very close knit group of friends that I already consider a second family (even if I haven’t told them yet)
Thank you!💞
I’m so sorry, hopefully both our family become better eventually!💗
Thank you!💞
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!
Thank you!💗
Thank you!💞 and I hope so too!
Thank you so much💜! And thanks for the name compliment, I picked it out myself (lmao)
Thank you! And it wasn’t structured that weirdly, and an even bigger thank you for working in my pronouns!💗
Thanks for the advice! I’m going to try and do that!
Thank you so much💕! I picked it out myself, lmao
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you so much!💞
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you so much!❤️
TYSM!💕
Thank you!💗 I’ve thought about doing that but I really dislike conflict and the spotlight, so while I think about doing it I probably won’t be
Thank you so much!💜
In that case, Happy Early Birthday to you too beautiful, hopefully our day is better than we think it is!❤️
Lmao, that’s a great idea! I might try that! Thanks💞
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you! All this support is really helping!💕
Thank you so much😊
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much Isabelle!💕
That sounds like a great idea, it’s too bad my friends either have work, school, or just live too far away. I will definitely have a late birthday celebration though! Thank you!💕
That’s what I’m hoping! Thank you💕!
Thank you so much!💕
I’m so sorry, my family has at least mostly chosen to ignore it, I’m not outright made fun of. Happy  Early Birthday handsome (I checked your account for pronouns and saw your post about a binder, I really hope you are okay with being called handsome, if not I’ll edit!). Hopefully your family gets better, and if not I hope you can at least find a second family that loves you for who you are!
Yeah, I’m particularly worried since my family is much more accepting than my cousins, they legit might try and hurt me if they knew. I hope your family grows to accept you!
Thank you so much!❤️
Thank you!💗
That sucks, hopefully both our dads get better!
Thanks!💞
Thank you so much!💜 it’s really cool to meet another Naomi, our name isn’t one of those super popular ones, but it’s a really good name!
Thank you! My situation is kinda weird, I got my hrt through Folx and so I was able to kinda do it under their noses, but I came out to them around 3 days after I started. I’m currently 5 months on hrt and my egg cracked almost a year ago (closer to 11ish months ago). So I’m still pretty early in my transition but I definitely won’t let them stop me! I’m really glad your parents finally came around, and I definitely hope mine come around too!
Thank you!💞
Thank you so much! And I really hope he’ll get more used to the idea, I think part of the issue is that I was supposed to be his “namesake”, like my name was [my dad’s name] II, so maybe he’s upset about that or something. I’m really hoping he doesn’t make a scene or anything.
Thank you! And I hope you have a happy birthday too!💕
Thank you so much!❤️
Thank you!💜
Thank you!💕 I’ve debated going no contact, I should be finishing my degree by the end of the year, and me and a friend (another trans person who’s parents aren’t great, but they’re in the closet rn) are planning on getting an apartment or something. For me it all depends on if they get better or not by then, if not then I guess it’s no contact for a bit.
Thanks!💛
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!💕
It’s more dependent on how they say it, we were playing Minecraft and they were using it as a way to avoid saying any name for me, cause while they don’t wanna deadname me, they also have never once said my real name. I respect them for trying but when you’re just hanging out and they say “where is that person” and you’re sitting right there. It’s more about them refusing to use my name
Thank you!❤️
Thank you! During my rant to my mom last night I did tell her that he’s making me resent him, I’m not sure if she’ll tell him that or not though. I’m hopeful he just needs a lot of time, he’s a nearly 60 year old army guy (was never active duty) who worked in construction for 30 years, one of the most typical mans mans there could be, I can kinda get him struggling that his “son” is now his daughter
That’s horrible, I hope your parents come around eventually!
Thank you! I probably should’ve said this in my edit but I did tell my mom I find the #1 thing dehumanizing, so hopefully that’ll stop now
Thank you! And happy birthday to you too!💛
Thank you!💕
Thank you!💜
I’m tempted but all my friends have work or school today and I don’t have a car I can use (we’ve had some car issues and the spare I normally used fully died) thanks for the suggestion though!💗
Thanks!💕
That terrible, hopefully both our dads stop being butts!
Thank you so much!💜
Thank you!❤️
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you! I really hope so too!
Thank you!❤️ I’m hoping they get better with time!
Thank you!💕
Thank you so much! I am doing some stuff with my friends on my birthday, I’m running a short DND session in around an hour and half, and I’m really looking forward to it!
Thanks, I thought so too but was worried I was overreacting
Thank you💛! And even if it isn’t entirely relevant it’s so nice to hear I have a pretty name!
Thank you so much!💗
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much! I really like your names too! I’ve got a friend who has 2 first names kinda like you!
Thank you!❤️
That’s not great, hopefully both our family get better
Thanks!❤️
Thank you!💛
Thank you!💜
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you! And I kinda don’t, 2 of my friends live too far to walk (I don’t have a car rn), and the other 2 have work or school. I am going to be playing some DND with them eventually though, so that’s going to be fun!
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you!💗
Yeah, I kinda plan to do that, I’m basically trying to keep my head down and just finish my schooling (online college bachelors courses) and once I’m done I plan to move out with a friend, and unless they get a lot better by then I plan to go no or extremely low contact with them
Thank you so much!💕
Thank you!💛
Thank you so much!💕 I’m really hoping they get better, but if not I guess I’ll just have to cut them out of my life
Thank you!💜 I’m really hoping things get better over time!
Thank you!💜
Thank you!💕 and have a happy birthday too!
Thank you!❤️
A delusion is literally a medical term used by psychologists, and psychologists themselves acknowledge that trans people are not under a delusion, we are an exception. Might as well just start calling me out for illnesses I don’t have
Bold of you to assume I’m getting buried
I mean, I’d hope so? I think you’re a bit confused

Edit for context since this comment is guaranteed to get removed they said “they will use your real name when they bury you”
Do you have any plans?
Anytime Naomi, 😊. If you ever need someone to talk, vent or what ever just dm. We sisters stick together
Naomi is my most favorite name! As a kid I always named my dolls Naomi. I want to be your friend so I can have a friend named Naomi! So pretty!
Oh PLEASE do that, that would be hilarious.

The way they are dehumanizing you.. That's not ok. I'm sorry you are going through this Naomi.
Happy birthday honey, I wish you well
Or you could call your mom incubator and your dad gamete giver
Stand strong, madam! Not one step back!
You can also refer to them with the wrong pronouns anytime they misgender you. If they speak up about it, be like now you know how I feel
Sounds like the ultimate motivator
Definitely do that!! You could even decorate it with the trans flag maybe? It would be a good moment to explain how hurtful what they're doing is
Happy birthday sister. May it be another step closer to freedom <3
You can tell them that you won’t attend if they misgender you.
:D <3
It is ridiculous. This is obviously not about them not being able to adapt to your new name.

This is them denying you the basic respect you're owed by adapting themselves to a derogatory term they consciously chose to use to refer to you.

I struggle to see this as anything other than transphobia.
i seen your update, i’m really sorry that happened, i hope it gets better buddy
>Yeah, that what it feels like, and even then they still hit me in the face (metaphorically) all the time

Ye abusers don't often stick to their own made ""compromises"".

I think refuse the cake you are not a number or an no name, ignore them if they don't say your name or pronouns etc that often works. But just do it if you are not at risk of physical abuse.
girl my jaw dropped after reading that, thank you so much for the compliment! also i agree it's always nice (and also quite unexpected) to meet another transfem One Piece fan. happy early birthday, sis! :D
Lol that's what I always say too
I guarantee you'd feel great for getting it off your chest instead of silently dealing with it. 

Of course you should only do what you're comfortable with, but it won't stop accidentally.
Thank you!❤️
Lol road trip!
Thanks, and Happy Early Birthday to you :)
That sounds like a good plan! No better roommate than a fellow friend of blahaj.
Naomi is suck a pretty name btw
Oh that's annoying I would make them pay me everytime muahaha
Yeah, it sucks that being transgender isn't really widely discussed in a neutral sitting and people that are ignorant don't want to learn, the world would be a lot better if people would just educate themselves on people. I'm kinda going off topic here but it drives me insane that people think that we chose to be like this and judge us based on that. Who in their right mind would choose to be judged for literally everything.
Np just don’t get your hopes up. Cis folk just don’t get it.
You're very welcome. You are a valid and loved human being. Anyone would be lucky to be your friend.
oh, that’s awesome! have fun!
Yes u do! ^^
ofc <3
Thanks only a few of my friends know about the two first names haven't told my parents though I'm thinking about it. Hope your doin well! 😁😋
i hope so (:
Sorry about everything your going through 😔 but remember it's still YOUR day! 😊
The first weeks are always the hardest leaving family behind but it gets a lot easier after.💕
I bet they will. Stay strong <33
<3

Not really, I played some DND with a friend earlier, but aside from that no
Thank you so much! That means a lot, and I’d love to be your friend!💗🥰
Birther and donor
I would but I live with them, so that isn’t really an option, we are also having car troubles right now so I can’t even drive away. At best I could walk somewhere but I can’t make it too far
I am a grown adult and my parents are getting old, if it came down to blows I’d easily win (though I’d much rather it not come to that), so I’m in no threat of physical violence at least. Thanks for the suggestion! I might do that if they’re particularly bad
>Thank you!❤️

You're welcome!
Lmao, that would be a really fun idea!
I have been tempted to make a deadname and misgender jar, but I’m worried that my dad wouldn’t care and wouldn’t pay, so my mom would “cover his tab” basically. He used to have a problem where he’d “borrow” our money and never give it back, and then my mom would give us some of her money to “pay his debts”
I 100% agree, this world would be far better if people were just more willing to learn about those around them
🥰🥺
I see what you mean, I thought you were being transphobic about the whole deadname on tombstone thing. Sorry for assuming! And you make a good point, I’ve gotta stress this just in case something happens.
That’s still a party.
That ducking sucks
Oh that'sucks"	u2u9r9	trans	947	0.96	2022-04-13 16:29:09
guess who isn’t getting misgendered while wearing this !!		"Ikr!! Perfect time for us !!
ur so pretty omg
metro diner!! r u from the midwest? i love it there
I know right! Hate how they feel but love the way I don't get misgendered while wearing them.
How long did it take you to grow your hair that long?
Ur curlsssss
Love it! And kudos to you for not being misgendered.
Saaaaame. I love it. Just like I love those curls!!!
that's awesome to hear
those curls are so adorable on you
So happy for you! And just wanna say you've got really pretty eyes!!
Isn’t it great? I was out in boymode last week and male failed for the first time!
Can still tell your beautiful with it on tho😍
You are so pretty even behind a mask.  😍
You go girl! Youre beautiful. Love your hair!
Absolutely gorgeous
Omg it's like the perfect excuse for a masquerade!!! I love it.
Your eyes are pretty
Coronavirus lord and saviour.
damn, wish i could relate lol. i’ve never been misgendered as much as i have this past month
Guess who doesn't appear to be wearing a bra.
So what are you exactly
Easy mistake
I live near a metro diner in Alabama
a year and a half
Not sure why this is downvoted... let your titties be free, girl!
excuse me?
Oh cool, I guess I'm halfway there. Did you have to straighten it some or does it just grow like that?
Yeah. I'm not saying it's a bad thing. I'm not saying it's a good thing. I'm saying ""Look at the tiddie!""
What gender is you?
it grows like this. i’m scared to straighten my hair lol
You're so lucky! My hair is super curly, I guess it would be 4c. It looks like an inch and a half when left alone but stretches to like 5 inches. I'm thinking I'll need to get it straightened or something eventually..."	gddl0w	trans	908	0.99	2020-05-04 15:25:31
I Keep Being Discriminated By My Lesbian Friends For No Reason And I don't know why (Vent)	"So I am A Trans-Fem person and I have a lot of Lgbt Friends however a few of my lesbian friends have all started calling me a fake girl and saying I'm a guy and always will be. They keep misgendering me on purpose as well as trying to belittle me whenever I say anything. I know it's stupid but it's really hurting my mental state as I was finally starting to be content with myself but now I have just had terrible thoughts that I'll never be good. Also I Have Nothing bad against anyone or any sexuality They have just started to do this to me lately but they were perfectly fine with me before I came out and it's damaging my mental health a lot.

Update: Thank you to everyone for the responses I had a talk with them and have now left them since they were purposely doing it and just wanted to hurt me. Thank you to everyone once again 💜"	"they are NOT your friends! they are transphobic!! simple as that!!! cut them out of your life!! they don't deserve someone like you. make friends with people who accept you and actually want the best for you.
That's not what a friend does.  The girls that are treating you this way have no understanding of transgender women or transfemmes.  If they're otherwise wonderful friends, you can try to sit them down one-on-one and talk to them about it.  But be careful as it may do more damage to you than is worth it.

Trans issues are at the forefront of debate topics currently, it's unfortunate but a lot of people are just cruel to trans folks or people they perceive as trans.  

Trans-exclusionary rhetoric is common.  Unfortunately, sometimes there's nothing to be said that will change someone's views on this.  Thankfully not everyone is like this, there are tons of wonderful inclusive folks out there who will see you for you without feeling the need to tear you down.
That’s pretty blatant transphobia, these people are not friends
“Friends”

Found your mistake. There’s better people out there. Find them.
Even people in the LGBTQIA community can be transphobic trash.

They are not your friends.

Gentle comforting hugs if wanted.
Those ain’t friends
It’s possible for queer people to be transphobic your friends sound hella transphobic you might want reevaluate your friendship
it isn’t stupid to be upset by that, that’s blatant transphobia and is considered hate speech in progressive countries. those lesbians are probably TERFs (trans exclusionary radical feminists, aka white feminists) so fuck them. please learn to respect yourself, you don’t deserve that treatment. please find better people, there are better people out there.
yea, those are not friends.
Wow what kind of douchebag terfs are they ?
I think these people are just fake friends who will never actually be real friends no matter what they do. Your friends are a bunch of FARTs, and you should tell them to shove it.
YOu need new friends.
i understand what you’re going through, they’re transphobic just because they’re part of the Lgbt+ doesn’t mean they cant be (homo)transphobic, maybe talk to them if they don’t accept you and keep making fun of you and saying transphobic things, dump them, they’re stupid and don’t respect you as a person you’re better without them, good luck<33
Their sexuality is not a get out of jail free card! Don't forget that.
Sounds like the connection has become toxic
they are NOT your friends, that's for sure. trust me, there are plenty of lesbians who are NOT transphobic/terfy. hoping u find ur people soon 💜
Ditch em! Throw the whole group away! They're not worth your companionship. Better friends are out there, I promise (including lesbians that aren't transphobic). You may wanna seek more friends that are trans, they're more likely to understand why misgendering hurts and are more likely to gender you correctly.

Edit: accidentally pressed send way too early
girl they are NOT your friends! they suck. please cut them off and find some actual decent people to be around.
Sounds like they're not you're friends and are just transphobic lesbians
That happened to me at work. When I started transition I figured I would make friends with the lesbian crowd at work. This was not the case. They refused to talk to me or help me with projects. Eventually they all quit. I couldn’t believe it. But some cis gender chicks got hired and we are besties.
It's sad but there's an unusually large number of TERFs in the lesbian community. We're all the targets of hate why would we fight amongst ourselves.
Those aren’t your friends, they’re probably TERFs. If you weren’t already aware, TERFs are fascists masquerading as feminists. Distance yourself from them.
They are not your friends sister. If they deny your womanhood they are just being transphobic and do not deserve your friendships.
That's very blatantly transphobic of them, and you are not stupid for being upset about it. You have every right to be hurt, because what they are saying to you is textbook transphobia and discrimination. I'm so sorry you have to deal with that. You should confront them and if they don't change,  I'd recommend finding some more supportive friends
Gold star lesbians are the worst. There's already a lot of terfdom in the queer community but especially so in the lesbian community. Like others have said, these women are not your friends and you're better off not associating yourself with them.
They are not your friends. That sounds like blatantly transphobia
They are unfortunately part of the LGB+ community that doesn't respect the T. While I get trauma related adversions to being sexually with someone, there's a very thick line for friends who have no reason to say these things to you. 

This is coming from someone, who, even as someone with very supportive (all afab, female or nonbinary female alligned) friends, as a nonbinary trans man, sometimes feels invalidated by comments or things.

All in all, I get your feelings, if you want to DM me, feel free, and even though your situation is problematic while mine is more of friends who forget how language might affect me, I understand the dilemma.
I'm so sorry to hear you are going through this. I went through the same. I am a trans male and I received less support from my Gay and Lesbian friends, instead of from cisgender friends. I had to call their attention several times and ultimately leave behind some of them. To two of them I had to threaten with legal repercussions to their unfair and not legal actions. There is a lot of legal help if you even need to address this at a different level. But mostly I can advise you to get away from people like that. You do not need permission nor approval to live your life the way you feel inside. I started my transition about 3 years ago and I already changed all my legal status (name/gender/documents) and had the reassignment surgeries already. That process of contouring my physical appearance and make my face more masculine, was the hardest as I was a pretty female looking gal. I immediately designed my eyebrows to a more masculine appearance and since I was already a masculine self, it wasn't hard. I pull away from family, ""friends"" and toxic people. If they can't at least respect me for who I am then I don't need them in my life, period. If they are your friends, they will never harm you, especially emotionally, so my advise it to stop talking, hanging out with them or letting them into your life. YOU and ONLY YOU have control over your life, they don't matter. You know you are a woman and that is what everyone else should call you and see you like, they don't need to understand, approve or intervene on your decisions. The truth is, that we will always cross with stupidity and it is only up to us to react to it. Sometimes by giving them silence and avoid them (like if they were a piece of crap, as they are acting like), you tell them more. Ignoring people sometimes help them to see how awful they can be to us. Some without intellectual intelligence, won't get it, but again there is nothing you can do for them. DO FOR YOU, as you are the most important person in your life.
no no not you friends please drop them thats not what friends do, i hope your doing better!
They are not your friends. It’s not stupid to be upset by that. I would definitely cut off contact. This is why I’m wary of cis lesbians.
[deleted]
T E R F ‘s
You should've called them ""Fake lesbians"" Lmao they would've gone crazy!
What age range are we talking here? Because this is some mean girls high school bullshit that even adult transphobes don't do.
They don't sound like friends to me. Honestly, the cis lesbians who act this way really remind me of the hyper masculine straight men who are so afraid of the possibility of being attracted to a woman with a penis that they turn it into aggression, hated, and even violence. They aren't above it just because they're queer. Being a woman attracted to women doesn't automatically make you a feminist.
They’re not your friends. Friends wouldn’t do that to you. I know it’s hard to cut off friends but please try to get some friends that respect you. I went onto dating apps and swiped on every trans person I could find, a good amount ended up becoming my friend. I’m not saying only hang out with other trans folks, but it’s honestly refreshing when most of your friends are the same marginalized group as you. I wish you the best of luck and please find supportive friends
Those are not friends.
So you’re telling us they’re not your friends anymore …

Don’t keep space in your life for toxic people even if they weren’t toxic in the before times.
I couldn’t imagine saying this stuff to someone I consider a friend. They suck and you deserve better. ♥️
They are not your friends and will never be.  Get away from them, and block them.  Been there!
Ummmmm fuck them. They’re transphobic and not being okay at all!
Get yourself some better friends.
You should probably get new friends and stop talking to those girls.
that’s not stupid!!! they’re stupid tbh, ur a woman and they shouldn’t be belittling you. pls drop them bae
You are so beautiful inside and out, don't let anyone bring you down, I love you 🥰
They are assholes and should be treated as such
When someone shows you the kind of person they are, do yourself a favor and believe them.
shit ass friends
They are TERFs, ditch them and cut contact
Glad to hear the update because they didn’t  sound like friends to me
They must be Rowling fans or smth, TERF lesbian and gay people are the weirdest man
That just means they are terfs. Don't fall for their lesbian bullshit, discrimination is discrimination and being a minority doesn't excuse their behavior.
They're not friends. Period. You deserve better than whatever those people are.
Where did this happen?  I'm so sorry they did this to you!
Sounds like terfs
Sounds like a bunch of TERFs
already saw the update, but i still want to say it anyway; they don't deserve you at all. it's not the same thing but, ironically, i've had the same thing happen to me with cis lesbians, but in reverse because im a trans guy (so they'd misgender me as a girl). when people do things like that, it has nothing to do with your actual gender, sometimes cis people are just dicks on purpose, and it's not stupid at all to be upset about it. your boundaries matter, and you deserve better friends. glad you figured it out.
Good for you getting out of there. Friends might rib each other good naturedly but never to hurt. I hope you are able to find some real friends who make you feel like the angel you are.
most of the people in the comment section are incredibly right about telling you that they are terfs and cutting them off, but i also would like to add (i also made this mistake in the past a lot):  though, you may trust cisgender lgbtqia+ folks with your gender identity since you are in the same community as them, please remember that cisgender people will unfortunately never be able to understand our identities like us trans folks do and they usually cannot give the support you desire. i recommend being present in communities that are more towards transgender people. because people that are cisgender (regardless of if they are in the community or not) as i mentioned, they cannot relate to us or even understand our identities. so, they will not be able to bond with you over your gender identity or give you the support that you need. if you become present in more transgender-related communities, you might actually find people that understand you and make meaningful connections!
This right here. Anyone who would deny you as yourself is not a friend
Was just about to say this. If your friend (or lover) does something regularly that they know genuinely hurts you, guess what they don't fucking deserve you.
nothing radical about biological essentialists pretending to be critical of gender.
>aka white feminists

What the actual f*** ..
There have been many cis lesbians who have been transphobic since at least the early '70s.
Junior year highschool :/
So should I believe I'll never be able to be a girl or am I reading it wrong
idk that’s just what they’re called. and they don’t like it either, so i very much enjoy using the term 😆
“Biological essentialists” who don’t even recognize that sex is a phenotypical trait and is thereby influenced by secondary sex traits, tertiary sex traits, etc.
Agree, we need to stop saying TERF every time someone says something shitty.  Someone being shitty to trans people doesn’t make them a TERF, but all TERFs are shitty to trans people.

I suspect *very few* people labelled as TERFs are even feminists let alone rad fems.
LMAO, well said

Edit: They're a little confused, that's all !evilgrin!
it’s not literally white people who are feminist, it’s white feminism. basically feminists who don’t give a shit about anyone but the middle-upper class white cis women
Yeah I don't think you're getting what I'm saying haha

I'm trying to tell you that these people are horrible people and you should believe them now that they've made it very clear. (And act accordingly.)
And the fact that all ""babies"" start out as female and are affecting by different things (can't remember exacts) to form the male gender, and sometimes the brain stays in the female form. So why not adhust the shell to fit?? I salute transgenders who become their true form of inner and outer beauty..
You can still use TERF; just be sure to clarify that it stands for Trans Exclusionist Reactionary Fascist
Ah. Yeah that definitely could’ve been phrased better lol"	xau9xw	trans	892	0.98	2022-09-10 17:00:05
People who think it's a good idea to train call centre staff to use sir/madam or Mr/Mrs <last name> need to stop	"They have my name, why can't they just use that instead of misgendering me purely on what I can assume is my voice as nothing on my account says I'm a ""sir"". 

They have my title on my account too, that says ""Mx"". Use that if you must...

I hate it. 

It doesn't sound more professional and you're guaranteed to misgender any non binary person for no reason."	"Not that I disagree but I think it's because a lot of older folk will feel disrespected when they are not called ""sir"" or ""ma'am""?
I used to work in a tech service call center, and always started my calls ""and who am I speaking with today?"" after my intro. It was already a requirement to verify they are the primary account holder before I could disclose anything anyway, so I just always referred to them as whatever name they gave me... It's definitely not that hard to avoid!

Got called sir, after setting up my last appointment with that medical centre before I can go on E
I actually currently work at a call center and it's so easy to just.. not use the gendered language. Just drop it, the message is exactly the same.

""Alright, thank you for holding sir""  = ""Alright, thank you for holding.""  No one even notices.

Actually this year I've decided to just drop all pretenses. I'm just like ""I'm back."". I haven't gotten any negative feedback from customers or supervisors so, fuck it. Politeness is over.
We stopped with that in the 60s in Sweden, and I am so glad we have such a relaxed way of referring to people. English should really adopt it and ditch those old ass ways of talking.
Comrade.
When I worked in customer service, I made it a point to never use these kinds of gendered terms with customers. This should be the norm.
In the Philippines, we have mamsir which is a gender neutral ma'am or sir. In our culture, the word has gained its own meaning enough that most people wouldn't even infer a binary with mamsir. For example, when going through security, they will just say mamsir and it's widely accepted as a gender neutral respectful way to refer to someone, even if they are an older person.
As someone who works in a call centre, I do my best to avoid even calling people their name or terms like sir/madam, as it does cause issues. I ask them to confirm their name for me (spelling it out of need be) but other than that I always refer to people as simply ""you"". 

I'm probably in the minority for doing this, and some people may take offence to it (somehow) but I've not had any complaints or objections yet.

Hi! I work in a call center!

I can't speak for everyone on this matter, but I generally go by name or by generally avoiding any gendered language. Then again, I'm also in a position where I know better. I'll use those terms if and only if the customer has made their gender very clear in some way or another (""Hey, I'm a man. Of course I didn't read the instructions!"" or ""Look at us, using girl power to solve this issue!"").

I'm thankful my voice passes really well over the phone, but it didn't always; I know what it feels like when people make assumptions. Every ""sir"" feels like an emotional punch to the gut.
I'm a supervisor for a call center and it's in the FUCKING PROCEDURES to use Mrs/Miss/Mr. If you don't they will literally knock you on QA monitoring. I still refuse to do it and advise my agents not to and dispute the QA every single fucking time. 

And honestly, not only is it more respectful to use, but also cis people freak the fuck out if you misgender them. They expect us to deal with it every day but you call little miss Morgan sir/Mr. and she loses her shit. Or even more annoying, if you use Mrs. instead of Ms. for a woman (yes, I've heard someone complain about that on the phone when monitoring an agent).

If you just use their name none of that matters. You call them what they specially told you to call them.
most call centre roles I have worked always expected you to use customers first name always. but when I have trained overseas call centre staff they always seem more prone to sir/madam kind of responses.
I work on the phone all day and just use their first and last name + they/them in my notation
Definitely agree. Also staff need to be trained to understand preferred names and why people use them. 

I recently had to make a police report and said my name is Sebastian - which it is. The woman on the phone referred to me as Sebastian. Great. But I also had to provide legal information so I say “(redacted) is my legal name, I go by Sebastian.” 

She goes “thanks, (redacted)” and proceeds to call me by my deadname for the rest of the call. Like come on. Staff really do need training on this stuff.
TBH, I kinda just think its cool to be called sir because in FMAB when the most badass woman in the world, General Armstrong, is addressed they call her sir. Same with Hellsing where they call Integra Sir. I also don't mind dude coming from people I know aren't transphobic and I kinda see that as a gender neutral term. It's kinda the same situation with sir TBH; if I know they see me as a woman it's fine, if they're just being transphobic it's not ok. But that's me.

That being said, yeah call centers shouldn't misgender people. In all honesty they shouldn't call me at all because I don't want whatever they're selling.
I’m sorry but if you get offended by someone calling you by your first name, you have issues. ITS YOUR NAME. Only exception is it’s your dead name. Assuming you didn’t give your preferred name instead. Gendering I get, though.
[removed]
I just need to know, how the hell do you pronounce Mx?
You choose what you're offended by. They are not intentionally trying to misgender you. A simple ""actually its miss/mister"" or ""I'd prefer if you called me by my first name only thank you"" is all it needs.
Most of the time they do it because they aren’t your friend. Generally when you meet someone in a formal setting, you refer to them as Mr/Mrs <last name>. Of course context is important, but not everyone is transgender and may not have the same problem as you. Again, it’s situational context, so of course it’s upsetting in your situation, it most likely isn’t for others.

Edit: and, 99% of the time they don’t look at your first name. These people don’t know you, nor do they want to know you. They want to get their job done and go home, so they give the basic amount of respect required. I’ll be honest, being upset about this isn’t wrong, but at the same time you’re wasting your effort. They’re not likely to change for only you, unfortunately. They see your last name, hear your voice, and In the moment their brain comprehends the information and says what they feel is appropriate. Maybe they were confused, heard your voice and said “Huh, the pronoun doesn’t match the voice?” And instead change it to match your voice. You gotta remember that not everyone is around transgender people, or are familiar with how it all works. I’m all honesty they acted appropriately, if you think about it logically. Of course they misgendered you, but at the same time that isn’t really their problem. They might care less about offending you and more about getting their job done. All I’m saying is situational context is important, and not everyone cares about making you feel comfortable unfortunately. It sucks, but such is life.
If you take misgendering a random stranger they don't even know as personal, there's another issue here.
I hate being called ""sir"" ""ma'am"" ""bro"" ""boss"" . I'd rather be addressed ""Hey, slut""
I tend to really only use ma'am if it's an older woman, not so much sir. 
But also... it feels so amazing to be called sir. So there has to be a solution that makes everyone more comfortable... 
Maybe asking on the phone like ""mr, ms, or mx"" or probably starting with mr or ms because people might get confused with MX being added in, and a mx could clarify none of the above, its mx. 
Or maybe people who want to be referred to as mr ms or mx could introduce themselves as mr ms or mx namey....

Theres got to be a way to affirm both binary and non binary trans people...
Where's the petition? I'll sign in blood~
i for one am TERRIBLE with names, you tell it to me, its on my files for you, its in my notes, its not in my head! its gone! I""VE LOST IT AND I""M SORRY! but I don't tend to use ma'am or sir or mister or misses or anything either, i just generally ignore all of that sort of thing, and we talk in Mes and Yous, so hopefully you and i won't run into this problem, because frankly my dude, i don't care what gender you are, i'm here to tech support your internet TYVM.
I was on a call once and they kept switching between ""sir"" and ""ma'am"" 

Clearly couldn't decide. Neither was the correct answer, just use my gd name
The same applies to service employees who don't need to use these titles when working a drive thru
I had these same thoughts a few hours ago. I am no sir.
The company I work for is about to start adding preferred name and pronouns. Not only will it show when you call in, but will reflect on all mail sent out.

Pretty amazing change. I'll refrain from stating the company I work for....as I am unsure if it is something I'm allowed to talk about yet? I don't see why not, but I like paychecks.

I believe New York requires this for businesses, which is where our company is trialing the changes now, to roll out nationwide soon.
It's a very dangerous have it to be training your stuff to do that because it could very well take somebody out especially somebody that's just in their first couple of years of transitioning it's got to stop
I totally agree with you that they need to stop, but the only reason why I pick up the phone for unknown callers now a days is so that I can get called ""ma'am"" or ""miss"" by telemarketers. 

My voice doesn't pass very well but my ""just answered the phone, inquisitive 'hello?'"" gets me gendered right and I love it.
I am 60 years old and don't give a rolling donut what you call me during our NPC interaction. Just fix the late fee and let's get on with our lives.
Always found it weird - I am on the phone a lot with customers, and I don't think I've ever used the words Sir or Madam or whatever. And I've never been pulled up on it. Honorifics are weird, and seem really archaic to me
I used to work in a call centre and so many older women would lose their shit when they were called madam. Would always just ask if they minded me calling them by their name.
That's fair for them I suppose but a simple ""do you mind if I call you <first name> is an easy solution and have had people ask me before
As someone who called an older man mate instead of sir I can confirm that they bloody hate it
Fuck em.
I would love that! I'm still legally my birth name, but dont go it, sir, etc.
it's like mix
I got called a woman by a doctor who I told I was on T.
Welcome to Denmark where people will look at you like some weird animal in zoo if you ever use any gendered honorifics when interacting with someone (Old people are the exception)
Same.  I just call everyone by the name they give me unless I'm told otherwise.  We're both professionals, working in a professional environment.  There's no reason for us to use gendered honorifics.

Fortunately the job in question deals almost exclusively with HR and HR-adjacent people, so the overwhelming majority of them Get It.
Norway's the same. Crazy when kids in school call their teachers sir/maam instead of just their name. It creats a social barrier between the two. We're not slaves, we're all equal, so why do we put up these dumb honorifics to show social status?
Omg the more I hear about Sweden the more I want to pack up right now instead of finding a job first.
People encounter trans people, stealth trans people, and eggs all the time.
It's still a stupid and pointless way of ""showing respect"". Being called ""sir"" isn't respectful to me, quote the contrary, and the only people who do see it as a sign of respect are boomers who think that the year 1987 was the peak of human civilization.
I don’t know what school you went to, but mine certainly didn’t teach me that calling someone by their own name is rude or disrespectful.

Edit: OP also mentioned their title (Mx.) is listed in their profile the call center worker was looking at. Isn’t it unprofessional to use a different title than the one specified?
The post is about being misgendered, which will still hurt no matter how connected you are to the other person. It's very unprofessional to assume gender.
Common question! My understanding is it's prononounced the same as ""mix"". I've never actally used this is real life though... and might try to avoid it because I don't know either.
I've had this happen too. As well as the massively pregnant pause when I am trying to call about <deadname account> and I'm like ""yes, this IS <deadname"" and they can't understand why I sound like a linebacker but am telling them my name is ultra feminine.
I’ve noticed it depends on how rich they are or what kind of rich if that makes sense. When I worked at a high end cheese shop & I would get tourists I always would call the little old ladies “miss” instead of “ma’am” because they would giggle & because it was cute to them that someone treated them like they were “young” still. But good god calling old rich guy or  woman anything but sir & & ma’am they will lose their shit. 

Personally I agree & it’s one of those polite things that should be burned to the ground. I don’t want to be called sir ma’am miss or literally anything other than my fucking name. I don’t even like mx that much for myself but it’s still a hell of a lot better than miss
Iirc, Madam has always been one of those that you really shouldn't use. It's well ingrained, at least for boomer and GenX that a ""madam"" is a woman who runs a brothel, not a respectable title or what you should call someone. *Unless* it's an extremely old, *extremely* wealthy woman. Ma'am is regarded cometely differently from Madam. It's in the same class as ""Miss"", but they are different as Miss is typically for gals >25 and Ma'am is for >30.  Makes sense older ladies would be highly offended being called that. 

But really, if you've got the person's name, there's no reason not to refer to them by it. Calling someone by their name is way less offensive than accidentally calling someone the wrong pronoun. You're just setting yourself up if you use pronouns when you don't have to.
I think because they feel that it’s patronising. It’s definitely not your fault.
I waited tables/bartended through college and have spoken with many clients on the phone. It is super easy to avoid gendered language all together and I quickly became quite good at it once I focused on it and then no one was offended. 

While it is nice and affirming to be called miss, being called sir in my ""past life"" did a lot of harm and I never want to inflict that on anyone else. I also want all gender identities to be included and not forced to cope with the binary society we live in. 

I would keep in mind that many people are blissfully ignorant to the struggles of trans folks and it does not register to them in the same way as it does to us. That is in no way an excuse, but it helps to better rationalize why people do the things they do.
I didn’t know that either!

So it’s like that superman character lol
Standard estimate is 2%. 98% of the time people won't be trans.
[removed]
There's nothing unprofessional about assuming gender in a world where assuming gender has been reasonable for centuries. It may be a downer for us, but the majority of people can be more or less gendered correctly on a dime
God it has to be exhausting evaluating every interaction with random retail/service industry workers to make sure they cowtowed enough to an over-inflated ego. Why are people like this?
yeah, I never understood the whole extra politeness stuff.

I go to the mall to buy stuff, and your here to handle the transaction and maybe make me buy more stuff, as long as your not insulting me I really don't give a shit, for all I care you could just not say anything and just give me the total, and I would just pay and go, without saying a single word. and it would be just as functional.

even to my superiors, I say hello the first time I see them and when they explain something, I just nod to express interest and say ""okay"" or ""understood"" when their done, no need for anything else unless they absolutely want to talk or ask for my opinion, and we can all go back to business.
This is the most important advice about talking to women you need to learn: Women don't giggle because they're happy, they giggle when they are embarrassed and nervous.
if you call someone in America Madam you should be speaking in a heavy French accent. then it's fine lol (assuming they're a woman)
Which still means they’re encountering trans people all the time. 

I’d hope more than they encounter people who like that sir business
Have you considered that it might be different for a trans person to get misgendered than a cis one? 

Because it absolutely is.
[deleted]
Rejecting applicants for being black was also accepted for centuries. That doesn't make it ok.
No, that’s completely unprofessional, especially in contexts where it meaningfully impacts people’s health and well-being. Medical facilities don’t assume gender, increasingly gyms and other places that ask for gender will provide an option to specify whether you’re male, female, non-binary, and ask any relevant clarifications.

Idk where you live that you’re happy to live with dogshit infrastructure, but I think most of us prefer medical accuracy and actual professionalism to being an abused doormat because an employee forgot to look at the title literally provided next to someone’s name.
Idk I think it’s a hold over & romanticized version of the past for a lot of people. In their heads it’s the polite way to do things & they don’t give a damn about anyone else
Lack of empathy? I've never been involved in this (I'm privileged enough to never work in customer facing roles) but I guess it's an attempt to make yourself better by bulling someone.
Depends on where you are I'm sure.  Here in Texas, I give over the top politeness and generally expect it.  I don't mind if you just handle the business, and I have never criticized someone for casual rudeness.  

I can keep my thoughts on how you ""should""  act to myself.  I should really only be concerned if you are hurting someone or risking hurting someone.  I think we just have a culture of politeness and I don't see the harm.
Some people enjoy casual social interactions. I agree forcing people to be polite is weird but I dont think we should discourage strangers being friendly to eachother.

Well, it’s about the meaning you give to that word. 💁🏻‍♀️ 
Plus, when people are “gendered” correctly by mistake nobody oppose to it. Like it happens before, can also happen after transition. Maybe you should try and focus on other aspects and not just one freaking word. Because they weight as much as you give them meaning to.
Fuck it, new law, only use formal prefixes for meeting royalty or duels
There’s absolutely zero chance that anyone hasn’t met trans people much less gay people. It’s just too large a percent of the population.

They may not KNOW that they have, but it’s just impossible that they haven’t, unless they’ve been living in some kind of cave or science experiment.
You're blaming trans people for their feelings. That's not a good look. It might be a simple word to you, a cis person who society is built for and has never had cause to doubt who and what they are when it comes to this stuff. There's a whole lot of self-doubt and frustration and negativity we have to fight through to get to the point where we even transition.

You might as well ask why someone who needs a wheelchair needs a ramp or an elevator. 

""Well, look at all those people with working legs. You don't see them throwing a tantrum about having to use the stairs. Maybe this is why people with wheelchairs are seen badly and attacked so many times...""
I was going to say that my parents probably never have... but then I realized the error in my thinking.   heh.

There are still some pretty isolated and insular groups, but by and large I think you are correct."	s72z8d	trans	833	0.95	2022-01-18 17:36:39
Told my parents I am trans. It didn’t go as well as I hoped…	"Hi all. MTF (28yo) here. I discovered I was trans last year and have been transitioning for several months now. Finally decided to tell my parents.

They live on the other side of the country, so I did it over a phone call.

They took it about as well as you could expect from Fox-news binging boomers. They didn’t disown me or anything. But they gave off the same energy as they would if I had said I was a werewolf with 100% sincerity. 

They think I’ve been indoctrinated by left wing colleges. They think it’s a phase. Idk what else they think… needless to say they aren’t supportive. My mom wouldn’t talk to me for a few weeks, which was heartbreaking because we’ve always been close.

They told me they support and love me, but they certainly aren’t showing it. Refuse to use my new name. Continue to misgender me. 

I think my dad might vaguely be trying to gender me correctly, but he does so with she smug confidence of an old white man throwing me an amused bone. 

I think they might get better with time. I don’t know… they might cut me out of their life. My mom really doesn’t want to see me in person because of what I will look like. And I refuse to go boy mode around them just so they can pretend this isn’t happening.

Ugh. Just annoyed, frustrated, and needed to vent…"	"Im gonna be blunt and tell you what I told my father

""Dad, you either have three daughters or two children, your choice""

You're welcome
That really sucks and I'm sorry you're going through it. The good thing is that sometimes people just need some time to come around, you're safe and living your best life, and you're going to be able to move forward with your life. My parents took literally years to be accepting, and it delayed my transition incredibly. But after a super long interval (years, not months, unfortunately) they are actually super supportive and great advocates. So while it won't necessarily happen with time, it CAN happen with time. 

I wish you all the best and hope things get better for you soon. 💕
Sorry about your parents
If you think science can influence them, here's a link to a video explaining the scientific evidence of transgenderism. The whole video is good, but I put time stamp at the most poignant part.

https://youtu.be/uLcIbjgnGlQ?t=785
Literally just posted about my mom being straight transphobic to me over the phone. I feel your pain. Sorry 💓.
I hope this gets better for you. I’m sending all my positive messages!
😭 I'm in the same situation
I'm sorry.
I'll be honest, your coming out to your parents is exactly how my coming out went and yet my parents are staunch Democrats, so politics sometimes don't matter as much. I spent 18 months before coming out to the only remaining friend in my life I hadn't done so with already because he's definitely in the Tucker Carlson, Trump supporting, end of things. To the contrary, he instantly embraced me and began rethinking his entire outlook.

As for my parents, we're now a year exactly since I came out and they still misgender me and they know I hate hearing my deadname, so they've taken to constantly telling stories of old, ""And we couldn't find you at Disney so we just started calling, [deadname, deadname, DEADNAME, DEADNAME!!]"" That's how they've managed to continue to use it in an attempt to be slick. They have a gay friend who is a realtor and actually sold me my house pre-transition. They see him all the time and he reached out to me using my deadname and so I took the opportunity to say I was trans and he was like, ""Huh, your parents never use your new name."" A bit of backstory, years ago our entire family disowned one of my Uncles because he's a Skinhead (lol, even though his grandfather was black and his father mixed.) So, his daughter disowned him in her adulthood as well, but because of the original disown of my Uncle, I hadn't seen her in maybe 22 years. Recently, my family orchestrated a reunion with her. Everyone on that side of the family got to meet her again for the first time. I wasn't even told about it, my parents made up a story to her that I couldn't make it. They're obviously embarrassed of me, which hurts.

Sorry, my point was, you mentioned them sticking their heads in the sand and it struck a chord because that's exactly what mine ended up doing. Rather than confront this and learn and grow, they decided it was easier to ignore.

Still, clearly everyone is different, but I was more passive and thought, they'll get there, but if I could do over I would have been more careful in not letting them stick their heads in the sand, because at this stage, they're entrenched.
Same (i can’t transition yet tho) it sucks that that has to happen to you! I’m so so sorry! You parents are close minded and need soemone to open it for them… I send you all the love and wish you the best of days!
""They told me they support and love me, but they certainly aren’t showing it. Refuse to use my new name. Continue to misgender me.""

Ok that is normal, what has being a reality for us like for ever , for them is basically something new ( in my case about deadnaming is fighting a name that they gave me and almost 40 years of using it every time they think on me... so is not gonna happen that fast that they connect your choose name to you). To mothers is specifically difficult, so prepare to hear "" i have you in my womb... How i never noticed... take more time... slow it... I am nervous with the changes...  I gave you your name... you always gonna be my ( insert dead name), etc..., etc... note: now writing etc...  y feel like that personality of the movie ""split""), so do not expect lack of resistance... as you probably had to fight your inner transphobia to accept yourself, they have to do so to accept you, but they start with a disadvantage... for them is new... for us we always feel it... .

At least they declare they will always love you and support you...I think they need time and understanding, My first talking with my parents were mostly like yours,, but a year after, we are talking regularly and for them is not an issue  any longer.

I know what are you going trough, I did it with 39 years old and with them around the 60 years and they , as the rest of my family,  living an a very phobic and traumatised country...

Took them long to understand, but they were trying hard... my mom even went to  a psychologist to ask about me, how it works, if is something that can be ""cured"", if is something ""natural"", why she never noticed, etc...

""So do not despair now, you took it out of  your heart..."" (words of my dad that till now deadname me, cause his brain do not make the click), be very supportive of your parents... its very important... Understand this will take time, and mutual effort...

But you may get surprised how they can improve fast... they need to digest the news..,. you coming out was a heavy food for they heart.

you gonna be ok, and let Chronnos to do his work... time will heal and reunite..

you gonna be ok. believe me that. So do not feel bad about coming out...
Sorry about that.
Show me a relationship with love but without respect; then, i’ll show you a textbook, emotionally toxic relationship. We can compare notes, but i think you already know:love cannot exist without respect (and so many more emotions and actions, but respecting trans is the point in this case). You have done wonderfully to open up so intimately with your parents. I hope they grow to see you and treat you with all the love you deserve, because you deserve love.
Sorry things didn't go the way you planned mate hope it gets better for you
I'm sorry to hear. You deserve better from them. I hope in time they are able to come to terms with your identity and be supportive. For now, put yourself first.
I'm sorry. I hope they come around to the way things really are. You deserve to be you.
I went through about the same thing with my parents. Came out, they aren't accepting at all, said they still love me but treated me like shit.

I spent a year trying to fix things and convince them to accept me. It didn't work. I'm now NC and I am much happier. I'm definitely grieving about losing my relationship with my parents, but it's better this way. If they ever change then I would give them another chance, but I don't expect that to happen.

Don't spend too long trying to fix things if you don't see effort on their end, you'll just grow to resent them anyway. Move on and focus on building new relationships with people who accept you for who you are. If your parents can change to love the real you, they can do it on their own. You don't need to earn their love.
As a parent of two sons I have always supported them in everything they chose to do. I would hope that if either had realised they were trans then I would continue to support them but I’m not sure how long it would take to remember their new name, especially as I often get it wrong now 🥴. Don’t worry you’re parents just need time to adjust but they will always love you regardless of who you are or become. Much love ❤️
Well, sorry they didn’t accept things right off the bat. On the other hand, it doesn’t sound like they’re super in your life right now, so even if it hurts ok it sure it hitting your day-to-day that much. 

I might say something like this when they talk about Christmas or Thanksgiving, 

“John isn’t coming to thanksgiving or anything ever. He was this lie I told. Megan can come.  She would love to come. I would love to start being honest with you. I know you’re going to make mistakes on the pronouns and whatnot, but you have to try. I’m not messing around. I am doing this. I’m not going to lie just to be around you.  I love you and I know you don’t want me to be dishonest.”

I do think that maybe people (especially older people and parents) don’t get it and have a lot of shock initially, so try not to take it too much to heart. My mom said some less than choice things the first month or so. But she came around in about 3-6 months.
Best thing you can do? Give them years. Transition as hard as you can (or want to). Return to their lives glowing on hormones and joy. It's a really powerful message and my physical transformation from years of this really did change how my parents interact with me. I only hope yours can, too.
 I mean it’s like people don’t know history ? Trans people have existed for centuries  . It’s not a political statement
You're asking to be accepted and to not be judged, but you're not offering that in return, are you?

- Fox-news binging boomers
- smug confidence of an old white man

Are you extending the empathy you'd like to receive?
Whats wrong with being both genders, that way you get best of both worlds..boy when boy situation or how you feel comes along, & girl when you want to let your hair down...literally lol..
Just give them time it’s a lot to process. I came out to my mom (more than once) as transgender and she still doesn’t quite understand everything. I’ve given her all the resources I can and told her to do research and when she had questions to come to me and we’d talk about it. She said she’s making a list of questions and is still working on it, it’s been 4 months 😬.
So sorry that’s happening, I hope they get better. Just know that there will always be people who love and support you! ♥️
It typically doesnt go well
I’m sorry 😞
They should respect your choice to be trans. You should also respect their choice not to accept it.
I’m so sorry. I feel this, I’m 29 and haven’t come out yet for this reason. Rooting for you and hoping things get easier over time. Don’t let anyone make you feel small, friend.
I'm so sorry OP.... this is exactly why I advocate people coming out to others they're worried about through text. This way it can be added in that it's appreciated and expected that they take a minute to process the information before replying, that way there is nothing said that they'll regret. Also include that any words other than love and support will be ignored and potentially blocked if they choose a place of ignorance and hate. 

From what I've seen there's a lot of people who will be stopped in their tracks and actually take a moment to think and realize this is coming from a person they care deeply for and they deserve that love and support. Unfortunately sometimes that's not how it goes, but just makes the situation easier on our end to cut off and cut ties if needed.
I’m sorry they aren’t being supportive. I hope they get better.
Sorry for what happened to you
I'm so sorry things aren't going well with your parents. I'm proud of you for refusing to compromise on who you are though. This mother of a trans girl is sending you love ❤️
First of all! Happy Birthday 🎉 uhhhuuuuu u did it! 

If u want, I can share my experience with my mother. 

I've never had a very good relationship with her and came back into contact with her some weeks ago and observed her life and what is she thinking about people in general especially about gender norms. 

So I figured out that she wasn't or still is not that deep into the process questioning gender norms and stuff. So I just decided to drop it like ""Congratulations Miss (enter name) it's a boy!"" That's it. She said something around the lines ""its your life.."" it was not really like what I wanted or better saying what I would do when my child is coming to tell me this awesome news, but I didn't expect anything from her so (??). 

What I learned on this journey is, as I said, most people and your parents probably as well don't think about breaking gender norms. They live their life and that's it. We instead put a lot of mental, emotional, physical and spiritual work into ourself and then being trans or defining yourself as you want to be is just a natural process of working on our own identity. 

So, the perspective I want to give you is, imagine your parents are on the very very beginning to ask themselves the questions like ""who am I and who I want to be?"". You give them literally the chance to evolve their own identity, because you are the pioneer in your own family system. And that is something you can be very proud of yourself! 

Thank you for your hard work and that you came so far!
I'm sorry for you man, I'm stuck in a similar situation where I've either got a few years of just keeping it to myself or having a 50/50 of either success or fucking hell. Best wishes from over here, I really hope things work out for you
I’m very sorry 😢. But be strong. Believe in yourself 😘
you can’t expect your parents to use the correct pronouns and name from the get go. mine don’t and i pass full time. i hope yours will come around tho
Reminds me of how my parents reacted when I came out. They are somewhat accepting now but it took time and me moving out. You're already moved out so you have an advantage. Hope for acceptance but don't be afraid to stop communication if you have to.
well if this can help i join you on that! hugs*
Wow this is very similar to my parents except my mom took 6 months before she talked to me on the phone (she was afraid of my voice)

My dad told me to ""lose his number""

They say they love me but refuse to use my name or gender and they aren't even fox news watching crazies.  They are just very small town christians. 

I hope your folks come around.
I'm sorry man, same happened to me too. I'm not sure if it gets better, because it didn't for me, but it becomes semi-bearable with time i suppose. Try not to slip into a hole of self hatred though. It's nice to have your parents validation, but you don't *need* it, just remember that. I hope you have a supportive group of close friends and maybe other family you can vent to.
Stay strong and keep building yourself up with your dedication to self progression.

My situation ended in a physical altercation which I do not recommend unless that’s a world you know lots about…

Maybe it’s a blessing that they live so far away. Gives them time to think and less access to harass you.

Best of luck with your situation, we are always here to talk if you want to.
I’m in your exact boat without the benefit of distance. Once I get my locks changed I’m probably going to pre-emptively strike and cut them off.
I’m sorry to hear things haven’t gone well, but in the end it is your life and your choice. You are choosing authenticity and happiness for yourself. If your parents truly love you then they will love you for who you are, regardless of political or religious views. Stay strong and stay true!
I'm really sorry you had to go through that, but I want you to know you are worth more than their opinion and if the way they are treating you is only making you feel bad it's okay to take some time from them on your own. you can set the boundary that they need to respect your decision and if they don't then maybe it'd be better for your own mental health to cut them off? even just for a bit
I have had an extremely similar experience with my coming out.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I went through the same thing and it's so difficult.

My mother screamed at me to get out the room and my father kept telling me to hold off being an ""advocate"" and not transition and focus on education, when I eventually dropped out of university his excuse was switched to hold off on transitioning and focus on work, I funnily enough is also unemployed as I am not even mentally stable enough to hold down a job.

 I've been accused of punishing my parents, just saying it because a childhood friend of mine happened to be transgender too (I was constantly being compared against my friend whenever I made a decision because we were so similar - it was completely dismissing me). Got told I was being disrespectful for wanting to change my dead name and surname (currently only changed first name but so desperately want to change surname too, I feel trapped being associated with my family by sharing the same surname). Went through multiple periods where my mother wouldn't speak to me for 1-2 months at a time and when she does speak to me she is emotionally manipulative and abusive towards me half the time (she was also like this before I came out. never apologises for anything she does).

My younger brother tells me that our parents will love and support me if I transition, but in the 5/6 years since I've come out? They have not once shown a single ounce of support to me. I'm still deadnamed and misgendered every single day. No extended faimily outside the house knows I'm trans, it's a taboo subjet to discuss and I'm not allowed to tell any other family members, they also expect me to continue presenting as female when we do see them. 

I have BPD and struggle with severe anxiety and depression and their attitude towards me makes everything I suffer with worse and then the gender dysphoria takes a bad hold on me and they don't want to hear it and dismiss it immediately if I have been pushed into a breakdown due to them.

I'm not in a financial situation to move out yet and I need to at least have some form of relationship left with my dad at least as I will need someone to pick me up and take me home from the hospital after my top surgery which I've now had a referral for, but tbh once I am able to put myself into a financial situation to move out it'll either be low contact or non at all with my family if they don't make an effort to show support.
And my mother answered “ so I’ll have only one child : your brother “.
Ultimatums don’t always work, and I’m sad we’ve to use such a bad solution hoping they’ll accept us :(
Ugh. I’be been procrastinating exactly this. My parents are supportive but in the 7 months since coming out to them, have only deadnamed and misgendered me. Flows like water to them, no hesitation.
What did he choose?
Yeah… I think they will eventually come around… it’s just hard having to deal with them right now. They’re talking to me again now, but are essentially trying to pretend I never told them.
I like to add another great resource to explain a bit the situation... https://genderdysphoria.fyi/
That actually does go lengths in my family so thanks for the links
Sorry one question… how do you make the flags?? I want to add the trans lesbian one…. Please tell me???
Thanks for sharing, though this made me realize that I think my dad probably also still calls me his 'son' and dead-names me back home (i live abroad from home now) to people who met me prior to transition. I can't confirm that but his inclination is to automatically use my deadname out of habit, though he thankfully tries very hard to correct himself. i can see he sorta struggles with trans-identity, but mostly he was just thankful i was still in the binary and he didnt have to use neo pronouns lol

i'd like to have an honest conversation with him about  whether he respects me behind my back because despite him being very accepting of me and a good-hearted person, he's still a sixty-something year old dad with those old views.. and maybe cares too much how people will perceive him if he admitted he had a trans daughter. hes more of an arty dude than a macho sports kinda guy but toxic masculinity runs deep even in his bones lol.

i wanna ask him but .. i dont want to put him on the spot with our relationship so physically distant. it would be much easier to do if i was holding his beer hostage XD
Hello there! I'm sorry that you can't yet transition. 

However, when you do transition I wish you the best and lots of happiness!! 

Good luck darling! 😁😁

That’s exactly what my mom did too. She said she was afraid of my voice changing.
Gotta say I 100% agree with Lillith on this one. I told my family the same and ended up with one sister. No regrets. We are who we are and we shouldn't be groveling to *anyone* just to be accepted. Plus, trying to hang on will just drag on the pain for a long period of time. Better for a clean cut.
Its not an ultimatum. I see how how it sounds that way, but its not. It's informing your family that if they refuse to accept you for who you are, it is THEM who are walking away from you and not the other way around. It's a boundary.
It shows their belief, they'd rather have one child than support you, and you're better off with those kind of people out of your life
No but that is what we want. Either they accept it or they show that they are pathetic inhuman cunts who we can freely throw out of our lives
I mean… that’s the ultimatum working. You gave them a choice and they picked one of the choices. Now you can live your life feeling emotionally and physically safe. Ultimatums should never be used to coerce someone. They are the last boundary you can set with someone.
I'm really sorry about that. BUT... please don't do what I did. Please don't let it delay your self-discovery and transition by a bunch of years. Being trans doesn't go away with time; accepting yourself and living your best life is the only path forward.
On the right side panel there's a place called user flair preview. If you press the pencil icon thingy you can edit your flair for this subreddit
That's certainly understandable, I didn't realize there was such a large distance physically. I'm still 25 mins from mine. My sister had the much brighter idea of moving 6hrs away 😋.

I hope your experience is much better, I wholeheartedly believe people can surprise you. I do wish there was a book of etiquette you could give your family. Like, what trans is, what the experience might be like, educating on non-binary trans. Then, going into what is appropriate or inappropriate and such. I still haven't found a book that really does help, I ended up buying 5 books that were highly recommended that I honestly didn't read. They read one, but then went ""head in the sand"". Most were biographies, so honestly useless. Where's the ""Idiot's Guide to Transgender""?
I totally understand, i got so frustrated at times! Btw your user name is hug dealer… can I get a hug anyway?
Thank you for accurate calling out and describing a boundary in the scope of trans mental health. 💜

Not really ""I won't be friendly with people who don't accept me for who I am even if they're family"" is not an ultimatum. It's a, say it with me, boundary.
HHa I take the risk!"	uij7uw	trans	813	0.98	2022-05-04 23:09:30
Today has brought relentless harassment, misgendering and frustration. Why can’t I just live my life without others being opinionated 🥺		"you look so pretty! im sorry you had such a horrible day :( you dont deserve it
And the harassment and hate comes from deep seeded fear that if they ever actually explored there sexuality they might find they like what they say they hate. Are there in the closet still so show hate as a form of self protection so the world dose t find out there secrets. Just my opinion though. On a better note you are gorgeous
I don't understand that because you look like a very pretty woman to me, I wouldn't mistake you for a man at all...

Even though I really like your hair, longer hair can make you look more feminine and pass more easily, and I am speaking from experience. My hair is short, and while I'm waiting for it to grow, I wear a wig. So you could consider that option...
The world likes hating people who just live their lives. And probably they might don’t stop their hatred. But lemme tell you that their hate is ephemeral, not irrelevant, but one thing that also will never change is that all those words is pure lies and bullshit. While they say that you’re an aberration they lie. While they say that you are not a woman, they lie. When they say that you are not beautiful they lie. Their mouths will say nothing but lies and they will always say lies and bullshit. Because the truth is that you are wonderful, you are a woman, you are precious, YOUR existence is precious. Just look at you girl, if I saw you and heard you walking down the street my brain without any doubt would know that it’s watching a beautiful woman. Big hugs to you sister, never forget how beautiful you are
[removed]
Excuse me, miss? I have an opinion: you're really pretty!
why tf you so pretty?
You remind me of the girl that plays Jessica Jones! I had to do a double take there! Don't listen to them you are beautiful!
Unfortunately, a lot of people are jerks... But you miss, you are beautiful. ❤️ Don't let their words take that from you.
The transphobia has been spiking a lot lately, and I think it’s the political attack ads. I’ve been passing consistently for about six months, and then this past week and a half, I get someone calling me sir every day, it’s bizarre.
F em
I think you look very pretty, young lady..
Yup, people suck. I’m sorry you’re having to endure this. You are great the way you are.
I like your hair
You look awesome hunny. I hope that today/tomorrow is so much better for you. You deserve to be happy ❤️
Because you’re a woman. Society does not like women that don’t fit in the box even the ones who do fit have a hard time. It’s okay sis we are here for you
I'm sorry
You look great.  Don’t let others ruin your day!  You’re beautiful!  Own it!  😊
It's dumb cause you look gorgeous. Makeup is 100%, too. 

This is a bit gamer of me but I play FFXIV and I see a lot of player characters that look just like you. My reason for saying that is lots of people want to look like you/ look AT someone like you for hundreds of hours. They had endless possibilities but they chose your style, y'know?

Gamer moment over, fuck the haters, they're jealous that you're brave enough to give a shit about yourself.
You look great.  It’s wrong that people are dicks to you.
Girl, you look beautiful! Don’t let the haters bring you down. You’re gorgeous! ❤️🥵
You really look pretty
i 100% feel like people harass/bully you because they are jealous that they can’t fully and authentically be themselves like you so effortlessly can! your confidence makes them angry, and they project onto you. it’s so dumb. like imagine wanting to be someone so bad that you treat them like shit 😂 can’t imagine. your makeup looks amazing and your haircut is awesome! my sister always had hers like that before she passed. keep rocking on and honestly fuck the people who are being mean!
WE HAVE THE SAME TANK TOP!!
I'm sorry you had a sucky day. I hope tomorrow is way better. ❤
I wish people would just let other people be themselves.  I could never understand how someone living their own life, not bothering anyone else, hurts them in any way.
How the fuck does anyone misgender you? Man there are some really ignorant and hateful people in the world. Hugs!
Your eyes are super pretty! I hope your days are filled with blahaj and validation. But in the mean time I offer digital hugs and headpats. You look amazing and I can honestly say you are goals.
Everyone has opinions, but the only opinion that matters is yours... and, right now, mine, because I hold the opinion that you look - and are - amazing, and I'm right about it!
gorgeous pic, how would anyone misgender you?
Aw thank you 🥹 it just seemed like I was getting hate everywhere I went on top of the usually harassment I receive in this Reddit group.
I know that much for a fact... I was once a deeply transphobic person, because of my upbringing and exposure to the wrong side of media. I'm now finding that I enjoy AT LEAST dressing feminine, and definitely questioning my gender identity. I also have joined communities like this one looking to offer support 💜
Aw thank you!
I guess I just don’t understand the need to seek out individuals who’re just living there lives in their own community.
Part of me always wondered that but I mean, the shit the say just seems so heartless
I’m definitely waiting on my hair to grow but wigs wouldn’t work with my life unfortunately 😭 to much maintenance for my current situation
Thank you soo much! I try to just do my own thing but I’ve been anxiety ridden lately 🥹
Please do! They post outside the group so I can’t see them aside from my emails
Thank you so much! 🥰🥰🥰
Aw that’s sweet, thank you!🥰
Thank you!
I usually don’t take it so hard but starting at Starbucks has made me feel really insecure for some reason
Ugh, I hate that! I had a manager at Safeway who did it to me out of spite
Aw thank you! 🥰
Aw that’s really sweet! I still want ffs so I can be out in public without harassment
I like my hair too! But I need to cut my dead ends off (just can’t afford it 😭)
Today has gone a little better! Thank you!
I’ve noticed this with the recent roeVwade fiasco!
I’ll be ok, thank you though!
Thank you! I try not to but my sensitivity level is a bit higher lately
🫣 I love final fantasy and that’s so awesome that you think that! I swear that wasn’t the goal but I see it now and it makes sense cause I’ve played since I was a kid. Thank you so much!!🥰🥰🥰🥰
LMAO, I was literally just thinking this and then I went ""damn, that was nerdy, I'll keep THAT to myself"" but I appreciate that I'm not alone.
I think it’s wrong too! Thank you! 🥰
Awww thank you! I try not to let them win but sometimes I lose 🥺
Aw thank you! 🥰
Thank you so much! I put a lot of time before work into my make up 🥰
I can see that with some of these trolls but others just seem like they’re messed up I’m the head
I love this top, so far my favorite lol
I love this top!
Today has been better, Starbucks is keeping me really busy since I started this week
Seriously!!! I try my best to ignore it but somedays I’m just like”what.the.fuck is wrong with this person!”
Awww I always wonder that too like…I clearly preset female. Aside from my Adam’s apple and shadow I guess but I mean…I’m working on that part
Aw thank you! I will be happy to get ffs one day though so I can feel pretty without makeup 🥹
Aw thank you! I just wish everyone’s opinion was nice like that, or at the very least neutral lol
who’s giving you hate here?? i just want to talk
It’s good to know there is change in the world like this 🥰
Nice I was raised in sorta the same way and later started exploring my sexuality and figured out I'm Bi. Took a lot of heat and lost some close friends when I came out.
You mean by seeking you out to hurt are some one like me seeking out the bullies and phobes who think it is ok are there right to pass judgement are there sick opinion on others.
Fear of the unknown cause hatred and heartlessness. Nothing will ever change that. You can change some people's minds but for the few you change there is a whole new generation being raised to hate by there parents or the views of there piers. Sad thing is most claim to be spiritual are religious and base there views off what there they are told is right by others. Hince live your life as you see fit and not off the views and hatred of others be like a duck and let it roll off your back like water to there feathers. Smile keep your head up enjoy your life.
Your welcome! :D
It's true you ARE/AM/IS a very beautiful young woman...PERIOD!!!!! Hey I'm 67, almost EVERYONE  is young to me..
Oh that's annoying! Its still grogeous though
Yay! ☺️
*\*Quietly chanting in the background ""Tifa Cosplay, Tifa Cosplay, Tifa Cosplay\~""\**

Though I would also accept Garnet from FFIX.
Oh yeah, we all pretty much nerds here, you’re safe lol(well, kind of)
I get it, I really do. Just remember: for all the haters out there, there are just as many if not more supporters and people wanting to be by your side :)
This guy 
u/APHA-TO
Oh yeah... the friends I have are the most toxic about this kinda thing you'll ever meet. I will for sure lose them when I come out, although I'm probably going to cut them off soon anyway, because of how they behave when something involves my fiancée, and I now have my fiancée's friends who I get along with really well :)
I mean, guys like the one I’m taking about. You’re cool lol the guys that comment mean hurtful things on womens pics are just trolls 🧌
I would totally do Tifa if my hair was longer and my boobs were bigger lol but I probably do a better garnet in disc 3 😂
on it bestie 👍👍👍
Oh that's great you have someone that loves you for you and has friends accepting of it as well
Yes that they are but sry the world views are mostly fucked and made up to serve there over boosted egos. And people with big kind hearts suffer there wrath just to stroke that ego. Like I said your a beautiful woman just keep your chin up and let the haters hate.
Woman, inserts and wigs exist! x3 You can have whatever length and sizes you want. That said, I'm a sucker for IX. It got me early on as a kid and I'm always gonna have a soft spot for Garnet and Zidane.
It’s ok though..fuck that guy. He’s the bloke..😒
I put the wrong name at first
And if you ever just need someone to vent or just a kind ear to talk into message me.
ohhh okay nvm my other comment ill get to harassing some transphobes
Aw thank you 🥰
Aw my hero 🥰 just be careful cause people like that like to push people over the edge for fun.
Your very welcome 🥰
eh he cant say anything to me that will make me think im less than.
Let them push I'm always down for a good throwdown.
Usually I feel the same but he just kinda topped off my lousy day full of being misgendered and harassed irl. 😔
I’m the opposite of that lol I won’t back down but I don’t enjoy any kind of angry throw downs
aw im so sorry. if its anything to you, i dont think you look anything like a bloke. all i see is a gorgeous woman!!
It's all good we got you if you need us just say when. My demons haven't been out to hunt lately.
Aw thank you! 🥹 I needed that. It’s unfortunate that my ego feels so fragile sometimes 😣
I will! I only see the emails to these people who our rude but they’re not public to my comment section
i know the feeling. youre a real woman though and dont let any harassment you get make you feel otherwise!!
I am really hoping that Starbucks will follow through with covering my surgeries so one day I can just live a norma life without the stares, laughs, harassment and misgendering. I mean…all that happened while I was shopping with my son today
oh my goodness, im so sorry those people would do that, especially in front of your son. some people just seem to feel the need to be mean to those unlike them :(( i hope you can get your surgeries though, if theres any gofundmes i can share id be happy to
I need to start one but haven’t set one up for myself yet 😭 my son has one for his cerebral palsy but I felt like it’d be a lot harder for me to set one up wondering where I might actually post it
i have an army of 15+ trans teens on my side if you do set one up, i can get all of them to post it lol
That would be awesome! I might not be able to send it till later once I get the chance to make it though, is that ok?"	wetvjy	trans	746	0.97	2022-08-03 02:01:57
It/its	"Kinda tired of people not respecting pronouns just because it/its is dehumanizing in their opinion. Like, I get why you feel that, but I also don't care. They're my pronouns so use them. You don't get to misgender us just because you're uncomfy. Your trans experience is not universal. Thank you for coming to my TED talk. 

P.S. for some of us the dehumanization is euphoria inducing so please remember that, like you, being properly referred to makes our brains do the goodie good chemicals."	"This is coming purely from a prespective of educating myself because I haven't met someone who goes by it/it's before. 

What is the difference between it/its and they/them? Is there even a difference or is it just a personal preference thing?
Like I said in the other post like this somewhere else, I will absolutely call you it if you want me to, misgendering isn't cool, but at the same I just can't be comfortable while doing it. Feeling euphoria from dehumanization isn't something I can understand because I have trauma from that. I respect your choice of pronouns, but I absolutely don't understand it. I suppose I don't need to, but I think the high emotions on both ends of this make it hard to empathize with each other.  At least that's how I feel.
I personally don’t like it/it’s for myself as I feel it’s dehumanizing but ofc If someone else goes by them I use them it’s just respect I don’t understand what some people find so hard about it
This post feels r/voidpunk
I’m seeing a lot of people who don’t use they/them labeling it as a gendered term. It isn’t; I’d never misgender someone who uses it/it’s pronouns but some of the rhetoric that is used to contextualize it (not the pronouns themselves) feels disrespectful toward a lot of trans/nb people. I use they/them, and if someone were to tell me that’s gendered, I’d say they were severely misguided and should not tell me what or what I don’t identify with. I respect your pronouns and would never shit on you because of them, but I think a wider discussion needs to be had about what separates they/them and it/it’s.
I swear with as much as I have studied trans folks. Grant it more mtf as that is me. But I am trying to learn and understand all of the different variations of humans. But it seems that I will always be learning and dont think I will ever comprehend it all. Which is maddening because I should be able to for fucks sake. 
But one thing I have learned is that logicically I do not comprehend a lot of things it is that pronouns for people are extremely important so if the thing wants to be called it/its then fuck it I may slip up but it/its shall it be. 
I hope this makes sense. My asd/adhd brain is trying to word things so I dont use anything incorrectly and offend anyone/anything. 
Yall have a blessed day!
Question about people with it/its.

Do you consider yourself objects? Because I figured people who dont identify with any gender would also be using they/them. Please explain?
I will call anyone generally any pronoun unless it's an obvious troll or racist or something. But I understand how many transgender people might find using it/its deeply upsetting to use on a person
The problem is that ""it"" has a history of being a transphobic slur. Being a pronoun doesn't erase that history.

And like any other slur, we have the right to reclaim it and defang it. But with any slur, many members of the community may not be willing to use it, even though other people identify with it.

For example, if someone identifies with the word ""Tranny"", I'm not going to tell them not to use it. It's a slur that they get to reclaim on their own terms, irrelevant of how other people feel about it.  But at the same time, that slur still has teeth, it still hurts people, and I'm not comfortable using it, because it is still a slur that hasn't been fully reclaimed. They can call themselves a tranny if they like, but I'm not going to use that term for them. 

It falls in to the same boat. If someone was to call me ""it"" they aren't just misgendering me, they are using a slur designed to hurt and dehumanise me, just like someone call me a tranny is using a slur to hurt me, even though other trans people self identify with the word.  ""It"" can and does hurt people, and that makes it different to most other pronouns.  I don't know what the right answer is, but I struggle to use a slur that is still used to hurt us
It's got a point, you know
Howdy there. I wanna start by saying I support your pronouns and actively respect them. I just wanted to get your perspective on this specific query, as I’m not personally acquainted with any people who use it/its. In the event that an individual has been traumatized or dehumanized in their personal life by being degraded through the use of language such as being referred to as it and is not comfortable using that specific language, how would one approach this situation? My instinct would be to recommend the avoidance of pronouns in reference to it, not to misgender it. I understand that it’s not an ideal situation, and likely a rare occurrence but I’ve been curious about this for some time.

Edit: added words for clarity
I will try to respect the pronouns of people who use it/it’s but I will also ask if they are ok with me using other pronouns because it’s very uncomfortable for me since it/it’s has been used to dehumanise groups that I am apart of. Some people no matter how hard they try will never be able to fully work through their trauma and be able to use it/it’s without distress. I wish there was another pronoun that had the same or similar meaning to it/it’s that could be used instead and didn’t have all of the negative connotations that it/it’s pronouns being used to refer to a person carry. While I agree that people who use it/its should have their identities respected, people with trauma regarding it/its pronouns should also be respected as those pronouns can be distressing for them. I will never be able to understand why someone would want to be dehumanised, which essentially means to be treated as less than human.
My best friend said he would go by it/its if he thought anyone would take it seriously. He’s super goth and considers himself a “genderless void” and doesn’t at all feel attached to the concept of the binary. 

I arguably should be using it/its here, tbh.
While I feel using it is dehumanizing, I'll do it regardless, for the simple fact that *it's not about me*

Your gender and pronouns are yours and I will always respect that.
Been waiting for someone to say this ever since I saw someone ranting about it the other day. Just respect people's pronouns whatever they are. Basic respect shouldnt be difficult
I would say it's more dehumanizing to decide that someone else's identity is up for debate. Your pronouns are yours, and even if they were supercalifragilisticexpialidocious/supercalifragilisticexpialidocems, that's still on the rest of us to adapt to XD
I'm having the opposite problem. This one person have started referring to me as it/it's instead of they/them it's ""grammatically incorrect""
I would never shit on anyone who uses it/its but it makes me uncomfortable enough that I would actively try to avoid situations where I had to refer to someone as “it” or atleast that’s my current relations with it idk maybe it’ll change with time but degrading ppl for their comfortability kinds invades mine
I feel this is a two-way street. You demand we call you it/it's to make you comfortable, but it makes us uncomfortable. It seems kind of hypocritical to demand we not make you uncomfortable, while also making us uncomfortable. I think a good solution would be to just say your name. Don't even use pronouns. Just say your name. Simple and easy. Avoids anyone being uncomfortable.

Edit: before it happens, this is in no way meant to be attacking in any form. Simply a different perspective.
Only 84% upvote do be showing how tiring it is yeah, being weirded out is just an old arguement against minorities not a based one.
Too many people try to impose *their personal* comfort and identity onto others. They take their triggers, their sources of euphoria/dysphoria, and their sense of identity and project it outward onto the rest of the trans community. If they're not personally comfy being called X, or wearing X, or presenting X way in public, then it's bad for other people to do those things.

It's honestly a really toxic attitude and it's way, waaaay too pervasive in the trans community. It leads to butch trans ladies and trans tomboys (and transmasc femboys) getting bullied. It leads to enby erasure and truscum attitudes. It leads to terms like 'transbian' being treated as slurs, despite being terms made for trans folk by trans folk.

People need to get over themselves. Respect. Other. Folks.Respect their pronouns. Respect their gender presentation. Respect their identities.

If OP wants it's pronouns to be (it/it's)—then that's what it should get.
Someone using it/its pronouns doesn't hurt anyone.

Someone not respecting someone's pronouns (or worse: mocking it) does hurt someone.

Not understanding someone's identity/pronouns isn't a reason to be disrespectful. This goes for it/its and any other unconventional pronouns
Yeah no. I won’t use pronouns that have been used against me and my ancestors and is grossly racist and dehumanizing.
Why don't you just use they/them
 ""I don't care that you're uncomfortable. I don't want to be uncomfortable and my comfort means more."" You're literally an entitled brat. Respect is a two way street.
100% agree that people should be able to use the pronouns they are most comfortable with.   


The issue I've personally had with it/its is that both of my experiences meeting someone who went by them were a case of them trying to involve other people in their kink without consent. They got off on the dehumanizing aspect, and so in kink communities would insist that their pronouns were it/its, while not really having that preference in other areas of their life.  


Unfortunately, it's not easy to differentiate between someone having those preferences or insisting on it in bad faith. So naturally, I'll use those pronouns to refer to people when they ask me to.  


But, involving someone in your kink without their consent is despicable. So, for people out there doing that: You're totally despicable and hurting people who sincerely are just trying to be comfortable.
yep. people at my school call me an ""it"" all the fucking time, even though I've never asked anyone to. they won't call me she or they but they'll call me it and a freak without skipping a beat. it literally takes more work to refer to me as that than it is to use my actual pronouns. I don't have a problem with calling someone an ""it"" if that's what they prefer, but its not right to do it blatantly when someone asks you to stop.
Just another it/it's user jumping in, explaining my perspective to maybe help someone understand why some of us might choose these pronouns (obviously that's different for everyone, so my experience isn't universal, but it seems like many people using it/it's do relate to some things I'm about to say). This is basically just a collection of reasons that play into it for me and some stuff I've been told by others 

1) No gender at all. As an agender person, I mostly don't feel any connection to gender at all, which can be different to not feeling connected to binary genders but another gender under the non-binary umbrella (agender can fall under that umbrella, but doesn't necessarily). This can mean that they/them for example still feels connected to gender - not binary gender, but the overall concept of gender 

2) It's not just about gender. There can be so many other things playing into what pronouns you feel comfortable with. Neurodiversities, like autism and adhd, trauma, dissociative disorders to name a few. That's the case for me for example. I'm autistic, have adhd and a dissociative disorder, meaning I have a constant feeling of depersonalisation (feeling disconnected from my body) and derealisation (feeling disconnected from the world around me). 

3) Wanting and feeling comfortable with dehumanisation. This plays together with 1) and especially 2) for me. Basically I do not feel human for a combination of reasons:

3a) Autism (and adhd). Being autistic (and having adhd) for me means a constant feeling of disconnection from humanity, as I have trouble understanding most unwritten social rules (including gender btw, so it's probably kinda playing into 1) too) and how neurotypical people (people who don't have any neurodiversities, so basically those that are viewed as ""normal"" by society) act, what their motivations are etc. It makes me feel like some kind of outcast, the weirdo that just doesn't fit in, not matter what I try - as if I'm just not completely human and therefore don't understand why humans do certain things the way they do them (or at all). It also means some kind of disconnection to my body. It's very hard for me to tell signs of my body needing things, like hunger, thirst or needing to pee. I oftentimes just realise I'm hungry when I'm pretty much starving and my stomach hurts like shit out of nowhere. I honestly don't know if I even really know what thirst feels like, making me constantly forget drinking and drinking way too much at once once I do drink, because my body then tries to compensate being dried out. This disconnection to my own damn body kinda makes it feel like its not actually my body 

3b) Dissociation. Because the disconnection due to autism and adhd isn't enough. I have a constant base feeling of dissociation, both deralisation and depersonalisation. It makes me experience my whole existence as if its an advanced VR game. I perceive my body the same way I perceive video game characters I play: I know its me, as in ""I can move this body around and use it to interact with the world around me"", but I don't feel a this is *me* connection. When I look down and see my body, or I look in the mirror, that body feels as familiar, as the body of another person I look at. I don't feel any more connection to it as I feel a connection with the body of my partner or friends, it's just some body, but for some reason that's the one I can move around and look through its eyes. All this makes me feel like one of these alien species that inhabit a human body to use that as disguise, so they can pretend to be human. This is not *my* body, its just one I'm stuck in to get around in this world. I just got stuffed in this thing and now I'm stuck in this flesh prison and have make the best out of it. Best thing is that sometimes I can even feel this body not fitting comfortably. Imagine being stuck in a neoprene suit one or two sizes too small and you know what this body feels like sometimes. It also sometimes feels as if this body is rejecting me and trying to ge me out of it. All this obviously also doesn't make me feel human at fucking all, so I don't like being referred to as human, but rather just as some unknown creature (and usually they're referred to as it/it's)

4) Non-native English speaker that doesn't have neutral pronouns in their native language. I'm German. In German we have three sets of pronouns to refer to people: ""er/ihm"" (he/him), ""sie/ihr"" (she/her) and ""es/ihm"" (it/it's). We do not have a default neutral besides it/it's, which is considered objectifying (ironically it's used to refer to children and animals tho, so guess children and animals are objects). In this language we don't have much choice other than a) use gendered pronouns that feel okay/the least uncomfortable , b) use they/them (done by lots of people, can be a bit bumpy in terms of grammar) c) use ""dey/dem"", a more German version of they/them d) use any set of neopronouns or e) use it/it's. Options b - d might not be chosen by people as it can be a giant struggle to have people actually respect and use them, as they're ""so much to learn and adapt and it's so weird"" (not my opinion bit what many (cis) people think). And some just prefer using the same set of pronouns in different languages, just translated ofc, so if it/it's is the best choice in their native language, it's naturally gonna be it/it's in English as well then

5) Reclaiming it. 

5a) Reclaiming from assholes. Some people have been called it by others as invalidation and dehumanisation and try to reclaim it and find pride in using it, to take away the power from those trying to use it in a negative way.

5b) Reclaiming it to win a neutral form in some languages. As explained before, not all languages have a neutral set of pronouns like they/them in English, so some people try to just make use of the neutral form that does exist and take away the dehumanising aspect from it, rather than trying to introduce new pronouns to the language (not that that is a bad thing), as its technically easier to explain to people as they do know how to use them already and just aren't used to doing it for other people

6) DID or OSDD systems with non-human alters. Disclaimer: I do not personally experience this, so I'm just repeating what I've learned from other people who do. For those that do not know about DID or OSDD, both are dissociative disorders that develop in childhood through repeated trauma, as a way to protect the child, basically causing alters (commonly referred to as ""identities"", which isn't exactly right tho) to develop (has something to do with the brain not developing the way it usually would, please read into it yourself, I am not knowledgeable enough on this to properly explain the details). Some alters might not be human, as they're meant to keep the child (mentally) safe in an unsafe situation, so the brain might find non-human beings to be the safest and best protection. And some of these non-human alters simply prefer the set of pronouns that is commonly understood as not used for humans. (second disclaimer in this: if I worded anything wrong regarding this, please let me know, as mentioned I'm not experiencing this myself and I'm still learning in the topic, but I feel like it's important to be mentioned to spread awareness, as many people still have huge misconceptions about DID and OSDD, including that non-human alters do not exist, which just isn't true)
yeah! it makes no sense for someone to say “i wont call you an it because thats dehumanizing” especially if they want to be called it, your opinion on what pronouns someone uses is meaningless imo, no one is asking you to use them yourself
my s/o uses it/its pronouns, and it's so frustrating to see how people will default to they/them even after it has told them its pronouns. absolutely breaks my heart
Op is right! As a person who also uses it/its, those pronouns are the most comfortable for us just respect its pronouns and move on. It's not asking you to kill it or anything😒
It is dehumanizing in my view. You are not a thing/object. You are a person and deserve to be respected.
I think it/its users are badass, it's kind of metal in a way to be like ""fuck that, I'm an it, an entity of admiration and fear, a manifestation of awesome"" I have a friend who uses those pronouns and I've been forcing myself to be more comfortable respecting it's wishes when I talk about it to strangers or my family, idk theres alot of bad ass ways people present qs nonbinary or experience their nonbinary gender
Hell yeah. I just wish people were better tbh. It/it's are perfectly valid pronouns and if that's what you like then idk why some people in the trans community can't handle that. Just cause they aren't for me doesn't mean that someone else can't use them.
[removed]
agreed. even if one thinks that another person's pronouns are odd in some way, this is no reason to not use them. it's an issue of respect.
wish people would understand that just because it makes YOU uncomfortable doesnt mean it makes other people uncomfortable. i dont use it/its, and when i first learned about it i was super icked out by it, mostly because of the transphobic use of it, but then i sat down and had a long thought about why should someone else's happiness make me uncomfortable when they arnt hurting anyone? and that day forward its never made me uncomfortable.

i wish more people would sit down and have that conversation with themselves.
It/its pronouns are just as wonderful as every other pronoun out there. 💖
yes ty for talking ab this /gen
Op is an absolutely an exceptional [human] and I hope it will have a nice day
yeah my secondary pronouns are it/its, and i hear this a lot
I guess the counter to this that I have heard a lot is ' Yes they are your pronouns, but I don't see why I should reframe entire definitions because you're uncomfy'.
I dont care what you identify as but i never refer to u as that b  that signifies you are less than human euphoria or not that's what u are and won't dehumanize a fellow human being
[removed]
Yes, im too scared to tell my friends, well not scared exactly. I feel like their reaction would be negative.
One agrees with this! ESPECIALLY with the dehumanisation; as one isn't a human! One uses It/Its too.

[EDIT]: One meant no harm with this, and wishes to apologise. However, we should respect others' pronouns. More often than not, many have more than one pronoun set. If you're uncomfy using one set, you can always use the other!

As for the dehumanisation, one apologises. One is a bit confused as to why it is wrong IF the person WANTS to be dehumanised via it/its pronouns. One (personally) wants to be dehumanised. Why? Because one is otherkin; not a human. Unless, one is misunderstanding the meaning of dehumanisation? One isn't the best with understanding vocabulary sometimes.

One is super sorry if one misunderstood, and would like to be educated if possible.
[removed]
it took some getting used to for me, but I never didn't use it/its for somebody because it made me feel uncomfortable

*now I'm considering using it/its lol*
Holy shit same. I use it/it's and most people just use he or they pronouns. Like I don't mind but it's annoying cause I know it's just an excuse so they don't have to actually try and use my pronouns
Its only dehumanising if you're using it towards someone who doesnt use them in a derogatory way!! It/its is valid as hell!
Like, I am libra masculine. Hearing people call me a man, he/him all the time is kind of sad tbh.

It/its just embraces my other part of myself that is, no gender.
Hey OP, I wouldn’t mind using it/it's pronouns on you. In fact I could care less that I use those on you, all that really matters to me is that you feel happy and comfortable. I have a question, if a person does not want to use it/it's pronouns on you, will be okay with having them use they/them? Also, how would you feel if that person just replaced your pronouns with your name? For example:

Instead of
""Oh, that jacket is it's over there. Op said it was looking for it's Jacket""
They do
""Oh, that jacket is OP's over there. Op said it was looking for the Jacket""
When people slip up, I understand that (feels stupid since I'm the one who should be offended, but I almost go out of my way to make sure they know it's okay) but I will never understand people who just choose to ignore someone's wishes. 
""They don't understand"" is not a good enough excuse. I personally don't understand why someone would prefer it/it's pronouns, but I would do my best to use them because I still respect the individual and that we don't have the same experiences.
Someone actively choosing not to refer to someone by it/it's pronouns if they know it prefers that, is the same as not using he/him pronouns for a trans person who wants that, imo. ""It's dehumanizing"" or ""it's inaccurate"". 
The only difference is I think people who use it/it's pronouns are mispronouned (?) Way more than us who use he/him or she/her, probably even they/them.
You do you. I dont get why people have problems with any pronouns tbh. All I know is that I had to switch from he/him to she/her in order to not die, and if u need it/it's to not die or someone else needs like bean/peanuts to not die then I'll happily use those pronouns without any questions. Like gender expressions are so vast that I find it hard to imagine that three sets of pronouns can cover them all.

Edit: From reading your comments, are you sure these are the right pronouns for you? By the sound of it you have a lot of trauma and it really shouldn't get mixed up with gender expression. Do you have contact with a psychologist to talk about these things with?
Exactly, like, it makes me uncomfortable to use she/her for people or to refer to them as women (because of personal trauma) but is that a reason to misgender them????? NO
Fr people sometimes don't understand that nonbinary is a gender and that it's not the lack of gender. Agender is. It/itself is the least gendered pronouns and they make me have euphoria. I have other pronouns i just prefer it/itself because they/them and he/him feel like nothing and being called ""it"" is more affirming
I will definitely use those pronouns, tbh I am kinda afraid that people will think I’m being a cunt for calling somebody it/it’s without context because most people find it dehumanising and I would sound like a horrible person to them. 
But I still would
yessss. I use it/he/they pronouns, and I've started to just not mention that it/its are my favorites. even my trans friends either feel it as 'having to go out of their way' or 'dehumanizing'. even when they do respect it, it's just never used. it's really frustrating.
I'll try my best to remember that and respect it, but you have to realise that for some being called an ""it"" and dehumanised as if I'm lesser, that I'm not real, that I'm just an object that doesn't deserve respect, a mockery, an abomination.... That is traumatic. If you prefer to be called that, I'll respect your wish, but you have to realise that I have my own very real traumas related to it and that I can't feel comfortable about it and that it can cause me flashbacks of literally being assaulted, beaten, and being called slurs because of my gender identity. Misgendering someone is never good and it cannot be excused but it's not ""just because I'm uncomfy"" it's much deeper than that. But I guess you don't care about that.
i don't really feel comfortable doing that unless the other person feels comfortable with it

then I'll totally do that
[removed]
Hard agree. I am one of the people who uses it/its and while I have other pronoun sets that I use, sometimes that is the only thing that feels right. It can be dehumanizing for some people, however, it is not an excuse to deliberately misgender someone. If someone truly has issues with using it for someone then don't use any pronouns for that person - use its name or any other indicator. For many people who use it/its including several people I know and myself, it is a form of reclamation and ownership of things that have been used to hurt us. But even if it ISNT that... no one else gets to decide what to call someone. Ever. I totally agree that some random person's experience is not universal and it is overall much more damaging to tell someone ""I'm going to misgender you because my opinion trumps your identity"" than it is to just find an alternative. IF it is harmful, genuinely, find an alternative. But do not deliberately misgender someone ever for any reason. Correct gendering suddenly becomes a privilege that only ""good, normal"" people get to have instead of a right. 

Obviously this is not directed at you OP - more at the people in the comments who are being boneheaded and refusing to respect people in the same way they want respect.
[removed]
I love reddit
My rule of thumb is that I'll use whatever pronouns people want even if it makes me uncomfortable. It/it's feels almost derogatory but if that's what you prefer I won't judge.
We as trans people don’t need to understand each other. With the claim that gender is outside a binary and incredibly diverse, we need to understand that every person‘s experience with gender can be unique. Usually, we can relate to one another by the fact that we don’t conform to expectations of gender when we were born but that is it. You can think how many cis people will never understand trans people‘s identities and it is kind of inevitable. In the same way a White person will never understand the Black experience or an Enabled person will never understand being disabled. What matters is that we **understand our needs, wants and complains.**
Wtf idno watts Gannon on 1st I was lmfao now I'm like wtf Wats a pronoun 👁️ I forgot haw ta spell ,omg must go kcab to skool hahaha e by gum ,Melvin's & Sheldon's may not apply 🤟katanga
Your desire to learn about this is greatly appreciated. The difference for some of us is just personal preference. I cannot speak for all it/its users, but for me specifically I just don't vibe with they/them. To me they/them just feels too gendered and attached to the nb specterum and as an agender individual who falls outside the nb space (but not I'm the umbrella term sense.) that's not an accurate way to describe me. It/it's on the other hand feels very detatched from gender entirely. I'm not any gender I'm a thing, an entity devoid of gender. And those pronouns feel right to me. There are many reasons that others prefer one over the other but in the end that preference should be respected like all people's identities.

Edited to fix spelling and grammar.
ig its more of a personal preference, when i realised I like it/its it was because a friend of mine made me laugh and fall, then said ""i broke it"" which just sent euphoria i wasn't expecting
neat vibe
I have only met a demigirl and something that had it/its as pronouns. I don't know the demigirl well (and also they have ""they"" as their primary and ""she"" as secondary, so technically not ""it/its""), but I know the other.

It goes by it/its, because (I *believe*) it wanted to be identified as some*thing*, and not someone. This is because it wanted to have a robot body. I know this concept as transhumanism, but I don't know too much about the topic other than [r/transtrans](https://www.reddit.com/r/transtrans).

Otherwise, for non transhumanists, I personally don't understand why someone would go by it/its. Would love to learn though.
I primarily use they/them but I have felt spikes of happiness when sentence structure or misspeaking leads to me being called ‘it’ unintentionally. I don’t know why it feels good, it just does. It took me at least a year to get used to the idea of being called they. This was a long time ago, there was a lot of anti-singular they discourse and most nonbinary people I knew used neopronouns, so I did as well. They/them is a gender neutral pronoun - it doesn’t provide any information about the person’s gender (although now it is more common, people outside the community are tending to see nonbinary and they/them use as a third gender bucket rather than the expansive anything else that it is). Sure it’s accurate for me, but it’s technically accurate for anyone. The neopronoun I use and ‘it’ both feel more specifically referential to me. These pronouns explicitly are for me vs they/them being for anyone by default.

All of that said when telling people what pronoun to use for me I just use they/them and tend to go with the flow.
I use all pronouns but I am very fond of it/it's pronouns. For me it is a radical stance, it's a reclaimation, it makes people think.
All we can ask is that you respect us as we respect you. I understand that the dehumanization is not an easy thing to look past. For me part of why I use these pronouns is to reclaim them due to trauma. I know it's not something everyone can do and I only hope that the efforts to reclaim them help to remove the power from those who oppress us and prevent more people from being subjected to that trauma. I hope this topic hasn't been too stressful for you and regardless if it has I apologize for it.
This is basically how I feel about it.  I’ve had “it” spat at me as a slur before so like.  if those are your pronouns I’ll respect them.  you are not me and your needs beat my discomfort. I’m not going to lie though: I will go out if my way to avoid using pronouns with you because those pronouns make me so uncomfortable.

If it makes you feel better though, you are not the first person I’ve known who used it/it’s.
It's ok to not understand. Gender and the lack thereof is strange and vast and no one should be expected to fully understand, only to listen and respect the identities of those around them.
How is punk involved with this, there is no anarchy and epic mohawks
I absolutely agree and I don't mean to force any sort of identity into you or other nb people. To do so would be counter to what I and other it/its users want. To have our identities respected. You're absolutely right that this needs to be discussed in greater detail throughout the whole of the trans community. Unfortunately many aspects of gender and the lack thereof are often subjective and differ from person to person. Like the subtle distinctions between (bi/pan/omni/poly)sexual the distinctions matter to many that hold those labels. To me both they/them and it/its are valid neutral pronoun sets but the way that they're neutral matters so some people. I personally vibe with it/its because there's a difference between my agender id and other nb ids and I personally feel those fit who I am better. I hope that makes sense and I agree that people need to be mindful of how they say things just as much as what they say. I hope you can have a lovely rest of your day friend and thank you.
Your efforts do not go unnoticed to those you interact with. Gender and the lack thereof is strange and vast and no one can fault you for not having a full understanding of all its aspects. The important thing is that you are trying too be as respectful as you can of those around you and that is all anyone can ask of you. I do hope you have a lovely day friend!

Edited to fix spelling.
Some of us do yeah. Others just feel that they/them it's often used by other nb identities and that makes that set of pronouns feel a little too gendered for us so our alternatives are it/its or neopronouns that have their own series of complex nuances and are even less accepted than even it/its and often times mocked for being too weird. Both they/them and it/its are neutral but in some different ways that differ from person to person. Personally I don't vibe with they/them.
You make very important and valid points, but for those cases where using my pronouns would be harmful to you please just use my name. Will it sound strange in conversation? Yes absolutely! But it'll spare you the trigger and bad taste in your mouth and spare me the misgendering. Some of us don't only use it/its and simply asking if there's something else you can use goes a long way. It conveys your discomfort but also shows you don't want to be disrespectful to me either and from there we can come to a middle ground. There's no universal rule of thumb for human interaction and like any relationship, however casual, communication is key.
This is honestly how I feel about it too... not to mention all of the other groups who have a specific relationship with the word ""it"". I've read about neurodivergent people who have had that unfortunate experience being called ""it""... and I'm sure it has been used in racist and misogynistic rhetoric as well. To me it isn't far enough removed from the idea of someone using ger/nig as pronouns to mock Black people or a person making an argument in bad faith to respect obviously problematic neopronouns like Oli London.

The conversation in this subreddit is always lead into a direction of ""RESPECT ALL PRONOUNS"" but I feel like the conversation is a bit more nuanced than that... and you can't tell who is arguing for certain pronouns in good faith or not.
Hello! This is a very difficult topic and I'll preface this that I'm not any singular authority on this. Any interaction must be looked at case by case as there can never be a rule of thumb with how unique everyone's experiences are. For those who are traumatized by the derogatory use of those pronouns I would strongly suggest that they simply keep their distance from people like me. It keeps them from unnecessary harm and I get to be who I am just like any other gnc person in this community. I would never want my identity to be the cause of a victims distress but it's not solely my responsibility to keep that from happening and it's still the victims responsibility to seek help with their trauma if they are able and to curate their environment into one that isn't actively harming them. People like me only wish to be respected by those who are able to do so. I do not blame those who are victims of trauma for not understanding why people would want to be called something that hurt them so much. If contact is unavoidable then perhaps only using names will suffice until the interaction is over. I do know there are people (myself included) that are reclaiming these pronouns and that effort should be commended as reclamation takes power from those who would oppress and harm us with their words.
I hope this all makes sense and I do encourage you to seek the input of others like me so that my experience is not the only you've encountered.

Thank you for your incredibly important question and I hope you have a wonderful day.
You're absolutely right. Many it/its users are not lost on the fact that those words have been and are still actively used to hurt people and those people have ever right to avoid the use of those words. I personally will not be upset if you need to use my name every time you refer to me. Will it sound weird? Probably! But that's better than both of us being upset because we forced ourselves or each other to interact in a way that was harmful to both of us. My identity is not an excuse to ignore the very real trauma if other groups just as much as their trauma is not an excuse to police the good faith self identification of others. I hope my wording makes sense and I would like to apologize for the fact that this topic has caused you and others distress.
Sie/Hir or They/Them, and I absolutely vibe with this. I have a few It/Its friends and I absolutely use their pronouns, but I can't bring myself to ask for it myself. Heck, in most cases I won't try and push for sie either, even though I do prefer that to they.
yeah, people on here don't seem to be getting that.
No you're right respect is a both ways kind of thing and the original post has a lot of obvious frustration baked into it. I'm not unreasonable, and if just using my name constantly saves myself and the other person(s) a lot of grief than who am I do say they can't do that?
Okay, here’s where the ‘it doesn’t hurt anyone’ argument breaks down for me. 

I have trauma around the word it. Like, diagnosed. I met someone who used it, and only that pronoun, and every time I was made to use it, I kept flashing back to that situation. Like to the point where I’d start dissociating. I ended up leaving that job just to escape that person because that person was triggering me so much. 

‘It’ absolutely can hurt people. A lot of lgbt people, abuse victims, and gnc people have been called an it, I know I’m not the only one who is triggered by these pronouns.
Seconded, not all ideas are equal and this is a bad idea we shouldn’t support in the name of  anything goes. This shit is detrimental to our people. No to this bullshit.
Wrong binary pronouns have always been used against trans people as weapons, but that doesn't mean I'm not gonna call a trans woman ""she"" just because others have used it to refer to trans men.
You choose to make others uncomfortable for your own comfort.
Your trauma is valid and deserves to be respected. These pronouns have been used to the detriment of many people and cultures and while I may not be able to fully understand the impact it's had on every one. I know what effect it's had on me and people like me. My individual identity is flexible and I know many like me would never wish our preferred pronouns to harm others. You do not have to only use pronouns to refer to people like me. Names exist for a reason and if it's a sufficient compromise to get through interactions then good. I would like to apologize for the fact that this topic has cause you distress and I do hope you have a good day.

I personally just do not like being referred to with that set of pronouns. Some people have other more nuanced reasons for using it/its. There's a very good reply to this post that goes into a lot of various reasons why someone might choose this specific set of pronouns instead of another set that's considered gender neutral.
There's a lot of frustration baked into my original post. You are correct that respect is a two way street and if you took just a moment to see some of the conversations I've had in the replies you'll see I'm not a wholly unreasonable person that is capable of compromise with others, much less a brat. Gender and the lack thereof is very nuanced and to simply jump into the replies to call people entitled for airing genuine grievances is hardly constructive. I do hope you have a lovely day friend.
You're absolutely correct! I personally have never witnessed this occur, but that doesn't mean it hasn't happened. Kink of any sort absolutely requires consent of everyone involved no matter the kink. Anyone who would try to use the pronouns of myself and many others just to bypass getting consent are despicable, and not only hurt those they try to force their kink onto but also harm both people like me trying to just be our genuine selves and any who would aid the reclamation effort to take the negative impact out of this pronoun set.
Exactly! This is wonderfully worded and even brings up some reasons that even I myself had not thought to consider. Thank you friend!
There is the argument to be made for those who have been traumatized and those victims should not be ignored, but we can help those victims and respect it/it's users at the same time. It doesn't have to be one or the other.
Do let your partner know that a stranger on the internet thinks it's valid and that I hope it and you have a wonderful day.
I'm sorry that you went through that, but that is no excuse to reduce my identity and the identity of those like me to a fetish. If you can't respect our gender like we would respect yours then maybe you'd be better off not interacting with us rather than activily belittling us for wanting to be respected in a community we belong in. No one is forcing you to be around us and it cost 0.00 to just respectfully not interact with us if you can't bring yourself to use those pronouns. I hope you are able to process your trauma and I'm sorry that this topic caused you distress.
Wow, ""it's just your fetish not your gender"", I'm sure that's an argument that's never been made by transphobes to invalidate our identities
My gamer, this is literally a repurposed transphobe talking point.
Or maybe some of us are autistic and don’t experience gender/lack of gender like everyone else. Your experience isn’t the same as ours. You don’t get to choose our identities, just like we don’t get to choose yours. You seeing us as sexual deviants just because of the pronouns that we identify with is your own problem you need to work on and it makes you no better than any other transphobe.
It makes me uncomfortable because being called an it has been used to attack me many times and I want no part of that ever being ""reclaimed""
Your experience is not universal. If you can't call people like me by our preferred pronouns then just use names. It isn't hard. But you do not have the right to police the identity of someone else and even less of a right to reduce that identity to a fetish. I emplore you to do some research on agender and gnc identities as all of us impacted by the derogatory use of these pronouns at the very least have the right to reclaim them just like a slur. If one group does not wish to reclaim something it does not exclude another impacted group from choosing to do so.
All we want is to have our identities respected and not thrown under the bus by the community we're a part of and we do not deserve to have that community subject us to the rhetoric that those who have oppressed us have used on the community as a whole. I'm sorry that this topic has caused you distress and hope the rest of your day is at least somewhat enjoyable.
You're literally using transphobic rhetoric here...
How about *not* policing how other people do gender, hm?
>I'm not calling a human being an ""it"".

Then kindly get off this sub. We don't do truscum gatekeeping crap here.
Non-binary is very much not a gender?? Non-binary is a term defined by what it's not, i.e. not binary. It is a descriptor of gender, yes, but in it of itself it is not a gender (unless someone is personally describing themselves that way).
Nonbinary is not a gender. It’s an active opposition to the colonial idea of gender itself.
I'm sorry you feel that way friend. All I'll say is if this was a troll post I don't think I'd be having genuinely constructive conversations in the replies with multiple people who both do and don't share aspects of my identity. I do hope you take some time to look into the experiences of agender individuals. A good place to start might be a reply by another user to this very post that lists a few very well worded reasons why people prefer to use it/its pronouns. Lastly perhaps there are similarities in the arguments because I'm genuinely frustrated with being misgendered like anyone would be. I hope you are able to enjoy the rest of your day.

That's really interesting. Thank you for sharing 😁
I've seen entities devoid of gender on shrooms and use it/it's for them so I can respect that. I didn't see it as disrespectful as much as just not anthropomorphizing it

Maybe that's super weird but it helps me a lot to look at it that way, like I use it/it's but I don't have any disrespect for them all
Thank you for the good explanation. I was hesitant to use but this makes a lot of sense. 

My issues had been when I've heard neo pronouns it was usually younger folks finding themselves, never for adults. So I was coming in with a preconceived notion.
Damn, that’s interesting.. as a trans girl who’s binary as fucking shiiiit it’s very cool!!

Edit: also as someone who identifies heavily feminine I also dislike the whole “pass” thing
Woah. Thanks for helping me feel a little better about this. For the longest time I used he/it then gravitated toward they/them because of the dissent from people who didn't agree with 'it' Pronouns. I lean more on nonbinary/Trans spectrum but this literally how I have always felt/thought about it. It is more genderless.
No need to apologize, I do feel like I can understand a little bit better now so I appreciate the opportunity to learn.
>For me part of why I use these pronouns is to reclaim them

Except you're forcing other people to participate in that reclamation as well. Also very important, exactly what are you reclaiming this from? It's this finally an admittance that you're using slurs for pronouns?
They meant they don’t understand why other people can’t get it right, not that they don’t understand your sentiment. 

I feel like the original comment was fairly understanding, but I may be biased because that’s essentially my take on it as well. But it also depends on context. One of my shitty coworkers referred to a nonbinary coworker with “and she said...”, I corrected her “they, actually”, and she says “whatever. *It* said...” In this context I was absolutely against its use, as it was clearly with ill-intent. If someone says it uses it/its, I’d absolutely use them for it. But unless someone explicitly uses those pronouns, I consider using them harmful 

On an unrelated note, I don’t think I’ve typed the word “it” so many times at once
I fully respect your choice of pronouns and will use whatever pronoun you'd like.  While I understand that it's ok to not understand someone's choice of pronouns, would you like to be understood and have a empathic connection to humanity?  This may be a super silly question and I hope my ignorance by asking doesn't imply anything that would manifest a negative feeling.  If you don't want to be understood I will quit trying out of respect.
Its a subculture of sorts. Steampunk has nothing inherently related to either of these but it’s a -punk subculture. Hyphen there makes a difference.
Thank you and I hope you have a lovely day as well. I wouldn’t have noticed the spelling I suck at spelling and grammar lol.
Makes sense. You cant really force how you feel about something. If youre the type of being that feels better with it/its, who am I to disrespect its wishes.
>You make very important and valid points, but for those cases where using my pronouns would be harmful to you please just use my name.

Thank you for that. Using your name in those scenarios is the very least I can do, and if it's more comfortable than they/them or any other pronouns that make you uncomfortable, consider it done.
Thank you so much for your response. I really appreciate it. I wish you the best!
Thank you for your response, what you said does make sense. While the name thing is definitely iffy with some trans people, I feel that in this case it would work as a work around for people with trauma as it/it’s pronouns are more likely than other pronouns to be connected to trauma. I appreciate that you are willing to let people use that work around for you even if it sounds weird. I’ve never had anyone call me it in a personal attack before, much of my iffiness around using it/it’s pronouns for a person comes from the more broad attacks I’ve seen on the groups I am apart of. So I was speaking more so for others that I have seen that have genuine trauma connected to it/it’s pronouns.
Exactly! I do see where you're coming from though and I read some of your other comments too. You're completely in the right here, but you also have to keep all options open
Your trauma is not something anyone should have had to go through, but it does not give anyone an excuse to misgender those who prefer those pronouns and possibly those who would like to reclaim them because of their own trauma. I'm sorry and do not mean to sound insensitive. Interactions between individuals must be handled case by case since there cannot be never be a single rule of thumb. Your trauma deserves to be respected, but so does my identity and the identity of others like me. And it's the responsibility of both parties to not step on each other's toes. I do hope that you are able to have the opportunity to process your trauma and apologize that this topic caused you distress.
Ok.

1.  Just because you have trauma around that pronoun doesn't mean other people can't use that pronoun. You can't speak for everyone. 

2. Yeah it CAN be harmful. Only when bigots refer people with the pronoun it to misgender others.
this may sound insensitive, but;

your personal comfort is not something you are entitled to impose onto our identities. your trauma is valid but it is not an excuse for you to misgender people or tell them how to cope with their own experiences with dehumanisation.

A substantial amount of people using it/its are people who chose to reclaim the dehumanisation they received. 

people minding their own business and using it/its pronouns for themselves, for whatever reason, do not hurt you, the people who traumatised you are the ones hurting you.
But isn't that what you and OP are doing? ""It"" is a literal slur used against trans people. I know I'll get a lot of hate for saying this, but if you get euphoria from being treated as less than human, you have issues.
[removed]
Thank you! And no problem, always happy to add some more perspective to things if I can!
yeah youre definitely right! i couldve worded my comment better
i'll be sure to let it know, you have a nice day aswell!
 we dont need to understand or ""approve"" of someone's identity, but we still need to respect it. 

you being hurt by that is totally understandable, as its been used against you, but you still dont have any say over what makes someone else happy, and nobody is getting hurt by them using it for themselves.

(not here to debate, just trying to explain how i view it)

((sorry hit send too soon, i rewrote my original reply))
>we do not deserve to have that community subject us to the rhetoric that those who have oppressed us have used on the community as a whole

So fucking ironic coming from the person who pronouns are precisely have been what was used to oppress the community as a whole and by requiring other people to participate in it you're literally forcing this rhetoric onto the community as a whole
If people are working to ""reclaim"" it then they pretty clearly indicates it's in a category of stuff used against trans people. I reclaim tr@**y but only for myself, only in the presence of people I know are ok with it and you better fucking believe I'm not going to go and call other trans people transphobic for not calling me that. Insanity
Well considering binary references the ""one or another"" type of style of traditional gender roles in which male and female exist, and it just simply means not one or the other. So whilst it can be described as no gender, that's assuming male and female are the only genders. Whilst agender by definition is the lack of gender. Just like how asymptomatic diseases have a complete lack of symptoms
It's a seperate thing from male and female. That doesn't mean it's not a gender. Agender is the complete lack of gender. If gender is a sliding scale, nonbinary is somewhere else sitting in the corner eating triscuits
Happy to help in what little way I can!
Reclaiming their discrimination. Using it as a way to turn back at those who called them an object just because they're trans. Nobodys calling it a slur. It may not have been the best word to use but yeah. Also they ain't forcing jack shit. Its its pronouns and its valid as hell! Infact, props to it for having the pride to be comfortable and happy using something thrown their way just to put them down
I would like to apologize for the obvious frustration in the original post, and thank you for being civil when it comes to something as serious as slurs.
You as well!
I'd like to thank you as well! Your reply was very insightful friend.
Love how they try to force others to be uncomfortable with the excuse of their comfort.
Slurs can be reclaimed. You do not have to reclaim it yourself if you do not want but you do not get to tell me I cannot. Your trans experience is not universal. Names exist. Use them. Don't know their name? Ask em. Or just don't refer to someone who uses it/its. My post is not telling you to use it/its it's saying don't misgender me with because you're uncomfy. Human interaction is a case by case kind of thing. And communication is important when trauma and misgendering is involved.
I don’t see myself as less than human. Unlike they/them, it/its isn’t gendered at all, and that’s what makes it more fitting for people that are, for example, agender. It’s not my fault if you see me as less than human for wanting to feel more secure in my identity.
[removed]
Imaging the trans person just slightly out of ear shot hearing someone get called it. The perception of safety in that place just did a full 180
>If people are working to ""reclaim"" it 

This literally isn't about reclaiming anything. It's about respecting someone's choice of pronouns. Not everyone has a binary gender identity.
I get that agender is a somewhat common more-specific term to describe the abscence of gender (and that's great if you like the specific term!), but that doesn't mean that non-binary is a gender. Some people like to use these more specific & solid terms to describe their identities/gender, and some don't. Technically, according to terms online, I would fit into the tropes of an androromantic autochorissexual demigirl, but I don't ID with those at all. I'm just a queer non-binary person. Non-binary is not my gender, but rather a descriptor of my experience with gender, as that experience is not binary. As for my gender itself, I don't have a label for that, its just non-specific
[removed]
Yours was as well fellow trans person.
[removed]
well its all about context, i remember i was having a conversation about a certain post on facebook, the persons trans child being referred to with it/its, i was originally shocked but then the poster clarified that that is what their child told them to use (and the parent DID clarify this on the same post to clear confusion). as soon as i read that i was totally ok and almost kind of happy that a parent would step so far out of a comfort zone just to make their child happy.

my point of view is of someone who doesn't use it/its, nor have had those pronouns used to harm me, so my insight on the situation is *very* limited, i will never be able to speak for anyone else, but i can say with what little confidence i have that i will respect anyone who wants to use those for themself. they are only using it for themselves, and im sure if it made someone else genuinely uncomfortable to use, they would sort things out privately (such as using name instead of pronouns, etc)

you cant help what you feel about something, and i am not saying that you are rude in anyway for being uncomfortable using them, your viewpoint is just as valid as someone who uses it/its, but they cant help what they feel about it either, and those pronouns make them feel most comfortable in their own gender, and again they aren't forcing it on anybody else, so i would still recognize this and respect their choice

(sorry if this seemed aggressive, that wasnt my intention at all, im just very long winded)
Yes. Non specific version to say neutral. Someone can be a homosexual biromantic demiboy specific label wise and still call themselves a gay male. Everyone can fit themselves under a label of nonbinary, male, or female. Nonbinary is somewhat the other option. What you're saying is that nb is the option of leaving the ""choose gender"" tag on a survey. In which it is the ""other"" tag. What the boxes of gender are are just three seperate umbrellas. Agender doesn't want an umbrella and is standing out in the rain. Whilst the nonbinary umbrella exists. It's like hot cold and lukewarm. While it can be seen as a sliding scale, you're always somewhat closer to one of them and are in that case grouped with it. Agender is seperated from that scale at all, pretty much existing as the option to not have a tempature. If you are able to present as your label, it's a gender. NB is the androgynous. Male is the masculine. Female is the feminine. As an agender individual i do not present. I do not exist. Please do not refer to me. Thank you and have a nice day.

It's just very obvious when op even admits they are trying to reclaim those pronouns. What are they reclaiming it from exactly? Why are it it's pronouns something that can even be reclaimed? Is it because they ARE CURRENTLY weaponized against trans people, POC, and various other minorities?

I reclaim the t slur for myself. I have enough respect for the people around me to not expose them to that word if I don't know beforehand how they feel about it. I don't go around throwing the T slur out and then just clarify to everyone I offend that ""it's actually ok I'm reclaiming it."" No I understand it's a word with a lot of baggage and I can't guess how it will impact the people around me. OP ignores the people around them and doesn't care if it causes harm.

Even with the N word there are black people that don't feel it should ever be reclaimed, even hundreds of years later,and sometimes you'll go over someone's house and get told her don't use the n word, my mom grandma dad, whoever, is very uncomfortable with it.

I recognize that with the reclaiming of anything there will be people who think it's ok to reclaim and others who do not. I'm ok with reclaimation until the point where you are forcing others to participate in it as well. Not too mention the added audacity of calling trans people transphobic for not using those pronouns. Imagine calling a black person racist because they didn't want to call their friend the n word
Non-binary is absolutely not the androgynous. Again, it is a term defined by what it's not, it doesn't have any inherent traits. If you're using a sliding scale,  I would say there is one solid point on the scale that is ""male"", one solid point on the scale that is ""female"" and anything not on those solid points is non-binary. It is not a third point on the scale, but rather is breaking free from these solid-set points entirely. I understand if you don't personally want to use the term and separate yourself out as only Agender, divorced from the non-binary label entirely. But that doesn't change the definition of non-binary as literally meaning ""not binary"" in whatever capacity someone IDs as.

No, Trans Women Do NOT Have an Advantage Over Other Women, Caitlyn Jenner!	"Sorry if this is a rant, everyone, but what truly pisses me off is how the media loves to talk down on the transgender community. Like for what? It's mostly the same recycled crap that was fed to gay people. I'll be glad when we get the recognition we deserve too, because I feel like it divides the LGBT community. If I simply type in ""transgender,"" I see nothing but article after article attacking some woman who was just achieving her dreams. Seriously, she's not hurting anyone and is most likely on estrogen. She's my age. I'm not sure how long Lia's been on E, but I've been on T for over 3 years. 3 years! If she's transitioned as long as I have, there is no way she has a disadvantage over other women. HRT alters muscle and bones if you start early enough. I know because it changed my body permanently, and my upper body is waaaaayyyy stronger now. Trans women shouldn't be berated over who they are just because they won a championship. Seriously, I don't get it. Media fabricates it to look like she's just intruding, misgendering her, like trans women don't deserve a role model, or like cisgender women always lose. 

The fact that Caitlyn Jenner is so willing to advocate against transgender women havung the freedom to do what she couldn't do just isn't fair and selfish to me. There are many of us on the fence, who would love to be on a team as who we truly are, but are discouraged by this. IT's obvious and appalling that she's working for terfs and right-wing liberals who hate transgender people for any accomplishment they have, especially transgender women—just to give herself a pedestal. If she truly believes the crap she spews, that trans women are in it to ""destroy women"" and need to be grouped with the male division, maybe she should just speak for *herself*. How can a trans woman be so naive about her own identity? Not to mention all of the other things out there about her seemingly misgendering herself to a blind transphobic eye and announcing that she allows her kids to, calling her ""dad,"" so some terf will expect every trans person to want the same. 

Psssh. Me personally, my kids won't even be allowed to call me ""Mr. Mom"" let alone ""mom."" Some of us take our identity and lives more seriously, taking precaution when sharing so much stuff that can be misconstrued by the transphobic media that she gladly shares with. Cis people don't get that she does not speak for every trans person, but really just herself. I get she's non-dysphoric, and that is fine, but why publically announce these things if you're so in touch with people's OPINIONS on trans people? She's the reason why there's so many terf novels, and people refusing to understand or take us seriously. She's a true ""transtrender,"" since she's also sadly the most known trans individual for her reputation. It's a shame *she's* taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back — when she doesn't realize terfs hate her too, whether she sides with them or not. She should cut that out. Someone her age should know better than to bully so many young women and out of jealousy since she had to compete with men. Some ""trans mom."" SMFH"	"As a trans woman who is also a competition fighter this gets brought up all the time by even organisers, I represent our clubs mixed team so I fight in the mixed gender category so its not an issue luckily, however at our last tournament the organisers came over and told the team that if I wanted to fight in the women's category I would have to fight in the weight class above my own cause of my biological advantage so its fair, I am at the bottom of my current weight class as the lightest fighter in that class for them mixed in the whole tournament. When on of my female team mates asked if she could fight in the male fights for the weight class below hers as that should be the same they told her she couldn't cause it would be dangerous to have people from different weight classes fighting. Anyway I got second in the mixed category after getting my head kicked in by this incredibly talented woman. So my ""advantage"" didn't help me there.
Yep in terms of sports, the science/data backs you up, at least for trans people that have been on HRT/Hormones for certain amount of years. If anyone says that trans women/men have any advantage in sports then they are quite literally denying science and data.

In other aspects of life nah, Trans people do not have any sort of advantage and anyone who says so is just a transphobe
Caitlyn Jenner has advantages over other women.

She’s cartoonishly rich.
Sports is just the go-to weapon of choice for transphobes right now. A lot of people are passionate about sports and trans women beating cis women in sports might seem more believable to the uneducated than trans people being pedohiles or invading bathrooms to assault people.
It’s very frustrating, science doesn’t seem to matter at all nor be desired on this topic.
Have you seen this post? https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/seoodq/at_the_risk_of_getting_hate_responses_but_the_lia/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share

OP of it is basically being a transphobe and disagreeing with science, its sad to read through the post and some of the comments. How people can deny science and think they're being a good ally to trans people is beyond me.

Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports
Too many people take sports more seriously than human rights.
I'm 100% with you on the issue of sports - transgender women should compete in woman's sports. All the data and science backs that up. I also agree how incredibly frustrating it is that Caitlyn Jenner, to a lot of people, is seen as the main ""voice of trans woman"" - I'm absolutely not a fan of hers and her views that she proudly shares with the world are deeply problematic for trans people.

I did want to talk about her kids calling her ""dad"" and that general concept. I'm a binary trans woman whose son calls her ""daddy"". I started my transition after he could talk and already was referring to me as daddy and I didn't want to give that name up. We tried some different ones and nothing felt right; I realized I was trying to force another name just to match typical gender norms and so I said ""screw it"". The way he excitedly exclaims ""Daddy!"" just melts my heart, I clearly formed a strong emotional connection to the name my son calls me. I tear up at the thought of giving that up and I don't feel like I'm taking my identity or my life less seriously because of that.

Now of course it's completely valid for trans people to feel uncomfortable being referred to as their AGAB's typical parent name and want to go with the one that matches their actual gender (in my case that would be going with ""mom"" or ""mommy""). I am very strict with everyone else in my life about using correct pronouns (she/her) and my chosen feminine name. What I'm trying to say is it is all valid. I would be cautious of starting down the road of referring to certain trans people as less serious about their gender identity and less valid for simply not conforming to the restrictive gender norms society expects.
Yes thank you for writing that. I'm endlessly annoyed seeing people that don't understand anything about the science and biology around trans people try to argue about this. It's almost always bad faith arguments that come from purposeful ignorance and bigotry. It also comes from defining and seeing trans women as ""biological males"" which in most people's minds means biologically the exact same as cis men.

If someone was truly arguing about it in good faith and evidence based science then we could actually make sure things are fair, safe, inclusive and equal. Based on the science it is fair for little kids that are prepuberty to play and compete against each other regardless of gender. Then once puberty starts it is acknowledged that people with CAIS (biologically male but androgen insensitive) can fairly compete against women. So there should not be any argument against teens on puberty blockers and hormones competing as their gender. If someone cannot accept even this, which is completely fair biologically and well understood then the problem is not about biological advantages and unfairness and it's about transphobia only.

There is some uncertainty about the performance of trans people that went through their first puberty before transitioning and how that compares to the difference between cis men and cis women. There is a massive lack of scientific research here and that's what's being exploited by transphobes. There's a lot to say about the current research and it does look in favor of trans people competing fairly but there is still not much data. If there are provable and demonstrable unfair advantages or disadvantages that go beyond what performance enhancing polymorphisms provide then maybe we could look into how to help trans athletes compete fairly by researching the differences between trans and cis performance and what can be done about it.
Every time someone pulls the 'trans women have an advantage in sports because of tEsToStErOnE' card all I can think of is how the last few times I've gotten bloodwork done my testosterone levels have been lower than those of an average cis woman because of HRT.
Scientific evidence has shown that if anything, transitioning actually gives trans women a disadvantage. I don't know whether that's true from a biological perspective but collected data reports that the vast majority of trans women that compete in sports come in the middle of the pack. If this narrative were true we'd be regularly dominating the women's sports scene. We're not. The trans women that do rank in first or near it work damn hard to get there.
Caitlyn Jenner really needs to get her head out of her ass.  She may have an advantage over others because she’s super fucking wealthy.  Not your average trans woman who might face much more hardships and disadvantages compared to cis people.  People like her do not make it better or easier for trans people to gain more tolerance and acceptance.
Caitlyn Jenner does NOT represent the entire transgender community. She doesn’t even represent all transgender women. She and many cisgender people only think she does, but in reality Caitlyn Jenner only represents herself.
I think the current NCAA qualification rules are a fair solution that should be a model to follow in schools. At least 1 year continuous on HRT (and remaining on HRT) for athletic eligibility. At that point natural advantages are mostly reversed.  I see it as a good compromise between fairness and inclusitivity.
I avoid being taken in by anti trans athlete arguments because I honestly know little about sports or athletics. Like, anti-trans people expect us to be experts in everything. To answer all their questions, I would need a deep knowledge of sports history, biology, sociology. And I don't really think facts would change their mind because transphobes aren't gonna be asking any of this in good faith. 

Instead of playing their game, I would ask transphobes why they suddenly give a damn about women's sports. Where were they when women were being paid pennies on the dollar compared to their male counterparts? Where were they when coaches faced repeated sexual assault and rape claims? And most importantly, where is their evidence that transgender women are dominating in sports? 

The nonsensical arguments of talking heads is ultimately just hot air. I would try not to get worked up over it
I agree with you. They should be treated equally. Just because trans women want to be who they want, doesn't mean others should judge them for it
Reasons why I don't reveal my trans status to any of the physical activities I participate in. People crap on Lia now they crapped on Fallon Fox, Chloe Jonnson had to sue crossfit to compete because they disqualified her for being trans. Like it's a nightmare and in it were told we can't participate in sports, we are told we shouldn't participate in fashion after the outrage for Valentina Sampaio becoming a VS model.

Like no one wants us anywhere and it's sad.
""It's a shame she's taking advantage of who she is, clowning herself to hold us back"". good word choice.
Reminder that Caitlyn Jenner transitioned when she did to avoid being charged with vehicular manslaughter. That said, she's just an awful mouthpiece for cishets and the right wing to use however they desire, they know she doesn't give a shit about the queer community and will happily generalize every trans person's experience to her disconnected richest 1% daydream.
This is why I wouldn’t want to be any kind of famous or well-known, being trans. There’s just too much stigma. 

And I think “society” will always be transphobic, unfortunately. I think it only gets worse from here as the cis-het conservative backlash moves on. We’re their new bogeyman, the way gay people were in the 90s and atheists were in the 00s.
I have nothing positive to say about Caitlin and hate that she has somehow become a person that represents the trans community because she is rich and I'm a firm believer in allowing athletes to compete as their gender but I completely disagree with you on allowing her kids to call her dad.  I transitioned later when my youngest was 15 and the oldest 24.  I am and always will be their dad and I am proud for them to refer to me as dad.  I also realize that not everyone would feel the same way and would want to be called something else and if that is what you want then that is perfectly fine and you should do what feels right to you but don't start criticizing other with a different take as it easily comes off as we are not ""trans enough"" unless we conform to your ideals.
It's intersectional. All else being equal Cis men have advantage over cis women but cis women have advantage over trans women. Because trans women may (MAY) spend time as presenting as a cis man, it becomes intersectional.

Caitlyn is such a cunt.  Can someone please take her crown?
Goofy.

HRT can add, but it cannot take away.  It can give you boobs, but it can’t take away your boobs.  It can give you strength, but it can’t take away your strength.

Your experience taking testosterone is not the same as a male’s experience taking estrogen.
I'm a trans woman and grad student and regularly do women's intramural sports as something to do just so I'm active and not completely socially isolated doing dissertation research all the time.

I absolutely \*suck\* at said women's sports. I actually \*like\* basketball, but even then, last time I played in the women's basketball tournament, my team lost in the first round 15-2.

And then there was me playing women's volleyball when I couldn't hit the ball over the net the entire game.... and the fact that my 5k run times are actually in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket...

I do these sports because I like doing it and being physically active, but if you watch me perform it's damn obvious that I am not \*remotely\* at an advantage to other girls and am low average at best. It's clear that the people saying they think trans women have an advantage have never actually seen a trans woman perform athletically.
[deleted]
Actually there's a bit of nuance here. Those who took puberty blockers and hrt see no significant benifit. Unathletic trans women who became athletic after transition likewise saw no significant benifit.

The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

And even where there was an advantage, such as with power lifting, there was a noticeable loss in said advantage over time. So basically trans women DO have an advantage, but only in a vanishingly small number of events, only when they were near professional athlete level pre-transition, only when they never stop training after transition, and seemingly only for a temporary amount of time.

Edit: I want to make something clear: I'm steelmanning the opposing arguement. There's very little research into this topic and what little does exist is lacking in a lot of ways. Once you weed out the terrible studies (ill elaborate down below), what little does exist finds no advantage outside of a few studies that specifically looked at high level athletes who transitioned. 

In generally, mildly or non-athletic folks who transition will see no advantage besides maybe height. I didn't see much good evidence asserting blood oxygen levels are higher in trans athletes, which is a common right wing talking point. I also didn't see evidence that trans women have an advantage in sports of endurance or technique. There is evidence that trans women have a disadvantage in swimming, though again there's not much research.

As for the study i referenced, the researcher measured thigh circumference and made the assumption that sush a measurement is correlative to overall strength. On top of small sample sizes, she failed to isolate a bunch of variables such as height, body fat composition, weight, and more. That's all on top of the fact that said researcher in question was a TERF

shit I was in a women's basketball tournament in December as a trans woman.... our team lost 15-2 in the first round and I fell flat on my back halfway through the match. And that's not counting the women's volleyball game where I couldn't hit the ball over the net. Some advantage I have lol...

Also I've been a distance runner since high school and my run times have \*dropped\* like 10 minutes on HRT, and are now in the low average range for \*women\* in my age bracket.

Been on HRT for almost 4 years.
[deleted]
What about Lia Thomas whose swim times literally blow cis women's olympic winning times to pieces? This conversation is not cut and dry.
There is no advantage, hence why we are constantly seeing biological women competing in mens leagues, oh wait….
Hot take: rich people aren't people and what they think doesn't matter.
[deleted]
i guess they'll keep changing the story to fit their narrative
which is so stupid too because if you've ever seen trans women compete in women's sports you'd see how silly the idea of a ""biological advantage"" is. 

Like... if we had so much of an advantage, how come I can't hit the ball over the net in women's volleyball? And how come my basketball team got knocked out of the women's basketball tournament last month in the first round with a 15-2 loss?  And how come my 5k run times are low average for women in my age bracket?
[removed]
Its Because for the conservative it's not really about science, sports or fairness, it's about hate, it's about marginalizing us. They never cared about women's sports and they still don't, it's just a useful tool at this moment
right, and they say *we* ignore science
Calling Ben Shapiro anything but by his name has to be one of my favorite running jokes. I like calling him bep shapeepo
that guy is seriously brainwashed
>Trans people do not have any sort of advantage at all over cis people in and out of sports

Source: trust me bro
It's so dumb... I actually \*like\* sports... but I like \*playing\* them, and love the social bonding experience and keeping fit. That's all I'm in it for. 

I really don't understand the obsession with competition that so many people have surrounding it, like their entire self worth and identity is riding on winning.
Yeah, but she's telling terfs/transphobic media outlets something that is personal, that can easily be misconstrued out of proportion to the point where they believe we all would feel this way, or that feeling this way means gives them a right to misgender us. It's different if she shared that in a transfriendly forum like you did. She shouldn't tell people who could care less about us about her life like that. 

The problem is her hypocrisy though; it just doesn't make herself look bright doing what she's doing.

It fuels the transphobia we face, and cis people who can't even wrap their heads around why someone would need to transition just won't get it. They can't even get something as self-defining as gender dysphoria. All of her actions now tell me that maybe she feels insecure about herself. Even if she's projecting hate towards other trans women, it speaks volumes for how she must feel about herself, being unable to emphathize with transgender people to the degree that she is for cis people who are unoppressed (unless racially, culturally or religously). I don't think I've ever seen her come up and say something that advocates for us, shutting down the hate we receive rather than to turn a blind eye to it. I'm glad she didn't become governor, and fear if she did. I would hate to see her try and take away medical access — knowing her, she probably would support anything that is against us and our wellbeing
very lesbian of you to be a woman who likes being called daddy
Didn't the NCAA change that a couple days ago? Basically abdicated the responsibility and threw it to individual sport's ruling bodies?
Exactly! If trans people and youths were given rights and equality, and were made to be safe in their family and homes then many trans youths wouldnt have gone through the wrong puberty.

Many trans youth have to live in hiding until they can move out of their family home because they are in an unsafe family and cant speak out or get medical help for their transitioning and identity until well after puberty.

I had to go through the male puberty despite knowing i was trans since I was a young child, and i couldnt speak up about myself because I was in a very religious family, that i often got physically and verbally abused in. So i stayed quiet until i was in a more supportive and safe environment. I had no other option but to go through the wrong puberty
Nope, just the transphobes and terfs don't. Let's not scatter and allow them to decimate our representation. Gay people dealt with the same thing until people realized gay people weren't going anywhere because it was never a choice. Same for us. Sadly, terfs will probably try to discourage us for another decade or two, since it was only the late 90's when clinical trials became available. That's why that stupid crossdresser stereotype is out there, cementing the hard past that the trans generations that came before us endured before HRT..
Caitlyn Jenner is a TRANSGENDER TERF. That's clowning herself, since I never knew you could be BOTH transgender and a terf. I can't see how she can give a greenlight to gatekeep trans women from competing where they belong, and invalidating like that WHILE telling her that it is ""good for her to be playing as her authentic self."" Seriously contradicting herself, and she is a seen as the one transgender with a voice out of all of us, just because of her children's careers. I mean who doesn't know the Kardashians.

If she was cis, she's just be a terf. There is undeniable internalized transphobia going on even if she is just allowing transphobic people to use her as a commanding voice for them. Idk how she's just taking charge of women's leagues. I get she is a retired Olympic gold medalist, but she shouldn't take advantage of an opportunity to do something right for her community for a change rather than trying to speak for all of us in a negative light. She should either defend this girl who is *50 years younger than her*, old enough to be her grand child, or decline to comment since they're probably not going to listen to her if she says something to validate us. 

I'm just imagining myself as Lia or any other trans woman who is excluded based off of a stereotype that has NO EVIDENCE to back it up, stringing this rumor along like she could care less. That's fucked up. If that isn't clowning around, idk what is. She calls herself an advocate for the transgender community, when she is a transgender terf, pushing the very transphobic rhetoric that is getting especially trans women killed. 

If she's not in it for the money terfs will pay her so that her reputation among the transgender community is destroyed, and greenlighting conversion therapy to scare particularly women and girls who are trans from following their dreams, then what is she doing? Why would she want people of this generation to live like the people in the 70s-90s (when she was forced to compete with men) to go through what she did? That was conversion therapy if you really think about it since clinical trials for HRT to help trans people (when it was around for 60 years) only become available for us about 25 years ago, so that's how the ""crossdressing"" confusion came about since we were gatekept. I would HATE for things to go  back to that, but I guess she's envious of the new opportunities this generation of trans people have. I'm a bit envious of those who got peri instead of DI and hormonal blockers to skip that first puberty, but you don't see me advocating to gatekeep
that is true. i think the only reason why she's the mouthpiece is because it's like she's following a transphobic script based off of stereotypes
... transitioning doesn't improve your odds in the justice system, ever. Being rich enough to afford great lawyers does. She's bad enough without making stuff up
I'm sorry. I updated the sentence.
seriously. Why do people associate her with being a spokesperson for the trans community? Literally the entire community hates her ass, and there's so many other prominent trans figures you \*could\* be using instead, like Rachel Levine, Sarah McBride, Nicole Maines, or Laverne Cox.
Man I went from being able to lift over 100 pounds+ easy to having issues with 50+. Also sports are literally about who's genetically better in the first place but no one admits it. Basketball? Be tall... cycling? Endurance... hell Michael Phelps has double jointed ankles which give him better kicking range so get this ""born genetically different"" out of here if you won't call out all of it. Cause it just sounds like whining.
regularly**
**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you ignore this post like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. With her logic, I'd go to jail for trespassing on women's sports since I have normal male Testosterone levels and am larger than most of the dudes in my family, towering at 6'2 (5 inches taller than my pops) As long as I take my weekly stomach shots, work out and eat right, I will always have the advantage Lia is accused of having with baseless claims made by people who don't know her and are exploiting her for money**

I clearly stated in the first paragraph that HRT alters bones and muscle if you start early enough. I didn't have significant bone changes from the first puberty at all. If you counter in science, the bones don't reach the peak mass until the age of 30, declining within every decade to follow. Lia is 22, and likely is on estrogen, and has been for a while (don't know her personally). This will be just a guess. Everyone's body is different. 

The argument *is* scientific because it's not an opinion, not guesses like those made about Lia without even seeing her play or looking at her league's stats. 

I'll use myself as an example since I'm the same age as her and transgender as well. 

I started T at the age of 18, shortly before my 19th birthday. Despite trying to adapt to the lifestyle of a cis woman, I've always been clocked as a man, so estrogen's effect on me was subtle. Just before I started T, I noticed the hip bones begin to widen, after gathering so much fat that I was unaware that it wasn't. Jumbo thighs and huge butts run in my family, for both the men and the women. The only thing estrogen really did was inhibit my ability to lose the weight in my lower body and gain upper body weight. 

My facial structure and bones are something I'm happy about since it's apparent just how the testosterone my body produced had the upper hand when it came to these characteristic gems. Even my height is around the 90th male percentile, because starting T resumed the growth presumed to of been stunted from the age of 14 up until 19. I grow around 0.15-0.5cm a month on average, so subtly it tastes months to notice. I'm someone who revolves my diet and my supplemental intake on my transition, not just take testosterone. I do this because I am not on E-blockers and haven't had an easy way of accessing it, like many transgender individuals. Due to my genetic makeup: inherited growth spurts, delayed puberty (i noticed it all began when I was 8, with breast development, but noticed stuff still happening 10 years later) Luckily, the women on my mom's side particularly have higher T levels than average, and can grow small beards or facial hair in general; this was a genetic lottery for me, since pretty much all the guys in my immediate family have facial hair that connects.

T squared out my jaw. I'd be more than happy to share pictures comparing my facial changes. Some are muscle, some are bone. I had an alien-like, long egg head before, with a skinny pixie chin. Now my face is wide and boxy. Rather than recede like I naturally appeared to without T's influence, my hairline grew IN, back to the original strong widow's peak that I was born with.

I take stem cells and do clay masks regarly, so I notice evolution to a higher degree. The general life of the cells in your body is 7 years, sometimes up to 10. This is usually around the time (6-12 yrs) when trans people feel the most content. Their changes depend heavily on the receptors in the body, responsible for regulating the body's individual response.

I am a body builder so my cells are always rejuvenating. Estrogenized cells that may be still present 3 years in, given the lifespan of cells, are killed and replaced by cells that responded more heavily to testosterone before and after HRT.

This doesn't mean that testosterone is stronger or better, just that my own genetic makeup responded more to it. 

Estrogen and female are seen as the default settings in development, so the face, arms, feet and voice don't grow or develop nearly as much — and will remain almost prepubescent-like only if the estrogenic receptors are weaker. Testosterone has a heavy influence on bones, not just estrogen. We can't forget, estrogen does too. Trans women who start soon enough may notice permanent hip changes, and a ceize in the widening of the shoulders and back.

That being said, if Lia is just as far as me in this, she does not have an advantage. Caitlyn Jenner is either full of sh*t, or she really wants the world to go back to pretending that trnsgender people is a 20th century phdnomenon that cannot be debunked in anyway with facts and science. Do your own research before you decide to have a debate. I gave my facts, and you have to give yours if you are worthy of a response from me, or I take it you have none because such an article contradicting doctors and science do not exist. 

Why should men join women's leagues and not women? I'm a real man, who needs testosterone to have a normal day to day life, or else something would be missing from my life that a man shouldn't be robbed of. I will never go off of T or fulfill the dreams of hypocrite, uneduacated terfs or be indoctrinated into the puppetry Caitlyn Jenner is in, to fill the needs of other people's lives just because *they're insecure that I exist.*

Instead, I'll keep existing along with different species of transgender animals out there. God even made transgender people who can develop a penis at the age of 12. Mine is developing much later, despite the micro dimensions it retains so far, I'd rather it than a vagina. I can jerk it, unsheathe it, and penetrate — before going under any knife (sorry if TMI) but men can't help but value our penises like women value their breasts. A phallus is homologous, meaning shared among almost every living thing of any gender preference, so saying someone is dickless like many of you presumably transphobic or naive people do is way more unscientific sounding to me. Women just don't want to call it a penis and estrogen keeps the development of the penis in people who are AFAB in limbo just to keep your precious heterosexuality alive. That doesn't mean that facts care about your feelings over mine. 

**FYI being trans is more than feelings, I already know I'm a whole ass dude if you decide to ignore this like most who hate the truth do. also, believing everything Caitlyn says for all trans people is naive. If you're a dude who's heterosexual, it's kinda gay to think we could end up in the bed together over the ambiguity of genetalia of chromosomes alone, and that you'd kiss my hairy face and stroke my swollen 100% masculinized muscles, don't you think?**
This is definitely something I have thought about. People's perception of sports is skewed by only watching elite athletes where every little advantage helps. They don't consider that most people (who play for fun or compete at amateur level) have only average talent/athleticism in sports and half of people are worse than that.



THEN consider that a lot of trans people (not all, of course) would shy away from sports as a kid because of their dysphoria or social reasons, but might be willing to try post transition/later in life. Not that late starters can't be talented or anything, but obviously people who train from childhood have an advantage.
I mean this is like saying all black people are better athletes.  Strength and height are only one equation into being a great athlete, however there is a reason why there are sayings like, you can't teach height.    


I don't understand why Lia Thomas whether she is Ledecky good or just good for her weak division matters. From my perspective I think people want to make this a trans right issue but from my small mind I see the division the same reason we have men and women's sports. Again people will constantly point out how Thomas would be considered a high school star but no where near Olympic level, thus poses no real danger to cis women's sports, but that not the issue since in men's baseball not everyone who takes steroids automatically becomes Mark McGuire or Sammy Sosa and hits 70 homeruns a season, just like not ever trans athlete will come close to Ledecky, but the point is Thomas in my eyes has a pure edge since since was able to cultivate a men's body for the majority of her life and only recently transitioned. It be one thing if while transitioning she loss most of her mass and shrunk 3"" but as she stands she is 6'1"" and 210lbs of muscle.
The kicker is that's not the trans person's fault, either. If society would get the fuck over itself, trans women wouldn't have had to go through the wrong puberty in the first place.
As a sort of side question branching off this: Since a person’s body is undergoing changes, particularly those early dates, is exercise or competition potentially more dangerous?
Its small and not always true, several studies have been done that have been peer reviewed and upheld have been able to show that there is no significant link between trans people and having an advantage against their cis counter part, and most transgender people had a negative experience with sports due.

So again, the difference/advantage seems to be insignificant for the majority of trans folk. 

A lot of the studies that have tried to come out showing that there is, have been pretty much all discredited and proven wrong due to various reasons. People have tried and failed at finding any significant or major advantage.
>The only group that showed any advantage were high-performing athletes, and even then it was only for specific events. Namely, events to focused on strength such as lifting. Swimming, running, and technique based sports saw no significant advantage.

Quick question: can you please link me to the study/studies with these findings?  In researching this topic, I'm only locating sources that claim the opposite. Thank you!
Wouldn't there be a lingering advantage in events where height is helpful? For those women who transition later of course. Basketball, volleyball, high jump etc.
This argument is total bs. The fact that you are not a competent athlete doesn't mean that all the scientific date is invalid.
Heres one of the many studies that have disproven the lie that trans people have advantages in sports, when they dont. https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

But also do you're own research lmao, the burden of proof isnt on me, it's transphobes like OP and those who agree to disprove what I and science have claimed.

And just look up the many video essayists, and left leaning people on YouTube that fight for trans peoples rights lmao, many of them have made videos going over the research, and studies that have been done as well as debating transphobes over it as well.

I love how whenever transphobes say anything they always make the other person do the research for them, regardless of if they are right or wrong, transphobes and their supporters always do the minimal amount of research before saying their dumb shit
No, her swim times are record-setting **for her school**, which is far from the best in the sport. 

she's nowhere near the women's swimming version of Michael Phelps. And she did quite well pretransition relative to men.

God, I wish trans women were all Wonder Woman. That would be awesome. Unfortunately it's not the case.
She doesn't though.. She was beaten recently by 3 cis women and a pre-transition trans man.  


https://www.pinknews.co.uk/2022/01/10/lia-thomas-university-pennsylvania-iszac-henig-yale-trans/
dan, do your research, dude. don't be a follower of fake news. lia's swim teammates who want to exclude her from the team, and blame her identity the moment she wins a medal are transphobic.
Yes it is, lmao anyone saying differently is just simply transphobic, when science overwhelmingly agrees that trans people have no athletic advantage over their cis counter parts.

Pretty much every single study that has come out against trans people in sports has been debunked and discredited.

Whereas pretty much every study thats for trans people in sports and proves that there is no advantage has pretty much been shown and upheld their findings.

So again, love how transphobes like you try to deny science whenever it doesnt back you up, but the moment you think science does you dont. Always funny how transphobes will turn their back to science whenever it doesnt agree, but any moment science does support something you say, you hold it near and dear as if you've ""always"" believed in science
No, we hate her because she’s a shitty person
No, it’s not her money, it’s the fact that she’s a massive hypocrite. I was merely poking fun at her hypocrisy and using her words against her.
She also killed someone and got off scott free because of a lack of evidence to convict her on manslaughter.
Right back at ya
🤣🤣🤣🤣 here, you naive baby. convinced this is Caitlyn now

The rest seem to be stupid journalists, or news trying to keep up with the trend withour actually doing an investigation because they aren't biology experts, nor do they specialize in HRT, psychology, or bloodwork of any kind of labwork NOR do they have a statistic of the truth of trans women since like you, many just go by opinion to quickly get their story out there when expected. It's kind of like working on radio. If you're unsure, you'd hate to admit.

Federal law is against discrimination in workplace/school settings against sex and gender identity, so this will never be an abroad thing - EVER LOL, unless Trump returned.

There it is folx, from the *experts*!!!

Fuck your feelings, buddy. If you want to fight for women's equality, WTF are you waiting for now?


Because this is the stupicy you're fighting for, men and women competing, downright contradicting yourself. Women would not feel protected at all with men who will never detransition like me. I'm so obviously male that month 2 on T, I started getting horrified looks when I went into women's restrooms. One picked up her daughter and left as soon as she came in and saw me, so I've used public men's rooms no problem ever since, even while it's packed. If this happened in CA, I'd join a sport just to screw with this unscientific transphobic craze (since conversion therapy is proven to be ineffective) and I have no reason to want to be off of Testosterone > https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.si.com/.amp/golf-archives/2022/01/25/luc-esquivel-trans-sports-ban-boys-and-mens-teams-daily-cover
For the conservatives, yes. I'm talking more broadly than that, because this issue in particular splits our allies, who listen to science about other things like Climate. (people who are allies on other trans issues)
It's pretty irrelevant tho. If science says that trans women have an unfair advantage, then that's it. Why bring politics into this?
Literally the same! 😂 Sben shporkbo, his transphobic ass has so many hilarious names and i love the meme. Ben Shaboobo
Ikr! I could just see their YouTube search history in my mind... ben Shabeebo, blaire white and other transphobes.

The thing that really showed me they were being bad faith was that anytime science was brought up they would blindly turn an eye to it and ignore anything to do with science, because they full on knew that science proved them wrong so they didnt want to acknowledge those comments.

And whenever called out for being transphobic they'd just turn around and act like a victim.. like at one point they tried to act victimized by saying ""well you havent been sexually assault and dealt with transphobes like i have"" 

Yet i had to go over the SA i've been through, and that i've dealt with transphobes IRL and one of them was even an ex who almost took my life over my trans based identity.

I just dont get how someone like him can be so transphobic but then turn around and say ""nuh uh! Im trans myself therefor Its impossible for me to be transphobic"" like.. have they never heard about ""self hating trans people"" such as Blaire White.

Like... How can you be so misled by the lies spread by transphobes to go into a trans community and be blatantly transphobic and make yourself out to be the victim by saying ""boo hoo ya'll are a hive mind and attacking me for being transphobic when im trans""
No, its called look things up for yourself? There are plenty of studies that have come out that have proven and shown that trans people do not have any significant advantage over their cis counter parts.

The funny thing is pretty much every study that has come out saying that ""they do have a significant advantage"" has been discredited and disproven.

I love when transphobes and people like you expect the other person to provide you with all the evidence and proof, but you're side never has to show any evidence or proof. 

Its almost like ya'll transphobes deny science when it doesnt benefit you, but will take the side of science if it does benefit you 🤔 weird how that happens isnt it, ya',ll never have to show any proof for your claims yet you expect the other side to show proof of their claims.

You're the one who has to show the burden of proof, since you're the ones trying to refute the claim that science overwhelmingly agrees with
trust me bro is not a source🤣🤣🤣
Totally - context is important! And there's a way to responsibly share details like the above. For instance, if I somehow ended up with a big platform and what my kids call me comes up I'd be honest but explain why and end with a ""Keep in mind though not every trans person will be comfortable with it like I am. Make sure you check and respect what each person wants!"" And I doubt she did that - I'm really not trying to defend Caitlyn Jenner. 

Just addressing the notion that trans women whose kids call them ""dad""(or vice versa with trans men) or do other gender non-conforming things are taking this all less seriously and are hurting trans people. 

If 'society' see's a trans woman whose kids call her ""dad"" and runs with it saying ""See! Even they see themselves as men!"" that's societies problem and ignorance. Not the trans woman who's just living her life and doing what's comfortable. She shouldn't have to cover up details like that and conform to society's gender norms for the sake of having cis people take us seriously.
she's talking about her kids
Exactly. Like the antiwork Fox interview in a lot of ways, she's cherry picked to be a scapegoat, to selectively define a movement to an audience. AND to confirm the right's ""truths"" without being accused of speaking over the movement.

When you're a celebrity, a big ""scandal"" about your private life, like transitioning, can draw media attention away from you being a shitty human being and help you dodge the consequences.

Edit: also when you have that much money and clout you could absolutely say you're going through something difficult and life-changing to avoid prison time. Doesn't work if you're poor though.
Thank you!  I understand your preference is different than mine and tbh if I had transitioned when I was younger I would probably be more in line with your preference.  I'm just at a different point now with different perspective and we need to realize that both of our views are valid for us and all the other perspectives that others have are also valid.
She transitioned started E in 1986. She was among the first famous trans people to do it, and kept it under the radar for 30 years
That, but I also think cis people are presuming trans women are bio identical to cis guys and we just...arent. 

So many cis people don't even know that HRT is a thing, let alone what it does to you.
It's not that simple though. Children shouldn't make life changing decisions at that age.
I'm not an athlete by any stretch but I would do some fitness activities from time to time. I remember that I nearly passed out from trying to keep up with my coworkers about six months into HRT. I used to be about as or more fit than them, and never had problems managing energy before that.
Not aware of any science on this, but kids still play sports during puberty, so if it's more dangerous, it might only be marginally so, perhaps with a few specific pains, but probably no major counter-indication.
 I'll tell you during the next few months/years though :P (competitive badminton player here)
let's ban tall cis women too. The tallest cis woman on record was 7'7 (lol what a man! Sports cheater!) which seems pretty OP to me.
[deleted]
Except that the scientific data *does* point to trans women not having an advantage.

You lose any male athletic advantage when you lose testosterone.

It's anti science to pretend otherwise.

Also ask yourself why is it that the only trans women to even *qualify*  for the Olympics...placed last in their events? How would that be possible if there were such a huge advantage ? 

Hint: it's because we don't actually have one.
""Transphobes like OP"" What? Who said I was transphobic? That's a first 🤦‍♂️
All of the journalists on this story should be fired/sued for harassment and defamation, even if she wasn't a celeb.

I hope Lia is doing alright.

because… the science doesn’t…
Ben Shabooboo🤣🤣🤣
omg you are so right. it wouldn't surprise me if Ben Shapiro trolls this place. He refused to look at the facts I provided, and shyed away from any opportunity to explain how any of his claims were logical. ""it just is because i want it to be"" and explaining why cis people are cis isn't plausible enough for me. Caitlyn Jenner and Blair White like most terfs/trabsphobes are puppets, who feel insecure in some way about themselves about the existence of trans people and everyone else's stance. you'd expect cis people who know nothing to just stay out of the mix, but what surprises me more is when trans people betray their own.

Like how can they want this shit to continue happening to us, and bail on us the moment that they doubt themselves? I guess it's to appeal to the terfs/transphobes who aren't gonna change for us just like we aren't for them. Sometimes i wonder if they even are trans to think being transphobic is in anyway productive. To me, it just makes things worse — making us look bad. I think the only reason why Caitlyn Jenner is as popular as she is for making us look like deceivers. I don't want to say it's bad enough she transitioned at the age of around 65, after ""knowing for decades,"" but that doesn't help her look any better doing this crap.
""transphobes like me""!? how fucking DARE you!? you don't know what my views are, stop insulting people that go against your opinions!?
exactly what I'm saying.
i didn't mean it in that context lmao, just pointing out that that's what a butch lesbian might do
well, she should probably start declining to comment. It's not like she's desperate for money, and this really isn't doing her reputation well. Due to her being so easily-puppeteered to speak such nonsense that goes against facts, she didn't get my vote as governor.
What precisely do you think I was saying in my comment?

As I was apparently unclear, let me clarify: 

1. Caitlyn Jenner didn't transition to dodge manslaughter charges. Being trans doesn't make prosecutors go easy on you. 

2. Yes, she's utterly and irresponsibly wrong about trans women's bodies. No, trans women don't have ""unfair advantages.""
... no, you get the charges dropped via your expensive lawyer finding a plausible pretext. :p ""I was trans the whole time"" is not a get out of jail free card, even if it might distract a tabloid or ten.
That's def true. When I was younger, like an actual child, I'm pretty sure I just thought it was surgery and that's it. I never thought.about hormones or heard anything about it until I was much older and seeking out that information specifically
And that's exactly what puberty blockers are for. Buy time to speak with qualified therapists before your body does something miserable and irreversible to you.
Kids can play sports but they should not be extraneously training (such as for Olympic levels) as it can negatively impact their natural growth
Well, it we take 5'5"" as average for AFAB and 5'9"" for AMAB. Lose two inches (more than average?) for HRT shortening. Then it's 2 inches of advantage on average. So it's 2 inches of ""advantage"" on average.

I don't think that's cause to exclude trans women at all. But let's be realistic about the facts.
[removed]
I think they meant the person asking for the data citation, no OP of this thread. I certainly didn't think you were being transphobic
She’s given hate by the trans community for being racist and transphobic, not for being trans
It’s not a “personal narrative,” it’s an actual thing that actually happened. She rear ended a car, pushing it into oncoming traffic and killing the driver, and the DA did not press charges against her. [Here’s](https://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-manslaughter-charge-caitlyn-jenner-20150820-story.html) an article from when the crash happened. Someone is dead, it’s her fault, and she faced no repercussions for it.
Did you see the comments where he basically said ""sure trans people are a minority but so are CIS people"" I about died from that. How can you say that cis people, the people who are actively working against us (not all but the broad group i mean) and whom we often fear.. are a fucking minority group, when cis people or rather cis white people dont have to live in fear of losing all their rights.

Also the fact that he tried to call me a ""gatekeeper"" yet also responded to me by saying ""we'll ive been trans longer then most of you, in fact i was trans before it was popular and ive got more karma then you "" like.. as if thats not an attempt at gatekeeping the conversation, also.. like no duh? My accounts only 2 days old lol so ofcourse you'll have more karma then me.

It might be mean to say this, but i doubt that he/the op of that post was even a legit trans person. Like I just dont believe that someone who is trans and has experienced the struggle that we go through... To willingly defend transphobic lies, and disinformation and try to make the trans communities the aggressors and cis people to be the victims... Thats just so.. anti trans that i dont think an actual trans person would do such a thing.

Like after so much science denial, and made up bullshit that one can spout before it becomes obvious they dont actually know what being trans is like. 

Someone even pointed out to them that hormones take a huge toll on a persons body, and explained to them that ""estrogen is just as powerful as testosterone"" because the OP said that of the two hormones estrogen is the weaker one.

Nobody will be able to convince me that he wasnt just a bad faith actor who came here to cause drama and be harm, like how anyone could look at that post and their comments and think they were in good faith is beyond me
The reason is simple. Rather than help us stop the trains to the death camps, they want to make sure they are the absolute last ones put on them. Fuck Jenner and those like her.
Lmao you're the one denyong science here, and sorry anyone who can deny the science of this subject is just a transphobe. Also you're the one going ""trust me bro"" which is a transphobic persons favorite thing to day when the left make claims about subjects regarding trans people
does women with PCOS have an advantage too? they can grow beards after all. your logic:😬
It actually really just depends on several evidence based factors. I didn't think I had to dumb it down for you.

Someone who is still T-dominant, whether male or female, has normal or high male hormonal levels, and completed puberty shouldn't compete with women and girls just like cis women on steroids can't. That's why it's laughable that so many ""wannabe experts"" overlook this detail: Testosterone is a steroid when preferring to put women against transgender MALES (female to male).

This is a fact any level-headed trans person like me cannot argue with. Vice versa for E-dominance and competing with men. 

That creates the advantage, so I guess we're not as dumb as previously just assumed. 

If society does what the terfs want, trans men will probably be not allowed to compete at all since many of us are even stronger than the cis men in our age division and trans women wouldn't be able to overpower the upper body strength of men. I'm explaining to you what I already did a hour ago. You ignored it because it was too long, scientific, and technical.

Lia looks like she is within her first 5 years of estrogen. Don't let the bone changes of T-poisoning confuse you. Her muscle mass looks female to me, compaired to my veiny, bulging ones. Her face looks soft and estrogenic too so I have no doubt she's on Estrogen.

If she's been on hormonal blockers since she was a  pre-teen, or has been on estrogen for years, again — NO proven advantages unless she has Eddie Hall's rare condition. He's the world's strongest man, whose muscles do not atrophy or have a stopping point, which his daughter also inherited — giving them hulk-like physiques with little effort due to the rare condition, causing what I described: myostatin-related muscle hypertrophy. That or steroids would be the only advantage against cisgender women, NOT estrogen you dunce. 🤣🤣🥵

I hope Eddie Hall's cisgender daughter isn't disqualified over her ""advantage""
Haha thank you for clarifying. I was 50/50 on which way you meant it and so decided to just not respond.

I'm not butch but in regards to the lesbian stereotype... if the Doc Martens fits 🤷‍♀️
my bad i thought you were taking up for Caitlyn
Delay puberty till you're 18 years old? Seems unlikely.
Yeah, I'm only speaking of competition at, say, regional level ? I was not speaking about people who specifically train to be world-class in their sport - sorry for the misunderstanding
[deleted]
""Tower over the girls"" LMAO!!! 

Dude..im 5'7"" and a trans woman, and not even the tallest woman on my basketball team.

Shit, I've had a cis woman teammate who is like twice my size. I'm a really *tiny* skinny little thing. Despite what you seem to think, we don't all look like she hulk, and it is more than possible for cis women to be bigger and taller than us.

Shit, Michelle Obama, Melania Trump, and Sigourney weaver are all 4 inches taller than me. They are all cis.

And yeah you actually *do* lose all male athletic ability. Shit, my boyfriend can pin me to the ground just by laying his foot on top of me, and I can't open jars anymore without help. 

And again, if there was such a magic 15% difference how is it possible that I am in the *lower* average for my run times for women in my age bracket? Shouldn't it be higher than that? 

And what records? Cite your sources here. Not a single trans woman has ever so much as medaled at the Olympics despite being eligible for 20 years now.

And YouTube propaganda videos are not a credible source imo.
I didn't. he deleted literally everything after refusing to read the facts we gave him, just like something ben shapiro would do.

i found pics of him ""pre."" Even ""pre"" dude looks like a cis guy to me who grew out a patchy beard for the past 8 years. it wouldn't surprise me if he is, since part of the post seemed like a massive slap in the face  of any real trans person. I'm surprised I haven't seen the guy troll r/ftm, if he's even heard of that sub.

he didn't care about the argument i had that supports him either, so if he's truly trans, this guy either has a screw loose or hates himself like the other trans transphobes. 

He couldn't even give me an unbiased, science based source that proves ""no matter how long"" we take HRT since it's been clinically proven.
First of all this conversation is finished, Secondly you misunderstood  completely the ""trust me bro"". I wasn't telling them to trust me, it was an ironic way of saying that the redditor I was answering had no proof of whatever he was trying to say.
I don't know, do PCOS women grow significantly taller than other women and have significantly more muscle mass? If so, yes they would have advantage. Your logic: ""I want to bend reality because I can't accept biology""
Nah, I'm a trans woman who transitioned a couple years before Caitlyn did, I hate her guts :p I was just pushing back on the idea that being trans is a way to get out of legal trouble
Sometimes puberty delays itself. Your unscientific beliefs probably ignore intersex people altogether, doesn't it? Often times, transgender people are. This could mean the chromosomes are indecisive, mixmatched, they exhibit deemed ""male"" and ""female"" genitals, or the brain fully developed as another gender. Delayed puberty is usually how people find out that they are intersex. More studies may find being trans begins as an intersexuality, since people assigned so at birth have to have the same types of procedures as transgender people, for the same cause — gender dysphoria and various gender identities. The only one who knows them best is God and themselves. Not you. Not some other trans person. Just God and them. People calling Lia a man is sickening for this reason, when she's well aware that she's a woman. Don't like it? Cry and get over it. Why worry? She isn't hurting you is she? :)
Eighteen isn't a magic number, people aren't finished developing until 25 anyway. The point is that the adults can, with more experience than a child, guide that child to ask questions that will make clear what choice is right for them. People don't ""suddenly change"" when they hit 18, all the adults in their lives just failed to properly listen to them until they finally had the autonomy to be themselves.
Yeah that kind of sport is usually fine

Serious injuries at a young age can heal wrong quite easily (I guess apart of healing fast) and they’ve not got the durability of adults

And contact sports that hit the damage can cause micro fissures and lead to brain damage - especially on a brain that’s not finished developing 

Dumb that high school kids play American football
Is the average trans woman taller than the average cis woman? Yes.

Should that difference disqualify them from competition? No.

It's important for us to be honest with ourselves and everyone else. Not deny facts. But still assert that trans women should have every right to participate in these and other sports as women.

I'm worried when people say things like you're saying, where you're trying to say something unrelated ""genetic lottery has far more to do with it"" without addressing head on that sometimes 2 inches difference is what makes the difference between being 5'11"" and uncompetitive and 6'1"" and competitive.

I think a better way to say this is ... women with better early childhood nutrition are on average taller as well. Would you block women with better early childhood nutrition from competition as well? No, you wouldn't, all women should be able to participate.
Don't waste time arguing with transphobes, it'll only drag down your mental health. If they were going to be receptive to facts and science, they wouldn't be here.
Your being a mediocre athlete is irrelevant and brings nothing to the table.
The only ""science"" based thing he tried to use against me was that trans women are ""taller"" then cis women, and that they would weigh differently then cis women... As if thats at all science and reasonable.

Like at that point with those idiotic suggestions, you'd also be saying then cis people who are over 6 ft tall cant compete with people who are less then 6ft tall, or people who weigh 250 pounds couldnt compete with people who weighed 200 pounds because the weight/height difference would be some sort of major advantage... Like height and weight isnt a ""trans"" thing, its a human thing everyone of any gender will come in different heights and weights.. like there are cis women who are legit 7ft tall, and cis men who are only 4ft tall .
Except you're the one who was making claims that trans people have an significant advantage when it comes to sports.. when they scientifically dont and have been shown to actually have a disadvantage. 

And no you werent being ironic, denying science isnt ""being ironic"" it's being a science denying transphobe as you're spouting anti trans dialogue by saying that trans people have an advantage in sports when science doesnt agree with that and actually states the latter.

Sorry, but anyone who denies science and spouts right leaning, disinformation lies like ""trans people having an advantage in sports"" is a transphobe in my book.
can you tell me facts, not stereotypes? the average man is 5'9, I bet most of Lia's team are somewhere around there. Idk, she doesn't look drastically taller or more muscular to me. Maybe in the thighs since women carry their strength there on estrogen. Can't you read? I said this already. I'm gonna block you if I have to keep repeating myself. I gave you experts' debunking. What else do you want?

Statistics? Ok, women can be any height, dude. the tallest is cisgender and 7'7. the tallest trans woman is like a  FOOT shorter (6'8) hahaha. Both are gorgeous feminine looking women who would astonish anyone looking for a model. This is from genetics, not testosterone. 

I may not have had efficient T at birth, but I am taller than 90% of the cis guys I encounter since I am talker than 5'9. I was 5'9 at the age of 14. My mom is 5'6, 2"" over 5'4 and she's cis. Some just are taller. There is only a 5"" size gap between male and female so where I am 6'1.5 to be exact, is the height I'm supposed to be.

Some women can have more muscle mass than some men and not be trans, just athletic with a high metabolism. Some may be hormonally imbalanced (PCOS) like I said, or have other conditions like thyroid conditions or the Eddie Hall one I mentioned. Anyways, like I said, I don't like repeating myself so I am going to block you now. Maybe in the next life, you'll figure it out when you find God gave you the same brain and the default (rather than female) body. Would you fake a smile and learn to accept that, which only ever ends up causing regret, depression, eating disorders, anxiety, anger, frustration, and jealousy like Cait's probably feeling for faking being a guy for quite a while mainly due to society holding her back at the time, way post the effects of testosterone on her peak bone mass and her voice (it's never too late, but it gets harder to see yourself and for others to see you and take you seriously)

Living in the closet, you'll have everyone telling tou how to be that gender assigned at birth, but you fail for years at feeling content, not looking awkward around others, or hiding the obvious fact that you'd be wearing a mask — like someone trying to learn a language.


Even if you're good looking either way, you can be trans. It's not about looks or insecurity about looks or how you sound. It's a subconscious preference you'd hate yourself for ever ignoring, like your sexuality - whether asexual, hetero, homo or bi

And bi rhymes with bye now😘👍😬
[removed]
oh, but it does, because it disproves that we have an inherent advantage. If we did, how would it be \*possible\* for me to be a mediocre athlete by women's standards?

The fact that I exist, disproves your basic premise.
Didn't you read me saying that this conversation was over? byeeee
I'm glad we can agree on one thing. Intersexuality isn't a sexuality, just like the terms used for trans and cis ending in -sexuality. It's just the state of someone's sex rather than gender; these are two different things, which can be used interchangibly. People who wish to undergo a full sex change may identify as ""transsexual"" and since not all transgender people do, many do not use this term and may even find it offensive when labelled that. 

Many people still think trans = gay.
Just no.
It's basic math, man. ON AVARAGE men are stronger. That doesn't mean that ALL men are stronger than ALL of women. The real, dramatic difference in power is most evident when people are trying to optimize themselves to be the best athlete they can, and they dedicate their life for it. Starting with even a 10/15% advantage in that context is HUGE.
Ah yes the famous, transphobe runs away when they've been proven wrong lmao
key word there is \*men\*. Men perform that way because of \*testosterone\*, you know, the exact thing we make a point of getting rid of, and replacing with estrogen.

Fact of the matter is we are \*not\* men, and our bodies do not \*perform\* like men's bodies, because we make a \*point\* of feminizing our bodies. That's kind of what transition \*is\*.

You're trying to cite a group of people that we are not, that have athletic enhancing hormones we don't have, to argue that we can do athletically what they can. In what universe is that remotely a logical argument?

Moreover, since when is having a biological advantage a disqualification for sports anyways? You don't see people banning tall people from the NBA for having an advantage or Michael Phelps being banned from swimming despite having several genetic abnormalities that make him better suited for swimming.

the reality is the entire \*concept\* of sports revolves around biological advantages, and there's no real way around that.

Even if we \*did\* have an advantage (which we don't), people get ahead in sports because of biological advantages all the time and nobody cares. So why do they care with us? Because it's all about being transphobic.

Nobody gives a flying fuck if a cis woman happens to be a she hulk of a woman that what were your words ""towers above the other girls"", but suddenly if we are it's a huge issue? Come on man, just admit it you're transphobic, and the \*only\* reason you're making this argument is because of anti trans bigotry. If a cis woman had the \*exact same\* advantages you're bitching about I guarantee I wouldn't hear a peep out of you.
Girl, are you really thay oblivious? I'm not gonna talk with someone that offends me repeatedly,  tf, get lost."	seopja	trans	731	0.96	2022-01-28 11:29:40
Me 16 (M) misgendered my trans boyfriend (17m) i feel horrible and dont know what to do	 I was talking over audios with him and his friend (thew where together) who happens also to be a trans man his friend and i got really close and now i feel like i lost them both and they hate me. I apologized to them both and i really dont see him as a girl idk it was just a slip up and now they are pissed (rightfully so) but now i really need help can i make it any better	"you correct yourself and move on. these things just happen, even with cis people. putting more attention on it will just make it more awkward for him
I mean, with all respect, and personally knowing how it can feel to be misgendered. If it was an accident, like it sounds, and you didn't have any malicious intent, which it sounds like you don't, and this isn't a common thing from you, which it seems not to be, it's hard to justify them being extremely upset with you. The best thing you can do is apologize, but don't think of yourself as the worst transphobes ever because you made a mistake that literally everyone WILL make. Hell, I misgender myself more often than I like. Happens to the best of us.
There's nothing else to do other than what you've done which was apologize and try to be better. If your boyfriend and his friend hold this against you forever, it honestly is overboard. And I'm trans too and have been misgendered accidentally by a friend too - it really isn't something I would hold a grudge over, and like, as long as I see improvement and genuine sorrow, I would personally forgive and forget it happened.  So this really sounds odd to me if they're both holding onto this as a grudge. But, I also don't know how long ago this happened. How long ago was it?
it's just one slip up, if they act like that over one small honest mistake, that's a little iffy. don't beat yourself up about it
bro i accidentally called my brother she the other day, which makes zero sense. he’s cis and presents hella masc. it was just an accident, no one thought much about it and i corrected myself. it should be the exact same w your boyfriend, if they’re making a big deal out of it they’re overreacting
If you apologized then that’s great. It was a mistake and your are only human. If it’s really eating you up inside (which is a feeling I understand) then you can talk to them. Either face to face or over text or something similar. I suggest face to face. Then just tell them. Tell them how you feel and just get it out. I very much doubt they hate you or think any less of you, but a healthy relationship needs communication, if you assume they hate you and let that fester, the relationship can start to crumble (worst case) 

Just talk to them.
- Don't make a big fuss of messing up, when apologizing.  It can come off patronizing even if not intended that way.

- Take extra care to not misgender in future.

- If you catch yourself, just say ""Ah, sorry."" and correct your words.  It means a lot when someone doesn't need prompting to recognize their mistake, or if they do, they don't show resistance to the prompting.

And remember, the stereotype of trans people being volatile to being genuine accidental misgendering is just that.  A stereotype.  Most trans folks will be upset, but won't rip into you for it if you clearly weren't malicious.

Hell even if someone is malicious, many of us are afraid to be too open in pointing out a slip up.

TL;DR - Don't be too hard on yourself.  The best apology is changed behavior, and excessive-guilt or self-flaggelation won't help you any with that.
I misgendered my spouse in our wedding vows. We still laugh.about it. In fact they have misgendered themselves without thinking. Accidents happen. It is not a sign of anything.
IME - trans folk can usually tell the difference between a genuine accidental misgendering and an intentional misgender.

Both suck and can ruin your day, but the former is infinitely more forgivable and forgettable compared to the latter. I'd suggest, like others - apologise, move on and learn from the mistake.
Word slips happen even among straight people, he will hopefully get over it. I know it hurts but I'm sure he knows that you love him and care
Getting misgendered sucks but it happens. As everyone else has said here, if it was accidental and not a part of a larger pattern, he should move on. You're in the clear. It's pretty obvious that you're not a transphobe, or you wouldn't be reacting like this.  
If this is what breaks the relationship, sorry to say but you most likely dodged a bullet.
As a trans guy, I saw your boyfriend's reaction as very normal, I guess if I was misgendered by my boyfriend or my best friend, I would be very angry with them at first because they are people I can feel like myself with. You kind of destroyed his comfort zone in that moment, but does that make you a bad person? No, it doesn't, after all, due to the norms in the society, every person unintentionally attributes a gender to everything and there may be mistakes, so my advice is, dont go too far on him, you and his relationship may be cold for a while, but as time passes, he will realize that it was just a mistake.
If you made one mistake and they're passed off at you it's a reflection on them not you. Get a better boyfriend you deserve it.
If it is a one time thing and don’t happen too often, I think its fine, just apologize, move on.
When my boyfriend misgendered me at the beginning of our relationship(the one single time he misgendered me), he sat me down and deeply and authentically apologized, and said that he would never do it again, and that he would do anything he could to make it right. I could tell he was sincere, and it meant a lot to me.
Apologise and dont do it again
from another trans guy: accidents happen dude. if you didn’t have any malicious intent, it’s okay. just correct yourself, apologize, and move on. shit happens. :)
if it was a genuine accident and a one-time thing, it doesn't really make sense for them to linger on it for *too* long.
I would never get mad at my friends for misgendering me on accident. I would even go as far to say if a trans person getting pissed at people for genuine mishaps and accidents, then they are the one that needs to get it together. Getting mad and staying mad at people for stuff like this is actually kind of abusive in my book. 

Your going above and beyond by coming here and seeking advice :) dont beat yourself up over this accidents happen, you sound like a genuinely caring person
Mistakes happen. Honestly from what you’ve said and given this isn’t a regular/deliberate thing it sounds to me like the overreacted. All you can do is show you’re making an effort, if they can’t see that they’re the problem, not you.
They are not rightfully pissed at all- people slip up. They would have a right to be pissed if you didn’t just quickly correct yourself and move on. They would have a right to be pissed if you weren’t sorry. They would be right to be pissed if you did it on purpose. They have a right to be hurt by it because that’s uncontrollable, but they don’t have a right to demonise you or punish you for what seems to be a genuine and unfortunate mistake. It happens. They will run out of friends and family very quickly if they simply cut out everyone who hurts them accidentally
We all do it occasionally. It sucks. When someone hounded me for weeks for misgendering them, I apologized right away and attempted to check in. They then complained to all our friends about it and I realized, it wasn’t about me. They were just working out some trauma stuff on me. If your friend is your friend, time will heal it. 
Have compassion for yourself! You too were conditioned by our society. 
When I’m misgendered, and it happens, sometimes it stings a bit but I don’t let it ruin my day, especially when someone immediately apologizes. My gender is only part of my experience here in this life.
Be kind to you, you deserve it!
You gotta prove to him you're gay, he's got to know that you're attracted to men so that's why you're attracted to him 😐
Slips of the tongue happen, it’s the intent that has to matter. If you’re being rude to be rude, misgendering is a problem. If you say she when you intend to say he, or vice versa, that just happens. I’ve called my wife my daughter’s name a hundred times!
i’ve misgendered people on accident before. Just correct yourself and move on.
Mad love for a post about misgendering transmen. I don’t feel it gets enough awareness/attention. Thank you for caring about us :)
It happens, you apologized. Give him some space. Don't harp on how sorry you are, because that will make him feel obligated to tell you it's okay. Do not put him in that position. However it would be really beneficial to ask him directly how he wants you to handle slip ups. My mom has done great, almost never  misgenders me. But I do still have a sister, and a girlfriend, and every once in a while she slips up as parents do, but she doesn't mean it. If it's a genuine mistake just sorry, correct yourself, and move on. Unless he tells you to do something different then absolutely do that, he knows what he needs. Everyone is different, even trans people. Once he's in a place where he's comfortable to talk then seek the answers out from him directly.
If my girlfriend misgendered me, even once, I’d probably be super fucking upset, so I can understand their reaction to some extent. The way I think about it in my mind is if someone truly sees me as a guy, they would never make the mistake of calling me “she” (with the exception of people who knew me before my transition, as they may have called me she for years.)

Ask yourself: why did you slip up? Would you have done that if your boyfriend was cis? Or was there something you perceive as “feminine” about him thy caused the slip-up? If it was the former, you’re fine. If it was the latter, you should do some soul-searching on the way you view your boyfriend.

I agree with the comments about how messing up pronouns shouldn’t be a huge deal if it was an honest mistake and you correct it, but honestly, as far as misgendering goes, I don’t hear a ton of people frequently or even occasionally misgendering cis people.
Apologize
I feel like this is an unpopular opinion on this thread, but your boyfriend and his friend are justified in feeling however they feel. Your intentions have nothing to do with the impact of misgendering, and while I don’t personally react this way when someone does this to me, I think you are centering your feelings as the cis person in this instance. If you care about your partner, give them the space they need to heal and think about this, and be open and willing to be a part of that process in whatever way they need of you. That’s how you show your intentions, not by coming onto a subreddit for trans folks to massage your hurt cis ego.
You obviously feel bad enough to post on reddit about it so you'll eventually get better at gendering them correctly and they'll eventually get over it

It happens. My friends been trans for almost 20 years….I still slip at times…if your ‘friends’ are going to be like that, they aren’t friends. They have to expect it.
if you did it by accident and corrected yourself as well as apologised then you're not in the wrong, you're only human and if they expected you do get it right every single time without fail then they're delusional.
Misgendeeing happens hell I misgender myself sometimes. What's clear is it wasn't intentional and you weren't doing it to be hurtful. You apologized and youre probably going to be more aware going forward. Don't beat yourself up over it it's okay to slip up, we're all humans working to overcome this binary system that was engrained in us since birth.
Just apologize and move on, hon'. It's not the end of the world; we all do it. If he's overreacting, it's probably due to hormonal dissonance of some kind or another (lest we forget y'all are teenagers). You clearly didn't mean it or have any ill intent. If he can see that, he'll come around. 💜
You didn’t commit a grave sin against humankind lol. You slipped. If you slipped and apologized, but they are punishing you by choosing to cold shoulder you or tell you how horrible you are over an accident as small as this that everyone makes from time to time (even us!!) then you are not the problem and they sound exhausting.
If you apologize then they shoudnt be mad
I don’t think they should be mad at you for a slip up. Even my mom switch names between me and my brother. That’s a red flag for me.
If you can’t make a mistake as someone who supports him (and immediate say ‘ oh no man sorry about that’ ) how the f will he navigate the world ?
You apologised, and it's not like it happens all the time, it was a one time slipup. They're understandably hurt, but they shouldn't be resentful. If they actually hate you now, they don't deserve you. Respect the distance they maintain now to cool down, but if they keep hating you, don't let them pull you down with them.
if he came out recently it takes some time to get used to it, even most trans people misgender themselves (like i still do)
If it was an accident and you immediately apologized then they shouldn’t still be angry over it. As a trans person this happens often and if the person is apologetic and it was not on purpose than there is no reason to be upset over it. Your not in the wrong here, the other people seem to be making the situation seem worse than it is, accidents happen.
If it was an accident then it should be fine, as long as they have the maturity to see it as such you have nothing to worry about. I’ve misgendered my partner a couple of times and immediately I apologise and correctly gender them. He understands it’s a new thing for me and the other people in his life. There’s gonna be mistakes made.
just apologize and move on. if he seems a bit insecure, maybe just reassure him
Just apologize tell him your sorry and move on and keep reminding him everyday how much you love him as him a true man because I agree if you keep saying your sorry it will get so much worse over apologizing just doesn’t make him feel weird most likely it backs up how you screwed up so just tell him your sorry move on and remind him of how much u love him  as him
i call cis girls he and cis guys her, i also misgender lots of my trans friends now and then and im trans mtf, its a normal part of talking to use the wrong words and i personally thing its ridiculous that someone would act like that over such a small thing
If they got mad over a mistake they don't Derserve you keep your head up
It's like accidentally calling your teacher ""Mum"". Yes, it's embarassing, and your teacher may be a tad offended, but eventually they'll start to understand it was an honest mistake.
This right here. It took me years to stop misgendering myself in my own head. Slips ups happen, and any remotely reasonable trans person accepts and understands that.

If this is a one time thing and both truly are THAT pissed they have some hyper sensitivity to it that’s not being worked through or there’s more to the story.
Yep. I've misgendered myself and made myself sad. My friend has misgendered herself and then been real sad. Sometimes it hurts to misgender yourself. Other times it's just, huh old habits die hard. 

An occasional slip doesn't feel great but I wouldn't take it as a sign the person is secretly a transphobe that thinks I'm insane. I'd just think they made a mistake. It happens.
it happened like 20 minutes ago and thast why im freaking out
(If he's upset still, he may just need time.  Try to make affirming gestures, rather than offer further apologies.

Dysphoria tends to sting a fair bit, so be his aloe vera.)
Cis people might not get misgendered a lot, but we also aren't cis. I've been out for 10 years and pass pretty well with the exception of some online voice interactions, and sometimes people will let a ""he"" slip out even after they know I'm trans because of it, or just out of habit after knowing me all my life. It doesn't mean they ""need to do some soul searching"" on how they view me or anything, and I'd be an awful person for guilt tripping someone that way when they put in genuine effort to accept and support me because all it does is make people scared to interact with us. In a world where so many people despise us and will go out of their way to misgender us or cause harm in any possible way, it's important to be grateful towards the people who put in effort like that.
20 years and you still can't get it right? Yikes
or saying ""love you"" on the phone to like, a random customer support employee, you were just a bit on autopilot
When I was in a hospital and the night shift came to work a nurse just went from room to room if we need anything. She said good night before leaving... I said it back. Awkward.
I accidentally called my stepmother “mom”. I learned it is impossible to not give the wrong impression in some cases, even if it was a legitimate slip of the tongue and even if you correct yourself.
we’re trans though it’s different. If it was me I would think op sees me as a girl and probably lose all interest in them lol. I know mistakes happen but that’s just how I’d feel 🤷‍♂️
Oh, and maybe you can do something in the next couple days that would be really gender-affirming to your boyfriend. Do you know what helps him with gender affirmation? I'm sure he would really appreciate that :)
Oh ok, then yeah, you just need to give it time and as long as they're reasonable, then with time, they'll realize it was an honest mistake and see you're trying to do better. If they see all that, I'm sure they'll let it go. Just try to be a bit more careful about it and you'll be fine :)
I’m not trying to be ungrateful, but if I was misgendered because of my voice I’d feel pretty damn shitty about it, especially by my intimate partner. I’m not saying OP is a bad person but what’s the harm in analyzing why he made the mistake to better avoid this kind of thing in the future? Especially because he’s literally his boyfriend.
OH GOD STOP IM CRINGING AT BAD MEMORIES AHHH
I legit almost said “love you” to my academic advisors’ wife when she hugged me after a team dinner thingy
as a customer service employee, it’s a little funny but it’s also kinda nice. like, it’s kinda sweet especially when we deal with so many ungrateful customers every day
No, it happens.
Our brains get trained and are biological fixed on voices, body shapes etc, its how it is and simply happend.
My gf did the same to me twice esp during my early transition, she corrected and said sorry.
Knowing that people make mistakes esp in autopilot mode is natural, it isn't like they did it on purpose.
Like a friend of me (she's cis) has a incredibly deep voice, she sometimes gets misgendered over it esp on the phone, it just happens.
Move on from that mistake and don't be mad, be mature and know better, everything else especially when they didn't do it on purpose would just be immature and kinda toxic.
Thats my opinion ofc.
okay thanks
I’ve misgendered my cis sister before so to you that means deep down I don’t really see her as a girl? Trans people are people and sometimes people misgendering us has absolutely nothing to do with us being trans and happens for the same reason they misgender cis people from time to time: brain farts. It’s really not that deep every single time and you will drive yourself mad if you don’t see yourself as a normal person and view everything as a result of your being trans. You are a normal person, so you should expect to be treated as one
That’s adorable
It’s not immature and toxic, it’s the reality of how I’d feel and it’s valid. If they have never known me as female they have no business saying she, point blank.
For me, my voice is deep. I won’t date anybody until I’ve fully transitioned, personal choice. So it doesn’t even apply to me. If my family who have known me most of my life as a girl can manage not to slip up I’d fully expect my partner never to do it. Since they’re supposed to be attracted to me as a male…
I don’t fully pass, so I just think it’s a lot more likely for me personally. I’m not saying brain farts are impossible, but if someone misgenders me it’s not going to be because of a brain fart.

I’m not saying honest slip ups are impossible, but with cis people they’re super uncommon whereas trans people have to deal with a lot more misgendering both intentional and unintentional. I’ve had cis people who repeatedly misgender me blame it on “brain farts” and then continue to misgender me. I’m sure OP really did slip up honestly but if I misgendered my girlfriend I’d give it some very honest though as to why I did that so I can avoid it in the future rather than panicking over her reaction.
Your choice is fine and understandable.
My family couldn't maintain it once, so hey opposite here and you know why, people are different, well in my case it's cuz my family is right-winged but thats a different story, they dont even try lmao, glad yours do though thats beautiful honestly, happy for everyone who has such a family.
But it happens, it even happens to cis-people.
We have a subconscious and a conscious way of thinking and if people run into autopilot it can happen.
Just because someone accidentally slips doesn't mean they aren't attracted to you how you are, they wouldn't be with you if they didn't love you how u are in the first place, it even happens that people don't even notice that they slipped due to the subconscious/conscious thing and it happens all the time, we as trans folks just watch for it a lot more, most just overhear it when they get called the wrong pronouns.
I wouldn't wanna be the partner it happens to when they accidentally misgendered and suddenly the other person goes off on me, I'd prolly be incredibly anxious and slightly traumatised from that mistake even if it was an accident, which happens a lot I've seen a lot pop off and then noticed often that those who got shit on for accidentally misgdering avoiding people like that in the future which is sad cuz they are obviously accepting.
“If someone misgenders me it’s not going to be because of a brain fart” mate, I cannot tell you how untrue that is. I’ve misgendered trans friends who don’t pass very well but, especially being trans myself, I really don’t see them as anything but their true genders, and you can’t tell me I do because that would simply be false. Is it *less* likely to be a brain fart if you don’t pass? Sure, I’d say that’s probably the case. Is it *never* going to be because of a brain fart? No, that’s simply not the case. I promise you that there are lots of people out there who would accept you and recognise you fully regardless of how well you pass. Not everyone is easily swayed by a person’s appearance; they know you at your heart. 

Obviously a pattern of misgendering is a bad sign if a person has been out for a long time (it’s reasonable that it might take people a while to adjust, especially if you don’t pass very well, and that can still be down to brain farts). That’s not the case in OP’s situation. 

I think you have had a hard time and I think you are too hard on yourself if that would be your reaction to accidentally misgendering a partner. My mum has called me my sister’s name before, both pre and post transition. That doesn’t mean she somehow thinks I am my sister, nor does it mean she should spend time analysing why she did it. That’s silly. There is no sense in over-analysing normal human behaviour
We’ll agree to disagree lol
My girlfriend is trans and newly out, so of course I’m going to want to reflect more because I’ve accidentally misgendered her a few times since she came out. I’ve concluded that the few times I’ve done it, it’s because I was recalling a time from before she came out, and because I recognized that, I’ve been better able to avoid that kind of mix up when recalling her past."	xb7fyq	trans	727	0.96	2022-09-11 02:58:18
Hi. Someone on this subreddit misgendered me, then proceeded to say it was because of my haircut. I’ve been distraught ever since. So today I said, “cut it off, make it masculine.” Here we are: Mr. Max hopefully looks more like a Mr.		"Don’t let others bring you down, dress and act the way that makes you happy not others
UPDATE: I actually like my hair, it isn’t that I’m weak minded about the comment that was made. Sure it hurt my feelings, but it wasn’t the defining thing that made me get a haircut. I was going to get it cut anyways but got it to look more masculine and I’m happy with it now. It’s just hair. Also to the person who said “yeah you still look like a f*g”...you know what subreddit this is, right? ///// My own comment is gonna get lost but if you see it just know all y’all’s comments mean a lot to me but I’m socially awkward and can’t keep up lmao I love y’all 😭
Dye it black, smokey eyes, learn green day songs. Punk rock super star billy joe Armstrong (meant as a really good compliment)
Sorry you where misgendered but from what i can see you have deff got the masc vibe down
This should not be a space you have to deal with that and I’m so sorry you had to. I know sometimes it feels impossible but don’t let others get you down! You know who you are and you’re rocking it!
Hello Mr Max. You look very manly today if I might say so! 🙂
I love that shirt mate!
i'm sorry that happened :(

you look so handsome though!!
I like your cut b
Looking good brother! You're looking more masc than I ever did!
Dang, sir, you’re lookin’ fire!
Good lookin, man
Lookin good brother 💜
Your hair reminds me of my son's 😄
You look very handsome Mr. Max! Your hair is so lovely and curly and the colour is beautiful.
You look handsome!!
It's a great look! Sorry you had that happen, here of all places
Def just getting masc and male presenting and passing imo.

Also boo on who misgendered you, hope your feeling less funky!
Well, you most certainly pull it off. Seriously handsome, dude. Sorry you got misremembered though, if you can lead them to me I volunteer to punch them.
Awesome, dude! That haircut really works for you!
100% Mr.
Lowkey thought you had facial hair so I mean you looking like a guy anyway and try not take things to heart only makes things worse if you do
WHICH MOTHERFU-

Dude sidenote you look more masculine than I ever did when I thought I was cis.
You don't look like a Mister.

You ARE a mister.
Very handsome!
I see a dude when I look at your pictures. You look great! 🤩
dude holy fuck them but your hair is awesome!!!!
You look like the protagonist of a web comic I used to read way back when. It’s amazing! I’m sorry you got misgendered. You look great! Very manly!
Dude. Went looking through your post history, you look incredible man!
Dreamy and handsome guy.
What are ya pronouns? 

You look amazing and I don’t wanna misgender you
I think cutting is is a good idea so you dont get misgendered anymore, so i hope youre happy with it!
But why tf does your shirt say “i dont matter” mate r u ok
Men can have long hair. You are valid Mr. max.
You have the masculine look I wish I could pull off, Mr Max. Love the hair color too lol
this is nsfw how?
I dont see no female, i only see a dude, good luck becoming the real man your supposed to be
I’m sorry that that happened to you sir.

Often people treat this subreddit as r/transpassing which it most definitely is not.
You look like a total dude im confused how you could've been misgendered. Also your shirt is dope where'd you get it? 👀
Great picture! Very handsome! I feel like you could pull off a beanie cap really well with those curls!
Ha! Well, I clicked and read at the same time...and wondered why I was looking at a younger picture of [Geoffrey Arend](https://www.google.com/search?q=geoffrey+arend&tbm=isch&ved=2ahUKEwixkM-N4JruAhURmJ4KHWooBTsQ2-cCegQIABAA&oq=geoffrey+arend&gs_lcp=CgNpbWcQAzIICAAQsQMQgwEyBAgAEEMyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADoECCMQJzoFCAAQsQM6BwgAELEDEEM6CggAELEDEIMBEENQtixYlEFgt0FoAHAAeACAAVyIAZMHkgECMTGYAQCgAQGqAQtnd3Mtd2l6LWltZ8ABAQ&sclient=img&ei=jt7_X7GRJpGw-gTq0JTYAw&bih=832&biw=1483&client=safari) with blond hair?

Max, you have a better hair cut than me, that's for sure.
Holy heck dude you look awesome, that haircut actually really suits you! (I’m sure the other haircut looks just as good tho, since you look good in general)
Wow well I looked at the other pics you posted and it's good either way! I wouldn't worry about changing yourself because of one mistake. But you do look great!
Dude I’d just say do what makes you feel good, you look awesome
Sir! You look absolutely great!
You look great man! I hope you are feeling better!
Hi Mr Max!
I’m certainly jealous of how cool your hair is! Looking good sir!
Honestly fuck them for saying your hair defines your gender.
You got it down king don’t even. Live your best life hun.
Look great!

On this topic I think it's really interesting the things we end up doing to transition at we might not have planned on doing beforehand. When I started my transition I had no intention of changing my name despite it being overtly male. But then I realized that everytime I'd meet someone regardless of how I dressed/sounded and they heard my name their brain immediately went ""oh, he's a boy"" would start to he/him me. Over time it made me resent my name a bit which brings us to now where I'm considering changing it.

At first, I really fought this--I didn't want to change myself to make things easier for *other* people--but I've come around to it. If the goal is for the world to perceive you a certain way you just sort of make accommodations to this and, honestly, I don't think it's worth fighting it anymore. If it brings you bliss and alleviates dysphoria it's valid and you should go after it!

TLDR: you look great and I support your decision!
Sorry but you are in fact ftm man I thought you were an androgynous guy getting ready for hrt. You look very Handsome and sharp. Don’t let your self esteem from something like that get down.
Sir, this is a Wendy’s.
Handsome honey pie
Gonna be real with you dude, you look like a guy to me.
Who was it? I just wanna chat.
At least I like it haha, it was pretty long before I suppose 😅
You're handsome as hell, I wish I had your body/face type. Long or short hair, you look masculine af. Don't let others bring you down, I know that's easier said, but do what makes you happy. You look great
I like your shirt, but that seems to give the opposite impression, as you do care about your haircut. Anyway, haircut looks nice

(For non Chinese speakers/readers the shirt says ""I don't care"")
It used to be black haha, but I mean I play drums and guitar but I can’t sing for shit 😂
Thank you haha I wish I knew what it said 😭 I’m probably offending someone lol
He/him 😭💖
Not sure, are admins able to do it?
I’m p sure Forever 21 💖
Sir, this is what it is saying
😂💖
Also, if people ever try to tell you why they misgender you, don't listen. That's an incredibly hard thing for people to actually specify, it's mostly subconscious, so it's probably impossible for them to tell you exactly why. The new haircut looks really good though! Handsome boy.
I never knew what it said before someone told me in the comments, I just knew it was comfortable. 😂
Meh, good enough for me ahaa!
doesn’t matter, if you go into punk rock! no one will hear your singing over the screeching guitars and your angst
As far as I can tell it says ""I don't mind/care/take to heart"". I'm a pretty new at Mandarin, but I know for certain that 我 means I/me and 不 mean not or just negating the next words. My dictionary says 在乎 means depend on or mind/care/take to heart. 

And you look great! Definitely masculine :)
It says ""I don't care"" in Chinese. 
Here are the characters if you want to look it up to confirm: 我不在乎
You look very handsome sir, you’re hairstyle fits you perfectly imo 👈😎👈"	kwodo1	trans	699	0.99	2021-01-13 19:54:00

I know the pain dude. I'm a chick who has the same problem, it's also why I'm dreading Xmas this year.
Happy (early) Birthday Casper! It won't be like this forever. You have many, many birthdays ahead, and the misgendering is certainly temporary!
I know how you feel. My dad says how he thinks I think he doesn’t love me, and then proceeds to give me 100 dollars for my birthday. I don’t want your money. I don’t care what you give me. All I want for Christmas and my birthday is for you to call me your son and to use my name. 🥺😭

Happy birthday dude
Dear Casper,

While we don’t know each other, I would just like to wish you a happy birthday and shower you with all of the platonic love you’d like. I know how hard birthdays can be, especially for people like us. I know it can be extremely difficult to keep up hope, all I can do is promise you that I and many others have your back, and that we love and care about you. Please don’t hesitate to reach out to myself or anyone else (with their permission first of course). I wish I could think of more to say but I’m unfortunately not very good with words or speaking. ❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈🎁

- Kendra
CASPER! HAPPY BIRTHDAY! if I had your phone number and tomorrow weren't Saturday, my class and I would call you. They're a pile of cheerful queer weirdos who'd be so excited. I hope tomorrow is your best birthday yet, sir, and the worst to come.

...actually if you dm me your number my family legit will call and wish you happy birthday. We're a bunch of cheerful queer weirdos too.
Happy birthday 🎁 Casper. I've been on here for a very short time not even a month but I gotta say I've spoken with very cool, encouraging, and sweet folks. Cheer up my man, we're here to help, love, and support you.
Happy birthday, Casper 🥳🎉 I hope you make the most of today ❤
Hey lil dude hope ur birthday goes as well as it can go all things considered! (I see your name is Casper and that’s a dope name! Happy birthday Casper!)
HAPPY BIRTHDAY TO MY FAVOURITE UNKNOWN REDDIT GUY!!!

Happy birthday Casper, don’t worry dude, people can be like that sometimes, if it counts, I wish you the best with your transition, im sure you are a handsome fella!
Happy birthday Casper! I hope you have the best day and eat all the cake your happy heart can take!
IS THAT WHY I DREAD TALKING TO RELATIVES?? holy fuck i'm just realising it rn-
Happy birthday, Casper!
If you've ever used a forum, online service, MMO or something similar where you've entered a a nickname that you later started to hate... imagine this is not any different. Some email's going to call you by a nickname you haven't been using for months or years and you'd like to forget about.

The name you're reading is only a temporary snapshot of your existence. It's a version of you that you have transcended. It used to be part of your history but you've grown and gotten better. 

Sometimes history hurts. Unfortunately, you won't be able to make it go away. Accept that it was there and today, you're different. Only by accepting that this existed and that it's not you anymore you will be able to move on.

It's an old, useless nickname. Nothing more.

Hey Casper! Happy birthday! I'm so proud of you for making it this far, for overcoming all these hurdles, and for living another year. Most of all I'm proud of you for knowing who you are and who you want to be. That's something no one can ever take away from you, no matter the amount of deadnaming, shaming, or legislating people do to try to make you someone else. You are you, and that is something I hope you can celebrate this year even if no one else does. Happy birthday Casper, I hope the next one is even better as more and more people see you as you truly are 💖💖💖
Hey Casper! A friendly name for a friendly guy huh? Your birthday is special to me, because it means you’ve made another cosmic journey around a gigantic ball of plasma while speeding through the universe at unimaginable speeds. Your lap around the sun didn’t end you up where you left off last year. Because as you’ve been spinning and hurdling across existence, our ever expanding galaxy has been chugging along. And yet, another lap has been made, it is an anniversary of another journey. Your journey through your life in a year is similar. You never quite return to the past year with each birthday. You’ve changed a little here and there, as has your world. But, it’s a commemoration of another year of you growing, shrinking, flying, and falling. And goddammit I’m proud of you Casper. Happy birthday big guy, you made it.
Thanks dude. We got this.
We’re all in it together boys and girls, we’re all in it together…
No problem, bro.
Ofc ❤
18th! What about you? Also happy birthday to you too!! :D
Ty! Let’s have a good day today! <3
Np
ohh almost mine is right after yours, happy birthday
❤️😊🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈
Oh, Casper, I'm so so happy to hear that. I hope it heralds a year of growth and joy and learning and peace!
Welcome 😺
thank you!
That's right that's right!💯 Glad everything went well 💪🏾😎
thank you soo much 🥺🥺🤍🤍 i really really appreciate so much more than you know
thank you 🥺🥺 i really appreciate it
You're welcome!
You are so welcome, it's the least I could do 💖"	ri8iab	trans	691	0.99	2021-12-17 04:02:05
Can't believe l'm going to get deadnamed and misgendered at a work Christmas party tomorrow wearing this		"Anyone who looks at you and doesn't see a young woman is deliberately being an ass.
It IS hard to believe considering how gorgeous you are.
i think you’re a beautiful woman! you don’t deserve any disrespect you receive
If it helps you look great and I love your glasses and im proud of you
You gits posting selfies keep giving me gender envy. You all look too good.
I feel like it's a really quick way to look like an ass.
What industry do you work at that has such shit people?
You look beautiful!
You look amazing
Well they're fools then. You're gorgeous and anyone who says otherwise is wrong. Much love~ 💖
I wouldn't believe it either! The people who would do that would need to be absolute jerks to intentionally go out of their way to do that!
Once more y’all are really pretty
Remember it them looking like an ass to everyone. You just keep being your beautiful self.
I wish u luck my fair lady
I have no idea how anyone could misgender you. You look soo cute/fem ❤️
You look very beautiful! No matter what I wear I always get misgendered but my voice does not help with that. Hope all goes well at the party!
""bUt thAt'S oBvIoUsLy a hE hIm!"" no you look femme af stay strong champ! 🙌❤
Red lipstick will cut that
If people misgender you, just act like they’re being dumb. Because they are. It’s really fucking obvious you’re a woman, and anyone who says otherwise needs to touch grass.
OMG you are so pretty!
you look amazing.
That is so beautiful, you look amazing! 😍
Don't worry about it you are absolutely beautiful the way you are,just believe in yourself and you will be fine.have you found a new name for yourself yet?
That awesome, you very beautiful, you should be proud of yourself how far you came
You look amazing!! aaaaaaaaaa the envy
Oh the confidence, I wish I had that
You look great!
I feel like I would just start miss gender then back and when they get offended tell them yeah doesn’t feel nice does it so use my preferred pronouns or I’ll make this an hr issue. Btw you look amazing!
Holy shit I’m so jealous of your hair your face you r jacket your nails your…

aaaaaa why couldn’t I have been born fem 😭
If someone sees you and deadnames and misgenders you then their being a dickhead. Yoh look really good, where did you get your dress if I can ask?
Just tell them your real name and let HR know if they don’t
I love your style in this outfit.

You really are super pretty...and within a year or two the same people will be begging for it...utterly clueless...and you can't care about cruel careless people.
I’m sorry like I really and I also have that same dress
You look gorgeous. I feel with you, currently on my way to my mom. I'm not gonna hear my real name in a while.
Ciao
The guys are jealous cause their friends will make fun of them for being attracted to a beautiful woman and the women are jealous of your beauty so try to deny your gender so they don't feel like you're a threat to their boyfriends
Thanks for the outfit inspiration. You look fire🔥
Just enjoy yourself you look great
Disrespectful people... Honey don't listen to them you are perfect just the way you are. I get deadnamed and misgendered alot too by family. Im ftm.
I mean if you want them to call you by a preferred name and pronouns just tell them…
Well why not ask them to respect ur name and pro nouns
Isekai?
Holy fuck you look amazing!🙌
That outfit is cute as hell
 How tf do they confuse u, also fuck Ohio. Got into a physical fight cause someone decided to be a dick to my GF about her gender as if it's any of their business.
GO ON A DATE WITH ME OMG
You look so pretty in that (and in everything I assume) whoever doesn't get that your beautiful needs to fuck right off. Deadnaming sucks and needs to stop. Period
Love the fit sis! You are so precious!
If it’s intentional, they clearly have dementia😊
If I saw you there id never think you would be something other than a young woman
Anyone who sees you as anything but a women is a fuckwad asshole trying to a sadistic piece of shit. Because you look lovely and gorgeous you're making me jealous as fuck and they're prob doing it because their jealous or their insecure because of how God damn good you look. BOOM TRUTH.
Totally agree. She’s super cute!
Car dealership
Yes of course. I am a year on hrt and currently saving money to legally change my name
This is generally a bad idea, because their logic behind that is ""if you can do it to me why can't do it to you"" it doesn't help get the point across it only makes it worse.
I mean I am mtf trans, so I wasn't either
I got the dress from SheIn ☺️
They know my name
The other women here all call me correctly, and three of the men have hit me up to come over to their place. And more of them keep checking me out as I walk by
The dress is from SheIn!
I have
Most people don't respect that, even in the workplace where it is illegal not to.
I have
I’m going to assume in a very red state?
I guess fair enough I just don’t take people who can’t respect me lightly. I’ll gladly be as petty or make a permanent memory not to fuck with me. Idk maybe it’s the way I was raised I hope they learn to respect you.
Girl I feel you 😞 

At least you look super fem in this photo though!
Well that's just a show of how good you look and how well you pass
If it's the first time you are presenting yourself like this, wear a nametag that says ""Hi, I am [name]"" and right under that, your preferred Pronouns. You can't stop assholes being assholes, but you can mitigate circumstances.
Well I suggest ignoring anyone who doesn’t and dont acknowledge them until they get it right
Ohio, it's weird here. But 95% of the people here are republicans
Ohio politically seems to be turning into the texas of the north /: but to your original post, i once read a great piece of advice on what to do if someone says a sexist joke in a group of people, just play dumb, and ask them to explain it in detail, forcing them to eat their words stumbling to explain the humor in something that’s not funny. Maybe if a coworker deadnames you or uses the wrong pronouns, try something similar? Reply back to a male coworker with a completely wrong female name and pronouns? Or put them on the spot and have them casually explain why it is they have so much trouble respecting your wishes on name/pronouns? May work, may not, could get you ostracized or fired? But at some point, you have to put your own self respect first. Just some food for thought? Good luck regardless, you look great.
> Reply back to a male coworker with a completely wrong female name and pronouns?

This is generally a bad idea, because their logic behind that is ""if you can do it to me why can't I do it to you"" it doesn't help get the point across it only makes it worse.

They all know I respond to my deadname at work though so the acting like I don't know thing isn't going to work unfortunately. Maybe I'll just drink enough and stand up for myself
You do you girl, wishing you all the best ❤️"	zntjg6	trans	676	1.0	2022-12-17 00:25:12
My gay coworker is being transphobic towards me but im cis..	"Im really not sure if this belongs here but im absolutely blown away by this situation and id like to ask you all for advice. 
I know my experience isnt even close to what some of you may deal with on regular but id be lying if i said this didnt hurt me for some reason.

My gay coworker called me a ""tr4nny"" Bitch  and started talking about how i dont even pass, im busted, get a better wig ect after he thought my sarcasm was me actually being sassy with him ...
We had never fought before but i guess hes been holding all of this inside and it shocked me for a few reasons, 

1). He's a part of the community...how can he be openly transphobic and gay? Is this a common occurrence...it just doesnt make sense to me 

2). It turns out The whole workplace thought i was trans and theyve been talking about it in secret the entire time.
Im just tall for a women (6 foot) and i have broader shoulders that i got from my father. 
Im also on the muscular side but to me that never dictated my femininity...its just how my body looks but ive gotten this suspicion a few times..

Am i an asshole for being upset? I dont think theres anything wrong with being T or being associated with the label but the constant misgendering and slurs are starting to hurt and how someone could be that ugly towards someone they thought had transitioned. 

I cant imagine being that coldhearted to say something like that to someones face."	"Cis women tend to get harmed by transphobia a lot. There are more cases of cis women being thrown out of or harassed in womens bathrooms by transphobes than trans women, for example. They just get so focused on the ""You can always tell"" lie that they focus in on common traits in afab people and claim only trans women would have those.
Your gay coworker is engaging in classic hostile workplace harassment there. If your company is big enough for an HR department, file a complaint.
Sadly it's not that uncommon for gay cis people, especially gay men, to be transphobic af. I think at least for some it has to do with appealing to cishet people more by ""being on their side"" and hating on trans people, so they're more accepted. It really fucking sucks and I'm sorry you have to deal with being misgendered and having slurs thrown at you, no one deserves it, no matter if they're cis or trans, constantly having to deal with that hurts either way.
Hi! Even if you aren't trans, you did just experience something really shitty. And I'm really sorry for that, no one deserves this. 

To me, it doesn't sound like you're an a-hole for being upset. They're saying all of that stuff from a place of hatred towards you, even if they're wrong about it (transphobics are sometimes too stupid lmao), so of course it'll hurt. Because that's their intention. And because they're calling you something you're simply not.

Anyway, hope you can deal with that bullsh-- soon. Hope they get fired or something.
Sadly I don't think your experience is as uncommon as you would think. Transmisogyny absolutely harms cis women all the time. Some transphobes are so obsessed with clocking us that they'll hurl accusations at cis women that they think have features that ""give us away"". I'm really sorry you have to go through this. 

It makes perfect sense that you're hurt, whether you're actually part of the target group or not slurs are violent and hurtful. I don't know where you work but if possible you should go to HR, threaten to sue so they're forced to take you seriously, sometimes that's the only language HR speaks. If that's not an option get out. That workplace isn't safe for you. Not actually being trans doesn't mean anything to people like this. Stay safe. ❤️
It may Sound Homophobic from my side but hear me out.
I met quite a few Gay Folks before i came out as Trans since im mostl Attracted to Men.
And i did notice that like 80% of the Gays ive met, were the most Arrogant, Unfriendly, Narcistic, Bitchiest(Bitchy as in Arsehole behavior) and Fake Persons i ever met.
Im not sure why, maybe i just had very bad luck.
But these kind of People tend to ""scan"" for possible Insecurities of other People and then attack/harras them with it.
Just to appear High and Mighty or whatever reason they may have, and they really seem to have something against us Transfolks a lot of times.
I just want to say again i dont think that ALL Gay Folks are like this, THIS is just MY personal experience sadly.

I guess he just does that to ""destroy"" a potential thread of someone the Men around could be more interessted in as in him
To be fair many Men nowadays seem to love Tall Woman, maybe hes just afraid cuz your prettier maybe.
Women come in all shapes and sizes! It's a shame shitty people are shitty but you can find them in all communities for all the usual reasons. I'm sorry you're taking flack as an innocent victim of transphobia and the terf wars. No you are not wrong to be upset. They are the ones being ignorant and rude. Don't let them gaslight you!

The biggest cause of transphobia is right wing politicians and right wing media platforming and monitising hate. Cis women and trans women are both victims of their misogyny and anti-social attitudes.
Yeah the trans community gets a lot of hate for seemingly no reason! It really bothers me that people can’t leave us alone and just let us live our lives! We’re not bothering anyone but people love to hate!
Record this motherfucker talking shit and get they ass fired fuck em
He is definitely part of ""LGB"" community. Maybe you didn't heard of this one, so quick explanation. These are just not-straight people, who doesn't want not-cis people in LGBTQ+ community. Why? Because we ""confuse"" them. Yes, they unfortunately exists. I just don't get why he thought you're trans. This is concerning tho.
that uh... that ain't it chief. We've reached a level of ignorance where cis women apparently aren't women anymore. We're goin' full circle it seems.
Nono „they can always tell“ guess they just know something you don’t 😅

Seriously though, even if directed at cis people that’s harassment, file a complaint. 

And yeah it doesn’t make sense and yeah that happens more often than you think. 

Very sorry you had this happen 💕
Nobody should be cast out like this
About number 1: cis gay people tend to be even more transphobic than cis straight people. A big reason is because they tie their sexuality so heavily to genitalia
only one way to make this stop - ~~leave a bloody tampon on his des~~k talk to HR
I'm sorry to hear about this, you have every right to be upset.. the fact that everyone would talk about you in secret is beyond disgraceful. 

His words could put someone over the edge if they were struggling, it's really disgusting. I don't know if you like your job or what opportunities you have but the environment sounds so emotional taxing and draining

Goodluck with everything
you know you are in an interesting position as an ally to trans folks. you have an opportunity to file a complaint, and set a precedent for a zero tolerance policy on transphobic harassment at your work, potentially making it a better place to work actual trans women. lol silver lining.

this guy is a fucking creep. gays can be like this.
I'll just add to all the above, you are not in the wrong for being upset! This is super shitty.
I'm sorry to hear what you're going through at your workplace and whether cis or trans having co-workers thinking that they can engage in sexual harrassment, which includes intentional misgendering and using a name that is specifically opposite gendered(such as a dead name or in your case a stereotypically masculine name). This does cross that line with your co-worker so I would warn him that if he doesn't stop, you'll escalate it, whether through HR or the EOCC process.

To your first point, unfortunately there are gay people who are transphobic and it sometimes comes as a shock to people not immediately engaged with the larger LGBT community or even the in the trans community but there are issues with transphobia and homophobia/biphobia even in these spaces even from people who are  represented by one of the letters. We often like other people carry our traumas and sometimes project those insecurities onto others in our community. We're also not a monolith, but individual people with varying beliefs and prejudices that happen to be share either sexual orientation and/or gender identity with one another.

To you second point, unfortunately cis women who don't fit the fairly narrow idea of womanhood with regard to society's stereotypes, particularly with regard to physical appearance, tend to get lumped into trans woman stereotypes instead. If not trans women stereotypes, it's lesbian stereotypes.

There have been people solely based on cis women's height or body type engage in open transphobia against them. God help them if they have PCOS or something else that causes hirsutism or increased body and facial hair.  The fact of the matter is both cis and trans women come in many shapes and sizes. Furthermore transphobia, particularly the gender policing and doubling down on those very specific, often times very difficult to achieve ideal of womanhood and femininity hurts cis women in as much as it harms trans woman. It's all unfortunate.

With that said you are justified to be upset because your co-worker is sexually harassing you and that is not okay and you shouldn't have to work in that environment. You don't have to stand for their behavior and there are avenues that you can go down to get them to stop.

I wish you the best of luck with dealing with your co-worker and hopefully this was helpful as well informative.
I haven't read all the comments yet but I just want you to know it's totally normal and valid for you to be hurt by this. Trans people are hurt by misgendering, and Cis people can be too. This situation sucks super bad and I'm sorry you're going through it. I don't know what you could do to fix it, but I just want you to know that it seems like you're doing everything perfectly, and it's completely rational for you to feel hurt
Youd be surprised at how many gay people are extremely transphobic to a really hardcore point
Sadly, I've experienced some serious transphobia from cis gay men before. Him being gay in no way gives him permission to be transphobic.

This is actually the kind of thing I find myself telling the girls here about a lot. People are trying so hard to clock trans women, but it's honestly harder to realize than they seem to get... so they just go after any woman that's like, tall, or has a deep voice. 

But we're so rare, they're going to get false positives on cis people more often then not. I see this kind of thing happen a depressing amount. It's why I'm always so insistent ""TERFs"" aren't feminist. They just go around harassing women, even if you only count the cis ones... I'm sorry you had to go through this.
1) yes its sadly common for cis members to be trans phobic, usually more trans phobic than cishets.

They basically are sexist and transphobic in the same throw. Thinking someone must be trans to be a tall bigger girl, is just wrong. No one should never assume someone's agab or gender overall, and I am sorry for you, its valid feeling bad since they disrespect your gender
Imagine being so anti trans that you attack cis people who don't match your idea of what they should look like
I’ve had several gay people be transphobic towards me. It’s much more common than you’d think.
I have a friend that is trans but homophobic and it makes as little sense to me as being gay and transphobic. I have a similar predicament except people often don’t realize i’m a trans women because I “look too masculine”. This means i’m pulling out my id every time i use the washroom.
You’re right to be upset this is sexual harassment. 

Document everything, dates, specific comments etc. Reach out to HR via email, BCC your personal email, so you have an additional copy. Save all responses. Any in person conversations with HR follow up with an email like “we met today, XX/XX/XXX, to discus…. Your response was…. Please confirm this is an accurate representation of our meeting” 

If HR does not act or retaliates against you and you are in the US reach out to your state anti-discrimination agency or the EEOC. If you want a lawyer, the local bar association should have a referral number. You do not need a lawyer to file but it can be helpful.
That is so scary. At my last job, I found out months after I'd start that my coworkers were talking behind my back about me being Trans. Thing is?? I pass on a daily basis. I've literally lived with a transphobic drunk and he never once even got suspicious, he was more sus of me being a lesbian since I never brought a guy around and ignored his creepy advances lol. I'm really not sure what tipped all my coworkers off 🤷‍♀️

But I've since quit that job, the entire place was a very toxic environment.
Unfortunately a lot of gays are transphobic even though they are in the same lgbt+ community as trans, I’ve witnessed transphobia from gay men, lesbians, and straight/ bi people. Some people are just arseholes and small minded, but fortunately we’re not all like that, there are people who are more open minded and nice.

But you definitely shouldn’t take any of this abuse from your gay co worker or anyone else, makes no difference weather you’re cis or trans, you have the right to go about your job with being verbally abused, I would definitely report it to someone higher, HR or something, don’t stand for it.
Oh gay men and women can be some of the cruelest transphobes. They enter the queer community, claim our existence is homophobic, and try to push us out of our own spaces leaving us with nothing. A cis bigot will call me slurs, scream at me, get in trouble for transphobia, but a gay bigot will try to make me feel I don't belong *anywhere* with *anyone* and people hear what he says and thinks ""well he's gay, he probably has a point, i guess gay people also need to be protected from the evil trans people trying to have sex with them""
First, sadly it's really common for other queer folk to be transphobic. Second, you have every right to be upset, because when he says that, it's meant to imply that trans women are just men, and by extention trying to tell you you're a man. Part of being trans is knowing that you are not what everyone says you are. And you aren't Any more or less of a man than any trans woman. Being misgendered sucks as a trans person, and I imagine it isn't very fun as a cis person.
Transphobia hurts everyone. You should talk to your hr dept.
It's still transphobic abuse, even if he is mistaken about you, and it is still harassment. I'm sorry this is happening <3
So generally in this case while I know you aren’t trans you have to do what we do when things like this happen: go to management —> HR next if management doesn’t do anything. The equality act was passed so even if they want to pretend you are trans to try and punish you it would be a lawsuit since you can prove harassment. 

Do you think that your boss would be on your side in this scenario? If not then straight to HR anonymous if you need and if not then go above them based on what the order is for going to the next level for complaints.
It's unfortunate that happened but if you are cis you have no right to say the T slur. No matter whether it's censored or not
Yes, gay men and gay women can be and often are transphobic.  To me they are less likely to be transphobic than hetero people, but it’s still not at all uncommon.

You are not the asshole.  Not at all.  They are.  100% they are.  I’m sorry they’re misgendering you and slandering you because of that.
1. You would think that everybody under the LGBTQIA+ umbrella would naturally have empathy for everybody else under the umbrella. But alas, there's a lot who would happily shit on anybody who isn't their same letter of the rainbow.
2. I'm sorry they're doing that to you.

You're not an asshole for being upset. They're aiming hate-speech at you, even if they're aiming at the wrong target.

The only retort I can think of is ""Well, I'm *not* trans, but god! If this is how you would treat trans people, you should be ashamed of yourselves!""
a lot of cis male gays, especially white ones, are actually surprisingly xenophobic, transphobia and racism being the main offenders. you’re obviously not an asshole for being upset, you were called a slur, even if that slur doesn’t apply to you
God I'm sorry but wow, hilarious. TERFS and twats will tell us how we are clockable no matter what, then fuckin tell cis people that they're trans.

I actually thought about this a while ago. If I ever end up in a situation like this, where someone is violently transphobic and aggressively insisting  I'm trans, I'll just tell them how I was born with an estrogen deficiency. ""Yeah, my mom smoked when I was in the womb and it fucked up my hormones. They couldn't figure out what was wrong with me and didn't want to experiment with hormones on a baby. I only began taking estrogen recently, the many of the effects of the testosterone will still be visible for a while..."" shit like that
You're not wrong to be upset, it's never wrong to be upset if you understand the situation clearly first. I mean....what you experienced is....similar? To being misgendered? Someone is trying to spread false info about you, that's never fun. Cis, trans, male or female, those things are what make you 'you' 

Being queer doesn't prevent you from being transohobic, or stupid, sadly. This community has pos' just like every other, but it's an especially low blow coming from them, even worse then if a cishet person had acted like that. 

Report that shithead to whoever you report these things to, get them fired. Also shame on your coworkers for talking about you behind your back like that.
Not an asshole  for being upset!!!, your gay coworker is mobing you, you should call HHRR, file a complaint!!, second what an asshole, as a trans women i will suffer a lot with this comments, I cannot believe his say that to any women, that guy should be fired openly. He is being misogynistic. You my dear do not deserve that. You have all our support!! you have all the right to be angry!!. HHRR should do something!!, I can bet you are gorgeous to, that is only envy of some kind that guy have thowards you…, 6 ft is model height!!
Talk to HR, this is workplace harassment. And it is perfectly reasonable for you to get upset about this, I'm getting upset just reading it. 

Unfortunately, there's plenty of bigots in the community, just look at how bisexuals are sometime not accepted in the community for some reason. Some people are assholes and that trait transcends sexuality, gender and anything else unfortunately.

It is also not uncommon for people in the lgbtq+ community who are more accepted in society (for ex. gay guys) to turn on and attack less accepted members of the community (for ex. trans people). It's like pick me girls, they trash others in the community hoping that the bigots will accept them more for it. They don't realize they are hurting the community at large, and thus themselves. 

I'm very sorry for your situation, I hope it will get better soon. Honestly all your coworkers sound like absolute assholes.
It’s definitely covered by HR and the equality act if your in the UK. 
They are treating you negatively due to a perceived idea about your gender identity. It could even be seen as sex discrimination as they are treating you different because of a perceived idea of your sex.
Basically even without those, there’s still the instance of bullying and harassment of them calling you and also their admittance that “the whole workplace” have been discussing you in a negative way. 
Honestly, I’d push this all the way to a workplace tribunal tbh.
Are you an asshole for being called a bitch, of any description, at work?

No. I wouldn't think so...
You definitely aren’t an asshole for being upset, cuz you’re not upset at the thought of someone thinking your trans, but in suffering the marginalization of trans people even though you’re cis. Gay people can be REALLY transphobic (there’s even a thing called LGB Alliance, that’s literally LGB transphobic people). It sucks. But I hope you can do something about it, cuz this was straight up harassment
no. you’re not an asshole for being upset. a lot of cis people roll with the “you can tell” lie and it harms a lot of cis people who don’t look stereotypically male or female. also, it is very common that people in the lgbtq community have prejudices against other members. it’s extremely common. i know several gay guys who think trans men are just women. i’m sorry you went through this
Being gay doesn't preclude people from being asshole.

My mtf wife used to be in the gay community before coming out and she had a lot of horror stories to share, it was pretty bad.
Hurt people ....hurt people!
you’re feelings are definitely valid and the trans community should be very understanding of them
Does your workplace have policies protecting gender identity? Does your state / province / geographical area? I'd contact your local department of labor or equivalent organization. This is workplace harassment.
You're not an asshole for being upset.  You just have empathy, and he was attacking you.

Also, that's sexual harassment, btw.  You should deal with it through HR or a lawyer.

This is also an example of transmisogyny, and it's not unheard of for cis gay/lesbians to be like this.  On the lesbian side it's the TERFs, and on the gay side it's just people like your coworker.
Unfortunately I was the same way. I used to suspect any woman who did not meet expectations of womanhood of being trans, including a girl at my school because she played soccer. Thankfully I abandoned my bigoted ways  and now I am here in this wonderful community
My best and only friend of 3 years is gay, and very occasionally i would mention a struggle of mine being trans. A few months ago I was tired of him introducing me to people as a girl, so i asked him to please stop and he told me that this entire time I've been making him really uncomfy, and that he will only call me a guy if say that i want to be trans, because he thinks its a choice and if i dont like the fact im trans theres no point for him to call me a guy. I think thats a controversy in the lgbt community, how sexual identity is very different from gender identity, and ive been told a lot that trans people should have their own community because they are different than sexual orientation. It feels like its more accepting to be gay, while people still dont understand or agree with being trans
Not only are you not the asshole, you have plenty of cause to get them in some serious trouble. And yes. It is of course valid to be upset by someone using transphobic slurs against you even if you’re not trans. Same as me not taking kindly to being called the r-slur even though I am not (as far as I know) neurodivergent in any way, or being called the f-slur even though I’m asexual. It’s still hostile workplace harassment.
I would say her other coworkers are too since they have also been talking about her alleged ""trans identity"" behind her back. If she were actually trans, outing her snd speculating about her behind her back could put her in a lot of danger.

So yeah, OP file a complaint with HR. Sexual harassment is defined as harassment based off PERCIEVED sexual or gender identity--so even if you aren't transgender it's still considered harassment and it is still against the law
Reminder that HR is not there to help individual employees. It exists to help the company. Filing a complaint may result in OP being terminated or forced to quit.
Not to mention in the US transphobic harassment is covered under the civil rights act thanks to the Bostock Supreme Court decision. Even if you’re cis, people using transphobic slurs to insult you and create a hostile work environment absolutely counts. Go above HR’s head and get your bag OP.
Because it’s the combination of toxic masculinity overlaid with their idea of bitchy feminity. It makes for a really toxic and nasty type of gay man. It’s like the nastiness of patriarchy uninhibited.
Ngl for a while the one openly gay person I knew at school was like that, they were a bad enough role model for the queer community that it probably was one of the things that delayed me being comfortable with being openly bi let alone my egg cracking.
I'm a cis gay man and I'm offended
If you cut your sentence at but and it’s bigoted, then there’s no need to continue because it’s just a defense of bigotry. Not to mention the dehumanization of calling gay people the Gays….in a comment stereotyping them about your limited experience….
We are over penis and vag, we can keep what we have or get a neo version, we can grow characteristics of the oposite sex, we are the oposite sex, that for a world in which penis controls society, is very revolutionary, some of us just quitting having one on purpose, or having it but working in a feminine way, or getting one. Our existence proves that there is no one special , nothin special about being a man or being a woman. And that defies the order imposed by the “elders” , the idea of gender didn’t disturb anyone till trans took control and define them self, cause we have an inner locus of control instead of an external locus of control, we are feared. We are outlaws of an unspoken law. Thats why we fascinate and scare at the same time. We are the proof that the myth of paradise is false. That religion is wrong, that morality can be unethical. We are the case that show the “pure” they’re stain’s , the Christian hom much of a farisean is… how they them selves would have condemn christ to the cross. Our existence defies the double standard, and that cognitive dissonance we create on the one that swear they are pure. Just show them that eather they whole believe is false or they are not pure. So yes we are a revolutionary force only by existing. We are revolution cause we do not conform, we are strong cause we are unbroken. We are the thing they fear…. Cause they cannot understand.
Basically, according to bigots, any woman who is 6 ft or taller or have muscles are trans
That hasn't been my experience at all. Particularly, all the people in the WLW community I've met have been very accepting and inclusive. Most gay men have been as well.
Bigger power move. Pull it out right in front of him. Or maybe just go to HR
Love it🤣
She just mentioned what the coworker called her. Get off your high horse. It's not like she used it to refer to anyone in whatever way.
This is a dumb fuckin take. They censored it and weren’t referring to people.
It still puts her in danger even though she's cis, maybe she doesn't realize, but she's as likely as a trans woman to be working with a creep who will see this gossip as reason enough to show how much of a creep they actually are
HR make sure the company isn't responsible for anything that can damage them so no generally they will protect the individual so they don't get sued for a hostile work environment and I'm sure a cis woman being harassed as a trans woman is hostile and no court would see it otherwise.
That’s why OP needs to have the reports filed via email, any in person conversations should be followed up with an email. If HR fired her and she had evidence it was related to her complaint, it would be retaliation and honestly worse than just one worse than one employee participating in sexual harassment. If OP reaches out to HR and nothing happens OP should reach out to the state anti-discrimination department or the EEOC. 

HR protects the company but it’s much safer to fire the sexual harasser than the complainant.
HR is there to protect the company, which is why they generally take harassment complaints seriously. It protects the company from a lawsuit. I do agree with others in this thread that you need to document everything. File the complaint in writing and save a copy / via email (and BCC the email to a non-company account you'll always have access to). Write down every instance of harassment, what happened, when, who was involved, what was said, ect.
i felt in the US that it was kinda that there was this stereotype of gays from bad media representation in the 60s/70s/early 80s, and somehow people after discovering they were gay or coming out of the closet, internalized these media tropes and somehow thought that to be ""valid"" they had to act that way.

kinda same how two friends of mine, the day after they came out started talking with a lisp... i'm like ""okay, Bob, talk how you want, but yesterday you didn't have a lisp.  you can talk different if you want, but you don't need to conform to anything""

also, in some of the other countries where i live, gays act... pretty much the same as straight guys.  only difference is being attracted to men.  (which is kinda what one would expect... gay men are men, right?)
Making memory …. You kind of described like 60% of the ones i know…
The Last of Who?

There's a trans character and everyone was being a bigot to a cis woman lol. Transphobes are morons.
Honestly, it just depend where you live
That was a bit aggressive dude I literally just asked her not to use slurs she doesn't 'fit' into. It's still a slur
She didn’t use it. She censored it in parentheses saying what they called her. And you’re damn right I’m being aggressive. This person was harassed and you Pearl clutch rather than show support for someone who was harmed by transphobia regardless of if they were actually trans.
I'm not gonna sit here and act okay that a cis person said a slur that I and many others have been bullied or harassed with for our whole lives. It is not a nice thing to be reminded of my past experience with bullying. I don't care if she censored it, she said it and I'm not okay with that
No she fuckin didn’t. A cis guy said it to her. She was insulted with it. There is a reason you are getting downvoted. You aren’t speaking for the people here. She isn’t using the word, she is saying what was said against her and censoring it anyways. If you are going to be mad, be mad at the cis man who said it against her.
I am mad at the cis man but she literally said the word you can't bloody deny that unless you can't read . A slur is a slur no matter the context.
She censored it while conveying information that that was the word said to her while simultaneously not actually saying it herself. I’m not continuing this with you, your position is petty and a distraction from the toxicity that was directed towards her. You are being more harmful than not. That is why you are the bottom of most controversial on this post."	ssplel	trans	670	0.99	2022-02-15 00:30:51
I hate people sometimes	"Hey everyone, my first time venting on here, haha.

So, I often have to call the employment office and they \*always\* misgender me even though they always check their records of me during our calls, their records clearly state \*that I'm a 22 year old male\*, but they still misgender me.

Today was worse though, the man talking to me misgendered me, I corrected him, he continued misgendering for what felt like eternity but was only 5 minutes. Even though he checked the records as well, the same records that tell them I'm a damn male.

So yes, I do hate people sometimes. :)

And no, I'm not looking for voice tips, I'm looking for people to start accepting that even males can have feminine voices. I once met a cisgender man who had an absolutely thin and feminine voice, it did not make him any less of a man. This is literally something that can happen to anyone, so I don't get why people must make such assumptions, especially when their records state the person's gender."	"When you call next, at the end of the interaction ask for their name/employee ID/that call's ID, so if you correct them and they continue to misgender you, you can report it. I'm so sorry this happened to you :(
Believe it or not, I have been on HRT 10 years and have a deep voice but will still be misgendered on the phone. 

Phones are just stupid. Half the time I can’t even hear what they are saying. 

But I do get the part about, if they read ‘Male’ then they should address as so. However, I do want to to point out, that just because that stuff is in your employment records, its not always on the screens that need to be looked up. And unless its something that is relevant (like in healthcare) most will completely ignore the gender marker because they are looking to make sure name, DOB, SSN, etc match. 

If you correct them, especially more than once, tell then flat out they are being disrespectful and you wish to speak to management or someone who will address you correctly. 

Sadly, you will continue to run into things even when all your legal documents state male. Some insurances won’t pay for procedures unless its marked female, and them sometime you might have forms like at obgyns that specifically ask sex assigned at birth (ugh). 

Not saying any of that is right. Just saying to help prepare you for the longevity of it all. :(

I hope you soon won’t have to call the unemployment office at all and are able to find a job! Nobody wants to deal with their BS anyways. (They screwed me and want $$ back).

Anyway, 
Fighting!
Fkn Medicaid has been doing the same thing to me 🙃
misgender back. assert dominance /hj
I'm so sorry that happened, that's really shitty of him. You should report him
I totally agree with you. I need to train my voice because I need to be safe not because I want to. I actually came to learn to like my voice. Deep and commanding if I want to or a shrill and annoying usually because I talk fast and I run out of birth. 

There is a part of me that feels that transition as a concept screws us horrible because it just another bill of stuff we must conform to in order to be accepted and stay safe. I have more extensive thoughts on that one, but I don't feel that have a place in a comment under a post to tell you you are simply absolutely fucking right to get angry and hate people sometimes.
Yeah, I mean mostly people can guess right, but not 100% of the time! Not for cis people!

There’s that one cis woman actor who has an incredibly low voice, lower than countless cis men.

And the opposite is obviously true too. And she is an ACTOR for crying out loud.
Tell them your balls never dropped and you're very sensitive about it as well as your voice. This is a real medical problem(idr the name, but it results in surgery typically), also it's not untrue either.
This is blatant poor customer service skills, ask to speak to their manager about their continued problem being able to correctly gender you after being corrected.
Ya know what? 

I do too
I would have started calling him ma'am he'd probably get real heated after that
Some people are just dumb. One thing you could do here - don't pay attention. They will stay dumb anyway and you will be upset. So, think about it.
Misgender them and say ""oh, I thought it was opposites day since you kept referring to me as a woman"".
Maybe try misgendering them right back?
Thank you so much for that, that will definitely help with this situation in the future. I'll definitely report him if this happens again, I sorta memorized his voice already so I can recognize it.   
It's fine, it happens quite often, but thank you so much either way. :)
The whole idea of like… Doctors should be able to just order whatever procedures make sense, without some stupid insurance worrying about a gender marker 🤦🏻‍♀️
I'm so sorry to hear that, that sucks so much.

I agree 100%, especially considering I have a bad hearing, most of the time communication is difficult via this way. 

Exactly. That's also quite true. Yes, you're most definitely right, but their records also show my profile photo - which is pretty damn manly and professional, I look like a young manager (I was wearing a white shirt and a black tie, haha).

Yes, I'm definitely going to attempt to be doing that in the future to avoid stresses like these. 

In my country it's not common for those situations to happen, even if they do - it's just dealing with dysphoria, I mean, what else can one do, right? 

I know and I appreciate it. Thank you!

Thank you so much! :)
I know right? Lol. (Damn, sorry to hear that, I hope you can get it back!)

Exactly, thanks, haha!
I'm so sorry to hear that! I sincerely hope it gets better for you, nobody deserves this.
Wow, that didn't even occur to me. This is bloody brilliant! Thanks! Haha
This is a really good advise 👆🏾
Exactly what I was gonna say. Two can play that game!
It's alright, thank you so much for your empathy. Definitely is, I may do that if he does it again in the future.
I understand that, I personally sorta like my voice and I hate the thought of changing it before getting HRT just because people keep making these assumptions. 
Same here. Ah, I see, interesting mix, haha. 

Unfortunately that is the reality for most part. Thank you so much for your understanding and empathy, I definitely understand what you mean and how you feel regarding that, but sadly it's how we have to live until society involves a bit more.
Exactly. It can happen to either, and it's not that uncommon for someone to have a different voice than what others are used to expecting from x or y gender. 

Oh, wow, I didn't know about that. 

Definitely, I know a singer that is like that. Exactly!
That's something I'd never think of. Really? That's awful, it must be terrible to deal with. I suppose not, but I prefer to be further direct, I'll just tell them that this disrespect has gone far enough and then proceed to educate them on this matter, hopefully they'll be more considerate.
Definitely seems like it, I'll see to it, thank you so much for your advice!
Glad to hear I'm not alone, haha!
He'd definitely be bothered by it, no doubt, haha.
Sadly yes. It's a bit hard not to pay attention in this case. I know, that's quite true. I...think I will. I'm going to give this some thought. Thank you.
Haha, brilliant idea! I might just do that if things take a specific turn, I mean, I love being passive aggressive when it's required after all, haha.
Another Redditor suggested that already, haha, definitely an option to keep in mind, haha.
Jk, but I will definitely lecture him on not to make assumptions based on voices solely, because if he was the one having a high voice - he would understand how this feels.
I'm with you. I generally pass decently well, until I open my mouth. I hate phone calls with strangers. Hopefully reporting him dows the trick! Such a jerk!
Its the whole concept of insurance practicing medicine. 

I have moved to pellets as of this month bc I cant do injections anymore and just paying out of pocket (esp since my employer ins has a 6k deductible and didnt know the state couldn’t kick me off medicaid bc of PHE until last month. O.o)
Yea, same to you! I feel like once I practice using a higher voice and then go through some voice coaching to do it as well as possible it will get at least a little better ya know
i feel that we got on the I want hrt and we never stopped to question why we want it. Because yeah sure, i want boobs, but I need to social transition first in my country before getting access to hrt which sucks ass. Why do I have to go out in feminine clothes at all. i am butch. 

I want hrt to feel better in my body for me. I shouldn't want to make me valid to the government and maybe to society at large. And yet i want to transition. To a butch lesbian though, so I would be me with boobs.... fuck I don't understand why they care honestly. Just treat us like we asked. it is called being polite you fucking asses. Sorry for cursing, but I am having bad day.
Of course! Stay strong fam ✌❤💙
Believe me, I understand you quite well. Just try to relax and shift your mind away from this topic. If you will need to talk - feel free to do it.
Exactly, that's what my daily life is like, I only get a manly voice sometimes - it happens randomly. Same here, I used to have panic attacks before just by hearing the phone ringing (even if it was from people whom I knew). 
Exactly, keeping my fingers crossed! I know right? Sigh.
It’s like in the United States everything we do, some rich man has to take a cut of it first. We can’t just do something as a society, somehow or a rich man has to be getting a cut of it, even if it’s somebody trying to do something good.

Also, the Republicans with her whole “death panels” thing. We have actual death panels, there other insurance companies!
Thanks! I'm most certain it'll definitely get better once you are able to start doing those things! :)
Thanks, you too! ❤️
I believe you, this is definitely a topic most trans individuals can relate to, and even cis individuals who don't happen to have a voice that matches their gender. 
I will try to do that, but...I'm sort of resisting doing that, I don't know why. Thank you.
That was thing about my old job I did like. I could correct people. It's when I'm in a cute dress, skirt, top, bright eye shadow, pink mask, cute jewelry and they call me sir 😑
I’m actually kinda able to start now cuz I figured out a little trick (I’m a singer lol) so I’ve been practicing it here and there the last day or so
I know what you mean.
Correcting people is definitely the best option we have, unfortunately they don't always respond well to that. 
I'm so sorry to hear that, that absolutely sucks!
That's great (that's awesome!), that's really good, hopefully it'll help you with your dysphoria! :)
Just got so old! I'd been there about a month and was fed up. Finally asked my boss about it. ""Hell yes you can correct them""! I got the two fold fun of being mask police and correct people. I miss my coworkers, but not the job.
It DOES. Like I’ve never been this happy ever cuz now I know I can get my voice to sound like it has in my head forever lol
I'm so sorry to hear that. That is amazing! I'm so happy you corrected them. :)
Haha, I can only imagine! But I'm so glad you could correct them. :) 
I definitely get that.
Wonderful! That's so wholesome and awesome!! :)
Thankfully, my coworkers were awesome. Haven't done official name change, but everyone calls me my preferred name. Actually started my new job and email, log in, etc was all my non preffered name. Asked IT. They got it all sorted! Felt good!
Thanks ☺️ it doesn’t help *much* and I’m still gonna need professional coaching ofc but a little progress is still a lot more than I’ve made before so 🥰🥰🥰
That's great!
That's so amazing, I'm so glad they call you by your preferred name! Ah, damn. 
Oh, wow, that's awesome news! I'm so happy for you! :)
Of course! Any progress is already pretty amazing, so I most definitely agree with you! :)
I freaking love it! Only downside is some of my students don't get it. The number of times I've heard, ""You look like a girl, but sound like a boy""! I just try to quickly say something like ""girls come in all shapes and sizes, and some of us sound different, and that's okay too""!
Yay! Oh, you're a teacher? Damn, that sucks, even I had to deal with such comments - kids wondering which gender I was and whatnot. 
Yes, that's *the* perfect answer! :)
Speech therapist, but similar vein! Most of mine are fine. Kids are actually extremely flexible when it comes to new concepts if you listen and explain. My favorite are the morons that try and tell me I'll damage them mentally. They get real pissy when I ask for their psych credentials. I'll put my decade of child development experience over their work in an office.
Ah, I see! Glad to hear. They definitely are, which is fantastic. 
Oh, wow, that's the most ridiculous thing I've ever heard. Lol. Definitely.
Many people believe that children are these incredibly mentally fragile creatures that any deviation from the binary idea with blow their minds. Oddly enough, I'm just capable in a dress, skirt, cute top, etc as with khakis and a polo. Most children are actually incredibly understanding if you explain a new concept to them. Now will some parents be mad because they have to answer tough questions? Maybe! Happened to me with a parent. Don't want to answer tough questions from your kid? Don't have them! It's part of being a parent.
That's ridiculous, lol. They're open-minded individuals, children can be exposed to any idea pretty much. 
Exactly, they're very understanding and empathic. Definitely, there are always parents like that unfortunately. Sorry to hear that. Exactly! Haha.
Right!? No clue if it'll happen, but I'd adore if some kid that I worked with or students that met me will remember me down the line and think ""that really tall girl with the deep voice was trans?! She seemed nice, and seemed happy.... that means I can come out too!!"" Likely? No idea! But I hope my example will help some other trans person down the line.
That would be lovely, haha. Maybe it can be likely, right? We never know what goes on in others' minds after all. :)
That's so nice of you, I hope for the same! :)"	s70iz7	trans	673	0.99	2022-01-18 15:48:43
We should be angry	"A girl was murdered, in all likelihood, for being trans, and yet the media first ignored she was trans, and are now editing articles to include her deadname and remove all mentions of her being a girl. 

This was a 16-year-old. 

The police knew she had been bullied at school for being trans and yet they did nothing, and now she’s dead.

All of us have seen how the media swarms the moment a trans person does something wrong, yet a 16-year-old killed for being trans is ignored by most and treated as a way of rubbing salt in the wound by the rest. 

We all knew this was coming. The media demonises us day after day and violence against us increases day after day, of course it was going to come to this, and yet all they care about is using trans people as a political football.  

We should be mournful, we should be devastated, but most of all, we should be angry. 

Angry at the media who demonise us. Angry at the police who did nothing to stop this. Angry at the people who will use this as an opportunity to deadname and misgender her. Angry at our friends and families and allies who stand by idly as the situation gets worse and worse for us, not actively harming us but just as much, doing nothing to actually help. 

We should be angry."	"This is insane to me, the media is so bigoted and one sided. A fucking 16 year old trans girl was murdered for being herself yet it’s being minimized by the media. But as soon as a single trans person does something, the media is all over it. Im tired of the damn hypocrisy
They will stop at nothing to eradicate trans people. We've been complacent with this bs for far too long
I am angry. I’m also at a loss.  In all seriousness, can someone please tell me what to do about it?  Taking to the streets 4,000 miles away doesn’t seem useful.  Angry emails get ignored.  What do we do?
Oh I’m angry. I’m also angry that any trans positive comment on these articles are getting downvoted into oblivion. They want us silenced and refuse to acknowledge our lived experiences
One of these days the trans community will rampage in the streets and make society realize we aren’t what they paint us to be, we’re just as strong as them if not stronger and we will show it one of these days I hope
Rage clicks drive engagement and therfore money and therefore they benefit and it is disgusting.
If this was anybody else, there'd be protests. There'd be a much larger anger against it. It would be way bigger.

But there's nothing. Because it's us.
I can understand not addressing the motive to minimize speculation (yeh I know, still giving them too much credit), but erasing the fact that she's a girl is despicable. Pure bad faith reporting.
Where are you getting the bit about her having been bullied for being trans? Haven't seen any mention of that yet
The media choose to side with the murderers
 Oh I’m not angry, I’m kinda furious. We don’t deserve this hate and this pain. We didn’t *do* anything to then but offend a book written by someone a long time ago! All we want to do is live our lives without all the pure spite and rage pointed at the transgender community, but not just them, all the LGBTQ+ communities! Why can’t we just **FUCKING LIVE???**
I’m ready to become the Malcolm X of trans rights. We’ve tried to drive out hate with love and this is where it’s gotten us. It’s time drive out hate with hate. We need hurt them back, ten times more than they hurt us. They deserve it.
Is there anywhere I can read more
[another article about Brianna Ghey](https://www.teenvogue.com/story/brianna-ghey-16-year-old-trans-girl-killed-in-uk)
I'm more scared than angry, I live 15-30 minutes away from where she was found
[deleted]
The UK population is about 67 million 

The population of England is about 56 million 

The world's population is about 8 billion 

The worldwide population of transgenders is estimated at around 1-2% of the world's population 

By rough estimate that's 80-160 million 

We could literally just move to the UK and take over
This isn't a meme, we should move to the UK and establish a transgendered state
I'm so fucking livid at this. Like, it shouldn't happen. She was a 16 year old girl, and murdered by 2 15 year olds. And as a recent turner of 18, I remember and still am a teen. Honestly, these kids should get prison. Or at least some jail time.
They had that Isla whoever on the news for WEEKS over a bogus claim that they'd be going into a women's prison. I didn't see anything on the news about Brianna this morning or this evening.
Seriously! My heart goes out to all of you in the UK, y’all have had a lot of bigotry, especially transphobia, to deal with over there. And I thought it was getting bad here…

(and of course my best wishes to her family and her soul, may she rest in peace).
When I heard I wondered for a moment if this is gonna have a similar followup to George Floyd. It should. This is beyond outragous.
I am I’ve been angry since I heard the news I’ve been scared and I’ve been angry, I’ve been devastated and horrified, but most of all I’m sorry. I’m sorry she had to go through that, I’m sorry she continuously gets disrespected even in death, I’m sorry the world wouldn’t just let her shine. She had just started her journey and because people want to talk about us like we aren’t human she was killed as if she wasn’t human. But she was she was a 16 year old girl with thoughts and feeling and hopes and dreams. I don’t know why people can’t see that. How can you just turn off your humanity like that all because of someone’s identity? We are human and humane but they are the farthest from it. Me and my best friend are turning 16 this year. My baby sibling have to grow up in this absolute mess of hate. I’m furious I’m so furious why can’t people just understand that words do mean things that the more you distance someone from being human the more likely they are to be killed by someone who listened to your words. Fuck them I hate them with every bone in my body. And then they use her death to fuel their hate speech even though their hate speech is the cause of her death? It’s so unfair I wish they would keep her name out of their fucking mouths. I hope the people who did this to her (directly and indirectly) never get a good nights rest ever again. I hate them so much I hope they never feel safe again. Soon we’ll do something about this. Rest in power Brianna Ghey.
I’m fucking livid. I’m terrified. I don’t know what the fuck to do because so many people in my life that I love are at risk of being murdered because they are who they are. I’m don’t know how to cope with this. Someone is dead. A 16 year old girl was brutally fucking murdered. And nobody cares. I’ve heard barely anything about it through the news, whereas all I’ve heard for the last months is how trans people are predators and trying to force their way into women’s sports. I’m angry and annoyed and so fucking tired of this.
This is actually the reason why they're called deadnames.  It's the name they put in your eulogy and engrave on your tombstone, as one final insult to your existence dealt by a society that never tries to understand.
I feel sorry for her and hope her family and friends are okay. I just don't really feel angry or anything like that, I'm burned out and tired. I wanna die and I am just never really okay so. Yeah. I just don't feel anything.
people are too busy being angry about a wizard game
We have this problem because the media is controlled by autocratic geriatrics who were raised to be xenophobic and resent that they can’t as easily be racist and homophobic now. They’ve been denied the pleasure of their worst evil and turn against us in desperation.

They’ve spent their careers, had and raised their families, lived their lives, and as is the case for so many bitter old white men, they want to lay claim to all our lives as well.  They’re greedy trash humans.

Their future isn’t a long story.  Persevere and let them watch their world expire before they do.  It’s justice of a sort.

>Revelation 12:12, NIV: Therefore rejoice, you heavens and you who dwell in them! But woe to the earth and the sea, because the devil has gone down to you! He is filled with fury, because he knows that his time is short.'
What media has dead named her?
Just fuck😭😭😭...
We should be angry, you're right, this is devastating and nothing new, but what should we do with that anger? Protest?
if a trans person does something bad they monopolize on their transness all the way through, it's completely bonkers
It's the same thing they do with everything, especially race.  If a black man commits a crime it's an indictment of the entire race.  If a white guy commits a crime who cares?  They're just a lone wolf, or misguided, or we need to support mental health (even though there's no evidence of mental illness and we have no intention of following through on this.)

At it's most basic, the prejudice and hatred of the political elite and business owners have made it OK to say we're less than human, and therefore are valid targets, both for physical violence and political marginalization.
Earlier this month a cis woman was sexually abused in a try to proof her trans when she went to use the bathroom in a samba school here in Brazil, the week before that they kicked out a trans woman for trying to use the bathroom.

None of those issues received much media attention but the case of the cis woman received almost none.

It is easy to understand, if they had exposed the cis case the effects of the right wing transphobic garbage would be open for everyone to see, the outrage would be much bigger and more people would side with the trans movement because suddenly bigotry would affect them too.

The media isn’t in the business of spreading information or sharing the news.
Organize with LGBTQ people in your area and keep fighting for our rights.
flee, that's what imma do
Find community with people like yourself, people you trust, and build a community where everyone can look to each other for support and security. All we have is each other, and the best thing you can do is have a network in your area, so if anyone they know or might hear of is facing difficulties y'all can be there to help. It's not easy and it takes a lot of time and effort, but it's really rewarding. I have a small group of friends who go to range days (all of us are trans / queer) and help introduce people to self defense of all sorts; we work together to contribute to a community kitchen run by another org, which helps motivate us to grow food and share bulk necessities to keep costs down. Just a few examples of things I do
im trying to become a better person, and i feel like its going well for me, but in moments like these my true self is coming out.

i don't think that i know how to be as mean and shitty anymore but god i am fuming with anger, spite and disgust
If rage drives engagement, rage should be directed in the right direction. Rage against the killers. Rage against the police who ONCE AGAIN do nothing. Rage against the government that caused it. That's a way better narrative than us being an 'insidious evil'.
Someone earlier in r/transgenderuk posted photos of emails sent to the police, school, and a judge regarding her having been previously attacked and bullied for being trans.
About Brianna?
They're in custody.  And children.  Are you prepared to ""do something"" about children?
I'm coming along!
It probably won't. The community is just too small to create a momentum which cannot be ignored.
I will never forget her name
It’s okay to take a step back. I know it all seems bleak right now but you have a whole community at your back, ready to support you if and when you need it.
*hugs*
🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗Im going to throw hugs in your direction, until I managed to make you at least a small bit happier 🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗🤗
This isn’t something we can just persevere. Trans people are dying. Trans kids are dying. We need change and we need it now and we won’t get that by simply persevering. We need to take action, whether that be protesting in the streets, reaching out to local politicians, helping each other get through it, or even just trying to spread awareness. Inaction and apathy means death for us.
The Times and the Daily Mail, though I imagine there are more which I haven’t seen
Protest, get in touch with politicians, support one another, spread awareness, give to charities, anything you can do to help.
I agree... unfortunately, at least in the US, the conservatives have more guns and are less afraid to use them indiscriminately.
Thank you. Poor girl 😥 I honestly can't take anymore of this
Yes :0
More so to their parents who taught them that’s okay
I know you mean well, but I am not accepted in the community at large because of how weird and abnormal my experience with gender is, so I know I can't count on the community either. My own friends are part of this and they can't support either.
It's fine don't worry about it
I apologize this kind of doesn't help me much, I just don't like being hugged or anything. I'm sorry I bothered you
https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/02/13/brianna-ghey-trans-girl-killed-the-times/
So sorry about that. Hope you can find similar ppl at least on the internet. Have you heard of r/voidpunk ?
Nope not bothering in and way.. I actually just wanted to make you smile. I’m now going to send friendly thoughts in your direction
I don't fit in with voidpunk either, I tried to go there before and I never felt welcomed or like I belonged. I just kept getting the same opinions of being on the spectrum or just being depressed instead of my gender being weird.
I am so sorry, this does not make me feel good. You're very nice, I'm just a freak so it's okay it's not you at all lol
You can come back to this comment, I will keep trying , when I think of something
If you could not use all the emojis, that would be very nice. It reminds me of people being sarcastic and bullying me in high school and early college. Sorry about that. Once again, not you, I'm just a freak.
I don’t think you’re a freak. You’re just refreshing. you have nothing to apologize for
The ellipses do the same, honestly it's fine don't worry about it it's all my fault it's all good don't worry."	1118aec	trans	661	0.99	2023-02-13 13:30:51
Transphobic Coworkers	"What is it with cishet men who avidly use discord and purposefully misgendering trans people? These mfs won't give me a break, it's always ""deadname does this"" or ""she does that"" like excuse me I literally wear a he/him pronouns badge to work, even though I also use neos I won't wear that badge to work in fear of them doing something even worse. They've even threatened me with SA before, making bets on how good I'd be in bed and threatening to attack me because they find it funny. I hate these types of men with a passion, immature little boys.

Update: I've handed in my notice, I won't have to stay there for much longer, I'm leaving the toxic environment to find a new job."	"Yea definitely report to hr any upstanding business has a legal obligation to have a safe professional work environment even if they are assholes
can you not report them?!
What company is this so I know not to work there?
I’m glad you’re leaving, but you should absolutely report them. Especially the threatening SA. If the boss says he won’t do anything, go above his head.
Good on you for handing in your notice man, you don’t deserve to deal with their nonsense!
Report them to your boss!!!!!!!!!!!!
Judicial process, it's aggression, it's totally fine to take some money of them, a workspace is to work, this kinda of behavior doesn't fit, even with trans, even with cis, every kind of aggression doesn't fit on the ambient, find a good attorney, and some laws about aggression in workplaces
The he/him badge is cringe. Don't wear that. Just go in there without it.
I would report them to the EEOC as well. This is sexual harassment, threats of sexual violence, and discrimination based on sex, all of which violate Title IX.
Good for you. That’s absolutely disgusting 🤢
As a cis(?)het(?) man(?) who avidly uses discord, idk pal, the edgy cringe just seeps into some people after a while, best to distance yourself from toxic assholes, hope you get yourself out pal
I use neo pronouns as well but refrain from sharing them because cis ppl never take them seriously:(

so glad youre quitting that transphobic ass place!
I'm so sorry that is happening, that's horrible
Walk out and don’t go back, fuck notice, your manager won’t fire them, they don’t value you as an employee, or your safety. They do not deserve a second of your time, presence, or labor.
Also record them for proof if you can when reporting to hr
I have and the boss has dismissed it saying unless they do anything physical he can't do anything
It's a small ice cream company from my city
Thank you !!
Don't think it's cringe, but it instantly identifies you as trans, cis people don't wear pronouns badges. Also I hope to god neopronoun badges aren't a thing
Op may live somewhere that two-party consent is required for recording. So I'd caution against this. But he can record it for his own records so he can write it down later.
This ^^^ “well you’re the only who seems to have an issue with x employee…”
Okay, can you report it to HR then?
How can he not do anything? It's clearly a violation of social ethics
This is clearly a case of harassment, and all companies have a clear line on harassment. If the boss is not willing to step in, take it straight to HR and go above your bosses head!
The key phrase if a boss says they can't or won't do anything: ""okay, can I get that in writing?""
Name and shame. These people (shitty management included) don't deserve your protection.
I don't have to know you're trans.
That's kinda the whole point of normalising people wearing them. If lots of people who aren't trans wear them, then it doesn't immediately out the trans people who do need to wear them.
Op has reasonable suspicion of them wanting to assault him, those recordings would probably hold up in court.

I agree that caution is advised but it is better to record and (if it comes to it) have your lawyer say it is unusable than to not record at all.
It's going to depend on local laws. They can be different for video vs audio recording, which is important to keep in mind. So it could be legal to have a video going and then use the audio from it.
2 party consent only applies to court evidence you can record all you want.
I'll try, thank you !
Okay thank you !!
I can understand why he wouldn't, as that also reveals his location.
Never said I was
That's fair, but I *wouldn't* record them for HR. Again, HR is there to protect the company, not the employee, and it would be too easy for an HR employee to say ""It's against the law to record someone else without their consent in this state, you're fired.""

And then it would be up to OP to prove it was retaliation/etc. He can certainly record for his own records, but I just personally think it's a bad idea to show them to HR.
I was wondering about that.
No. Disclosing the conversation to a third party (hr) would still be a crime. It's not something you'd probably go to jail over, but it might be enough for them to justify firing you over. 

I'm not a lawyer, yadda yadda.
Also if eveyone tells you they can’t do anything it’s probably best to leave that job before anything serious happens, better to be safe than sorry. they’re disgusting and i hope the situation improves :)
Make sure you mention the SA threats and use the magic phrase ""hostile work environment."" HR's job is to protect the company, not you, but if it seems like a lawsuit is cooking they will take action.

Meanwhile, take the time to document everything. If it's happening on a work discord, take screenshots. Write down dates, times, names, and any witnesses. ""On (date) at approximately (time), (name) said this to me: (quote here). This occurred in (location at work so if there's cameras they can verify) and (other name) and (third name) were around close enough to overhear.""

Be very specific. And start writing down any new examples as well. The more evidence you have the better. Even if you have to excuse yourself to write it down at that exact moment so you'll remember.
100% agree with him. Clearly you are being targeted and harassed. I would keep going up until something is done. Please be safe!
Could be a franchise.
Is it? In CA, and i think it's really going to depend on the state, it says it's unlawful to record private or confidential information w/o 2 part consent. The workplace is not private. There's no objectively reasonable understanding of privacy? I dunno, I'm not lawyer and this situation sucks. I'm glad OP is getting out of there. Sending love!
Thank you !!
I'd expect it to be something similar to video recording which is usually did they have an expectation of privacy where they're talking.
Document as many instances as you can before you quit. If you quit due to harassment you are eligible for unemployment in most places. It’s call constructive discharge."	shs4q2	trans	644	0.99	2022-02-01 10:47:12
Girlfriend misgenders me and worse..	"We are dating since october from last year, she met me when i was still transitioning(hiding with boymode) and in the first days i told her i am trans and wanted to be treated right with my pronouns and name.
Although... She constantly misgenders me when talking to me or even when talking to friends and such. Doesn't make me that uncomfortable, only makes me insecure about my masculine characteristics.
We were talking about Voice training and how hormone therapy doesn't change the Voice, and i noticed she was curious to hear my old voice so i did it and it surprised her a lot, never did again..
But in recent days, she wanted me to read a ero text using my old voice for some reason, i didn't do It because it was uncomfortable for me but she wanted so bad It made her mad.
One day that we were having an intimate moment, she just whispered me during sex ""i want to hear your real Voice""
I lost It right there and went home, for me i know it's hard to accept me but, it's just too much for me.
Thanks for reading.

Edit:Thank you everyone for the support, i think i made my choice for the better, i really needed to get all of this out of my chest.

Literaly about to cry as i just realized the shit i've been through"	"So your girlfriend disrespects your boundaries, actively does things that trigger your dysphoria, doesn't recognize your gender, and then gets mad at you when you stand up for yourself? Am I reading that right?   

What do you hope to hear from me and this community right now?
If she's not willing to respect who you are, then she's not worth being with in a relationship. If you've told her the things that make you uncomfortable and she refuses to acknowledge that they make you uncomfortable, then she's not worth your time.

If you do break things off with her, I wish you the best with your mental health when going through that.

Things will be okay in time. <3
If she doesn't understand that your real voice isn't the one you were born with, that's a major, MAJOR red flag.
I think she's not your girlfriend, hon... She's your dead name's girlfriend. I know that's hard but you deserve someone who wants YOU and not who they want you to be
She clearly doesn’t respect you. It’s a sad thing to say, but you’d probably be better without her.
I know it's hard to see that someone you love is bad for you, but she clearly doesn't respect you, it appears she wants to slowly force you to detransition by telling you to do things like ""use your real voice"", and misgendering you everytime, probably in hope you are gonna ""go back"" 

I think it's time to end it, she's probably just gonna keep hurting you 

But you'll find someone who loves you for how you truly are, that accepts you and your transness and loves you for it, not and not inspite of it
""real"" voice?? girl i would've lost it then and there. if she wants to date a man she should fuck off and date one, not waste your time and keep triggering you. i'm angry
That's an instant breakup for me.

""How you do anything is how you do everything."" ~ Unknown

A lack of compassion from whatever, be it narcissism, transphobia, jealousy or distain... doesn't matter it's a deal breaker. 

We gotta weed out many people unfortunately so with a tiny dating pool we are expected to date twice as many people than cishet folks just to find someone who isn't queerphobic or hateful??? 

Yea we got the short end... again!
The part about wanting to hear your “real voice” during sex, which is already way WAY out of line… I get the impression that she may be fetishizing you. I’d move on, personally. I like how you seemed to handle these events, and your (hopefully ex) girlfriend doesn’t seem to be aware enough of your needs. Get ready though, if she’s as toxic as she sounds, then it’s probably best to break up over the phone where you can just hang up and block if absolutely necessary. Protect yourself and your mental well-being girl.
There’s more red flags here than a communist parade. I’m sorry you have to deal with all this. You deserve someone who respects who you are.
Honest opinion ... ditch her. She never respected you from the very beginning and there's no reason to believe she ever will.
Yeah have a talk abt it with her, next time she does smth like this just drop her she's not for you
dump her ass.
Get rid of the whole girlfriend. You deserve to be treated better.
You deserve to be with someone who wants to be with the *real you,* not a role you’ve been forced to play. You are a woman and should be treated and loved as such.
Your girlfriend doesn’t seem to respect you and honestly doesn’t seem to view you as a woman. That might change with time but you deserve someone that respects you and your boundaries and that sees you as the person you are. To be honest I think she may have been looking for a feminine man and may not be all that interested in who you are and how you want to live. I really don’t think this relationship has a future but my opinion on that doesn’t matter. Talk to her and try and find a way to get this relationship to work for you or find a new one that does.
I have no words. I'm just so fucking sorry and hope that you're able to get out of this toxic situation. You are such a beautiful girl who is worth more than what this shitty person is giving you. <3
It sounds like she really wanted to date the man she thought you were, rather than the woman you are. I don't think that makes her a horrible person, but you definitely aren't the person that's right for her. Hopefully, if she has some growth, she can be friends with you and support you. Attraction is a weird thing, and both people in a relationship not having their needs met causes way more strain than a normal friendship would likely have.
Hun do yourself a favor and dump her IMMEDIATELY!!!!! If she isn’t going to respect your boundaries and beg you to do something that makes you UNCOMFORTABLE, then that honestly shows how little she seems to care. You deserve better than that, you deserve someone who will love you as you are, respect your boundaries, call you the right pronouns and definitely not beg to hear what she says is your “real” voice. Also what’s really funny about that part is your REAL voice is the one you currently have because that’s the one that fits the REAL you who is the wonderful and beautiful woman that you are transitioning in to. I hope that this helps you in some way and please don’t stay with someone who is just going to hurt you and make you uncomfortable. Much love to you ❤️
Baby, you need to get OUT. You are hurting the both of you by staying together, and you deserve actual love! 💜
Wowy, hell nah.

She could maybe claim confusion at the start but all the things with the voice? That's just a no.

Idk what you need to hear but this isnt it girl.
I'm sorry to hear this sis. She doesn't seem like she wants you to transition. Maybe you could sit down and talk to her. I know it will be hard because you both obviously have an attraction to each other but let her know that you are not at all a man. If she can't respect you for who you are then possibly it's not worth pursuing. I love you!! Message me if you want someone to talk to.💚💜❤️
She's head fucking you. Get away from her
I was with a boyfriend who had blatantly disrespected my identity and pronouns so much that I ended up in one of the worst depressive pits and tried to un-alive myself. 

If there is anyone in your life who isn’t supportive it’s best to cut them out so it doesn’t lead you down a dark path
For me the misgendering by itself would be enough to break up with her, this is above and beyond
She’s not a good girlfriend, it’d be better to drop her. I’m so sorry that you have to feel like this :(
She doesn’t sound like a worthwhile person to have in yournlife
Yeah sorry you've had to deal with that. From the sounds of it def doesn't respect your identity. Like I understand if misgendering every so often since for some people it takes adjustments, but when it's very blatant and trying to get you to do stuff that makes you feel uncomfortable then unless they refuse to adjust how they treat you then sadly is best to avoid. I've had to do it to a lot of my family especially on one of my sides that's very right wing. Just hope you're safe and doing well
Maybe she thought she was helping you be okay with your voice? If not then you’ve only described red flags
Screwing up pronouns is one thing, I have ADHD I get it, but all that other stuff is just, ew
End the relationship immediately
girl it seems like you're dating a straight woman. And straight women aren't attracted to other women, they're attracted to men. And although I'm sure your girlfriend does genuinely like you, your girlfriend is attracted to you as a man, so much so that she'd cross your boundaries to see you that way. I'm not gonna go as far as to say break up, but you should at least have a serious talk about this with her and ask her if she is genuinely attracted to you as a man or woman. And then maybe based off of that answer see if you should break it off
Either she knocks this shit off IMMEDIATELY and apologizes, or I would suggest to leave her. It's impossible to be with somebody that doesn't accept you.
She literally started dating you when you were in boy-mode. Stop being so selfish and realize this is hurting her too. You need to break up with her. You were trans and she signed up to be with a boyfriend not a girlfriend ffs.
even if my partner accidentally misgendered that would be a dealbreaker... you deserve better!
Dump her and let her know it's because she is a transphobe.
Get away from her if she don't respect you, she is probably going to keep doing that yk
It's hard to be alone, I can appreciate that, but I think you'll endure even more hardship by staying in this relationship. Good luck, wishing u nothing but the best
Oh honey. An accident is one thing but she’s not attracted to who you are. Your real voice is the one you use. Being alone has to be a better option than being with someone who doesn’t want you for you right?
But your ‘old’ is your voice, just use that
This was actually heartbreaking to read
She doesn't see you as a woman.

She sees you as a man who's acting.

You are both looking for someone different than the person you're currently dating.
Your “real voice” is any voice time you use your voice, like an impression or anything, idk if she lives under a rock but she clearly needs to do research on trans peeps, and just how not to be a jerk
Sorry but she needs to go and give her a right telling off you told her you trans and yet she's not respecting you don't care about your feelings wants something you not not to mention name and pro nouns drop her plenty more fishing the sea hugs you valid always remember that xx
Girl, you are well within your rights to be angry. She is blatantly disregarding your wishes and how you want to be treated, and the fact that she asked you to use your “real voice” means that she will never see you completely as a woman. I would have left too.

My wife and I have been together for almost 15 years, but I only came out to her 1.5 years ago. To this day, she has never asked me to speak in my old masculine voice. In fact, she often reminds me to focus more on my femme voice because when I get really comfortable around people, my voice slips. I am no longer able to reach the depths that my voice used to, but it’s just so hard to keep up the higher pitch. I know that I don’t have to have a higher pitched voice to be feminine, but I’m just so PHYSICALLY feminine that not having a higher pitch really draws attention, and that bothers me. 

My wife sees this and actively tries to help me and your partner should be doing the same thing, not holding on to the person you used to be.
I needed to tell someone this because i don't know If i just trust that she will recognize me for who i am or i just finish this relationship.
Thank you for kind words🥹
I i think i made my decision deep down my heart but i don't have the courage to stand up for myself this way, it's hard for me but i need to.
I even forced myself and It hurt a lot to do a voice that isn't mine anymore, for the joke i get it but being asked to do it in normal situations just fucks me up.
This this this this. Your partners should love you for who you are, and not who they think you are. Clearly she thinks you’re a man, and that’s not gonna work out well for either of you.
Thank you <3.
I Hope i can get through this break, i need more time alone so i can actually love myself first just to know what is good for me or not.
Recently i just think ppl use me for their own interests and just don't care really about how i feel about things.

Character development time lol 🥳
I'm angry and anxious af, i can't Just process the fact that i could've ended this sooner
Yeah... We got the fricking short end.

I can't help but feel miserable because of my last dates, and this one.. more trauma to the list
I had the feeling she was fetishizing me since we met, she told me she realized i was a boymodder because of the bra strings.. so..yeah
I'm breaking with her through the phone because i can't even look at her face and think about everything that happened at the same time
I will steal this idiom. Thank you.
Thank you ❤️

Everything's going to be fine, i can get through It.
She's bisexual and started talking with me because she noticed a ""boy wearing a Bra"" so yeah, she was curious.
I think you should just finish it, you're only gonna get more and more hurt, by what you said she clearly doesn't respect you and is trying to get you to act more ""masculine"" or do things that make you uncomfortable because she likes
She has shown every indication she does not respect you, and no indication she will recognise you for who you are. 

There’s no maybe, dump her.
I got a question for ya: you wanna borrow my boots with the heels or the composite cap boots for when you punt her ass to the curb? 

You deserve respect and love and to be treated like a person. She’s not giving you any of that, and you deserve better all the way.
Heres a tip for relationships, jobs, and most other things. If you ever find yourself thinking ""it's bad right now but it'll get better"", you're in denial. The only way it'll get better is if you make it better, by finding a better job, partner, videogame, or anything else.
she doesn't seem to be even trying though
It takes a lot of courage to stand up for your boundaries. But I believe in you. You had the courage to question who society said you were. You had the courage to embrace those feelings and follow your own path. You even had the courage to allow someone into your world. The courage to let them see the real you. You have the courage for anything. Someone once told me that courage is not the absence of fear. The absence of fear is stupidity. Courage is the ability to act in spite of the fear.
She's probably hurt you more than you realize.

Please, protect yourself. You deserve a relationship with someone who actually sees you.

EDIT: most of my dysphoria is vocal, so I understand how much that can fuck you up. The first thing my father said when we spoke post transition was that I still sounded like a boy.

That was in September. I still feel the sting from it even now.

I can't imagine how much worse it would be in an intimate context... Ugh
♡♡♡ character development time
still not your fault. you did stand up for yourself multiple times, right? and it sounds like you liked her. don't beat yourself up for being willing to give second chances

For what it’s worth, if you’ve been dating since October, then that means you were a lot better than I was at standing up to a disrespectful partner. 

I was dating an abusive and disrespectful man for a entire year, and my self esteem and mental health was gradually crushed until I got the courage to leave him after a whole year. 

For others, it takes even longer, so I don’t think you failed or anything but actually did really good at standing up for yourself in comparison to others.
it's not your fault. you're just trying to exist. every human being deserves respect and it's not fair that not everyone gets it.

there's someone great for you out there i promise
All the love, girl ❤️
Okay but still, she saw you as a BOY. Now you're a girl. If you knew you were a woman before dating her, that makes you a catfish. She is still wrong for being bi-curious but you can't be upset at her for wanting your boy voice. If you aren't selfish, break up with her so she can find a man.
\+1 this! time for a change
This! You'll see, it's so much better when you're not around transphobic people. This is not the same situation but when I left my parent's house (and my transphobic mom) and started to live with lovely people that respect me, it changed a lot of things and I was much more comfortable with myself. Reading the edit I think that you'll make the right choice and I'm proud of you ! 

(Ps: I don't wanna gaslight you, maybe ""the right choice"" wasn't the words to say... only you know what is best for you of course!)
yes!
Give me the composite cap boots fr.

Sometimes i really think i don't deserve good nor bad ppl, i really need to find myself and think about what is important for me, i'm done
I wish you’d have told me that September last year
I know this is off the main topic, but your comment resonated with me, as I’m sure it did others. About your father: He almost sounds bitter from the wording, if he was indeed so brief and dry with his wording in person. I would hug you if I could, but an internet hug will need to suffice. 🤗 You are valid, a beautiful human, and you are loved. 💜
Good on ya! That’s the healthy choice for sure. All that added stress is just awful all around.
Thank you... I didn't know how much I needed to hear that.  


On reflection, I think you're absolutely right. I think he has a lot of regrets, and they've turned to bitterness over time. Doesn't help that he's absolutely TERRIBLE at apologizing for anything.  


I'll take your perspective into my next therapist session and discuss it with her. Thanks again :)

I Cut off my Mom	"Hi. This is long. I just needed to get it out.

A little background, my mother and I have always been close. We rarely went 2 weeks without talking. I've lived all over the world, and we have always kept in touch regularly. When she comes to visit (she's out of state), she stays with me. She visited in late April 2022...

She's the first person I came out to, end of April 2022. I cried and asked if she would still love me if I was a man. She cried and said ""I see your soul, I will always love you."" I hadn't come to accept that I was a trans man yet, I thought maybe NB? I started to explore my transition options (binder, haircut, masc nickname). We still talked regularly.

FF to end of May. I'm shopping for clothes and not having a great time. Called my mom for support, she says, ""you could just be a woman with short hair and men's pants."" All I could think was, No, I cant. I'm not a woman. If I needed another ah-ha moment... there it was.

We stopped talking as much, definitely didn't talk about my transition bc she seemed uncomfortable with it. She did say that if I tell anyone, I should tell them in person, its respectful.

Beginning of July, I call her. She's a couple states away so in person isn't really viable, so video chat instead. I tell her, I'm a trans man. I go by Davis. I use he/him pronouns. She cries. Says it will be an adjustment, but she loves me and wants to be supportive. In the same conversation my step dad walks in, asks who she's talking to... I get deadnamed and misgendered. She didn't even attempt to explain that I have a new name.

Throughout July, I come out to my family. My brothers and my father. Two brothers are fine, then one refuses to acknowledge it at all. Not denial but refusal. I cut him out of my life. He called our mom. Mom called me. We had a huge argument. It ended with her needing time to 'mourn her daughter'. And I figured I'd just give her space.

I told my dad 2 days later. He was surprisingly ok? Like he doesn't agree, but he'd rather have a relationship with me this way than no relationship. To him, I ""used to be his daughter but thinks he's a guy now"" (quoting my sister in law from a conversation yesterday). And considering my very conservative father... I'll take it. He at least gets my name and pronouns right. Yes, its a very low bar.

I was surprised my mother didn't call me to see how it went with my dad (dad and I have never had a great relationship), but figured she's still upset so let it go.

4 weeks and 1 day from our argument, she contacts me.

She said my dad has been trying to call me all month but I keep blocking his calls. (aside: I'm not blocking his calls, I talked to him, he has 2 numbers stored for me and keeps calling the wrong one.. I've had the same number for 8 years). And she says that she was afraid to contact me because my dad having blocked calls must mean that I've blocked everyone. And here's the run down of her discussion with my dad:

Dad: deadname blocks my calls

Mom: I don't know why she would do that

Me listening to this from her: I don't know why \*she\* would do that either... I thought \*she\* was dead, since you are mourning \*her\*.

Mom: what?

Me: You are mourning \*her\*, you said so. I'm not sure how a dead person is blocking calls.

Mom: I'm talking about you!

Me: I get that, but I'm a guy.

Mom: You are a woman.

Me: Ok, <moms legal first name here>

Mom: Don't disrespect me like that! I am your mother!

Me: Don't disrespect me like that! I am a man!

Mom: You cant make me change my core beliefs!

Me: I wish you a happy life Mrs. <moms legal last name here>.

Then I hung up.

\---

So TLDR: She said she will always mourn her daughter. And that I am a woman and cannot change that and cannot change her core beliefs. She said its disrespectful to try to force this on her and change her beliefs. I'm guessing she doesn't see the irony that she's disrespecting me at every turn.

I was wondering, AITA? But I don't think I care anymore, I'm mostly I'm just tired of her shit.

Edited for formatting."	"This triggered something within me because I recently came out as trans and have had similar experiences with my family. I am so sorry that you are going through this, it is never easy to cut off someone, especially immediate family. 

I want to tell you that I am so proud of you for standing up for yourself and setting boundaries. You did the right thing, and even though it's difficult, please stand in your strength. You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother. If she cannot respect you and your identity, she does not need to be in your life. You deserve to be surrounded by people who accept you for who you are. Lots of love from a fellow trans 🏳️‍⚧️❤️
You're not the AH here. I had to cut of my so called ""father"", but more a lack of question. Kinda similar like what you told. He just refused to use my proper name and she/her. We haven't talked in soon 5 years.

VERY much on your side in this. Our sides in this.
Fucking hell. Somewhere along the line she forgot you weren't her property.
I don't think you're an AH. You didn't ask her to completely come around. You gave everyone leniency and patience. And even those not accepting you, you continued to give time and space so they might eventually fully come around. Your boundary is that they have to at least try to respect you. And your mother refused that. So you cut her off.   

I came out to my dad 7 weeks ago. I asked him to start using my name and pronouns about 3 weeks ago. He hasn't yet. But he's getting a therapist to work through all of this. He keeps telling me ""I'm not ok with this."" And it sucks because he and I were close. But I always knew he was transphobic, though he of course didn't think he was. And if he doesn't come around in the next few weeks, I'll be cutting him off as well.  

I'm out to almost everyone in my life now and I'm not going to spend time with people who won't respect me for who I am. I don't care what their excuses are. By not using my name or pronouns, you're reminding me of how I was born. Something I can't control, but something that hurts to think about. I need to move forward and I need to be the woman I should have been born as. And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.  

Being trans is hard enough without people being casual bigots around us.
You’re not the a**hole here. You can’t choose how they handle their stuff, but that doesn’t mean you have to just sit there and take the bull. I went through something similar with my mom a few weeks ago. They’re going to be in pain because we’re setting the boundaries we need, but there’s nothing to do except violate our own boundaries and mental health for them. Honestly kudos to you for being able to tell them that stuff over the phone 😂 I literally couldn’t and had to mail them a letter telling them I’d only talk to them on mail for now.
You must find the courage to leave the table
If respect is no longer being served

—Tene Edwards


I’m proud of you.
Very similar to how it went with my mom, apart from the last bit where she fully denied that you're a man and refused to change her core beliefs. But I did recently hear from my older brother (who accepts me completely), that our mom had said to him something along the lines of ""no wonder he's having mental health issues with the stuff (testosterone) he's he's putting in his body."" The mental health issues are completely unrelated to my transition and are something I've struggled with for years, even before I knew I was trans, and additionally tried to get help for in high school, but my mom kept me from seeing a therapist.

Suffice to say, it added to the pile of reasons to cease contact with her. I don't think I've fully decided and/or committed to it, but it's been well over a month since I last talked to her and whenever I think of calling I'm none too eager.

Good on you for making that call for yourself. Plenty of people will tell you that it was the wrong choice or that they would have done differently or that you should forgive her, but ultimately it's your life and you should not sacrifice your happiness for the sake of someone who does not respect you. If you feel your life would be better without her in it, then you made the right choice.
I cut my mother (and soon it’ll be all my family) out of my life completely years ago and I have no regrets, nobody should have to put up with being belittled, abused or whatever it is just because you share some stupid dna. I personally have much less anxiety and shit to worry about now and nothing will make me go back.
Fuck im sorry you had to deal with that. Its never good whenever either parents that aren't supportive. Whenever I came out to my mom she told my dad and then did nothing to help me. They didn't try to call me by the name i felt more comfortable with or gender me correctly. They wanted to act like I never said it
You have been patient and reasonable.

If people won't accept who you are and are happy to cause you pain and suffering in the process, cutting them out of your life is a completely valid way of dealing with that.

Maybe they'll learn from it, maybe they won't. You have to do what's right for you.

You don't know me, but I'm proud of you for standing strong.
i don't have much to add, but it was kind of jarring seeing your name because it was my deadname lmao. never met anyone else with it, its fun :)
‘Mourn her daughter?’ Huge red flag already just from that eesh. I hate people like that
Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning. It sounds like they have been pushed through their own transitions faster than they can either individually or collectively cope with. A month or so is just not remotely enough time. Hell, a couple of years at least is needed. Sadly, it sounds like these relationships have broken down badly.

For what it's worth, even giving family years doesn't ensure a better outcome. I was estranged from my father right up to his death and I'm now estranged from the rest of my family too. So happy endings are not the norm or even common.

Wishing you peace of mind with your decision to transition. That's the best you can hope for. Hugs.
>You do not owe anyone anything, even your mother.

Thank you. <3
🤣
>And I'm not going to play games with people who don't want to support my happiness.

I keep being told that I'm choosing this. I'm choosing to be trans. I'm choosing this and making everyone else get in line or get out. \*sigh\*. 

Like, I didn't choose to be trans. I chose to start living as my true self, and you know BE HAPPY.

Good luck with your dad. I'm glad he's seeing someone. Its hard for us and its hard for them.
Yeah, I'm transitioning quickly. But I shouldn't have to sit thru purposeful disrespect just so they can have more time. I get that it's a change... but I'm being told they won't change at all and I don't see a reason to keep someone like that in my life. If in the future they can remember it's He not She, my door is always open.
""Family need a long LONG time to adapt to a family member transitioning.""

Not in my experience. My brother, who I fully expected to react badly, just started crying and apologising for all the hurtful things he probably said to me growing up. Five minutes later I was his sister who he would love, support and defend.

So the whole family requiring extra time because they are family is just bullshit. You're either accepting and love someone unconditionally or you aren't and would rather guard your own insecurities than support someone who really needs you.
I would even argue ""especially"" your mother. Sending you lots of love ❤️
Thanks.   

Yeah, I see the same situation constantly. Even those who support me often think I'm ""choosing"" something. Like, I'm really not. I'm just trying to be myself without extra stress and anxiety. It must be nice being totally comfortable in your own skin and having the right hormones coursing through your body. But I don't get that luxury. So I have to medically intervene.  

If legitimate medical treatment upsets you, then maybe you shouldn't have that pacemaker or that tumor removed? Maybe you shouldn't be on depression or anti-anxiety meds and take your chances with your blood pressure?  

I'm not ""making"" anyone do anything. I'm *asking* for the people who claim to love me to just respect me. Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss *you* off. Like, what a selfish thought pattern.
Remember to keep reiterating that to them... It's important. But you also need to give them a reason to want to make the transition too. No one accepts unwanted change willingly. After about 7 years I was able to talk with my mother again. My entire family blanked me for years after my transition. Unfortunately, the superficial vaneer she had painted over who I really am wasn't enough for me and the relationship subsequently broken down when I got married because she wouldn't attend my marriage. Same went for the rest of my family. Not a single family member attended my wedding. Zoe and I have been together since 2006 and married for the last 5 of those years. Yet my family can't accept who I really am even though I transitioned in 2003. That's a long, long time to accept who I am if they gave a shit. My point is, it's a tough road to walk and there just may not be enough between you and your family to pull you together again. I hope there is though because it's a cold stone in your heart if it isn't.
If you are in a supportive family... That is truly awesome for you! Sadly, the statistics put that as exceptional rather than the norm. Perhaps do some background research on family integration of transitioning family members.

Books like [this](https://www.taylorfrancis.com/chapters/edit/10.4324/9781003001881-10/transitioning-families-butch-losey) for example.

Supportive families are becoming more 'common' but family transitions are still very much a thing. Typically with rejection of the transitioning family member so that the family unit can retain its world views.
>Treat me like a human being with feelings and thoughts and intelligence. And as someone you trust and believe and who wouldn't do something so drastic just to piss you off.

Yep. In hindsight, I think my mom saying I should tell everyone in person, was almost a dare. Like, OH, they wont really do this. They wont REALLY tell their dad. And then I did. And I started on T.

I told her about T, she didn't ask about how it would affect me, she asks, have you had any side effects yet? Like, wtf? I'm thinking she might have read that terf book about FtMs.

Like if someone is getting medical treatment, you ask, how are you feeling? not, any side effects yet?
>give them a reason to want to make the transition too.

How about, they love me?
But I’m not in a supportive family. I will likely never speak to my parents again. My point was that whether or not a relationship is familial has no relevance for how long they need to adapt. 

People either love and accept us unconditionally or they don’t - its that simple.

I also don’t require education on transitioning and family. I have lived it thanks.
My dad has yet to ask me if I'm happy. If I feel better. How the transition is going. It's just about how he can't accept it and can't call me his daughter and is worried what his parents will think.  

Luckily, he's pretty much alone so far. Him and his parents are likely to be the only ones in my life who aren't supportive. His wife (my stepmom), my sister, the rest of the family, my wife and her family, and all of my friends fully support me. So he can sit in a corner and mope alone when the holidays roll around I guess.
Yeah, if people 'actually' had unconditional love in the first place that would be a given. The truth is sadly, that unconditional love really means that you continue to live within the social framework that they live by. Transitioning throws that out of the window, so in their eyes, you broke the unwritten clauses in that 'unconditional love' contract. Also, very few parents and siblings actually do love unconditionally, even by their own terms of reference! Mostly, it's a veneer of convenience... Make of that what you will.
Then I can only wish the best for the future!
They really do think that we just drop a nuke into the center of our lives, for funsies. For the lolz. Because we were bored on a Tuesday. 

Wake up. Make Coffee. Be trans just to piss everyone off. LOL!
I prefer to be trans BEFORE my coffee bc then I'm extra moody about it.
I told my partner that coffee makes me less stabby. He was like, you're not functional before coffee (ie you cant be stabby). I was like, ok, it makes me more stabby? hahahahahaaaaaaaa!"	wo923r	trans	634	0.98	2022-08-14 15:30:24
"""my dad is the prettiest girl. I love her soooo much"" - my 7yo daughter. Parenting as a trans woman vent."	"(this story is about the notion that calling a trans woman who has a kid ""dad"" is perhaps  misgendering and/or perhaps unhealthy)

Ive been out for about 2 years and have been properly presenting full time feminine for 1.5 years or so. Current name has been the 100% norm for about a year. (It's a common unambiguously female name)

My daughter calls me dad still. In public and to everyone in her life. I go along with it. I say it too. People who know me and then meet her will hear her say dad and are usually like ""oh ummm.. sorry I thought... Not mom?"" 

and I reply ""no it's fine I'm still dad and it's ok. She's the only one in the world who gets to call me the thing she wants to call me. It's a special bond and I'm gonna learn to love it cuz it's for her.""

Ngl I do want it to get to where she says something more like mom or mama or whatever. But it's the damnedest thing cuz she's so otherwise on board and supportive of me. Even corrects people in public if they get pronouns wrong ""actually my dad is a girl"" and it blows peoples minds.

Idk how I lucked out with such a sweet kid. 

idk it's weird to think about. I have let her know that if she changes her mind that's great and if not that's cool too. But I also let her know that deep inside I've ""always felt like a mom to you"" but that it's ok still say dad.

Is this a healthy approach? is calling me dad in this context a form of misgendering? Should I try to actively get her to call me mom? Kinda stuck on the fence tbh."	"I had that talk with my kids last year (14 and 13 then). I gave them the choice to decide what to call me,  even anticipated and was prepared to accept if they chose to keep ""dad"".  But I also reserved the right to veto their choice.   They ultimately chose to call me mother and my wife mom,  but only after I vetoed ""mom 2: electric Boogaloo"".  Reddit seems to feel that I tossed away an amazing opportunity.   To be fair,  they will occasionally use the vetoed name.   All done with love.
My two kids, 13&14, call me dad and that’s utterly cool with me. I’ve been their dad from the start and I guess always will be. My pronouns are they/she and I present fully female.
I often have to correct children at schools I work in to use Mx (my honorific title) instead of sir and that’s ok, they catch on quite quickly. My own children have begun to use they/them for me but when discussing it I could see a small amount of relief when I said I’m still very happy with them using “dad”.
When all is said and done I feel like their dad even though there is nothing else male I relate to, and the kids calling me dad makes them comfortable and happy so it works all round.
So I'm divorced and dealing with this with my kids. First, my 6 and 4 year old won't know until they are older. I just feel like they need more time and it will only serve to confuse them after a brutal divorce. Secondly, I'll tell my kids to always consider me their dad. Not because I don't consider myself a woman, but because I in no way want to replace their mom. As much as I can't stand her, she carried them for nine months and I'm not going to try to take that away from her. I told my daughter even as Sarah I plan on walking her down the aisle.That being said, my daughter is extremely excited to go shopping with Sarah and getting nails done.
My 12 year old and 14 year old both call me dad. Their friends call me Mrs. Dad (they used to call me dad when they needed something). I have been transitioning for almost 3 years, full time for 4. I was a father figure to some of my kids’ friends and I love how they’ve embraced and accepted me as who I am. 

I will always be their dad regardless of what I look like or what my name is.
One trans friends was having the same experience with her young daughter. They came up with a nickname that only her daughter could use, basically a substitute for  ‘dad’. In their case they settled on ‘Didi’ which I think is such a beautiful comprise. How this helps 💛
My daughter (6yo at the time) settled the matter for us when I came out. She decided that I'd be 'Mom' and my wife would be 'Mommy', and she is adamant about which is which. If one of us answers to the wrong title, she's quick to correct us.

For me, a huge part of the feelings around gendered titles and pronouns is intent. My parents-in-law misgender me all the time, but I know they're trying. It doesn't bother me. I imagine that, were I in your position, with a daughter who is obviously so excited and accepting, the 'Dad' title wouldn't bug me.
I have two kids and they both call me dad/daddy. The older one understands my transition a little more, and calls me a ""beautiful girl"" a lot. Both my babies are what I call miracle babies, one nearly died during childbirth, the other was born after my ex wife had a painful miscarriage. The title ""dad"" is one I'm extremely proud of and cherish every moment I get to hear my kids say it.
When I was coming to terms with my own realisation, my wife and I had this conversation with our children about it. And we all agreed to use DeeDee instead of dad. And that went well for a year or so, but now it’s slowly becoming Mama while my wife is Mummy. Maybe see if your child will try DeeDee?
If YOU are comfortable with your kiddo calling you “dad”, then it’s fine. End of. 

You’re the only person who gets to decide what constitutes misgendering YOU. It would only be a problem if you started trying to insist that all transfemme parents should be ok with their kids calling them “dad”. 

And breaking down gendered barriers about who can be what, plus making the point that respect is about behaving toward individuals as each individual prefers, not about hard and fast rules that must never be deviated from, only benefits all of us.
I think this is a wonderful chance to teach her emotional maturity.

To start off, you sound like a wonderful mom. Your daughter is very lucky.

It sounds like your daughter genuinely does not understand that the label ""dad"" is no longer appropriate for you. I don't need to tell you this because you've lived it, but just to bring it into the discussion, the sort of physical-psychic bond you form with your child in that pre-verbal state of mind is frankly mystical. Probably to her, you are simply ""dad,"" unchangeable, ineffable, like a tree is a tree or a stone is a stone.

We don't know! I wonder: forgive the silly question because you've probably already tried, but is she mature enough that if you sat her down and asked *why* she continues to call you ""dad"" despite correcting other people on your gender, you might be able to find an opening to explain how much it would mean to you to be called ""mom?""

To most clearly/directly answer your question, I think that a conversation about why she hesitates to call you mom, followed by an explanation of how much it would mean to you to be called mom, would not only help you over this barrier but also grow your daughter into an even more emotionally mature person.

Good luck!
I have 6 beautiful children, mostly grown, and they all call me Dad. My granddaughter calls me Glampa. These are honorable titles that I've earned with my kids. I'm not their mother. My youngest daughter calls me her ""Girl Dad"" and I love that too. I live my life completely female and have for 7 years now, but I'm still super happy to be a Dad and Glampa. It makes sense to my critters and takes nothing away from me or my journey. To each their own :)
They just call me mapa. When I ask my kids they say a mix of “mama and papa”
My sister did that to me🥲 she was like “no she’s a boy” in front of my uncle and three random children who I hadn’t come out too. It was terrifying but I was kinda happy
My siblings insisted I tell them what pronouns and such I feel comfortable with. My sister has insisted on calling me her big sister. I have told my brother that I view titles of ""brother"" and ""uncle"" like achievement titles in WoW and that my nephews can still call me uncle.  I have recently asked that she/her pronouns be used, and they're on board. I've also said if someone refers to me as ""ms"" or ""ma'am"" or what have you, that they don't correct it (out of safety concerns). 

I think it's important that you go with what you find acceptable. If other people are bothered by it, it's their problem, not yours.  The dynamic between you and your daughter is between you two, and it's likely that over time, it may shift to where she calls you mom instead.
I prefer they/them pronouns. I love it when others do the same. I avoid gendered language as best I can when referencing myself.

When I talk to my very little kid about myself, I use he/him because it just feels weird otherwise, especially for initial language development. I am happy to be Dad and Husband. 

So I guess it's to each their own. I could see someone getting really irritated with this, either of it was to them or on my behalf, but everyone has their own level of comfort.
My daughter is 7 months as of yesterday, and I realized I was trans just over a month ago. I'm still needing to figure out what I'm going to want her to call me. I'm thinking staying with dad, but I'm not sure.
Seems like if your daughter is good with it and you are good with it then it's fine. Nobody is a victim based on your telling of the story.
Mmm.....  I mean if you WANT her to start calling you mom I think you need the conversation with her. Just keep it simple.  Is the other mother supportive and in the picture?

Because if you can have a super simple, light conversation maybe at lunch or something and say "" Hey, ...(insert name here )  I don't mind you calling me anything you want but, now that I'm a woman being dad seems a little funny huh ? "" 

or if she doesn't get it . . . maybe seeing if the mom would be comfortable saying something along the lines of "" Now that dad is a woman don't you think it's time to start calling her mom too? Must get confusing to people who don't know and I'm sure dad is tired of explaining why/how she is "" dad ""

otherwise if you want to go more into it you may have to wait 2-3 yrs to where she understands the weight of "" Baby it draws unnecessary attention to dad. Attention that dad doesn't need because those people may not agree with dad being a woman ""
My mom and I have the same bond. She’s the only one I’m cool with calling me son. I am her son. I’m just also her daughter now lol. In public, once I’m passing, she said that she will use the proper pronouns and whatnot (at my discretion, not “when I’m passing”, that just happens to be when I want to make that social change).
are you cool with bro called dad? because if you are it’s not really misgendering. as long as y’all are happy i’d stick to it
I came out 4 years ago, 11 years into my marriage with a cishet woman. She understandably struggled with my transition. We are in a much better place now but she did struggle with gendering me correctly the first couple years, and our kids modeled that. We have 7-, 5-, and 3-year-olds. 

The two older ones are finally consistently calling me Mommy April the last 6 months or so. My youngest does it about half the time. Plenty of embarrassing memories being shouted daddy across a store etc. lol. 

Anyway idk what works best in your situation but when kids called me daddy I’d just gently correct by saying “Mommy April” and then help them with whatever. Adding my name after mommy helped everyone ease into it I think but if nothing else it’s easier to understand which of us is being called lol. Plenty of other options of course. 

I also think age was a big part once they hit 4-5 it seemed easier.
People have different levels of comfort. If your comfortable with it. There’s no probleme.
My girlfriend has a son that calls her dad. It is fine for her to call you dad. My girlfriends son is happy go lucky.  You will likely wake up one day and she will call you mama or something feminine like that. Just cherish the time with your daughter!
You're the only one that can decide what you want to be referred to as. I don't think you can make an incorrect choice. If it works for you, go with it. If it's not working so much, change it.

You do you. Norms be damned.
I am a trans man and my 5 year old still calls me Mom. I would prefer something else, but she is definitely not having any of it and I am immutably Mom in her eyes. 

I am okay with this in itself, but I will say that depending on where you live and/or visit, there is a definite safety issue associated with your kids drawing attention to your transness in public. I had to have a conversation with my very young daughter about this, so she knows not to yell ""MOMMY!"" when we are, for example, at a Sheetz in rural West Virginia during a road trip. She just calls me by my first name when we are in these types of situations.
I think what you choose with her is up to you if being her dad even though your fem fits then that's for you to decide. I wonder if some cis lesbians might have their kids call one dad? 🤔 as a gender queer AFAB I wouldn't mind being called either but my husband is a cis male so I'll let him be the dad lol. If you feel like dad doesn't fit then talk to her. I'm sure she'll make an active effort to change what she calls you. She seems like a great kid.
It really depends. Does her calling you dad make you sad? Or would you prefer to be called mom? If you are completely fine with being called ""dad"", then what's the harm. Since your child is gendering you the way you want it; it's fine. If it hurts inside, then perhaps you could push your girl a little harder to fully respect you. If it means true happiness in a relationship, then fully respecting each other is the way to go
(I’m ftm) My son was 7 when I began my transition. I asked him to change his language and he did. He understood that I was always going to be his person with our same bond, no matter what I was called, but that calling me Dad gave me a higher quality of life (especially in public). It was a no brainer for him, but I also didn’t present it as a choice. I approached the conversation in the same way I would for any scenario where I need my kids to comply: 1) offer age appropriate explanation of what’s going on, 2) check for understanding 3) “so, given all that, here’s what I need from you”, and 4) move forward with a clear new boundary.

I do remember feeling nervous and fearful about what I would be asking of him and how that may impact him. As parents, our main objective is to protect and empower our children- and oftentimes we do that by insulating them from unnecessary hardship. On the other hand, as trans people, we are actively trying to get away from insulating others, so that we can exist as our authentic selves. This is tricky business to navigate! Ultimately, I decided that not giving my kids a free pass to misgender me was better for everyone- better for me obviously, better for my kids because *they get to know me and love me and respect me based on what’s true about me* which is what I’ve taught them to expect from the world about themselves, and better for the community because my kids are learning that their feelings don’t override anyone else’s existence.

No judgement, OP, but I do encourage you with all my love and support to keep talking to your child about this. ❤️
My stepchildren's ""dad"" is a mtf. They call her Maddie. I think that'd be a good compromise if you can get her to call you that.
If she loves her ""Dad"" and he ""fathered"" her, when he was male.. AND  Dad is cool with it, it is none of your damned business what she calls her Dad.
Why not call one mom cis mom and the other mom trans mom.
She sounds like such a sweetheart.
I came out to my three kids (4, 6, and 9) in December, telling them that I felt more comfortable s as a woman, and told them if they wanted to still call me “Dad” that was OK with me. Recently though my youngest has been calling me mommy or daddy interchangeably, and my oldest said “in a few years when you look like a girl and have your girl voice, I think I’ll feel weird calling you Dad.” Your 7-year-old may well want to change the name she’s used in a few years too, and since I think of myself foremost as just “their parent”, the title doesn’t really matter to me. Obviously though that may not be be the case for you.

In case you don’t already have it, one of the first books we got for them on this subject was [She’s My Dad!](https://a.co/d/fMNuM9L) which is really great.
You don't have a problem with it.

Your kid doesn't have a problem with it.

If anyone has a problem with it they can shove it up their ass.

You're a great parent, and if you're ""dad"" then that's fine
You do you there is no playbook for this thing. Does being called Dad make you feel dysphoric? Does the reaction you get from strangers cause problems or make you feel in danger? If the answer is no then no worries you're good.

Originally if been ok with dad but it started feeling as little awkward as my transition went on. Eventually I had an incident where I brought my kids into a busy women's washroom and my youngest shouted ""Daddy I need some help!"" Instantly I felt every eye on me and my anxiety went through the roof. So after that we changed it up, and now I go by Mymy. My kids mother owns Mom and that's cool I wouldn't take that from her, but I wanted something that was at least close enough that I didn't attract too much attention.
Tbh there’s a high chance shes unaware of her words, kids just speak and don’t really but all too much thought lol.. she acknowledges you are now a woman, but probably doesn’t know the terms also change lol. Id sit down with her or maybe go out, do something fun and talk to her, that typically when someone becomes a girl like you, boy or some else, terms like “mom/dad” change. In your case you would like to be referred to as her mom because you are a woman ‘now’. (Im trying my best to put it in a way a child can understand) it may take a while for her to stop, but be sure to be patient and correct when term misgendering happens so she doesn’t forget and resume
OMG the hardest thing I had to deal with is to stop calling my husband my wife. For a long time, everyone knew my “wife” had he/him pronouns and everyone rolled with that. Then, other people putting the female in “wife” got to be too much for him and now it bugs him. He knows when I call him my wife, it has no gender attached to the word. It’s when other people think of him as my “wife” that it bugs him, and I respect that completely.

But ohhhh, divorcing the word from him has been so hard! “Spouse” sounds so cold and “partner” feels trite. “Wife” feels warm and fuzzy and like home. “Husband” sounds like I submitted to the patriarchy and I hate it. My entire life, i’ve built up this shell to ignore the opinions and thoughts of idiots, so submitting to THEIR naming conventions feels really bad. In this case, I’m not allowed to ignore them. Yes, I see the hypocrisy in that, and am grappling with it.

All of that is my problem. We’ve talked about it and are on the same page. He wants to present as completely male to the world which I support and respect. I’m still gonna complain in a safe place!

Thanks for listening!
I don’t know, this doesn’t really seem appropriate to me, but what do I know, plus I want you to to have a good relationship! It seems like she may be doesn’t understand what she’s doing with us… Especially since it seems like she is excepting and defends you and stuff 

I don’t know
I gave my kids a choice, they chose to call me Nana which to me means grandma but to them it means me so whatevs. 

They chose it because we play a lot of smash bros and I was maining ice climbers (Nana and Popo) around the time I came out. Since Nana is the girl of the duo, naturally I became Nana.
I think this is totally healthy! I've decided against having kids but when I think about it I see myself as a Mum even though I'm FtM especially if I carried the baby and gave birth, but I might choose to be called Dad for simplicity. Mum and Dad denote what role someone plays in a pregnancy rather than gender in my mind if that makes sense. I know this doesn't apply to other methods like surrogacy please don't come for me!
My heart melted when I read “actually my dad is a girl!” 💕
My father wasn't a girl, and he wasn't a good father.  I think everyone would be happier with a girl dad.  I want to be a girl dad now!
My kids called me Dad for 2 years into my transition.  I get it, I didn’t look like a Mom to them and had constantly said to me and everyone I was the best Dad ever.  I told them (in a loving way) that I felt like a mom to them.  But they couldn’t see me as “mom”.  Then when the hormones started to work and i started looking like a Mom, people would look and stare at us when they would run up yelling “Daddy!”   They started noticing people looking at us a lot when they called me Daddy.  They asked me why and I asked them “do I look more like other kids Mom or Dad?  They said I looked like a Mom.  I then asked them to reconsider what they call me, just not “Dad”.   My older son started using “Mama” while my younger son, who has my sense of humor, as we were driving home saw a street sign during the conversation smiled and said “street sign”. So for a few days I was street sign and Mama!  He changed it to Mama, he just needed some fun and to get used to it.  They are 13&11 now, I transitioned 5 years ago.
If you don’t consider it misgendering then it isn’t misgendering. It’s a matter of personal perspective.
My 7 year old son actually asked me, since i'm a girl now, if he's supposed to call me mom or something now. His mother and i divorced about a year and a half ago and he lives with me and visits her 1 weekend a month. I told him that i can understand if that's a bit awkward, since he has a mom already. I left it up to him what he was more comfortable with, and he said he wanted to still call me dad. That's fine, i said. So he still calls me dad,  but also genders me properly. "" My dad is a tattoo artist. She has a shop on the island. Her tattoos are pretty."" Etc. I told him that i appreciate him using she/her. He shrugged. Other people may get confused with his dad being a she, but it's no big deal to him.
I'm still mom to mine. And one of mine is also trans.
He talked with me about it,  I gave birth and mothered him, regardless of my gender.
His father is also a  trans woman,  so when my son legally changed his name, I got him a new boy-themed baby book. (I told him I was doing an art project and got his foot print and scanned it to a computer and sized it down, super cute!)
To me the roles of mom and dad aren't gendered, they are just usually thought of as being those genders.
But if another person feels and chooses differently,  I respect that too.
good kid
I love this so much. Dad isn’t about your gender for her. That’s just who you are. She knew you that way before she knew anything about gender. And she’ll correct anyone who misgenders you. The world is messed up—not your daughter. I haven’t transitioned but I would love to tell a story like this someday.
>""mom 2: electric Boogaloo""

This made my day
> mom 2: electric Boogaloo

I'm sorry, you did WHAT? That was OBVIOUSLY the right answer 😂😂😂
Yeah, ""Mom 2"" would have been epic!
Missed opportunity
""only after I vetoed ""mom 2: Electric Boogaloo"".""

That was a mistake
Your kids are my heros now
Thank you so much for sharing. This is exactly the kind of assurance I needed. I don't have anyone in my life who can even remotely relate to this problem.
I understand why you might want to keep the term dad, but going with a name like mom isn't in any way taking anything from your ex or replacing her. She doesn't get to dictate what you are called and what they children call you doesn't change her relationship to them. Cis lesbians manage the ""two moms"" situation just fine with the titles. The one who wasn't the birthing parent isn't called ""dad"" and the who gave birth isn't more entitled to any title. From what I've seen, they both have different titles that equally mean ""mother"". This situation might be considered different in some ways, but not fundamentally. 

That being said, if you like the term dad and it's what feels most right for you (disregarding others feelings) then you should not feel any negative feelings towards keeping that title. But if it makes you feel icky in any way, then you have the right to be called by a title that feels right for you.
“Glampa” is fantastic I love that.
Initial language development can very much incorporate the notion that there are more than two genders. By all means be he/him to your kid if that’s what you want, and also it’s not going to mess up your kid at all if you teach them baseline three pronoun choices from the get-go. (Diving into neopronouns if there’s no one around they immediately apply to  might be too high concept, but he/she/they is very doable)
This is epic tho 😆
My son made the same suggestion
Will second this- that was a mistake.
[deleted]
No it's my own personal feelings. I've been dad to them all along. Their feelings are more important than mine. My ex even asked what I'm going to have them call me. She didn't pressure me one way or the other. I also would feel awkward about it because of the fact they have called me dad all along. I even told my daughter she can call me Sarah or Dad out in public whichever she prefers, but not Mom. Again I just got out of a nasty divorce, I think the kids have had enough major changes for one year. 😂
TY :)
Oh yeah will not shy away from they/them pronouns, especially with standard grammar. Just sticking with what feels good when referencing to myself.
Regarding schools, I work in a UK private boys school and my presentation, title change and pronouns have all been accepted without question. Some have even been hugely enthusiastic about my changes as it shows their move towards diversity and I’m a visible presence of this. It has been a hugely positive experience and I’m now at the point where I can happily get on with my work without a second thought, just being me. I realise this is a blessing and not everyone will be able to do this, however I didn’t know it would be ok and had many reservations before I took the plunge.
I went to the top of the “boss tree” and let it filter down, changing my presentation gradually to give staff and students adjustment time. Two years on I’m presenting fully as me my confidence and standard of care/work has improved immeasurably. I’m a much more grounded person - I’d say calmer, but I work in a boys school so there’s still the usual nonsense to deal with; just because I’ve changed doesn’t mean others have! On the extra positive there have been two students at the school who have embraced their own gender identities and having an adult on the staff who is accepted by all can only be a good thing - Student mental health is a big concern and burying feelings and emotions on this level is, and has shown to be, very unhealthy.
Home life I can’t comment on as my partner has utterly embraced my changes, but again, with conversation, truth, love, and willing openness anything might be possible.
If it feels good for you, then that’s the most important thing. (I’m mum myself, even though I’m two gendered. Always wanted to be a ‘mum’. NOT mom. For some reason ‘mom’ makes me actively want to crawl out of my own skin. It’s one of my worst dysphoria triggers for some reason??)

So they put a Trans girl in the apartment next to me, and it's wild. Two completely different worlds.	"I'm gunna call this person Sherry.

Sherry, like me, is Transgender. I think it's weird that they put the Trans girls in the back corner of the complex, but whatever. I'm heiring (erring?) on the side of actual coincidence and not some weird form of segregation? Anyway.

Sherry and I come from two radically different backgrounds. Coming out was... not good for her. Sherry has been in rehab (and I think jail) for some hard drug use. Not a tooth in her skull. Has a live-in caretaker, is mostly deaf, chain smokes, raps Linkin Park and ICP on the porch at all hours of the day (it's not fantastic). Trouble with volume control. Confrontational. Self-inflicted bruises that she does for her OF account. Wants to pet every dog that passes by. Corrects people when they misgender her. Brought me and my son a Papa Murphy's pizza that she got with EBT. A caring, generous person. Desperate to prove her worth in a world that has shut her out and dismissed her.

By all accounts my life is different. When I came out to my parents I was not ostracized. I knew I was safe, I had support. Did get a divorce but you can't win them all, right? Overall, I'm safe, my life is good. I stick to the sidelines, I keep my head down, I stay out of the purview of others. I don't correct people when I'm misgendered. I would be invisible if I could.

Not Sherry. Sherry is loud as fuck. She says some Transmedical stuff to try to validate her own existence. ""I have XXY chromosomes, so I'm valid as a woman"". Because she's never known acceptance like I have. She hates her old persona and ridiculed him in front of me. I said maybe that person chose that life path to cope with something that ate them up inside. Maybe she should be gentle with herself and especially with her old self. He gave her everything he had. It wasn't much, but it was all of him. And now he's gone. He did that for her. This sentiment was completely new to her.

She likes to regularly talk about how she's kind and caring. If I had a drink for every time I heard the phrase ""that's just the kind of person I am"" I'd be Hunter S Thompson. Whereas she projects, I just outwardly and kinda openly hate myself. I hate being Trans. I don't want to be seen. I don't want to be validated. I just wanna disappear. I just wanna be a fighter. I just wanna stand up for myself. I just wanna rap Linkin Park on my porch at 3 in the morning. I just wanna tell people that I'm a good person even if I struggle to believe it. I just wanna ask if I can pet every dog that passes by. I just wanna be like Sherry.

I don't really know what the point of this is. I was going to journal it but I thought maybe it would mean something to someone else. She means a lot to me. She's resilient, she's the advocate for herself that I want to be.

If this isn't just some absolute bullshit for how the reception of your coming out can pivotally change the course of your life, I don't know what is. If you have a parent or parents that are Transphobic, homophobic, please be safe. Find a friend first, or a resource.

Anyway. I'm gunna make myself another one, y'all have a good night and you're valid and have you been working out? You're absolutely glowing."	"I’m sure Sherry sees you, living a quiet, independent life and raising your son, and she wishes she could be you too.
>She hates her old persona and ridiculed him in front of me. I said maybe that person chose that life path to cope with something that ate them up inside. Maybe she should be gentle with herself and especially with her old self. He gave her everything he had. It wasn't much, but it was all of him. And now he's gone. He did that for her. This sentiment was completely new to her. 

Genuinely I have not heard such a beautiful and empathetic statement, I wish everyone could hear or see this perspective of self compassion. I love the way you write and the words you had to say <3
It sounds like the both of you could learn a lot from each other. I suspect you both already have.
Thank you for sharing this 💖💖
This was actually really interesting to read. My coming out has been so different, that it just hits hard remembering there’s people who’s hole life changed because of the way they reacted. 

I really do hope Sherry can get help, specifically a therapist. 

(Also props to you for having a journal to write this kinda stuff in. Journaling can really help some people so I hope it’s been helping you)!
Damn onion cutting ninjas. Good luck to you both, and I hope you eventually get to a point where you feel safe to publicly affirm your gender and stand up for yourself. Scratch that, I know you will, just give it time. <3
I am cry, OP.

Your framing of things resonates with me. I'd say I am somewhere between both you and Sherry, and I wish I were even a little more like her.
Hey, just so you know, you're valid too. We're all different, and we all look at others and think 'damn, I wish I could be more like them'. Somebody looks at you that way, you inspire them, and you can be proud of that. Don't sell yourself short on what you think you should be or do.
This was great to read!!  <33  thanks for sharing :))
very interesting slice of life there, thanks for sharing <3
I'm fairly close to a transmasc version of sherry honestly, and seeing your perspective of her is... very comforting.
Thanks for sharing 💜🫶🏼
This is kind of poetic.  

Give Nevada by Imogen Binnie a read, if you have a chance. It's a book written by a trans woman, about a trans woman. And there are some diatribes in there that are very similar to the one you're describing here. You might relate to it.  

And thank you for sharing your story!
this is really nice to read. thanks for sharing OP!
You have a talent for writing. You honored Sherry with this post. I respect your will to hide, but please consider bringing more of your words to light. Please.
(Ps: not part of this beautiful community, was scrolling and I am glad this caught my eye).
This is really moving. Thanks for sharing
It sounds to me like you're both good influences for each other.
so does she refer to her old self as ""he/him""?
This is an awesome story and sounds like the plot of a trans Mitch Albom novel or something!
How cool would it be if op had DID and sherry is her altar and she imagines the personalities live in different apartments when they share the light..

M. Night shamolanalawn
With dick or no dick some pople gonna be a dick.
She sounds like my ghost of Christmas future! Well that suggests I’ll ever properly transition at all! HAHAhaheheeh… fuck. Either she sounds lovable heh
There really is a huge breadth of experience among transgender people. I'm glad the two of you are getting along, rather than not being able to do so.

> heiring (erring?)

Erring. It comes from the same linguistic root as ""error"".
That's really kind. I don't know what direction you travel on this Trans journey but please respect him/her that came before you. They literally and figuratively gave their life for you, because you deserve it! Thank them. Be patient with them. Don't hate them. Because they loved you. I do too.
I'm definitely going to remind my girlfriend of this when she sees photos of herself pre-transition or says mean things about how she used to be.
I had goosebumps reading this. Truly beautiful.
not sure what good it did/does but it felt important to honor her. <3
Ha my mom asked me if I was still journaling or if I keep a diary now that I'm living as a woman.
That's wonderful, I'm glad you were able to take something good from it. <3
Yes, as do I.
Wdym cool?
We get along great. She's a riot, I'm the quiet. Thanks for the cl**err**ification! That's why they pay you the big bucks.
I get that this is a helpful way to think about it for you, and that makes it useful and meaningful.

It doesn’t work like this for some of us; and is for some of us an actively harmful thing to say.

Describe it like that for yourself - that’s awesome that you’ve found a way to contextualise something that makes it less painful for you! - I would suggest avoiding making it sound like a universal thing, though.

To my mind; I am the only me that ever existed. There was no person who came before me - the person people thought I was was simply a mask over pain. I’m still the same person I was before; just a happier and less hurting version.
I'm actually really glad I transitioned late instead of as a teen, much as I'd love to have the body and looks I'd have gotten if I did. It gave me the chance to spend half my life as a boy and the next half as a girl. It gives me a unique viewpoint most don't get the chance to experience. I'm proud as fuck of being trans. You can't misgender me because I don't have a gender. I'm something new, created from sheer force of will. Someone who looked at the hand fate dealt them and said fuck this, I want to try again. That person I was before, they always were and always will be a part of that. The part that comes out to defend me when threatened, the armor that shields me from petty insults, the strength to deal with situations I might not otherwise be able to. I may not be that person anymore, but they'll always be there if I need them.
I too love this perspective, and now I’m trying to not cry into my lunch ❤️
It was a hard habit for me to crack until one of you kind redditors gave me the perspective that I shared here, and it has given me a completely new outlook that I really, really needed.
Awe, no you! I really hope you do gain some comfort from the comments and the community in general. You'll get there! I still struggle with it myself, but I do generally correct people when they misgender me, for example. :) 

If I'm being honest, I was pretty startled that someone would never correct others when they get misgendered, partially because I know it can be done casually as well if you're not confrontational like me.
I completely understand we have different perspectives and experiences, I didn't mean to invalidate yours unintentionally. 

I heard specific words from her that I use myself when describing pre-transition or pre-coming out, like ""that guy was X"" or ""he did Y"". I felt it was safe to include that because she showed a lot of targeted anger toward a former persona as I did, and I just wanted to share what helped me get through that.
100% I read OPs story and I couldn't even comprehend what they were saying. Like there's only ever been one me, I'm just a much happy me then I was in the past.
I felt the same, I'm me, and always have been. I don't owe anything to the unhappy version of myself because that's just me.
Yaaaas this!
This is YOUR story and YOUR thread. Ofc it is okay"	xwxc0r	trans	612	0.99	2022-10-06 05:37:00
Can’t post on AITA because “trans bad”- AITA for cutting off my mom after my Father and Brother treat me like a predator after coming out as trans.	"Hi, I am a 33 year old born female who came out as trans-masc during the pandemic. I got top surgery and am on hormone therapy and have been living my life as my true self. 

Well, when I tried to tell my family things were not easy. My mother didn’t want to use my preferred name so I gave her a second option but she continues to misgender me and not use the preferred names I have given. She recently bought a bottle of wine with my dead name on it during thanksgiving and presented it to me like I would appreciate it since my dead name spelled differently is a man’s name in another language. 

I laughed it off and kept asking when the kids were going to arrive. Since I was told they were coming down despite my brother and I having a huge argument because he refuses to tell me where his new house is and I am not allowed to visit. My brother 34 has 4 children now and the new baby was welcomed in August. I have not met this baby, (her middle name is a Harry Potter Character) but I brought her a gift in an attempt to make peace. I have no issues with his wife other then her spineless attempts to excuse my brothers bigotry because he has said out loud he doesn’t want me talking to his kids about sex. When I was only coming out as a trans man to them.

To understand better, with the first two kids I was changing their diapers. Playing with them for hours on end and the oldest misses me dearly. This was when I was in the closet. Baby 3 was born during the pandemic and I wanted to visit but they barred me from the house claiming Covid. 

Well my brother didn’t show up for thanksgiving, but I called the next day and he was there with the kids. I heard the oldest ask who was on the phone.  They didn’t answer her, I felt like a stranger holding the phone to my ear hearing them all play and celebrate the holiday without me. 

I made plans to return home to cut my moms hair the next day. However I was talking to a local trans artist and decided to confront my mom about what happened. 

What followed was a heart breaking phone call about my mental health and how it has declined to depression, isolation and grief. We are still mourning the loss of my oldest brother who died after thanksgiving in 2015. He would have accepted me. Now My mom feels like she is loosing another child. 

But, when I confronted my dad over the phone he proceeded to not only miss gender me and refused to call me by any name. he told me that my brother doesn’t see me as anything but his sister and that they are struggling to understand because all they see me as their little girl. my dad has continuously left me out of any of the activities with my brother I wasn’t allowed to go fishing wasn’t allowed to go golfing and when I would join them they always complained that I was slow and I couldn’t keep up and there was always a gang mentality of “little girls” can’t play with the boys.

My dad told me in the car that gender affirming surgery would be a Mutilation of my body. 

My dad told me MY BROTHER DOESN’T SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENDER AND SEXUALITY

i strongly believe my dad is to blame here. So I told my mom I will never be returning home again. She cried and asked me what she can do to help. I don’t think anything can be because I can’t trust my brother or father ever again. AITA?

Update: thank you all for your support I have been revolving around the guilt of coming out and it’s good to know that I deserve to be treated better. Also my sister in law texted me thanking me for the gift against the wishes of my brother so I’m thinking I’ve struck a nerve finally.

Update 2: So after blocking my father and mother from contacting me. My dad showed up unannounced to drop off my snow tires and apologize for snapping on me over the phone. Apparently he sent me an email but I blocked him long ago because his last apology was just more bigotry hidden within manipulative apologetic behaviour. I had my fiancé talk to him and deal with the tires while I cried on my patio. 

My brother says The reason he won’t let me see the kids. Is all I talk about is drama and trans stuff. And I don’t take the time to talk to them about positive things. 

It’s absolutely nuts to think I would be so stupid to fall for this. They are uncomfortable with me being transgender and don’t want me to talk about it at all even though I only came out at 30 and I just turned 33 in September. 

I have had little contact with them over Covid and saw my brother once since the start of the pandemic. He doesn’t respond to text messages to me and when he does it’s always drama because he doesn’t invite me to family event he gets our mother to invite me. Mom had to fight for me to be involved in his wedding.  He’s bullied me since I was a baby (in the youngest of 3 our older brother passed away in 2015) his wife was the only one who would share pictures or stories of the kids over text because they don’t use social media. I admit i have snapped at him repeatedly, but I know it’s from being gaslit. He’s the one who showed our neighbour how to unlock the bathroom door while I was using it."	"You transitioning wasn’t what made them “lose another child” it was the way they treated you.
NTA by far.
NTA - always cut people out of your life who harm you.
100% NTA. If your family can't support and affirm you, they don't get to spend time with you. Natural consequences. Boundaries like this have really helped with my family.
NTA - It’s okay to not want to be around people who hurt you. Even if those people are related to you by blood.
NTA misgenderers get the yeet
NTA at all
Nah, family isn’t the end all be all. I hope you can find a better family for yourself
Not at all , not seen my family In over 8 years because of it and I've been mentally better off ever since
They have no rights to your well-being once they become the reason your being isn’t well. You want some internet parents r/momforaminute and r/dadforaminute are both places I have had success with even when I made it clear I’m trans both have love unconditionally as a rule so you can report transphobia to mods
When she cried, you should have told her - gender you correctly, strictly, 100 percent of the time. If she hesitated then cut her out with no mercy. 


But this works too. 

Nta. Obviously.
NTA - family is hurtful and you. Need. To. Cut. All. Of. Them. Off!
NTA.

Family deserves an extra few chances, but you GAVE them LOTS of chances and they royally fucked up. Leave em, at least for a while.
Hate to say it, but your family is full of ignorant transphobes.

Your one and only answer to your mother should be “you all had exactly two options. Acceptance or rejection. You all chose rejection. Real genuine acceptance, and educating yourself on what being transgender actually is, is the only way any of you will ever see me again.”
No, go live your own life with someone who loves you
Self preservation is NOT SELFISH. You did what YOU needed. YOU DESERVE PEACE. Your job first and foremost is to live your life for yourself.
NTA, even though family: this behavior is not acceptable.

I am sorry for you. Best wishes!
NTA - Just because they're blood doesn't mean they're family. A family loves you, cares about your well-being, wants you to be happy, and, most importantly, **RESPECTS YOU**!! From the description, they've done none of that. They're just blood-relatives/ kin.
NTA - All I see is a story about how your family thinks they own you and the choices you make for yourself. If they feel like they're losing a child, it's not because they're worried about you, it's because they're losing their power over you. They want to guilt trip you into being what they want out of their kid, not what's right for you. They can either learn to accept it or get cut out because their toxicity will only be a drain on you.
NTA. Passively letting people be horrible bigots to you is not acceptable from someone who claims to be family.
NTA - your family is incredibly rude and not supportive. they have no right to treat you like that.
You can't make AITA posts about being trans?
Definitely NTA!! Cut toxic people out of your life!
Nta. Still hurts though im sorry
You know what every time that cis men have left me out and been toxic like that I realized I didn’t even want to be associated with their values so I ended up being okay with them not accepting me. Idk if that makes sense but it makes sense in my head. Basically I’m sorry that you have faced so much rejection. Just know that there are really wonderful people and wonderful uplifting men that will accept you out there.
sorry, what does NTA and AITA mean? 🧍
NTA, you are finally getting to be yourself, they don’t have the right to weaponize that against you to appease their bigotry.
Nta. Your fam =TA
Are they really that transphobic on other subreddits?
Wait does AITA have a “Trans Thing”? This is the first i heard of such a thing
NTA. You’ve gone out of your way to connect and reconnect and to offer patient explanations to people who have done nothing to deserve it. The idea that the loss of your oldest brother somehow justifies this is just… appalling. Your family has the opportunity to keep a real, living relationship with one of its members, and they’re just going to light that on fire, because you won’t sign off on their mistreatment of you? 

You deserve better than that.
Cut them all off. If they can’t accept you for you, they lost a wonderful son.
You are so NTA! Them miss gendering fills me with rage. Parents are allowed to mourn the person they thought you were but then need to move on. You are being your true self. You do not need those negative people in your life treating you like you are less than. Sometimes you have to make a different family with friends who love you as the wonderful person you are.
NTA.
NTA and your relatives suck.
I was also not allowed to post there for the same reason.
If I was in your shoes, I’d be cutting them out of my life completely until they can respect and use your pronouns and real name.
You’re still alive. They’re mourning their concept of you. Happy you’re loving your truth, brother. NTA
NTA you don't want that toxicity in your life
Had to cut my toxic and racist family as well nta totally agree 👍💯 NTA.
NTA. if they want their perfect idea of their little daughter more than they want their actual child, the idea is all they deserve.
NTA
All that extra text was unnecessary, title was enough. NTA, never were or will be
I'm so sorry for you being cut off from the children here. I have a brother that cut off my entire side of the family (not related to my transition or anything else), so I have a niece and nephew that I didn't get to see grow up.

You're absolutely not wrong for protecting yourself from these people, though. You don't owe them anything despite what they think.

Some people will always see you as the version of yourself they had the most control over. Especially if you allow them to control you in any way. Setting firm boundaries is important, and starting with a boundary of cutting them off completely is completely rational.

Jfc, I can't believe your your brother won't even tell you his address. What a fucking asshole.
This sounds really toxic. You might tell your mom at least that what she can do to help is use your name and gender you correctly. I don't think your an asshole for not wanting to go back to that environment, though.

Put it this way, you're cutting out your family but they're also choosing to cut out you by being shitbags about this. That's on them, not you. You aren't obligated to take emotional abuse from anyone, family or not.
NTA, and i would cut your family out of your life.  as hard as that might be, it's worth it for your mental health.
NTA. Sounds like your mom wants you to stick around while allowing your brother and dad to treat you with absolute disrespect

What can she do? She can have a discussion with her husband and her son otherwise she *will* lose another child. See how important it really is to them
NTA, and you don't need your mom if she enables/ignores their gross behavior
They're the assholes.  I am sorry.  Family that turn you away are horrible, and sometimes cutting them out of your life is what you have to do in order to be happy.  If your mom is worth holding on to.  I would just plan on keeping phone contact and maybe doing some outings with her each year.  Separately.  As for the rest of the family.  I would cut them out and leave it up to them to change their minds.  If they truely are worth interacting with then perhaps they will over time sulking in their own shit.  But otherwise I wouldn't worry one second of my life what they think about you.  I've had to cut close family out of my life and it SUCKS.  But I'm better for it and happier at the end of the day
It sounds like this doesn't have anything to do with your transition, your dad is just a sexist pig. NTA.
Am I the asshole blocks certain things that are deemed ‘contraversial’

So often it’s related to several areas such as sex (like the physical act) gender, race and other issues that are ‘hot’ at the moment
not the asshole period, its mature to set your boundaries you did the right thing
NTA

The blood of the brotherhood is thicker than the water of the womb.

Find your real family and cut those bio assholes out of your life.
NTA: if mom wants to help she needs to get herself and the whole family therapy and accept you for who you are 

Everything else has pretty much already been said: cut them off until they can prove to you they've changed. Personally I'd give it like a few years at minimum

Also as a side note I knew AITA was a big online community and wouldn't be the friendliest to trans ppl but damn I didn't know they're that much of a dick
Definitely NTA. You get to decide who gets to be part of your life, and if your family refuses to accept you as who you are, you have every right to cut them out
NTA - trans or otherwise, you don't owe anyone your life. If someone in your life is making it so that you feel like life is unmanageable or too hard, you are always allowed to take your space with or without warning, with or without explanation, etc. I had to cut my own family off when I was 20 because they also told me trans bad, and I knew I needed time to figure out what I wanted and who I am, and that to do this I had to stop hearing all those bitches in my head that sound *just like me*, but want me dead. I needed a silent room, or at least one without all those echos and feedback sounds, ever the painful reminder me who definitely wasn't.

Remember: you are too important to not live and be true. It's not just about you. It is Us, right now, the people who are alive and have a voice, one of the few peoples who can change the world by simply being ourselves. And we ARE responsive for changing the world for the better, not just as a minority, but as human beings who is a part of this world and wish to find peace while still in it.

Please believe that you deserve to be surrounded by *only* loving people who respect you. That should be your bare minimum for allowing a person into your life from now on, you'll feel a lot better a lot faster if you don't have to work against the grain inside that head of yours. Cognitive dissonance does not have to be your neutral state anymore. Being trans isn't a choice, but loving yourself is, and it is so worth it when you finally start to feel it. I'm 23 now, and about 2 months ago I finally realized I am no longer plagued with suicidal ideations, in fact, I now want to live. I deserve to live, and to have my chance at happiness too, damn it, and you do too. You are so deserving of love. I wish you all the best
NTA. Your mental health is worth the stress. Sometimes stuff like this makes people change. Other times, you are relieved of being around it. I’m sorry you’re going through this.
So sorry to hear you have to go through that. If you have any patience left, pull it out because you’ll need it - so many people are ignorant and misinformed. Time and distance really do heal things. Give it time also., on your part to be who you are and on their part to wrestle with their own ignorance.
First of all, NTA. Second of all, that sub sucks major dick, especially recently. The mods are overzealous as fuck.
See this is a weird one cuz it kinda seems like your mom's atleast trying but your dad and brother are making it impossible. I'd almost ask is there a way to keep contact with mom but cut out dad and brother but probably not
I don’t need to read the context of this to conclude that you are NOT the asshole. That shit is not acceptable, and you deserve to associate yourself with people who support you.
NTA and you don't owe any of them a relationship. You deserve better than to be treated like that.
NTA, in fact, they are assholes for treating you like crap, I would honestly stop trying to make amends with them if I were you tbh
Your brother and dad are abusive.
Maybe you can continue a relationship with your mom, just not in that house?
Best case scenario is getting through a bit to your mom but that seems mentally taxing so idk
NTA, my family only started to accept that I was trans when I cut them off. They saw just how much happier I was without them and how much healthier I was living as myself. Theres still some strain there but they are trying. 



You may need to be a bit more understanding about how they feel like theyre losing a kid, my family felt the same, but its not your responsibility to hold their hand. If they want you back they fix their shit. Until then get a breath of fresh air, and try and stay positive. 



Your mom sounds a lot like mine, and my mom has been a fight to get on my side but a rock once she was. It may not seem like it but the different ver of ur name is likely a sign shes starting to take baby steps forward. Since my mom would 100% kick the asses of my dad and brothers (figuratively) if they were causing her to lose me I think yours very well could do the same.
NTA they’re treating you as sub human and making themselves pissed. All by making up/listening to untrue reasons, to justify their knee jerk reaction of discomfort. You deserve so much better then people that are unwilling to make you feel loved. Especially if it would only cost them slight discomfort to understand you.
this! ^ NTA
this
absolutely they should NTA
Over the phone I was gentle, but followed up with a text message with very direct language about my name and gender and that they need to learn to respect the trans community
You can
AITA - “Am I The Asshole?”
NTA - “Not The Asshole”
AITA - Am I the asshole

NTA - Not the asshole
This is code from the subreddit “am I the asshole?” (AITA) and NTA means “not the asshole”.
AITA: Am I The Asshole?

NTA: Not The Asshole

There is a sub based around asking reddit if you made the jerk moves or if it was other people (or both/neither), OP apparently had trouble with that sub and came here to ask instead.

In this case OP did absolutely nothing wrong, his family are just assholes hence people are saying that he is ""not the asshole"".
AITA: Am I The Asshole

NTA: Not The Asshole

ATA: Am The Asshole
“Not the asshole” and “am I the asshole”
NtA- not the asshole 
AITA- am I the asshole
NTA = not the asshole, AITA = am I the asshole
Not the asshole 

Am I the asshole, its a sub reddit where people ask if they were an ass in a situation or not or if someone else is.
Subreddit “am I the asshole”

Answer “not the asshole”
damn reddit didn’t give me the notifs, also thank you all 👍
Oh god yes. Any trans-related post in literally any subreddit that’s not trans-specific gets swarmed by transphobes.
The censorship on that board is unbelievable
That's awful
Yea it kinda blows. I find the best way to deal with it (aside from just avoiding all non-trans subs) is to make fun of them and make them look stupid so people take them less seriously. It’s usually pretty easy cuz they generally don’t expect trans people or their allies to do stuff like that."	y3t6ij	trans	594	0.98	2022-10-14 12:53:30
I tried to be happy but I so scared that people will make fun of me for being “me” (I get misgendered to a f tonne that I tell of people in public then I would cry in public). Here are some photos before I got mad.		"Who the fuck is looking at you and seeing anything but woman?
I'm legit confused why and how would anyone misgender you. You look and are so pretty and more like a woman than many cis women I know.
Know the feeling darl. There is such a disconnect with how I see myself vs how others see me. Stay strong and know you're gorgeous x
Look how pretty you are!
There is just something wrong with the people who misgender you cause you look wonderful and pass amazingly
You are stunning! Sorry you're being treated like that.
Misgender people back, that's what I do. Nothing better than calling an old male bigot Janice and watching how pissed they get. If someone makes fun of you so what? It has no power over you if you give it no power. They want you to cry, they want you to feel bad. Fuck em all. Be happy and piss them off.
You look very feminine. The only reason I could think that you are being misgendered is your voice or mannerisms. Voice is such an important factor in whether we are read as male or female. Would you be comfortable posting a voice clip? Or if you feel it’s your voice look into voice therapy or surgery?
had to make sure you weren’t a trans masc who hasn’t started transitioning yet. You are a beautiful woman, i definitely echo voice training
Hello new crush 😳 screw those people. They’re jealous at how amazing you look
honestly have no idea how many misgendered you. Unless your voice betrays you. It’s the only thing I can think of. But sweetie. You are a gorgeous woman. Be proud. You are legit gorgeous and your outfits on point.
Imma start throwing hands for you on god!
So beautiful!
lovely 🎈
Dear you look beautiful don’t let other people dictate your beauty and appearance and happiness dear enjoy your beauty and happiness 😘😘🥰🥰🤗🤗👩❤️
If someone misgenders that gorgeous face then they are blind and dumb. You got this girl!!!
You look like a beautiful woman. You’d have to tell me you were trans
From my perspective, i bet a majority of people who do that to you are envious, jealous that you have worked hard to present as a female/woman.  Rise above that and love yourself.
How do you see a man there? If I saw you in person and didn't know this was a trans subreddit I would say you where born female
Look good to me 😁
You are very gorgeous.
What a sweet smile you have!
Such a cutie!
Be happy to spite the haters. Let them keep their hate.
You're beautiful and wonderful!
Girl you look way too good for any sane person to misgender
Girl you're hella pretty I'm jealous 😭 screw them, you do you❤️
you’re beautiful. don’t let insecure people bring you down 🏳️‍⚧️💘
Mis gendered ??? HOWWW???!!! Likee
Literally HOWWW!!! I Don’t see anything but a women ?? How would anyone ?? Uhh wha??

I almost don’t want to believe you bc you pass

But you still look so good, you pass 

The only thing MAYBE?? Is the eyes? They look tierd? But like you can’t change that ? 
Maybe your voice? But idk i haven’t heard you before Soo idk 

But your a pass in my book
Beauty.
very nice  never give up. if we cannot bask in our own peronal development and beliefs were even more a prisoner in society . love and hugs there wll be more better days than not
You are flipping beautiful. Pretty sure you are a top 1% of attractive women in any room you are in. I see nothing that clocks you. Some people are just filled with hate.
People are always gonna hate. We just need you show we don’t give af. Misgendering, fuck em. You don’t need their respect because they obviously could never share space with you💖
Well you look very cis to me. You actually remind me of an old friend :)
You are absolutely gorgeous don’t let people’s hate of themselves ruin the person you are. Live your life to make you happy because that’s all that matters. Be yourself you are a beautiful woman
You must live in a super conservative place. Your outfits, makeup, and hair are always on point. By the way your new hair is gorgeous as I said last time 😊
Esp now there are bigots that kinda look for us so they can insult us. Jealous woman tends to do this also..🥺

But you're very passable so if you get misgendered it's from that it's not because you're not pretty. 

It's difficult being hurt by anyone for no reason that's the part I have trouble with.  
🤗🤗🤗🤗❤️
Not going to lie, you're my transition goals now.
I LOVR your look girl! :) Keep on being you. The world became a better place when you decided to be you ❤️
They’re probably just mad that you’re more put together and beautiful than most of the women they know. How they know you’re trans is where I’m confused. I wouldn’t know just seeing you and I am trans too so I feel like I notice things other people wouldn’t. They’re just looking for people to hate at this point because their lives are miserable. If I do notice another trans person I just go out of my way to be gender affirmative.
Yeah you still gorgeous anyway! I love who you are I respect it
Gorgeous!
You are beautiful and just remember that no matter what pronouns someone calls you, you are the one who knows who you truly are. If they don’t respect you and your pronouns, they can just F off.
Girl you look absolutely stunning. They just hate you because your had the courage to be yourself rather then what society tells you to be.
As far as FFS,take your time and decide what you want to change. Find a surgeon that will work with you and is recommended by bunches of others. Do whatever makes you happy with yourself.
No one can actually take away who you are. If they could then pushing cis gender identity on us would actually work. No matter what others say you're you.

If passing matters to you, you've nailed it.
Oh girl! You are so beautiful! I know it's hard but don't let the haters get you down. You are trying to be happy and live your authentic life and that is the most important thing.
Beautiful
I've been where u are so if I may, let me offer some advice for you to consider.  Before I do though let me say you look amazing and clearly you know how to put together a look.   However, it might be simply too good for what you're tying to accomplish.

There was a time when I was getting ""clocked"" often and couldn't figure out why.  Then it hit me......I was overdressed for where I was going and the hair was just too perfect which kept me from blending in.   Where I live, women will go to the mall in the most casual clothes they own.   As soon as I stopped dressing to look ""great"" and dumbed it down with jeans or a skirt just above the knee, a t-shirt with tennis shoes and putting my hair up under a baseball cap I found my way.  I learned that a successful trip to the mall (or anywhere else for that matter) was NOT drawing attention to myself by looking dressed up with an awesome hair style.  

Women don't care about what other women look like if they're wearing the most basic stuff to go out in public and very little makeup, but as soon as you dress it up, do your hair perfectly and look amazing......they're ready to inspect every little thing about you and judge you.  

You're a very passable girl.......hang in there.  It may feel tough right now but I'm cheering for you and I believe you'll figure this stuff out.
Fr!! I'm trans and I have a horrible habit of trying to pick out other trans people in crowds cause I was raised conservative and my parents would always do it.  But honestly I wouldn't even take a second look at you honey!  You look gorgeous (⁠ ⁠╹⁠▽⁠╹⁠ ⁠).  I hope that makes you feel a bit better.
They do it on purpose because they don’t want to validate our existence
I think someone is just fishing for compliments with this post.
It's the hands. There's no surgery to change hand size and length of the fingers.
My mom tells me I need only hairline and that’s it but I know that I need to get forehead nose and chin done. My mom would say do you want to look notched like that tv shows. I have saved up a lot for surgery but I’m torn between two halves ma I get treat like crap in public  with people talking about me and sometime I get it wrong accusing people for talking about me but I’m on edge of my seat. I wish I had never ask those staff me ever if they were laughing about me because they probably weren’t.

I’m just not used to people.

I feel as though surgery would help me substantially. 

I was told by grandad to do walking lessons and voice then do surgery if you want to but would not even be supportive about it. 

I’m stuck. 

I just want honesty.
I’m trying to not be rude. That’s why I only ask if they were laughing at me or talking about me. I don’t want to stoop to their level.
Definitely looking into voice training but I don’t know if it actually works. I’m also going to buy those Hera breast forms so I can feel more comfortable and prepared for the surgery (FFS surgery). I was told that I need to practice my walk or do ballet classes.
Most of the time when I walk past young adults. People who have gone to the beach and the trouble makers who act foolish. And rich folks would make fun of me. Or people who look better than me. I saw a couple kissing on the tram standing and kissing each other right next to me as if they want me to notice them. Eshays who would try to be edgy and say mean things behind my back. Junkies and homeless druggies would perv at me and I feel like crap because it makes me feel like I’m only attractive to junkies smh. It’s horrible.
Thank you 🙏
I’ll try but it’s not easy.
Could it be my male gaze?
Was in the city
Thank you
As a kid your conservative parents would always try and pick out trans people in public crowds. Around what decade was this, seems unbelievable.
[deleted]
Yes because you're the only human who doesn't crave validation. How enlightened of you.
Not being a jerk costs zero dollars my dude
I’d start with not going to unqualified cis people for advice. People are saying voice training, that’s an absolutely massive factor there’s no other way around it. 

Past that, I can only say what I relate to. I’m pretty tall relative to female height especially outside of Europe, and have had to figure out what clothing works well on my silhouette, which seemingly overlaps with yours a fair bit. And this might sound pretty abstract but trying to phrase this type of stuff with just text is difficult.

You’re a big woman from the looks for the first few photos, but wearing little woman clothing. The cardigan and bag and to a lesser extent shirt in the photos are little woman clothing. They kinda shrink physique, which looks cute on smaller girls but once you’re tall enough broad enough whatever it just looks off. Same with how the shirt is cropped, if we can’t see the edges of the collar here and the cardigan is what’s doing that it’s actually making you look *more* broad believe it or not. And in your case the hairstyle while dope is also loud, so your legs and shoes look fine (black boots and leggings work with all physiques and silhouettes), hair and face presentation looks cool, model height, but then the mall girl torso clothing throws it off. If you had an oversized *and thicker cut fabric* maybe brown sweater, and a bag that looks louder/more distinct and has a thicker strap (this part about the strap is a really big deal. That thinner strap size is literally relative to look good on smaller girls), the fit is totally cohesive now. Past this, I’m just some internet rando who made one comment, I’d go to fashionable girlfriends you have (ideally tall girls) and see what sort of advice and brutally honest feedback they have to give on outfits

Tbh I don’t think the fashion aspect is really necessary if one has a passing voice, but think it’s worth mentioning. And if those pieces you’re wearing make you happy then fuck what I say, none of this is taking into account the personal feelings of the individual, which is the most important thing in personal style and fashion
Going to be 100% honest, I can't see how you'd get clocked by looks alone. How does your voice sound? Personally Ive seen ultra passing trans women who I can clock as MTF because their voice still has a masculine tone to it. I have not heard your voice, and I'm not going to judge that, just that's the only thing I can think of. Like, if passed by you irl, my first instinct is that you're just another woman, can't really tell you were amab.
Well then honestly, you're mum's a bit of a bitch. I understand the desire to pass, duh lol. Surgery isn't a cure all. Trans people will still be clocked after FFS, BA etc. It's important that decisions to change our bodies in such ways are made because it's something we want for ourselves, to make us more comfortable in our own skin, not for the benefit of others, not to try and blend in. That might be a factor, but it should be secondary. 

Idk wtf walking lessons is lol. Do men and women walk a particular way? That just sounds like a person would end up walking in an exaggerated female fashion that comes off look very fake. Voice training is obviously a long process that takes commitment, time and effort to pay off but does help people pass.

I also understand what you mean about being very sensitive to people around you. As someone who does not pass, I have a hair trigger for that sort of thing, especially because I work in a very public setting around dozens of people. It's not a healthy mindset to be in. I try to cope by telling myself that what's important is that I'm happy in my own skin.

For what it's worth, I think you're gorgeous. It's so easy to get in our heads and have a dysphoria spiral. When people tell you you're pretty, listen to them because they're not just saying it to make you feel better x
You are a much better person than I am. I personally will always be Ryde to rude people. I have a thick skin and they don't bother me really. I just make them feel how they tried to make me feel. Taste of their own medicine.
There is an entire profession that is devoted to changing your voice. It works. Find a good speech pathologist and you’ll be golden. Mine specialized in trans voices and he helped tremendously.
Voice therapy is definitely cheaper than voice surgery. I didn’t really get oh with therapy so I had voice surgery which is on my profile. I’m now having post therapy which is somewhat helpful in stamina and raising my voice higher. I think they also do classes for women etiquette as well as trans women.
No problem girl we gotta have each others backs out here 💜
Life is about ups and downs the best times in life require self-determination and effort.  Learned along the way to adapt to changes in personal vital needs
You underestimate how shit people can be.  My dad calls them ""chicks with dicks"" and says their destroying America.  He still does it but I remember him starting around 2014 when trans and gay people were in the media more.  In the town I grew up in there was a guy who drove a box truck with racist and homophobic slurs written on the side, most of them followed by ""your going to burn in hell"". That guy was friends with the police, and he parked his truck in the middle of town all the fucking time, no one ever stopped him.  America is still quite homophobic and transphobic in some places.  I'm barely 2 decades old and I've been called the f slur many times by people my age.
I mean I have a family member that isn’t conservative, is gay and pagan and not too long ago they were in a call with a friend and started talking about how they don’t get, “they/them pronouns” and started making transphobic jokes. Even said something about “theybies” but I’m not sure what it was bc eventually I had to put in my earbuds bc I knew if I confronted them about it I’d accidentally out myself soooo

Plus they were being so loud I could barely hear my video and that’s was just as nerve wracking considering I was in the opposite room.

Plus they’ve said on multiple occasions in not so many details about how trans ppl are going against the gods bc the gods gave them that gender for a reason. So yea some ppl are just fucking assholes. Makes it even worse is that they were born around the time Stonewall happened.
Transphobes don’t make sense. They just hate
Not to take away from op's frustration -- I wish I looked that good -- but proportions of things like straps, accessories, even cuffs and collar width is crucial.  Plus size has the same problem though there's more choices than used to be.  In my 20s being trans was overwhelming but (considering the other things I have made time for since)  I wish I had learned to sew and design my own clothes.
I sound like a guy or butch lesbian. It’s creating discomfort when I’m in work situations too. I feel out of place and draggy. Shudders. Is it too late to train my voice?
I used to think this way same as you but it will only make me feel like crap because it’s not who I am. 

It doesn’t stop people from thinking that we’re crazies in the street and are equivalent to junkies.

Man if only Jim Crow (or creator of) were real person he would only be the person I would yell at. Tomato juice and all lol.
I’m prioritising ffs surgery because I thought that I need a bit if work done. Then later on my boobs so I can replace the breast forms (i want 38C). Do you know any surgeon who could produce natural result that doesn’t look fake (for ffs surgery)? Anyone have ideas?
Love me some down votes for trying to help lol
As a person from the south I can confirm shit like that happens here.
It's never too late to start voice training. I won't tell you it's easy though. It's a learned skill, kinda like playing an instrument. Personally I have been voice training for roughly 5mo, and while I know my voice still can sound fairly masculine (especially when I forget to use it), but I can clearly tell a difference between how I used to sound vs how I sound now. 

There's an app called voice tools that helped me track this greatly. It will show your tone, pitch (and whether it's male/female or androgynous range), and also a little story you can read, which will then show you what % was more masc to fem. Seeing fem overtake masc overtime is highly euphoric. Additionally, videos on YouTube (a popular one is trans voice lessons) can help a ton. It won't be instantaneous, but you will see progress as long as you keep at it!

Finally, you are absolutely stunning hun! I couldn't even dream if being as beautiful as you are. And if people talk and have opinions, that's all they are. In the grand scheme of things, thier opinions shouldn't hold any weight on your happiness of being a woman (I know it's *super* difficult to basically stop caring what others think, but if you can get past that hurdle, or even work your way towards it will help immensely)

I wish you all the best hun! Hopefully you managed to pull *something* useful from this 😁🏳️‍⚧️💜
It's never too late. There's tons of voice training online that you can practice with, or if you have the money you can try seeing a vocal coach. You don't need to have the most perfectly feminine voice but voice training does help with passing.
I'm a veteran so I am probably much less inclined to deal with idiots than the average person. The military gave me a thick skin and the ability to shut down stupidity as quickly as possible. I hit em back quick with their own bs and keep moving. It's the same thing I do with other crazies. Tell me the moon landing was fake and I tell em the are a sheep for thinking yhe moon is real, tell me a second gunman killed JFK and I tell em JFK was a lizard man from Mars. Earth is flat, lol its all a simulation. Misgender me I misgender em back. 

Always gotta throw them off to shut it down.
If you want to consider ffs r/Transgender_Surgeries has a lot of discussion and a wiki.

Agree with the suggestion of ballet, it helped my daughter.  Other forms of dance (belly dance is usually very gender positive if you have a good studio in your area) probably good too.
Yeah you get it.  Living in the south as someone LGBT or a racial group that isn't white is quite the fucking experience.  Everyone wants to try and convert you to Christian, hurt you, or just be generally sarcastic towards you.  The best part is the questions, like ""are you one of them drags?"", ""Y'all can't be dressed like that theres children around"".  I love the south cause so many parts of it are beautiful and I want to die here but damn the people can really be awful.
I second voice tools(as well as the rest of this post. It's been useful if not cringey to hear myself back. I pass on the phone pretty much 100% of the time, in person around 80% voice wise, although I want my jaw and browline done. Other than that, I'll just say this, which I've said before on here: slay isn't just an appearance, it's your state of mind, the confidence to live as the human you are. There is so much time for you to get the little things done but YOU have to do it. It's a scary world for us out there, so we have to be fierce. My state government currently wants to crush us, so we have to be strong. There are people who would gladly cause great harm physically and emotionally to us, so we have to be willing to fight if necessary. But at the end of the day, we are who we are, and no one can take that from us.
Is voice training actually useful for anyone, or are there some cases where the surgery is required to reach the more feminine vocal range? Cuz I've just started and I can't possibly see how my voice will every sound feminine. I can't get higher pitch at all and my voice just cracks or whatever.
I mess around with voice tools, and I think it can be handy too how it can record a bit and you can play it right back, though it basically just does pitch, which is supposed to be pretty irrelevant versus resonance or whatever, only I don’t understand what those other things ARE, nor what to physically do to change them.
Don’t forget all the racial and sexual slurs we get called. That’s including the T-slur. 

And not to mention the ones that are always starting conversations like, “ I’m not racist but-“ or “I’m not homophobic but-“ and it’s like yep imma stop you right there and remove myself from this conversation and do something that doesn’t require conversating with you 😂 

Even had instances where just cuz I’m white, racists, homophobes, transphobes, etc. will start spouting their bigotry and then I have to call em out.
A lot of us are changing this shit in the south and that’s why republicans are freaking out and passing these terrible anti-LGBT laws. They can’t stand that people are getting tired of their hate. It’s desperation. They are flexing hard while they still can.
Well I can't speak for everyone,but I would say I used to have a pretty masculine voice, and much like yourself, I didn't believe that I could reach a feminine range. While I'm sitting fairly low on the fem scale, I am now within the range *almost* naturally by this point. I've even shocked some coworkers lol
YukkoEX (on tiktok is where I saw this) shared a tip that helped me quite a bit. I can't remember exactly what was said, but to adjust resonance you basically want to reduce the space in your throat. They suggested to swallow, and pay attention to the feeling (more or less?) The more ""closed"" your throat is, the higher your resonance will be. This was easily the *hardest* part, because it's quite difficult to figure out how to do this. Even now I run into issues where my voice will legit just cut out while practicing this

Edit: found the video https://www.tiktok.com/t/ZMYbNqeBn/
Huh, maybe I can do it then. It's just idk how to control my voice. And I still need to get over the embarrassed feeling I get when practicing. It's stupid but I still feel it.
That’s interesting, thanks!

I’m super clueless with this, and obnoxiously I feel like even to the extent I feel I sound better or worse, it’s not consistent. 

Like I just tried to do what you described while running VoiceTools, so I could listen back to it, and then did it without doing that, and like I actually… I don’t know that it’s anywhere near perfect but it’s not Vin Diesel sounding to me, but then, especially when I’m talking to my mom I hate how it sounds most of the time… Although you with that, I guess not all the time.

I don’t know, I wish I could’ve just avoided the damage that was done to me, I hate this. 

Right this very moment  I feel like I don’t sound very bad, but I don’t know what I’m doing and it may slip away at any moment, and I don’t even trust that it’s decent without being able to hear it back immediately. 

I really wish there was an app that would tell you what your residence was you could adjust and practice! 

At this point, I can’t even tell how masculine and sound even when I’m specifically trying. Like I know, is I dictate this it’s above the androgynous range in Voice Tools, that’s without even necessarily matters, I don’t think it’s the worst thing ever, but… Honestly, I think if I sounded like this all the time, but I looked pretty I would be fine, because there’s cis women who could pass for male from their voice, but then you SEE them
I have faith in you! There is definitely a learning curve, I won't deny that. But once you know how to control your resonance, it should move along petty quickly
Do you have any advice on how I can even begin?
I'm no professional, and as soon as I learned how to control resonance I kinda went off the road and did my own thing. That being said, I hear trans voice lessons on YouTube is a good place to learn, a lot of people seem to reccomend it"	129derh	trans	586	0.98	2023-04-02 07:13:21
(Almost 7 months on hrt!) Things have been going good, I don’t really ever get misgendered anymore. Not sure if I actually pass or people are just being nice though 😅		"You pass easy! I love your hair too btw! <3
Definitely pass!
You pass as fuck, I'd have no idea if it wasn't in the title
I'd definitely say you pass! Also your hair looks great!

I think you pass! I think your hair is really pretty too :)
you definitely pass AND you’re super cool and possess much gender
How do you do your hair? Is that just your normal curls with the bangs straightened?
You're doing great, happy for you
You pass faster than light.
Girl wtf you so pass.

The pain of being misgendered isn’t restricted to trans people. I’m sorry this has happened to her, and I hope others can draw parallels to our community.		"Yet it's mostly a trans issue though. Bc cis people don't have to go through the bullshit of proving themselves constantly against a world that fucking hates them for existing, which is the case with trans people.
Yeah, my brother is 6' tall and has long hair. He has been called ma'am before
Honestly a tiny bit refreshing. Like, nobody should have to deal with it, of course, but the fact that a cis person would be able to understand it in a very similar way is interesting.
Transphobes trying so hard to transphobe that they transphobia the cis
This is quite common amongst cis GNC people especially cis butch lesbians. Can be anything from an innocent mistake to a targeted jerk move.
...So this isn't a cis thing at all to actually loving being called the opposite gender all the time ? Wait so I'm maybe not a faker ?
So yeah this also shows how people can essentially be gaslit about their own identity through misgendering EVEN IF they havent questioned it
My brother and I have always been mistaken for each other by relatives and it made him very self conscious :(

And he's had people at stores try to sell him dresses and stuff, which is kind of funny, but I think it really bothers him
I'm tempted to comment on her post, ""Now imagine being treated that way every single day and even if you try to correct them, many will still AGGRESSIVELY disregard what you say and continue to misgender you"" haha
I am le dumb.  My brain randomly selects whatever word it can reach that vaguely matches the meaning we are looking for.  Sometimes, I don't remember the masculine form of ma'am quick enough and refer to a full grown bearded hulk of a man as ""miss"".  It's awkward for everyone involved.
My father is 6'7 with a giant beard & long hair down to his waist. When he used to drive taxis, he'd always get referred to as a woman by people when they got in the backseat. Then he'd turn around & make a joke or play up to it to see if they'd laugh at themselves, apologise or get uncomfortable. He thought it was the funniest thing ever.

The first time I got gendered correctly he was there & he just laughed and was like *""now we've both been [misgendered, he didn't know the word] that's so funny isn't it??? Haha highlight of the day! Hey, there's your aunt - stand off to the side and see if she thinks you're a boy too, that'd be so hilarious""* and my closeted ass died.
I know a trans woman who was a volunteer at the Olympics here in 2012 looking after the athletes.

She spoke to the male gymnasts (who are typically in the 5' range) and the female rowers (approx 6') and they both said that they get misgendered because of their height. It must be some sort of instinctive thing that people associate tallness with certain genders despite all things to the contrary.

I'm 6' and when getting some breakfast at work yesterday I was greeted by the male server as 'darling' (😁😁😁) but then I got called 'sir, oops sorry, ma'am' when he handed me my food. It could have been my voice, could have been my height, could have been the transparent covid screens distorting my D-cup breasts...
But at least some of them know what it feels like. That's important for helping them understand our experience
Hey, big fan of your dad!
Omggggg, I worship ur dad like, all the time. Could you put in a good word for me 🥺
I live with someone that does it so that's unironically very true 💀
My first thought exactly lol
you're onto something there...
Please don’t, that’s not the take away here.
I think the difference is that when you are cis and misgendered, almost 100% of the time at least in America, you can correct the person and say like ""Actually I'm a woman"" and they'll apologize and probably feel really embarrassed and never to it again. For example this happened to my sister once as a little kid; a guy at the grocery store called her a boy and she loudly yelled ""I'm a GIRL"" and the guy apologized to my mom for like 5 minutes straight. 

Versus when I was misgendered as a trans person and I said, ""Actually I use he/him, I'm a man,"" people will say shit like ""I don't have to go out of my way to accommodate your delusional mental illness."" 

There's a huge difference. It's like saying that men understand how women feel when they are catcalled because he was hit on by a gay guy one time.

This is clear in the original post that's linked: the young cis woman saying she feels bad after being called sir gets endless universal support from the online community, being called beautiful, strong, etc. But if a trans woman were to post that she'd get endless comments saying ""well you're a man"" or ""you'll never be a woman"" or ""people don't have to call you what you want to be called if they don't agree with it.""
I'm also a fan! Wassup hellboy fan club?! 🤘😅
He told me to tell you that you are allowed to claim your space, that your boundaries are valid and that he's proud of you, no matter what.
I get everything you're saying. But, I'd argue, it's basically the exact same thing (at the core of the issue, not the way bigots treat us vs cis people). We're every bit as much whichever gender we identify with as they are and it SHOULD be seen as just as much of an embarrassment to misgender us as it is to misgender a cis person, because the so-called differences between us and them are illusory. And if more cis people can understand even a slice of what it feels like to be flagrantly gaslit everyday, then maybe some change will happen. That's a world I hope we live in sometime soon
Your dad stopped answering my calls, can you find out if he's lost service in the soul pit again???

How do I help my bullied co-worker?	"I (26 have a relatively new co-worker who is a pre-op trans woman. She is constantly misgendered, deadnamed, made fun of and excluded by our male co-workers. 

I have started sitting with her at lunch, because she‘s a fun person to be around and I don’t like how the others are treating her. I defend her against the guys when they are harassing her and they leave her alone afterwards, but they do it when I‘m not around now. I have talked to the guys, tried to make them understand her or at least leave her alone. They say they‘ll leave her alone and do it behind my back.

I‘m honestly worried for her mental health, since she has confided in me that she has depression and has to wait 18 months for HRT.

Is there anything I can do to help her?

Update: 
My friend and I have contacted the Betriebsrat (workers council). I have made a copy of the journal evidence, as advised. If our employer doesn’t fire them, the Betriebsrat will involve the Arbeitsgericht (labor court). My friend can also refuse to do her work until the problem is solved, without fearing that she‘ll lose her job or salary. 

I have also scheduled a meet-up once a week with her. We’ll go shopping on Saturday after work and go to a spa next weekend with my (hopefully soon our) female friends. I will introduce her to my other friends soon, I don’t want to overwhelm her.

Thanks everyone for the advice, I believe that everything is going to be okay."	"Homie they need to be reported to HR this isn't the playground anymore. Companies can end up in alot of legal issues if the work environment is transphobic. This is also the adult world and you coworker could start recording all the interactions with those men and go after them in court for harassment and discrimination
I feel so useless to help her. I wish I could just stay by her side all day so they leave her alone. She‘s started self-harming and has a history of suicidal ideation. I don’t want her to die…
There's alot you can do report them to HR is the main thing but continuity of friendship is another but ask her if there's anything specific that she's wanting you or anyone to do
Idk how she is with touch and stuff, but if you haven't already you really should give her a hug now and then, at least. That small bit of human connection really can go a long way. People tend to underestimate how healing touch can be.

Also, I'd think that looking for a new job wouldn't be the worst idea for her. You might want to bring that up if talking to HR doesn't work. And please do talk to HR.

Additionally, thank you for being such a great person to her.
Report them to HR. Being a friend is awesome and thank you for being a friend! But report them. Make notes on instances and be specific. Bullies certainly escalate over time and it should be stopped now. Stay in the legal lines of your area,video isn't always legal  But a clear and concise written statement should get someone's attention
You’re a great friend, you’re doing great so far. Sounds like you’re already her rock, she’ll build her own confidence over time and one day she’ll be sticking up for you when others are getting you down x
Please report them because that is harassment.
Keep being her friend. It helps to know someone else cares.
On top of all the other good advice here, I just want to point out that being her friend in a time of need is also immensely helpful 😊
I think at the more socially acceptable end of the spectrum you can speak up. You can just say ""hey man, that's fucked up.""

At the more extreme end of things you can, like, wreck their shit and get them fired.
I have a direct report that was sexually harassed, she mentioned it to me ""as a friend"" one day (we were coworkers/friends before I became her manager) and said she just wanted me to know. 

She then told me about a previous incident from the same guy that she didn't tell me about when it happened and again reiterated she just wanted to tell me and not report it to HR.

I regret not reporting the incidents. I failed her as a friend and as a manager. If you are in a major corporation with an HR department then I would absolutely report the incident(s) you've witnessed.

In my case the guy left shortly after she told me. But he should have been fired.
Since others gave you good advice on what to do with the bullies… as far as your coworker… is she working with a trans-affirming therapist? Not someone who is just accepting… but someone who is well versed in trans identities? Getting a therapist that I didn’t have to feel like I was constantly educating about my identity was a game changer for my mental health. Made it way easier to actually process through things like jerks taking their insecurities out on me
Yes. Report their asses to HR. Bullying is never alright anywhere at any age at any place.
Apart from reporting this to HR as some have suggested, supporting her and standing up for her when you can is already a huge help, so just keep that up. Lending an ear if she wants to vent about the waiting time for hrt or other things is also something you can do, if you aren't already doing that.
All the advice given already is great and I can't really add more to it. As someone who is in the closet and hiding from the world, I could really use a hug. I can only imagine what she's going through, things like a hug may seem small but could also make a huge impact! And thank you so much for being such a kind person! We need more of you in this world!
U just did
Everybody's different, but when I was in a really bad mental state scheduling fun things at a specific date/time in the near future (eg let's hang out Friday after work) helped me keep going, both because it was something to look forward to, and because I didn't want to disappoint the person I had made plans with. 

Also, if you can, try to introduce her to some other people to try to make her more friends. I often would try to avoid a person that I feel has ""done too much for me"" even if that's both untrue and would leave me lonely, so she would have more options for the future. 

Sorry I don't have any advice for dealing with the bad coworkers though. 

PS: I'm literally crying over how nice you're being to your coworker. She's so lucky to have someone as good as you in such an otherwise bad environment. Hope everything goes well for you both!
I got to HR and make a formal complaint
Oh surg just keep doing what you are doing......
Being trans myself and having been a supervisor for some years, yes, this needs to be escalated to HR asap. 
Also, if they are not taking immediate action, depending on how high your companie's profile is, threatening to make this public can put pressure on HR. They tend to prioritize covering their asses. 

Also, it can be very beneficial to have 1:1 off the record meetings with potential allys in management.
Yeah include her in your stuff and if anyone says anything tell f off
take it to hr right away get a manager or boss u trust to help you. i’ve had a coworker refuse to serve trans customers nd got his ass fired, nobody believed it was a big deal until i lit broke down crying in front of my manager bc of him and she realized she had to do something. it’s always helpful to have someone higher up that really knows what’s going on bc they don’t usually see it. so yeah finding a manager u trust to help u talk to whoever u need to is a game changer.
You're the bestest friend in the world. So glad she has you!
Find her a lawyer.  If your employer is larger than like, 50 employees total, then Title 7's sex discrimination provisions (which are applicable to gender-based discrimination as well) make this unlawful.  If she tells your employer and they don't remedy the situation, she can sue (and can received up to 300k in punitive damages)
First off those men should be fired for discrimination this is an act of violence and hate where I work they do not take discrimination lightly they fire the person that discriminates on just being for who they are (hopefully that did not come weird)
She‘s unfortunately very shy and intimidated and just goes to the bathroom to cry. Never talked back at all. I have been keeping track of the harassment in a journal. 

Can I report this to the HR or does she have to do it? 
I don’t think she will, she just takes the abuse and I worry for her mental health.
This seriously depends on the country and possibly state unfortunately. Also HR doesn’t protect the workers, it protects the company. So treading carefully with them is advisable. But as far as the legal responsibility of the company - and also laws about secretly recording interactions - really depends on the place.
Let her know how much you value her friendship. Maybe ask her to have a regular time to get together outside of work? Any additional positive routine can give her something to look forward to and hold on for.
I‘ll talk to her and ask if I can do anything to help. 
I‘ve actually been keeping track of the harassment in a journal. 

There is also a workers council here, but the decision is up to her. She just never says something back and is intimidated by the others.
Thank you, I‘ll ask her if she wants a hug. I love hugs and my friends also gave me healing hugs when I was depressed and lonely. I hope I can be there for her like my friends were there for me 10 years ago and ever since.
Thank you, I also believe she’ll become more confident with time! I‘ll have her back and I bet she‘ll have mine too.
Agreed. You’re obligated to report harassment if you witness it.
I do know that she‘s in therapy, because she told me that it‘s a requirement to get 18 months of therapy to get HRT approved. I don’t know if it‘s trans-affirming.
I‘ll ask her later.
I wish I could give you the hug you need. Being starved of affection is so awful. Loneliness is like death. *hugs you virtually with consent*
Thanks your your insight! I‘m planning to introduce her to my friends and invited her to our Christmas get-together. I‘ve also asked her to hang out after work and she wants to go shopping and next weekend we’ll go to a spa with my (soon our) lady friends. I‘m so exited!
Unfortunately, we are in Germany and I don’t know about the laws here, but I‘ll look into it, thank you.
Yes if you've witnessed the events yourself you can 100% go to HR.
I will. I have actually visited a park with her last week, which was awesome. I‘ll try to schedule regular get togethers for us. She told me that her friends and family cut contact with her after coming out and she has no one now. I don’t want her to feel lonely.
This is so important. You see depression feeds isolation. Isolation feeds suicide. To be out and socially accepted helps tremendously. PTSD kicks in and amplifies the whole process. Take her to get your nails done. Have a ladies spa day with friends. Take her shopping. Anything you do to include her will help save her life. Community support is unbelievably powerful. You are her guardian angel now. Watch her Bloom as the newly hatched butterfly she is. The metamorphosis will be amazing to see.
That's probably because it's dangerous for alot of us to do so .... I've been threatened with death for speaking up in defense of myself just because I'm trans
You've gotta stand up and be the ally if they can't get the proper people involved themselves. Victims of harassment typically feel weak against their antagonizers so they sometimes don't stand up for themselves or seek help. You've gotta be the voice for them if that's the case
You're such a sweetheart ❤️
That’s it. Just keep it real with her, give her some pointers on things to avoid doing so she doesn’t get made fun of? But be gentle, she’s probably quite sensitive currently, but the other side of tough conversations are usually breakthroughs
Since you said you're in Germany: that's actually not required but some therapists will outright lie about the requirements. Depending on the area she lives in she might be able to get HRT sooner. Maybe tell her to check out r/germantrans for info! 😊
Thanks love! *Receives hug with a big smile*
Does your company have a Betriebsrat? If so, definitely talk to them about the bullying first. They have to help you. If not report it to your HR department or your boss. Trans people are protected by the Allgemeine Gleichbehandlungsgesetz (AGG) in Germany. 

Make sure it's a written report and keep a copy of everything. It's great that you kept a journal and will be important for evidence. 

I'd also recommend for your friend to join a union. They provide legal advice and can pressure your company if they don't stop the bullying.

Here's a link about her rights regarding bullying in general: https://www.betriebsrat.com/mobbing-am-arbeitsplatz
Oh, I didn’t know that! I‘ll report this, thankfully I have the journal. Thank you!
In the LGBTQ+ community, many people have found family in those who are willing to stick with them when their bio family won't. You may be all she has right now. Thank you so much for being there for her. She's lucky to have you around
>She told me that her friends and family cut contact with her after coming out and she has no one now.

Long ago, some idiot completely mutilated a saying to “Blood is thicker than water,” to make it sound like family was more important than friendship.

That’s bullshit, because the FULL saying is “The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,” correctly saying that those bonds we make by choice are stronger than that of mere blood relation.

Thank you for letting her know she’s loved and valued.
Dear God, I‘m so sorry you have been threatened. 
I‘ve also been threatened before, by my aunt, for wearing jeans and a t-shirt from the mens section and cutting my hair short. 
I‘m bisexual (not out to fam) and she said that if I was gay or trans she‘ll honor kill me. People are insane!
Yeah, I have been yelling at the guys and they listen for a while, they get to her when I‘m not around. I‘m so angry at these people. Honestly, I wish I could just throw hands, these bastards are awful.
The stuff she get made fun of for is speaking in a high voice, wearing feminine clothes, painting her nails and her long hair. She didn’t do anything weird that I would need to tell her. She just exists. Quiet, does her work excellently.
Oh, I didn’t know that! Thanks!
We do have a Betriebsrat and are both apart of a union. Thanks for the link and information!
Please also tell your friend first. It could make her feel confronted even if it's in her interest.
That journal make a copy before you turn it over. Always keep a backup copy. That journal is evidence. HR can turn on you and deny receiving it. HR has the company interest not for the employees interest. Each company is different. A Christian based company can do anything and say that it's against their beliefs. I would push this whole issue as a toxic work place rather that sexual harassment. Just be careful and realize who you work for. HR may know and want her gone. I went through shit like this. I finally got a position at the right place. My life soared after that.
Please do and if it's not too much trouble keep us updated. I love workplace tea
Yeah, I‘m also LGBTQ+ (bi) and I have also had to find my chosen family. I hope she can be a part of it.

Do you think it‘s okay to invite her for the holidays? My friends and I get together, since we can‘t celebrate with our bio family and she can’t either.
That‘s my experience too. My family of origin is awful, but I have created a chosen family with my friends. We‘re like a coven or a pack.
They absolutely are  and I'm sorry you're family is awful
It might be time to be her voice and bring it to the ears it needs to reach. We loose to many brothers and sisters every year to their own hands because of things like this.
So basically people are taking the piss out of her for being herself? That’s hilarious because you’ll find if she is truly being herself it won’t bother her after a while and she’ll start defending herself a bit more. This is her starting to love herself again. Keep doing what you do and watch her blossom 🥀🌹🌺
That's great! Definitely talk to the Betriebsrat and your union then. Best of luck 🤞
Of course, I‘ll tell her.
Oh shit, thanks for the warning!
Will do. Thanks for the kind advice, I‘m not overstepping by posting in this sub, since I‘m not trans myself.
You absolutely can and should invite her for the holidays. No question about that. In fact you should be politely insistent about it. They should not be alone for the holidays. <3
Yeah, I‘ll be her voice. I want to be her friend, she‘s a total sweetheart. I just don’t understand how people can be so cruel.
I'm not trans either. Just an ally who's here to learn so I can support friends and family
Thanks for the feedback, I will invite her <3
It's a lack of empathy. It's all too common here in Texas
This makes me really happy to see :) I hope she accepts your invitation

i came out last night	"last night i came out to my mom as ftm. she hugged me and said, ""it's ok son, i love you."" T\^T im so thankful- i thought she wasn't gonna take it well ngl. she started using my preferred name and pronouns immediately. :)

edit: she took me out to dinner and i was upset the whole bc of cramps and she was scared that it was bc she kept accidentally misgendering me T\^T  i had to tell her like 3 times it was ok bc she was still trying 

edit2: its a year later and she gave up. i was talking to my sister one night about how happy i was to be accepted and i asked if my mom and dad ever slipped up and she kindly let me know that they often misgender and deadname me. they tell all my siblings im faking it for attention and that they also should disrespect me behind my back. they've slowly stopped trying to use my pronouns and name over the months. ive lost all of the little respect i had gained from her pretending to respect me. my dad has resorted to calling me his kid/child instead of son/daughter and they/them instead of he or her. on my 1 year anniversary of being out all my mom said when i told was ""ok...? u act like i should care or smth"" then got upset hadn't done my chores yet. i genuinely thought it was going good but whatever, im most likely gonna cut contact with them when i move out next year, the feeling of being respected as a human being felt good while it lasted"	"Are you winning son?
That's so nice of her, give her a big hug and never let go.
I'm gonna cry 🥺❤️
I'm very proud of you (and your mom)! YAY :D

Damn she immediatly went for it! Didnt even hesitate to call you son!
Congratulations little guy! You and your mother are an awesome example of what a parent/child relationship should be! All the best to you both.
You got this dude.
i wish my parents called me their daughter.
Damn, it’s been a year and my parents keep saying that it’s just so hard to use my pronouns. I know you don’t care enough to make change, shut up and get practicing dad, because your the one who’s gonna be sad when I leave for collage and never fucking call you until you get it right.

Sorry for ranting, congrats on coming out. I’m glad it went well
HE’S WINNING!! 😭💜🙌🌈
im so sorry about that dude :( hopefully he comes to his senses soon T\~T

I found the best counter argument for people who misgender me	"Disclaimer: I mean for only people who misgender you intensionally to annoy you.

Actually a friend told me that, if some cis person misgenders you, just misgender them back. It's small and it's not like your are shouting or cursing them. It's more to get them annoyed and make them feel what you feel.

Shouting etc often just make them feel better for hurting you and doesn't really do anything for them, by misgendering them you just make them feel uncomfortable in the perfect level, and they can't really complain to anyone :)

Also note: My language (Hebrew) has pronounces baked to every. single. word. which is shit but makes this tactic more interesting"	"Yes, but only for people that do it intensional
This is a cool method to use when people at family gatherings or in friend groups and such intentionally misgender you.

Though I also agree that you should be careful to use that method on just anyone, especially strangers who you don't know so well. It is simply a point of your safety, as there are people who have such terrible character that they would attack you for simply calling them out.
Feel free to do what makes you feel comfortable, but I find just telling the person, “I go by she/her (in my case) pronouns.”, usually does the trick for me. 

If they continue, I ask “please use she/her pronouns when referring to me.”, and like 99% of the time, by this point in the conversation, the person starts using the right pronouns/gender. 

And if not, I take solace in knowing that they look like a totally inconsiderate jerk, and I held my composure.
Personally if someone intentionally misgenders me (especially someone I know), I will just remove myself from the situation and fully ignore every advance they might have to try and talk to me.

Being ignored is hurtful and to some extent you could almost say I treat them like humans do with pets, if they educate them: If they do something wrong, like playfully biting them too hard, you just ignore them, so they realize this is ""a bad thing"". If that doesn't help, then they are usually a lost cause anyways.
I think pronoun aren't as important to cis people as they are to us

I was taking with a cis AFAB the other day about this,  and she said what's the big deal is. 

And I asked her what if everyone called you he/ him,  she said,  'I would laugh, it doesn't bother me, by my name,  everyone thinks I'm a boy anyway.""
Honestly, how do you tell if someone is misgendering you because of malice or because they made an honest mistake? I can never tell so I never get mad.
I'm bad at hebrew, so whenever I am about to speak it to people I warn them that I'm not intentionally trying to misgender them I'm just bad at the language
Challenge mode: the transphobe is a deeply repressed trans person and kinda likes it
actually thought of doing that to the right winged trolls that think trans people are faking it, give them a taste of their own medicine. Butttttt then inner me says, ""Don't stoop to their level, Chloe. It may just give trans people a bad name, and it'd give them more fuel for the trans hate fire.""
As a cis person, I kept thinking how would I react if anyone misgender my mtf wife to hurt her.
I kinda decided to also misgender back. But unlike you, I know I'll be shouting and be the biggest bitch possibly xD
I am way over protective over my wife and the trans community 💖😅
I don’t like misgendering them because I know how much it hurts, I usually use names that are just a bit off of theirs. Like calling Michael, Mike or Misha or Michel. Just enough to confuse them without reading hurting them. If they don’t catch on I get more obvious and use more and more ridiculous names
Yeah of course that's what I meant, thought it was clear :)
Just wanted to add to this: if you meet a random person at the street and they misgender you telling them ""I am a _"" sounds unnatural and you dont know if that person is transphobic. Insted just stare at them like they are obviously wrong, go ""yeah ok"", and keep talking or say something like ""wow I knew I had baby face but I didnt know it was that bad"" (this one is for transmascs and the one I use, if you have other ideas share them). In that case that person starts using the correct pronouns without you putting ypurself at risk.
Of course that's what I do too, I meant for people who do it intentionally to annoy you
I would go with frequency. If you see them multiple times a week, and they consistently misgender, or don't seem to be making an effort, then I'd be mad.  But if it's like 1 out of every 5 interactions, just a mistake.
Depends on if they know you're trans or not imo. And how long they've known if they do know. Like if you came out to them a week ago, chances are they'll slip up and its an accident.  If they've known for a very long time its probably malicious. Especially if you remind them of ur pronouns and they CONSTANTLY get it wrong even directly after being reminded and they never apologize.
Thankfully I haven’t run into many people like that, but just be careful. 

I imagine there’s strong overlap between the group of people who would intentionally misgender you to annoy you, & the group of people who are prone to violent fits of anger when they get called out.

Know what I mean?
For me, I usually find the issue way more online, than in person. When people go out of their way to use words like, ""he, him, brother, son"", etc, then I usually go with ""she, her, sister, girlfriend, etc"". And by the second or 3rd time are like, ""Why do you keep using those words""? And I point out they assumed my gender, and kindly ask them to be more mindful."	mnbhfp	trans	560	0.99	2021-04-09 06:48:55
Had to be checked before I start working and I am fucking broken rn	"Hi 🎂
I just have to vent about it and here is a good place. 
I had to do my pre-work checks (if I am able to work and shit) so I went to the clinic that does all that. 
I will say that cause I guess it is kinda important - it's all in Poland. 
So I still have my dead name and a wrong gender on my ID, right? But my looks are not THAT masculine at this point (I can't be love I am saying that with all the dysphoria I am experiencing). I go in, looking like a fucking princess and like, you know, I start registering. The lady there was nice to me. She reason the card, where I specified I am on HRT and stuff and she goes ""oh sure, every pretty lady can fill this paper"", and gave me the paper. That was heart warming. But everything that happens after, isn't. So I gave her my ID, and the longer she was looking at it and writing down informations, I felt more and more bad. At the end, when I got registered and received all the papers about where do I go and stuff, I start sobbing cause I see all the informations I don't want there to be. Even more I had to fill a card about my health and in Poland you have to fucking cross words on the card that do not match YOUR GENDER, which made me even more sad. 
First doc didn't even stutter to misgender and deadname me. I just say on the fucking chair and literally cried while he was checking me. 
Went out, and went to another doc. She just looked at, at the paper, and with a cold stare in the eyes said ""so is everything okay MISTER"". I was at the fucking edge. I started crying even more. I just went out without a word, taking my papers. The whole one hour walk home I  couldn't stop crying, and even today I am still a fucking mess and can't get this out of me. 
It's not for me. 
The only thing I can think about is just ""I'm so sad I was born like that"". 
W/e. I just had to write it down somewhere and get this shit out of me cause why not. 
I hope you will have a good day at least. My transgender week did not start well. 
🎂🧡🐼"	"Dang sis.. i really hope things'll get better for ya soon and im only a  dum 17 yr old but if ya need to talk to someone i can be here for ya. :<
I am incredibly sorry for this, and I know a strangers comment on reddit probably will not help that much but girl, we are here all for you. Everyone has had experiences like this, some worse and some not that bad but we all understand the struggle and we all support each other. Thank you for sharing even if it was hard to remember the details, but for me it shows inmense strenght and bravery to share experiences such as this one. Don't ever give up Queen <3
Oh fuck that. 

You deserve better, and those stupid fucking doctors will get their karma.
I'm so sorry you had to go through that. Not fun. But you've got this girl!
Poland is SO backwards about this stuff.  And the government is pushing all the time to make it MORE backwards.

I'm so sorry this is happening to you.
I'm so sorry for that!! You deserve respect, being examined while crying is absolutely NOT OK. Doctors should be more human and empathetic. Sending virtual hugs your way <3
That is no way for professionals to treat a beautiful lady like HoeMia.  They should be ashamed, not you.
All the hugs!
This is the path we must take till we finish our dream.  There are haters and jealous people out there that live to hurt others.  Hang in there and be the proudest and best you can be.  We are your sisters and have cried the tears with you.  Don’t let them make you cry.  Your pillow is for that.  I transitioned in a security setting, dominated by males, and now a blonde girl gives 70 of them orders.   Huggs and be Beautiful.
Girl I feel you 
The place that gets me my hrt deadnames me every time it’s unbelievable.

I really hope your female week goes girly from now on.
And if you ever need to talk (or a place to run away to) I’m here to listen (and about three hours away from Poland)
I don’t even know what to say.

I hope things get better for you.
My heart goes out to you. Every doctor around the world who utters the creed should know first to do no harm and it harms literally nobody to respect one's gender and to recognise they are a valid person no matter what or how convicted they are of their identity. Any doctor who behaves otherwise and fails to treat a person as a person ought not to practice.
That sounds horrible. I can barely handle being misgendered too much, so I can't imagine how that felt. Im so sorry about that
Oh no, I'm so sorry that happened hon. People can really suck sometimes, I'm sorry. If you need to talk to someone, my inbox is open. We're all rooting for you girl!
They tried to take your dignity and they failed. Stay strong.  You know the truth.  You are a beautiful, fucking woman!
Show them my links below. I'm proud, not shy, gay, embarrassed, ashamed, afraid -  no regrets of becoming Trans Woman. Post-op since 2018. There are many more people in this world who have changed their indentity and are happier as a result. I accept feedback from critics. Going back to work, next week, as a Licensed Sheet Metal Worker alongside other men. I haven't had any issues, at least not a big deal to resolve. Stand up and be strong. It's a challenging journey. There's some unpleasant surprises ahead but just face it head on. I live in Kitchener Ontario Canada 🇨🇦

Those are just horrible human beings

Reading this I just wanted to go psycho and threaten the 2 assholes who misgendered you... I hate this
I am so sorry you had to experience. Although the world is changing, it changes slowly, and there will always be people so consumed by their own hatred and ignorance they will never be able to free themselves. Please think about that. You are freing yourself to be who you know they are. They will probably be trapped in the vile cesspool of their own minds forever. Listen, I know this doesn't help how you feel now, but do not let anyone defeat you. This is YOUR LIFE! It is up to you fight for yourself. I find it helps me when I look at people who try to harm me (over anything) and instead of anger I feel pity for them. It is empowering and liberating. Good luck. :)
Stuff like this infuriates me. They knew exactly what they were doing and how they were hurting you intentionally. Don’t worry about those scum bags they’ll get theirs
Ohh ✨ thank u sm 🧡 I'll remember that for sure 🐼
Thank you for the support 🙈✨
Yes, Poland does not at all seem like a safe place for trans folx. OP, I would seek asylum somewhere else in the EU if you can.

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT_rights_in_Poland
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LGBT-free_zone
Reminds me of the quote:
“Sometimes people use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like a person’ and sometimes they use ‘respect’ to mean ‘treating someone like an authority’
“And sometimes people who are used to being treated like an authority say ‘if you don’t respect me, I won’t respect you’ and they mean ‘if you don’t treat me like an authority I won’t treat you like a person’
“And they think they’re being fair but they’re not and that’s not ok”
From someone on Tumblr
Ur welcome pleaae have a very good day ☺
Poland is an EU country, anyone in Poland can move to any other EU country - no asylum necessary.

The issue is it's expensive to move, it's hard to find meaningful work, you have to leave your family behind, you have to learn a new language etc.

Moving isn't an option for everyone sadly - even if legally allowed at any time and like moving from Alabama to New York as far as legality.

I still get misgendered daily by friends, family, and co workers, but lately it hasn't been getting me down as much cause for the first time in my life I'm finally starting to appreciate my own body!		"At this point you should start carrying the phone numbers or opticians and ophthalmologists, because if they're misgendering you, there's something wrong with their eyes and they need that checked out.

You look great! I love your curls!
You look stunning!❤️
you are super ultra mega beautiful hello.
beautiful!
Your friends, family and friends must be blind idiots. 

I think you are are totally stunning.   
The tats might be an issue, som maybe some longer sleeved shirts might be a solution, but really. you are just head-banging lovely!!!

Hang in there Ivy. And to all those who hurt you on purpose: FUCK 'EM!!!
Well you look fantastic any which way.  Just be yourself and own your life girl!
you're beautiful!
I dont... How does anyone missgender you? My brain thought this was a post from womens fitness sub, but no its just some lady being happy.
I’m sorry but can I ask how do you tuck? Or do you ise any kind of gaff?
You have like the same body type as me, and you look sooooo good. There is hope for me yet >:3
Yeah I was about to say... _You_ get misgendered, OP? What!? Can they _not_ see how amazing you look? ✨
🥰 y'all are too sweet! All these comments made my day! I love this community!
Yeah I have tucking panties from Leolines on Etsy. They're a bit pricey but totally worth it! I just wear them over my normal panties and I don't even have to tuck, they just make everything disappear.

I know tomboyx also sells tucking panties for even cheaper, but I haven't tried them yet, but they look quite similar to my Leolines.
Thank you!! Been looking for some good gaffs!

Is it okay or not?	"I'm a trans guy, but I don't feel uncomfortable (not very much) being deadnamed and misgendered
I live in a place where no one will ever call you by your preferred name. Is it okay to not care about it or it's not? Sorry, just wanted to know"	"Of course it’s okay, as long as you’re okay with it
I don’t get dysphoria around pronouns. I’m not a huge fan of my deadname but as long as people are using it deliberately to hurt me I don’t mind. You’re valid, my guy.
I'm FtNB on T with no plans to change my name, and I don't care what pronouns people use. How other people see me is irrelevant; I only care how I see myself
to be honest, i felt the same way before and even now after i’ve transitioned. to me, i cringe when people i know or used to know call me by a new name and would prefer that they call me by my birth name and for new individuals, it varies. but either way i don’t really care and yes you are still valid. 

there’s no right or wrong way to be trans nor are there specific instructions that tell you what you should or shouldn’t be dysphoric about, just rmbr that
Different people have different experiences. Different things give different people dysphoria or euphoria. Your experiences are not more or less valid than anyone else's.
It's totally okay! You don't need to be unhappy with things to be trans.
I’m in the same situation myself. I don’t get mad at people for misgendering because me personally I don’t agree with that. People make mistakes and a kind none snappy reminder is all I feel people need. 

But I live in a small conservative town and almost no one will as you said. So it’s best for me to just go about my day with a smile. It doesn’t bother me in the slightest.
Sure fine by me
Hey, it’s okay. But in my experience, I personally didn’t mind it at first, but then when I got a “taste” of being called Emerald for a while, I wanted people to only call me Emerald.
Against what seems to be common believe in some of the trans subs a lot of the time it is in fact not mandatory to completely split of your old live in order to be trans. If you have lived your live so far as your non-preferred gender and are able to accept it as a part of you (being basically responsible that you are the way you are now) it is also totally fine to not be offended by it. It is not a requirement to throw away all your past experiences just because you are finally able to be your self. Since the happy moments and experiences you made in the past were still real. As such … do what feels right for you. I feel like there is no need for any gatekeeping :)
i very much prefer my new pronouns and new name, but i can't say i hate being called my old pronouns and deadname. i dislike it but it isn't a painful thing to endure, just uncomfortable
I'm transmasc but I don't mind my deadname or she/her pronouns. Maybe it's because  I haven't come out at all and I'm just used to it. Maybe it's because I'm GNC and genderfluid (granted only fem+masc/androgyne genders when fem leaning). Maybe it's because I have dpdr and struggle to connect with my body in general and overall understand my gender. Regardless,  it's okay for any reason. Your gender is your own, and gender and how you present it are two separate things.
There's no rules to being trans my dude. Literally. None. Just don't be a dick and don't cause harm.
Completly valid everyone's experiece of dysphoria is different.
The only thing that matters is your comfort level and how YOU choose to live and handle these type of situations. Build a good support system and you will  be fine!❤
it's okay to not be uncomfortable with it. I haven't been in your position for a while, but when I didn't let people know I found it easier to cope with being deadnamed/misgendered, and maybe it's similar. there's no shame or invalidness in not minding tour deadname/being misgendered. I didn't come out at my workplace for 3 years after I realized myself and while it kinda sucked to be deadnamed/misgendered constantly I knew what to expect and I knew it wasn't malicious. maybe you kind-of cope similarly to how I used to?
Of course its okay! im in the same boat im FtNb and i dont really care if people use my Name i was born with and Pronouns. (Not saying deadname cause im not planning on changing it and dont care if people use it)
I'm a trans guy as well and don't mind my old name. I still don't want to be called by it, but it's the name I went by for 18 years, and my new name for 5.
Its not like you are taking part un this if you told people this is qn okay way to treat trans ppl in genral thats a different story but you dont have to correct everyone.
?
Obviously you don’t have the choice but you think you have it. That’s maybe the reason why you “don’t care”, the most important is to be safe and sound 
If you don’t think it’s a safe place it will never illegitimate you 
Take care, It’s hugely okey 💙
Do you have gender euphoria? You're also scared of being invalid. Are you afraid of being called invalid or just the simple thought of being invalid? If the latter I'd absolutely say you're valid. If the former, I feel that's something more gray and you need to figure it out. Though if you get gender euphoria you're also valid no matter the second two questions. 

I say this because I have a friend who is trying to deal de transition rn, which has been painful for him. For the longest time he was afraid of being invalid and all of that because of the same reasons, and I blindly supported them, which caused a lot more harm than good, and one of the key turning points was when he realized he was only afraid of de transitioning because of what other people would think, not anything internally. 

Wish I had said what I just said to you, to him instead of what I did say. It's fine if figuring it out takes time, and its valid to realize it isnt you and de transition. But its also equally valid to not have gender dysphoria but have other signs you're trans. So yes it's okay no matter what, and who you are will always be valid.
It's okay, still valid! I don't mind being called variations of my deadname sometimes. It's something that differs from trans people.
I'm MtF and out just to few people which leads to the situation I'm misgendered all the time and dead named all the time and I'm not passing. I don't have an issue with that since I don't have strong social dysphoria.
Well, if you don't wanna ""fight"" for the new self, it's okay, just 'cause i bet your friends respect the new name and stuff, so, the people that you care, care about you, it's good.
Honestly sounds like youre lucky. I dont care much either and i count it among my blessings with how frequently i get deadnamed
to be honest its to each their own  


if im out to them and they know my pronouns and name and they use dead name and missgender i cringe a small bit or side eye them   


but if im not out to them i just dont say much as i hate to confront others
Seems like you are quite insecure about fitting in, most of us are I think, me included. But if you are ok with it then it's fine, you are still you and just as valid as anyone else.
It’s ok, you’re still valid and still you
Honestly, only difference here is I'm MtF. But I also really like my original name(I guess I wouldn't call it a dead name because I haven't come out to most people). 

A sorta related story, when I was about 6 I took a swimming class and people misheard my original name, Ethan, for Nathan, and for almost every class everyone called me Nathan because I just thought it would be kinda rude to correct them or something. When I did finally get around to the ""Oh btw, about that name thing"" they were all extremely apologetic, and I didn't really get why because it just didn't matter much to me.  So I've just always been the type to shrug off people calling me the wrong name: I have a different thought process to other people or something, idk.
I don't mind too much when it happens to me either. You're valid! :)
It doesn't bother me that much either but if people want me to respond I typically only respond to the proper pronouns so it's up to them if they want me to respond to them otherwise I will probably assume they are talking to someone else if people are doing it to be disrespectful usually it's obvious and I stop interacting with that person immediately
If that’s what you’re okay with, then yeah. It’s fine.
Don't let other people dictate what you are okay with. If you are okay with something it is okay.
It's your choice in if it's okay or not, if you're okay with it, then that's fine. It sucks that you live in a place that isn't accepting, but I mean, it sounds like you're making the best of it.
it's perfectly fine. A lot of people don't seem to get that there are different types of dysphoria, and you don't need to experience all of them to be transgender. Social dysphoria and physical dysphoria are entirely different, and if you know in your heart that you're more comfortable living as a male, then no one should stop you.
I used to think that it didn’t bother me because my parents and people in school did it all the time (i was only out to a few people), but after a few years it got to a point where it was too much to keep in and it started irritating me more and more the more I started embracing/living as my true gender. Dk if it’s the same but thought I’d share
I will also stand up and gesture to myself
If it bothers you, then it's probably not okay, but if its something that you don't really care about then its okay
That you’re lucky enough to not have an issue with something that some other people in a similar situation do is fine. As long as you genuinely are okay and you’re not just ignoring/suppressing stuff. 

Think of it this way. A kid gets bullied at school, being made fun of and called names, that sort of thing. That the kid has a way of dealing with or ignoring the bullying instead of being upset by it doesn’t mean there’s something wrong with them. 

While there are things that are common for trans people, apart from actually *being* trans there isn’t anything that’s required. Again, as long as you’re really okay with it, then good luck to you; you’ve got more bandwidth available for any other issues you might have to deal with.
As a community we place way to much emphasis on being ""properly gendered"" by strangers.  We let strangers who mis gender us ruin our days. Why?  Why let someone who you may never see again upset you so much. When that happens you give power over you to them. . So stop it.

The problem is simply that we doubt ourselves. We don't think we have the self-confidence to pull this off. Let me tell each and every one of you that you do have that self-confidence. We just have trouble accepting it and the day you realize you have that self-confidence and embrace it  is the day all of the doors open to you. That will be the day when you walk into a room and you realize that you own that room.

Remember. We are our own worst enemy. You've already done the hard part so establish your Kingdom or Queendom. You are the ALPHA.
I took me a really long time to come to terms with who I am so by the time that I was in my 30s a lot of this stuff was so familiar to me that I caught myself doing stupid misgendered things like saying come on man or whatever.

I'm also having a really hard time moving away from my name even though I don't like it and never have, again this is more of a thing of habit than an actual desire to change it or keep it the same. I think ultimately I'm just going to pick a very one-to-one version of my name in a more feminine form, it has a very easy switch to either change a letter or add one to make it distinctly feminine without changing the base sound.

There's also a ton of stuff that's inherently masculine gendered even when it doesn't need to be, so it's hard to parse out and change stuff especially if you're a bit older.
I just don't know if I'm still valid after this
Thanks
I really appreciate it
I am only a few weeks into coming out, and this has been my response to my wonderful friends and family who have asked. It's not about other people and what they see, think, feel, or say. It's about me and what makes me feel happy. Don't get me wrong, when my father calls me ""the hostess with the mostess"", or a friend calls me ""girlfriend"", or ""bad bitch"" or whatever, i immediately glow up. I do get the inner smile from validation, but if someone he/hims me, i still do a pirouette inside and go about my day.
Thanks
I dont  feel like a girl, the womans body is not mine but i dont feel really uncomfortable while being deadnamed
Yes you are 🥰
your being trans isn’t defined by your pain, it’s defined by you not identifying with your birth sex. you’re fine
I don’t mean to come off as harsh, but you shouldn’t be looking to others for validation. You are the only person with any authority over the validity of your identity.
Thanks. And sorry
Seconded
They are literally asking if not requiring external validation is ok, because they are feeling fine without it  

Even out of context, I don't even get your point of view. Positive and validating spaces like this are good for people, you don't need to teach any trans person to be strong. They already are. 

Wanting external validation is a normal human desire and trying to shut off that desire without a lot of radical self-acceptance isn't exactly healthy. You were probably suggesting not shutting it off, but coming to terms with negativity and feeling secure in yourself... that is a loooooong process and your comment isn't gonna do it.

Essentially, don't gatekeep feelings or positivity. Trans spaces are positive and validating to counteract the shit in the world.
There’s nothing to be sorry for 💜🖤 we’re a community, it’s okay to ask for support/have questions
[deleted]
The way I interpreted it, they were asking if they were valid, and I told them that only they had the authority to decide that. I disagree with you saying that trans people are inherently strong. Sure, some trans people are, but a lot of us are just your average person trying to get through. It’s not a bad thing to feel vulnerable, hopeless, weak, etc., it just means that we need support from time to time. This is what we find in online trans communities. I understand the desire for external validation and agree that it’s normal, but I feel like it’s something we should try to move past. We spend too much time trying to conform and often fall into this trap where we become dependent on it. Of course my comment won’t suddenly beam a wave of self-acceptance into their brain, I simply meant that it’s a philosophy they should try to adopt. Again, I didn’t mean to come off as harsh, I just have a hard time portraying tone over text lol.

My Coworker Won't Stop Misgendering Me AND Found My Deadname Behind My Back	"So I [24m] just found out some devastating information. So, a while ago, I talked about the lady who had been misgendering me at my job, and she still has been misgendering me, but I've kind of just been putting up with it and ignoring her. Come today, and this really nice pregnant lady that I work with, comes to me at the end of my shift and whispers to me if I'm okay with Ebony (the transphobic coworker) misgendering me and using my dead name. 

My heart dropped down to my chest because I knew Ebony was misgendering me, but I didn't know she was using my dead name, let alone even knew what it was. Everyone pretty much calls me Leo. I've only told one person my dead name, and he hates Ebony. The only way that she could have known my dead name is if she was looking over my shoulder while I clock in, or some other way. Either way, that was an invasion of privacy. I asked the pregnant lady what did she mean by Ebony has been using my dead name, and she tells me that apparently, Ebony had been talking behind my back and had said, ""Oh yea, I saw her REAL NAME,"" and kept saying it and telling the people she was talking to what my dead name was. Not only that, but the other day when I was working, I'd thought that I'd heard her call me by my dead name, but I couldn't tell because I'd only caught a little bit of what she said since I have audio processing issues and she was not fully within earshot. Now I know for a fact that she had. I ended up going to my boss about this, since he's always been respectful of me and he's going to talk to Ebony. But I'm just so upset and so hurt because who would do this? I've been nothing but nice to her, and I've only tried to be polite to her and she's only been nasty towards me going so far as to tell people private information about myself. Information that I haven't told anybody and that she has no right to tell people. She has no right telling other people's business. And the fact that I had to hear this from somebody else tells me that she knows what she's doing is wrong. If she continues to do this after my boss talks to her, I'm escalating it to HR, I'm not going to tolerate disrespect like this.

Update: My manager is reporting this to HR. I have realized that, in most places, this would absolutely be grounds for termination. there's also the fact that she has potentially put me in danger and as a target for even more discrimination by outing me and my dead name. I very much visibly pass as a man since my voice is fairly deep and I have a mustache and beard, so there is no reason she should be doing this and people at my job are constantly confused when she refers to me by the wrong pronouns. I am not the only person who sees this as a problem

[UPDATE 2 HERE ](https://www.reddit.com/user/appulfox/comments/11zkqc6/transphobic_coworker_update/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=android_app&utm_name=androidcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button)"	"Oh hell NO! Get HR involved! That is fucked
That is so wrong. I’m glad it’s been escalated to HR.  My thoughts go out to you.
Why would someone do this, its a shame how hateful people can be 

Nothing easier than making someone happy by calling them how they prefer but some people really just want to spread bad vibes 


Definitely get HR involved 

Stay strong 
Much love ❤️
Glad your boss got HR involved, I hope she gets fired for this! Keep us updated (if you feel like it)
That's seriously messed up.
let me just call this person by the wrong name 🤓
Look into your company and states anti harassment laws. Misgendering and deadnaming is harassment.
Manager complaint, then HR. That shit is fucked.
It's illegal It's a violation of title 7 and the equal opportunity employment act under the harassment clause file a complaint with your HR
“Hi this is HR how can I help?”
Gawd always transphobic people destroying a good work climate
“One of these days, I won’t be working here, and I’m going to come looking for you on the streets with a big present.”
Hit em with the uno reverse and use opposite pronouns and give them a new name
Very happy your boss is on your side. Hope to hear about her termination in update #2!
OP you seem very nice I recommend listening to some Eminem and becoming a little more fucked up
God, some people are absolute sh*tbags. I'm really sorry you're dealing with that and I hope the situation gets resolved quickly!
What a shitty person. Sorry you have to deal with that. Good job standing up for yourself. Don't let this slide.

When I came out at work I got tons of support...except for one lady. She wouldn't dead name, she just wouldn't name me period. She'd walk into a room and be like, ""Hey Christina, Hi Melissa,"" then turn to me and go, ""Hey."" I let it slide for 6 months. I only saw her like once a week, was newly out everywhere in my life, and hadn't ever had to confront anyone over something like this before. And she was being so slimy about it. Just enough transphobia so I feel it, but make it so I look overly sensitive if I complain about it and leaves her room for denying any wrong-doing.

Then one day I overheard her deadname me to a coworker and then correct herself by saying, ""Ooops, I mean..."" and then she said my actual name! But in a mocking tone. Then says something in a derisive tone that I couldn't quite make out.

I went to my boss right after that. He made it clear he would talk to her and make the expectations for how she is to treat me clear.

Next time I saw her she goes over the top, says, ""Hey name! How are you name! Nice to see you name!"" and then, ""Bye name. Have a nice night name.""

So now what? I go and complain that she's using my name TOO much???

While I was still mulling over my next step she announced she was retiring and would be leaving in two weeks.

She'd rather quit her job than say my name.

So then she puts a Trump button on her purse the size of a pancake for the last two weeks. When we were alone she tapped on it so I'd look at it and said to me in the nastiest most sarcastic tone, ""At least there's still SOME free speech in this country.""

What an insufferable ghoul she was. A born again christian, better than everyone, married four times, kids with I don't know how many guys, with a hobby of being an instigator towards any marginalized people within earshot. Fuck transphobes. I hope her hate gives her cancer.
Hope Ebony gets fired. Things like this make people scared to even show up for work. I had a friend who was sick and using the bathroom. She was texting her mom about what was going on cuz she was sick and scared and wanted advice. Her coworker came in and PEEKED THROUGH THE STALL and then told everyone she was faking and was just texting. My friend was sick coming into work because she didn't feel safe. Management did nothing....I hope something gets done about this.
Some people don't need an excuse to be cruel. Without making any assumptions about ethnicity, I am going to guess this Ebony woman is likely a person of colour and has decided to learn the wrong lessons about butting up against privilege. She has decided that, because she faced barriers and horrible humans, she is going to make someone else feel like absolute shit, just to get some sort of perverse ""justice"", and you are the easiest target.

Please let HR know that she is making your workplace toxic by her actions. Document - as much as you can - all her efforts to deadname you and misgender you. Definitely try and get some of your co-workers on side as well, it will make your case easier.
Talk to your union, NOT HR. HR exists to protect the business, NOT you.
UPDATE LINK IN THE POST
I’m so sorry man. You seem so genuinely kind and forgiving. You don’t deserve that. I’m glad the pregnant coworker let you know though— that was good of her. Good friend material
I just misgender them right back, they don't seem to like that very much 😉
Man fuck Ebony! I hope you’re alright 🙁
Damn, sorry you're going through this. I hope she gets her ass fired. What she's doing is vile. Please update us when the time comes.
If you're feeling extra spicy you could sue her for hostile work environment

Agreed, that is fucked up. I would hate that crap at work, having to see them there. That would make me want to switch locations or quit (not telling you what to do) because that is uncomfortable.
and some jackasses actually think its helpful as if you don’t have others calling you a different name for a reason.
I second this!!
bxisjx I listen to a lot of Eminem actually 🥰
i like to fuck with the lyrics of slim shady and be like ""yall act like you never seen a trans person before"" lmao
HR is the company's friend. But when their interests are aligned with yours, they're a powerful ally of convenience. Mostly it's to protect the company's ass from being buried in bad PR and legal issues. So yes, if it behooves the company to not tolerate it for legal reasons, go the fuck to HR. Jumping them is just going to make everyone, including HR, your enemy. Play things smart.

So getting misgendered in the hospital sucks	"Like idk I thought if I could be safe from that anywhere it would be here :/
But like 
Armband has male on it still 
And I keep looking at it
And everyone is ""he""ing me until I correct them 
Like basically at the point of ""here's your estrogen, sir!"" Unironically 
Idk what the point of this post is but I am bored and sad and on morphine so this is what I have to offer"	"The hospital here has the weirdest way of not gendering me. The hospital bracelet always says “Sex: Adult”. They have my legal name, and then my name in quotations and it’s really hit or miss who calls me what. The psych ward I want sent to for a month in 2020 was through them, as well as my…you know I have no clue what she is, psychiatrist? No clue. She fills my meds and makes sure I don’t currently feel like offing myself. So they have ***all*** that on file. They were definitely better about gendering me correctly and using the right name after they had it on file that it literally makes me suicidal. Not saying you should tell them that’s what it does to you, but hey maybe you could.
Literally hate it when I go to the pharmacy (with my trans flag mask on) to get my testosterone and they go ""thank you ma'am, have a nice day"" 🙄
As someone who works in a hospital I can say that it's TRUE not a safe place for people to Express themselves and their gender identity. Most of the nurses I worked with are very insensitive and flat out transphobic. I do live in the south but it was very hard to see a patient get treated that way and to think they would do the same to me.
Oh yeah, doctors fucking love asking you “is this Spiro for acne?” and then you tell them you’re trans and then literally every sentence they’ll misgender you. They live for that shit
you're in the hospital? god damn. hope you're okay. :(

here's to your recovery!
Okay. *takes deep breath* trying to shake off the disappointment in some members of my profession…

So there is something you can do.

Look around and see if there is a “patient satisfaction”, “Patient experience” person, they may have a contact number available in some of the paperwork. If not, pick up your phone and call the hospital operator. This person carries a lot of weight, and usually reports directly to the hospital CEO. The will typically come to your room and listen to what you’ve been experiencing. This is reported to the CEO. The nurse managers (all of them) are all told to correct and educate staff. The one over your floor may be told to come and apologize to you personally. They may be told to investigate your report, (they may want names) they should leave a card so you can call them. 

If none of this happens… and you are in a US hospital… you may receive a survey. Please do the survey. That survey is counted toward the hospital’s Medicare payments. If their satisfaction scores drop so does their payment amounts.
I can understand why they would give the armband simply because we were born male and male bodies do react differently  than female bodies to some medications and sometimes require a higher or lower dosage, but they should still ask prefered pronouns, that sucks.
this is the part where you disasociate into the realm you desire
Personally, a hospital is the place I would be the least offended my misgendering. They have to focus on biology over social aspects as a matter of necessity, so even if it was annoying, I would understand that medical fields are more concerned with sex than gender
[removed]
I have never been misgendered and even of they did say it, they say it in a low voice that no one would know what they said. I only ever had one worker at Pret A Manger call me sir and I reported her to their headquarters. With that said there is still discrimination here and one of the places where I find them rampan is when I look for work.
Ya cuz when you freely start editing your pronouns it confuses people
Yeah it sucks. I got misgendered after getting a vaginoplasty.....
if any one needs test pm me
I hope things get better Reily, how long and for why were you in the hospital?
""Doctor, this adult has broken their leg. Adult says it's bleeding out too--"" i can't 🤣🤣
I have to yell at my pharmacist every time I'm there because they call out my partner's deadname despite her legally changing it four years ago. Every time they point to the deadname on the file and say ""it says *deadname*"" to which I point at her chosen name in brackets DIRECTLY NEXT TO THE DEADNAME and say ""and here it says *chosen name*. the script is estrogen"". Pretty much the script for the last three years we've gone to the pharmacy. Real tired of it.
Stories like this make me feel so lucky to have such a good pharmacy. The manager is the one who handled my t the first time and I can just tell I won’t have any issues if any of her staff are transphobic towards me. 

At the end of the day, they’re the ones who look stupid. Just remember that.
OMG! Literally the SAME EXACT thing happens to me every single time! I go in wearing my Trans flag mask gaiter thing to pick up my estrogen, long hair and nails done with just about every ounce of woman energy I can give and I get “hello sir, can you read your name to me as it is on your ID? Thank you sir “ etc.
So I get to stand there feeling like shit, reading off my deadname and getting misgendered the whole time.
ima nurse and transgender ... can confirm this .. healthcare suckz :(
I don't believe this is necessarily true.  If you're on GAHT you will more likely react in a way that women do to medication because estrogen changes the physiology of your body and how it processes things.  

And certain things are particularly dangerous if they don't take into consideration that your T is suppressed and replaced with E.

Also dosages, etc. Are likely to be be in the feminine range afaik because the other stuff changes too.  For example, trans women become much less tolerant of alcohol after starting HRT.
Thanks to the sweet fuck all research done on medications and their effects on different genders, medications are typically not changed by gender (or by weight in adults it’s super weird). Ones medical history would state any current medications eg E/T and side effects of those would be considered if appropriate to the differential. 
The only time it matters (obvs other than around actual genitalia/reproduction) is for blood transfusions. Sometimes. 
Being trans in a hospital shouldn’t be the big fucking deal that it is 🤦
My cardiac symptoms match the patterns of my hormones. If this surprises anyone, they're not nice enough to acknowledge it.
Can we stop this? For real, every time the issue of “biological sex” or misgendering in medical spaces is brought up, some people come out and claim that this is necessary and useful.

No, it is not. Biological aspects include your hormone levels, and they are in fact one of the most important biological aspects. But you know what that armband that says “male” doesn’t inform any doctors about? That this person might not be running on testosterone. It is, at best, completely useless because medical personnel needs to look into the medical file anyways to find out anything relevant. At worst, it is harmful because they might make wrong assumptions based on it. 

And even if this wasn’t the case, that’s still no reason for medical personnel to misgender you to your face. There is no possible medical benefit of it.
2 things: you're still a human, and despite all of the talk about biological sex, the reality is that on HRT, your blood and many other biological factors are going to match the gender you have medically been transitioning into, rather than your assigned sex at birth. Sure there are still some differences, mainly anatomy, but even that's changeable with surgery.
“BiOloGY”…. Seriously.
Ah a d fan has made into yet another trans related sub. 🙄 surprise.

Debate pervert
Thank you. I actually only just got home like an hour ago. Went to the ER Sunday, was stuck there this whole week basically. Basically my gallbladder has been causing me to randomly get EXTREME pain when I eat certain things, and Sunday it got bad enough that I went in to find out why. So essentially that thing is broken and needs to come out, but they just kept doing tests on me (and not letting me eat at all) and whatever. I'm supposed to get surgery to get that removed next month :/ 
But yeah that whole stay sucked a lot. 
Apparently taking estrogen can increase your risk of that (granted I was already at a very high risk since I've had an eating disorder and lost a lotta weight very fast, but yeah) so be careful! It sucks!
I think you're right about all this. At the moment I'm 7 months on e, so I kind of imagine I'm in a bit of a weird place for that, where it isn't as simple as ""give her the dose you'd give a cis woman"" yet but also not just ""give her the dose you'd give a cis man"" either anymore. They of course know I'm doing HRT and for how long so I assume they've got it
The AGAB and hormone effects should be warnings on the chart to inform medical treatment, the pronouns should be included on the wristband to inform social treatment. Bam, solved.
Word on the alcohol. One drink and I’m dizzy. I haven’t touched it since. Been 2 years now. Don’t miss it anyway.
The only thing I can really imagine having any effect is anesthesia, due to how easy it is for them to kill you in general. That and long term inpatient care over someone who will lose huge amounts of weight from pre-transition due to how fatty tissues can often release chemicals that they trapped while forming.
[removed]
I would be surprised if you shouldn't be dosed as a cis woman with whatever bodyweight you have.  Changes to things like blood and physiology happen very quickly.  It's like within 3 months that your Hemoglobin, Hematocrit, and RBC get into cis female ranges.  At 7 months I would expect you would be safer on the fem doses for your weight.
If you call a woman “sir” you are not referring to a nebulous and ambiguous concept of “sex”, you are misgendering."	u6umh9	trans	542	0.98	2022-04-19 02:43:00
"I'm waiting for the day people quit saying ""biological man/male"" and ""biological woman/female"""	"It's unscientific and it implies that biological sex is binary. Unfortunately it's used by many trans people too. If you're trans and you go on hormones and get surgeries that's you changing your biology. 
AFAB/AMAB are often overused when it's unnecessary (and ends up being misgendering with extra steps) but I think they are good terms when it's actually relevant to talk about your assigned gender."	"We are all biologically a brain powering a mech made of meat and bone.
My partner stated a thing past weekend: 

Assigned genders are dumb and useless, we are gendering genitalia, and saying ""you are a woman cause you have a vulva"" Is extremely wrong in so many levels. The actual sex of a person isn't stated by genitals only (intersex folks, I support you all, big hug). He ended up saying that what we are stating on our documents is literally if we have a penis or a vagina and it blew my mind cause it's so true... We aren't showing our sex, but just our genitalias
A trans person on hormones after a couple years is biologically much closer to their preferred gender than to their AGAB.
Ikr like I'm a biological entity. I'm also a woman. Just call me what I want to be called.
ohh god ""amab/afab are often overused when unnecessary"" i could not agree more

i agree, when talking about medical things (such as surgeries, hrt, etc.) or other gender-specific things like that, amab and afab or mtf and ftm can be helpful descriptors

but the ammount i see them being used in the most unnecessary situations kinda makes me super uncomfortable

for example, i follow alot of art accnts on social media, and the ammount of times i see a ref sheet of someones character, w the trans flag and a little ""mtf"" or whatever underneath, it pisses me off! that detail had no reason to be there (there was no story-telling purposes or anything, it was there for literally no reason, and i see this happen countless of times) why cant they just put the flag, the pronouns, and MAYBE if they want put ""trans man"", ""trans woman"" or ""nb"" or something along those lines
(and i also see it be used in much similar situations but with real people, wich is a whole new level of bad)

i feel almost weird but it kinda makes me dysphoric when i see it used in unnecessary situations? like it just makes me focus so much on assigned genders that it makes me aware of my own sometimes? idk it sucks.

again, totally good descriptors to use *when necessary* but it really fucks w me when used in situations that didnt need it

(sorry for the rant)
It's just misgendering, most cis people will say anything except a trans person's gender. I'm no longer going to refer to myself as a trans woman personally, not as long as people see the words trans woman and think man. Just fed up with the inability of cis people to respect us. But I'm also mad bitter about it so hey.
Whenever someone asks me if I am a biological woman, I honestly answer - yes. I not a cyborg or an android or any other kind of synthetic organism.
Biological man/woman just sounds ridiculous and is pure transphobia.

Biologically male/female is technically valid but in practice is used in the exact same way as the above.

If it was used strictly where that biology is directly relevant (e.g. gynecological care or prostate exams) that's one thing but it's never restricted like that.

I guess I'm a synthetic girl?
For me it is an important distinction but only on regards to medical treatment. Because whilst we do alter our Hormone levels which does a lot of wonderful things, it doesn't change everything. I'm not an expert so I can't list those differences but these factors are important for medications, treatments, environmental changes etc. 

Outside of discussions with medical professionals about making sure you're functioning properly it isn't needed, just accept what people self identify and support them.

No joke, after coming out to myself was the first time I ever felt ""at home"" in my body. It was a big dissociative mess before that and I genuinely thought everyone felt like a brain in a meat mech all the time.
woah a free mech! time to cause chaos!

Tbh we're not even the ones stating it most of the time. Someone else sticks it on the documents after birth, and maybe if it was confusing to decipher then some ""corrective"" surgery was done first, and we get stuck with it for years afterwards without a say in things.
yes
At the same time as I agree and think trans women should be simply referred to as women (and likewise trans men as men), I also appreciate people who are open about their trans identity.

As a trans woman, I feel the societal pressure to blend in, to “pass,” but isn’t this a form of erasure? If I must be indistinguishable from cis women, then my trans identity is hidden from the world, and cis people can pretend I’m another cis woman and continue to be blissfully ignorant of the transgender population among them.

On one hand, I’d love to just be seen as a woman and not be targeted for being recognized as transgender. Safety is important. On the other hand, visibility is an essential element to our fight for representation; if nobody realizes we exist, we won’t be acknowledged, and our struggle for basic rights becomes that much harder.

While I completely respect the desire to call oneself simply “woman” without the need for a “trans” qualifier, I feel that in some ways this is a similar form of erasure. People harass us for being trans, so we hide our trans nature, thus allowing bigots to live at ease without being reminded of our existence.

It’s a tricky topic for sure. I think everyone should decide for themselves how transparent they wish to be about their gender in public, considering their own circumstances and risk tolerance. Which means I think we should call all trans women simply women (and trans men simply men) unless they express a preference to be identified as transgender in public. But I certainly hope that plenty of us choose to be unapologetically public about being trans, so others in hiding know they aren’t alone, and so the bigots know we’re still here, and we’re not going anywhere.
i love this
Hmm. I don't think that's right. You are organic not biologic.
You can have xy chromosomes and a uterus
Not how that works. Man and woman are nouns, male and female are adjectives. I too consider myself a woman but not a female, because I'm not a female I'm female.
How accurate is it to describe humans as non-electronic?
Yes I know... It's all so embarrassing in so many ways
What biological (organism, woman, etc) is? If I google word ""biological"" the definition is: ""Related to biology or living organisms"".
Organic means carbon containing, such as benzene. However, benzene is **probably** not alive.
I agree with you fully on your point. But the pedant in me wants to say:

When an adjective doesn't have an explicit noun it modifies (like with ""a female""), it has a ""hidden"" noun it modifies. So ""a female"" becomes ""a female (person),"" where ""(person)"" is the hidden noun.

It's an odd quirk of the English language. An adjective can't technically exist on its own. It needs to modify something, but this ""something"" can be implied, which makes sentences less clunky.

Thanks for listening to my English lesson!

I'm a minor with cancer, does anyone know if I can legally stop my parents misgendering me on my grave if I die?	"TW cancer, death talk.

I live in Utah so I know it's a long shot. My parents absolutely do not accept me being trans and since I got diagnosed with a brain tumor they think that's what's causing me to think I'm trans (🙄🙄🙄). I'm really scared that if I die I'll end up being misgendered and dead named all through my funeral and on my grave. Maybe it's a dumb thing to worry about while I'm literally in treatment for cancer and I need to focus on trying to get better but I can't stop thinking about my grave just being there forever with the wrong name on it."	"I have no idea if this is applicable to minors, but caitlyn doughty (ask a mortician) has made a youtube video with advice for making sure your funeral wishes are respected as a trans person. I hope that advice is applicable to minors too
Omg I wish you all the best and a safe recovery!
This probably depends on Utah state law, but is writing it in a will possible for minors? Maybe through a trans youth organization? The only other legal way I can think of would be a contract which they'd ofc have to sign...
Stay strong 💪!
http://glad.org/ and http://lambdalegal.org/ should be able to help you find the info you need.
Since you’re a minor, I don’t know if you can draft a will. However, your healthcare company has a form called an advance directive. I recently filled one out and it included end of life planning. It’s legally binding while you’re under the care of doctors, and more of a grey area after that, because it IS a notarized document that states your wishes clearly. 

Your parents need a serious reality check on your having a brain tumor though. That’s dangerously incorrect for them to ascribe normal behaviors to a very serious medical issue. Have they spoken to your doctors about this? 

Its sooo important that you have the space to feel like YOU while you’re healing and getting treatment. Stress reduction has a profound impact on that. The trans community has your back❤️
I’m an anatomy nerd and I can definitively tell you without a scan that your tumor does not press on your insular cortex, anterior cingulate cortex, and the medial prefrontal cortex all at the exact same time to impact your self identification. Calling BS! You do you.
That is not a dumb thing to worry about at all. I have become very comfortable with talking about death. I don’t have any answers but I’m here to talk if you need me.
Hey sweetie, you've got this. Take it from me  the last thing you need to be thinking about now is funerals. You need to stay positive and focus on the future. In 2007 I was given a 3% chance to make it to 2010 and 1% to get to 2012. I'm still here. So look at positive things, who you're going to be when the treatment is finished.
I don’t have an answer to this but just know that I send you love and hugs ❤️❤️
I would check to see if it is state law that your birth certificate name has to be on gravestone.  

The only reason I say this.  I saw a post on fb and parents couldn’t put the child’s true name on gravestone and it was very heartbreaking. 

Maybe just google your state or area and see what can be on gravestone.   

Best of luck with your journey.
Ever since I became an atheist, this has been my biggest thing as well. I don't fear mortality anymore, as weird as that sounds. I fear the idea of me being tainted. If thats all that will be left behind I want it to be me, not some figment or lie. I don't have an answer for you but you have our full support <3
I’m so sorry to hear, I hope you have a smooth recovery and it doesn’t have to come down to that, stay strong you can do it
I don't think that's a dumb thing to worry about at all. I'm (relatively) healthy and even *I* have been concerned about those things occasionally. I'm sorry I don't have any advice for you that others havent already given but hang in there if you can
I went to school to be a funeral director so I know that  when it comes to serious medical issues we have to sometimes ask ourselves morbid questions so I don’t  think you’re dumb or a weirdo for being concerned about this. Especially being trans and having unaccepting parents! That adds a-whole-nother layer of stress that you don’t need, especially at a time like this.   
I don’t know what your prognosis is but I wonder; are you in your early or late teens? If you’re currently in treatment, obviously (and hopefully!), you could go into remission and the headstone issue could become a non-issue. Or the treatment could buy you enough time to become a legal adult and get a legal name change/advanced directive.   
You could always look into emancipation but that could be a big problem since I imagine you’re on your parents’ insurance, and having health insurance right now is very important. I’m not a legal expert, but I wonder if there’s some way to get a legal name change/advanced directive without their permission. There should be some sort of free legal aid society in your city/county that you can call and ask about these things and there’s a lot of LGBTQ+ lawyers who take cases Pro Bono (at no cost).  
I hope I didn’t sound too blunt or morbid but I know that if you’ve dealt with so much at such a young age you’re used to harsh realities. And I wish you weren’t used to it!!! I just wanted to give you as much info as I could that might help you.   
ALSO, remember you’re still in treatment! So as trite as it sounds, don’t lose hope!!! Planning ahead isn’t bad but don’t forget to live 💕💗💕
Hello, friend,

That’s not a dumb thing to worry about at all! I don’t really have much advice, but you can always make some sort of plan with your friends? Like a really informal living will—I’m not sure, I’ve never been around for that type of planning. 

I’m not sure if a personal story would help? 
Uhm, my nana had leukemia—I wasn’t alive yet. My mom was 15, my uncle was 9(10?), and her parents are/were divorced. So, basically, she had no one. She had to bring the mortgage bills to the hospital so her mom could help her do them. All of the doctors, and attorneys and shit were certain that my nana was going to die. They didn’t talk about it like “if she goes,” it was much more “when she goes.” 
And she didn’t die. I mean, she did—but not from leukemia at least. She got leukemia, then had a heart transplant. Later on, she got Parkinson’s and she died during quarantine. She was 78 or 79 if I remember right. 
From what I’ve heard, unless doctors catch it really early, you’re always going to be having someone going on about “if/when you die.” If it’s not someone else, then it’s you—because who wouldn’t worry about that? 
If you don’t mind my asking, how much have you talked to your doctors about your transition/gender identity?
Only if you divorce them and start living on your own.  You can be emancipated from your parents but otherwise they control everything legal.
It is absolutely stupid to worry about it. If you're going to die from cancer, gender is the last thing ANYBODY should be worrying about.
Hope. My friend use to have Cancer. Her mother didn't make it unfortunately from also dying from cancer. She had it in her brain like you. She told me about her boyfriend that is a rasta and he gave her medical Marijuana that at first slowed down the process of the tumor growth and from more excessive smoking she went back for another check up after a while and the doctors said the tumor has reduced to nothing basically and she is still living healthy years onwards. The strain of Marijuana she smoked is ""Blue Dream"" specifically. You have a chance to get proper help from nature
[removed]
I can't find any info on whether minors can make a living will but I don't think I can.
Can I get a link?
It looks like minors can't have advanced directives.
Try telling my parents that 🙄
I can't help it, if it was that easy to just ""stay positive"", I obviously would be, but the reality is I have a disease that could be fatal and I'm terrified I'll never get to be my true self and my deadname will be on my grave forever. I wish I could stop worrying about it but I can't.
There doesn't seem to be any laws like that here.
Looks like it's not possible for minors to get an advanced directive at all or get a name change without parental permission 😭 I'm 15 so I have to wait 3 years.
>you can always make some sort of plan with your friends?

I don't have any of those 😥

>how much have you talked to your doctors about your transition/gender identity?

I haven't.
I don't think you can just get emancipated without already being independent. Plus... I need their health insurance for treatment.
I can't help it.
Wow cool a treatment I have absolutely no way of getting, thanks.
https://youtu.be/PVgumSUZQRI
I’m so sorry that’s the case. If you’re in a large hospital system or one of the big medical groups there is a patient advocate you can speak to. I don’t know how it works for minors, but part of their job is to get families all on board with patient preferences. 
It’s possible one has already been assigned to your case specifically though, is there a counselor or clinical social worker your family sees together? 

I did a quick scan of minor patient rights in your state and it looks like they default to HIPAA and doctor discretion, basically the national standard. So it doesn’t look like there’s anything *preventing* you from advocating on your own, within normal limits. 

On the other hand, is there any way to present information about transness in a way your parents would be more receptive to? Would it be helpful to hear it from an expert? Or a religious source? Or broken down into easy-to-understand terms? 
There are a ton of resources out there for parents so maybe finding the right one can make a big difference.
I understand  hun, tbh I don't think any of us who have gone through cancer ever stops worrying. The only thing I can say is to try to find the silver lining in the clouds.
That is good news.  On another note I’m hoping you can find your answer.  Ultimately I hope you a have a long life yet to live.
I’m so sorry you’re going through all this. You shouldn’t have to worry about these things especially at such a young age, the laws should be different. But remember that you’re still in treatment so don’t
write your life off as a lost cause. Modern medicine can do so much.   
In regards to your general fears and anxieties about death, is that something you might feel comfortable talking to one of your doctors/oncologist about? That’s something most people going through treatment deal with so they might be able to help you manage it if it’s been swirling around your mind a lot.   
I won’t tell you to “try not to think about it” because that would be silly and condescending, but I would say to try not to *ruminate* on the ‘what-ifs’.   
And also remember you’ve got tons of people on this sub who are 100% in your corner 100% of the time.
If you feel comfortable, you can talk to your doctors. Remember, they have to abide by HIPAA, meaning that they can’t tell your parents, or anyone else for that matter, (unless your a danger to yourself, others, or being abused—those are the only exceptions). In your case, they might be able to help—and if not, then hey, now you have someone using the proper name and pronouns. You’re in a sucky situation, so I really hope that you come out alright in the end. Best of luck, friend :)
I'm sorry, there's no easy answer I can give you

It is possible to get emancipated but I recognize that might be impossible for you.

I can't ease your pain but I will pray for you.
Well if you cant help it, not much you can do. I hope you get better, dont die
Wow okay, it's online. But nvm I don't want to help you coz you're rude
Thank you! I think I'm going to make a living will.
>is there any way to present information about transness in a way your parents would be more receptive to?

No. My entire family *hates* trans people and would never accept it for any reason.
What silver lining could having a brain tumor possibly have???
Please don't. No offence but with all the religious trauma I've had, people saying they're praying for me isn't a comfort it's actually really uncomfortable for me.
So I'm supposed to buy illegal drugs online with the zero money I have and hope my parents don't open my mail which they 100% would. And telling you I can't do that is rude? Lmao
Don't reply
I don't think they meant a brain tumor has a silver lining. Just that you should try to find the positives. Obviously easier said than done but it's important to focus on that. People with conditions like this are more likely to survive if they keep a positive attitude. We don't yet know why but studies of thousands of patients over decades now seem to indicate this.

Plus you're still young and that is definitely a positive. Younger people are more likely to beat cancer. I know this part will sound a little grim but do you want to spend what might be your last years focusing on the bad or the good? You're alive now and that's awesome because you've already beat those odds. This is just a speed bump.

I can't give you legal advice as I don't know of there's anything you can do to stop them other than perhaps look into what it would take to be emancipated of you're old enough. I'm sure there's a lot of hoops to jump through. You might even find a lawyer that'll take your case pro bono.

I hope you find your silver lining 💜
Sorry that was thoughtless, what I meant is I'm supporting you and thinking of you.
It's legal in states and it's not a drug it's a plant that heals nturally. Anyway I'm done don't talk to me. Go look it up if you want to but I'm out
Personally I think it's important to hope for the best but still plan for the worst just in case.
It's not legal here, and especially not for kids... and just because it's a plant doesn't mean it's not a drug 😂 it's definitely a drug
That's my point. You obviously aren't going to forget about it but dwelling on it won't do you any good either. But if nothing else you have something most people don't get which is motivation. You never know when life is going to be over so live it as full as you can try to love every moment. Good luck and I hope you get what you desire.
>live it as full as you can try to love every moment.

Wow if only I could do that.
You can if you try. You'll never get every single thing you want out of life but that's kind of the point. You experience pleasure and pain. It's just part of the duality of life.
Well so far it's only been pain."	qzizj2	trans	500	0.99	2021-11-22 11:01:51
Got misgendered like 5 different times today... once accidentally by my gf :/ she felt really bad after. Could use some reassurance... three months on T 👦🏻		"I don’t know what else to say other then HOW? You do not look like a girl. I have know idea how that happened, that sounds weird to me, but you look very cool.
Dude you look so cool!
It's early days, brother. Soon you'll be so masculine in her eyes that today will be a distant memory. T works quick, you just need time.

Be gentle with yourself, brother. The future is an unwinding road. Xxx
go off king !! such a handsome guy wow
omg you look so cool and handsome!
Damn, you look fine as hell
I mean, you look a bit like my friend felix, and he's great so...
m8, you look masc as fuck. just keep at it and try not to let shit like this down, king.
you look masculine as fuck my guy, don’t worry about them
You are masculine as fuck. Even with just 3 months of T.
 I know its hard to be misgendered. My parter is trans and her best friend is trans. I sometimes misgender her friend and I feel terrible about it. Its a shit habit, but it is habit. The thing is with time and patience, it will be broken. I hope for the best for you!!!
yo man! thats annoying! your pretty darn handsome haha
My king, you are a handsome and stunning human being
What a handsome dude! I'm so sorry people are asses (not your girlfriend just the other people) just know you have our support. I come here too when something happens and it makes me feel a lot better that there is a community that understands

Dude you look great. You look more male than I did before I started to transition (mtf)
You look great! The only thing I might suggest (if that's ok, you can tell me to shut up if not) would be trying to thicken your eyebrows somehow. Maybe with some makeup if you're comfortable with it
Dude, you look good. Don’t let them get you down. You got this, bro.
looking good man!
You look great king ♥️♥️♥️
Woah!!! Love the shirt bro! Looking super handsome my man

I got misgendered by my doctor and it was awesome	"Hey, everyone.

Before you make any assumptions based on the title, please allow me to tell you my tale! :)

I had an appointment with my doctor to whom I came out last year. Today she misgendered me and the conversation was like this:

Her: ""Are you feeling nervous?"" (Using feminine pronouns)
Me: ""You mean nervous? (Using male pronouns)""
Her: (visibly embarrassed) ""I'm so sorry! Yes, that's what I meant! My gosh, forgive me, I'm still forgetting about your pronouns.""
Me: (chuckling and honestly happy af about how considerate, caring and sweet she was): ""It's quite alright!""

Then she misgendered me again:

Her: ""But are you feeling tired?"" (Using feminine pronouns)
Me: ""Ahem. Tired. Hahaha."" (Correcting her, using masculine pronouns)
Her: (chuckles a bit) ""Oh my gosh, I'm sorry! I'm not trying to do this on purpose nor anything! I just keep forgetting! But you, keep correcting me, always! So that I can get it though my head that you are a he/him!"" 

So yes, it was awesome, wholesome and amazing. Sure, she misgendered me, but do you see how considerate, comprehensive, sweet and caring she was? She's an incredible doctor and I'm so grateful for having her in my life, I appreciate it a lot that she corrected herself afterwards. Plus, she's fun! We managed to have a good laugh about the situation! :)

BONUS: My first appointment towards my transition is this year!!!!"	"Is this one of those languages, in which verbs have male and female forms (like my native Polish)?
Being misgendered sucks but if the person doing it immediately apologizes and is actually making an effort, then it really isn’t that big a deal. The only time it really bothers me is when somebody goes out of their way to make fun of me
TBH it sounds like you're the one who's awesome and handled the situation like a boss!
My Rheumatologist both times that I have seen her since coming out, while being pleasant in demeanor has misgendered me when doing the post appointment summary for her records. She rapid fires the masculine pronouns and it's like having a pallet of bricks getting dropped on your chest repeatedly. I don't think it's done to be malicious but it still hurts none-the-less.
Yes, precisely.

Edit: Misread the question, haha. No, only our nouns, adjectives and substantives are gendered (feminine and masculine). Our verbs aren't gendered. But in my talk with my doctor, we were using adjectives. 
I'm so sorry for the fuss, everyone, haha.
dzien dobry
I’m glad I half ass tried to learn German so I could know other languages have gendered words
Yes, exactly. My point is sometimes these things can go right and even make us feel good - because there are people out there making an effort to do their best to respect us, our identity and who we are. 
Same here, I absolutely hate when people weaponize pronouns aka deliberately misgendering someone just to hurt them/get to them, it's messed up.
This is huge
Really? Thank you so much, haha!
I'm so sorry to hear that. That's awful, I know what you mean, maybe you could try correcting her or reminding her what your pronouns are? And if she cares (hopefully), she'll respect them and do her best remember who you are. 
It's most likely not meant to be malicious, but yes, it does hurt, I understand perfectly. Which is why I really suggest you bring this topic into discussion during your next appointment, so that you don't feel anymore unnecessarily hurt. You deserve to feel good and respected.
French?
Witom :3
Jak się macie się?

Mój polskie nie jest dobry.
French is a Romance language, which uses gendered nouns and adjectives, though not verbs.
Nope, haha.
I feel excluded here
C’est ma langue maternelle lol

Pis c’est laid comme langue

(It’s my original language and it’s ugly)
You have gendered forms for verbs in french, which are based on the gender of the subject

Ça dépend. Mais le manque de pronoms neutres en français m'énerve un peu.

My cat works in the library. He drank a lot of tequila. He is dead.

I used to work with a lot of Mexican ladies that didn’t speak English. I pieced together this ridiculous statement from my brief study of Spanish in high school to make them laugh. It worked every time. :)"	svrufi	trans	494	0.98	2022-02-18 20:39:40
They said my name 103 times	"So I've been noticing people tend to say my name instead of my pronouns all the time. So when my mom had this support person ( or whatever you call it. Annoying government lady basically) I counted how many times they said my name in 1 hour. They said my name a total of 103 times. They said my pronouns 5 times max (because I corrected them)

In one sentence my mom managed to said my name 3 times. This goes to show how sick and tired I am of people either misgendering me or refusing to use any pronouns. I said twice during that hour that they had said my name way too many times. As always no response. 
This is once again why I don't wanna go outside or let alone interact with people"	"Sorry to hear that, I totally feel this. 

Recently, at work, I've noticed people use my name a lot, when I first started interacting with some of these people they would like start to say something that sounded like they were going to use a pronoun then stop themselves and say my name instead. It's really annoying and sadly I don't have a lot of hope that it's going to improve until or unless I look super fem and get correctly gendered to begin with, even then who knows.
Relatable. Especially my dad, overusing my name, putting it in front of pretty much every sentence directed at me. Meanwhile I can't remember my parents using my pronouns or referring to me as their daughter a single time apart from an awkward birthday song.
I came out to my general doctor a few years ago, and changed my gender to nonbinary in my medical records. In his notes for that visit, he used a variety of different pronouns, like he didn't know which to say (I asked him to use she). Since then, he avoids using pronouns at all in my visit notes, and just refers to me as ""the patient.""
I am a mom of a beautiful boy. I started going to a support group for parent/caregivers of trans youth. In the months since this November, my mind and thoughts have gone through many emotions, some that I am not proud of.
I can only imagine what you are going through, because I see my son going through some of the same things with pronouns and chosen name.

I hope those people will understand sooner than later how important it is to use chosen names and pronouns. It’s something so simple that shouldn’t be a problem for people.

I have to say, I am glad you posted this, because even those of us who say we are supportive, we need a wake up call.
This happens to me too - my pronouns are they/them and I don’t pass, and people always just use my name instead of my pronouns 😓.  I’m sorry this happens to you.  I hope it gets better.
Sorry for you, that sucks

I’ve been out for a while to my SUPPORTIVE - some of them are trans and they get called their preferred pronouns all the time - friends and they keep calling me my name, I’ve never been called a “he” by them. I think it’s weird
I dont have that with random people, but my parents are overusing my deadname too. Like, for some reason even if they are talking to me face to face, they still use deadname as if I fucking didnt know they are talking to me. Oh, and my additional English lessons tutor does that too -_-
i feel this - i’m stealth so don’t blame yourself for this, it has nothing to do with the way you look or pass.
My gf is mtf, I still struggle with other people's pronouns. It's my opinion if they are using your name instead it means they are atleast trying. When I changed my own name, it still took forever for people to get it right. They would instead just try not to say my name at all. It feels worse because your in the thick of it. I'm sorry for the way you feel but it will get better, and remember to be patient with people.
I am the honestly the most petty little shit in the world. If someone says my name, I just ignore them, or act like I didn't hear them. This makes me feel less tied to my name, and it's also kind of funny watching people go ""wtf?""
I am not completely aware of what your situation is but at least for you mom shes going through this transition with you as well so it's probably hard for her to get used to it. Ofc like I said I dont know your situation so if this doesn't apply to you then rip, and for the weird government lady maybe she needs a new job.
I mean yeah this sucks and all and I'm proud of you for calling it out. But tbh some days i would welcome this stealth, nobody even makes a shitty veiled effort like this on my behalf. I'm so tired that i would probably just accept it with relief. It's weird to think that even some of the first civilizations were smart enough to be like ""fuck who you wanna fuck change ur name to whatever idc we're still drinking m8s"" (looking @ the roman empire here) when ""advanced"" society managed to fucking completely regress into religious social structures 😩
That’s totally understandable. To be honest I feel like someone saying my name multiple times is way better than them messing up the pronoun constantly. Which most likely if they’re saying your name they know that they might mess up a few times with your pronouns so they just say your name so they’re on the safe side. 
It’s so frustrating though, like I don’t want to go out because I know I don’t pass, and I have nothing against people who use the wrong pronouns on me by accident. It just makes me feel like crap though!!!
I feel this and deal with this on a daily basis but I don’t say anything about it because I don’t want to feel like an a hole for simply just correcting them on my pronouns.
My mom does this aswell, I think it's because she still hasn't come to terms with me being trans (she's talked to my friends about how she thinks it's a phase). She'll also either use a nickname of my dead name or my preferred name until someone else uses my pronouns.

I hope people start using your preferred pronouns cuz this situation sucks.
Some of my teachers did this. Like how? Ive never heard my name so many times.
I'm little confused, they are using your prefered name or deadname? You are binary? Because on my language we don't have a neutral gender, so to don't use wrong pronoums with non-binary people I use the name instead, for example: Max is cool vs She is cool or He is cool (but on my language, on english I use they for most people I don't know the gender)
I wouldnt have the conceration to count that much lol
In my experience, people who do this sometimes are afraid of hurting you by getting your pronouns wrong so they prefer to tip-toe around it by using your name, which can be much easier to adjust to in many cases. When I sat my parents down to talk about this it turned out they felt like that but they also didn't like the embarrassment of being wrong. It took me explaining how much the lack of effort hurts me for them to want to change.

I have a method that works for me when I get someone's name or pronouns wrong and so far has worked for others when I tell them to try the same. Every time I get told that I said the wrong name or pronouns, in the next spare moment I have I will consciously and deliberately think or say quietly 3 or 4 full sentences using the correct name or pronouns. I'm essentially forcing myself to practice the right way to address someone every time I screw up.

If you want their behavior to change, you have to not only point out the behavior but tell them how it makes you feel. Once they understand how much it hurts to have your pronouns ignored, then you can introduce the idea of practicing it the right way.
I fuck up pronouns at a weirdly common rate. They exist in our brain in a different linguistic space and it requires different effort. *Some times* this is why people overuse names, because they are much more unique and mentally transition easier.

Other times its because of other they have real issues and/or are butts.
One thing I learned in my 7 years of being trans is that people have an easier time saying your pronouns when you start sounding and looking fem. Our brain loves patterns and from the time we are toddlers we are taught which gender pronouns for which genders and what the genders look like typically. It's hard to break out of that program and even when you break out of the pattern, you can still mess up because you never truly break out. So be understanding when someone messes up, they may not even mean to.
Change your name every week. Maybe if they can't keep up they'll just use your pronouns because its easier

^(~~this is actually probably a bad idea~~)
I’m sorry, it can be super hurtful, and can make you feel neglected. But understand that people aren’t computers, you can’t feed them new information that without question instantaneously incorporated and dispensed as fact. My best friends use my name a lot, because they are going against upwards of 20 years of knowing and calling me different. Correct, educate, and forgive, the only person who never stumbled was my wife, but probably only because she only knew me as a cis male for like 2 months before I came out to her, she has always known me for truth, and until the time before is eclipsed by the time after your going to get a lot of your name, and a lot of half choked out, or hesitated pauses on your pronouns. Give it time.
I overuse names whenever I'm unsure about what pronouns a person would prefer--for example, at work we've got a profile field for pronouns but almost nobody seems to use it. I also have kind of a bad memory, and in a diverse workforce with people from lots of cultures with unfamiliar-to-me names, I get nervous that I'm going to accidentally misgender someone whose face I can't see and whose name doesn't appear in my internal lists of ""probably masculine names"" nor ""probably feminine names"".

And now, seeing your post among many others, I find out that avoiding pronoun use can itself *also* trigger dysphoria. TT\_TT I just want to avoid hurting people with the words I use.

I'm sorry that bothers you, tho personally only referring to people by their name is personally how I talk to pretty much refer to everyone that way
People have to get used to it, I didn't this at one point in my life. Being mad at them isn't gonna help
Damn, ppl who are trying not to offend u offend u more? Like damn
They are probably scared to say your pronouns wrong so they just go by your name.
I feel this. I've been a woman without a name since January. In person I've heard my name twice now and my pronouns maybe half a dozen times. 

Dead name or pronouns though, those are a daily occurrence even if they are normally followed by a 'sorry'.
Why did you count to the exact number?
>it's going to improve until or unless I look super fem

Honestly I don't think this would make a difference. If they've decided to never use your pronoun you could look like you were cis ans they'd still do this 😔
It's so sad. But because they aren't directly misgendering they can't be called out 😔
Since he's a doctor that strikes me as transphobic cause legally he'd probably be fired for misgendering but he also doesn't wanna use your preferred pronouns so this happens
> I started going to a support group for parent/caregivers of trans youth

Hmm that's interesting. Imma try and see if I can find one for my mom too, she might really benefit from it :0

>I hope those people will understand sooner than later how important it is to use chosen names and pronouns.

Yeah :(
My brother who's an adult said ""no dick no he/him"" so it's been quite difficult. And my dad said if I got HRT he'd disown me 🥲

>I have to say, I am glad you posted this, because even those of us who say we are supportive, we need a wake up call.

It was more so just me venting but I'm glad it helped in some way 🥺!
I pass with a mask on. I'm afab but at gas stations employees have followed me into the bathroom several times because they think I'm a man and like even new bosses think I'm a man (i was thankfully blessed with an androgynous first name) and I've gotten to the point where if someone is too stubborn to call me they/them, i tell them outright to use he/him, and they ""can't"" do that either. Which is hilarious because for these same people seeing my name and photo on paper, it usually takes them a few days to switch gears from he/him to she/her. I feel ashamed for caving to meet the ""forgetful"" people halfway because it's just thinly veiled malicious transphobia, but I'm already in enough pain on a daily basis and this shit wears on u.
It took a while for them to get used to name but I've been out for over a year. My pronouns is not a new thing. Sometimes when I correct people instead of saying my pronounce they correct to my name. They're making a contious effort to not say my pronouns and while it is better than being full on transphobic it still makes me extremely uncomfortable. Besides if they can put in the effort to only say my name why can't they just use the right pronoun
Yeah like, it could be worse. Bit it still feels like they're denying my gender identity by saying name only :/
Especially cause I've said it makes me uncomfortable when they don't use my pronouns ever but they don't care
At least it's my preferred name. If it'd been my deadname I would've cried 😩
I'm trans-masc nonbinary
Some people are just really awkward about it too
Same. Not all the time, but I wonder if it's to do with ADHD. Sometimes my brain defaults to a set and doesn't do the check to make sure if they're right. I do it to literally everyone though, not just trans people.
It's chosen name, but again, the problem is I've brought it up to my mom and well everyone else multiple times that I don't like being referred to only by name but as usual no one cares about my opinion 🥲
I just get talked over or ignored
I know. I used to use they/them so I understand how that could be difficult but I switched to he/him to fit into the heteronormative boxes but even that doesn't help. They're used to he/him they say it every day and use it without problem about cis guys.
But me? Nope, just name.
Again. I've mentioned a dozen times to them how I don't like being referred to by name only but no one cares
Remember when anti-queer workplace laws/standards were passed and the cishets were fuckin outraged but the queers were like ""lmao big if enforced"" and then nothing changed? Unrelated haha just wondering
how about ... decide on a a new name ? :D
like ... using someones name is pretty important in most languages aslong as you dont want peopme to point at you all day so ppm know who they refer to
.... or remembering the right pronouns is difficult when you’re scatterbrained and don’t want to get them wrong?

I know that I would prefer being referred to as my name instead of the wrong pronouns. 

I dunno, context means a lot, and I could very well have such poor self esteem that I’ll let people walk all over me.
If your dad says you being more happy and comfortable in the one and only body you have will cause him to disown you, let him. Someone that selfish and toxic is not worth keeping in your life. Sorry if that's harsh, but... it's just how I feel :p
They don't want to fuck up your pronouns? They are worried they will fuck it up, so they avoid it all together. I don't want to sound like I don't care because I do, but you have to allow people to make mistakes. If they aren't being genuine that's one thing, but from what you said they weren't being outrageous or cruel. Correct me if I'm wrong about this. 

Cis hetero people don't encounter any LGBT in there day to day 99% of the time. What we want the world to be and what it actually is, can be frustrating. It's up to us to be patient and keep composure while talking down the actual hate. In their heads it's like asking someone to call a deer a bird, and when they aren't paying attention to how much they care or not about you they simply say what their brains have been trained to say. Given time(training) they will say the thing that gives you validation.

You say it's been a year, but life if looooong. Good luck.
I think the main thing is anytime it’s out of the normal it just reminds us that we’re transitioning and weren’t born the correct gender at birth. I think that’s the thing that gets me the most at least. 

Each time someone does something weird with our names or pronouns we notice and it makes us feel crappy. Even if it’s not particularly offensive or them doing it on purpose
You can explain the problem? I really want to understand to don't make my friends feel down if I'm saying their names too much.
I don't remember that-
I usually keep up with lgbt news but until last year I've been living under a rock practically
I've had people suggest this to me before to make the line ""cleaner"" (even tho Peyton is already a wildly androgynous name) and it strikes me as off. I'm not gonna go to the effort of changing something as important as my name just so some intolerant plebs feel more comfortable respecting me. Names, as you said, are very important. Being saddled with one you adopted just to maybe get some respect would probably suck if it turned out to be a useless endeavor.
I sincerely hope that a medical doctor isn't scatterbrained enough to forget a patient's pronouns when they're staring at the note in a chart lmao holy shit. Please don't act like doctors are held to a lower standard, that's a terrifying thought
A doctor that scatterbrained should be fired.
True, it's still hard tho 😮‍💨
At least he hasn't been a huge part of my life, it would've been harder if I had to cut my mom out
>They don't want to fuck up your pronouns? They are worried they will fuck it up, so they avoid it all together.

Yes I know this but that doesn't make it any better. Not trying to me feels just as bad because they're basically indirectly refusing to see me as a guy. 

>. I don't want to sound like I don't care because I do, but you have to allow people to make mistakes

I don't mind if people misgender me on accident.  My problem is when they don't even try. There's a difference between overall gendering me right and slipping up here and there and not trying period.

I'm honestly sick and tired of people who'll go 
""And then she did this and then she said- oh sorry HE. Anyway then she went so and so place"" 
Literally this ⬆️⬆️

>Given time(training) they will say the thing that gives you validation

It won't improve if there is no training and they just say whatever because if I correct them I'm the woke pronouns police. 

>In their heads it's like asking someone to call a deer a bird

In my head being misgendered is the same as if you called an overweight person ""fatty"" and refused to stop. That's considered bullying but when it's done to trans people it's just brushed off as something you have to learn to deal with. 

>You say it's been a year, but life if looooong. Good luck.

I'm honestly just so done. I'd rather never leave my home again than be misgendered cause I simply can't do it anymore
It's not saying name too much. What I mean when I day ""saying my name too much"" I mean instead of pronouns. The problem is when someone ONLY  uses my name it feels like they're denying my gender identity's existence by refusing to use pronouns. That's the problem
well .. my deadname is rather male .. and i really DONT wana be called that for the rest of my life 😅
You didn't choose this road you got set on it. You have to deal with it. Your already getting thicker skin dealing with it. If your not in school no one helps you with bullying. Give it time, you will get better at dealing with the bigots and there will be less bigots to deal with. Take care please. 

Edit: updooted all your comments and your post for love. Your welcome to pm me I will use any pronouns you want.
Hummm, so you have a pronoum and it's easy to say on your language and people refuse to use the pronoum, different from the right pronoum don't existing on the language and using the name to not misgender, I think I understood.
I don't think the issue was being called by their deadname / not having a new, gender-aligned name; I think it's that their parents are *only* using their names. Refusing to use their correct pronouns - consciously or not - as much as possible.
I just wanted to quickly chime in here. I know that I use my own child's name more than pronouns because it's still a transition for me, the loving parent that fully supports her and everyone.

I think part of the reason that I use her name more than pronouns is just because it's how I talk. When I converse with others, I tend to use names more than pronouns. When I tell a story about someone, I use names more than pronouns.

So do I think that the OP is right? Sure, I can totally see the point being made, but on the other hand I can see how u/CollectiveUD made valid points too. It's a balancing act to respect other's while receiving the respect back. Part of that is to have empathy, understanding and openness of what bothers you and why. While trying to see it from the other's standpoint also.

Only love to you both.
oooouh .. well ... i mean thats still better then beeing misgendered constantly by your parents and them actively telling people youre their son when people talk to you as a girl ...
I mean its not great .. but atleast thats something
The thing is I've brought it up to people multiple times especially my mom how it makes me uncomfortable to practically only be referred to by name ( I also try to point out when people have said my name too many times ) but like I said, nothing helps, they just ignore me or talk over me 😞
Which is why I get so upset about. Sure it's better than be misgendered ( even tho that happens daily too) but only referring to me by name kinda feels like people are denying my gender identity even when I've pointed it out to them that this ""neutral"" approach also makes me uncomfortable 😮‍💨
Sadly I get this too sorta 🥲
She'll refer to me as her teenager even tho I told her I'm okay being called son. I know if could be worse but in this case even ""neutral"" feels bad cause it basically feels like she and everyone else are denying my gender identity by for example only referring to me by name
I'm sorry you have to deal with that. 😥 And yes, we all have our own battles, some probably worse than others, but no one person's struggle invalidates anyone else's. We're all here to support each other when it's needed. 💜"	un6u2a	trans	496	0.95	2022-05-11 10:34:03
Need a second opinion. Would I be in the wrong for this?	"I have a very Christian/Conservative family and my father is very transphobic. I came out to my parents almost 7 months ago my mom isn’t supportive but she supports my right to be who I want to be. My dad however had some things to say about it and wasn’t very nice about it to the point where I moved out for my own mental health. I know he cares about me but he’s very stuck in his ways and hates that I’m trans and “doesn’t believe” that I am. He had previously asked me to show up as “deadname” to holidays which I have abode by every time I’ve showed up around him and the rest of my family. I’ve let them deadname me and misgender me hoping that they will come around eventually. 

Well this coming Easter Sunday I want to show up as me. I want to paint my nails, do my makeup, and wear what I want to wear. I have asked a friend to come with me that my parents are familiar with to keep me comfortable and be there to support me. The only thing is that my grandparents will also be there. I have not come out to them yet and don’t know how they will react. It’s not my intent to stir drama but I have a feeling that it will. I only want to finally stop caring about what my family says or thinks about me and make a point that this is who I am and im no longer going to just roll over. 

So my question is would it be inconsiderate to come out to my grandparents this way and to possibly “disrespect” my father by showing up in my girl clothes when he asked me not to? Especially since it will be in front of his parents as well.

[UPDATE] post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/u6mp4k/update_post_i_did_it_i_went_to_easter_as_myself/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) for anyone who’s curious how it went :)"	"If they’re inviting “deadname” they haven’t been inviting you. Rude. Time to crash the party. It’s only stirring drama if they choose to be dramatic about it.

Provided you’re reasonably sure you’ll be safe, of course. But that’s my only issue.
Show up as you. You're living independently so he can't do anything in retaliation. It is not inconsiderate. And if you embarrass him- he's an ass, so that's a win.

&#x200B;

That being said might I suggest you and your friend go equipped with 2-4 cans of pepper spray each to act as a painscreen (like how destroyers used to be able to make smokescreens) in the event of the need to retreat because the crap has hit the fan.
I support you going as yourself and you deserve to live authentically in the presence of your family as well.

I would consider if that's truly the way you want to come out to your grandparents. While I think it's great that you're being yourself, transitioning is big news and it would be kinder to them if you would tell them beforehand.
I would normally reply to the person who replied before me as I do agree while heartedly with their statement however, it does need to be said that you may not be allowed entry into their home when doing that. As from your explanation it sounds like that household is very much run in the ideals of Christianity meaning your father/sire holds all the say ( to explain the use of sire; I don't like calling people who don't support their children their parents, he's just the sperm donor in my eyes, don't mean any offense and I'm sorry if it does offend )

You are you, you are valid, if you are capable of living in your own than there's no reason to be involved with toxic people and that's exactly what those two are doing, it's completely different if they are trying to accommodate you and just messing up, that's growing pains, but they don't sound like they WANT to try meaning it's toxic af.

Having a friend with you is a good idea, when I first came out it was too people I knew wouldn't change how they treated me, just respect and support me, then I went to everyone else with those people help as I myself don't have a very strong backbone but having them there with me was very helpful and they sometimes pushed me to be more assertive and to stand my ground.

I hope for you, you have people like that in the friends you have and I also hope that your family comes around to at least respecting you for who you are. I'm rooting for you ( and I'm sure there are many more on here ) on my end and remember we are always here if you need.
Your father is the one disrespecting you for being who you are, not the other way around. There is absolutely nothing disrespectful about being and presenting as yourself. If you showing up as yourself creates a scene, they're the ones creating that scene, not you. They're the ones choosing to react poorly. If they truly supported you, there would be no scene to make. Be yourself, but don't put yourself in a potentially dangerous situation.
If you think its feasible, you might want to tell your grandparents first so it's not as much of a surprise.
You need to decide if you want to keep your family in your life. If you do then go as yourself IF YOU FEEL IT’S SAFE. Your safety is top priority. If you feel that you are safe there then go and if anybody gives you any problems then you have every right to leave and not speak to them again. It’s a sucky situation but it is part of the path for some in this day which is awful but hopefully you have a support network that can help if things go bad. 

If you don’t feel safe going then I would seriously consider whether or not the pain that your family beings you is comparable to the joy. If the cons outweigh the pros then it is time to cut ties. The constant negative comments build up in you over time even if you don’t realize it.
No doubt your father will claim it is. It's not. He has, in fact, been deeply disrespectful to you by demanding that you hide your identity around him and pretend to be somebody you're not for his sake.

That said, if you're stable and safe on your own and not dependent on your parents for survival, I might recommend instead presenting him with a choice: you can come as yourself, or you can skip visiting. Make it clear to him that continuing to fake being a boy for his sake is no longer an option.
If you don't show respect, you have no right to demand respect.  

Your father doesn't respect your identity and accepts that his behavior will have a negative impact on your mental health. With your father's lack of acceptance, he worries about himself - his world view must not be shaken, his (family) environment should not connect him with a transperson etc.

It is absolutely the right decision to be yourself. You deserve this and no one should take that away from you.  It's important for mental health not to keep hiding - especially not in the place where you should feel safest and most comfortable, which is your own home. I really wish that your parents will understand this and realize that it is their job as parents to support you and not to deny you for the sake of their own convenience and reputation.

I wish you the best and a good time being yourself ♥️ be the girl you are.
Good luck! I'm sorry that your parents aren't more supportive.
I’d say not go…. Just text them or call them… something like:
“Sorry, you have the wrong number, this is ‘your name’ you called for someone ‘deadname’ never heard of them. But hey. I’m open to come over if ya want.”

Maybe I’m just mean but that’s maybe stick it to them….
You should go as you. It’s not your problem if anyone has a problem with it. 

If you are really concerned with stirring things up on the holiday have you thought about coming out to your grandparents a couple days before?

Either way you deserve to be happy and not be you because other people are ashamed, it’s their issue not yours.
I gotta say this is a difficult situation. one thing you could try is saying you’re not coming and instead maybe celebrate Easter with friends who actually treat you with the respect you deserve? or maybe call or text your grandparents before Easter to tell them that you’re trans, or only that you’ll go dressed as your true self?
Personally, I'd tell your dad ""I'll show up as me or not at all"", and end up not going given his likely reaction. But I don't think you're in the wrong to show up as yourself.
> I’ve let them deadname me and misgender me hoping that they will come around eventually.

Unfortunately, I've never seen a situation where this kinda of tactic works. People are gonna continues to do what they are comfortable or familiar with, until they are forced to change. That goes with any behavior really.  
He's not gonna change his behaviour until he is slapped in the face with the reality of the situation. I had a similar situation with my Step-mother, and i drew a line in the sand, and cut them off until they came around. Sometimes you have to really show them the alternative, Losing you from their life, to truly show them that they need to change your behaviour.

Sounds like you are coming to that point. And if you feel you can do this safely i say go for it.   
It's definitely drawing a line in the sand, saying this is me, and you either accept me as me, or you get nothing. I honestly think its the only way you might get through to your family. Which sucks, but is an unfortunate reality. 

I wish you the best of luck, and stay safe.
Tbh I just wouldn't go unless they wanted you there as you. Wanting you there as someone else isn't what a loving family does. You deserve better 💜
I came out in a similar situation, by which I mean your story sounds incredibly familiar. How to dress for family events was a fraught issue for a long time, until I finally just said screw it, I'm doing what I want.

My view on your situation is this. You have every right to show up as you. Period. This is a hard won realization for me, and I wish I had known it sooner. It sounds like you're fully aware of the potential response and are making plans to mitigate it. If you're going in with full understanding of the situation, there's no reason you shouldn't wear whatever is appropriate for you gender on a holiday like that.

In the end, I've learned that people will respond how they want to and you can't control that. But you don't owe it to anyone to pretend you're something you're not. I know in my case it just never got brought up. Literally no one has actually commented, but I come from a family who avoids conflict. God luck and I wish you the best. I'm sure you'll be beautiful! ❤️
I just wouldn't go, if they ask why, tell them you will come when they are ok with you just living as yourself.  If they can't get past their egos, she accept you for you, you are better off not being around them anyhow.
I say go. If things turn south, you got your friend there to help you out. You are absolutely NOT in the wrong for wanting to be yourself around your family and your grandparents are gonna find out eventually anyway. Make sure to keep us posted if you want do we can try to comfort or congratulate you (whichever is needed). Good luck!
>possibly “disrespect” my father by showing up in my girl clothes when he asked me not to?

Respect goes both ways. Your father is being a twat and not a good Christian
Go go go!! Be yourself. You've spent enough time lying to yourself to please other people
He’s disrespected *you* long enough. Time to turn the tables sis
No party crashing. I'd suggest reaching out to your grandparents and come out to them directly. It'll make the in person at home confrontation a little less intense.
Call your grandparents and come out over the phone, tell them that you're going to come as the real you.
Yes, ruin their Easter, fuck what your parents think.

It's totally reasonable to be you but I don't think it's the moment to come out to your grandparents. It may be that your parents already told them but I would call th or send them a message beforehand. If it's already clear your grandparents won't be supportive or at least just let you be it might be wise to not go.
Revised opinion- just don't go, cut off all contact with the scum.
i would warn you that thats probably gonna start something but it might be the move you need to make 

i went through a year and a half of pain solely trying to rebel and do what i please and it worked

i had to ignore my parents for months in misery because i had a taste of what i wanted but i couldnt do it 

u could make a statement and with a bit of distance and making sure ur safe ur dad will come around
[removed]
I think you should always just be you. I will just say that you should prepare for this to be a BIG blowup, as this is a religious holiday, for the religion that they credit for not believing you. They may see it as offensive that you chose thier holiday to come out and be yourself, so please prepare yourself and keep yourself safe.   


You might want to let your Grandparents know before they show up. This is a big emotional reveal and it could go a long way to smooth the holiday out.
Don't let anyone stop you from being you. Any decision made out of fear is a bad one.
DO IT
I don’t think it’s fair that he has tried to put who u are into a box.

I think u should be you. No matter what u should always try to be you!
Inconsiderate, well perhaps, since it would be an interesting public situation in which to out yourself to your extended family. Would I do it in your case, probably yes, but that's just me. I think the tiebreaker considerations would be, what is the potential fall out if it all goes south, and do you have a safe exit strategy if everything else falls apart.
Show up as you if you father really gave a shit about you he wouldn't pull this shit. Be yourself if they don't like it they will just not be a part of your life and that is their loss.
They’re being inconsiderate of your feelings. Quid pro quo I say. You shouldn’t have to stifle who you are to appease anyone. If it causes drama then that’s their hang up, not yours.
Honestly, if your grandparents are not a threat I will come out to them in private and ask their permission. If they support you than your father can eat sh*t.
If you feel bad for showing up as you, which you shouldn't feel bad about, text them before you come. Then you have at least ""warned"" them
If I wanted to come out to somebody, I do it privately, first. People seem to appreciate it, and those that have the mental capacity seemed honored that I trusted them and took the time for just them. Humans don’t always react well to shock and awe, but if you must do it, I hope you’re prepared for for the fallout. If I were a cousin or an Auntie you liked and got along with, I would feel hurt if you’d lumped me in with the other assholes at the gathering that knew nothing. I understand that everybody is at a different phase in transition in life, with varying needs. I hope it works out warmly for you, somehow.
I would inform your mother of your plan, and make it clear to her that it's either that or not get to have you visit for the holiday. Be polite, but absolutely firm. If they are going to keep being in your life they need to do so on your terms.

Were you still living at home and or if you are financially dependent on them the situation would be different, as keeping yourself safe (fed, roof over your head, etc...) takes precedence.
i see a lot of people saying go as you, and i agree, but i want to be brutally honest. i don’t think your family is going to react in the way you hope and i think you need to be prepared for the backlash that this could cause and you need to be prepared for them to essentially blacklist you. i don’t think there’s a world where they accept you w open arms. at least not immediately. this will take time. good luck
Show up as who you are. Your asshole dad is the one in the wrong
Personally, I’d say if at all possible come out to your grandparents beforehand, would probably be better to give them the chance to have their own reactions to it without your dad being there.
show up as you!! stay safe though <3
You could always shoot your grandparents a message and come out to them first before showing up, so you can gauge what type of reaction to expect before showing up.
How could it? Thats you. If anyone in your family has a problem with that fuck them.
Show yourself how you wanna show yourself. You have a right to be yourself in front of the people you care about/who care about you.
Do you rely on your parents for financial or other forms of support?  If so, you may want to consider the possibility of getting cut off just to prove your point.  

What harm is there letting your parents and grandparents know that you wish to join them as yourself or you will respectfully decline participation in their holiday?  

Coming out to shock the family may not be all it is cracked up to be.  I’m guessing you have better people who you can spend the day with than your birth family, if they won’t accept your true aspirations for yourself.
I avoid confrontation, so I would avoid doing this. And, especially with conservative/christians/religious people, Im terrified of them - because they can do anything they want as long as they interpret it as justifiable to 'god', which people have used for thousands of years to do awful, terrible things in the name of whatever religion.

But hey, if you think you can pull it off and have a good time, sure
I think you’re in the right but you need to be up front about your plan.  Be mater of fact.  This is who I am and how I am willing to show up.  If that’s not enough for your parents they may prefer you not come and I think you have to accept that too.  While you don’t agree with their intolerance it’s wise to respect barriers.

If you show up I think coming out to to grand parents is a given (if your presentation doesn’t out you,  maybe you could decide not to come out to them but IDK
Cis female here - whether you go as yourself this weekend or later on it’s going to happen and at least one family member is going to react poorly it seems. It’s going to emotionally hurt on some level and maybe long term. Have you thought about counseling? Not because you need it but to start speaking with a professional about all possible outcomes to interacting with your family as yourself? You can brainstorm and role play and build a tool chest for yourself for when youre in the moment. Best part of starting now is if you receive negative responses of any kind you’ve already built a report with someone and it’ll be easy to work through your emotions in the moment and not having to back track in order to move forward.

I suggest this because I have icky in-laws and I’m in counseling now preparing for how to deal with them moving forward. I love it! She’s given me amazing ideas including forming boundary lines and when to react vs walk away.

Good luck!! Also, bringing the friend is an amazing idea! Stay true to your self and having back up is setting yourself up for success!!!
I am so sorry that you are so manipulated that you think you have to abandon who you are for your dad to love you. I hope you just don't go personally, that's either self harm or putting yourself around a bunch of people who probably are heavily anti trans based on your post, but if you do, remember that it is insanely disrespectful to you for them to ask you to alter any part of yourself to go to their little get together. They disrespected you already, and waiting for them to suddenly respect you will never work, unfortunately. If you genuinely feel safe there, I hope they come around and realize you're much happier and better to be around as yourself, and if you do t I hope you don't go :)



Edit bc I'm Like This: I realized the beginning of this is. Very condescending. And that wasn't my intention lol. I just meant that it sucks that you feel the need to hide so he will be ok with you. Sry 4 projectn 😔
Maybe you could give them a call so they'd be at least... less surprised when you show up?
He doesn’t love you he loves “deadname”
Yeah sry just cut the threads and never talk to them unless they except who u are.

Its no good for anyone.
Yk what I do. I just don't respond to my deadname lol
You won't be the one being disrespectful, it's your family being disrespectful by not being more accepting of who you are
Honestly? Is having them in your life making you happy? Or is it just holding you back? It seems obvious that they're never going to respect who you are. I'd say just don't go at all. If they won't respect who you are, and are telling you to pretend to be someone you aren't, they don't deserve your respect either.
Fuck em. You’re an adult. Be yourself.
Yeah and the last time I talked to my dad he got pretty angry and said “so I guess my son is dead” which I responded “yep.” My main thing is if they might paint me to be the villain to the rest of the family. I’m not really scared of anyone being violent towards me just the emotional damage they could do
Yep, safety first. Might I suggest parking in an easy launch position so you can get in, slam on the gas and GTFOD
Haha I like the idea of carrying a smoke screen around with me for protection. Someone being mean to me? Smoke screen! Being harassed? Smoke screen! Get too embarrassed to show my face? Smoke screen! 

I definitely want to go as me.. this is just really scary and I don’t wanna lose/upset my family 😅
Alternatively hit them with torpedos and 4inch guns like destroyers
That’s really the only thing holding me back. I’m not sure if they have an idea or not I mean I haven’t done a lot to try to hide it. I dyed my hair red, I haven’t really hidden my voice since I started to practice and I’ve definitely acted more and more girly around them. They just haven’t officially been told really. I’d tell them before hand but I honestly think I’d have an easier time just showing up. I thought about calling them but to call them right before Easter Sunday? If I’m to be the talk of the day I might as well be there right? I dunno this is all so confusing and hard >.<
Eh, kindness is overrated in this situation, the father at least is a jerk and where do you think he got it from?
Thank you! <3 
And yeah honestly at this point I shouldn’t care but my heart is a bit too big and I can’t help caring about people I care about. Even if it hurts me. :’(
I’m certain I’d be in no physical harm. At worst I could have a panic attack but I have meds for that
Aww hehe thank you :)

And honestly if I go through with this I might have to accept the fact that I’ll never have a home there again. Hopefully not though! While my dad is very opinionated about it I at least have a supporting sister, and my mom MIGHT defend me if I’m lucky haha
That was kind of the idea, like just stop listening to him because it honestly might be making it worse? If he always gets his way he’ll never have to try to change for me.
Yeah :( think I might test the waters and if it goes horribly I just won’t show up anymore.
I most agree with this sentiment. If they don't want you there as yourself, it's not worth the discomfort. We give people so many chances to disrespect us and there needs to be a certain point when you just set your conditions and walk away.
I won’t be in any physical danger they aren’t violent just unsupportive
I have no interest in being edgy. I feel it would be more rude to no show. And the risk is why the pepper spray.
Already went through therapy thank you :)
I’m not sure. While I know they wouldn’t support it they’re just a bit more mellowed out in their older age so I’m not sure how they’d react. I’m just terrified I might make them cry 0_0
[removed]
Yeah unfortunately I know I have to expect it :/ honestly I would have done this on my birthday but nobody invited me to do anything on my birthday this year
I don’t think they will fully support me. They’re more the type to be quiet about a matter and then talk allll about it when who they’re talking about isn’t around
I’ve thought about this. Giving my mom a warning.. mainly because she’s sort of the middle ground between me and my father and it might benefit me to give her a heads up. Although she will probably heavily suggest against it only because she doesn’t like drama and having to deal with it. I don’t blame her I just feel bad because she’s stuck in the middle with not a clue on what to do :(
Oh Im fully expecting them to have something to say about it. Hopefully they will have enough courtesy to just ignore it and not blow up on me :)
i wish you luck my dear<3
What others think about us is beyond our control. All we can do is be ourselves so that the people that do love us as we are - can find us. 

My hair is a neon colour. Sorts out the people that will never like me real quick, and it's like a flag so that those that will like me can see & find me easily.

You are fabulous, there will be many people throughout the planet that will adore you
His son isnt dead. His son never even really existed. If he is too stuck in the past to see what hes got on his hands, he can learn what its *actually* like to lose a child. You dont need a chance, he does, and this is his chance to get things right. If he cant, it may not be worth your time to try
They start lobbing shells, pop the ""smokescreen"" and leave
If this is how they treat you- they aren't your family. They're your genetic material pool. Family is a group of people who loves and cares for each other no matter what. Best wishes comrade.
Chosen family are amazing
There are 7+ billion people on the planet, find yours 💕
5 inch actually, least on Fletchers and Gearings
I understand that this is difficult. coming out to my folks was super difficult and fortunately my parents just spread the news to other relatives themselves (in the sense of ""look what my child is doing to me!!!""). Is it possible that they already know from your parents? would make things easier
I strongly encourage you to call them about it beforehand. It’s possible that your parents have already told them but given how your dad feels about it I’d imagine that’s not something he wants to share. If at all possible, it’s better for you to come out to them directly and give them the chance to be accepting of you before they have any interaction with your parents response to it.
This is common from what I have seen, we just need to learn to be a LITTLE bit more selfish. A lot of us have grown up knowing and hiding who we are for the sake of other people to the detriment of ourselves leading to a learned but bad behaviour of putting other people's comfort above or own ( I know not everyone is like this but it's common enough and I never said everyone @saltykeyboardspambuttheadswholurkintheforums )

Just need to redefine where you are willing to compromise so that you are allowed to be happy and comfortable even if that means updating a few people along the way; you're allowed to be happy and selfish ( just not completely selfish all the time, hope this makes sense )
I wish you all the best girl 💜
That’s good. Old people can be quite empowered and unpredictable though. Tread with caution.
[deleted]
I don't know their age but my experience with the war generation is thet they are very accepting. They've seen so much shit they mostly care about happiness. I'm speaking from a western European view though. I really hope you all the best and choose yourself over everyonr❤️

Then don't mind my advice, it could be dangerous.
I think that you're a good daughter, and I totally respect not wanting to put her on the spot, but it does seem to me that it's the less risky method compared to you showing up all 'Girl Moded Up' and having your dad explode.
If you would feel worse not being there than being there and having to wear a disguise, then you can go in such a way as to 'please' your family. There will come a day soon (if not now) that that is going to likely be too unhealthy an option, but you will have to make that call. 
Quick aside, my elder son (he/they) came out 10 years ago at 17 in high school, and he moved out of his mom's house the day after he graduated because his relationship with her was so toxic. (Thankfully he and I never had those issues, though I can guarantee that neither of us expected that I'd follow suit a decade later! 😋)
Thank you <3
love the hair comment, never thought about it that way but very good thinking!
Forget the quotes, use an actual smokescreen. Throw down some smoke grenades and dissappear like they do in anime or whatever
This. Exactly this.
Your like an ad for happiness. Like those 'hot singles in your area' but real and not a virus 😂
Or 4.5 inch or 120mm or 100mm or 138mm or 130mm or 12 inch in one case
It’s possible! Honestly I think my grandparents might kinda have an idea anyways and just stay quiet about it for now. But that’s just a guess. They at least have to think I’m gay XD like anyone who doesn’t see at least that is totally in denial FOR me lol.
OP's safety matters more than gramp's levels of alive
Ah, yes. OP, be Batwoman
Hehehe!
I found my chosen family and they joy of it keeps spilling over 🤗
I hope OP can find the same. There *definitely* will be people that *chose* them too 🥰
Yeah lots of inconsistency
A destroyer with 12-inch guns?
hoping it goes well for you, best of luck ✨
[deleted]
If there is ever an option to be batwoman, be batwoman, unless you'd rather be batman or batenby.
The Soviet destroyer Engels had a 12 inch recoilless rifle installed
Bruh if gramps or the fam causes harm OP is acting in self defense. I'm not saying off the man, just that if you gotta make the spicy screen to be safe then do it. 

&#x200B;

I mean technically the better option is to not go but that seems more rude, to just no show.
Facts, tho for Batenby I'd personally just be ""The Bat""
Batenby sounds like some british royalty lord
I’m not going to pepper spray grandpa at the Easter gathering :(
Self defense typically only works in court if you’re a white heterosexual man being menaced by an intruder or by another man who is armed or otherwise much more threatening. Everyone should just cut off their transphobic families entirely ideally.
Or just ""bats"" like Joker calls Batman
""It's Da Bat!""
I'd be Batperson i think
Well I'd love to, but cutting off my family isn't cards for me right now.

&#x200B;

If Self Def don;t work then yeah just don't go OP.

Glasses are so feminizing it's incredible. I haven't gotten misgendered since I got these		"I love glasses.
This is why I don’t wear my glasses, being a trans guy. It gives me hella dysphoria. Kudos to you for using glasses to your advantage!! You look beautiful, I love your smile <3
I have been thinking of doing this too. I don't need them, but they might look good. Yours sure do!
You look so amazing and I love your glasses. You convinced me to get the same frames... You're beautiful 💕
I don’t wear glasses but I’ve thought about it for a few weeks as I keep seeing all these cute girls with glasses and just like my little nose piercing diamond, I feel it would be something I wanna do too, this has sold me
Lovely choice! It really fits you!
I am looki g forward to needing glasses.
Thanks for the tip, lol. You’re absolutely adorable btw.
Great choice, your happiness is shining through! They suit you!
Omg you remind me of a young Margot Kidder. Radiant!
How do you get them if you don't need them? Do they make ones that are just regular glass?
And here i am stuck with my big ole square masculine looking glasses
Alright well time to ruin my eyesight
I just recently realized I am trans. Seeing this gives me hope. I have a very similar facial structure.
Thank you
Thanks so much!! I definitely know cis guys who get away with glasses. Unfortunately I wasn't particularly good at being male even before I came out so I can't really give any advice. 😅
Fellow trans guy here and I wear contacts. Best decision I ever made, switching from glasses to contacts. No matter what frames they still look fem on me lmao.
Thanks! It took 30 minutes trying all the glasses in the store!! Very important!! 😆
Consider picking up some light computer glasses or maybe transitions sunglasses? I know there’s the Ray Ban evo series, not sure how you’d feel about those but the rounded ones pass as fem pretty well. That way they’ll be light indoors and you get sunglasses as well out of it, even if you don’t have a script - glasses, especially sunglasses can serve a functional purpose, please please take advantage of the uv protection modern society gives you access to, your eyes are being impacted by uv even on an overcast day
That's good news!
Thanks so much!!
It's not all good, I have to use 🤓 instead of 😀
Thank you!! ❤️❤️

Does the name Luka read more masculine or feminine to you? Be honest ❤️	"Thank you !

EDIT:

I am MTF and my birth name is Luca which in my country is STRICTLY male so I am considering wether to just change it to Luka which could be just a slight change and a bit more androgynous because changing to a hyper feminine name feels strange right now, but I haven’t started HRT so it could also be because of that. So I was thinking that even if it read more masculine it could give Hunter Schafer vibes but it obviously is weird when you introduce yourself and you dont pass yet. Like yesterday night I was at a party and had full face of make up on and with my trans sister and just based on the name i got misgendered which obviously gave me dysphoria."	"Masculine for me
As a french person it sounds masc. Maybe because of [this song](https://youtu.be/VZt7J0iaUD0)
i think it seems more masculine
Luka is a serbian or slavic strictly male name. i think it is a variation of the name ""Lucas"". Obviously if you live in the US practically every name can be considered gender neutral, but where I live if you are a woman named Luka it would be considered odd and wouldn't help you pass
Masculine, I'd say. I know a guy named that.
Masculine
I've seen it used with both. As a girl example: the vocaloid luka
It sounds feminine to me but that’s probably because of the Vocaloid.
Luka Luka Night Fever!
I don’t know I see it as both.
I think Luka is an androgynous name honestly, it's been used in many videogames by characters that are either male or female. Luka is in Chrono Trigger a game from the 90s i think and that character is female.

Its just a name that sounds very androgynous and can make people think of both male and female characters, people, etc..
Sounds in the middle to me tbh

~Alyssa
Masc imo, but I know to many guys named Luca / Luka so that's prob why
Masc for me personally
It definitely seems masc to me
Huh. I'd have genuinely thought feminine.
There's Luka Megurine the Vocaloid! She's super feminine!
Femenine for me but only because of my years of Vocaloid fangirling
masc
Luka is feminine to me. Friend of mine (who was a woman) in uni was called that.
Fem
For me its very feminine, because I know a girl named luca, but for my family it seems rather masc.
Luka has always been fem to me
androgynous
I know several men and women named Luka !
I definitely see your struggle to change the name, and I know the feeling. FtM but my name was supposedly once an all male name until some lady in the 50’s made it popular and now it’s almost solely a girls name. I haven’t had the confidence to fully come out or use a fully masculine chosen name 24/7… idk what’s holding me back so much. 

But if it’s causing you dysphoria, it might be worth getting out of your comfort zone and try out more feminine name versions. Sadly, my name won’t be perceived as nb or male, no matter what the name’s history used to be. And sadly it seems, your name won’t likely be seen as nb or female. I definitely want you to be happy and confident. But it seems the lesser of two evils, just in my opinion, would be finding relief from the impending dysphoria and misgendering.
I've known one boy called Luca and one girl called Luka so this pretty much fits with my understanding of the name.
What about the name Lucina? I don’t think it’s too hyper fem or anything and it’s much, MUCH less masculine sounding than Luka. I was also thinking Lucy could be a name if you wanted something somewhat similar. However, I think Lucy is relatively hyper feminine. I hope this helps! 💜
Fem to me. It’s like Luke is masc and Luka is fem.
For me it really doesn’t sound masculine cause of Megurine Luka, also there was a pretty famous female singer called Luca here, i think changing the C to a K is already enough to make it sound feminine but maybe it’s different depending on the country you are, just make sure you are comfortable with it and it’s fine!
I would assume masculine, but if a fem person used it I probably wouldn't think it was weird or anything.
IMHO, of the few masc leaning names ending in -a, Luka is one of them. At least where I live. Sasha, Jona, Luca, Ilya, Ezra, Nicola... The spelling doesn't change it much, although it does read slightly more feminine, I think it would sway people towards misgendering you.
pretty gender neutral honestly but slightly more masculine (i will be honest it's bc i think of Luca, the movie, first and foremost)

also i live in the US if that cultural context is important
tbh it's feminine to me because I knew a girl named Alluka, which is pretty similar.
It's masc. You could change it slightly, and keep the core but change it, for example, Lucca or Lucia.
Luka feels more like Luke and Luca feels more like Lucy. I don't know if that helps..
On one hand every name ending with ""a"" sounds feminine to me due to my native language, on the other hand it's pretty similar to Luke (probably the same name, different language, right?) I could see it being feminine and masculine depending on context
Hey! I'm FTM and for a long time I was in the fence between Luka and another variation of the name that sounded more masc to me. Eventually choose the more ""masc"" version because is a popular name in my country so I'll get less raised eyebrows with it being more ""cisnormative"", but I still like Luka a lot because it sounds a bit more andoginous to me (which I like), and also cooler. So I might be biased because I like that name a lot, but for my viewpoint Luka is a perfectly andoginous name, both for femme and masc individuals. If you like it, I'd say go for it and experiment to see if it fits? Best of luck <3
Masculine to me it's one of the most common male names where I live
Both
Sounds masc to me
Yeah, I would say masc, it's not the most masc vibe name, but still
Masc for me
Luka seems more masc to me, I’d recommend Lucy, perhaps?
Definitely masculine but only because I’m a Mavericks fan.
Masc but it could also be read as androgynous
girl do what feels good to you! who cares how it sounds if you like it go for it babe. I have always loved the name luca and for a girl it would honestly be soooo cute. it’s giving hunter schaefer vibes and i love it lol
I've seen it used both masc and fem but to me it's more reminscint of masc
i’ve only ever really heard it used in a masculine way tbh
Luka (with a k) is a generally masculine name where I live.

Edit: Looked it up and there are 3811 people marked as male with that name where I live and under 32 marked female in the name database.
I see it as a more masculine name, but that's probably cuz I know two guys called Luka and no girls
I think adding a k does make it more androgynous, not as much feminine.
Luca is the italian version to the name Luke, which is a male name

The name Luka is somewhat remembered as a ""feminine"" name because of that one singer, but that is incorrect
It's a very masc name
I think it sounds cute and androgynous personally!
I have a swedish friend named Luka who's male, so I'm biased to say masc
It sounds more androgynous than with a c, I think if you don't want to be hyper feminine yet then it's a good choice ^^
Andro, more femme than Tyler, but slightly more masc than Alex
It sounds masculine to my francophone ears. The female equivalent would be Lucia or Lucie
Masculine
Honestly just very androgynous, I think I actually know equal amounts of boys, girls AND enbys with this name
Luca seems more feminine to me than Luka . But you’ve lived with Luca and probably associated it with people addressing you as Luca and a boy

Edit; typo
more masc for me, why don’t you try lucia? i think it’s rlly pretty
Feminine or androgynous
[deleted]
I think it SOUNDS more masculine but if I met a girl name luka I wouldn’t question it I thinks it’s cool.
I've had it used in both feminine and masculine contexts so it's neutral
Dutch person here, sounds masculine to me. hope that helps!
Andro to me
Masculine as well. You could try Lucy/Luci?
I'm amab and my name is Luka. But in Germany where I live I legally have to have a second name that is clearly gendered. So at least officially Luka is a gender neutral name at least where I live. But I have never actually seen a woman with the name Luka but I wouldn't be surprised if I met one.
It's a boys name in every use I've heard it. But I'm sure you could swing either way.
i see it as feminine mainly because of Megurine Luka (vocaloid) and i see Luca as more masc
Okay so for me Luka is female, but Luca is def male   


I only know women with a k and only men with a c ... which is super weird because I guess in my language most people will assume it's a c and thus male ... thinking of it ... I think I only know trans women who are named Luka ...  


Like I read Luka and thought 100% female, male didn't even cross my mind until I read your edit and realised it's close to Luca  
Interesting indeed ... never thought about it
Masculine
Masc for me.
Depending on how you write it Luka a bit more masc,
Luca is more feminine
Kinda reminds me on the name Laika, so I was thinking fem
I see it as masculine. I also immediately think of Final Fantasy X when I hear that name lol
It's masculine to me.
Gender neutral to me
I assumed it was a feminine name, but I feel like the movie Luca will probably make a lot of people think of it as masc. Idk I've never seen my dead name or chosen name in media so I don't know how annoying that could be.
I always thought it was a girls name, despite the fact that I have an Italian friend whose name is Luca.
As someone from a slavic country, I've only ever heard that name used for males, so to me that is a distinctly masculine name.
i probably would've thought it was only feminine but after the disney movie Luca it also sounds masculine i guess, idk it feels like a pretty gender neutral name
I know someone who is non-binary and they changed there name to Luca. So maybe it's kinda neutral. Also I'm sure my Luca is about to transition to female. So there's that as well.
Either way it's a really nice name.
It definitely is more masculine in society, but a friend I knew from high school named her *daughter* Luca! So gender norms be damned!
Masculine
Only Luca I know is a girl so yeah
As a portuguese native speaker sounds masculine, but it depends of where you live
I always have the nickname Nate, when I'm transitioning, to don't cause much trouble with presenting myself I changed slightly my nick name to Naty, that sounds more feminine, my little tip to you, if you want to change but don't be hyper feminine on your name, use the nickname Lu, that can be a short for so many androginous, masculine or feminine names that no one will know or judge
It's more gender neutral, in my opinion. I mean, if you gave the name to a boy it would do the same as If you gave it to a girl. If you think it fits you personally, I don't see a problem with having the name

Besides, who's going to give you shit for having a name, a transphobe? What do they know, not science that's for sure.
Masc
Lucia? Is not hyper femme? Or luci (short for lucifer? Cuz ik many  enby/trans peeps who pick..edgy? Weird but in a good way? names as they transition)
I assumed fem but I guess that's the language difference.
My best friend is named Luka and she‘s very feminine to me :D
masculine
Masc
I know a girl named Luca and a guy named Luka, so I personality see Luca as more feminine and Luka as more masculine, but ig it just depends on the place 🤷
Masc af.
With a K= male (more similar to Luke)

With a C= female (more similar to Lucy)
One of my friends went from Luca to Lyka, tho cuz she used Luca for a while anyway it's ingrained as fem in my brain now lol
Masc
I strongly associate it as being feminine, because of Megurine Luka and because it ends in -a.
I see it as neutral. But Lucca with 2 Cs will 100% make me think of the character from chrono trigger every time.
Masculine
Male. My friend recently had a boy and named him Luca!
Masc
a more feminine male name if that makes sense
Femme to me
sounds fem to me tbh
US here, never heard that name before, and honestly it seems pretty androgynous to me, like 50/50... only similar comparison I know is Luke
In Europe, it's definitely a masculine name
Very masc, could be feminine but far more masc than fem in my opinion
Feminine for me but it is androgynous
Masculine
Masc, luka is a masculine name in finland
I changed my name from rick to Rikki and while I  did it because it made it easier for a lot of reasons I think it contributed to misgendering from people who new me before transitioning. In hindsight I wish I had gone with something different to change the association.
It does sound masculine to me also.
Masculine, mostly because it’s my uncles nickname (his name is Gianluca)
I know that Luka is usually more masculine but I honestly feel like it could be either masculine or feminine
To me as an American it sounds kinda gender neutral but I’d perceive Lucia or Lucy as a lot more femme personally
Masc for me
Reads femme to me idk something about the “k”
I would never hear the name Luca and think of a girl
to me specifically it seems more feminine, that might just be cause i have a female friend named Luka, but i do think it depends on what area your in for how people perceive it
Seams male to me
sounds more masc imo, but if you didn't want much change, lucia is an option? although that is a bit more feminine than androgynous if that's currently an issue
More gender neutral tbh
I'm American and before reading these comments I assumed it was the feminine version of Luke.
Luka looks masculine, but where are you from?
it does seem a bit masculine to me, but i’m kinda seeing some feminine side to the name as well
Masculine
I would hear/read that as a masculine name. Maybe you could go with a feminine variation like Lucia or Lucretia.
American - sounds androgynous
wierdly it feels androynous to me...
as a Spanish I attribute it to a masculine name but I think it would fit beautifully to a woman too
Doesn’t sound like a gendered name to me.
Luka reads as being on the feminine side to me personally. Luca feels more masculine. Though tbh they both seem a bit androgynous
I've always seen it as more fem, but looking at the other comments it seems like I'm in the minority.
Everyone's saying masc but I say fem, I grew up with a girl named Luka (whether it was spelled that or 'Luca' I don't actually know).
masc
I think its pretty androgynous
I think it's androgynous
Masc because my birthname is luca with a s
Bc of stein's gate ive always read it as feminine
Masc
Masc because of luka magnotta tbh
It think that Luka is a masc name
I’d read it masc.
Ironically with the K more than with C, as the C could be short for Lucia?
Androgynous, personally, but if I had to choose I'd say Masc
Were i live its a gender neutral name like Alex for exemple (trough to me it was always more femenin for me. well untill the movie Luca came out..)
Feminine to me, but that’s cause the only Luka I know is AFAB NB and femme presenting
I’m from the US but when I first heard it I thought femme
I know a man named Luka but it sounds fem
Depending on the country your from, going from Luca to Lucia can in many languages be be leaning to male or female depending on pronunciation.
Have you ever considered the name Harper? It's more often a girl's name but it isn't uncommon to see people of any gender with it.
I usually read it as masculine myself, just because it makes me think of Luka Couffaine from Miraculous Ladybug (and honestly, he's a pretty androgynous leaning male character: definitely gives me andro and bi vibes). I do think that Luka could potentially be used in a more feminine/androgynous way (much like Charlie is, or Hayden). 

In the end though, I think it matters more to how the name makes you feel c: if you like it, and it makes you happy, then go for it. Try it out for a bit, see how it goes c: there is nothing wrong with you changing it later; there is not obligation to stick with the first name you use when transitioning. I know I went through several names before landing on the one I have now Cx
To me it reads as masculine still. Only feminine thing I thought of was Megurine Luka the vocaloid lmao
Luka sounds more masculine to me. (sorry)
Masculine
Definitely masculine
Luka is definitely masc. maybe lucoa like the dragon from miss Kobayashis dragon maid. She’s really cute 😭
Masculine 100% i would say
Welllllll since my god character is an all sex all gender creature, being made from stars and born from a spectacle of cosmic mating, named Lucanyct, I find it very gender neutral. 

Since there's this movie named Luca, people may associate it with slight more masculinity but, eh, his roundness isn't something hardcore masculine heh. 

The only Luka I actual remember, is from Miraculous, and, well, eh, I mean, he's a man but, nyeh, name doesn't really scream boyman at me. 

So, I see Luka and Luca as gender neutral. 
Btw are these the same name just different spellings or?
my dumb ass hears the name luka and immediately thinks of luka megurine
i personally think the name is feminine, but probably because that character is super feminine
A more androgynous or feminine version of luke
Lucia
As a canadian it's completely gender neutral. I know two girls named Luca, and one boy named luka with a k, so to me at least it's more feminine but overall gender neutral
definitely masc, sorry sweetheart
It’s more like luka can be both
I personally think that this name sounds more masculine
I think it's similar to Lukas which is a masc name so i think it leans in the same way
[deleted]
Feminine to me
I love the vocaloid Luka, and despite actually liking the name as someone ftm I couldn’t use it because it feels too feminine to me. I honestly think it’s gender neutral, leans masc or fem by how you spell it
Femme
Luka with a k feels more masc
Masculine, I personally think hanging your name to Lucy would be more fitting, but it's up to you!
I’m Italian so Luca (with the C) is a masculine name, but Luka (with the K) I don’t really know (and yes I read the edit after lmao)
I only know the name Luka from the cis masc character on ER from the early 2000s, but I’m old, so idk how most ppl would hear it today.
Makes me thing of the (female) vocaloid Luka.
I know a couple of females called Luka, but it is a more male name.
luka is actually a word that means hand/arm in a language I speak, I'm incapable of assigning a gender to it :(
Luka could go either way for me. On a woman it comes off as a “cool tomboyish name,” but not strictly male or misgendering.
More feminine def
The only Luka I know is a cis woman from a lab I used to work at!
Wait I thought this song was about a girl named Luka 😂😂
I was so scared of it being a rickroll
Bonjour. Vive la France. Vive le général. *grand sourire* Au revoir.
Yes great example
This was where my head was at, I've never met anyone with this name but the girl in Crono Trigger had a similar, or phonetically identical name, though I'm pretty sure it was spelt Lucca.

Okay that’s what I was saying, Luka sounds so beautiful and androgynous to me
Same
Thank you for this heartfelt answer ❤️❤️❤️ I will think it through and really consider it. Thank you x1000000
Thank you for the suggestions ❤️❤️
Thank you angel ❤️
Feel like its also more femme than Blake imo
True ❤️
Thank you ❤️
Italy ❤️
Hahaahhaah
The problem with these passing names is that yes they do the job but they are kind of… boring, i cant explain it. They arent exciting to me. For me an androgynous name is more exciting something like… Grey or Hunter or Blake for a girl is way way more cool and exciting yk
Lol
[Luka (song) [wikipedia]](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luka_(song))

*«few years ago, I used to see this group of children playing in front of my building, and there was one of them, whose name was Luka, who seemed a little bit distinctive from the other children. I always remembered his name, and I always remembered his face, and I didn't know much about him, but he just seemed set apart from these other children that I would see playing. And his character is what I based the song Luka on. In the song, the boy Luka is an abused child—in real life I don't think he was. I think he was just different.»*
Same. Never saw the video before now. So to me Luka was always a feminine name.
Hey miss chapeau!
>the girl in Crono Trigger had a similar, or phonetically identical name, though I'm pretty sure it was spelt Lucca.

Yeah, I thought of her too. It's also spelled Lucca in the sequel, so I'm pretty sure that's the official spelling.

That version feels more feminine to me than with the ""k,"" but I'm not sure if that's just because of the games.
It is spelled Lucca in Chrono Trigger, but there was a female character named Luka in Secret of Mana as well.
Yeah, lucca is how i believe its spelled or maybe it depends on the version you play because I think i've seen it worded both ways in CT 🤔

Whether its spelled Luka or Lucca, either iteration sounds and looks androgynous to me.
thanks!
I agree with Hawaian shirts guy, if your name gets you misgendered now, it's probably worth changing. Are you from Italy (here Luca is masc)?

I chose my name in part bc I associated it with a girl who isn't incredibly feminine (contrast with names from flowers). I wanted a name that was ""feminine but not girly"", if that makes sense. Maybe you could do the same. Keep spinning, girl :)
Anytime. xx
Its a pretty name
ANCHE IO
Good luck to you
Thanks for this. 😁
while the name came from her own experience, part of the reason she kept the name was that it could be the name of a boy or a girl, so it was more ""universal""

and yes, until i saw the video, i thought it was a girl's name too

interestingly, watching the video now, with the parts where her face seems to go back and forth in time... and how she acts out the pain, its almost as if Luka was her as a child... almost makes it like a trans story
Yes im from Italy ❤️
Sicilia?
Beccata!

All'inizio, quando pensavo ai nomi, Viola suonava bene. Ma mi dava... come dire, l'immagine di una femminilità troppo vestitino e sala da ballo. Invece Sofia mi faceva pensare a una bibliotecaria vestita sobria e occhialuta (come me). Naturalmente, le persone che conosciamo influenzano la nostra visione dei nomi. Ti confesso che fa ancora strano chiamarmi con un nome femminile, ma usarlo online aiuta molto a normalizzarlo (anche se non sono ancora certa sia il nome giusto).
SI!
Concordo totalmente!! Buffo perchè se fossi nata femmina i miei mi avrebbero chiamata Sofia! Ma personalmente a me i nomi troppo tradizionali italiani non mi piacciono in generale, ho bisogno di qualcosa con un po di edge. Il mio look è molto hyper-fem e vorrei che il mio nome fosse più androgino, ricercato
Una delle mie migliori amiche è di Palermo
Già, purtroppo i nomi neutri in italiano sono pochi, quindi bisogna cercare fuori. [Questa](https://www.nomix.it/nomi-unisex.php) è una lista carina di nomi androgini (alcuni non funzionano, tipo Simone sarà ambiguo in inglese ma in italiano è decisamente maschile). Personalmente trovo che i nomi della mitologia celtica e anglosassone siano carini, soprattutto Morgan e Mildred (forse i miei nomi nb preferiti). Poi, ovviamente, c'è [Tiamat](https://www.reddit.com/r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns/comments/s3lqxm/it_gets_better/) ;)

Can I be trans without massive mental problems?	"hey \^\^

***I have the following problem after my last therapy session:***

My therapist doesn't wanna write my indication letter *(I'm from Germany, so I need this to legally get on hrt)* herself but rather wants me to get a second opinion by another therapist. As a reason she stated that my problem wasn't that of other trans people she had as patients and that she's unsure I'm even trans and not just a feminine guy.

Her usual patients are apparently very mentally unstable and can't keep a job or anything because of mental problems and I seem to be fine. I got a good job, moved into a new flat and got a fairly healthy social life. I have some dysphoria but it's not a life controlling amount, some days I can't get anything done because of it but most days I'm fine.

***She also said that I seem to have more of a social problem rather than the usual body problem.***

I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and chest area, according to my friends I can pass pretty well with makeup, fake boobs and tucking. I've been voice training for about a half a year now and my voice is not that far away from passing too. I seem to have naturally low testosterone so I got pretty lucky with genetics here.

I get massive dysphoria though when I go through the trouble of doing my makeup, finding clothes that look good on me, styling my wig and then still getting misgendered and deadnamed by my friends. It isn't as bad when I'm boymoding.

So did I just get lucky with my genetics or am I faking being trans because that's more socially accepted than feminine boys?"	"A cardinal rule of appropriate therapy is that the therapist not insist on their interpretation of reality versus the patient. That is improper use of clinical authority. Your therapist is bullying you into questioning reality: this is gaslighting. Terminate the relationship. Also, remember, therapists can have anxiety too. **A practitioner's own anxiety is usually the root of a refused letter, not a conviction about you or the truthfulness of your trans identity.** You are welcome to ask your therapist: ""I am confused. What is the threat that is preventing you from writing this letter for me?"" (ask in a calm, curious, playful, and polite tone and politely excuse yourself from the exchange if you feel yourself growing angry or losing control or if she starts gaslighting you: ""Thank you for the information/your opinion"" is a good stock response, and you can repeat it until she backs down). **Do not apologize or say sorry during this exchange!** See what she says and how she reacts! This person is a paid service provider, not an unquestionable god and if she can't handle that question skillfully then...ummmm...not to be reductionist but she may be a suboptimal or substandard therapist. I have met many professionals who are doctoral level (PsyD, PhD, MD) who are suboptimal, especially behind closed doors. **Do not blame yourself or start questioning yourself, people are generally self-motivated.** Good luck!
Hey there! Im so sorry, you should definetly seek another therapist because your current one is heavily transphobic.

An Indikation for hormones in germany can be issued in the first session, there are no requirements. Among therapists who actually know their stuff its more of a formality than anything else, YOU decide whether or not your trans and what you want to do with your body
You don't need dysphoria or to want to change your body to be trans, your therapist is very ignorant. A feminine boy will still want to be a boy, usually with strong certainty
there are a lot of us in stable jobs, in good living conditions :) 

&#x200B;

change your therapist.

&#x200B;

(Plus the indikation letter is not a legal thing, more a thing, that doctors want to be save for regress, technically all doctors can prescribe HRT on private base (except dentists))
Why be a feminine boy unless you WANTto be one? If you were marooned on an island  with only you for ever,  what would you like to be?
Nah, you're trans if you want to be.

Gender is arbitrary, there is no medical approach that'll work 100% of the time. The fact that you would seek out HRT in the first place or even try to pass as a woman ever is good enough reason for me to believe you're trans.
So, people are very complex, and a therapist should understand that. Its certianly not uncommon for trans people to have mental health issues, however it is not necessarily a requirement, and the severity levels vary. I myself am trans, and have some pretty complicated mental health issues, but I go to school, in the summer I keep a job, and while I struggle to do these things and go about daily life, I find myself having the ability to still do them. In a similar vein, therapists have doubted my depression because of the reasons I have listed. 

But people do not fit into models, and while these models can be useful for diagnosis purposes, they should never be absolute. You and your journey is valid, no matter what. However that does not help much in your situation. I don't know much about German trans laws, but I do know that getting a second therapists opinion has been nothing but beneficial to me for other mental health reasons.
Yes you can. If your therapist thinks you need serious mental problems in order to be trans, you should get a new one.
Wait, what? Do you have to be mentally ill to be trans? That sounds a little transfobic, in my opinion.
That’s ridiculous. If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself! Not something that a doctor tells you. I also know many people here in America who have or had terrible dysphoria, body and social, who were able to keep a brave face and be functional despite their struggle. It’s absurd to say that you can’t be trans because your life hasn’t been torn apart.
Yeah you can be trans without massive mental problems.

To be fair I didn’t think I had problems until I started peeling away maladaptive coping mechanisms…
Not all trans people are going to experience being trans the same way. If a therapist doesn’t understand that they should not be involved in gender affirming care.
There is no set requirement to be anyone. Be the person you want to be. It’s unfortunate that most people can’t be who they are, but don’t tear yourself down. Build yourself up and help others build their own confidence as we all need someone who is willing to reassure the truth. You matter, you’re a beautiful person, and you’re supported in this lovely community. Live by the sage words of Mister Rogers “won’t you be my neighbor?”
Yes. Most mental issues that trans people experience are tied to their experience with how others treat them in base of how they perceive them.
wow thats just, straight up terrible transphobia... wow
Sounds like your therapist is just a little ignorant. Yes, you can be trans without massive mental problems. In fact most of the time they prefer you to be some measure of mentally stable when you start HRT.
I wonder how many more years this fucking gatekeeper mentality will be in place. I think anyone that can show they are mentally stable and properly informed as they make the decision to change their gender it should be allowed to receive care affirming their desired gender. It's sad that this therapist seems to indicate you have to be on the brink of suicide or unable to conduct day-to-day life unless you had affirming care in order to move forward. All that does is put stress on people that happen to be fortunate enough to be managing OK (for the time being) until they are able to begin gender affirming steps.
I'm in America so not sure if this is super helpful, but the APA specifically recommends against the kind of gatekeeping your therapist is doing. This is called transmedicalism and the quote from the APA speaking against this ideology is,""TGNC identities can be healthy and self-affirming and are not inherently pathological"". Gender dysphoria is a pathology and is therefore not inherent to being transgender.
This is bull:
She still follow the Benjamin scall that is outdated on scientific publications.

For an history on trans classification:

[here](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en)

(I know it take the DSM as an example (damn AmeriKan) but the international science consensus go in the same way).

To be simple: you don't have to be textbook dysphoric to be trans, mild or no symptoms are enough if you identify differently as your AGAB: you are trans, period.
not all trans people are the same. your therapist cannot hold a view of ""all trans people are unstable because they are trans"" because it is not true.

edit: typo
Es tut mir mega Leid für dich. Ein Tip hätte ich da für dich selbst ""nicht spezialisierte"" Therapeuten können dir eine Indikation ausschreiben lassen. Das habe ich bei meiner damaligen Therepeuten gefragt ""für einen Freund"". Vorallem in einem Umkreis von 100km müssten welche da sein. (Aber guck das sie dementsprechend nicht konservativ eingestellt sind bzgl deiner Indentität)
Ich selber bin erst am 1. Schritt ein Überweisung zu bekommen von meinem HA für einen Psychotherapeuten. Und ich hab auch diese Angst die du teilst nicht eine Indikation zu bekommen und das noch länger hinauszuzögern. 

Ps. I saved this post and Ill translate it later because Im not at Home right now
I’m just gonna say trust your gut, it knows you better than yourself. I don’t have any serious mental illness and I started my HRT while graduating from university and I landed a great job. My point is that being trans is not related to sever mental Illness and being a failure and unemployed. Follow your gut, you won’t be disappointed!
You absolutely can. I am so sick of this medical gatekeeping. Someone needs to tell these doctors that it's not the 70s any more. 

There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. It's transphobic bullshit. People aren't emotionally unhealthy because they're trans, they're emotionally unhealthy because the world treats them like garbage for being trans. The more trans people receive support from society at large, the fewer traumatized trans people there will be. 

Your doctor is working from outdated information, and clearly has some biases to overcome if they're going to be treating trans patients. If they wait for dysphoria to destroy your life before they offer treatment, then what's the point of the damn treatment? You have dysphoria. That's enough. 

As to whether you might just be a feminine guy,

         ""I'm okay with my body apart from my crotch and.          
         chest area""

 If you were just a feminine guy, you probably wouldn't feel that way. 

I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed. 

Good luck! 💕
Your therapist is a dummkopf. Get estradiol and spiro from the internet.
She is transphobic and gatekeeping.

She doesn't have your best interest at heart, she wants you to be so distressed by dysphoria that you can't function in the world, before she will say that you are trans.

She got into her line of work to hurt people and keep functioning trans people from being able to access appropriate medical care.
I had a similar situation to you. I got 2 therapists, worked out great in the long run. I think you’re trans. And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something? Or she’s just stubborn
This whole ""more socially accepted than feminine boys"" angle is pure fucking cancer. Neither is socially accepted to any extent that makes ""more"" or ""less"" carry any weight, and it's literally always people who are gonna hate you either way saying, ""I'd rather call you a f____t than a t____y""

Doesn't really help your situation but this is what goes through my head every time I have this ""alternative"" presented to me by ""well-meaning but critical"" people. It's just not even close to a valid argument and if I heard it from a therapist I'd be reporting her ass to the oversight board for wasting my precious therapy time.
I had a good job and a nice car and had my shit together when I transitioned. The correlation between trans and being unstable seems kinda bigoted.
You dont need dysphoria or some kind of trauma. As long as you have a genuine want to be a gender other than your originally assigned one your trans
Hi I also live in Germany. I moved to Germany last year and I started therapy as soon as I had insurance.
I also have no mental health issues at all. I’ve never been depressed or had any anxiety or other common mental health issues allot of trans people experience.
My therapist had no problem writing my indication, I think you should just look for a different therapist.
Also if you just want to get a “Gutachten” done anyways, it will be beneficial for your “Namens- und Personenstandsänderung” if you plan on doing that. You are required to have 2 of those. I know they are currently talking about changing it to where you don’t need them anymore, but it will probably take a while for it to pass.
If by chance we live in the same area, I could give you my therapist’s information. 
Also if you are wanting to start HRT it sounds to me that you are sure about you being transgender. You should never have to “prove” to you therapist that you are trans, that’s just wrong on so many levels.
One of the biggest differences between something that is and isn’t a mental disorder in the DSM, is that the condition must cause distress and persist more than six weeks I believe.

Let’s reframe this through the lens of homosexuality. Someone who likes the same sex and doesn’t struggle wouldn’t have a disorder but would still be gay. Another person who likes the same sex but struggles massively with it because of societal values possibly would have a disorder. Both people are still gay, Just as two trans people one who struggles and one who doesn’t are both still trans. 

Its up to you to decide if your truly trans and if transitioning is a journey you want to go on :) hell i would even argue that your would still be trans and valid even if you never transitioned.
Yeah, crippling inability to function is definately not a requirement to be trans.

We're people like anybody else.
Don't question who you are because others don't want to accept you ❤️
Actually sometimes its the other way around, and they wont recoginize your transness bc you have other issues and they think that maybe they are causing your bad feelings. I feel like you cant win if someone else gets to decide if your trans or not.
That therapy is supposed to be assessing you for gender dysphoria which as a trans person you do have so that is very strange. Is it possible for you to get a second opinion from a different therapist?
Yes, you can. Get a new therapist.
I've struggled a lot in my life and being trans is only a small fraction of that struggle. I have ADHD, bipolar, massive amounts trauma and PTSD, anxiety, etc. Since transitioning my social anxiety and general discomfort with myself and my body have all but disappeared. It didn't magically erase everything, but it made dealing with the other shit much more manageable.

Transitioning should always be measured by how you feel about yourself after rather than how you feel before. If that doctor looked at me she may think I'm not really trans because I no longer hate myself and I'm much laxer with my identity and pronouns than I was when I first transitioned. In reality I've just reached a point where I hardly think about being trans anymore, and if I do it's not as this unbearable medical condition.

Now it's pretty much just one my traits. Y'know, _I like pizza, coffee, and I'm trans._ Honestly I wish I'd felt that way from the start. Being trans doesn't need to be debilitating for you to want to transition.
I am trans and I don’t have any mental illnesses
I’m like you where I don’t have very many mental problems and i can totally handle myself, but trust me, I am definitely trans.
Yes.

Source: me. It's a noted overlap (though I suspect this is in part trans peoples' willingness to self-examine and see mental issues as well) but there's no requirement.
Dysphoria is different for everyone some people don't even realize they have it as they have other issues that need adressed as well, such as depression and anxiety that may have been caused by dysphoria or may not be.

So the awnser is yes. If you plan to start hrt you should definitely think it over though, decide if you want to do this and if you turn out to be wrong, do you feel you could handle it.
I think getting a second opinion is the best thing to do. Therapists are just people too so maybe shes not sure what's the right thing to do in your case.
Ok, so I’m from Germany myself and no you don’t need to be a complete mental wreck to be trans, of course.
You seem to have a fair amount of problems/dysphoria regardless and it is, even though others might be worse of than you, still not something to be overlooked.
I’m fairly new to all of this (about 1,5 years now) but I experienced something similar with a Klinik I went to.
So I went there because I also have my fair share of mental problems and they didn’t really accept me as trans because apparently I didn’t conformed to the guidelines they have(?).
So maybe it’s that, again I’m not that far yet and haven’t been at the point of getting an indication letter.
It sucks though, only because you feel better than the other patients that you get written of as “not trans” even though you have dysphoria, at least from what I can gather, and when you ask yourself if you’re faking something you most likely aren’t.
So, I know this wasn’t that helpful, but I hope I could help a little bit.
The therapist problem is made worse by the fact that a lot of trans people fear being prevented from transitioning, and tailor the experiences they share with therapists in order to get through the gatekeeping process. So when someone like you comes by, who is very much within the typical variation of experience that trans people have, but doesn't try to conform, they can get worried.
So i went without help for my mental health issues for way to long because i had good grades and was doing okay. I finally got help after completely breaking down and being suicidal for 2 years. After getting help i realized how much i was suffering before.

I am doing so much better now and that is what allowed me to realize that i am a trans men. I could survive living as a women somehow but i learned form my last experience.**You don´t need to suffer in order to earn your identity or to prove you actually have a problem.** I knew i was not fine before my environment knew and i should have trusted myself to know myself better than other people.

I think everyone is different and you seem to have some advantages that her other patients might not have had like an supportive friends.

Also when my parents misgendered me before coming out it was okay but afterwards it made me feel horrible. Luckily they have adjusted by now and use my new name and pronouns.

Also faking is something you do on purpose and you know when you do it. You could be wrong about your identity, but that is something you know better than anyone else. Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?
It’s time to be forward to your therapist.Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy and this will be the last session unless they write you a letter for hrt. “ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”
She's sadly a bit uninformed. There's ALL kinda of ways to be trans. Some doesn't function at at all, while some function very well. Your therapist SHOULD know this. It's like someone says ""all people with autism is the same way"". Simply NO.
See, this is \*exactly\* the problem with treating gender dysphoria as a mental disease.

Apparently, you're not ""crazy"" enough to warrant therapy, never mind what \*you\* want.

But what if you were a cis woman, and didn't feel woman enough because, in your opinion, your breasts are too small? Then no one would argue ""Well, see, your breasts aren't small enough to warrant surgery"". No one would say ""Nope, no breast augmentation for you, you look fine! You're so pretty already!"".

Or what if you're a man and are balding and feel less of a man because of that? No one would say, ""See, you're not bald enough to get treatment"". No one would stop you from getting hair implants.

Or suppose you're a man and had a problem getting erections. Would anyone say ""Sure, but do you really need them anyway? You're not married and don't have a girlfriend, so why do you want erections?"" and bar you from getting Viagra?

So why is it OK for a doctor to go ""I don't think you're suffering enough, so I'm going to withhold treatment from you"" when you're trans?

So yeah, find another doctor, ASAP.
Weird the therapist knows what's wrong with your body than you do

How did they get that technology?

Are they gods?

 There are some people that shouldn't be medical professionals because they refuse to listen to the patients and think they know what's best without listening to what the problem is

Find a new therapist
Maybe it’s better to think of socially and medically transitioning as a choice one makes rather than a fixed “identity” ie something you “are” or “aren’t”. I would be deeply skeptical of those who tell you your therapist is bad for you for not encouraging transition. A therapist is there to help you determine what is true for you and decide with you what the best course of action for supporting your health. Transition isn’t “free”. There are social, mental, physical risks and costs associated with it and it’s NOT a panacea for your suffering. It makes sense for a therapist to help you turn over every stone in your psyche before encouraging transition. Be understanding of that. Beware of those telling you what to do or how to think because they’re trying to justify how they’re living their lives.
Yall are giving OP good advice and stuff and im just sitting here like 'Well that son of a dick face people can be metally stable""
My therapist specializes on trans people and she was the only one in a 100km radius from me that didn't have a year or longer waiting time.

I had my first session about a year ago while I was still questioning, so I got there in order to find out if I'm trans. Maybe she still has that image of my in her head instead of my current self.

She said I needed to do 12 therapy sessions and get the indication letter otherwise the endocrinologist will be able to deny me hrt.
From what i heard it usually takes 6 months to get the indication.

But i agree this therapist does not seem to be good. Her arguments reminds of the things people with adhd hear when they have good grades or can keep a job. It is weird how some therapist don´t realize that not everyone has to be exactly the same.
This might seem a bit self serving I'm sorry, but I'm also German and have genuinely no clue where and how to get to hrt, should I look for therapists 'specialized' in lgbt problems, does any therapist theoreticaly work? I looked some stuff up but couldn't really find what I'm looking for ;-;
Anyways, have a great day :)
I'm not really in a position where I can change my therapist without waiting another one or two years for hrt because the waiting times for therapists here are a year at minimum.

She said I needed 12 therapy sessions and the indication letter or the endocrinologist could deny me from getting hrt.
>Why be a feminine boy unless you WANT to be one?

I don't know, because my therapist says she sees me more as a femboy than a girl.

>If you were marooned on an island with only you for ever, what would you like to be?

A girl.
The problem with getting a second therapists opinion is that the spaces for therapists to be able to get paid by insurance companies is limited and the number of spaces haven't been changed in like 15 years.

So almost everyone looking for therapy has to wait a year or longer to get accepted by the limited number of therapists who can accept insurance parents.
Not her exact wording, but it was kind of what my therapist meant when comparing me to other patients of hers while doubting my transness
>If you yourself are concerned about actually being trans that’s one thing that you should be checking out Yourself!

I was when I started the therapy a year ago. Right now tho I'm pretty sure that this is the right way for me.
I mean I have dysphoria, I'm just very good at hiding it and staying sane at the same time.

But I wonder how long I can keep this up..
Maybe I've overreacted a little in the title  
Her exact wording was more like ""You seem fine in life, usually my patients have other problems next to being trans, you seem to have more of a social problem than one with your body, so I'm not sure and I'd like to get a second opinion""
>There's this narrative that only the deeply broken would be trans; only someone profoundly warped in the mind would choose this horrific life. 

From what I've heard from my therapist it's not a thought up narrative of hers but her experience with trans people so far, and she's specialized on gender identity problems

>I'm sorry this antiquated nonsense is standing in your way. Hopefully your second opinion will be less hidebound and you can get that letter signed.

thanks \^-\^   
I'm mostly scared that the second opinion will also deem me not trans and I'll have to go through yearlong waiting times for hrt while testosterone keeps on destroying my body.
Uhm, where would I get that?

Don't I still need to get my hormonal values monitored by a medical professional for my own safety?

And don't I have to do one year of ""official hrt"" to be eligible for srs?
>And your therapist could just be new and inexperienced or something?

She's supposed to be specialized on gender problems. 

My guess is that she's unsure because I've been with her for a year and I started therapy when I was still just questioning.
If only I could relay that want to my therapist.
Sometimes I feel like you can never win, like ever.

But yea our current system is pretty shit
I'm currently trying to but waiting lists are long in Germany.
>Is being feminine the only thing you care about when it comes to being trans? Would you be fine with your agab if you could be feminine?

I wanna be feminine, I wanna be treated like a girl by others, I wanna be called by a feminine name and she/her pronouns, I want my penis gone, I wanna have boobs of my own, I want basically every side effect hrt would give me (less muscles, softer skin, more emotions).
>Tell them you find it insulting that they called you a femboy

She didn't call me a femboy straightforward it was more like ""I think you might be more comfortable as a feminine guy rather than a trans woman""

>“ you’ve wasted my money and my time that I could have actually used to get real help for my gender dysphoria”

Atleast it was free for me because of insurance. But I won't be able to ever get the time back.
I mean just because someone ""specializes"" sadly doesn't make them trans friendly. Its so sad that there are so few spots and the wait times are so long.

The fact that she is lying to your face is what worries me. The endocrinologist will not deny your indication with 1 or 100 sessions, they barely look at the thing. I know that since I got my indication after 30 minutes in my first session. I also know that since I study psychology and work towards becoming a gender therapist myself. The indikation can be issued by everybody without any requirements, it basically just says: ""Ey yo im a therapist and this person is trans"". And clearly your therapist doesn't think youre trans, which makes her uber transphobic. It doesn't matter what she thinks, this is just about how you feel

Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful
Yea, I think we now know why she was the only one in a 100km radius who doesn't have a lot of patients. 

Saying you have to have an inability to keep a job to be trans is just ... insane.
>100km

Have you had any luck outside that radius? Seems like a pretty restrictive distance, although I admit being from a semi-rural area of USA may skew my sense of distance a bit.
Darf ich fragen, wo du bist? UKM, also Münster oder wo anders? Denn es gibt echt recht viele Therapeuten die sich darauf spezialisieren und nicht nur von den Unikliniken sind.
Yes that is true, but that is not because of some medical or legal precedent. There is no requirement for an indication, and if your therapist refuses to give you one its not because they can't, its because they dont want to. 

And the reason they don't want to usually is because they have some old, transphobic views and simply don't believe their patient is trans when they tell them they are. Just like OPs therapist, whose even lying directly into their face
hey \^\^  
I found therapists close to me by talking to the [dgti](https://dgti.org/) counselor closest to me, I wrote an email to her and we made an appointment for her to tell me what I need to do and which therapists close to me work with trans people.
the endo can deny it on any reason he wants :) A good endo takes the indication and give you HRT. And a bad endo, that makes up rules, you should leave immideatly because the chances of getting wrong hrt are enourmos
Then you’re a girl, because why eff else would you choose to be a girl if you had to be stuck on an island by yourself? I think some therapists try the “feminine guy” bit because they know full on transitioning is probably the most difficult thing you will ever do. There are more dangerous things, and more heroic things, but with the amount of time and persistence transitions takes, few can compare. Maybe a moon rocket trip or something. Just getting rid of the beard is a five year ordeal. The “feminine” guy could maybe be persuaded to cross dress on the week ends, or wear a pink shirt and some little earrings (I dunno)…

I’m Older, granted, but I went in with the assumption I’d never fully pass, and I would not have sex with anyone ever again. And that I might live alone with my dogs for the rest of my life. I still did it. I am not suggesting that as anyone’s criteria, but keep in mind that that prospect is possible. I’m enjoying my life right now, I like my clothes, they are always clean and look nice. I am always clean, witH good hygiene, I don’t leave the house without my hair groomed, a bit of makeup and perfume. I feel better about being in groups of people even if I don’t pass. My way of interacting with people suits my gender now. Best wishes, R
Ah, well that's hella shitty. I'm honestly not sure what your options are, maybe there are organizations that help with that stuff? Other then that, I just wish you good luck.
Than it’s completely up to you! Don’t allow someone else to dictate what you want or need.
I donno. Different for everyone. I sincerely was doing fine until I wasn’t. Had to muck around in some scary mental health problems and sort myself out, deal with trauma I didn’t even know existed, honestly took the pandemic and shut down for me to slow down long enough to not disassociate through existence to notice the problems.
Blood values can get monitored by any medical professional, my family doctor is doing this in my case, also there are free labs you can go and let you blood check there.
no, look into the BGA (Begutachtungsrichtlinien des Medizinischen Dienstes der Krankenkassen), for SRS in Germany you only need 12 therapy sessions in at least 6 months, 1 year of being out in daily life (what counts as this is decided only by your therapist as they confirm that)

&#x200B;

Look in r/germantrans there is a post with all conditions pinned
Overseas pharmacies like AllDayChemist and InHousePharmacy. You skip the page where it asks for your prescription, and they look the other way. Sublingual estradiol tablets and spironolactone are what I get from my doctor here in the US. 50 spiro twice a day, 2mg thrice a day. The first few months were 2mg/day, the next few months were 4mg/day. Most of my dosage was decided by feeling. Your body knows when the estro is working, and when it's time to adjust dosage. Also, lab work can be done anywhere for any reason.
I don't know if you would be rejected for SRS over unofficial HRT, but I'd be mad as hell if they refused. Your therapist is an absolute jackass.
Your therapist is old and backward as well as transphobic, I'd complain to the governing body of therapists that she is not suitable for trans patients as well as transphobic and working from outdated standards
Yea, I feel like transgender therapy should be to aid the person, not to judge if they can transition. Who are they to stop a person from changing their own body. Such a thing inevitably becomes a political thing as well. (makes you dependent on the view of the random psychologist that you end up with, or whatever the definitions are that have been made)
They’re long in the US too but yeah I think getting a new therapist would be a good idea. And to let them know right away on the first day that you’re there to talk about gender dysphoria
i know some feminine guys and this is not something i have heard from them ever.

What you are describing sounds like you are a woman/girl and want others to recognize that and your body to reflect that.
Just tell her to give you the letter, that you feel insulted by her insinuating that you're not a girl and that you will be making a complaint against her
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

I mean what else am I supposed to do? She predicted I might get hrt by January if the second opinion has time for the indication until then.

In December, when I searched for therapists in a 100km radius to me, the next-shortest waiting time would've been until mid 2023.

If I need to wait another 2 years for hrt, I can't guarantee I'll still be stable enough to not off myself
>Her insinuating that you need mental duress to be trans, and that she either doesn't know how things like the indication work or that shes lying, these are big red flags. If you want to continue to go there please be careful

Depending on what version of the DSM she's using, ""clinically significant distress"" can be listed an exclusionary criteria...it's an issue I've run up against.

Which honestly I think is bullshit; just because dysphoria isn't interrupting basic executive function doesn't mean it's not a problem for the person...
It's rather because she has no waiting list an I called her at the right time

She didn't say that trans people couldn't hold a job but she rather said that I'm suprisingly stable in comparison to other trans patients of hers.
I just didn't know how to word it better in English.
Koblenz, hatte bis jetzt Therapeuten angefragt bis Trier und Bonn
This is huge, tysm! :D
Well, my house doctor is now over an hour away from me since I moved and I heard that finding a new doctor is really difficult because they're terribly overrun and don't like taking new patients.

Also it involves calling people >\~< Because most of this fucking country hasn't discovered emails yet.
Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen. A life with an unbalanced endocrine system is a half-life. A life without estrogen is how Karens are born. Without estrogen, us women metamorphose into unrecognizable lycanthropic mawbeasts from hell.
Yea, I got to this one unsure of myself to explore my gender.  
Maybe she still sees me like that and is unsure because of that
I don't really feel like a feminine guy either. I'd rather just have myself replaced by a girl.

Plus I need to be deemed trans for half the things I listed like hrt or srs.  
If I didn't need to be trans for that I couldn't care less about the label people gave me.
Yea i don't know its a tough situation im so sorry. Its completly up to you how you handle this, shes taking away your dignity but i think if you get HRT in the end i guess who cares.

I am just worried, shes clearly not trustable so like who knows what happens in january even with a ""second opininon"". Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there? When its just a one time thing they can sometimes give you some time much earlier than the waitlists. Also if its only a one or two time thing you can look much further away than your usual search radius
I would classify a desire to transition that is so strong that denial of transition gives you suicidal thoughts as definitly and obviously ""distressed enough"". If your therapist is aware of this and still feels like you're not ""trans enough"" just because you're able to function most of the time, that therapist is either stupid or - more likely - just a bad person and worse therapist. Like, come on. From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

I don't know your exact situation, obviously, but I would try to impress on her how much hrt means to you and you deserve to get it one last time (it sucks that this is necessary, but so it goes). If that doesn't work, drop that therapist like a hot potato and try again with someone else. Also sucks, but again, so it goes.

Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, _especially_ if you're allready socially transitioning.

Good luck <3
Have a look at the list of therapists on the website Transmann e.V. (despite the name, it's not just for trans men). Some of them do remote appointments, I got my Indikationsschreiben about a week after emailing a therapist (making it clear I only wanted the Indikation, not ongoing therapy) from that list. It was a single 30 minute zoom call after which I had the indikation. I'm not sure what it's like if you're in a different state from the therapist, but you may have some luck looking near large cities, like Berlin.
Being so dysphoric you'd want to off yourself isn't enough for her to see you're under stress?
Just for the record, statements like “I won’t be stable in 2 years without hrt” and “there are ‘only’ some days where dysphoria is incapacitating” don’t strike me as particularly light dysphoria. Not that it’s strictly needed to transition anyways.
well yes ofc theres still alot of transphobia in the diagnostic manuals, but thats why someone labelled a ""trans specialist"" should know better. I could forgive this if it was just some uneducated therapist who just looked up gender dysphoria for the first time, but not someone who gets trans clients referred directly to them. Disgraceful
Utter billshit that is. None of my trans friends here have any major problems that would keep them out of work or school?

And the reason you got in quickly is that she sucks and loses patients all the time. So obviously new spots open up every week if she‘s this bad at her job.


The fuck? Whether you have other psychological conditions is completely irrelevant as to your gender dysphoria.


And you clearly list dysphoria caused by your body anyway.


And you don‘t even need bloody dysphoria to be trans in the first place.


That‘s such an outdated backwards gatekeeping bullshit she‘s spouting.


Try finding a Gyn etc prescribing hormones via private prescription in the meantime and start looking for s therapist that‘s fit to practice afterwards.


It‘s utter bullshit she‘s placed in front of you.


Also theres is the Germantrans subreddit as well :)
googling for labs? I can only give you the adress from one in Bochum, but no clue, where you live.
>Despite seeing a doctor for HRT, I am still very likely to get an estrogen-sensitive cancer in 20-30 years based on my genes. I still chose the estrogen.

Same. For some time now I said I'd rather die to cancer as a 35yo woman than to old age as a 70yo man.
>Have you tried just getting an appointment with a psychiatrist without going into permanent therapy there?

Don't I need to still do 12 sessions of therapy for the endocrinologist first?  
And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?
>From what you've said you've allready started socially transitioning, that's not a cis person thing to do, wtf to that therapist.

Well, I've been out everywhere except work for some months now. And that only because I want to wait for hrt before outing myself at work. The only reason I don't girlmode daily is because doing my makeup to the point of actually passing takes far too long and wigs are kinda uncomfortable.

>Research the actual laws for hrt (I get that this is super hard, there is barely any good, current information out there, but I think many people in this comment thread are allready sharing accurate information). I can only compare to how it is in Austria, and here you can get hrt pretty quickly, especially if you're allready socially transitioning.

I've been told by my therapist and by the dgti representative that I needed to do 12 mandatory therapy sessions and depending on the endo I might need to do a year of openly living as a woman without hrt.

Also therapists slots to be able to bill insurance companies are limited and the number has been the same for like 15 years. Which is why the wait times are so horrendously long
No, it's fine  
I just wanted to complain that I have to get on the phone and call people
Absolute Queen.
Like i said, the 12 sessions of therapy thing is a lie. If you want 12 sessions to feel comfortable with everything thats completly fine and up to you, but you are not required to do that.

  
The Endo just wants the indication letter, and that letter can be written at any point, by anyone with a degree working in the field of psychology. I made an appointment two weeks before, got my indication in one hour, and went to the endocrinologist the same day. You are being medically gatekept and gaslighted

&#x200B;

>  
\>And isn't it better to still have a therapist who's there for you after you started hrt?<  


I think thats up to you and at what point in your life and transition you are. Having a therapist thats there for you is always a plus, but only if they are on your side
My doctor just referred me to an endocrinologist because my testosterone levels were so low and estrogen was so high. Apparently it’s to do with my pituitary gland, but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old
Oh geez. I'm sorry that really sucks. I guess my advice of insisting harder with your current therapist still stands though. Good luck <3 you'll get there
So you're telling me I could've been on hrt for the last year?  
I'm gonna go to the toilet at work now, cry my eyes out, and then go back to acting like it doesn't phase me.
>but I’ve always known I’m trans since I was around 6/7 years old

Me too but I never knew how to read the signs
Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted, on the contrary, i think if you talk to a therapist/psychiatrist who isn't transphobic the way you described your identity to us here, i have no doubt youll get your indication and hrt in no time. I still got super lucky, but thats because our system is fucked up and rigged. I just want you to know that what youre experiencing is def not proper procedure

Okay heres what you do: Don't ditch your therapist right away, but just give as many psychiatrists on [https://queermed-deutschland.de/](https://queermed-deutschland.de/) (if you have trouble navigating the website just ask) a ring as you can, describe your situation and just say that after youve been in therapy already for a while, you want an indication. Dont make a big deal out of it. One of them will give you an appointment.

Im sorry youre hurting, but i cant stand transphobic therapists acting like they have authority over you. You deserve so much better, everything will be fine❤️❤️
Neither did I, until I went to secondary school, and began wondering I would rather sit around with the girls and play when I was in my infant and junior schools. But you try to just shrug it off thinking it’s normal right? If you hang out with the girls one of them might get to like you. Then I realised it’s not just a girl meets boy thing but hang on, somethings not quite right! I couldn’t wait to get home from school and go get my sisters underwear out and put it on then to my mum’s drawer to get her forms, but after leaving school I fought and fought the girly thing, buried it deep inside but every now and then it would raise it’s ugly head and I’de be back to square one. I now have 3 divorces under my belt and my dysphoria is stronger than it’s ever been, every day I get up to have to get dressed up, problem is I’m still closeted. Went to the doctor and spoke to about my inabilities and he just referred me to an endocrinologist saying my pituitary gland is showing as producing more oestrogen than testosterone. We’ll see what happens on October 3rd and my appointment!
>Nooooo don't 😢!! That time isn't wasted

Let's be real with ourselves, like the last 20 years of my life were wasted, but there's nothing I can realistically do about it so it's fine I guess.

>Okay heres what you do: Don't ditch your therapist right away, but just give as many psychiatrists on https://queermed-deutschland.de/ (if you have trouble navigating the website just ask) a ring as you can, describe your situation and just say that after youve been in therapy already for a while, you want an indication.

But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<. Only the thought of having to call someone makes my palms sweat. And then there's these terrible office hours most therapists have which make them basically unreachable without taking a day of work.

I fear that the endocrinologist my therapist recommended to me might be one of the bad ones. But they're the only one I can find for Rheinland-Pfalz on the site you sent.

You think I'm good or should I rather try ones further away from me?
>But calling up people is bad enough as it is >\~<

Yea i feel that, i mean I couldnt do that either i legit had to go get my mom to make calls since i was out of mental energy after maybe two. If you got someone close to you that wants to help that could be handy! But yeah phone is torture i wish there was a different way. Just emalis and writing takes too long or you never get a response
Maybe you could ask a friend or someone you trust to make those calls for you?   


And yeah, it must be really frustrating that after all this time you've been lied to and could have progressed much sooner than you though. The thing is, now that you know better, you actually CAN progress earlier than what you thought earlier, and that is a positive, right?
I get you on the whole phone phobia thing, it’s why I didn’t make a doctors appointment for like 6 months🫠
Give this one a shot first, you never know! And if that one doesn't work out then try others. You can even make appointment with other ones in advance and cancel if the first one turns out fine to speed up the process
I don't think I can progress any earlier than right now. I have the earliest free appointment with the endocrinologist already. I just need to get an indication until december
How would I tell if that one's good?  
I don't know anything about hormones, he could tell me anything lol
Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Es ist zwar echt unnötig und nervtötend, aber HRT ist ne Riesen Sache für dich und deinen Körper, deshalb nur zu Experten, und nur zu Leuten die transpositiv eingestellt sind. Kein Risiko eingehen und lieber ein paar Stunden fahrt und dann ist man aber in guten Händen. Da muss man am Anfang 4 Mal im Jahr hin, später 2 und dann 1 mal im Jahr das geht klar
und ich häng das hiernochmal als Kommentar hintendran, wie erkenne ich ob Endo/Arzt gut oder schlecht ist für mich als Trans Person ohne mich medizinisch auskennen zu müssen:

Green Flags:

* Sie gendern dich korrekt, oder bemühen sich zumindest darum, benutzen deinen chosen Name selbst wenn deine Dokumente noch nicht geändert sind.
* Sie gehen auf deine Bedürfnisse ein. Das bedeutet wenn du Kommentare zb zu deiner Hormondosis hast werden diese ernst genommen anstatt dass man einfach abgefertigt wird. Im Zweifelsfall kannst du immer Hormonwerte auf Reddit posten und schauen, der Hivemind hier hat mehr Ahnung und deckt auf wenn dein Endo dir nicht die richtige Dosis verschreibt
* Termine drehen sich um dein Anliegen nicht um deine Identität, das bedeutet ein Besuch beim Endo sieht zb so aus: Kurze Besprechung, Ziele festlegen bzw schauen wie man sich grade fühlt -> Blutabnehmen -> Nächster Termin machen und tschüss. 20 Minuten maximal

Wenn da in der Mitte ein Verhör eingebaut wird ob du dir auch wirklich ""sicher"" bist oder fragen als wärst du vor Gericht, dann sind wir bei den Red Flags

Red Flags:

* Invasive Fragen. Dazu gehören Fragen zu deiner Sexualität,  sexuelle Praktiken, Sexuelle Vergangenheit, deine Identität, deine Kindheit, Trauma etc. Größte Red Flag von allen.
* Gatekeeping, also das verlangen von überflüssigen ""Beweisen"", Indikation ist zumindest bei der HRT das absolute Maximum, wenn Worte wie ""Alltagstest"" oder dergleichen kommen sofort gehen. Und uns anderen Bescheid sagen
>Ohje also ich hab daheim in Rheinland-Pfalz ( da komm ich auch her kleine Welt, aber eher bei Landau) auch niemanden gefunden damals. Bin dann immer nach München gefahren extra für die HRT, bei Medicover.

Meinst du Ich sollte es dann in RLP versuchen oder eher jemand hier Empfohlenen aufsuchen?

Vielleicht kommt ja das 49€ Monatsticket, dann wäre die Fahrt zwar immernoch nervig aber wenigstens nicht mehr allzu teuer."	xc8ecz	trans	491	0.95	2022-09-12 09:39:16
Rant about cisgender ignorance	"I (FtM) am actually starting to genuinely hate cis people. I know its 'not all cis people', and 'their trying their best' ect, ect, but the vast majority of cis people I know are so infuriating when it comes to my identity. I have cis friends who will deadname me and invalidate me for the purpose of a joke; saying ""oh I dont hit girls"" or just straight up telling me ill never be a real man or finding my deadname to be the funniest thing ever and so they repeat it over and over. Although I present fairly masculine, im not medically transitioned at all so I have a pretty high voice and a more feminine figure ( though I do bind) and recently there was this guy ( a straight cis male ) who confessed to me about having feelings. I told him that I was a guy in which he responded ""I don't believe you!"" and when I told him I was transgender he said ""so the tiddies are fake?"" (implying that I was transfem). The whole situation is making me feel suddenly very insecure about how well I bind. I feel like I have a fairly high tolerance to cis people constantly misgendering and deadnaming me, but im just about at the edge. When I do say things like ""ugh, cis people can be SO annoying"" I immediately get attacked for ""grouping all cis people into one category"" or ""being to sensitive""."	"-guy
-trans

ah must be transfem ….wtf? idek what logic there. also fake tiddies? I hate that weird assumption transfems have fake tiddies and not real ones that grew
If they refuse to accept you for who you are they aren’t your friends
(( This might be a sensitive topic ))

I’m a transman and a big one I have is literally when I say “I wish I could just be a girl” and my friends always get confused and say weird things like “then why are you trans?”… This is such a big part of being trans that’s very misunderstood — the supposed “choice” of being trans. I didn’t choose this… and OBVIOUSLY also as a gay man, it would have been easier to be a female. But I choose to be who I am and transition. I find no shame in leaning into my desire and doing drag but people find it so confusing that a transman is now crossdressing. BEING TRANS ISN’T A CHOICE !!
Er, wtf? Those people are not your friends... Have you told them how you feel about them misgendering you? If they continue to invalidate you and hurt you like this then, they really don't care.
Can we add when you start to flirt with the opposite gender and they respond, ""Oh sorry I'm not gay"" to the list.

Seriously though, screw those people. You are totally valid in being upset at them. I'm not even in your situation and I'm upset at them.
Honestly, that is what cost me all of my irl friendships was me getting fed up abt the trans jokes or having shit talked abt other queer people but always going ""but we respect you""; like thanks for saying you don't go after me because you know me, but have no issue attacking others. And it ended in ""you've gotten too sensitive and we can't joke around you anymore"" out of my just asking for basic respect. Then they go full on Shocked Pikachu when I didn't want to be with them anymore.

People who don't and won't have our experiences don't get it because, and especially with The Cishets ™️, everything is okay to joke about until you stand up; then nothing is and you're a stick in the mud.

The friends who get and love you will always do so, and they will stay. Don't taint your heart around people you need to wear a mask with.
Sorry, I skipped out on swimming today because I took a regular top I mistook for a swim top. I’m a transfem enby, and I didn’t want to be subjected to a bunch of staring. Most of my interactions with cis people are normally fine but some cis people are incredibly rude, they stare or threaten or insult, and even a lot of allies only offer surface level support if it doesn’t inconvenience them. It isn’t all cis people though, and we can try to be as accurate as possible with language because it sucks when cis people blame all trans people for the act of an individual, and we can be better than that.

I get it though, there’s a lot of valid complaints to be made about the behaviour of cis people in general
jesus, cis people are incredibly annoying… in my house, i’ve got “i accept you, i guess, but you’re too young to know” and “transgender people are freaks of nature!!! you’re an abomination!!! there are only two genders!!! if i was trans i would kill myself!!!” and i’ve got to just *deal with it*. i’m telling you, little kids are more understanding than certain cishet teens/adults.
I feel this in my soul. Someone who claimed to be an ally compared me to a man the other day even though I look nothing like a man anymore and it’s not sat right with me since. Cis people are the worst lol
Get new friends. Unfortunate as it is, if they repeatedly deadname, incorrectly gender you, use the wrong pronouns, make your transition the butt of their jokes and make you feel self conscious about yourself - they are not people worth hanging around.

And you need to tell them that - how you feel. Then leave them.

As hard as that is, I don’t know how long they have been your friends, it’s very easy for me to say this without the attachment you might have to them but if you are writing all this then you might need to reflect on what your friendship means to them and their friendship means to you.
ik what u mean fr
I feel you king, my friends have also used my deadname as a joke. Its beyond painful, cis people really are just fucking twisted.
We live, actually...we barely survive in *their* fucked up world. I know how people are not the enemy, their concepts are, but they are the ones who, by convinience of the world, step over us. I don't think I can actually be in a relationship with a cis person, and maybe that is because in my core I know that to all of them I will never really be a person but a thing. Tbh, every group is a collection of people and people (we) suck, the amount of disgust inside our community among ourselves is also a fucking shitty thing. But cis people still are the other side, the one on top, and anyone of them, being a supposed ally or full on JRK of life, live through the mechanisms which build our misery. 

So yeah, I kinda feel I have my reasons to hate cis people too. It's like [""Plato's Allegory of the Cave""](https://youtu.be/1RWOpQXTltA).
Oh yeah, dude, i get that! /gen

And when cis people say stuff about trans people being ""wrong"" or something like that, they get support for saying that, a round of applause or whatever.

I once got called confused for being trans, uh I'm sure I am trans, not confused, that'll be all my other aspects tho, I'm oftentimes really confused in a lot of things but definitely not my gender identity, which I have carefully reflected for a loooong time! That bigot thought that all trans people are confused, it's not that easy to find out that you're trans in a lot of cases, so we're definitely not confused... /lh
I feel ya. There are thankfully exceptions but I always have my guard up around most cis people because I know the vast majority of them will end up misgendering me and not on accident. Also I know the vast majority of cis people have such vastly different experiences to me that they will never understand me and I mean that not as in they won’t get me on some deep level but the most basic facts of my existence are incomprehensible to them, like my gender or my pronouns or why I feel so uncomfortable for example when being forced to use gendered toilets or why the sports I do being gender segregated bothers me so much. They don’t understand gender dysphoria or euphoria and they don’t understand why I’m doing all of this and I sometimes feel like they might as well live on a different planet than me. So even when they aren’t being intentionally transphobic they’re most likely going to be unintentionally transphobic or are gonna see me as this person who is only nonbinary and nothing else and who they’re gonna ask to explain things until they are completely exhausted. The cis people who aren’t like that, usually those that already spend time around trans people a lot are rare
concerning thing, I get this exact kind of shit from *trans* people
It sounds like you should find some new friends. They clearly are not supportive. In NYC, our circle of friends would never act like this toward any one of our trans friends. Can I ask what part of the country/world you live in?
This is so true to how it is but from my experience it's not even just cis people sometimes and it's like they want to treat you like some sort of animal or collectors item that they control as if we aren't independent. And I mean sometimes this is caused by people just not really understanding but it can get really annoying and degrading. In your case however if they aren't taking you seriously and you have sat down and talked to them about it already they are just being plain rude. Please don't get me wrong, I do believe in the individuals freedoms but there are certain things where it's like yeah you  are allowed to those opinions and actions but you can be entitled to those without me being your friend.
I know how you feel as another ftm, I’m absolutely petrified of being in public, I’m always so worried someone will call me “ma’am” or just straight up harass me- but I promise those people ARE NOT YOUR FRIENDS. If the people who are meant to make you feel safe are bullying you and making you uncomfortable, you need to cut ties with them
Honestly it sounds like you hang out with high school douchebags. You might consider changing your friend group. Not categorically, but some of the worst offenders.
Those ain't your friends, man. That whole group is toxic and staying with them is only gonna hurt your mental health.
Hey, cis woman here. Please hear me out. We suck, I am more than aware of that. Like, wholeheartedly, we’ve been fuckin’ assholes. The whole reason I’m on this subreddit is to try and understand the community better so that I can be a better friend to my trans siblings, and get advice on how I can help them.

Here’s my little bit of advice. Your “friends” seem like bigots, they might not be the people for you. Please discuss it with them, let them know how it makes you feel, and if they don’t stop, leave, they don’t deserve your friendship. 

You don’t have to listen to what I have to say, but if you would like any advice on how to proceed, I am more than happy to give it. Don’t hesitate to ask.

You’re doing great.

Wow wtf they aren’t friends. They are people one would only talk to if one was a masochist. Seriously you need better friends
I threatened to beat the shit out of my coworker for deadnaming me ""as a joke"". He never did it again after that.
Hi, 

I'm a cis woman. That sucks, and tbh, it sounds like your friends should respect you. They sound like arseholes. I'm friends with a trans man and myself (nor his other group of friends) would never deadname him or say such things. In the past, when I have accidentally misgendered him, I say ""sorry about that, I meant he"" and then pass over it. He doesn't like me to make a big deal, nor do I want to. 

It would be ignorant of me to say ""get new friends"" because it can be hard, but your current friends do seem to be awful. I don't know what else to suggest, but I just want you to know that there are people out there who would love to be your friend and would respect you and your identity. 

My partner is a trans woman and some of her friends ""don't get it"". Like when she came out, her best friend said ""I'm here for you, my man"". He wasn't even being horrible, he genuinely just doesn't ""get it"". My partner had to put boundaries in place and talk it out with him. It was a long and often arduous process, but her friends are getting better at respecting her. 

I can understand why you're frustrated. :( X
I’m not gonna lie I’m feeling the same way especially with the LGB folk who are apart of the withouttheT movement. I had no idea there were so many LGB who hate us and do the same with misgendering/deadnaming/misogyny. I’ve been really having a hard time dealing with as of late
Dude these are not your friends. No friend, even cis would talk to you and treat you like that. Dump them.
Do you know that meme that shows a picture of philosophers talking with a caption above that says “Talking to other trans people about gender’?   To the right of it is a photo captioned, “Talking to cis people about gender.” It shows a nursery school teacher showing a basic toy to a 2-year-old and the child reaching to grasp it.  [Here it is](https://www.ousa.ca/blog_being_an_ally) if you’ve not seen it. 

I really strive at not wasting my energy on idiots, letting them space inside my head - and believe me there are quite a few of them out there.  

I sense that you are a young person -?   I was a teen and in my early 20s in the 80s and too afraid to say I was trans.  What I encountered as someone visibly male but who had some feminine interests and qualities is that people, “friends” insisted I was really gay and just hadn’t figured it out yet.  It actually got rather toxic.  I was dating girls and these “friends” were insisting I go out with a guy friend who had a huge crush on me.  I abandoned that whole group of friends because they seemed incapable of letting me life as I wished.  

Of course, I knew they were reading my transness and mislabeling it but back then, there wasn’t a broad understanding about the difference between sexual orientation and gender identity - there often still isn’t. 

I hope you can come to a place where you find your people, a group of true friends.  That may take relocating to a new town or a city one day.  People only come to a place of understanding, kindness, and empathy if they are willing - trying to reason with unwilling people and fretting because they won’t change is a bit like hitting yourself in the head with a hammer and then being angry at the hammer.  I just don’t engage with people unless they really are curious and show a sincere willingness to learn about my experience.  Otherwise, I won’t even waste my anger on them.
How you bind and how you present is irrelevant to how good friends should and will treat you. Ya know?
Wow, I think you need new friends. That's complete utter bullshit would they joke about a friends weight? Or a person's skin tone? Seriously, none of that is ok!!
Well I can tell you as a ""good ol boy"" ""red neck"" type cis guy, we had a buddy growing up we'll call Mary. Now when I met Mary he explained what trans was and how all of that worked and Mary was our bro. Then one day Mary was ready to become Jeff. The learning curve was tough for a bit because I always knew him as Mary but me and all the guys learned. My point in telling you this is if your friends are being dicks about it they don't sound like friends to me. As to your other point about the guy hitting on you and questioning your identity,  for that all I can offer you is my sympathies. I know it must be incredibly difficult for you and I'm sorry.
I don't think these people are really your friends; most of my friends are cis and none deadname me, sure they occasionally messed up my pronouns a couple of times (which tbf I haven't done anything to pass), but immediately corrected themselves. Some of them don't exactly understand as well as others, but even they will correct other people if I get misgendered. Ofc I also have some ""friends"" in the category yours are but we have very low interactions with each other to begin with; all in all I would say most cis people are more ignorant about the subject due to lack of exposure, but I hope u can find some friends who don't do that to you.
Personally I don't think that's being too sensitive you have a right to how you feel
I’m so sorry! That’s terrible that he would say that. I’m MtF and so far I haven’t had many problems. I do get people calling me sir every now and then because of my voice and I hate it but I haven’t had anything too crazy happen. I think maybe men just aren’t as accepting to trans men as women are to trans women? Maybe they feel threatened or something?
Listen it is okay to hate the ignorance but don’t all cispeople. For just as us they have no control over their identity. Plus it’s hard for someone to understand something they’ve never experienced. What needs to happen is we need to spread awareness of this ignorance and further campaigns spreading empathy towards trans people. Hate is learned and ignorance is a deficiency in learning. So the key would be to break out of the stereotype. To show the cis people evidence that we are just like them. Except we evolve like Pokémon.
Those aren't you're friends. Those are ignorant assholes. If they don't accept you for who you are and joke about you're identity. They're not your friends
Get new friends. They're not your friends and they only keep you around because they're insecure and need something to make fun of. They're assholes and cut them out of your life
You need new friends my dude.
They will not change. 
They'll just continue to hurt.
I'm sorry you're going through this. I went through it on a smaller scale with people I thought were my best friends. I have tig ol biddies and a bad back and can't bind. I let them go, for that and other reasons, because I just couldn't feel uncared for anymore. Letting go of my old friends hurt and hurts still, and I'm still working on getting new friends. But it doesn't hurt as bad as the people who were supposed to support me tearing me down.
I feel ya on the not wanting cis friends. It's tiring and painful.
I hope you find peace king <3 you're valid and deserve respect
I think your friends suck ass. Just like with family, friends who make you uncomfortable and unsupported aren't worth sticking around to.
Although with your friends it's easier to get rid of them by ending your friendship.
You deserve better people around you than them.
brother, i have nothing to say, i just wanted to picture myself with that 'bruhther' accent
I’m sorry, I will never understand what your going though but the cis people at your school are the worst, I’m cis (like for now I’m thinking about she/they) and I hope I am never that horrible, the people at your school suck ass
I feel you… even the best intentioned people are just ignorant about trans/gender issues and make no effort to “do the work”. When I came out and explained how I don’t wanna hear my deadname anymore, my sister in law thought it would be a good idea to launch into a commentary about how my deadname was really unisex (it’s not) and I could have kept it. And when I ask her to stop talking about it she unleashed a tirade about how intolerant *I* am. And then there are people like my parents, who claim to have read up on these things but then give me inquisitive looks when I mention dysphoria. Or my dad, who (in between misgendering me) tried to convince me that I was too sensitive when I complained that a stranger on the street called me a shem*le. I meet more women who are educated about these things, but I’ve pretty much given up on cis men altogether.
I sometimes just wanna say ”I hate cis-people” eventhough I know it’s not all.
They’re just so unknowing of our situation and they always judge (depending on who they are) you just because of how you look or sound. Like who are you to care if someone has different genitalia than what they want. Like I don’t understand why cis people can be so annoying.
One cis dude said “How come you’re transgender if you didn’t had surgery?” when I told him I’m non-op… like I’m done.
1. Those cis ""friends"" don't deserve the title of friend because they aren't just ignorant they are transphobic if they think causing a trans person discomfort or trauma is funny. And 2. I'm sorry that other cis ignorant people's dumb little comments about your body make you feel dysphoric and shit I'm so sorry. Just remember you are loved and you are strong. There are stupid people out there and that's not going to stop and if it did what else would we have to rant about without them/jk
You know you are a man and that's all that matters nobody else validation matters as much as your own I know others words are important as well but your view of yourself is what really pulls you through.
Honesty dude I totally get it. It can be really exhausting to deal with people who treat you like that all the time. I’m really sorry and I hope those people either get a grip or you find better people to call friends.
This is a shitty thing your friend circle is doing. Part of it might be age: teenagers often don't understand how hurtful their little jokes can be. Part of it is certainly that most of them don't understand what it's like to be trans.

However, since most of the other commenters have sympathized with the phenomenon of cis people being jerks, I want to counterbalance that with another thought.

Stereotyping cis people as transphobes can rob you of many potential supportive, loving friends.

I came out publicly over the past couple of months. The vast majority of my social connections are cis. They don't know what it's like to transition. But they're also respectful and caring. They don't make these jokes or deadname me. They only misgender me out of habit (since they've known me as a man for so long), but correct themselves when they notice or when I point it out. They've been nothing but respectful and supportive. They have made the experience much easier than it might have been.

Now I'm not trying to make you feel bad since your friends are not respectful the way mine have been. I'm pointing out that the problem is not that your friends are cis. It's that they are immature/disrespectful/ignorant/whatever.

It's true that transphobia is deeply rooted in our collective unconscious. But so is racism. So is sexism. Being a good ally is possible, even though you'll probably still sometimes say and do racist or sexist or transphobic things. That's true of all of us. The key difference between being friend material or not is whether a person is willing to be corrected when it happens.

Retreating to groups like this where cis people are rare helps us heal, but please try not to let your experience engender in you a stereotype of cis people as inveterate transphobes. Decent cis people are not as rare as it sometimes seems.
That shit happens to me all the time and I am medically transitioning. It drives me crazy that so many cis people are so stupid that they can’t learn new things. How I hear most cis people: “Mommy and daddy told me that gender and sex is the same thing 40 years ago and that’s simple and I can’t handle complex thought.” It doesn’t matter how much scientific evidence trans people have or how much they know it hurts our community, they refuse to even consider own side.
once i was hanging out with a friend and she was ranting about boys (which idc about) and ig she thought i was offended so she said “but yk.. just the real men” and my day was ruined
Know how you feel. At my old school I had a group of cis friends who would repeat my dead name over and over and over again just to insult me because I upset them. At my new school, I've repeated my pronouns over and over and over again (at least 10+ times) and people STILL misgender me as if on purpose. I'm right at the edge of hating cis people too.
It sounds like you have awful friends. I cant imagine treating someone I consider a friend like this. I'm sorry :(
I feel this and so much rage attached.

Recently needed to get some meds and because the pharmacist believed that there are only two kinds of genitals and assumed my gender and then my genitals, I had an argument w them. I finally admitted that I am trans and then even there they assumed the wrong direction and I was wtf I just need this meds. I anyway know better than u....

Also fuck your friends, who are deadnaming you, that sounds horrible and so disrespectful. Even if an AFAB transmasc would look high femme this would not be ok at all or change a thing in regards to how fucked up and disrespectful this is. I think u should literally just punch them in their faces...
I mean the obvious thing to do is getting new friends, you deserve people who respect your identity. Of course that's easier said than done so I'll just wish you good luck and send you a virtual ghost hug. Hang in there my dude! <3
It depends who you talk to. These people are transphobic and u should leave them or ur just gonna hang around ppl who make u feel shit. Like ppl who are educated about it are in the majority more so nowadays. Many cis ppl I know get it and respect it depends on the person.
So the way I see it, you’ve got a few options, some are mutually exclusive, some aren’t. 

Firstly, learning the art of not giving a fuck, and I’m not saying this as a criticism to you, it’s a tough thing to learn. Life is full of well meaning people who *think* they’re helping. They’ll pester you about anything that seems out of the ordinary, or even things that are just different from them. Then there are the assholes, we’ve all met some of them. Both of these groups can sour a good day if you let them, but you gotta remember that you are who you are and they can’t change that. If they don’t like that, they can fuck off. If they aren’t willing to accept you for who you are, then they aren’t worth being a part of your life, which leads me to the second thing. 

I have a hard time telling whether or not your friends are just ignorant, or downright assholes. With them, there are generally two paths you can take (though there is a third path of doing nothing). You can simply move on to better people. If they’re knowingly treating you like shit, then move on. It sucks having to find new friends, but its better in the long run. The second option is to sit down and talk to them. You explain to them what it means to be you and who you are. You tell them what is and isn’t aceptable treatment. If they’re ignorant and care about you as a friend, they’ll listen, if they don’t care, then it’s probably best to move on. 

To give a personal anecdote, I’m almost blind. I’ve got a visual impairment caused by underdeveloped nerves. There is no cure, and glasses/contacts don’t help. I could try and describe how much I can see, but it wouldn’t give you the full picture because i have no reference of “normal.” This state of weaker eyesight is how it’s always been for me, so without experiencing it though my body, you wouldn’t truly be able to understand. Now why is this important? I have had many experiences dealing with ignorant sighted. When I was younger, my friends would hide my stuff because they thought it was funny. It’s not funny. The punchline to that joke was an unspoken “look! She can’t see!” They weren’t trying to be mean, they were just ignorant. I ended up telling them that pulling shit like that was not acceptable and they stopped. Another time, I was thanking a different friend for being so understanding about my eyesight and helping me when I need it. She told me “the truth is, I don’t understand, your eyesight is so different that I probably won’t ever understand it. I just try my best to help when I notice you struggling with something and I’ve been trying to understand what you can and can’t see.” 

These two examples show ignorant people compared to a person who was doing her best to understand something different from her. You are right, though. It is easy to bundle everyone and disregard them. For you the ignorant cis, for me the ignorant sighted. But you must remember that some of them are genuinely trying, they just need someone to help them understand a little better. Others are assholes and refuse to be taught. Leave them out of your life.

Anyways I hope my ramblings help in some way or another. You got this!
I’ve been lucky lately and I know quite a few cis people that are super active in not only being good about my real name and pronouns, but also correcting others when they misgender or deadname me. 

That being said, I’ve also come across so so so many that are intentional about misgendering or deadnaming me just because they like to see me flinch. Some people just fucking suck.
Sounds like you need new friends 😒 
Real friends doesnt do this bullshit..
people like that are absolutely not worth your time
Quite simply, these people are all transphobic
I get that, I've had multiple people ask me for my dead name or try to guess it. The idea of someone trying to find out my dead name after I've told them I'm not going to tell them makes me uncomfortable (ftm). I look fairly masc most times but my voice always gives me away, and once I talk I get the ""are you a girl"" question.
If you consider those transphobic asses your 'friends' than I strongly recommend you to trim the tree of toxicity.
At this point I don’t really get close to cis people in general.
I am a trans woman, and I can totally relate. Although I do wear makeup and present myself as feminine, I am not yet medically transitioned ether. I still look like a man, and straight women and gay men still find me attractive. Also Lesbians and straight guys don't. (I am pansexual.) I get called by my deadname all the time. Also everyone keeps getting my pronouns wrong. I can totally relate.
Your so called friends sound like wankers
That sucks so bad! 

I don't present en femme very often because it's not safe to come out to my wife's family yet, but when those who know don't even consider the little things, like my pronouns or deciding to refer
 to me as a man, it hurts... It must suck all that much more for you. And I feel terrible about it.
YES! I (ftm, pre transition) had this ex friend, cishet guy, who once told me he would kiss me (if i wanted) like wtf??
Ik its such a weird assumption that everything on a transfem is ""fake"".
Just because a trans woman has boobs doesn't mean they are fake. Mine are fake, but not because I'm trans!
I think that a huge number of cis people just don't have the foggiest idea of how hormones work. It wouldn't be as aggravating as it is if they just weren't so confidently incorrect.
This! Sounds like op is surrounded by tools for friends who aren’t able to properly respect someone’s transition
THIS!!! THIS COMMENT! My fucking god! I swear, as a fellow trans gay man, WHY DO CIS PEOPLE REFUSE TO LISTEN?! It is so unbelievably hard to explain that NO, I DID NOT CHOSE TO BE A BOY ALL OF A SUDDEN. If I could be anything, I’d choose to be cis! God I hate it when people say that, I’m glad someone else understands
EXACTLY! i will want to do some makeup or something because that is a thing I enjoy doing and miss doing, and suddenly I was ""faking being trans"" or actually ""wanting to be a feminine Girl"".
ESPECIALLY cis people who are the #1 biggest transgender supporters until it comes to their partner/child!
And that really effects me for some reason.  I love my gay friends and it is not an insult to be called gay but im not gay im a straight woman who happens to be trans abd like men and masculinity and when i get called gay i get depressed for days. Its just the lack of compassion, bc i dont feel that way about genuine mistakes but when someone shows they dont give a shit i genuinely get so sad about it.
Don’t forget “sorry, I’m a lesbian/I don’t date men”
> if i was trans i would kill myself

Oh, I don’t doubt that. Me and many other trans friends try
Those are AWFUL things to say to someone, Im sorry :( . I also get a lot off ""I accept and love you, but like, when are you going back to using your deadname?""
THIS! I have not medically transitioned, but on the outside i look fully male and its so confusing when cis people will have the pride to call me a ""she.""

Cis people are the worst, best of luck to you
Its hard because a lot of these cis friends are IN the lgbt community, and will say ""Im literally gay why would i be transphobic"" whenever I talk to them about it, as if you cant still be transphobic as a queer person.
exactly! Even by 'supporters' I have been constantly asked when I'm 'going back to using my deadname and being a girl' and the answer is. NEVER. people need to stop asking those questions, ESPECIALLY to trans youth.
Heya, I'm cis and the last point you made really resonated with me as several of my close friends are trans and I absolutely love them. You put up with so much hate for being who you are and I respect the hell out of how you still manage to be so loving and open-minded - you make the best friends a lot of the time because you've been through so much and this makes you more mature than most honestly.

Bit of a feeling dump there I just respect trans people a lot and I've always got your backs 💙
YES! Even with cis people who aren't directly transphobic, idk if this is weird wording, will tend to PASS transphobia on to me, saying things like ""Oh, my DAD/SPOUSE/ANYONE ELSE I RESPECT says that being trans is a disease and your going to hell!"" Like.. ok you obviously just said that to make me feel bad??

Im sorry though, I get a lot about what your saying of how tiring it is to constantly try to explain and get cis people to sympathize.
Spilled, I found especially if you're pre transition some older transgender folk will be just as horrible and cis people can be. It really sucks
I don't even feel excited anymore when I find out someone is trans because of how common this is.
YES! I have a friend who identifies with the SAME LABELS AS ME, trans and gay, and is fully untransitioned, and still has the audacity to make these jokes!
One of my friends who does this IS also a transman and present very femininely and I have been nothing but respectful to their identity and its annoying to not me treated the same lol
Thanks man :)
I think it goes both ways , but i'm happy to hear that your transition socially is going well!!
Homie, there's a difference between not understanding and being transphobic. Everything this person has described in the post was transphobia, not innocent ignorance on the topic. Lets not give transphobes a pillow to sit on now.
Lmfao valid reason
Just be ready to listen to others and learn and you'll be the best!
WOAH, that is some messed up shit, I'm sorry dude :( a lot of family members have gone on whiny rants about how ""beautiful"" my deadname was and how I could have kept it. I've also given up on cis men, Think im TfT.
When I was a trans CHILD i've had full grown cis people ask me what my genitalia are, I feel you with the annoyance.
I feel like asking what surgeries trans people have had is such a dumb thing. You don't go up to pretty people on the street and ask ""Aww your so cute, what surgeries did you have??""
YIKES that is so backhanded im sorry man :((
its like how people think transfems always wear wigs, does growing out hair seem completely alien to them??
I legit had a coworker ask me what my pussy looks like and if it feels like a “real one” on the inside.
I told him I wasn’t going to answer that, and that he was lucky he was driving or I’d have punched him.
Last year, even before I realised I was not straight ( I am cis as of now, on this sub for my transfem sister) I knew that any kind of queer isn’t a CHOICE YOU IDIOTS!!
yep! i love makeup and dressing up and being pretty, but my family doesnt understand that i can still be a boy while doing all that. i still do makeup, but usually its only when im girlmode, and ive kinda given up on ""feminine"" pretty clothes until im further along in my transition. 

i think next time it comes up though, ill point out that my brother wearing makeup or pretty clothes wouldn't make him less of a boy unless ***he*** said otherwise, so it shouldn't make ***me*** any less of a boy either. idk how well that would work for you bc i dont know how accepting/understanding your family is, but if you think it might help it click for them then i think its worth a shot!!

stay strong, brother. someday we'll get where we want to be <3
God this so much. My ex refused to stop calling me wife, and switch to husband, which functionally outed me to everyone he would introduce me to. He said he just preferred it better. I asked him not to on more than one occasion and he said he would be uncomfortable. He knew I was trans before we married Lmao so it’s not like I sprung this on him at any point
Oh for sure, and the ""sorry, I'm gay/I don't date women""

I get all three!
that’s. uhm. god, i hope you guys are ok…
41% of transgender people do and Its awful :(
Oh my god same, but like the opposite lol, when I went to the AP office at my school I was called a sir and I look nothing like a guy, like how, it's so transphobic cause all of the admin know I'm trans. And my counselor at one point deadnamed me in front of my entire class, and even worse they said Mr.   right before they said my deadname. And then when I told my counselor that I was upset about it they said ""I didn't know it was that big a deal"" like how you're a school counselor you're supposed to know these things.
You can still be transphobic as a trans person, the fuck they mean they can't be transphobic?
Thanks man, we need more ready to listen people like you!
People suck across all identity groups in various ways. Really sorry you are experiencing this.
I agree with you. But I think my comment may have came off the wrong way. There are those who are ignorant and those who are outwardly transphobic either actively or causally. And ignorant person is open to listening to the idea but doesn’t understand it and will mostly get things wrong. A transphobe is someone who hates trans people and the idea of transitioning. I didn’t mean to give transphobes a pillow if that’s how it came off. I meant to stop ignorance people have to learn. Plus my original intent for my comment was to convince people not to group all Cis people in a single idea. I have plenty of cis friends all of which support and love me. But I know cis people who are also viciously transphobic. But I know the difference between a transphobe and an ignorant. All transphobes are ignorant, but not all ignorants are transphobes. I just wanted to clear this up before moving on with my day. Also thank you for pointing out the flaws in my response. I appreciate the criticism so I may improve.
I try, that is why I’m on this sub
Yeah I used to sometimes hook up with cis guys but I’ve become a complete lesbian since transitioning (or, lesbian who’s also attracted to enbees - dunno if there’s a word for that)
Exactly. The worst thing is he didn’t believed I was a “real trans” because I didn’t had bottom surgery…
If I had a dollar for every time someone asked me if that's my real hair.
That’s the only part of me that’s fake. My hair. Oh well and my nails. But when I’m out I’ve had guys grab my breasts seeing if they’re fake ffs 😠

I’ve gotten close to a trans guy recently and despite the fact he’s been on T for about 6 or so years and had top surgery this year even his family still misgender him and it upsets me that he has to go through this 😢😞
I'm glad he's your ex. You deserve so much better.
I guess it’s just dysphoria at its worst
No worries, tbh it all boils down in the end to just respecting who people are and understanding it's only their right to know that, not someone with an outside POV. If more people actually got and respected this truth I think we'd have a lot less hate around.

Stay strong and I wish you the best 💙
Same. And also the boobs. I have encountered many cis women (mostly older) who seem so insanely envious that a trans woman can have nicer natural titties than them them and they get MEAN. So many people assume my tits and ass and curves are fake and I'm like no bby it's just hormones.
Oh there’s a whole bucket of reasons he’s my ex ! I only recently managed to escape the relationship and I am only barely starting to heal but the future is looking brighter
i cant even imagine how broken i would feel if i were in your shoes. you deserve someone who respects who you are, and im so so happy that you got away from your ex because he clearly did not respect you. if you choose to look for another partner in the future, i hope you find someone more worthy of your love <3
You are the first person, including friends and family, who hasn’t assumed I want a new partner in the future. Thank you, I feel so validated somehow lmao because I learned part of protecting my peace includes knowing I can tell someone to gtfo my house, and set all my life routines around my needs, and the needs of my dogs only. I have no interest in another life partner, at least for several years, because all the things I needed from him that he brought to the table are things I want to provide for myself now: comfortable housing, financial stability, family.  Idk why but it means so much to me to hear that it’s not assumed that everyone has to get back to being partnered as a goal."	zi6s9n	trans	483	0.95	2022-12-10 23:13:58
I was misgendered at work.	I was at work today and this lady with her kids  told them to take their books to the lady at the desk. ( I work in a library) I'm male to female and I don't pass yet so It felt great even if it was an accident. 😊	"Well then that’s not misgendering! :D
But surely you were correctly gendered. Not misgendered?
This type of situation is what led to my egg cracking to begin with!

I work as a department manager at a small family operated grocery store, but being new to a small town not many people really know who I am.

back at the end of 2020 I was sweetie'd ma'am'ed and she/her'd so much that I started to realize that I found it more than just funny when someone perceived me as a woman.
Yesterday one college mine at the taekwondo training called me ""her"" two times talking about me to a third one there before realizing the swaping

These moments are amazing
It feels so nice doesn't it ? Personnally doesn't happen with people I see too often and have spoken to (I have a super deep voice >.<) but strangers call me ma'am about half the time, haha
Secretly correctly gendered 😉
I've had this three times recently! Twice in one day! 

(I'm ftm and got called a man) 

I work in retail and often people will address me as ""lady"" but recently we've been allowed to wear shorts and I re-dyed my hair to a more natural colour. Since this women have been calling me ""man"" instead of ""lady"". Men still call me ""lady"" but the fact I've even been called a man once blows my mind! LET ALONE THREE TIMES!

I'm really happy.
Yay congrats!
This reminds me of a time at work a year ago. (Before I even discovered myself) 

A customer thought I was a girl and was blown away when I had to convince them I wasn’t. Crack up of a situation with the customer, but looking back how ironic, I never got annoyed at that comment
I thought it might be a sad story because of ""misgendered""
Wait hold on I need an clarification.


Are you're pronouns she/her? Or are they something else?
Mission failed successfully 🥰
When i read the title and when you said she called you a lady I thought you were gonna say you're female to male
Thats not misgender
I that's true for me haha I'm not out at work tho.
My pronouns are she/her.
We call this a ""male fail"". Congrats!
Secretly correctly gendered 😎
Ah okay i sorta get the post now"	t09465	trans	486	0.96	2022-02-24 11:48:55
Being misgendered? How does it even happen? Is this mostly an American thing?	"I live in Australia and I can't remember the time someone ***needed*** to gender me. Like, when I meet someone, or go shopping, there are no pronouns or gender words used at all. It's just ""Hey! How are you today? What can i get for you?""

Is this mainly a problem in America because all hospitality workers are required by law (under punishment of death) to call everyone Sir or Ma'am?"	"The US is very hierarchical, as such the older generations have passed down this idea that we must respect people with the use of Sir/Ma'am. You see this mostly with older people, but my generation simply calls people who look masculine: ""Man/Dude"" for women, most people will use: ""Ma'am/Guys"" to refer to people, as in the US, ""You guys"" is almost gender neutral. (That doesn't help if you are transfem and don't want to associated with anything Guy related.) The next issue is that there is a large portion of the US that does not like trans people, as such anyone (and I mean anyone) who even appears to have masculine/feminine features or seems trans, is more likely to have someone intentionally misgender the person.

As such it is fairly easy to be misgendered.
I live in New Zealand. I have been misgendered very occasionally,not for a long time now. It is usually the old boys that try it on. I give them back the same treatment that they give me. I'm a sixty-eight year old transgender woman. They usually get the look from hell from over the top of my glasses. Works every time. They usually apologize. I then thank them, smile sweetly and move on.
I’m a trans man in Australia and people misgender me because I look like a woman but once I correct them they don’t. I’ve genuinely never had anyone deliberately misgender me but they also can’t help that I look like a pretty woman with a curvy figure and neither can I so I just don’t worry about it.
I'm so confused by your question. There are a million contexts in which one can get misgendered.

""Have a nice day Sir"" is one of them, sure but...

""I'd like you to meet my son."" 

""This is Bob's girlfriend."" 

""Can I see your form, Mr. Smith?"" 

""Why is he wearing a dress?"" 

Like... do none of these things happen in Australia?
i mean service workers referring to people as sir or ma’am is DEFINITELY a thing and a super easy way to get misgendered but that’s not the only way. 

anyone just talking about you in your vicinity gives the opportunity for misgendering. i go to an all girls school as a transmasc nb (better education there) and almost every teacher addresses the group as “girls” or “ladies.” my family members use she/her all the time while talking about me. deadname is still on all my legal documents bc getting a name change is difficult, so any doctor i ever go to refers to me by deadname or “ms. [last name]”

people tend to make an effort to be polite by using formal titles (which is dumb and outdated anyway) but it almost always requires assuming someone’s gender. and that’s not even close to the only instance of circumstances where you can get misgendered
Pretty much. 

Employees are typically told to address customers as sir or ma’am. It’s rather old fashioned, and the country had been moving away from it for decades. However, the intolerant types love to use it passive aggressively in a plausible deniable way.
In Canada, typically we dont see sir or maam. But dang, call centres, or drive throughs with temporary foreign workers? All the time. I think it depends where you are from.
Its a country thing.
Australia has a very different way of using english, very casual. While in other places its way more strict. Also America in particular also has a lot of dicks, so it could be just on purpose.
i'm in america-- i'll occasionally be called ""miss"" or ""ma'am"" by service workers, but usually they leave it out in my region. most misgendering happens when i'm at work: a mom will tell her kid to ""give that to the lady there and she'll have us pay for it""; (to a coworker) ""is her register open?""; ""thank you, young lady""; (to a group member) ""she told me this product would be best""; etc.

basically any interaction that's not just between you and one other person has a chance of being referred to with ""she"" or ""he,"" ime?

i'll also get people point at my name badge (which has my very common and stereotypically male name on it) and ask how a girl got a nickname like that. over the phone, after my ""hello (company name) this is (my name) speaking how may i help you"" greeting, customers will say something like ""(name)? are you a man or a woman? you sound like a woman!""
A chunk of America does it intentionally and maliciously.
I’m in the US south so people aggressively misgender you and everywhere is hyper gendered, so what your describing to me sounds like an unrealistic paradise
it just happens in regular conversation, i got called sir grocery shopping yesterday since they often say sir/ma’am/miss or whatever to customers. tbh i never have this happen except for over the phone so it threw me off getting misgendered like that.
i’ve be misgendered by someone who’s talking directly to me, but most often i think it happens when someone’s talking to someone else /about/ me. for example if you ask a worker a question and they don’t know the answer so they have to ask someone else. “Can you help her find the eggs?” or “He says his order is wrong”. that sort of thing
I'm Australian and I work in healthcare where everyone is either ""sister"" or ""brother"". I'm not exactly out yet but I'm not subtle either and it sucks getting misgendered on an hourly basis. I can't really get upset about it though because as I said I'm not really out. Every once in a while people will take a stab at it and go for neutral with me. One colleague refers to me as a ""person"" and I've had store people referring to me with gender neutral pronouns a few times. Mostly in make up stores. I always appreciate the effort.

Edit: also I'd describe myself as fluid at present so some days I look very masc and others I look... still pretty masc to be honest but with make-up and painted nails. I don't make a very pretty woman. But the point is I can understand that I'd be a bit confusing to people.
I'm also in Australia, and I woke customer service

I've noticed customers (mostly men) being particularly insistent on calling me mate, buddy, son and the like when I'm wearing my pin

I'm used to it
Mostly people gender me in subtle ways like being called masculine things in ways that I *know* Susan from church will not describe a woman. But i get called ""sir"" a lot and people will refer to me using he/him pronouns in front of me which is exhausting. I have a trans friend who insists that it's polite or some people like it but I never do at the risk of misgendering someone who isn't out yet. I know how it feels and never want to put anyone through that, so sir/ma'am has worked it's way out of my vocabulary.
As an American, I get purposely misgendered. My boss also doesn’t allow me wear nail polish anymore. People at the supermarket will call you the F slur for wearing a pink T-shirt. I Fucking hate it here.
I work in a service industry and people go out of their way to misgender or make just... weird comments to me.

Like the other night i was climbing in a freezer, and two customers came up behind me and asked ""where's the peanut butter?""

I jump down and turn around, and the woman goes ""oh im sorry i thought you were a girl from behind!""

And it's like ma'am, keep it to yourself.
On top of what others have said, as a trans minor there's also a lot of ""oh, having a father/daughter day?"" kinda stuff that I've gotten when I go out with my dad. Now that my hair is short and I bind we get a lot more ""having a boys day out?"" stuff but yeah, a lot of older folks, if they see me with one of my parents, they tend to comment on it.
Pretty funny reading all these comments about American english being 'strict' when your language is memed as 'english simplified'
Aussie's are nice and don't misgender, because they're too busy fighting the roos, emus, and funnel webs.
If there's a group of people who all look femme/like women people will say ""Ladies"" or ""Girls"". Shit drives me crazy and I have no clue why people do it. But yeah it happens all the time
Yeah rarely do you go to a store or something and not get referred to as Miss/Ma’am/Sir. It always happens in the US for some reason. I didn’t realize this was different for Australians tbh
Usually it happens deliberately. People know full well that they could speak in a way that avoids gendered terms, but they know using terms associated with the person’s AGAB will cause them pain, so they use those terms. It’s a perfect way to cause significant harm to a trans person without a single cis person batting an eyelid even if they hear the entire exchange.
I live in a country where the main language has gender in every noun, verb, adjective, and preposition. ""how are you"" and ""is that yours""  both include the gender of the person you're speaking to, so it's really obvious when someone misgenders you or genders you correctly
In German almost any noun is gendered. 
Therefore, any title, profession, role or whatever is gendered. So yeah - since almost the entire language is gendered making sure that ppl at least perceive u as someone who prefers the correct pronouns is kinda important for mental health. 

In Russian it's not just a lot of nouns - but most importantly almost all verbs are gendered. So it's actually impossible to have a conversation without having to gender urself and others.
Im also australian, i do get misgendered but im very lucky its not often. Always after i speak.
It happens to me at work a lot. I work at a coffee shop so if I’m the one on the register and I’m handing them change and/or their receipt most people will say thank you ma’am/ sir. It’s annoying and I just don’t understand why people have to add the ma’am or sir. Just say thank you and move on. It’s also funny to me how before I started testosterone and wore my binder to work people misgendered me more. And even now that I’ve been on T for almost 9 months and I don’t bind anymore people don’t misgender me as often, but it still happens, mainly with older people though
I speak Hebrew, and literally every verb is gendered 🙃 (except first person not-present tense for some reason)

Talking without misgendering myself too much while I was closeted was like playing 4d chess
america imo has always been a very heavy on the gendering of people. I belive it’s because of how many words and phrases that are taken as respectful are gendered. terms that are more gender neutral are more used in more informal situations so i totally understand where you’re getting at OP.
In Australia the only misgendering is from people who knew me as a kid. Usually I think they are just being deceitful, but I find in general Australians tend to respect your identity, New Zealand too, never a problem there
I mean I'm Australian and there's a fair amount of situations where it does or could very well happen but I do think its definitely not as bad (for the most part atleast) here than in places like America and such
I’m in Sydney and apart from the odd slip of the tongue I can’t remember ever being misgendered since I went female full time. I have found that people in general are very polite and respectful. This has made me feel very accepted and very hopeful for the future.
Well Latin based language are super common, English isn’t the only language on the planet
As an American... we're taught to address people as ""ma'am"" or ""sir"". So someone will say ""excuse me, ma'am "" or ""thank you, ma'am "" and it's supposed to show respect and deference to the person addressed. 

Otherwise they just F up your pronouns.
Ignorance and not being considerate. That's the usual thing. Nowadays I just ignore it and not care. I just try and get through everything, my coworkers actually use my name instead of my dead name. Honestly that's the only people I care about using my proper name and pronouns, people who are close to me. It's not so much an American thing, it's just people being too stuck in the past and not approving of the change we all inevitably go through.
I live in the southern US and calling literally everyone “sir/ma’am” after practically every sentence was drilled into us basically since birth. It is considered extremely rude to do otherwise, so yeah, I guess it’s a cultural thing.
I'm American. My family has a habit of talking about me as if I'm not there even when I am. Besides that, my grandma says ""she wants"" ""he wants"" type stuff whenever we're in a drive thru. So she'll say ""she wants to have [insert my order here]"" or ""my granddaughter wants [insert order here]"". My parents often introduce me as their daughter but more recently they're going with ""child"" or something else more gender neutral.

I've also gotten misgendered on accident in a customer service context, but that doesn't bother me because a customer who's never met me has no way of knowing unless they ask.
The most i get is people using she/her for me, which personally isnt a massive thing. I have started wearing my pronoun pin to work (which one of my customers made for me) and i havent received a complaint yet, i get more compliments really. Maybe people might feel like certain words can be gendering, for example ive been called darling/darl' a lot but people use that term regardless of gender. Same with 'guys' (hey guys, hows it going)

Edit: Also, when leaving the store, customers will often say something like ""thanks girls"" or ""see ya girls"", which again i dont care about, since they are referring generally to a group rather than me personally. Although it was nice when some coworkers brought it up and asked if i was okay with that, felt very validating. 

We have a nonbinary regular (their wife made me the pin) and everyone is accepting, often dishing out compliments like ""loving the nails/dress today"" and my manager was talking to me about how shes excited for our regular to get top surgery soon. Most aussies are quite chill with anything
In french, we do have a neutral pronoun: iel. It is not use often yet, so in my language, everything is classify acording to i dont know who rules this but… a chair, in french, is: une chaise (une= a, but feminine version), a wall, in french, is: un mur (un= a, but masculine version). So long story short, you have to be classified as feminine or masculine and the pronoun change is quite difficult for us!
Happens all the time to me, especially at work when I have to wear a very masculine uniform.
If you don't pass in someone's eyes i find its pretty damn common.
Here in nz guys call everyone 'bro' or 'man'
Older people occasionally call me sir.

But yeah, doesn't happen most of the time when I'm in a dress.
i mean like most misgendering it’s usually something that happens to you because someone is talking  about you to someone else, not directly to you.
Well I live in Brisbane and I get ""sir""'d all the fucking time. And if its not ""sir"" its ""mate"". I figured its just the lucky young people who don't cop it all day every day.

If this doesn't happen to you - yay for you. It's not happening because people aren't sure what to call you not because you live in Australia.
Daily here (Netherlands) definitely not American thing.
I, trans woman in UK, am misgendered very frequently. Then again, I look like a butch lesbian with or without makeup on.

It doesn't really affect me at all cus Well, if some stranger calls me sir or ma'am or mister or miss or whatever, then it just means I know if I'm passing as a woman or not. I don't take it to heart because, how could they know?

For people that do know me however, it hurts if they misgendered me accidentally, but they often correct themselves very quickly. Only once has anyone intentionally misgendered me and it blew up in their face massively. I didn't speak to them for a month straight until they had the balls to apologise.
Highly militarized societies are also heavily gendered.
Happens a lot at work--
""Hey can you hand this to him"" ""yeah jaycie sits there you can take the desk behind him"" etc etc

Happens in like casual environments-- guy at party was recounting a sick shot I made in beer pong, used he pronouns in the story etc

Someone introducing you, ""this is jaycie, he is my brother"" etc

Idk pronouns get used a lot in tangential situations where they are talking about you but not to you
As a french person, I wish my language wasn't gendered.
no matter how many times I use he/him pronouns when talking about my bf, our neighbor never stops misgendering him. She says she's just stuck in her ways. I think she just does not care much for ppl. (She's a horse farmer, rly loves the horses)

Is transphobia generally not a problem in Australia? thats nice!
In italiano 99% of the words change with gender not just pronuns  so no, it's not mostly an american thing
I'm in France, most cashiers have to greet customers in a gender way, it can be seen as rude if they don't do it. Their boss will also tell they have to do it.
 
Sometime they don't do it when they not sure but it's uncommon.

It' the same thing when we have a phone call, I still never pass on the phone after 4 years or T.
Idk about the US, but in the UK people seem to love gendering everything. Like, everywhere non- queer that I go with my girlfriend, they say ""Hey girls/ladies"". Totally unnecessary :/
The place I see it most is when people talk about you in your presence, which happens a lot more than I used to think (of course that means they're doing it behind your back too).

Introductions are the worst though. Get misgendered there and the course is set for another person to misgender you as well.
I'm usually misgendered by customers, but I just stuck a ""she/her"" thing on my name tag. Haven't been misgendered since. There is a difference of some people will purposefully misgender you i.e. radical Christians being the main portion.
Us here. Had a biopsy done at my local oral surgeon and he walked in the room and said “there it is, how are we today” now, I’m pretty used to getting misgendered I’m over that whole thing it’s a waste of energy to get upset about but this is the first time someone’s called me an it like to my face I was taken back a bit but didn’t say anything 😒 like oh well
guys, America is more tolerant than most of the other countries. you're aware, right? /neu
Europe will turn into the U.S. with immigration
I'm laughing but also I want to live somewhere where things aren't constantly gendered, it would make things so much easier.
It happens, but also it doesn’t because most seem terrified because in the western world it’s almost like life and death for them, wrong word and bam, lost the job or something else, the ones that go with every possible route to avoid any kind of sexuality in talks, I feel they fear it because something really negative can happen from a simple mistake. 

I look at it as they are just another species, they might have an idea or none at all, know about it or not, or those on a spiritual level that don’t recognize it. But if they are being kind, not rude or trying to be intimidating or insulting in any aggressive manner, I think of it as another species showing kindness towards another, and if it gets brought up I’ll say it but I won’t impose my will to make them feel shitty for showing genuine kindness but they said one thing wrong on a list of many. 

But if you being an asshat I’ll kindly just ask “ if they are done “ I find showing zero shits is a bigger slap in the face than throwing shit at the face 😅
I live in Canada and I do pass in a lot of ways but i still get misgendered. I use he/they and no one will ever use they so good luck being nonbinary because I know that sucks. Anyways for the most part I get treated like a guy I think its when I dress a little more fem or someone I know from before I transitioned it talking to me.
That's English mate, you rather don't want to speak Czech, which is an absolute hell, especially for non-binary, because even though we do have neutral gender, it can't be used for humans.
I recently got a lot of confusion from the employees at a clothing store when I tried to use the men’s dressing room. They told me to use the women’s.
I'm American but I only get misgendered online technically since im mtf and currently transitioning I don't feel like I'm at the point where calling me by my dead pronouns is misgendering because I still look male
Maybe when you look super young?

I'm also in AUS, don't get misgendered anymore but it's usually just ""sir"" or ""mate"" instead of ""ma'am"" or ""miss""
english only marks gender for third person pronouns. misgendering mainly involves those, as well as slightly less obvious things relating to gender roles and epithets
Yeah everyone feels the need to call me whatever pronouns they deem fit me. It's super often too. It's wrong pronoun this wrong pronoun that and now that I suddenly started paying more attention to how often people subconsciously gender people all the damn time I'm starting to get really irritated by it.
In Russia people usually gender you by referring to you as young man/woman, typically in shopping situation, but generally this is how you address a stranger
in my experience it also happens quite often in the non English speaking countries that have gendered languages (such as for example French). because there are different suffixes to verbes and adjectives based on gender
I’m in the UK and though I get the impression it’s worse in the US, there’s still a fair amount of gendering/misgendering here. Mainly more as a collective though, like the number of times a waiter/waitress has said something like ‘how are you doing ladies?’. There’s not a massive amount of sir/ma’am though it does happen with some regularity. I mostly get it at work though - when you are in a meeting it’s pretty common to use pronouns, ‘he’s working on the reports’, ‘I’m working with her on this’ etc. that kind of thing.
I get it all the time, I live in the UK. its a lot of ""you girls"" etc, despite me being a trans guy and my partner non binary
It's cus at least for me, it has always been so pushed to use ma'am and sir and stuff as a sign of respect so people who are working with the public and trying to be nice are pressured to go like ""can I help you ma'am ?""  ""Have a nice day ma'am "" etc.
It's definitely not an American thing.

I get called ""sir"" all the time here in the UK. Including this past weekend, when I was at a wedding in a goddamn ball gown.

Like, seriously, babes... I'm in a ball gown with glittery heels and my hair all done. If that says ""sir"" to you, you're either blind, stupid, transphobic, all of the above, or uncharted levels of liberal that mean that pronouns mean nothing to you and you use them interchangeably.
In France they are gonna gender everything, even our words have genders ( table is feminine for example). I’m trans FTM and I can’t even go to buy a croissant or a cupcake at the bakery without being called “Mademoiselle” or “Dame” even if I’m dressed up masculine af
Well it happens to me mostly because people do it on purpose to hurt you and also they do it behind your back and call you slurs. I need to pick my friends better in the future
I am often misgendered though not being trans but I feel it happens due to being a student talking to my professors or when I start a new year of college I'm always misgendered on first impressions even by random people I meet the sad reality of looking feminine as a guy unfortunately
I don’t really get that upset by it
French language terrible for that 😭
Yeah in Germany if I wear a mask (sometimes even if I don't) and don't know the person I generally don't even know what gender people see me as, at least until I open my mouth and speak. I don't know how I would measure passing unless I started wearing more fem clothing without other changes.

It seems a very American thing.
Well, misgendering can also be from people saying ""he"" or ""she"" or ""this wo/man"" or something like that. But yeah you're pretty much right.
So I live in Germany and usually there's no gendering either. When I go shopping for groceries, it's just ""hello, yes, thank you, have a nice day"". But for example, yesterday I went shopping and I forgot something at the counter. The cashier yelled after me ""hey, young lady! You forgot something"" so yea
There are language in which all the verbs, adjectives and even the word ""you"" and ""they"" are gendered

I get misgendered in my country every second word, it's awful.
0/10, not recommended
It's a thing in more genderred languages like Slavic languages. In Czech, nouns, adjectives, most pronouns and verbs are genderred (masculine, feminine or neutral gender but the neutral gender is used mostly for inanimate objects) so you need to gender someone a lot even when you're speaking directly to them (""Objednal jste si to?"" - ""Did you order this?"" - masculinum; ""Objednala jste si to?"" - ""Did you order this?"" - femininum).
Same here. The only time i get misgendered is by pronouns and its pretty easy to correct
The doctors say whatever is on their record of you
My name for example is teuntje and my dead name is teun im mtf and live in the netherlands
But my official name ( like a middle name but just a full middle name ) has the initials wca (lst name not included ) and the w stands for willem ( william ) and they either call me willem + last name or sir + lastname or they call me by my dead name

I hate it but no matter how many times they change my file it will automatically reset to what it was until im old enough to change my gender and name on my passport
The word dude and stuff like guys are complicated words it can be just a thing to make give your sentence more life or it can be like a reaction and between friends it can basically mean nothing and anything at the same time like your bro or friend but it will always have feel more masculine than feminine in some situations but please that shouldnt be an issue
This was what I wa stinking I just call people mate or g or their name and it’s fine
UK thing too

Happens a lot here…
As a French person, I got misgendered a lot because French is a very gendered language (like every Latin language I believe). For example : adjectives are used with a different termination depending of the gender of the person or the thing it describes.
What….?
talking in groups / to other people like 
“omg so she wanted to …” or like “literally thats what she ways saying!!”
I live in a country where we speak spanish and it's litterally imposible not gender someone when talking.

In english you cuold just say ""They are my friend"" when talking about someone, but in spanish you can't say this bc there is no word for they/them pronouns, so being misgendered is really common here.
It's a product of a desire to be a victim.  In America, some, not all, but some people find comfort in being marginalized.  As we grow and embrace new ideas and ideology, we often see new members of our society emerge. They begin to demand to be normalized and accepted.  
In doing so they tend to create new offensive words and phrases.  
Pro nouns are the newest example. And to ignore a person's preferred pro noun is an offense that can cost you a job.  
Assuming a person is a man or woman is now rude and racist behavior.  Why? Don't know and don't care.   
I'm not participating in the debate.  Every new generation thinks they are the enlightened ones, only to be dismissed by the next generations bright ideas.  Sadly the newest solutions to life rarely work, have already failed in the past, or are just plain stupid.
The UK does the same, and it can be very very irritating. Luv or mate (at least here in the North)  depends on how masc or fem you look that day. I'm gender fluid so I'm okay with both as long as they don't fuck up the pronouns. But I would imagine for others it could be much worse.
Being in the south was raised with the “mam” “sir” nonsense but it made me so uneasy and as I’ve aged I’ve just adapted to “Y’all” if it’s one person and “all y’all” when its more than one lol. Everyone is y’all in these here neck of the woods 😏
hey just so you know combining trans people into one word kinda makes it seem like people and transpeople are different when really trans is just a word that describes certain people. I know you didn't have any 
ill intention but I think it's a good precedent to set.
Dude is also gender neutral. 

“I’m a Dude, she’s a Dude, he’s a Dude! Cause we’re ALL DUDES! YEAH!” -Famous Artist Ed.
[deleted]
same in italy, most of all because our words are feminine/masculine (ex. “i’ve gone” = sono andato/andata) so you must give a gender to everything and everyone to talk
Hell yeah, love it! What have these people said to you, and in what situation?

Also, just want to say that you're looking amazing for 68!!!
You outlived my grandpa who died last summer I wish he'd been healthier so he could've lived to 68
Damn, I got glares for having anything trans related and I want a trans themed Pokémon tattoo but I don’t even feel safe wearing a sweater with the flag colors onnit
What context do people misgender you in?
I can actually see the sir and ma'am thing not happening, there are plenty of places where being so polite is actually seen as offensive and fake
I think part of it is that English only has gender in the third person except for sir/ma'am and Ms./Mr. If in Australia, they don't use those words because the respect it conveys in America isn't seen as necessary, then someone would have to be talking about you in front of you in order for you to even know you were misgendered
I guess I'm more thinking about strangers out in the wild. If your family/friends/colleagues are misgendering you, thats a different situation.

>""I'd like you to meet my son.""

This means your parent is a cunt. The response is ""you can either be supportive, or you wont see/hear from me again"".

>""This is Bob's girlfriend.""

Similar to above. Set up healthy boundaries with friends. If you are hanging around people who are misgendering you intentionally, stop hanging around them.

>""Can I see your form, Mr. Smith?""

I don't think I've ever been called Mr. Surname. It's much more an American formality. People just call me by my name.

The only place I can see this happening is in a workplace. If you're being misgendered at work, go see HR.

>""Why is he wearing a dress?""

The only person I can imagine saying this is a small child. Do adults actually do this shit?

The worst I can imagine happening to me in Australia is people staring judgementally - or maybe some drunk assholes saying something.
yeah Ladies is super common from customers at my job and it drives me nuts.
Funny you should mention this cause I'm pretty sure I was told to and I still didn't lol
That's really unfortunate. I'm sorry y'all have to deal with that. The whole politcal climate in USA is so fucked right now. Emboldened bigots are scary.
The most common one is someone addressing me in public like "" 'scuze me miss, need to get by!""

One of my favourite cases was early in the pandemic, before I realized I was trans, I was holding the door for someone and they said ""thank you miss!"" Then stopped to do a double take and said ""oh, sorry sir! Everyone's got masks, and you've got really pretty eyelashes!""
I was thinking the exact thing😂
Also the damn heat 😂
The first time I visited USA I was so startled by everyone calling me sir. Like what the fuck, you're 20 years older than me, why are you calling me sir?! It was such a bizaar experience to be called sir by someone.
Here in Dutch it's this as well with ""meneer"", ""mevrouw"" or otherwise ""jongeman"", ""jongedame"". There's no non-binary equivalent of these in Dutch so I've completely omitted these words from my vocabulary. My senses go off like as if it's a new gibberish word when I still hear these.
This indeed. People think they can just throw in a ""bro"" in the conversation as a joke or something. I can get livid over the use of it.
Which country are you from?
Mmmm. I just started voice training today. Not being able to pass vocally is scary. Have you done much training?
I've only just started transitioning - and am still male presenting. I haven't had the opportunity to be misgendered yet. But with that said, I don't remember the last time someone referred to my gender in conversation or anything.
I got it very rarely but I see with other people that misgendering is very common in the Netherlands, and sometimes it happens on purpose as well. When that happens I'm first in line to correct others even when it's for other people (I notice that non-binary people are by far the most misgendered and unrecognized people here, and also I'm really sick of train conductors who admitted to outright refuse to change to ""Dear passengers"" instead of ""Ladies and gentlemen"").
EXACTLY, portuguese too, its kinda garbage lmao😭
The nonbinary Spanish speakers I know use elle/-e. I’ve gotten laughed at by transphobes for correcting people when they talk about me but it’s a good start
I'm in Southwest Scotland, so ""mate"" or ""bud"" are fairly common masc, and ""hen"" or ""doll"" are generally fem terms. I'm still buzzed after the first time someone called me ""hen"" and that was months ago, still get a big grin on my face when I hear it!
Yep, West Country here so I get ‘love’ a lot. On the other hand I got a “cheers mate” the other day and it made me happy the rest of the day
Y’all is a wonderful collective or singular form of address. 
I tend to find other collective nouns to toss out there to avoid gender entirely.

-How are you fine folks?

-Good morning, crew!

-Alright, team, let’s get this show on the road!

It’s just easier.
And then you have the old southern lady terms: darling, honey, sweetie, baby, sugar, I could go on. If you ever get called those by an old southern lady it feels like a warm hug
I’ve adopted friend instead of sir or ma’am.
Considering they only said it once, I think it was probably a typo rather than a turning-trans-into-a-noun kind of thing.
Good catch!
No it's not. The application of ""dude is gender neutral"" stems from much earlier arguments that ""mankind/man is gender neutral"" when attempting to preserve it in lieu of saying ""humankind"". This is just an appeal to defaultism. 

Dude is masc gender in origin and in effect. Most women don't use dude, and I do not feel correctly gendered when people call me dude. And I grew up with Good Burger.

Thank you for your kind response.mostly it is in the supermarket or a similar place. Usually the comment is about my hands and Usually broken nails. I play lead guitar in a band and also play a lap steel guitar. They spot my fingers and nails and automatically think that I am a guy. I have had all of my boy bits removed. GRS surgery a while ago. I did ask one if I could do a down trow so that he could be 100 % sure. He really did seam to loose interest rapidly. In my old life I was Chief engineer on an oil tanker for nearly twenty years. I have used to dealing with all sorts of people.thanks for asking me. Take care sweetheart, Laurajane from Taupo in New Zealand ❤️ 🇳🇿
Hold up, you wishing your grandpa lived longer got downvoted? Am I missing something here?
Where did you live? My husband and I are both trans and regularly go into the country etc and have never had any trouble. We are also a mixed race couple. He is from Dubai and I am Aboriginal.
And we do not pass. At all.
Usually calling me ‘she’ or ‘her’ in the context of a conversation or including me under the umbrella of ‘woman’?
Yes, it actually happens, especially in places like the Southern US. Yes, our citizens are backwards and outdated. We know. People aren’t just making this shit up.
My mom is supportive but still calls me he It's partially my fault for not correcting her but I also in her eyes probably aren't doing much to transition which is true but I'm also taking it at my pace
Damn. Fuck America, I want to move to Australia, now. LoL
I can deal with the fact that every living thing on the continent wants to murder me if it means the PEOPLE don’t.
Sadly, even in contexts where gender might never be mentioned normally, here in the USA people will often find a way to bring it up SPECIFICALLY so they can misgender a trans person. It’s an HR defendable barb. A way to take a jab at people like us that they can easily defend as “an honest mistake” and an “attempt to be polite”.

That’s if you can get hr to care
Thanks. 

How bad things are really depend on where you live. Im in a suburb of a big city. There are a lot of open minded people. 

I’m obviously trans right now. It’s kinda cool. The aholes avoid me, and the amazing people find reasons to talk to me. I actually live living in my part of America.
I'm from the US but live in Israel
nope. i really should because even with t i don't think i'll vocally pass unless i put effort into it
I’ve had a recent example where I was clearly doing everything possible to present female - I mean there could have been no uncertainty as to my intent - and two librarians kept discussing me as “this gentleman”, “he” and “him” constantly in front of me while turning to me occasionally to ask some question or make a statement that always ended with “sir”. Another day I was attending a tribunal hearing for a transphobic vilification case, the security guard knew exactly which matter I was there for and I was very obviously female presenting - along with some other queer observers - and I was repeatedly addressed as “sir”. I was having a bad day and replied with “are you fucking serious?”.
Happens every day I leave the house.
- hello fellow gamers
Lol
So true I adore southern ladies to bits
those are what i call people when i want to be endearing
ya I just wanted to get that sort of information out there in case anyone else comes across this.
Before someone says ""but man used to be gender neutral"" that was hundreds of years before what this is referencing
omg you're amazing, you look brilliant! I'm a teen trans boy so it's really nice to see older trans people interacting on here :)
People be weird sometimes. I miss him a lot even though he was kinda transphobic because he raised me when mom couldn't
Believe it or not- a tiny town in California.
You not correcting her is not a cause for it, and it's especially not your ""fault""

People take time to get used to different pronouns, that's right, but it's not completely on you, they can control what come out of their mouths for once
Which part of America are you in?
I see, interesting. I assume Hebrew is not only strongly genderred but also has differences depending on the group and number of people you talk about like in Arabic, does it?
This straight cis brand new dad of a trans teen appreciates the education that all y’all are providing! 🥰
Thank you. You are so kind. I think that you have got a lot of courage to be a trans teen. 💛 I was born the way I am,I didn't start my transition till about sixteen years ago. It was only three years ago that I had the courage to come out in public though. Myself and a friend have started a transgender support group here in Taupo New Zealand. We try to pass on what we have learned in our lives to people of your age group. It is hard being a trans person, we all need to stick together and support each other no matter what our age or anything else. ❤️ take care sweetheart and thanks for messaging me, it means a lot to me, Laurajane
Dam here is an upvote, what that got downvoted is beyond me😂
I think that largely in Australia people don’t care that much what you do unless you are being a creep or stealing shit.
True but my cousin corrects her and I don't
Phoenix, AZ. 

It’s basically the same climate as the middle of Oz.
Yeah, exactly
Thanks
Oh wild, I thought AZ was very right wing and full of crazies.
It depends where in AZ you are. There are two big cities. If you stick to the more densely populated areas, it’s sane. If you get out in rural parts of the state, it’s a bunch of yabbos."	zdmdit	trans	485	0.96	2022-12-05 22:34:51
This is the best hat ever and I feel nice, maybe with TRANS written on my forehead people will stop misgendering me 😅		"S N A R T
Where in the USA if you live in the USA do you live because I was nearly murdered for wearing the same hat when I first came out I really hope I'm not overreacting because bad memories but peoples safety is important
Seeing as I had to frantically check your profile to find out what flavor of trans you are, I'd say you've achieved androgyny. :P
I don’t wear ball caps anymore because they make me look more masculine. It’s definitely a safe pick to wear if your hair is even a little messy… Not sure if it’s winter where you are too, but I’ve been avoiding bulky coats because they *also* make me look masculine. So take that as you will!
just wait until you are passing and people, who would instinctively gender you correctly, see the hat and think ""oh right trans, so it's the other way around"" 😄
Snart rights are human rights! 😊
With trans on your hat people are likely to bully and misgender you more :(
I love this hat!! And I def need to know where it came from. My best bro dude (3 months on T now and living his dream,constantly discussing ""trade you this for this"" with my trans daughter) would rock it regularly. Share the supplier?
[removed]
You look handsome as heck, don’t let assholes get to you
Trans teens backwards is sneet snart
This is some backward thinking, but if someone is wearing a label that's says they are trans I would overthink and have a harder time getting the right gender...
Like if they look especially masculine then I would think, oh maybe they need the 'trans' hat to let me know they actually are female. You really can't control or account for how other people are going to think. 
It's a bold statement, though, and I applaud you.
[deleted]
Through my experience when people know your trans they try to play a hierarchy game, where they feel superior cause they are ""normal""
I've learned through time & experience that some people will be professional assholes & choose to be willfully dense towards you & not except the boundaries of their current society until forced otherwise by the book of law or by whatever means  NECESSARY.
This made me snart
Like King Cold?
Yeah I live in the USA. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. I consider myself really cautious, I only wear things like this when I'm in an inclusive space because I am still closeted. I live in Florida but I'm planning on moving hopefully by the end of this year to a really inclusive LGBT area.
Lmao you got me laughing hard, what flavor of trans I feel like a Kool aid packet. Yeah I hear that a lot. I'm ftm but haven't started T or anything. It's really just what I can achieve through clothes/accessories that kinda thing. Some ppl do know I'm trans and use my masc. name but still call me she/her all the time cuz the moment I open my mouth you can tell I'm a ""girl"". Hopefully one day I'll pass but for now it seems I've at least achieved androgyny.
Lol I'm so glad I'm not the only one! I thought ftm at first (looked like a stage I went through) but you can never be sure
Lmao no it's not cold it's literally so hot where I am. My hair gets greasy quickly it drives me crazy. So I like too throw on a hat when I feel my hair doesn't look the best.
Pom pom hats air the way to go when it's cold. Also, I'll just wear long sleeve es under a hoodie cause I never wear jackets either.
Okay but I haven't even started my transition yet, it's just a hat I thought it was fun
Lmao I didn't realize what you meant at first. I didn't think to reverse the photo so you could read it properly 🤣
Yes I already spoke with someone else, I'm going to be careful when I wear it. I just wanted someyhing that expresses who I am even if I can't wear it all the time.
Yeah I found it at Spencer's, they had this trans baseball cap and a trans beanie too
Yo so what kinda issues do you have in your life to actively seek out an lgbt sub just to be a prick?
I really just liked it and bought it. I was thinking less about strangers and more about the people I know in real life. They know I'm trans and use my preferred name but don't always switch pronouns and it's kinda annoying. I really don't expect the hat to change anything like how I wrote in the title. I guess just wishful thinking you know. Honestly I just thought the hat was pretty.
Lol thank you I appreciate it
I snarted too
Also where my brain went POG.
OK that's goid. I'm in south carolina but I'd still be really careful I was in a Ross clothes store wide open dozens of people no one even said anything to them just br careful
Also a Floridian, it can be terrible here, stay safe!
Voice has such a huge impact. Things you can work on is your inflection. Men speak more monotone and more from the chest. You can also train your voice to be lower without T. It just takes a lot of work, like how trans women do it.
Guess I'm hitting the mall tomorrow. We're all in Florida too! Desantis is a dick
[removed]
Thank you, I'm sorry we live in a world like this where we fear for our safety. But I feel comforted knowing you're looking out for me. I will continue to do as much as I can to stay safe. Honestly no one even saw this hat today I wore it at home alone. I guess that's why I wanted to post it  I wanted others to like it. But even if no one sees it it makes me feel better just wearing it.
Wow just wearing your ignorance on your sleeve huh. If your intentions were noble you’d put effort into educating yourself.
You are so right! That’s why we don’t change our gender, we adapt our bodies to fit it! Thanks for the understanding you’re so kind. Also on a side note my therapist is trans!
Okay but you are being offensive, my life has literally nothing to do with you and your crap attitude. I will make the decisions that are best for ME. You're not being helpful you're giving unsolicited advice on things that don't concern you.
Science literally stands against you. This isn’t 1970 anymore. Do some research
That's good and I hate it too
Thank you for sticking up for me, you rock 🤘
Don’t take it to heart young one, these people are just sad souls who have nothing better to do with their lives.
Don't see a whole lot of other south carolinians round these parts. Just wanted to say hi and that I hope you can get somewhere safer soon! I left just months after turning 18 and never looked back.
I know I shouldn’t argue with these people but sometimes I can’t help myself. 👍
I know I shouldn't, but the comment caught me off guard and while I try not to be I can be hot tempered. But you're right I'm not upset I just needed a couple minutes to calm down. All is well. I'm trans and proud no matter what anyone says.

Do y’all misgender yourselves as a punishment when you do something wrong or is it just me?	"Just kinda curious

Edit:

Thanks for all the kind words and people telling me to stop.  I know I should and I do it less than I have before.  I posted this in a moment of weakness and I wanted sympathy or for someone to tell me it’s wrong I guess.  I’ve slept and meditated since and I’m feeling much better.  I’ve been depressed for so long and for so much of my life that it almost feels unnatural not to be, but I’m getting better every day, this was just a stumble.  Thanks again all, love you very much"	"No, that sounds like a form of self-harm and I would try to break that habit if I were you.
I…never punish myself if I do something wrong?? Speak to yourself with love and compassion!
This sounds like mental self harm. It would be really something to bring up to a therapist. There are many much healthier ways to cope with mistakes.
I have done this in the past, and it was absolutely an unhealthy behavior. This is a form of emotional self harm.
That's kinda the only thing I don't question in my life, so stay away from doing that. So, no.
This sounds like a very unhealthy way to improve yourself as an individual.
I would consider this a variation of self harm tbh. That's not normal
prior to realising i was transmasc i had intrusive thoughts which would always insult me and call me a ""pathetic little girl"", whatever along those lines.

&#x200B;

it's not a good thing to do to yourself, under any circumstances. it's not a habit you should have, you deserve to be more compassionate toward yourself
No and that's not a helpful or healthy practice. Be kinder to yourself please.
transmasochism
Weirdly not anymore but I did when I was closeted
Never! I just say, “Silly girl!” And then forgive myself because life is way too precious and short.
This sounds like mental self-harm, I’d really advise you try to kick that habit if I were you. You deserve better than to get misgendered as a punishment! Literally no human being deserves to have their gender withheld as a punishment.
I haven’t myself, but I know the kind of thing you’re referring to. it’s very unhealthy, and a behavior you should work to kick.
i’ve never done that
If I’m in a bad enough place the denial and imposter syndrome throw a whole ass party at my expense. It’s a nasty habit I’m trying to break personally
I can't say I have ever done that
No, that part ofe is dead
No but I do refer to myself with my deadname as an insult. I associate a lot of things I hate about myself as my deadname. It's always felt so negative to me and brought on a lot of self hatred so I always associated it with that, while I normally think of myself as my chosen name. My deadname I'd neutral anyway so it's not neccasarily misgendering though ig? I never misgender myself on purpose though aside from for safety
I'm always a good girl so I never do anything wrong
Yeah I used to. 

I'm actually quite surprised that others have said no in such a high percentage!
I definitely used it as self harm and -10/10 do not recommend. 

Even if you've done something wrong, you do not deserve to be misgendered. It's the same reason we don't deadname celebrities who have pissed us off or harmed the community. It paints the idea that our identity can be removed from us and is only tolerated as a 'kindness'.

Please don't do that to yourself intentionally. The accidental ones will lessen as you become more secure, but that can't happen quickly if you are intentionally hurting yourself. Please
I don't do it on purpose, but i heard that what we usually call ourselves when we do something wrong it's because as kids someone would constantly call us that way and our brains just repeat it. Like when i make a mistake i would think to myself ""pendeja"", and then immediately go ""no,no,no,no. It's pendejo now""
No and that’s self harm.
No, the idea has never even crossed my mind.
No you should be kind to yourself. Have a cookie :)
I don't believe in punishing anyone for doing things wrong really, so I def wouldn't do that to myself. Moreover, the way you treat yourself is the way you're most likely to treat others, even if only subconsciously. Treating yourself with compassion isn't just good for you but it teaches one to be compassionate to the world as well.
No. A) punishing yourself when you make an oops (and it’s not the same as a situation like “I ate few too many cookies, so imma do some push ups to balance out” balancing kinda sitch) ain’t rad, and B) it’s gonna make you associate your dysphoria with making mistakes, probably ( I don’t know you personally, and I’m not an expert in those matters, so don’t take my word as such, this is just from what I recall about human pattern association). 

So no, I don’t, and I’m kinda unsure if it’s good for you to do it. You do you, obviously, it’s your life, I just dunno if it’s super healthy for ye.
That's just psychological self harm. Please try to do that less often if you can? You deserve love, especially if you messed up.
You deserve to treat yourself with more respect.
I never punish myself for doing something wrong.. I learn from my mistakes and improve myself. Be kind to yourself <3
Absolutely not. If I wouldn't do it to someone else I don't do it to myself.
I don't do that, but I do self-harm (I'm aware it's not good for me)
I don't relate but it has similar mind set to SH or eating disorders. It's definitely not a healthy thing, I thing you're valid and love worthy person please stop it can't be good for you
Yes but I am also aware it is a form of self-harm and stopping would be probably improve my mental health a little bit.
I do this and know that it’s probably very unhealthy but I genuinely do feel i deserve it
I really hope this thread spurs you to treat yourself better you deserve so much more respect from yourself <3
You are a smart and vibrant and beautiful person

Worship yourself and see the light inside your self
I used to do that shit, break that habit immediately, it's not healthy
No
That's definitely some form of self-harm.
The only times I misgender myself is in minds eye by accident, then I get really upset.
I do. It’s a r e a l l y bad  idea but yes I do. Dont do it. I do. But you shouldent.
I definitely did at first, and it was 100% self-harm. I grew up with huge divides between girls and boys, with girls always being unable to do things and generally inferior. It takes a while to get out of that mindset but it can happen. 

It helps to think of yourself as a completely independent entity, and judge yourself only based on your own values and morals. Good luck!
No, but I used to think in a similar way. It's not the best for your mental health, instead think of mistakes like this. Throughout all of history and time there's been more instances of someone failing and learning than succeeding and moving on. It's the human experience, figuring out what your capabilities are and what is just out of reach but with more effort can be obtained. The first ever lightbulb had hundreds of precursors, but miraculously it's still burning to this day. No matter how many times you fail the next one could be the best and last the longest, you won't know until you try again.
I tend to accidentally misgendered myself and then it feels weird being referred to by the right gender (which is sadly rare) it feels like punishment but it's not intentional
Oh dear. Stop that...! You're only hurting yourself, and possibly wrestling with some internalized transphobia. It's okay! Everyone makes mistakes. You're valid
Not intentionally but the voices (for lack of a better word) deadname and misgendering me and yell at me if I think too many times about making a decision
yes I do:’)
i do it subconsciously when i self deprecate myself 😭😭😭
Yep.
I do it all the time in my head to prepare myself, but not to punish.
Ayyyyyy *finger guns*
Only in my worst and most depressed moments. I even caught myself slipping back into old hoodies and realized I was doing a lot of negative self talk which was focused around me not deserving to feel happy. Fun stuff, I totally don't recommend it though.
Oh my god yes.  I do it to try and get me to snap out of doing whatever bad habit I'm doing... it usually works tbh
Everybody in the comments calling this ""self harm"" or ""a form of self harm"", I just want you to know this would technically be self sabotage/deprecation. Self harm is physical, self deprecation/sabotage is mental.
thats self harm. when i tried to do self harm in the name of karma i got a dandy cool tv show to watch though
I wanna say I don't but I do I also do on accident
I usually just don't sleep or don't allow myself to extra cookies..
you aren't quite the decider if you did something wrong (unless you like, killed somebody) and you never deserve to misgender yourself. hell I'd say you shouldn't even do it if ur telling a story, cause it just hurts you more, and you don't deserve that :)
I sometimes do it, because I hate myself
yeah
No don't do that! It's emotional self harm
no, thats not a good thing to do, lmao

i might call myself dumb or an asshole, as like, a reminder not to be those things

but the goal isnt actually to hurt my own feelings, pull your punches against yourself, damn
I never intentionally misgender myself. I won't be able to adopt my desired gender role by holding myself back with disbelief as a punishment. If I don't take myself seriously why would anyone else.
Not this specifically, but I definitely say some nasty things to myself. 

Just remember that it's the internalized asshole part of yourself just trying to say the meanest things it can. It isn't true. It doesn't really have a point. It's sort of a fear thing. Like a cornered animal lashing out.  

Please make it a point to be kind to yourself. It can be difficult, and you'll probably never stop completely. But it's worth it to stop being your own worst enemy.
I actually gender myself when I do something dumb by jokingly calling myself a silly/dumb girl. Don't try to punish yourself when you make a mistake though. Think about yourself as another person, would you punish another if they make a mistake? The answer is probably no, so don't treat yourself less than others. <3
I just curl up on myself and think of all the bad things I’ve done. Much better than breaking something that’s already really fragile. Aka my idea of my gender lmao-
Not as a punishment, more out of habit. Like, I've been under the impression I was a cisgender male most of my life so (without thinking) sometimes I'll label myself as male. Plus, I'm still not completely ready to come out of the closet to some people IRL, so, gotta keep this lie going for a little longer.
Definitely not. Speaking as someone who used to use physical punishment whenever I did something wrong, or percieved that I did, you should do what you can to not. Instead of punishment possibly rephrase it as ""I made a mistake. That's ok,  everyone makes mistakes. I learned from this and will be better able to avoid the same mistake in the future."" or something along those lines. 

Messing up is never a positive experience, but there's no reason for you to make it so much worse.
Don’t misgender yourself. Ideally be kind to yourself, but at least don’t invalidate your own identity
No, emotional punishment does not work
Please stop doing that.
bad dobby?
yeah.
Similar, I almost forbid myself my transition, like I’m not worthy of it.

Thank goodness for my psychologist, it’s happening less frequently.
Compassion is the only way.
I do yeah but not as a punishment
It’s addictive isn’t it. 

I would speak to a therapist about it, most will be on board with you
No not in the slightest
I do this a lot. Usually if emotions are just very low I spiral and will just barrage myself with tons of awful mean, transphobic shitty things. Really really wish I didn't...
Yeah all the time with no plans of stopping (help)
misgendering yourself as a punishment is too far
I will sometimes misgender myself in my own head especially when thinking about my past which is really weird.
i missgender myself all the time
please don’t do this! it wont help your situation :(
maybe subconsciously
I have before. It’s absolutely not a good way to go about things, and is a super unhealthy way of dealing with feelings of failure, but you’re not alone in thinking that way sometimes
I will verbally assault myself into tears.
I call myself a stupid bitch then carry on
Huh

nope, are you okay? <3
Why would you punish yourself?
At the beginning of my transition yes but not anymore
No, I'd rather take a note and not do it again. Then it haunts me at 2 am 10 years later.
I stopped after my sense of self-worth got better.
you okay?
Don’t do this to yourself! First off, no matter what kind of mistakes you make, not your nor anyone else gets to misgender you for it. Being addressed properly is not something that you have to earn through “good behavior,” you inherently have the right to it and anyone doing anything less, including yourself, is disrespectful to you. Don’t disrespect yourself.

Second, self deprecation is a hell of a snowball. The more you drag yourself down, the more you reinforce and strengthen those mental pathways and the more stock you put into the awful things you’re saying about yourself. You can’t keep mentally berating yourself like this, because instead of stopping yourself from engaging in bad behaviors, all you’re going to be doing is wrecking your self image and your mental as a whole will suffer.

Stay strong, stay safe. I hope things get better, sis.
Yes, all the time. When I do something good, I praise myself with a ""good girl"".
But when I BDO something stupid, like, forgetting my keys in my office. I am suddenly a ""pov'con"". In my language it means stupid man.
No but my step dad used to do that to me
You shouldn’t punish yourself for doing something wrong. Doing things wrong is how we grow as a person. I love things to go wrong. In anything I do, I would much prefer to lose than draw because it means I can learn from my mistake for next time. 
Misgendering yourself is just an unnecessary thing for something that is so natural. 
You are you. Don’t make yourself feel bad. Just hop into my dms if u need to talk. ❤️
I feel like im living in a between state im not one or the other so on good days i am what i wish i was and on bad days im the other.
Oh baby. There is no point in fucking up that you should disrespect yourself like that. We’re all human, we all make mistakes. Do your best to learn from it, try to do better next time, and own up to your mistakes. At that point you have permission to forgive yourself for shit.
I used to a lot more but I haven't for a few months now.  My wife caught me doing it a few times and straightened me out.  I still might say shit like ""I just look like a dude in makeup"" but I dont say ""I'm just a dude in makeup"" anymore.
i have this issue too if i’m being honest. I’ve started doing it less but i still do sometimes
I dis that et sometimes I do it again but less often
It's hard top stop it but I'm helped by a psychologist
Classic internalized transphobia
Exactli this. I used to mentally speak to myself “silly you deadname” but every time I would reply ro myself that’s no longer my name, but never as a punishment
You love yourself more than I love me
^ Most self-loving trans person

Literally couldn’t be me
horrifying
But then I’d never learn from my mistakes, besides I don’t deserve compassion
Interesting, I will bring it up then. I never really thought of it as self harm it’s just kinda how I should be treated
It’s not really to improve myself per se but just to kinda make sure I don’t do bad stuff again, and I don’t think it’s that unhealthy
Do I deserve it though? I personally don’t think so which is why I do this kind of thing
I was just thinking that. I used to before I even came out to myself. I would refer to bad mental days saying ""she came back today"" even when I wasn't aware that I was a trans man.
Yeah, my native tongue is portuguese which is also super gendered so I misgender myself constantly out of sheer habit. It's a whole process lol
How is it self harm?
I am compassionate towards others, I just tend not to be towards myself.
How is it self harm?
I don’t deserve to be treated better or be respected, but I appreciate the sentiment
Yes mine is very supportive but my depression is very complex and deep routed, and I don’t think it’ll ever leave
As do I. Sometimes I’ll look in the mirror and berate myself until I feel awful because I think I deserve it
Bc I feel I deserve it
I love you!
it can be you!
False, you do deserve compassion, because everybody deserves compassion.  I've been in this same mental loop of self-hatred and I know how hard it is to break out of.  

You will get there though, it will be difficult but one day you'll look back and realise how far you've come.
Think about why you think you don't deserve good things. What have you done so wrong that you need to punish yourself for? Being depressed? That's not your fault. Being trans? Also not your fault.
I mean… you can punish yourself, bit misgender you is self abuse!
That reads like withdrawing yourself your identity because of a mistake. Seeing how it hurts me when others do it to me. I cant imagine it being any healthy to do. Im not a therapist so just said out of intuition but it is genuinely said. Wishing you well on it !
Not do bad stuff again = trying to improve.
It is very unhealthy.
It's very unhealthy, it sounds like you're in a toxic relationship with yourself. Imagine doing that to someone else when they do something you think is wrong, or someone else doing that to you.
Hun if you don’t think it’s unhealthy, idk where to start other than with it is. This sounds like a really toxic thing you’re doing to yourself. Idk where you’re based but if you can, please go see a therapist about this kinda stuff.
there is no good reason why you *don't* deserve to receive kindness, both from others as well as yourself
Does it hurt to be misgendered?
It's punishing yourself by purposely telling yourself something that makes you feel bad. Weaponizing words against yourself is psychological self harm. And for me, it tends to make my depression a lot worse, to the point I just don't have energy to get out of bed or eat. It might not be a physical form of self harm, but it is still causing yourself harm.
Thanks, I love you too
I’m a dumbass, I see what you mean now
Yes
Okay, so misgendering yourself on purpose is intentionally harming yourself. Ergo, it's self harm.
In my opinion, self harm is when you physically hurt yourself. Since this is mental, I wouldn't consider this ""self harm"", something more like self depreciation or self sabotage.

Although I'm not very well educated on this subject(self harming), so if anyone has any opposing ideas or arguments, I'm open to listening."	ukokr3	trans	471	0.91	2022-05-07 22:57:20
(tw: transphobia) i tried to go into the woman's restroom in the local mall and a woman didn't let me enter	"Im a trans woman, i was in the mall with some friends looking as fem as I can, i makeup was all fucked up because I had cried already that day, on my way to the restroom a woman stood in front of the entrance staring at me with a hateful looking stare and when I tried to walk around her she stepped in front of me.

Now, i know i should have said something and defended myself but I was already feeling frail and also my voice does not pass and I thought it would make things worse, so i didn't say a word, she also didn't say a word, we just stared at each other, but since I really needed to go i put my head down and went into the men's restroom. Did my thing really quickly and went out really quickly, but the experience ruined my entire day, i went home devastated and kinda shaken shortly after.

When I told a friend (trans man) he got really fucking mad and wanted to go in there and make a fuss, but I think that would only make things worse and asked him not to do it.

I guess I'm just emotionally shaken, this has never happened to me and I feel it was very close to becoming a messy situation I would only get out worse.

Edit: Guys thank you very much for the support, it means a lot. To the people that told me to make a fuss or misgender her, i don't think that helps anyone, only hurt our cause.  I know i should have defended myself and just gone in buy I just couldn't at that moment, i was emotionally frail, but I will try to do better next time something like this happens. Thank you for all the love 💜🥰"	"See that's were i would have pushed past or if not possible but I'm also stubborn and set in my ways
I am so sorry that happened to you.
I guess some just like to pee on their territory and loudly hiss at anyone that comes within striking distance. It's irrational and those of us who see it for what it is can only pity how narrow their mind must be.
I'm sorry 😔 She was wrong
It's a REST room, we should be allowed to relax
Why is she guarding a mall restroom or assuming she knows your gender
Let the ignorance of others be the fuel to your fire, or brush it off and say, ""thankfully I'm not like that"" and just keep being your beautiful self.
Thank you for sharing your experience
Nothing a body slam can’t fix. 

I’m half kidding, but people like that are fucking terrible.
I would said dude. The mens rest room is over there. When she says ""Im not a man!"" Tell hey ""Oh? Your sure acting like one"" then dab on her like the hater she is.
This is literally my fear going to public restrooms that’s why I haven’t socially transitioned into female restrooms.
I don’t wanna be bullied or harrased by transphobic women (even if I don’t pass at all) but I also fear that male will hate crime me for looking hella femme in the guys’ restroom. It’s a fucked up situation and they don’t understand the position they’re putting us when denying us entry.
I’m so sorry it happened to you!
You know what, no one cares if your voice dosn't pass, tell her to move, it's not your fault u need to use the bathroom, people nowa days, if you still feel emotional about it, you can DM me about it and I can try to make you feel better 💗💖💝
Okay so you should contact the mall and tell them that another woman forced you, who are also a woman, to use the men's bathroom and put you in danger. It's not okay and it's illegal for a random person who doesn't own the property to force you to use a bathroom you don't belong in.

They probably have cameras and if you can give them the day, the time, and the part of the mall where it happened then they can probably identify the woman, ban the woman from the property, and help you seek police charges and/or legal action against the woman if you decide to do so.

Like she literally broke the law and put your well being in harms way. The only person who can tell you that you can't use the bathroom is the person who owns the building due to it technically being private property. If it were public property, such as if your city actually owns the building, then no one at all would be allowed to tell you you can't use the bathroom, not the police, the mayor, city council, no one, as your rights to literal public, as in owned by the government, restroom facilities are technically federally protected.
I would take a video of her and report her to the police. If police doing nothing, I would put it on social media. I have zero tolerance with discrimination but I totally understand that you can't fight each time. Having a funny thought right now: if I could piss standing, I would mimic the gesture and say to her : ""Would you prefer a piss on you? Your choice."" Just reading this makes me so angry. Sending love and support to you sister.
I would have confronted that woman.

Ally of transgender people here who isn't trans herself. I had a similar experience once, but not because I ever went trans, but all because my hair was cut short back in kindergarten. My mom had me dress up all girly, and this faculty member of the elementary school did not want me going to the girls' restroom that time.

I wasn't even transferring from girl to boy. All because of a pixie cut that made me look like a boy, I was discriminated. But I remained a girl even with the cut.

I have transgender friends at the university I go to. One of them went from girl to demiboy.

Edit: I forgot to mention that I have no idea why people have it in their minds that gender differences are shown by the length of one's hair.
sheesh That is really shitty. I'm so sorry that's happened to you. No one deserves to be treated that way. I hope that your really lousy day recovers soon, girl.
I'm sorry you experienced this. I'm glad your friend wanted to do something about it, I understand not wanting to make a big deal out of it and just having to pee. It awful and I'm truly sorry.
it sucks but you're not guilty in anyway you were involved in trouble and it fell on you there's just people that need to piss off others to feel good and they should grow up later
this fear (also cause I'm only out like a year and don't pass at all) is why I don't use women's bathroom
Let him throw hands for you. You would do the same for him, right?
Using the restroom is so scary for a lot of us ... And it's fucked up that it is that way... It shouldn't be that way. I'm so sorry you had to experience that... I've been in that position multiple times, but the opposite. Im ftm and guys scare the actual shit out of me so yeah.
Im so sorry this happened to you, chief. That person is absolutely horrible and they deserve only the pain they cause on others. Dont feel bad you couldnt react, I wouldnt have been able to either. I hope you manage to get over this distress one day at a time

One thing I like to do when a thing awful like this happens is use the 10 rule. Is it going to hurt in 10 minutes? Probably. In 10 hours? I dont know. In 10 days? I dont know. In 10 years? Certainly not. It makes it easier to remember bad things pass too
Break out your phone, record and cancel her ass.
[deleted]
I fear Exactly something like this to happen so i use inva-wc... and also im sorry it happened to you. Cis people are trashy most of the times
Well I guess it’s time for a staring contest
I hate when people act like that((( Like we are not persons at all(
[removed]
I'm so sorry that happened to you. Normally I'm the kind of bitch that will make a scene but I know what it's like to be in your own head and feeling some feels from something else and having that strip away your will to stand up for one's self. 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈 stay strong
Bitch would’ve had the right one if I was there because I would’ve fucking made a scene and made her feel really fucking stupid and let her know about herself
You should have pushed past.
Not sure of the legality but the karma result - her getting peed on...
Next time it happens just shove through
If we see this kind of thing happening, what can a cis woman do to help?

My first instinct would be to pretend like I know you and then go in with you, kind of like how one does when they're trying to keep creeps off of other girls at the bar.  Would that help, or would it make it worse?
Imagine being the person who goes out of their way to ""guard"" the mall restroom
Depending on the state/country she may have just committed a felony. Her ass could use some time in prison
tell me where she is and I will hit a bitch.
on a more serious note, I’m really sorry that happened to you. people can be so awful.
Ugh. That's really shitty. As if we need more shit to shadowbox in the shower about.

As a person who has been shy pretty much my whole life, long before coming out as trans, I get it. I am not very happy with my voice, and I definitely tend to limit talking to people in certain situations, especially when on my own. And in that situation, its like you don't wanna give that shrew any more ammunition.

Awesome that you have a friend to vent with and who sounds ready to back you up though! Keep ya head up girl!
So YOU have to go in the mens and feel uncomfortable just so she can do what? Thats fucking outrageous, you need to stand up for yourself!
I know i should have held my ground but I was already kinda shaken that day and just wants ready for any type of confrontation, i just needed to pee
kick her through the door into the restroom 😂 just kidding. but in my fantasy it is totally worth it
Reminds me of the little girl soccer player who was/is constantly criticized and her team was held from competing in some competitions because people thought she was a boy. People were wanting her genitals to be inspected by a physician to prove she was a girl. She's cis, though, she just had short hair.
I would and I kinda did before when a shopkeeper was harassing him with invasive questions.
If I may, she was acting very *jerk*.
Um...
Please know that I'm cis, but I had a similar experience back when I was a little girl.

And it was because of a stupid haircut. People have it in their minds that the haircut shows one's gender... which is stupid because I dated a man who wore a braid in his long hair.

(edited to add on to the end of the comment)
Im destroying cis women's rights by wanting to not be hate crimed? I see...
Hippity Hoppity prepare to be downvoted
I believe that would help, but I didn't have anyone to ask for that with me, i was the only girl in my friends group at that moment. My transmasc friend offered me this favor before a few months ago because he is early in transition but I don't think it's fair to him for me to keep asking, he didn't care back then because h still felt safer in the woman's restroom.
I really don't know, I'm not in the us
I'm not saying what you did was wrong in anyway and I'm truly sorry that you experienced it, and i hope you won't have to face this again (but i would say that i might have helped you to get your friend involved)
God I just want to give you a hug, I hope you never have to experience this ever again, if I was there I would’ve screamed at that nasty bitch. Virtual hugs you gorgeous lady 🥰🥰
There you go then homie. It can feel weird to let your siblings stick up for you, but they want to show you that love the same way you do

I love Ur choker, where'd u get it?
Your eyes and outfit are both super pretty! Glad your family's supportive. Hope your dad comes around soon.
I Love yours sweater !
Why is it so hard with dads? Mine is the same, won't gender me correctly until I'm 100% out which is lame imo. Hope both our dads will come around!
V pretty
Gorgeous!! (I’ve heard a spray bottle well as a misgender corrector. If you don’t want to spritz him, I’m sure someone else would be willing to help)
Woah! Those accessories make you look like a Victorian lady! Mysterious and elegant vibes 💕

Ty! Spent so long on this look, for the big reveal! 😅
Ty! 🥰
Well i appreciate you saying so 😌
Yeah, it sucks. Everyone I know was able to shift pretty quickly, and rarely refer to me wrong, which has been wonderful. (Even my 11 year old niece).

But, he says he is trying, so theres that.
Come now, no need to make me hopeful. 🥰
My same first though

I was so proud of my outfit, wish i had a pic of the full thing

Ty! Fingers crossed
Ty! One of many treasures found at goodwill!
Something something toxic masculinity and unfair expectations put on masc people. Idk, I hope so too. Best of luck to you!

Gosh. I love the idea but he would never allow it.

I feel that, I hope it gets better ❤ Hope his tries, grow and grow. On the other hand it is amazing that so many refer you right! That is truly amazing and beautiful 😍 Have patience it will come, if not it is okay to stand up for yourself. Lots of love!
I’m serious though, you have her eyes and mouth

"In girl mode in public for the very first time. Wasn't misgendered once. Waitresses said stuff like, ""can I get you ladies anything?"" I honestly wasn't expecting this. They were for sure being polite. I'm still absolutely ecstatic and this was a huge step for me, psychologically (28 mtf - 1 month E)"		"First thing,  you look amazing. Great sense of style,  amazing hair. What a babe.

Secondly, the weren't just being polite, you're a woman whether you think you pass or not. <3
I wish I looked this good one month in. It took me 6 months to figure out make up at all. 🙃 You look great!
Looking pretty validated over there.
You are beautiful! Seriously, I'm so jealous of your hair.

I don't think they were just being polite though. You look very obviously female. You sure af are one of the girls on here where I'm like ""how on earth did people think this person was a guy? Do they need their vision checked?""

Either way, I'm happy your day went so well! <3
Looking cute! :)
😘🌺🌹
Love your style
Gurl, you look fantastic!
💯💯
Congrats! Wish I had your courage! ❤️❤️
YAY!
I wish I was in girl mode but I’m still in boi mode
You are absolutely gorgeous my dear. Big love from a trans sister 💖
Well congrats on 1 month and that is totally exciting for sure!!! Congrats on going out as yourself for the first time. I know it's scary to step out into the light  but, as you do it more it becomes your new reality!
I am glad you had a good time being you keep 😊
Omg you’re gorgeous
Hey! How did you get your hair to look like that? I think we have similar types of hair but I cannot for the life of me make them look like I want
[removed]
Jeez, you're speaking truths. This was such a wild day. lol
Thank you! It's so funny how many ""jealous of your hair""s I'm getting. I've always hated my hair until like a month ago. lol

To be fair, I have a little makeup on my eyes and some lip liner on, and my face agrees with makeup really, really well. I can't wait until I've been on HRT for an actual substantial time.
Thank you! I was hoping so! Lol
What do you mean!? You're absolutely gorgeous! Are you saying you don't go out fem?
Thank you!
Yeah, hair like this can be impossible to work with. Go check out the reddit CurlyGirl. It's where I got all my info. For me, the biggest thing is to never ever use shampoo, use co-wash again. Also, never brush your hair outside of the shower. Only brush when there's conditioner in it. There are some other things, but those are the main 2.
Finally! I keep hearing about people commenting stuff like this. It was giving me anxiety waiting for when I'd get my first. lol
Curls are mean to the owner of the hair. I have curly hair too, actually - but my hair is more like feathers and really light and it just likes floating around more than looking good. It's not even frizz at this point. I feel like my hair just chooses to be an asshole unless I spend a LOOOONG time on it and work with tons of product.

Also, I'm 23 years old and AFAB, and a month ago a retired teacher told me I should be ashamed of myself for skipping school because I wasn't wearing makeup. 

I mean, I actually am in school, but 1. I wasn't skipping, and 2. She thought I was 14. 

I am 180cm tall.

Makeup is seriously my saviour. 

But I think with you, it's more your bone structure that makes your face look so feminine. You're really pretty.
Almost never. Live in a town with a relatively small LGBT community. Moved here a couple years ago have have like no friends lol.
Omg thankssss I tried co-washing earlier and my hair is already seeming get in order instead of being a frizzy mess
[removed]
I didn't even know I had curly hair until a month ago. My hair was always just frizz. Not a single curl in sight, just unmanageable straight frizz. Then I was told to stop using shampoo and never brush my hair unless it is sopping wet and has conditioner in it. I've been doing that, and now my hair looks like this. Gel and hairspray help to keep it from frizzing out throughout the day, too.

I love makeup so much. lol I think you're half right, because without makeup I still get ma'amed as long as my hair is down. If it's up, usually not. But still, I get ma'am sometimes in total boy mode. The makeup makes it to where I don't get sir'ed at all.

Thank you so much for the kind words, btw!
Wow, that blows me away. You're so prettyyyy. Have you considered moving? I plan on it when I get the chance. I live in a rural town.
OH I thought of another important thing. When you get out the the shower, don't viciously rub your head with a towel. It ""disturbs the curl."" Instead, take a clean tshirt (I bought a pack of plain white tees for just this) and squeeze your hair until it's not sopping and let it air dry. You can use a blow dryer if you have a diffuser, but if not, just air dry.
You dont want to use a towel because they're too absorbent. 

All the other stuff, like kinds of shampoo to use, and use of hair gel to maintain curl, is explained THOROUGHLY on CurlyGirl. Trust me, its amazing info.
Enlightening. lol
Yes! Lease is up after April! I may have to move close to my parents who are in poor health... But I'm likely going to head far west and start over from scratch. Scary, but also thrilling to think about.
I'd like to move West as well. I'd like to move to Cali, but you always hear that you have to be rich to live in Cali. Anything outside of Georgia sounds nice to me. lol"	eq7yz4	trans	450	1.0	2020-01-17 22:55:30
How do I deal with my coworkers who misgender the new trans hire?	So far I’ve just resorted to aggressively correcting them, but I think I came off as a prick because they just talk about him in a room where I can’t hear now. What are things you’ve done that have stopped people from misgendering?	"Report them to HR for discrimination. If HR is competent at their job they'll give all of the people who are misgendering him a stern talking to and a write up because if they don't the company could be hit with discrimination charges among other things.
My habit has always been to document the date, time, who said it, and the words they used, and after three occurrences, I take all of that information to a supervisor or HR rep. I don't even engage with them directly. The kinds of people to run their mouths about trans folks behind our backs but not to our faces *know* they're being shitty and unprofessional, but they don't care, think they are justified, and absolutely won't be convinced to at least stfu until they face real consequences for their behavior. As that is the case, I borrow from Robert Heinlein who is quoted as saying:

> ""Don't try to teach a pig how to sing; you'll waste your time and annoy the pig.""

They can just have consequences for their bigotry. They don't need to know who's listening and ratting them out.
HR,  this is unacceptable behaviour anywhere, let alone in the workplace.   People should be safe going to work, not have to worry about being disrespected.
Given what you’ve said about type of job you’re working at, please use caution and communicate with the new hire before you act on his behalf. You may end up getting him fired just so the boss doesn’t have to deal with the complaints. Even with employment protections for trans people, he’s still a new hire and the boss can honestly probably fire him without giving any reason. Please talk to the new guy, tell him you will support him however he wants, offer (but don’t push) the ideas shared here about contacting the state. All this guy needs is to get fired from a job and have that much harder time getting the next one.
Tbh, sometimes I find that people respond better to quiet but clear disapproval than outright aggressive correction. Sometimes the aggression throws them on the defensive and convinces them that they're the victim, or they take it out on the trans person later. But seeing their peers seemingly holding back disgust at their behavior, calmly correcting them but with clear disappointment and discomfort at their behavior like they should really know better and are being immature and rude, and distancing from them or refusing to engage with that behavior sometimes shames them into cooperating. Be consistent, and a bit firm, but not necessarily aggressive or they start going all ""oh pronoun attack helicopter!!!"" about it. You want to make them feel awkward and embarassed, like they just ripped a massive fart during a meeting or made an off color joke and none of their friends laughed just shifted awkwardly because it was rude and not funny.
Document it.
I am trans and I work with a lot of trans people too. I'd rather not have another person aggressively correcting my coworkers for me. I'd offer to be there to help them if they ever need help. Be a safe space they can come to when they need to feel another person who understands them. 

At my company they claim to be trans and LGBT inclusive, but only recently have they provided a gender neutral bathroom (located all the way in the back of the building so you have to be a full blown employee to have access or just be willing to walk all the way to the back of the building to use it). We also have gendered locker rooms and you HAVE to pick a locker room to put you stuff in in order to enter major areas of the building. 

I'm trans masc, but very female presenting, I have long blue hair, I'm 6 ft tall, and men find me attractive. I'm terrified at the idea of changing in the men's room and using the men's bathroom. I work with a person who is trans femme, she uses the women's locker room and the men's restroom sometimes. I told my sister I'd be there for her if she needed me to talk or to protect her, I never push her to speak to me and I love her and treat her like I would want to be treated. My wife also supports her as well. I also work with another trans masc person who also used the women's locker room and the women's bathroom or gender neutral bathroom when it's available to us. 

I would ask them if they needed help verbalizing what is happening to them to hr. Where I work, you can take a buddy to hr with you if you need it, you just have to be willing to get involved and to be on paper when they write it up. Lol SPOILER ALERT, I'M THE BUDDY 🤠😂 

Just be there for them as best as you can, and don't assume they always want someone there to correct the other people. That's my best advice to you ❤️
State Labor board.
This is illegal harassment and you should be telling HR, and they should be thankful you're coming to them and not the new hire with a lawsuit
misgender them all. constantly.
Is it really a bad thing to come off as a prick to a group of bigots?
Oof, my coworkers try but they still misgender me a lot.
I haven't said much because I don't want to come off like ""an angry, petty enby.""
But the truth is I could gentle correct them a few times and see how it goes.

Have you asked them why they keep doing it?

Like ""Why do you feel the need to do this when you know better?""
I’d say keep doing what you’re doing. Keep referring to him as he/him and his preferred name and then maybe just act dumb whenever someone tries to misgender him. 
They say ‘she/her’ or a deadname, just be like ‘who? Never heard of that person’ forcing them to use he/him or their proper name?
It's a crap situation, and it sounds like you're in a hard spot to try to help. If honest just get to know him, make sure that they have an ally that they know can be counted on. Life is hard being trans, if they are someone you actually get along with, find out what's hard avd see if your can make it at all better. For me the most scary place at work is normally the bathroom, for a transman, I can only imagine if he's in there and those jerks come in. (Want to cry? Watch 'boys don't cry'😭)

The best help you can do for them really other than this, would be to start keeping a log of every time you've heard things said. Depending on where you are, there may or may not be legal protections, on a local level, if there are legal protections, your journal will be incredibly helpful to thier legal counsel. 

I also just want to say thank you for caring, decent and kind people like you keep people like me alive on the hard days. Bad situations are so much more brutal when you have to face then alone. 💜
Who knew I’d find more fellowship in this sub than my entire 1.5+ years of working at this fucking store?
HR will be happy to hear about it and bonk them :) 

No one wants an asshole in their company. It simply ruins the workflow and moral
Report to HR and a supervisor. If that doesn’t get it corrected, file A Title IX complaint.
It's important to get this person's input on what he is comfortable with you doing. He may want you to just leave it alone. Fighting it can sometimes just make things worse for the person. Or he may have other ideas of what would be supportive.
Just correct them loudly
I saw that you don’t have an HR, and good on you for sticking up for them. Another thing I’ve found helpful is pretending that you have genuinely no idea who they’re talking about until they gender the person correctly. 

Also just supporting your trans coworker and being there will make a huge difference. Unfortunately, we deal with shitty people everywhere we go. Having at least one ally can make it a lot more bearable.
Murder.

What it comes down to is ass holes are just ass holes and they won't change and you can't kill your self trying to change them. You can let them know your not comfortable with it which sounds like you've done that, and treat your new employee just like every one else.

My store manager pronounces my new name wrong constantly even though I told him to not say it that way.  He also refers to em as him constantly to other people and around me.  Great times.  I'd talk to whoever your co workers boss is.
If you’re HR fire someone and then say, “who wants to try that again?”

Edit: Just read you work in a butcher shop. Cut off one of their fingers, hand it back to them, and then say what I told you to say up there

Sabotage your workplace and flee as soon as possible. Bonus points if someone gets injured.
Social media smear campaigns
I get it.  I hear you.  

I’ve got assholes at work who talk about trans issues at the water cooler.  I’m gender variant and have never said I’m trans to a colleague but it’s obvious I am not the most masculine-presenting man.  

I know from dropped hints and snide comments that they are sure I’m gay and yet I’m married to a woman. I can sense I puzzle some of them, they want to suss me out.  I let that go because I don’t owe them any explanation.  

I’ll start  HRT in the next 6 weeks and a part of me thinks it is none of their damn business knowing intimate details of my life, why I’ll have  lost weight and grown breasts, or helping them “just understand.”  When you’re a mensch, you’re a mensch even without understanding.   

I ponder whether I owe anyone there some formal big pronouncement.   Yet they stand in the lunchroom and laugh and debate “transgender” an issue they know fuck all about.   Like I have the decorum not to stand in the lunchroom and not spout my opinions about menstrual cycles, pregnancy, and menopause — I don’t have those experiences, I never will,  so I don’t have an opinion — instead I am curious to just listen and have some empathy.  

I’ve been in this job now 32 years and built myself a darn sweet position in my field that I know is envied by others in my area — it’s a niche position that pays well and affords some travel. I think I’m safe but the HR Director is a conservative country girl tho uses the word “retarded” and is offended when called on it.  

So here I am around a gaggle of sometimes-assholes I can’t control or change so what can I do?  

I work hard, I am a team player, I am generous, helpful, kind,  I smile and am funny, I can also laugh at myself. I am going to shine so brightly, they may just begin to realize how wrong they are.  And the fact is, every one of them have redeeming qualities; most of the time I like most of them.

Maybe I’m being too generous, all I know is that being combative won’t win friends and change minds.  What changes minds is taking the opportunity to show people that trans people are just people and to just do my job to the best of my ability.
Engineer accidental industrial accidents, or like hunt them and eat/ correct them
steal their liver :)
You work in a butcher shop? Squirt them in the face with a water gun full of meat juice and say ""NO"" each time.
Suddenly, be off the opinion that your co-workers are not men because they lack even basic decency. It's your right to have that opinion and treat them as such.
For anyone who is bullied it is important to not let them stand alone. Bullies succeed because of the silent complicit majority. As soon as one person is standing with the person who is being bullied, more will.
never had this issue, but i would start misgender them so they know how it feels be be treated without respect.
And if they complain, just block their complaints with ""Nah its not so bad, its just a joke"" or something.
Correct them every single time. Don't have to be aggressive, just not to come off as rude unless they're doing something especially bad. Let that person know you're by their side, and you support them.
Can’t really stop it, you can educate or whatever but if a person is gonna be that ignorant , then there gonna be that ignorant , that’s why they went into a room to talk about it,you can report it but if that dosnt work, then all you can do is keep standing up for him and let him know what’s going

When a coworker was angry at the e-mail-signature pronouns, I sent an article talking about reducing suicide rate of trans children through acceptance and asked him to reconsider. Making sure those people know, that they are actively raising the suicide rate of CHILDREN should make them shut up or show you that they are actually trying to hurt them. In that case, they will need a new target after your coworker quit and I suspect it will be you, since you said you corrected them aggressively. Be ready and we are here not only for each other, but also for our allies who are looking for help.
There is no HR department. I work in a butcher shop with less than two dozen employees.
The attitude is that everyone is entitled to their opinion, so it’s perfectly acceptable to refer to him as a woman. I seem to be the only one with any knowledge of trans people and thus, the only one disgusted by this concept.
This. This. This.

Because either the bigotry will be kept to themselves, not knowing who ratted them out and thus starting to be careful around coworkers, or they'll continue and get fired for it.
THIS
Don’t have an HR department. I work in a very small business where the attitude is that entitlement to opinion makes it acceptable to misgender.
Yes, of course. I want to deal with this issue carefully. Thank you.
I understand that and it was honestly my first thought, but quiet disapproval does not work when you’re the only one who cares and are up against people 3-4 times your age. My goal is to denormalize this transphobic behavior, but I feel so powerless to do so in this social space. I think I’ll print up an informative document or something, putting my issues into clear and concise writing.
Thank you, I will. I realize my initial behavior is potentially harmful; This thread has been very helpful to me. Best of luck to you!
The thing is, they don’t really understand the nature of their bigotry; It’s just a fact of life to them that sex and gender are synonymous and every attempt to change that in their minds is met with confusion. If I come off as a prick, my ideas are those of a prick and thus, dismissed.
They don’t know better. I’ve explicitly explained how sex and gender are different and gotten confused looks. When I’ve been asked, “Does she have a vagina,” and I say that’s a nonsequitor, it’s brushed aside. These people, without much, if any, malice, can potentially do so much harm and I can’t get them to understand that.
I appreciate this, but honestly don’t think it’ll be effective.
People are often puzzled by my persistent respect and high regard for trans people, but when I come to this sub I’m reminded why. All of you are so wonderful and supportive; I’m honored to fight for your rights.
You sound quite stupid. You are basically saying that the person who is being called the wrong pronouns should just not care. Damn, if only it were that simple.
How mature. I’m only 18, so most of my beliefs are based on nothing but principle and how my gut immediately feels about something. I’m quick to disregard my coworkers as pieces of shit, but I know deep down they’re just uninformed. Being subtle didn’t work, being loud didn’t work, and here I am. It makes me really somber that someone like yourself who’s agreeable and has a good work ethic still gets shit just for being themselves. Makes me afraid to tell them that the gay jokes are real or to try cross-dressing. However, I’m also inspired. Your mere existence is inspiring to me. Knowing that you’ve persisted for 3 fucking decades in a workplace that has proven its potential for harassment and overcome all the challenges that come with that to end up being at peace not with them, but yourself, is wonderful. I’m more than happy you’re gonna start HRT (my best friend just started too so I’m gonna be getting firsthand accounts) and know this: YOU. DON’T. OWE. THEM. A. THING. People at my workplace assume that not being a dickhead means I owe them something, but it doesn’t. These people understand the workplace to be hostile, to be somewhere you want to leave and forget about when you go home. I want to change that.
Jeez, that sounds toxic.  Like they can make up rules about anything that suits them.

Is there an LGBT committee or advocacy group where you are?
And have you told your trans coworker or asked what he wants to do about it?

I would love to have someone like you as a friend.
Talk to the owner warning them of the potential legal troubles the bad actors could cause them. Do it in writing such as email or text messages so you have evidence of the report in case of retaliation.
The fact is he's a man. No opinion can change that. Dehumanization is illegal under most work laws and charts of rights.
I mean, everyone is entitled to their opinion. Doesn’t make those opinions correct. One is entitled to think the earth is flat and the sky is puke-green.

One is not entitled to express all of their opinions, especially when those cause harm. This is one that causes harm.

Also, one is entitled to their opinion, but not entitled to not be corrected about their wrong opinions. They have a “right” to misgender the guy, and you have a right to tell them off about it
>The attitude is that everyone is entitled to their opinion

The fact that he is a man is exactly that, a fact. His identity is not up for debate and never was. You and him should make this clear to your coworkers and that him being a trans man is not a choice, and he only chose to transition because his choices were that or be miserable with being seen as someone who he isn't and be stuck in the wrong body.

&#x200B;

No one's opinion gets to override someone's gender identity - that is for that person and that person alone to declare because none of us live in his mind.
in that case you can be entitled to your opinion about them being women/men.
They're still subject to state discrimination laws. This is not a free speech issue, and that conflation in the work environment tells me right there that you have a bigoted business owner. *That's* the core of your problem, not the staff -- they're just a symptom. If you find that a small business employer is not responding appropriately to documented reports of workplace bigotry, document three conversations you have with your leadership that are resulting in enabled bigotry and report them to your state's labor department.

This is absolutely important enough to merit someone losing a business over. The alternative is that we have trans folks who regularly have to bounce around jobs trying to find somewhere that doesn't make us hate ourselves and the world. Additionally, businesses impact their communities and carry with them a certain level of implied social responsibility in the form of, ""If I want to stay in business, I can't be shitty."" If the state labor department doesn't do anything about it, forward all of it to the ACLU and the most liberal TV station your area knows.
misgender them and say it's your opinion when they confront you about it
Yeah this. 

I think as a general rule the best way to advocate for someone's pronouns is to use them correctly whenever you can (which it sounds like you're doing). When your co-workers misgender him just use his pronouns correctly back to them. Ie ""where is she?"" ""He is in the back."" It's correcting and advocating without being confrontational. 

If you want to go one step further and do that ""you mean he"" when people say ""she"" I'd check in with your coworker. I love that you want to do this but suddenly being the focus point of an argument can be really intimidating as a trans person.
Um. That’s a choice on their part. Anyone who is ignorant but interested in being a decent human being would be curious about the difference between their understanding and the reality of your coworker, even if they don’t ‘get it’. Your coworkers are instead choosing to double down. That’s bigotry. 

And anyone who ‘would have done the right thing except that x was a dick about it’ wouldn’t have.
I sort of get it.
My brother's mom calls me by my new name, but she can't seem to grasp the concept of nonbinary.

Not like she's failing to on purpose, but more like if you set a 90 year old person in front of a PS4 and tell them to find the screen captures.
Ah dang, well I wish you the best in figuring something out. If nothing else, this says leaps and bounds about your personality, and volumes about how bad your co-workers are
Don't worry about them,  just do what you can to support him and talk to him about what he actually wants. 

IMO it's is kinda a dick move if you're doing this without even checking if your co-worker is even ok with it
no need to be rude just because  we handle  situations  differently.  I prefer  to not let it bother me at all,  I know my gender and could care less what  others  think my gender is. 
  to me there  are no such things as woman things or man things so call me man woman she he I dont care it all the same to me.
Well, I stand up for myself by standing proud and looking them in the eye.  I dunno, I’ve always had my physical strength and been literally able to hide behind my beard for years.  I’m going to loose that and it is scary.  What I can’t loose is my dignity but I am looking at my life from the age of 53 and thinking I can’t live my life for other people anymore. 

I used to be angry,and reactionary, full of vim to fight and change people but I realized my best way to do that was to alter my attitudes toward them so as not to allow their idiocy to take up precios space in my head rent free.  

It’s kind of funny, i have one son who worked in a butcher’s shop when he was 20 and described that same machismo BS — i see it in most butcher shops.  My other Son is 18 and a fish monger and it’s the same thing.  He came home talking about how they were complaining about how Jews are always cheapskates and how much the manager resents them coming into the shop.  I taught my son to stand up for what is right by not engaging in that conversation and treating other people with the dignity and respect he also wants.  People say the same shit about Scots and the Swiss but in most cases, they’re not profiling and hating on them they way they do Jews.  Hell, let’s face it, one of the biggest money-grubbing, stingy, crooked, fuckers around is their poster boy, Donald Fucking Trump and with German and Scottish ancestry, he’s as orangie-white as they get.  

You’re right though some people are just pieces of shit.  I could go on and on and on about the shit I’ve encountered for having feminine qualities - even some gay men will throw shade on me for that.  The shit I’ve heard said about Mexicans to my face (I’m half Mexican)… and I live 45 minutes from San Francisco in a supposed liberal area.   Fuck them, I’m going to show them what a strong person I am and be glad I don’t have to live inside their consciousness - it must be a horrible place to exist being so ignorant and full of resentment and spite.  Maybe if they get to know me enough, their attitudes will begin to soften but that can take time - sometimes generations. No matter how far we progress the hate will always be there — the key is to keep it among a minority of people afraid to act on it.  

In his biography about his activism titled, Across That Bridge, Senator and Civil Rights Activist, John Lewis wrote:

“We in the movement decided to actualize our belief that the hatred we experienced was not based on any truth, but was actually an illusion in the minds of those who hated us.” -- Pg 25, bottom of the middle paragraph.
I’m not sure about any advocacy groups and we work in pretty separate areas of the store, so I don’t talk with him much. I’m not even sure to what extent his identity is trampled; I just know I felt disgusted with myself every time I heard him referred to as a woman and didn’t speak up, so I started to.
Absolutely. People were born to be free and should express that liberty to the fullest, but using your rights to infringe on other peoples’ rights is not a true expression of freedom.
In Canada they in fact would not have the right to misgender someone in the workplace. It was added as a human rights violation here a while back.
I like this. This is something I want to do.
Honestly, I don’t think that’d get anything done. I view misgendering trans people as a very juvenile practice, something a child would do, but they would see me equating that to their behavior as childish in itself. Like misgendering them is the same as using trans peoples’ correct pronouns; So ridiculous and without logic that only an infantile brain would take it seriously. In that sense, I think misgendering the cis assholes would only backfire.
The creation of this thread is reminding me how much I fucking hate my job. Thank you for this affirmation.
You don't seem to understand life in rural middle America at all. TBH it's an interesting form of bigotry in its own right funny enough, as you double down. 

You have to see the irony. They're just as afraid of you as you are of them, mockery is just the coping mechanism for both sides. They're just fucking stupid and have no good argument to make. 


People who are brainwashed don't know that they are wrong. They don't know what they don't know,  and in the case of trans topics specifically they do think they already know what there is to know.
You're an amazing friend.
Yeah. Like I said. 

And also freedom of speech never means freedom from consequences due to speech
Yeah, just covering my bases. I definitely agree that it shouldn’t be legal to do that (of course, purposely and repeatedly. Mistakes are made occasionally, and that’s fine. The problem comes when it amounts to harassment and comes from a place of bigotry). But even if it’s not illegal to do that, it’s also (usually) not illegal to criticize and call out someone for doing it.
Just remember that you have to go through the documentation steps I mentioned elsewhere with your boss first. In writing is best -- lawyers and judges *love* paper. If you can get your boss to show that they're enabling bigotry in an email, that's going to be the best evidence. The media will love that, too.

*eta:* If you'd like help drafting emails for this purpose, feel free to hit my inbox.
Huh.  You realize you called me bigoted against rural Americans and in the same breath called them all stupid and brainwashed? 

But I’m curious: what’s my bigotry, and why am I scared of them?
You're actively saying them not understanding your group is bigotry, but you clearly don't understand theirs.  And by the looks of it have no more interest in ""being a decent person"" as you put it 

There's a huge difference between ignorance and stupidity which might be your fundamental problem. I'm calling them ignorant and lied to. The inability to differentiate is a huge problem America as a whole is having. A lot of the Midwest and South has a grade school education.  No their not stupid as you assume, they didn't get the chance for better
Except that’s not at all what I said. I mean, please, point me to the quote where I say not understanding is what makes something bigotry.

I did not and will not call them stupid. That was you. 

Ignorance-based or unconscious bigotry is…still bigotry, by the way. But an ignorant person is making a *choice* when instead of treating someone like a human being, they decide to hide in a corner *at work* swapping mean gossip about that person. 

Oh, and so we’re clear,  a sincere religious belief can also very much be bigoted.
Your own statement send to indicate that ignorance requires curiosity at a base.  It seems like contentment isn't a possible option to meet your base. 

To be clear in not trying to justify their behavior.  But you don't seem to, or are arguing as though you don't, understand the power of being ignorant but not thinking you're ignorant.  

Not sure how I have off an impression otherwise,  definitely not my intention but all religion is bigoted. There can't be an in group without an out group

And since you're cramming words deep into my throat she demanding quotes for things I never claimed you directly said,  where did I say ignorant people are stupid. 

You make that exact and direct claim twice.  Let's see it,  put up or shut up
Contentment is perfectly fine but irrelevant to the situation of being directly exposed a thing you aren’t familiar with. If the thing is a coworker you have to interact with daily, ‘contentment with ignorance’ becomes an active choice to be a dick when you consistently express that ‘ignorance’ in a way that is counter to basic human decency. If you don’t want to know more, then sure, fine, but then you keep your thoughts to yourself and treat your coworker with basic respect. 

And ok:

“You have to see the irony. They're just as afraid of you as you are of them, mockery is just the coping mechanism for both sides. They're just fucking stupid and have no good argument to make.”
What I keep trying to get you to understand is his coworkers do not think they are ignorant about trans issues.  They in fact think they know everything there is to know.  Which can be much much worse.


Right in my ugly f-ing face. I see where I created a misunderstanding on the last point specifically,  I was trying to refer to his coworkers as stupid. Sorry I have serious issues with being clear. I have a bad habit of using the proverbial THEY to much.

That was incredibly ambiguous at best and to get my point across at all."	z4mv94	trans	449	0.99	2022-11-25 20:09:23
"Did you ocasionally frequently ""misgender"" yourself when you came out as trans/begin your transition?"	"That's really just a silly question of mine, no story involved.

I've been open about being trans for around 2 months to some close friends, but sometimes when I'm too mad or burnt with something I still catch myself using the wrong pronouns.

Do you think this happens because I still have to go by male pronouns to most people?  


Edit: Ocasionally OR frequently\*"	"Yes, all the time. I misgender myself far too often
It's been kinda shameful because I keep deadnaming and misgendering myself but all my friends got my name and pronouns down pat right away. the worst I had was I changed my discord name and a few people didn't recognize me
Yes. I still do from time to time. And deadname myself inside my own head. 

It happens. It's like any other habit and isn't instantly broken and replaced.
I still do, usually when talking to medical or government officials. It's an instinctive form of self preservation, but every time I do it I die inside.
I don't anymore but it took awhile. Every time you misgender yourself; pause, correct, and move on with your thought. You'll get better at it. It definitely helps to have people use your name/pronouns but I had it down for myself before I socially transitioned.
I've only identified as trans for a few months and have been actively transitioning for 6 weeks And I still do it like once a week 🙄
I’ve rarely referred to myself by pronouns. So that’s never been much of an issue. But after 2 years I’m still misgendering myself in my head all the damn time and referring to myself by my old name.
Sometimes I do mentally but I usually correct myself pretty quickly.
i did at the beginning of transition because i kept forgetting who i had come out to and was playing it safe, happens less now
Sometimes. It's generally pretty rare.

Most recently was when I was fighting with my wife I misgendered the shit out of myself. I kinda associate my anger with boy me so it's probably unhealthy but I dealt with it that way. Definitely really upsetting to my wife to hear that.
I did it for a while. I've been out for a year now and now I consistently gender myself correctly without effort. The *starting point* for me personally was no longer viewing myself as a boy trying to be a girl, but as a girl who had a birth defect who made her body grow as a boy's does. That's not required by any means but it sure helped me. 

I'm also not publicly out yet, so I often have to misgender myself in public contexts or deal with being misgendered. I've managed to make my personal view of myself stick enough that even *that* doesn't effect me. 

Having trouble with that is common and it's no reflection on you. You've been trained to see and refer to yourself one way for your whole life and you have to recalibrate your perspective. Good topic OP ^.^
I've been he/him for 29 years. She/they fulltime for 4 months. Ima fuck it up all the time for at least a year or two.
Yup I definitely did, habits are hard for anyone to break! Hell I probably still do it from time to time.
i'm not even sure how this would work
I only accepted I was trans recently (less than a month) and I still catch myself.  It's mostly thinking in terms of me as a part of ""the guys"" and not ""the girls"".  So almost all mental.  I have had sometimes where the few people I am out to use my pronouns and I'm like ""who?  Oh, me.""
I mean, I notice it every time. But, yes.

What's even worse, is I'll misgender myself infront of people I'm out to on accident.

And then do the opposite on accident to people I'm not out to.

So, yes. I am a mess. Life is strange.
I've been out to myself for 3 months and it still doesn't feel real. I have to force myself to use the proper words and pronouns because doing so feels like a mockery of what it should.
Yeah, all the time at the beginning. I'm now 11 months in, and I can't remember the last time since I misgendered myself. Although I still find trouble asserting myself publicly as she/her, mostly due to fear of transphobic responses.
lol, beginning? I’m 3 years on hrt and still do it.
Not that much. Portuguese allows you to be gender neutral 100% of the time. So I just did that.
All the time! Don’t beat yourself up about it. Your brain was conditioned for YEARS UPON YEARS to refer to itself a certain way. It takes time to untangle those wires.
yea, i do that all the time. idk why but for some reason, as much as my deadname and my agab makes me physically cringe to think about, i continue to use them for myself, especially when i’m mentally worn down. im assuming it’s some form of emotional self harm for some? (but judging on the comments of others, it’s also just a force of habit)
I kinda have to a lot as in the early stages not everybody will even believe you. just gotta grow out my VERY slowly growing hair and shave and I’ll be good.
i did it for the first 6 months before everything kind of clicked. ""one of the boys"", ""guy"", crap like that. takes a while for your brain to accept it without having to think about it
Yes, I hate it
I haven’t started dreaming with my name and pronouns yet if that counts.
I find that the past really gets me. 

I seem to have hard-coded myself as dude in my memories, so I’ve absolutely misgendered myself. Feels weird.
Yes. I still do in my head occasionally because I spend 40 years with she/her. So even though he/him feels correct, I still autopilot/autocorrect wrongly occasionally.  

Likewise, I’m dyslexic and sometimes fear that I will misspell my name because of its newness. Luckily I haven’t, but it crosses my mind and I double check.
  Definitely when I first came out. Lately not as much, but I've had a good few years to adjust (being out socially and hearing other people actually use the correct name/pronouns helps). I think there's a bit of disconnect at first because you have other voices around you still using your old name and such, and haven't grown to recognize the correct name yet! Like when a puppy is learning to recognize their name.
It's been almost a year since my egg cracked, 9 months since I started hormones, and 6 months since I started full-timing, and I still misgender myself sometimes lmao. But I'm getting better about it for sure. I imagine by this time next year it'll be pretty rare.
Been on HRT for 5 months, *still* do it sometimes. I'll be reading something about a guy being oblivious or not trying or doing the bare minimum and I'll reflexively think ""I'm glad I'm a better guy than that"" before my brain catches up
It happen sometimes
It used to happen a lot at first but not much now. It's different for me though cause I speak Icelandic, which is a very gendered language. For example all adjectives are either male or female, and so when I'd be saying anything about myself I would be used to saying the *wrong* gender.
Yea, i experience this quite a lot and all i can say is the more people gender you correctly and you in your head gender yourself correctly your subconscious will accept it quicker if that makes sense

Just keep trying and eventually you'll be fine in my experience anyway:))
i’m 6 months on hormones, been out for longer and still find myself using my deadname and he/him pronouns

all part of the cycle, apparently /j
I used to accidentally misgender myself in daydreams cuz ppl were still using the wrong pronouns for me. I started correcting myself cuz it would make me feel like crap thinking about those who don’t respect my pronouns. Only time I do purposely misgender myself is when it’s playfully misgendering myself (like looking in the mirror and saying ‘ooh she lookin cute today’ n crap like that). I don’t allow that from other people tho because part of me will always wonder what their intentions actually were n if they actually don’t see me for me. It’s better to just avoid it by having them respect my pronouns.
Literally constantly. My wife genders me with a higher accuracy than I do.
Oh yes! My brain fog ensures that I will generally mess up all the pronouns, mostly my own. I just got good at correcting myself quickly and people rarely really notice.
I sometimes misgender myself when meeting people who my older sibling went to high school with or a teacher that they had
Still doing it a year and a half later...but oh well.
I am going to therapy with a psychologist. I am using he/him pronouns.. but is because I don't feel comfortable using she /her pronouns just yet with her.
The only one that calls me with she/her pronouns is my wife.
Yes mostly in my head, bc I’m so used to it.
I misgender myself in my head all the time. It’s hard cuz I have a constant internal dialog that likes to be 3rd person and so it’s common that I use she or my other name than he or Mark.
Yes
I honestly never thought about myself by deadname and honestly I am surprised it took 22 years for me to crack.
Actually, no I don't
Even though people who don't know I'm trans are talking to me, I don't misgender and deadnamimg myself (when it comes to talking, obv, I have no other option)
Yeah, sadly. It pretty much only happens when I say like gendered words like ''prince'' ''king'' and that type of stuff yk. it happens to all of us homie, dw.
I’ve been out with friends for about 2 years now and i rarely do anymore but for the first year after i came out i’d misgender myself pretty often, it takes some time to get used to correctly gendering yourself.
It improved for me once I started hearing the new pronouns across the board and not just from a few close folks! But yes- it DEF happened. It’s and adjustment and it passed for me in time!!!!!
I found it REALLY helpful to correct myself outloud when I did... so yeah I might have🥺... did
Yes, and I still do, but I'm tryna fight with it and every day I'm more and more referring to myself as a man. Misgendering one's self is normal if you realized you're trans not a very long time ago, since all of your life you've been referred to as your agab, and you're so used to it
You know how in the first few months of the year, everyone often writes down the wrong year out of habit? It's something like that, just at a larger scale.
for me, its just the imposter syndrome, or i feel like i don’t deserve to be called a lady, its a hard mentality to break but, always trying to break free from the forced masc since birth, dont beat yourself up about it, it takes time even for you to adjust, you’re vaild! im proud of you
All the time, even 8-ish (I think?) years into HRT.  Just remember most of us have still spent more of our lives using the old/wrong pronouns.  

Possibly off topic, but one that helped me care less when  my inner dialogue bothered me-

I saw a discussion a linguist had defending internet speak, and they said that language is wild.  All words are just made up sounds in a specific order to help transmit an idea or mental image to someone else.  It doesn't matter what that sound it is as long as that mental image is transmitted.  That's why if you forget a word and say complete gibberish the other person will likely still understand you.  You're used to one sound representing that mental image, now you're replacing that with a new one, like learning a new language.  Even bilingual people constantly use a word from language A when they're speaking language B because their brain just happened to supply that one first.
God yes. I’ve been out for 2/3 months and i keep mentally doing it. The worst part is my inner voice is still my old voice so it definitely leads to imposter syndrome and dysphoric feelings. 

I just try and tell myself that these things take time and i’ll get there :)
It's very normal. I still occasionally dream I'm a guy and I'm coming up to three years.

Eventually it'll pass as time goes on
As bad as it sounds in general, I aim to relate (partially) to the discord part. I've been thinking that when I end up coming out to public it'll be easier to just abandon all of my social networks and start them anew. As to why is sort of a long story, but I guess it's not hard to assume the reason.
I know it's rare to refer to yourself with pronouns because we hardly use sentences in third person or refer to ourselves this way (unless we're correcting someone I guess?). Also because most english words are gender neutral I suppose, but in my language a TON of adjectives and such are gendered, so it happens way often than I expected while I'm speaking to others or rambling to myself

Also, I'm saying this guessing english is your main language. Sorry if it's not
Fuck
Thanks :\^)
Is this a r/suddenlycaralho?
In my case it was more funny because they started talking to me like ""oh hey it's okay you're new here, right?"" 
I hope you can find a safe way to come out when you're ready to
It is. Yeah gendered languages are a totally foreign concept to me. I’m sure I would do it much more if I spoke a language like that.
Why fuck?
I mean, while it sucks it's also good training. Because even though I let it out by accident sometimes, I'm quick to correct myself. So maybe this one particularity helps me get used to it.
Sad that you would treat yourself like that, and sad that your partner has to see that. Reminds me of my unhealthy ex
Yeah I can see that. I suppose when a language doesn’t do that you run into what we have right now in the states. Which is people stumbling and struggling over the idea of using they/them instead of gendered pronouns.
Def unhealthy. I'm still working through some of my issues."	rgc603	trans	433	0.99	2021-12-14 17:13:07
(FTM) cis male dudebro allies are the greatest allies to me	"I was talking to some people I didn't know, and I was with one of my cis friends. One of the people misgendered me, and my friend then gestured to me and said ""Excuse me, this is a man. Weiner and all."" 

And this one time I got in trouble for using the men's bathroom at school, a different cis friend said ""You were just too powerful.""

Cis male himbos are something else, I swear."	"""Excuse me, this bro is so manly that he takes EXTRA testosterone.""
>""Excuse me, this is a man. Weiner and all.""

...am I the only one who read that in Butt-Head's voice? 🤔🤷😜😁
Chads acknowledge and protect a fellow Chad when they see one, it's in the Chad constitution.
Let's just be real. Gender has nothing to do with being a supporter or not. It's all about the mentality ❤
That's so kind and sweet! :)
I feel the same way with cis women that support me tbh, it’s a fantastic feeling
I have like 3 guy friends at school (theyre not my besties but theyre still really nice and funny) and when they found out i was transmasc they immediately switched to using my pronouns and they even told me ""i always sorta suspected you were a guy, but i didnt know if i should say anything in case you werent"" and that was really validating
A lotta dude bros you'd think would be homophobes actually totally support it
same here bro i don't know why it is but cishet dudes have been the most accepting with me - save for one who had a crush on me and didn't want to be gay lol
Cis male dudebros have been my biggest allies too! They're sometimes curious but usually think it's just dope
👏
That's funny
ahh yay i'm super happy for you! cishet friends my age who are guys have been the complete opposite to me and i've had a horrible experience with them haha but i'm glad you haven't had that happen :)
The soux chef at a kitchen i worked at is such a dudebro and a great friend, and when his ex wife talked shit about me being trans he was like ""uh no stop right there. This dudes got one knocking his knees so shut the fuck up"". He did so much to include me as one of the bros during hangouts and stuff, correcting our transphobic head chef on my pronouns multiple times, and doing everything in his power to make sure that I knew he saw me as a man, even without testosterone in my veins, and I don't think he'll even know how much that meant to me. Dudebros can be the fuckin best
“You were just too powerful” is something my male friends would absolutely say

I think what op is referring to tho is how men talk to each other in a different way than they would to women. Thus, these examples becomes both supportive and affirming.
they can be transphobes still...
Chadstitution!
Also, guys tend to be more aggressive in general. If they support someone they will do so aggressively.
Not saying they can't just most ""frat"" guys i've met have been totally cool with the idea n stuff. But my experience isn't everyone's

Do I Have the Right to be Upset?	"So I came out to my mom and both of my sisters as trans and one sister accepted it, my mom doesn't and my other sister never responded, though I was hoping she'd accept me because she is a lesbian, I figured she'd kind of understand in a weird way?

So, my mom refuses to use he/him pronouns for me, but the one sister that accepted it tells me to cut her some slack, to not try to correct her to just let her do it, and that's... Fine, I guess...

But my lesbian sister is FaceTiming my mom right now and we greeted each other and sister said ""hey sister!"" And I corrected her, she apologized and corrected herself, but then went on to misgender me and deadname me in conversation to my mom knowing I was sitting right there.

On one hand I get it, my mom is very Christian and very... Fragile... But on the other hand, they're supporting her transphobia and like I'm their brother, don't I deserve any respect? 

Am I overthinking this?"	"No. Your family is being shitty.
In my experience it takes a bit of time for people to get in the habit of using your real name and pronouns, but if they aren't even trying...that is just shitty of them and you totally have the right to be upset. 

I had to correct my family, still do, but some have figured it out while others don't even try. It's frustrating. I'm thinking of wearing a name tag while at my fam's house and just pointing to it when they use my old name. 

I just can't tell if my family members who aren't using my new name are doing it out of spite or habit. One is my 12 yr old sister...so I have a hard time thinking she (a bisexual who didn't ever have to experience being closeted thanks to the hard work her older siblings have put into getting the family to be chill with LGBTQ+ stuff) is meaning to hurt me. My brother, 17, is so awkward around me now and hardly makes eye contact with me, and he gets around the issue by not using any name or pronouns for me. My dad seemed fine and accepting when I came out, but he has yet to use my name or correct pronouns. So...it just takes time. I've only been out to them for a month and a half, but since I don't live with them so it's only been a few days of actual interaction.

Keep up the work of correcting them, and get angry with them as needed. I think it helps to drive the point home when they know how much pain you're in :) I wish you good fortune.
no yeah continue to correct. my sister is also gay but did really well w pronouns even in the beginning
You’re family is being shitty. CALL THEM OUT!! You have 100% right to be upset.
No, your not overthinking at all. They are actively enabling her behavior. If they were really supporting you, they would be using your correct pronons and names in from of her to get the point across to her. There is no ""giving slack"" with this. If you dont correct them there is the possibility that they will just think lf it as a phase and something you are not serious about. You need to send the point home that this is you and you have to respect it and try at least.
(Also, was that a normal thing for her to say ""hey sister?"" Idk, if thats not normal for you both, than its kinda weird that she said it)
You absolutely have a right to be upset about that. You 100% deserve respect and authenticity, just like any cis person, and it *isn't* okay for them to treat you like that. With that said, though, it's also something you might have to deal with for a while. You don't have to accept it, but it'll probably happen for a little while longer.
You definitely have an awful mom. You do have the right to be upset.
>my mom is very Christian

That isn't a fucking excuse

True Christianity is loving and accepting EVERYONE. NO MATTER WHAT.

If they're hateful to anyone, for any reason, they aren't Christian, they're cultists
The one that apologized could.be legit making a mistake. It's a huge adjustment for someone you've known for a looooooong time to change their name and pronouns. So give her time. Your mother is another case, but proceed as you think best as you know your relationship better than a bunch of strangers on the internet.
If you just came out, this is understandable but if its been like, a year now this is unacceptable, terrible, rude, and disrespectful, my best friend came out to me as trans around a year ago now, ive gottwn all their pronouns down and their new name (even forgot the dead one honestly) they changed their new name recently and its beena breeze the old name was ten and now its nether, my point is if its recent like 2 months then its a little acceptable but after like 6, start really correcting them, buy more male clothing, and a HE/HIM badge/pin, they are really cute and nice to have lol
You're asking about the rights to emotions? You can feel whatever you damn well want to feel. You're completely justified in being upset, your family seem to not care about their brother/son.
Yes, you do have the right to be upset.
Yes!
Ya know, you've had a while to process this.  They have had a day.  It's not being shitty.  You probably didn't realize you were trans a day ago.  And BTW it's probably not easy to imagine what you're going through for them.  I hope it goes better but remember you got a big head start at processing that you're trans.  Have some patience.
It does take time for people to get things like pronouns right but the more you correct them the more they're likely to remember and you can feel bad about them using the wrong pronouns cos even when it is a genuine accident it can still hurt and that's understandable as it can cause things like dysphoria
You have the right to be upset. But is it worth letting them live rent-free in your head?
Misgender your mother. He is now your father.
Nah, you have every right to be upset. Your Mom shouldn’t let her religion get between her and her son. I come from a very Christain family, so I get it a bit. At this point though, people are just willfully being ignorant if they still don’t like trans people for some reason.
Not to be a dick but being a lesbian ain't no pass for being transphobic.. actually a portion (bigger than i expected) of TERFs are lesbians.. so
My sister changed her name, nothing to do with trans, and I still occasionally fuck it up 5+ years later. Everyone tries to say the right name and it seems easiest for the younger ones and sometimes annoyingly difficult for the grandmas. But in all cases it has nothing to do with being a jerk. Its just muscle memmory and comes out without thinking. Now ofcourse people try and most of the time noone in the family uses the old name anymore, but sometimes when you're in a hurry or something then you accidentally jump the old one.

An important thing to realize here is that if others have been doing something for 20+ years and you tell them to change that, then it may take varying time to do so. If they put in zero effort then they are jerks, but if they try and get it, lets say, 50% correct then you really cant get mad. Things just take time and even if you think about them a lot then to others they are just that random thing that someone asked.

Ps. They may fully support you but still use wrong name often for a long time. Thats just a memory glitch and has little to do with actual support or being a jerk.
We don't really have a normal way of greeting one another because we don't talk often enough, but when we do talk, 'hey sister' has been the greeting from both sisters.
Oh, my God, thank you. This. Yes. If I could upvote more than once I would. 

Religious hypocrisy and hate-cult thinking *pisses me off so much.*
Yeah my mom has gone to the point of buying me feminine clothing without talking to me about it first when I showed her how I look in my very first binder. It's almost like she's actively barking against me on this. Even my husband's LGBTQIA+ family said 'give her time, a mother needs to grieve the loss of her child before she can accept you as you are now' which I get 100% but this just seems to be too much. She's correcting people who gender me correctly and it hurts, especially when in the beginning she promised she would try. I regret moving in with her, I came here to try to better my mental health for my marriage but this is certainly not helping.
I'm pretty sure this is generally frowned upon, however justified it may be to hit them with the uno reverse card. 

Now, an air horn on the other hand... That's much better, lol.
I've thought of taking the 'treat them as though they have dementia' approach...

""Mom.... Mom, [REDACTED] is gone.... She has been for a while.... Are you feeling okay?""
Ah okay, That makes it seem a bit more or a normal thing. At least you were able to correct her the first thime she did it. I would definitely try and have more conversations with all of them just to kind of maybe explain more into how it makes you feel when they misgender you or deadname you. Of course, its a big change and its diffrent for them, but thats no reason for them to purposely keep doing it and not even trying to change their habits.
Oh no :(((
Oh well, this means youve been out for years, shes a total bitch lmao well its best to cut her off for fuckin sure"	tbds71	trans	410	0.99	2022-03-11 00:48:28
Got misgendered as a girl today, felt way better than being labeled a guy (19 they/them)		"Great pic. Makeup on point. Good for you
36 year old cis ally(his/him) here. 

So when I try to do anything with my hair I end up just looking like Don Draper, which isn’t bad since I wear a suit for work. No matter what gel or how much I use I get the same style. 

The only other alternatives have me looking like Marv from Home Alone, or like I stuck my hair in a blender. 

You on give other hand, have a sweet style all around and a slick cut too.
For those wondering, it's the Morphe Rainbow Palette
Please please can I ask, do both genders feel like misgendering to you? How would you explain that feeling? I think maybe I feel the same way, but it leaves me feeling so confused.

Edit: I just found a resource on another post, so you don't need to explain in depth how you feel if you don't want to do the emotional work involves in explaining that. 

I'm going to keep reading, but I think ""Woman-flux is the woman specific gender flux which refers to a gender experience of a fluxuating spectrum between “woman” and “agender.” Essentially, the feeling of gender turns up and down. When it’s up, it’s “woman” and when it’s down, it’s “agender.” describes me a little 🤔
I’m so proud of you 😁😁
I love your look
Hopefully they weren't catcalling/ making fun of you
Your makeup skills ... look pristine ☺☺
Glorious color choices! Love the shape of your glasses too
Thank you!
Thanks! I put mousse in my hair after a shower, then go to bed. I brush it out in the morning and it stays!
Texturing creams and mousses can help to break up the regularity of the way you do your hair. Also, try using your hands instead of a brush or comb to style your hair!!
Also you look amazing
Why thank you! As for specific gender terms, you don't have to worry about that unless it really gives you comfort. I'm just nonbinary, although specifically I feel more connected to my masculine side. I feel really free that way.

As for the misgendering, I definitely feel hurt when referred to with he/him or as a boy at all, mostly because I grew up that way and I realized when I was nonbinary that I always hated it, and hated my birthname too. When I get referred to with she/her, it just doesn't feel right either. It's not an intense dysphoria like with male pronouns, but it's not the euphoria I feel when assumed androgynously. When someone uses she/her for me it shows me that they know I'm trans, they're just misunderstanding where I fall.

Then again, quarantine has opened up another wave of questioning and dysphoria. For months I had no reason to present feminine at all, no way to really affirm myself at home and pretty much alone. So my feminine side felt really repressed and now I've been wondering if I am a trans girl. I don't think so, but it's possible.

It's never set in stone though, and that's especially why I love being enby. I can mix it up, present either way, or try new things too! Being confused sucks, but I know you'll make some progress eventually, as will I. Just learning to love myself has been a journey, especially through dysphoria.

Have a good day!
Thank you!
I love you both
No it was actually one of my professors!

Very welcome. You look incredible
Thank you so much 💚 I love this, and you've explained it so well. Expressing yourself the way you like is true freedom. I hope you have a good day too :)

Is the term ‘femboy’ offensive to transgender women?	"So I’m also in genderfluid spaces, and ppl will use this term to describe one of their genders

My brother and I talk about gender a lot, we’re both trans, and he told me that it wasn’t ok to use it, and that “feminine boy” would be more appropriate for genderfluid ppl to use

He then explained how it was used to invalidate women’s gender identity, and even fetishize them

He’s been out as trans and has been active in the trans community longer than I have, so I trust him on gender issues like this, but I did want to ask women myself.

Should I start correcting other ppl who are genderfluid when I see it?

EDIT: Thank you all so much for answering and helping me understand!

Just for clarification, I did already know that femboys were not trans women, I would not ever call a woman a femboy, as that is misgendering, and thereby offensive and disrespectful

That was not the reason I made the post, I made the post because I wasn’t sure if the term *itself* was offensive 

Thank you all so much! :) <3"	"I think it’s only really offensive if you are calling a trans woman a femboy. Femboy still ID as men, but enjoy cross dress, which is very very different then being a trans women
if you use it to describe a trans woman, yes, it's offensive

>and that “feminine boy” would be more appropriate for genderfluid ppl to use

that's literally what ""femboy"" is short for. and how exactly does that make it inclusive?
TBH, only if you're using it to refer to a transgender woman. Because you'd be misgendering her by calling her a ""boy"".

And, as someone else said, un-shortening it by using ""feminine boy"" makes zero difference. It's the same thing.
So, typically most of the femboy community identifies as male. They embrace a fashion that has more feminine styles and for a lot of them it is a fetish. Not the same thing as a trans woman, who actually identifies as female. Hope that helps, I definitely can see where the confusion would occur
I’ve seen this question asked before.
Its about the context. If someone identifies as a feminine man its no problem. But for example calling a trans woman a fem boy is wrong ofc. 
I think there a plenty of terms that when used incorrectly can be offensive but aren’t offensive themselves necessarily.
It’s used by boys, both cis and trans, who identify as feminine. I’ve really *only* heard it to refer to or identify this identity in a generally positive light.
only call people femboy if they wanna be called that and you should be cool
Imo a lot of the issues regarding the word come up in anime. Characters that are coded as trans women constantly get labeled as femboys even by people in the community. As long as people listen to actual trans voices on these topics and don't label trans women as femboys other than when they specifically say they identify as such there isn't a problem with the term! Actual femboys are rad!
Femboys are people who identify as boys, yes there are a lot of fettishists but femboy culture atleast to me seems to do a bit of good for trans women. I know a lot of trans girls I know used being femboys as a way to come into their feminine side.


TL:DR I think it's compleatly fine for femboys to be femboys and use the term
If someone called me a femboy I would be offended because I'm a woman, but the existence of femboys is not offensive.
i think it’s offensive if you call a trans woman that (because trans women are women)


but i think it’s just a shortened version of feminine boy

i consider myself a femboy (or i at least want to be a femboy) but it’s not sexual for me (i’m asexual)

in the end, yes words can hurt, but a word can be reclaimed (to those who it pertains to)
If im (a trans woman) being called a femboy, yes it's offensive. If someone else that identifies as a femboy, is being called a femboy, no it's not offensive to me.

Its effectively its own thing. Just like calling a transmasc, transmasc isn't going to be offensive to a trans woman. Same logic.
TW: T slur

I'm a trans girl. If you called me a femboy id probably cry. I have a friend who's questioning that goes by she her pronouns now but still sometimes calls herself a femboy.

If you called *her* a femboy I don't know how she'd react, but  I imagine not particularly well.

I don't have an issue with you calling actual crossdressing boys femboys. That's the word they use to describe their fetish. The thing is that context matters. 

Some slang though you're probably better off avoiding. 

If you wouldn't call a gay person a F*g, a black person the N-word, or a Hispanic person the S-word, you probably shouldn't call a trans girl a Trap.

Edit: forgot a warning.
Anything can be offensive so it's best to only say it to people who you've asked permission from
To call a trans woman a ""femboy"", yes that's very transphobic. To use the term for people who identify as femboys, that's safe to do
no . they're boys, im a girl, so why would it be offensive??
Femboy does not equal transgender, some femboys may be trans, but there’s no correlation between the two
Your brother is right that it is used to invalidate and fetishize trans women but if someone uses that term for people that identify as femboys it's fine.
Yes. If a person does not identify as such then it can be offensive to regard them as such.
We are not boys, so that would just be missgendering us. The term is feminin boy, we are women
I'm not a boy so yes very much so
“Femboy” by itself isn’t offensive. Some boys do identify as femboys. It would be offensive if anyone used it for me (a trans woman) since I am not a boy. I expect this reaction to be generally true for trans women. To imply we are feminine boys can be deeply hurtful and dismissive.

If someone identifies with a label it is generally OK. If they don’t identify with it, don’t use that label for them.

I am not familiar enough with the gender fluid community to know any general rules on how they prefer to be referred to and at what times. It might be a very individual thing.
Femboys are just feminine men. They are entirely separate from trans women. So no, it is not offensive, as long as you are not calling trans women femboys.
femboy literally just means “boy who is feminine”. If someone calls a trans woman that then yes, it’s offensive since it’d be misgendering, but other than that it should be fine to use
If someone calls me a femboy it’s offensive since I am mtf trans who wishes to be 100% cis passing. For me personally it is offensive, but I don’t think of it as a slur… unless anyone decides to use it as a slur which in that case I’d fuck them up LOL
Only if used to describe me. My trans bf identifiesas a femboy tho and there's nothing wrong with that!
No
It doesn’t matter what we say here. Whoever you meet in public or online will have a different viewpoint. 

It’s best to take things on a case by case scenario. No two scenarios will be the same. You may meet femboys who don’t wanna be called trans you may meet trans women who don’t wanna be called femboys. You may meet someone who is ok with either one. You don’t know who you’re gonna meet. Just call whoever by whatever they introduce themselves as and there won’t be a problem
Your brother is correct to me.  Calling a trans woman a femboy could be offensive.  Trans woman is a woman.  :)

The term femboy itself isn’t offensive tho
No. Being a femboy is completely different
Nope femboys are fking awesome and my best friend was one for a while before he came out as nb but ide just go on a case by case basis and ask as that will give you way more insight cause I’ve known people that actually like being called slurs or otherwise offensive things either for the sake of reclamation or whatever else their motives were.
Personally, I abhore that word. Specifically when directed at me, I have no qualms with others using it.
From what I can tell, it's not offensive.
My partner actually used to describe himself as that before realizing he wasn't just a feminine boy- but rather genderfluid.
The word isn’t offensive in and of itself. It is offensive to call a trans woman a femboy, and vice versa. They are not the same and conflating the two is disrespectful.
And today on r/trans: is the word boy offensive to women?
As a trans guy ive known about some trans guys who identify as femboys. It really depends entirely on context and your brother seems too laser focused on one identity’s thoughts
As MtF trans, it's only offensive given context, similar to how misgendering is only offensive if it's done on purpose. MtF women are physically similar to femboys so it's not a wild assumption. If someone came up to me and assumed I was a femboy, I'd correct them and be on my way. No need to get hung over it.
I actually made a whole YouTube video investigating this literally like 4 days ago if you wanna watch it. I'm a trans woman so hopefully it gives you a little insight into the thought process I went through with this exact question. https://youtu.be/E8-FOCU7dbE
Not to me
I see looking like a femboy as a goal.
If you use it to trans woman its basicly like saying that we are only men in dresses. About gender fluid people sorry i cant say anything appropiate im not one, sorry again😅
Depends


Are they a man? Its cool generally

Are the a girl? It is offensive.

Trans girls shouldnt be called femboys, save for if they want to be (not that ive seen a transgirl want to be called a femboy but im not one to control how someon3 refers to herself)
For boys who present Feminine,  unless they themselves d9nt like the term, id say its ok
One thing I've noticed about the LGBTQ+ community is that one person will be personally uncomfortable with a term and then declare it off limits to an entire community because they don't like it and then people just blindly accept it because they have good intentions and don't want to harm anyone. However that behavior in itself is harmful.
If someone wants to call themself anything that is their right. Unless a word's *only* functional context is an offensive one, nothing is off limits technically. That doesn't mean call anyone whatever you want and say whatever you please regardless who it harms, but it does mean that just because you say something is bad, doesn't make it bad unless it can be universally agreed on (For example, racial slurs)
People come from a good place, but never take them at face value. Use common sense and thorough research before you come to the conclusion (and this goes for any type of information)
Yes, it is, to trans women. Trans men or any man can be a femboy, as a femboy purely just means a feminine boy. It would be misgendering and offensive to call a trans woman a femboy since they are women and not men, therefore not feminine boys and just women.
femboys are feminine boys. unless they have specified otherwise, yes it’s offensive.

now, i’m a demiboy that’s generally uncomfortable with most male labels but i like this one, but that’s different
I would not be happy if someone called me ""femboy"". But cannot speak for others.
I’ve heard the argument that it’s a slur that has been directed at trans women, sort of like sissy or ladyboy and therefore it shouldn’t be used by cis people because there essentially trying to claim a transphobic slur as their identity.. which like yeah I sorta get . I don’t feel super strongly about it but like why do people feel the need to create this new identity around a slur idk
If I, a trans woman, got called a femboy by someone I was out to, I'd be very upset and offended, yes.
no not really don't call a transwomen a femboy tho
Only people you should call femboys are people who call themselves femboys.
It was to me
Not any more than the term tomboy is offensive to trans men.
No, they’re boys who are feminine, I’m a woman. I don’t see how it could be offensive
As a trans woman I personally don't have any issue with it. But I would be very careful with how you use it cause there are people who would be offended by it. I'd say unless you know for sure they're ok with it maybe don't. Because there is still the implication that you are referring to them as male.
I have no I’ll will towards fem boys and I don’t think it’s at all offensive when fem boys call themself that or people call them that. 

It does suck that some ignorant people don’t understand the difference between fem boy and trans women but that was already an issue we faced when the general public learned what drag was so I don’t really blame anyone I don’t think theirs harm in using the word if you’re using it correctly and hopefully are quick to correct any confusion
Femboys are just something completely different from trans women, one is a *feminine boy* as the name would suggest and one is a complete woman
No it's not, ""femboy"" is quite literally a shortened version of ""feminine boy"", it means exactly the same.

It means boys who enjoy feminine aesthetic, there's nothing wrong with it

However, transphobes often use it to harrass trans women by saying they are ""femboys"" aka just dudes in skirt, also the term femboy is has also been stupidly sexualized over the years.

So no, there's nothing wrong with the term itself, but it has history of being taken out of context so it triggers some people. In femboy spaces use it as you may, its also a-ok in transmasc spaces. Be a little carefull in transfem spaces tho, because 1- as I said, people could get triggered  2-why are you saying femboy in a transfem space? Check to see it can't be taken out of context

TL;DR: There's nothing wrong with the term , some humans are just transphobic
if used for transgender women yes

if used for femmanine boys no

also femboy isnt a non binary gender its a term used to describe men (or nbs) who express tgemselves femininely
femboys aren’t trans people though, they’re just dudes who like to express their femininity wearing dresses and stuff the whole maid outfit, as a trans person heavily in the gay+trans community i can say without doubt that femboy has nothing to do with trans people and that the only way it could be offensive is if you’re targeting a transwoman and calling them a femboy
Only if a trans woman is called a femboy. Otherwise a femboy is just a feminine person who identifies as male.
only if you use it for a trans woman!
Femboy is offensive to call a trans woman because not all trans women are fem and exactpy 0 trans women are boys. Thats kind of the point.
Not at all
Any one person can choose how they want to identify. Femboy can be an offensive term, but there's a lot of people who identify with it. Same thing with it/it's pronouns, I would never use them for somebody unless they made it clear that they identify with those pronouns.
As many other have said if describing a trans woaman then yes its offensive but otherwise na i wouldnt say it is seeing femboys still identify as males just in crossdress or acting more feminine.
Here's my hot take - people are over thinking it and just trying to be offended. Femboy isn't an identity or a gender or a sexuality. It's a meme, a style, an aesthetic. Anyone can be a femboy - cis men, cis women, trans men, trans women, non binary and everything in-between and beyond. For context I'm a trans woman but I still do femboy shit because it's funny to me, it's like cosplay. People don't get offended by Drag Kings and Drag Queens, so why femboy? That's like trying to boycot Tomboys. It's dumb and anyone offended by it should re priorities their direction of activism for the community.
I go by one rule call people what they're ok being called, if one likes it call them that and another doesn't dont.
I feel part of the issue is some people don't know what Femboy means. When my friend came out as Trans, she said she was a Femboy, so I thought she meant she liked to crossdress and that's about it. Its only 2 days after I realized she meant it as Transgender during another conversation.

Another part of the issue is the internet helped bastardized a lot of words. Words that clearly meant something specific can now mean several different things depending on who you ask in the world. Its like if the dictionary was a Rubik's cube that keeps shifting.

In the end I guess its just a question of intent. Getting someone's tone of the internet can sometimes be hard, so I think we should ask them what they think those words mean before vilifying them. If someone is actually saying something as a way to attack another person in regards to religion/gender identity/sexual orientation: Go for the metaphorical throat.
I personally take no offence to the word at all, but I can kind of see how other people would.
>Is the term ‘femboy’ offensive to transgender women?

No, because it's a fashion aesthetic, not a gender identity. I feel no animosity towards crossdressers.
I see femboy as a non-slur translation of tr*p. Both words semantically mean boy with a feminine gender expression, and both get used on trans women sometimes.

IMTO: both need to stop being used for trans women but only tr*p needs to die entirely.
I think it’s fine if someone calls themselves a femboy, but generally not ok to call someone else that. It could offend someone.
I’m a transgender man I don’t mind people calling a femboy but by definition trans women just can’t be femboys they’re not male so that’s disrespectful

[deleted]
Used to describe self jokingly? It's ok. Any time else? Not ok
Bruh. ""Feminine boy"" is literally just a longer version of femboy. There's nothing wrong with the original word.
femboy isn't a term I would use for anyone regardless of gender identity unless I specific knowledge that it wouldn't bother them.

for trans women specifically I would absolutely not use it. trans women are women, not boys.
Yes. It's the cousin word of >!shemale!<. Your brother is right. It is often used to invalidate women and their womanhood.

My first time using a spoiler. I can still see it. Is it hidden for others or not?
I think for genderfluid people it's no issue for me as a non binary person, I'd find fem boy not offensive but equally not ideal. Either
I would rather be seen as a femboy than just another man...
Wasn’t femboy an amab who comes off as femme?
Femboy literally originated as a porn category to fetishize trans women. Don't use it. A lot of trans women have talked about this on other platforms. It's a shitty term that is inherently transphobic because it's history is transphobic. Don't use it. Idc what you ID as, only trans women can reclaim it because it originates as a term used to refer to them and for obvious reasons, they won't use it for themselves.
Some people are saying that people that use it are feminine men, but i dont think it’s really cool to assume that you can throw the word around to any man that exhibits or performs feminine traits/femininity. I am a bisexual trans man and i wear nail polish and earrings and i put a lot of care into my appearance and i’m very short. I can be feminine. Call me a femboy and i’m punching you in the face. It’s not ALWAYS sexual yes, but the only time ive been called that has been by chasers (who know im trans) and people who assume i’m submissive because of my appearance. I figure its usually just a safe bet to keep that word to just fictional characters unless someone TELLS you they use it for themself.
Yeah, calling a trans woman a femboy is offensive because you are inciting that she is still a boy/man.

But the term “femboy” isn’t offensive because it is short for ‘feminine boy’ however you should always ask people if you can call them that because some people might not like being called that. 

So short story short, dont call trans women femboy and always ask what terms you can call people
Obviously
My therapist said I might be a femboy and I got super offended
Ik the difference
I don’t even know, I was very confused during that conversation
*technically* what OP is talking about with it being fetishizing is when it was short for female boy, but that meaning has definitely been mostly forgotten
Makes sense
Also worth noting that there are absolutely transmasculine femboys. Self-ID is not the same as calling someone else something that may not suit them.

It's offensive to call a trans woman a femboy as an attempt to dismiss and invalidate her gender identity.

It's not harmful to trans women let a man (cis or trans) call *himself* a femboy, or to refer to him as such in conversation when you know he self-refers that way. It's also not helpful to pressure AMAB people who aren't certain if they're a trans woman or if femboy is a better fit, to ID as a trans woman. Let people ID as a femboy and later come out as a woman if that's the way their hatching ends up going.

Edit: also not a problem if nonbinary people use ""femboy"" as part of their identity. Still self-ID, and therefore their own business.
it’s at wild i started out trying to be a femboy and just after a month was like, no wait i’m actually fully a woman! lmao
I've been calling my enby self femboy some. I think a lot of AMAB enbies use it as well?
The fetishist people is not a lot of them. A large amount of them are only in it for the fashion and dislike being fetishized. I just want to make that clear because I am yet to unsubscribe from my time on those subreddits and the amount of posts I see talking about how much people hate being fetishized makes me want to keep this 100% clear.
That makes sense, I would never misgender someone like that. That’s just disrespectful 

He didn’t explain it very well, it was a confusing conversation, basically in the end it was “just listen to me, Ik what I’m talking about”
Yeah, that’s how I’ve seen it used too. That conversation was really confusing, but I don’t know everything. I don’t know what I don’t know, and the last thing I want is to come off as transphobic over something I didn’t know.
Okie :)
They are indeed. Ty :)
Couldn't agree more with this!
Understandable
Makes sense
Actually calling trans women femboy was not the context in the conversation, I’m aware that is misgendering, that’s not something I would do

In context of the conversation, he was joking about how my gender expression was very “straight”(whatever that means) because I’m feminine on the days I’m a woman, and masculine on the days I’m a man

Then I said, “yeah, some genderfluid ppl identify as femboy being one of their genders, but I don’t”
(As in actual femboys, not trans women)

That’s when he told me that the term itself was offensive to trans women because of how it’s sometimes used. Regardless of context, it’s something that he feels I should avoid all together.
""That's the word they use to describe their fetish""

Wtf. Presenting yourself how you want is not a fucking fetish ffs.
I'm fucking tired of people saying that it is.
Idk, that’s why I’m asking about it
I’m aware :)
It can be very individual, yeah. Some genderqueer or gender fluid people consider femboy as part of their identity, others don't, and it shouldn't be forced on people who don't want it but if someone calls themself a femboy... well that's really their own business, can't see how it could harm anyone else.
Ty :)
Yeah, he did not clarify that, not once in the conversation did I call a trans woman a femboy. I just mentioned that some gender fluid ppl use it to describe one of their genders, which got me wondering if it was the word itself. Like it was a slur or something
This.
What was the point of this comment exactly?
I have femboy tendencies myself because sometimes I just like looking cute
Wasn’t sure if it was a slur or something when I posted this. So it would not make sense to ask cis women about it
I wouldn't say it is a slur to trans people, more of just being downright offensive to trans women. The word 'trap' just means a man who tricks other men into thinking he is a woman. The word 'femboy' means a feminine boy. They are not the same thing. And it's only bad to trans women (when they are being called it), since I am a trans femboy myself.
Yikes
Then why did you make this post?
I think your friend is coming from a good place but is just straight up wrong. The post above is correct, it's offensive if you use it to describe a trans woman, it's not offensive if you're describing someone who identifies as a femboy.
Thats more or less what happened to my friend. Right now he's questioning (goes by he/she)
Yeah, I didn’t exclude. “Typically” femboys are male- NB can too. I’ve even seen women who call themselves femboys just because they feel like it fits.
That’s new info to me, thanks for pointing it out. In the subs I’m on, there’s a constant struggle to keep the NSFW posts off there. Maybe it just feels like that’s a lot of the community to me, and I assumed too much. Glad you said something!
It’s great to ask questions!
As a trans woman I second this. I think it depends on the context. Unfortunately, trans women are looked at as femboys and it’s derogatory in that way. 

But yeah femboys (feminine boys) are cool
You can tell him that at least one trans woman thinks that's bullshit. Language is built on context, *especially* languages where the same word can mean different things. (Like the English language.) If we treat every word used maliciously as a huge slur that shouldn't be said, we give all the power to those who choose to be malicious.
>my gender expression was very “straight”(whatever that means) because I’m feminine on the days I’m a woman, and masculine on the days I’m a man

Oh also this is a really strange take. I can kinda see what he's trying to mean, but even then I'd say you have a binary expression, not a straight one. Nothing wrong with leaning into whichever gender you feel fits best at the time. (Honestly I thought that was kinda standard for gender fluidity? Idk. Also apologies for misunderstanding the post.)
You're right that presenting how you want isn't a fetish. I've only ever seen femboy used in a fetishistic context. (That doesn't mean I'm right.)

Thanks for the reality check.
again, a fem boy is a boy, im a girl. well to old to be called a girl anymore, but  fem boy as a term is not offensive to me. doesnt apply to me.. boy them girl me.  dont  get the issue with the term.
Not a slur, trap is more like a slur.  Femboy is more of a description of an aesthetic.
 :) ❤️❤️
That is essentially what you asked
To ask if the term itself was offensive
Also, he’s not a trans woman. 

I’m a trans man and I make an effort not to speak on trans women’s issues because I wouldn’t fucking know
Glad I could help.
THIS. 

If you tell someone they can't self-identify as a word just because it can also be used maliciously, you're basically saying that the people who use the word as a slur are more important/valid than the people who use it as an identity. And THAT is pretty damn offensive!
If it comes up again, I will
It is normal for gender fluidity, I see posts with different pictures like that all the time in genderfluid spaces. I’m queer, *how* can I be compared to a straight person? That’s a sexuality, not a gender :/

Regardless of my agab, ANY relationship is going to be a queer one because I’m a man AND a woman. It’s going to be gay either way.

My family doesn’t make sense most of the time
What was the point of it tho? It doesn’t seem very helpful at all
Redditors when someone asks a simple genuine question (They must downvote it for literally no reason)
[deleted]
That’s kind of what I was thinking, but I wasn’t sure
I rephrased your question to make it self-explanatory rather than typing out an unnecessarily long explanation
what is the flag in your pfp
Yeah. I did edit the post to clarify that. I don’t understand why two of my comments are getting downvotes
Transfem
Well, if you know the difference that femboys are still boys, but don’t get that calling a trans woman a boy is offensive, you’re *really* missing some stuff.

Just to cement the point, I’m a trans woman. I’m a woman. I’m not a feminine boy. I’m not a boy. I don’t care if someone else calls themselves a femboy, but never call a trans woman a femboy (unless under a really special circumstance, and they ask you to)
oo ty
Did you read my edit in my post? I would not *ever* call a trans woman a femboy.

I was asking if the term itself was offensive because I didn’t know if it was a slur or something. Hence why the term itself might have been offensive, I wasn’t sure

Where was the miscommunication exactly?
I don’t know, I’ll be honest, not in a good place right now, just, was irrational. Thank you for asking, being kind, and taking the time to figure things out. Sorry for being so, I don’t know, confrontational, and I hope things go well for you
I’m sorry you’re in a bad place. I hope things get better for you

Just please read posts in the future. 

Negativity like that can make it scary to ask these questions
Yeah, normally when I’m in this mood I just, reread what I’m typing, and just delete it because I know it’s not worth it, you know, the saying, if you have nothing good to say, don’t say anything. I don’t know why I didn’t follow that this time. I’ll try to remember this though, and, thank you. Keep being awesome friend"	r8sbqy	trans	413	0.92	2021-12-04 15:46:15
Got misgendered a bunch at work so decided to show them by getting done up all cute! (21 MtF pre-everything)		"Good on you!!
And OMG where did you get those socks? I need them in my life
I love the socks omg 😭
Omg you look so cute in that
Get it girl 😻
you look hella cute. I love your mask too. :)
Beautiful
Cute dress girl!
Wow so good for you.. You look so cute, love the dress and the socks, just so cute...
Ordered them through sockdreams! It’s part of their pride collection, though I’m not sure if they’d have this exact model still in stock.
Is that specifically the trans ones?
Yeah I forget the model name, but I’m pretty sure yeah"	odus5a	trans	391	0.98	2021-07-04 22:45:59
Just had a shitty encounter at pride	"TW: unwanted physical contact 

There was this guy at pride I just talked to who was trying to get me to sign a petition and while he was talking to me he started complimenting me and he touched my hair and poked my exposed belly button and I moved away at that point cuz it was fucking weird. Like he just did those two things but I felt like violated a little? I don’t really know what to think right now because this is the first time anything like this has ever happened to me. He also misgendered me at the beginning of our conversation before correcting himself. He also also kept calling me “baby”. He was like 50 and the whole thing sucked. I feel like I’m not overreacting in how gross I feel right?"	"That's really weird and super gross. I'm sorry you had to go through that.
def not an overreaction, guys a fuckin creep
Definitely not overreacting. Touching without consent is assault.
Fuck that guy, he’s being a creep
No, certainly not an over reaction, he's a creep and likely a chaser.
I want to be another person to affirm that you are NOT overreacting. That person has no right to touch you in any way, and the creepy talk only makes it worse. 

I've had similar and worse, shock from what happened kept me from reacting how I should have. 5 minutes later I realized I should have loudly called them out, and in one case punched them. That shock delay is where I feel that ""am I overreacting"" thought comes from.
I hope you feel better, that stuff isn't fun.
Super very creepy. I’m so sorry you had to deal with that
You have been sexually assaulted. Report him to organizers and to the police. Full description and any details you remember are vital.
Ew, what a creep! You’re definitely not over reacting, that’s super weird!
What a shitty person, and no you’re not overreacting, he was fucking out of line smh
Omg, just hearing about it makes my skin crawl. What an absolute creep. I'm so sorry that happened to you.
I am so sorry that happened to you. Completely inappropriate you are totally justified in your feelings
I've had unwanted physical contact from others several times in various settings so far in my life. It sucks...  I truly am shocked every time. Like what is wrong with them? Raised by wolves? Alien?  Or are they THAT out of touch with what is considered acceptable behavior??
Definitely not overreacting. The guy is a certified creep.
Not over reacting.

Nobody likes to be touch by a stranger, especially at a civil rights event like Pride. 

A terrible irony.
Probably a chaser sadly in Lgbt event they are sometimes these people

It's easy to spot them with time

They misgender, they don't really know what they are talking about, they use old term like transsexuals or things like this

They are just here because they are attracted in a sexual way in general

You need to avoid them the most of possible

That's sad but this kind of person do this
This dude sounds like a real piece of shit. Several major violations of boundaries and personal space with a total stranger, there is absolutely no call for any of it. You aren't over-reacting, I'm sorry it happened.
I'd have recoiled so hard at the hair touch that the belly poke would never have happened, assuming I even let anyone get close enough to touch me in the first place. Don't blame you at all for feeling really gross by it. I have autism , so my skin crawling right now just thinking about an older guy with boundary issues touching my belly button. I cant even touch my own belly button without it feeling REALLY weird! 😖
Had similar issue at my workplace, guy thought he was being funny by grabbing my ear lobe and then touching my boob.. some older guys have no sense.
Not over acting at all. The dude is a douche bag.  People like that shouldn’t be there. And obviously, the org that he is with didn’t train him.
ew, fuck no :( I'm sorry girl
I’m sorry this happened. With my attitude, I would’ve smacked his hand or punched him in the face. I’m FtM but not passing so older guys still talk to me like that every now and then and it is CREEPY! They’ve been able to get away with it because before the millennial generation, women were taught to be docile. I had a conflicting upbringing. On one hand, I was taught to shut up, but also open my mouth if need be. Because of it, I have such bad anxiety and most of the time my wife has to handle it because I will shut down. It also doesn’t help I have adhd and autism. IF this ever happens again, and I pray to Odin it doesn’t, start screaming. That will knock the person for a loop and allow you to gain attention to what he is doing and give yourself time to get distance.
Yeah idk about where you live but pride in Brazil is a fucking cesspool. I went once and was horrified. Never again.
That sucks and I’m sorry. It’s sadly common for women. It’s hard to speak up in the moment, but I watched a lot of videos of women beating up men who groped them and it gave me the confidence to speak up. It’s easy to be quiet, but it only serves to make the assaulter more comfortable. Hopefully this never happens again, but if anyone makes you uncomfortable you have every right to speak up and if they try and downplay it make them know it’s not gonna be easy for them. Good luck.
Sadly, this shit happens to me all the time. Usually from older white dudes. It’ll be an arm grab, a poke, hand on the small of my back, etc. It gets really fucking old. I’m sorry you had to deal with this at pride of all places. That’s supposed to be our safe space.
I just went to my first pride parade yesterday and there had to be like 250k people there. I was also encountered by some people that made me a bit uncomfortable. When the petition guy approached me I just told him I just moved to LA and wasn’t registered to vote. There wasn’t much else to say at that point. The guy before him though was trying to get me and my friend to guess how much it cost to go on the Ferris Wheel and standing a bit too close and it kinda rubbed me the wrong way.  I thought he was the person running it, but was just some random dude that wanted to talk to two cus women waiting in line, I guess. I’m not the best socially, but it definitely felt off. Luckily he didn’t try to touch me. 

I’m so sorry you went through that and unfortunately think this probably has happened to several other people at these events. This is assault and you are valid. People should really just not touch people they just met at a social gathering especially when presenting under professional circumstances. That’s so creepy. I hope you can self soothe and parent and know that you’re away from harm. Comfort yourself however that presents to you and definitely talk it out with someone you feel safe around.
What that person did was technically assault
🤣 I have creepy old guys constantly calling my darling,sweetie, and making me feel uncomfortable as fuck. It's part of becoming a girl
I'm so sorry for you. Can you tell us where this happened?
sign a petition or was he just collecting names and addresses for his own purposes? he definitely sounds creepy.
Thank you. That’s what I thought but I didn’t want to claim that if I didn’t have a right to on this one
It's actually battery. Assault is a wrong act causing someone to fear harm. Actual touching without consent is battery. So both assault and battery happened here.
Assault is being in fear of an un-consented-to touching of an insulting or provoking nature. What OP experienced was actually battery, namely the actual touching, which is worse, and in this case, reeeeeallllly gross.
You described it so so well. It took me a second to even process what had even happened because it was so unexpected. I feel like I should have spoken up but I know I couldn’t have in the moment. Thank you
Ugh I wish I had taken a picture of him before I left. Unfortunately I’m really bad with faces and I don’t think I’d be able to give any information specific enough to avoid someone else getting profiled who isn’t involved
Thank you for sharing your experience and advice. I’m sorry you have to experience that even as a man. I definitely can relate to the anxiety making it more complicated though. I’m really glad your wife is able to support you in that way as well!
Fear has nothing to do with either definition. Battery is more about violence and harm as opposed to sexual assault which could be any inappropriate touching the victim does not want to occur/did not consent to.
What I cited is literally the historic legal definition of Assault: being put in fear of receiving an unconsented to touching of an insulting or provoking nature. 

The crime merges into Battery when the touching (*any* touching; not just violent ones) takes place. One may be battered by a nothing more than a tap on the shoulder if the other requisite elements are present. 

Sexual Assault is an entirely separate crime with separate additional elements. 

Having prosecuted all of these crimes, they’re forever seared into my brain.
Well you may live somewhere different than OP but I’ve never heard of anyone saying they were in fear of being touched so that meant they were assaulted.
That is exactly how Assault would be pled in an arrest warrant or criminal complaint all over the country. It is a legal definition literally hundreds of years old. 

OP, having been touched in an un-consented to insulting or provoking manner, was a victim of misdemeanour Battery in virtually any jurisdiction in the U.S.
the common usage of assault is that, but in most places the legal definition is different — that’s what the other commenters are talking about. Sexual assault is — in the US — often referred to as sexual battery or criminal sexual conduct, with variation between states.

Would it be wrong of me to make a misgender jar when I get my own apartment?	"I've seen some people doing a ""put a quarter in this jar every time you misgender me"" which is think is really cool and I wanna do that. But is it irresponsible of me to do? 

I mean, it's my own apartment, I should be treated as *I* want in *my* apartment, but would it be disrespectful to my parents? I feel like they'd just find it stupid and that they'd be angry with the idea. But I kinda like the idea. I mean, if you have the energy to misgender and deadname me in my own home, might as well charge you for it. It's my home, I should feel safe. 

Is it wrong if I make that jar?"	"Even if you didn’t feel comfortable enforcing it, or people take it as a joke, I think it gets the point across. 
“I don’t have cash.” 
“Then I guess you better stop”

When I was a kid there was a swear jar. And no one was offended when it was brought up. it was seen as a polite, joking way to say “hey stop doing that.”
It served as a physical reminder.
Do it. 

I should do it too but I still live at my mom's and I'll just make her and my sister broke. They probably won't gonna respect it anyway and keep misgendering me-

Yeah I'm sorry for venting here just do it and I'll deal with my shit
I think its fair.

But also I would put a quarter in each time I misgender myself lol. When it gets full (which probably would be fast) maybe go do something really gender affirming with it like getting a manicure.
It’s stupid rude and disrespectful to misgender someone let alone in your own home. It’s not wrong I’m gonna put one in my house
I like the idea. It's like a deescalated version of the air horn
I charged my mom $5 on Venmo a while ago and she’s gotten a lot better since
If they’re going to disrespect you in your own home, they can learn it comes with a cost. Do it, IMO. Maybe increase the price the more they do it.
Calling someone out on being disrespectful, living your life as you want, and being comfortable in your own home are not disrespectful and anyone who tries to tell you otherwise is manipulating you
Do it. Your place. Who cares if your parents get angry about it. If they don't want to pay the fee, they won't misgender you. Simple as that.
I can tell your intent is to positively change their behaviour so I’m all for it 😊. That said, it might be a good idea for the proceeds of the “misgenjar” to go to a trans charity or something super positive that doesn’t seem like you’re profiting off it. Didn’t see anything about the proceeds on your post and I think it’s worth considering :)
Your house, your rules. If your parents don't like it they can leave
I like the idea
Do it. My wife (then girlfriend of several years) and I did this to break her habits. Every time she messed up, I got a dollar. I made quite a bit before she finally got it down. Rarely do I ever get a dollar now.
ur apartment ur rules
Absolutely not, go for it!
you should absolutely make that jar
Nah once they walk into your house you're their judge, jury, and executioner. If they don't like it they can get tf out
Its not wrong. If they purposely misgender you, in your own home. They deserve to be out a few dollars. And you deserve payment for it, you deserve to be treated correctly. 

Also the trouble of giving out money will make them feel a tad more stupid and silly to be misgendering you. Especially in your *home*.
I suggested a jar like this to my parents and they went absolutely off at me, I was only joking but they got so mad at the idea of a *misgender jar*
I feel like people would think you’re trying to profit from them making mistakes, or that, worse, you’re only pretending to try to make them feel bad or something. I don’t go out of my way to remember mistakes friends make, or even usually mean things people say intentionally. I think seeing a jar with a bunch of coins in it and knowing that each coin represents a time someone misgendered you will make you feel less confident.
Only a quarter?  I would be insisting on $10
If you've got problem people in your life, what's to stop them from seeing that as a ""fee"" for treating you like garbage?  Plunk a fiver in the jar and go to town.
  
Better to either get an air horn and honk at them when they misgender you, or simply eject them from your life.  You deserve people that respect you in your life, and the people who won't respect you, don't deserve you.
Only do it if its on purpose, don't charge people for genuine mistakes, but if its for people doing it on purpose then imo it's a good idea
no this is obnoxious.
I feel like that’s so toxic for yourself. Why do that to yourself? What’s the reasoning behind it? Start enforcing the correct pronouns and name, why just take peoples shit?
I find it a stupid idea. Its a reality that for some  people its hard to adjust and they usually do it by accident. Make them feel bad by telling them off... but a swear jar is trivializing it and just a dumb idea ? Then they laugh about it probably also.. because ooops. Swear jar. Teehehhe

You really want a reminder when you empty that how many times you were hurt ?

I show people that it hurts me and i want them to not make a big deal out of it when it happens. Correct and move on. This is the opposite.
It's genius, especially in your own home
That’s actually really fucking smart honestly
Put it outside the door and if someone complains about it close the door after them
They'd be angry at you for trying to motivate them to respect you? Wouldn't there be reason to be angry at them for disrespecting a minority?
nah that’s absolutely based, i’m stealing this idea when i get my own place
I used an air-horn but you do you
Personally, I wouldn’t like to have something like that. Seeing or getting money from there would only make me feel invalidated
Sounds like a good way to get people to stop coming to your apartment.
If they don’t have cash make sure you put your venmo on the jar. Or send a venmo request every time they do it.
I feel like they'd do the same with me. Especially my sister, she doesn't give a fluff about using my correct name and pronouns. 

Don't be sorry, it's okay! I'm always up for a talk if you want to 😊
If rhey miss their money they will learn faster ^^
Nah, such thing's most likely happen on accident (like when it's around a week ago you came out) or will always lead to arguing which most likely will lead to throw them out of your home..why not skipping that crap and directly kicking them out.
Nah its not rude at all.

Going along with lies or delusions is not rude.

Lying is rude
Exactly what I was thinking
Honestly, that much of an overreaction would make me more determined to do it.
For me, I think I’d shake the jar each time. Then the sound could become pavlovian.
I think that would solidify it even more. Especially if they didn’t check their phone until they got home. Another reminder
True- 
But I don't think they will agree to pay me- 
I mean, I'm 14 so-
I like that a lot
It will get the point across
its like the equivalent of using a spray bottle when your cat gets up on the bench.  
Just keep calling them out on it.   
Even if they don't pay you, just keep the receipts. record every instance until they pay.   
And title it something like, Mental anguish jar (by way of misgendering) to really hammer home that they are doing harm."	sacgr4	trans	388	0.98	2022-01-22 21:21:40
[FtM] Just got misgendered and deadnamed by my whole family during christmas...	"So yeah, pretty much all in the title. 

It was my first christmas out to my family.(I've been out to them since september) I can't say they rejected me or sayed anything transphobic but still... I took my distance from them for nearly 3 months and I thought they had plenty of time to adjust and try and make an effort to call me Larry and to use he/him pronouns... But nooo thats too hard, apparently.

I couldnt even correct them because of the holy christmas spirit you know. I didnt felt like I even had the right to feel irritated. I didnt even had the energy to do so. 

So here I am, silently crying in my bed, feeling like an orphan who will never belong anywhere... I'm sick and tired to pretend to be someone else. But at the same time I don't really know who I am and it scares me. 

All my friends are busy partying with their own families and I dont want to ruin their moment. Most of them are offline anyway. Right now I just need comforting words from strangers on the internet. 

Thanks in advance and sorry for the spelling / grammar mistakes, I'm french."	"Hey, we’re here for you, Larry. We might be strangers on the internet, but we’re also *you*. 

We’re the deadnamed, we’re the marginalized pronouns, we’re the ‘mentally ill’, we’re the ones who are told to ‘sit on it and pray’ because we don’t fit a narrative, we’re the dysphoric and the displaced…

…you can always come to us, bro. We’re your family, now.
I'm so sorry man. That is really rough. Sending love and virtual hugs your way sir. 💜💜💜
I am sorry this happened to you.  Just know that you are valid and loved.
Yeah. I get that. I haven't told my parents about changing my name yet... But let me grab the ship canons and the bombs and hit the sea! 🔪 oh, and then hang the trans flag up on the ship!
I hope you feel better! Family can be shit sometimes, but then you realize that they are actually trying...unless there just actual shit. Then we send all the battle ships and the battle boats and declare war. 😀
I’m sorry you’re having a hard time Larry :( maybe by next year things will be better 💙
You are valid ❤️
I’m really sorry about that Larry, I hope they’ll come around eventually <3

Merry Christmas
If christmas means you're not allowed to upset them, doesn't it also mean they have to put a little effort in to being kind to you?

If they can't even get your name right, they're the ones who should be feeling bad.

I really don't have any respect for families that emotionally blackmail people into accepting abusive treatment.

Larry, I'm sorry but your family sucks.
I understand your frustration, truly, but it typically takes people longer than that to adjust, especially if this is the first time they've seen you since you came out.

Correction is key, I think. I start with very gentle nudges/corrections, and as irritating as it is, it really is best to try to be patient with people who are trying.
Look, Larry, this might sound like a punch. You be out just might not be enough. It can be really hard for some, especially older folks, to assimilate what is happening, like ""ok, she does not see herself as she? What does this mean? What will happen? What she wants with it"", this things can be hard to understand, and you, as a very nice and polite man, shall be there and take some misgender. Hell i can even go as far to say some people need to see you as a male, physically speaking, visually speaking, to have the click ""AAAH, that's what she said on beign a male"". Im using she/her to represent their thoughts. You know im not willing to hurt you, gentleman. And the fact they did not show interest on hurting you, like, seems they are not willing to bring any harm, just might be the case. Heads up, my friend. 

I know this for personal experience, and im not saying they are right, Larry, but life is not fair.
Je suis désolée pour ta famille de merde. T’es jamais seul mon vieux 🏳️‍⚧️. De plus, ils n’ont pas le droit d’ignorer les besoins primaires d’un proche pendant qu’ils célèbrent la naissance d’un martyr représentant l’amour, la compassion et l’altruisme. 

M’envoies une message si tu veux parler! J’ai tellement envie de pratiquer mon Français ❤️
Merry Christmas, Larry. ❤️👊🔥🌈

You are important. You are worthy. You deserve to be treated with love and respect and kindness.
Hey, I just wanted to say that it is really scary to feel unsure of who you are, I get scared too, but I feel like accepting yourself as a trans person is a sign that you know yourself a lot more than you realize. It's complicated and confusing and upsetting or however else you might feel, especially when you aren't getting a whole lot of support from your family, but I just wanted to point that out. You will continue to find yourself.
Same
Hey, Larry. I understand how you feel. I came out to my dad, and even though he’s supportive I still get misgendered and deadnamed.

Sending you virtual hugs, man. The trans community is here for you. :)

You’re not alone, and you’re 100% valid! <3
I am so sorry. Please know that you are not alone, and you DO belong.  I think most of us have felt we’d never belong anywhere for at least part of our lives.  I know I have.  I’m an old woman now, and it took me a while, but I’m happily part of a completely loving and accepting family I’ve made for myself now.  You will find your tribe, too. And we are here for you in spirit, despite not knowing you in person.
relatable.
I’m sorry Larry that’s just awful by them.
I've been out since last August and my family still won't use he/him or call me Billie 😬
I support you, Larry ❤️
I’m sorry you had to experience this. You deserve to be treated better - to be respected for who you are.
sorry that happened man, but youre our brother always. youll always have a family in us
Bonsoir Larry. Comment ça va. Je suis désolé tu sentir indésirable. Nous serons ta famille. 

My French isn't the best but I try. Bonne Année.
You belong, just not with them, and it's their fault not yours. It's okay that you don't know who you are, you have plenty of time to work that out and there's no pressure.

You're not going through this alone, almost our entire community knows how you feel. It doesn't matter who you are or what your family says, you've us with you. 

You're always gonna have the trans community as a plave to belong to, and you won't ever be alone. Keep going on, you're not at fault
The “holy Christmas spirit” works both ways. Should they not be particularly attendant to your needs this time of year? Is the correct name or pronoun to dear of a present?
Ok my french is wack but for the fun of it

Mon Noël était exactement le même mais essayez de l'ignorer. C'est difficile mais n'abandonne pas.
N
Thank you sooo much it feels good to know I'm not alone <3
Jesus I loved this reply. Do you mind if i borrow it for when other trans people feel dysphoric as well ?
that was beautiful holy shit
Thank you very much <3
Thanks a lot <3
There's only one last thing to say : 

YAAAAAAAAARGL !
Honestly I don't know if they are trying or if they just don't care. I've got troubles speaking out to them about it anyway... 
But I would love to go with the battle ships ! I've always dreamt of being a pirate !
I hope so ! (But if not I won't give them another chance...)
Yeah I know but I'm still in the process of unlearning all this ""family is sacred"" bullshit  ...
Of course they need time but like... all my friends got it instantly and immediately corrected themselves before I could say anything. I can't see why it's so hard for some people and not for others. 

(Okay most of my friends are queer, I'm biased !)
Oh merci c'est super gentil <3 
J'y penserai, promis ! Mais ton français est déjà très correct, félicitations ! Ce n'est pas une langue facile...
Thank you so much ! That helped a lot <3
Thanks ! It means a lot <3
Thanks a lot ! I'm slowly building a new family as well. It's really good to see that a brighter future is still possible. 
I wish you the best of life, my lady <3
Merci beaucoup ! Bonne année à toi aussi ! 
And very nice try, I appreciate it :)
You're soooo right !
Merci beaucoup très cher ! 

Also I'm sorry you had to go through the same experience... I hope soon we'll be able to enjoy Christmas again !
Ok, but make sure you bring it back with a full tank and don’t stay out too late! 💝🏳️‍⚧️💝
Np. This is not an easy journey.  But there is a light at the end of the tunnel.
Oh, it's not easy.

But you're valid, and your feelings are valid.
Yeah that and age. Much easier to adjust.
It gets really frustrating
Merci ☺️ j’espérais que mon prof avait partagé ton avis. 

J’ai une idée, tu peux m’inviter à ta fête de Noël l’année prochaine et s’il y a la moindre trace d’intolérance, je serais prête au combat. 

Je suis athée, donc le Saint-Esprit peut se faire foutre
Of course! I hope things get better
One day.
Yes mommy ;)

I'm about to fucning UWU just reading this wtf
UWU"	rohk2v	trans	391	0.98	2021-12-25 21:11:15
I got misgendered today and it felt so much worse than normal	"I'm out to my instructor at my college class (he's cool) and we were doing practical stuff today for the class and I was with one of my friends and my instructor said to my friend ""what is she doing"" from across the room. Nobody really used she/her for me except my parents (I'm out to them but they won't use them). I'm just not used to hearing it and it made me feel really weird. I don't pass by any means but it hurts when people who know misgender me. I know accidents happen but bro do I feel bad now. Then after I'd been feeling super dysphoric all day I came home and my parents got on a call with my sister and they were using feminine words for me the whole time and I just wanted to crawl into a ball in my room and cry. I'm so tired of not being a guy and not being allowed to go on hormones. I'm just tired. Can someone tell me it's ok. Call me a boy. Literally anything I feel so bad right now.

tl;dr I was super dysphoric all day and my parents and college instuctor misgendered me."	"That sucks, bro. It hurts even when the nicest most well meaning people mess up. You'll be alright though. It'll get better and some day these things will be a distant memory.
You will be ok. I'm really sorry that happened to you and I can't imagine the pain that must have caused you. But also it makes me think what if the instructor is trying to not out you if you are not yet out. I'm sure you are a wonderful boy to be around and I really do want to believe that the instructor just wanted to do what he thought was best for you.
Good day Mr Man-boy-sir, 'tis nice to see a gentleman on this fine day *tips hat in your direction* please keep up being such a lovely lad!
I understand that shitty feeling though what kinda sucks is I'm use to it, it happens often for me, so I'm sorry about that, when someone does that it makes you feel bad because it's your identity we're talking about and that identity is a huge part of you
and also we trans people have to stick together I understand you pain, let the pain of us trans people unite us as one, all I wanna say is I've struggled because all I've wanted is to be accepted as a woman and because I know the pain of bot being accepted as the gender I identity with I wanna say that if you need to vent at all the rest of the community has got your back because we all understand that pain, you're just as much as a boy as I am a girl and I get it bro it's tough when people neglect who you are or just don't understand but just know that in this community you'll always have a place where you can find yourself at home
Happens to me at work. I hate taking the time to tell every single co-worker my pronouns bc I don't pass. By now most people know my pronouns (I transferred to my current store in December) But I'll have people randomly call me she to another coworker and it's like a train hits me, and then I don't want to correct them either because it's usually someone I've never even told. I also get misgendered at home constantly
tldr you aren't alone
it always hurts. but especially when it’s someone who uses the correct ones most of the time. at least in this case you could give them the benefit of the doubt and say they just slipped up.
it's a horrible feeling man, I'm so sorry
People still misgender me today, it sucks even after 4 years.
I find that the worst misgendering for me is in class. I’m in class with about 90 people. They all know that I’m trans, all of my classes are with the same 90 people so we’re close. When the professor misgendered me I was devastated and humiliated. Something about it happening in a room full of people and feeling like I couldn’t stop her lecture to correct her. And feeling like it’s hard to correct her in front of a room of 90 people. It’s especially disempowering, IMO, to have it happen in that context. I feel for you, OP.
Its okay bro. I feel ya. Im sorry for the crap that happens to you.
Yeah man, I know it's hard, nobody (except for close friends) calls me the correct things as well. I can't wait to get on hormones either
Hey man, heard a quote that might help. Obvi being appropriately gendered is the goal, but the quote goes:

“If it's out of your hands, it deserves freedom from your mind too. ""There is no use worrying about what you can't control. Just let it be. You will be just fine.""
I had something similar happen to me, I’m not out to people yet, the only people that know I’m trans are my few friends, and my mom, but I was at college, and my instructor was talking about hypnosis. I don’t believe in hypnosis, I think it’s a hoax, but anyway. I went to ask him a question, and I guess he couldn’t see me very well, and asked me if I was a sir or a ma’am, I know I did it to myself but I replied with “it’s sir” and felt super dysphoric all day yesterday :(. Anyway dude, I hope things get better for you, and I hope your parents warm up to knowing that you are indeed a boy, because that’s what you want to be, and that’s what you are. :)
I'm adopting you as my brother! No not a choice!
You are my litte brother now!
You'll be okay!
Drink lots of water!
I love you bro ❤️
The only time it bothers me is when it's somebody in the know. It's really bad when it's professionals like doctors and nurses who absolutely know and don't care. How do you trust your life to people like that? This is why our health suffers so much as a community. Happened to me again last week. 25yrs of non-stop abuse from one hospital.
I’m sorry man, I understand, don’t worry things will get better, keep your head up bro.
The 'mask slip' misgenderings always hurt the worst, because it reveals how they think of you internally, and that they're just putting their speech through a filter when they gender you correctly. 

I'm sorry that happened to you, fella. I know how much it sucks.
Well someone just deleted their comment saying it's my fault that I'm getting misgendered and I should just try harder. Man why didn't I think of that.
Don’t be mad on them. If someone misgenders me, I take it into account. They misgendered me because I didn’t look as I desired to be perceived. Who’s there to blame? Me. Not they. No one’s gonna care about our emotions and feelings. Forget it. Try harder, make it right and you’ll reach the star.
A girl at University told me while early on transition “I don’t perceive you as a girl”. She said it so calmly. I thought OK. I worked harder and after some time a customer where I worked said about me “Guys, there’s an angel next to you”.
Yeah I know he means we'll which is nice at least. My parents don't try with my pronouns though which sucks. But yeah I know things will get better thanks!
Thank you and he didn't mean to so it's all good. I'm out to the class and sometimes he just forgets. My friend tried to correct him but he didn't hear. If they do correct him he corrects himself immediately. I probably should have put that in the original post😅
𝘛𝘪𝘱𝘴 𝘩𝘢𝘵 𝘣𝘢𝘤𝘬 Why thank you ma'am I hope you have a lovely day yourself
Yeah I'm sorry it happens often to you too. It does suck but hopefully someday we'll get to a point where we're gendered correctly.
Yeah that's true thanks I'm glad I have a family here :)
Yeah it's really embarrassing having to correct people on pronouns all the time. All the people in my class know I'm a guy but like half of them still misgender me on purpose. My teacher's cool it's just hard when people try but mess up too because I want to be seen as a boy not just a girl with different pronouns. I'm sorry about your home life too. I wish people could just accept us but hey at least we have the community.
Yeah he's accepting he just messes up sometimes. It just really caught me off guard for some reason. I also miss my other instructor because he almost never messed up and it was really nice.
Thanks and yeah I don't have a super big class but we're pretty close because we spend a lot of time with each other. I don't think it would be as bad but half the class migenders me on purpose so it's hard when people mean well but forget.
Thanks that actually really helps :) Do you know where it's from?
Ah man that's sucks to. It's really hard but it'll get better. And thanks :)
Thank you I'm happy to be your little brother I love you too❤️
I'm so sorry about your situation. Healthcare is supposed to be the place that's there for us but most of the time they end up hurting us the most. I don't know your situation but I hope you end up being able to switch hospitals.
Yeah that's what I think about. Like I know I don't look like a guy but it hurts when other people don't see you as one.
Ugh if that isn't the truth :< hurts like hell with family and having this happen, especially when you've been out for so long. Such a powerful hit from something so small :(
Oof
Ah I get it it's my fault I'm getting misgendered and I should just work harder because that's how it works😑
I'm glad and sorry for not realizing that you were out to your classmates as well. There goes my theory I guess.
it'll happen trust me when I say that one day there will be a time when the sun shines upon us my friend and we'll finally be free to just be the people you and I both know we were meant to be and in the end the result of all of it will be worth all the pain because we may not always have the support of others but we'll always have this community of people who does understand and want similar goals that we do for ourselves, and I genuinely hope you get to the point where you are seen as the man you know you are and I hope people give you nothing but the respect you deserve
So I found it on tiktok, but apparently it’s from an author named Ivan Nuru.
My dms are always open ❤️
That always sucks.  I have people like that around.  They don't do it meanly; they correct themselves and all, they get better and do it less frequently.  But I know that SHE means they see me as a girl.
And then the cis ask Why do you have to change your bodies and what you look like though?

This is why.
It's all good and yeah he messed up sometimes but he still cares which is cool. It's just frustrating when people mess up even if they don't mean to.
Awesome thanks!
Thank you :))
No I understand. I don’t get it because I’m not out yet but I understand.
You're welcome :)"	sucof3	trans	390	0.98	2022-02-17 01:50:35
Rest in peace Eden Knight	"(TW abuse, hate crime, suicide)

2 days ago, a transgender woman from Saudi Arabia posted her [suicide](https://twitter.com/cyberangelfaery/status/1634929690287779842?s=46&t=OcYhx7xF8-Bl3YK2SpJuCg) letter to twitter. She was a young trans woman that escaped Saudi to be able to live her life and transition but her leaving was not enough for her parents. 

Her parents hired PI in america to find her, “befriend” her, kidnap her and have her taken back to Saudi to her family where she faced abuse and was forced to detransition. She soon took her own life. I am so heartbroken to hear about such a disgusting thing happen to one of our own but even more heartbroken knowing she won’t get any media coverage. 

Things like this happen all the time in the middle east but she escaped. She felt freedom and love and acceptance only to have it taken from her. Her blood is on her parents hands, as well as the 3 accomplices who tricked her, stole her and forced her to go back to Saudi. 
Her death certificate has been published, deadnaming her and misgendering her. I am so sick. 

Please share her story. 
Please consider supporting [LGBT charities in the middle east](https://twitter.com/elierlick/status/1635372999200362497?s=46&t=OcYhx7xF8-Bl3YK2SpJuCg) who work hard to try and make this region liveable for us. 

Please take care of yourselves, my brothers and sisters and friends."	"This is messed up on so many levels that her birth givers would do that to such a beautiful girl.  First Brianna Ghey and now this?  This is just disgusting and disappointing.
This hurts wow. This is really fucked up but I think nothings gonna happen for Justice
Do we have any info on the PI or names of the people in the US who assisted them?
Rest in Power, Eden.




This is what Trans people suffer from in Middle East



This is why I'm suppressing myself and will never come out, yes I'm from Saudi Arabia.
Shit like this pisses me off so fucking much. People fucking suck so much and it's sickeningly vile.
An article with more information:

https://www.intomore.com/culture/forced-detransition-drove-a-young-trans-woman-to-suicide/

These people that coerced her into her death need to be punished. How many more innocent lives will they take before we get justice?
I keep seeing horrible news like these every damn day, and fucked up comments in social media celebrating things like this, it's just too much, too much hate
It’s incredibly evil.   The depth of depravity explicated by the actions of the parents and Michael is just massive.   I hope they are continuously tortured by the enormous black hole created by her death for the rest of their miserable lives.   I have no words to accurately describe my disgust, but that’s a start!
This fucking terrifies and disgusts me on so many levels that I can barely hold myself from puking
Isn’t that true evil? Aren’t these people as bad as they get?
Rest in power ✊
Eden was a friend, we weren’t close, but talking with her always brightened up my day. She was smart, hilarious and sweet, and so optimistic about the future she worked so hard to make for herself here in the US. And then Michael, Ellen, Bader and her parents stole that future away from her through deception and abuse.

Some of Eden’s closest friends have drafted a letter to send to your local representatives. It concerns a change to the law that could’ve saved Eden’s life. If implemented, the change could prevent LGBT people from dangerously homophobic and transphobic countries from being trafficked and coerced the way Eden was.

Please read it, and send to your local representatives. There are many, many other people in this world in a similarly dangerous position to Eden: https://docs.google.com/document/d/1pMyr-5Ua2t567Qr0qdcESNfy3_bMpHrG-ZQq66gPdIs/mobilebasic
Wow. You know, I was gonna do the same thing, but every time I tried anything on myself, it hurt too much. Sometimes the thought still comes up.
Actually just remove the saudi governemnt at this point
This is why I think some people aren’t fit to be parents
I would down vote this but didn’t. I am just so angry from this that I needed to vent without throwing my phone against the wall. 😠😢
And yet the same people who claim to be defenders of trans rights are also the first to defend Islam from any form of criticism.

Rest in peace and power, Eden. Shit like this should never happen.
Where is the parents response?
Just to let y’all know, atengesdal is a hate account here to troll us, he’s posting comments on other posts like “born a man will always be a man”, and I’ve reported him.
[removed]
i know that nothing will happen legally but i feel that queer issues especially in the middle east are always silenced. We need to let people know what happens, spreading the word of our injustices and ways to support the queer and trans community in the middle east are so important. so many suicides and deaths can be avoided with external support.
Its a big thing but the agency that was hired to take her back home in the middle east were she had parents who are abusive. The agency is run by Michael Pocalyko and Ellen Cole. The company is called SI or Speck SI (cannot remember all the details) and is in Virginia. 

Also I apologize for the bad grammar, my english is not that good.
It was Mike Pocalyko, he made all of his contact info and his home address available online too. So even if there isn't any legal justice, at least he won't be feeling safe for a while
Here is a story:

https://www.intomore.com/culture/forced-detransition-drove-a-young-trans-woman-to-suicide/
stay safe and please don’t let anyone be able to tie your online identity to your real person. take care.
be safe hbb, i wish for a future for us where we don’t have to hide ourselves in our homes. i hope you can leave and live your life happily in the future.
How can we best help you? Should we donate to organizations? Arrange for educational scholarships abroad? Try to send medications/hormones? What would help you the most? 

I didn’t know Eden or even of Eden. I first heard of her due to her Twitter message. It made me feel both angry, incredibly sad and also guilty. I think I could have set her up with immigration attorneys who would have been able to do something. I might be completely wrong though, why would anyone trust a stranger on the net? But I firmly believe that legal immigration to the US or some EU countries is possible even for those who overstay visas etc.
please stay safe
thank you for sharing the article. i hope that the americans involved face justice or any consequence for their disgusting actions but unfortunately, i know that her parents won’t be affected at all. if anything they will be praised by their community while her friends and lgbt folks in Saudi have no choice but to stay silent. breaks my heart.
I’ll never understand those kinds of people, like mate somebody just died. Whether you hate trans people or not it’s not something to celebrate
They talk about how we are the bad people here, but celebrating our deaths is totally not bad, bunch of hypocrites
what response? to my knowledge they haven’t been questioned or interviewed and and probably won’t ever be.
I already copied their entire comment history, lul. xD
Nah, those ain't parents.
Poeple like that don’t deserve to be called parents. Being a parent is a title you earn, and they lost it. Parents don’t hire a PI to kidnap their child in another country across the globe, parents love and respect their children for who they are.
They weren't parents.

Edit: poster, u/atengesdal, has transphobic comments in other lgbt subreddits. Report the account friens 💜🔮
Honestly my future is pretty unclear even though I came in terms with myself being trans, I'm still hesitant about transitioning (One of my own concerns is I'll have to give up on my dream being a father and having my own kids if I ever decided to transition) 

I don't really have knowledge about organizations, others might help.
Sending HRT to trans people in Saudi or Middle East is very dangerous for them (If they didn't confiscate the hormones in the way.), Trans people can't publicly come out there let alone transition.

I can't come out (and will never come out) to my family because I won't be accepted and will be considered an Immoral pervert if not disowned.
I love my family but being trans is something I have no control over and I'm not ready to part ways (yet).
As a thankful person I don't want to ruin the good memories and turn my life into hell when I'm (and my family) going though not so good times.

Same can be said to all Trans people in those countries even those who happened to have progressive/supportive families (which is less than 1% chance), are still not safe because of the society and country overall.

I don't know about educational scholarships (even though it's not a bad option) for me I found out I'm trans when I'm close finishing my Bachelors degree (which makes it harder for me)

I would say the best option possible is making Immigration to Canda/(Trans friendly) Europe easier with overstay visas and protecting them from any danger (from previous country/relations) 

US/UK are currently massive red flags...

I heared that Canda covers HRT costs for trans people, which might be an option for me if transitioning was my last resort.

Japan is also one of the options for me personally (I'm fortunate enough to know Japanese and will improve it later) because I heared people there are very accepting and welcoming while the government is supportive but extremely strict.

I would plan/prefer to immigrate there once I'm financially stable so I won't worry about myself there but Immigration/Asylum could always be an option if shit hits the fan or those who are unfortunate.



I would be happy if others provided more options.



TL;DR:

Immigration/Asylum with protection and overstay visas (and possible citizenship?) is the safest option probably.

Countries to Immigrate to (Feel free to add more or correcting me):

Canada - Germany- Japan (only if you can speak Japanese)
Speaking as an immigrant to the US familiar with he immigration system, just being from KSA would be a huge positive in an asylum application, because it is public knowledge that KSA executes or heavily persecutes people it considers to be ""deviants."" Certain states, like California and Minnesota, are very trans friendly. 

Of course, if DeSantis becomes president, he will use the power of the office to target those states. Only the SCOTUS could keep him in check. And I am not at all inspired by seeing so many trans people who unfortunately are convinced that ""Biden is just a blue Trump"" or that the two parties are the same. You'd think they'd understand that not voting against DeSantis is a vote for DeSantis and thus a systemic, organized program of persecution.
Sorry to take so long to reply but thank you so much for your thoughtful and detailed response. It sounds like you are well aware of your situation and the difficulties that are connected to your life situation. I agree with you that - presently - the only option for transition seems to be to abandon your current country and family. That’s really tough. Sadly, it’s a situation that so many around the world, even in developed progressive countries, are faced with. 

I don’t know anything about Japan but it’s an interesting option. I would guess that Thailand could be another one. In Europe, Germany and Spain seem to be the best. As for the US, don’t count out the whole country as there are major differences between states. Minnesota just became a trans refuge state and several of the coastal states are very progressive. I doubt that even if DeSantis did become president, he would be able to turn the whole country into Florida. While it may seem difficult to immigrate legally to either of these, there are always ways…

Either way, whatever you decide, please stay safe. That’s the most important thing and that goes for your mental safety/sanity as well. If things get bad, please remember that you can turn to this community and we will do our utmost to figure out resources and ways to help.
That's why moving/Immigrating to the US was never an option imo, America are facing a lot of problems and the rampant increase of Transphobia is the straw.

Also Trump vs Destantis is literally Trash vs Garbage.

Like I said I'm only Immigrating if transitioning became my last resort, thus I'll seek Asylum.
>the only option for transition seems to be to abandon your current country and family.

It's not easy and not ready for it yet but I'll do it if I have to, need to secure myself financially first.

>I don’t know anything about Japan but it’s an interesting option. I would guess that Thailand could be another one.

I always wanted to visit or even live in Japan even before finding out I'm trans and I'm already learning Japanese so it could be an option for me.
Japan is one of the safest countries in the world and probably the safest trans-friendly country in Asia.
South Korea is also safe from what I heard, along with Japan they are more in the acceptance side.

I'm not that interested in Korea tbh but will definitely give it a visit, Thailand is one of the options if I'm going for FFS nor SRS (I would recommend to know someone who's Thai so they can help you from getting scammed or other stuff.)



>As for the US, don’t count out the whole country as there are major differences between states. Minnesota just became a trans refuge state and several of the coastal states are very progressive. 

To be frank, I pretty much lost hope or any will to move or visit US weather I was trans or not... A lot of terrible things happened last decade and the recent Transphobia was the cherry on top.

I get it not all states are the same but I can't guarantee or risk in that situation and living in the US is expensive, If trans citizens are struggling then how about trans immigrants/refugees?

>Either way, whatever you decide, please stay safe. That’s the most important thing and that goes for your mental safety/sanity as well. If things get bad, please remember that you can turn to this community and we will do our utmost to figure out resources and ways to help.

My future was always unclear but with coming out It got even more vague... Whatever my decision will be I will always plan for it.

Thank you so much for your supportive message, it did lift me up today."	11rg444	trans	378	0.98	2023-03-15 00:30:15
People love femboys so much, until they're trans.	"I'm a feminine, ftm gay guy. Nobody sees me as a real man, even suspect some of my friends of this because of misgendering. I've been feminine, not really attractive, my whole life and i can't get on t because of my age and side effects.
When I told people I'm also gay mlm, with zero attraction to girls, i just know they shit on my identity, they just see me as a cishet girl with extra steps, even tho I've tried to make it clear thousands of times I've never seen myself as a girl. My feminine appearance is not something I can change, and i don't want to get rid of the clothes i like.
My point is, everyone praises cis femboys for dressing feminine and ""fighting gender norms"",but the second you, as a trans guy, show any little sign of feminity, an army of cishets will feel so attaked.
Not to mention how annoying cis quirky ""ally"" girls form tiktok are. I noticed how their ""go off handsome king!!"" kind of comments stop the secon you don't act like a little soft kid who tries everything to be attractive and masculine."	"That really sucks that you're dealing with this shit.

Performative queerness is, unfortunately, very real, as you're showing us. Cisallohetero society is unfortunately hanging over all of us. And recently I've been seeing queer people use it as a hammer against other queer people, which is so unhelpful.

Just sucks. 

Wish I could help.
Have you heard of r/ftmfemininity ? I know it doesn’t erase what you’re going through, but I think it’s helpful to have a community of guys going through what you are
I'm also a feminine transmasc, I feel you. :(
Trans mend don’t owe you masculinity, trans women don’t owe you femininity, enbies don’t owe you androgyny, be you
I’m mtf and that word is still used to misgender me, I hadn’t even *considered* how it affects transmascs. Awful origins of the word aside it almost feels like it’s continued existence perpetuates the existence of gender norms… a guy can’t just dress or act feminine, there has to be a label, and the label implies that it’s not normal in a sense?

The situation you find yourself in absolutely sucks, bordering on transmedicalism. You’re valid, and i hope things’ll get better for you :(
I’m a trans tomboy, I feel you
Yeah a lot of trans ""allies"" only support you when you fit their idea of what a transmasc/transfem/enby person should act like and when you don't they start saying you're not being trans the right way
Yep its the same way people love a tragedy about a little boy whose abusive mom forces him to wear dressed because she always wanted a daughter until its a little trans boy because that's to be expected for us.
That's true, I'm a feminine trans boy and people always say ""You're not a real boy if you dress like that"", while they will go crazy of ""breaking gender norms"" if they see a cis femboy. It really shows that they just respect you if you fit in the stereotypes of a cis boy, if you are feminine and trans you ""are just faking it"" and ""aren't a real boy"". 

I hope you can get the respect that you deserve on being what you want to be, good luck.
I believe you! You are a man in my eyes.
You're not responsible for whatever it is that reminds them of a girl. You're a boy ❤️
There are of course also people who accept you just the way you are! 🤗 I see you, brother! ✊
Tik tok with any community sucks. Tik Tok business model celebrifying people (which is just giving them complexes, inflated egos, and brain rot) no matter the amount of misinformation they peddle.  I could extend this to any social media platform. Even here with the Karma system, but Tik Tok ought to be the worst in many cases.  


Ask most diagnosed DID systems about systems on Tiktok, and you won't hear the end of it.  


Seriously, don't ask me. I will rant.
are you me? did i post this in my sleep?
hey going through the same thing here fellow feminine trans fella:’)
Where do people love femboys?

Only on the internet maybe.In the real worls they are bullied and harassed
I'm also ftm. I dunno is it weird that if I was a cis man, I'd wanna be a femboy, but as a trans man the thought of putting on a skirt just makes my blood boil with self hate?? *Trans confusion intensifies*

Maybe my thoughts will change after starting hormone treatment (or after surgery maybe?)

just got in a fight with my dad who claims he’s not transphobic	"my dad just yelled at me for being upset about him defending jk rowlings transphobia and then told me to stfu cus he was talking to “his son” (my brother, for reference i identity as male) towards the end of the argument he started to defend terfs as a whole and said that im “being unfair by not understanding their point of view.” He’s literally never stood up for womens rights or even mentioned it, only when it also includes being transphobic. He also misgendered caitlyn jenner multiple times, no matter how many times I corrected him. He’s never gendered me correctly and has only used my real name a couple times. 



update: just fully got disowned by him and am now living with my mom"	"Not to be that person but I think your dad is a lost cause. Hope you can move out soon.
Yeah get outta there and never speak to him again. If he ever misgenders yyou, misgender him right back.

“You’re being unfair by not understanding their view” yes the people who hate my existence and don’t think I should exist ah yes I love to understand their view I think he just sounds upset he can’t be properly transphobic else he will look like a bad parent 

Also f jk Rowling like just screw her
im hopefully gonna go live with my mom soon, shes much more supportive and just way nicer overall. However the area she lives in is very dangerous and she never really leaves the house, plus i do online school so I never have anything to do when im there which Ive noticed is really bad for my mental health. So i have to choose between this shit or sitting in my room bored and dissociated out of my mind everyday.
I don't understand why this is always what people say, some people don't have the resources to just get out and cut people off
Is it unsafe for lgbt or just unsafe in general? There may be a way to cope depending on the answer that'll help living with her
I meant get out when you are able to.
unsafe in general. Lots of gangs/gun violence/crime/drugs and shit.

Boyfriend (ftm) and I's (mtf) shared euphoria moment at dinner	"Went out last night for dinner with my boyfriend. Had some great steaks, but the best part was when it came time to pay. I was planning on paying, but then he pulled out his wallet and grabbed the ticket. Had his deadname on the debit card, so we sat it in the middle of the table so the server didn't know who the card belonged to. The server had called him ""Sir"" earlier in the night, so we didn't know who he would give the card and receipt to. Server comes back to the table and hands me the card and receipt. He and I's faces both lit up, because his gender and mine were both validated in such a random moment. Was a really nice moment of euphoria we shared since he is ftm and I'm mtf.

I've been on estrogen and spiro since April 2020, but he's only been on testosterone for almost 2 months now. I have lived fully out as female for a year now. No going to the mens bathroom (except for the time I went into the mens room with him to help him feel more comfortable), and no shopping in the mens section, and I rarely ever get misgendered. Him though, he's still early into his transition, only having been on t for a few months. It was such a great moment of getting to see a completely random person validate his gender. From the beginning of dinner to the end, the server not once thought otherwise. My boyfriend's excitement and euphoria was radiating the entire rest of the night."	"AGH this is so cute.
Wow, what are the odds of that, your story is so cute
This is such an awesome story🥰…it makes me genuinely happy to hear and I hope there are many more stories like this to come ❤️
That's so cute. It really is a great experience when you pass for the first time.

Hope my fiancee and me can have a similar moment soon, sadly it is unlikely due to how hard it is and how long the wait list are in the UK, still fun to dream and hear of others achieving what we dream of

I imagine we will have plenty of these odd moments going forward and I look forward to every single one of them.

I family respects every trans person except me	"I really don’t get it. I’ve been out since I was 13, literally bagged up and threw away my old clothes, chopped all of my hair off, started T, and socially transitioned to the point where I was completely stealth for 2 years, and my family still treats me like I’m going through a quirky phase. 

My sister idolizes multiple trans celebrities, will threaten anyone who misgenders her trans coworker, and is an avid supporter of LGBT rights, and has trans friends she fully supports, but when it comes to me it’s like I never transitioned. They all ask me for advice on trans things, make sure to never accidentally put my binders in the dryer if my laundry gets mixed with theirs, and consider men who are attracted to me gay, but then they introduce me as “the family lesbian” and get mad when people “assume I’m a guy”

Has anyone else had this experience?? I feel like I’m going insane sometimes."	">I family respects every trans person

No they don't. They perform respect, but they don't actually have respect for those other trans people if that's the way they treat you.
This is... very strange. Have you ever confronted them about it/ask why they do this?
My sister would still aggressively gender me as my agab after I came out to her for years and has never apologized for it. She's big into performatively supporting LGBT people and now that I've socially transitioned she respects my identity but she refuses to apologize for the constant misgendering and gave me a laundry list of excuses when I told her it upset me. Idk family sucks. /:
Wow, I'd normally say that it's them talking the talk but not walking the walk.

But they're mostly walking the walk...?

What the fuck?

My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? Or they're SO good at faking allyism that they don't outright come off as transphobes. You have got to bring it up with them, that's the only way you can grasp what's happening in their heads.

Clearly they see you differently in some way. Why? Well that's what you need to figure out.

If this shit doesn't stop, I'd recommend cutting them off completely. Idk how old you are, but it seems you're either a young adult or nearly one. It's a tough world and economy and all that, so stay safe and stable. But if you can get away from them, that might be the only way.

Maybe it's the vindictiveness in me, but that would definitely show them there er of their ways. Hopefully it doesn't come to that! 

Much love, you deserve better my man. 👉✨
My family is the same. My sister will starts fights about someone trans from twitter being misgendered but keeps using my deadname and saying ""I don't have to use your name, right? it's just so ugly"". 
My mum also refused to use my name at all until I complained about my dad being transphobic (they are divorced and they compete to be the best). Then she used my name for a while but keeps using my deadname and excusing herself, and saying that she chose my deadname and she does not want to give it up. But she will proudly deffend trans people she meets at work.

Apparently, when we are family, we fall under different rules.
Family and old friends have been the worst in my experience, ditch them all as soon as you can, move somewhere fabulous and start a new life.
This was my grandmother for the LONGEST time!!! My grandma would try so hard to be respectful of other trans people (although she was never great at it but she visibly tried) meanwhile she would get MAD at ME if I very gently asked her to try harder in gendering me correctly.
Infact one time when I corrected her on my name she gave me the most evil smile and cooed out ""Well on your birth certificate~""

Now do I recommend doing what I did in retaliation? Not really; but it's what I did in response to my situation.

I stopped responding.
Dead name being called? Nope. Don't care how loud they scream or bitch or complain.
Call me dead name in public? I'd literally apologize to the person and tell them she was having a dementia episode when I knew she could hear me from a distance.
Buy me female clothes? Act insanely confused and kept putting them in her laundry everytime she snuck them in mine.

It was a l o n g and misrible battle but eventually she began having to respect me. If I don't respond until I hear my name, she has to use my name. If I act like I have no clue who she's referring to when she dead name's me to a stranger, she has to use my proper name to seem sane.

And eventually over time she began to actually see me as male, and although she still says some pretty offensive shit sometimes (for example yesterday she said I still have a 'female laugh' and that has created a huge amount of insecurity in me 🙄), she doesn't misgender or dead name me unless she is in a super mentally frazzled state (and it's very visibly a mental blep as she'll catch herself instantly and laugh at herself and ask why she said it)

So ... Yeah TLDR; Your family doesn't see you as male. You can either be a complete cock head (like me lol) or be passive and polite (which doesn't seem to be working in your situation.) It depends on how comfortable you are with conflict. Wishing you the best dude
My partners mother is the same, will respect my name and pronouns and some of his other friends but when it comes to him its constant misgendering and deadnaming and i do not understand it
People react very differently when its a spectacle on TV rather than a family member sullying their gene pool. And TV just got past the ""haha man in a dress"" spectacle and started this trend where every trans person is put on a pedestal because they're beautiful and an outspoken and are perfectly prepared to answer invasive questions without being caught off guard, and the unintended consequence is that if you don't fit that image then people feel the need to gatekeep so we don't make ""real"" trans people look bad and the irony is completely lost on them.
My parents and grandma are like this, they oo and ah at trans people in the media but at the same time have only made a handful of attempts to gender me correctly. They literally put up a banner saying 'Birthday Boy' and proceeded to misgender me.
>My only reasoning is they're irrationally afraid of losing you? 

I'd bet it's this. People do grieve for the loss of the brother/sister they *thought* they had and grew up with and it's hard on families to give up what they've known so deeply and closely. It is super easy to respect trans people you only know as trans, but when it's a family member people get weird, like all the hard shit is suddenly in their face.

Super worth talking to them about it IMO. I think they never really latched on to the idea of what happened or something. I feel like the other allyship isn't just performative and that they're just not fully grasping they need to treat a family member the same way, or they love you and it's hard for them to believe they're hurting you when they don't see it or feel it. It's one of those situations where it's like ""OP knows I love them, we're fine"".
I know this isn't an option for everyone, but ever since I could remember I would ask my mom what name she had picked if I had been a girl. She always said there wasn't one because she wanted a boy and wouldn't answer. Then when I came out to her it turned out that she did have another name picked. So my name is still a name my parents had chosen for me. 

That may not have been an option if I had a little sister. And depending on how young someone is, parents may be waiting to pick names until after the ultrasound, but I'm pretty sure parents think about both names before they get pregnant."	sv7v3v	trans	358	0.99	2022-02-18 03:36:23
Stop the VCCPA! Save trans youth in Alabama.	"I know this is something you might already know, but Alabama is soon to pass the VCCPA. If passed, it will make hormone therapy for trans youth a felony. From what I'm seeing, it will also make it a felony for therapists to affirm the gender of trans youth, basically forcing them to misgender their clients.

**THE SUICIDE RATE IN TRANS YOUTH NOT ACCEPTED BY FAMILY IS ALREADY 47%. THIS WILL RAISE IT.**

There isn't much we can do, but we can certainly try. Below, I've linked a [change.org](https://change.org) petition, already at nearly 200,000 signatures. Everyone, please sign it an do your part to save trans youth in Alabama.

Another thing we can do is spread this! Copy/paste this whole article and put it on every single LGBTQ+ subreddit you know. Spread it like Texas is spreading corona - really get it out there! The more people are aware of this blatant violation of rights, the more likely something gets done.

How can any sane democracy pass such laws. There is literally zero benefit from forcing things like that, other than pushing your egoistic personal beliefs, I think? Like WTF???

This is why the rest of the world has lost all faith in the US.
Alabama refuses to outlaw child marriage, but they’ll prevent teens from receiving effective treatment for gender dysphoria under the pretense of protecting kids. Disgusting.
Alabama needs to past a ""Mind Your Own Fucking Business Act"". Of course, This is the state where the state Supreme Court Chief Justice ruled that a woman could not have her kids because lesbians are unfit mothers....he was later fired

Really? I thought Montana was chill. Dang.
That’s what we thought about the mask mandate though, Alabama was the one Red state who extended it. They actually made me proud with that until I saw this. 

Nope. Ya’ll still nasty down there.

No, unfortunately. From what I can tell, this petition has made no impact whatsoever. If it passes, I'm going to what little faith in humanity I had left.

Is it normal for your therapist to deadname and misgender you on purpose?	I transgender male 14 have been trans for almost three years. I’m not out to my family yet and have gotten a therapist to deal with it. My therapist keeps misgendering and deadnaming me even after I’ve repeatedly told her my name and pronouns. It almost feels like she’s doing it on purpose. She also relates my gender to the bands she likes saying “Our interests change.” Like my fucking identify is not similar to you like Yellowstone. She keeps calling me stuff like “girly” WHILE I’m talking to her about my struggles being trans. I begged my mom to let me get a different therapist but I just started going to this one about two months ago and my mom gets telling me just to “Give it a try.” and it’s not like I can tell her why I want a different one. I just want to know, is it required by law for therapist to call their clients their biological name and gender? I’ve only gone to about 5 sessions since I’ve identified as trans (I used to go when I was 10.)	"I haven't been to a therapist since coming out, but this is definitely not normal. It shows that she doesn't take you seriously, and it's super unprofessional. I don't think there's a law about calling you by your legal name or anything.
Definitely sounds like a new therapist is in order
It’s not required by law and that therapist is absolutely transphobic. They are not helping you so I would calmly explain to your parents that your therapist is not being helpful and that you need a different one. If they ask why, just tell them the therapist had a hard time relating to you and made you feel worse after you saw them. Be firm and don’t feel the need to go into the fact your trans if you’re not ready to tell them
Tell your parents that you don't feel this therapist is a good fit. She doesn't really listen to you, or if she does, she doesn't understand what you're saying and respond in a way that you find helpful. It's completely normal to need to try a few different therapists before finding someone that you really click with. The ""therapeutic alliance"" is an important part of your treatment. They shouldn't discount or ignore it. 

Perhaps try searching the PsychologyToday database for trans friendly therapists in your area. Find some other reason that you think you might be more comfortable talking to those people, instead, just in case she asks. If you bring your mom some alternatives, so she can see that you are trying to engage with the therapeutic process, you just don't like THIS therapist, it might be easier to convince her.
Wrf, no, a therapist should not deadname you!
My therapist used to do this so I walked out and i’ve never looked back, no one should talk to you like that nor misgender you. Ever. Period. Get a new therapist
That’s a therapist that doesn’t actually want to help but will gladly take your money and waste your time
I would get a new therapist
Woah, this is not okay.

Like, my legal name is three syllables and what I’d get called as a kid when I was in trouble. I go by a shortened version. If my therapist repeatedly called me my full name after I asked them not to, I’d be out of there. I expect a therapist to call me what I want to be called. It’s a very basic sign of respect.

Therapy works when it’s a place you feel safe and respected. It’s work you do together with your therapist. Fit is one of the most important things with a therapist. 

Can you tell your parents that you don’t feel respected or heard by your therapist? That you want to keep giving *therapy* a try, but that this person is a bad fit? I promise, the office is used to handling bad fits between patient and therapist. It doesn’t (on its own) say anything bad about the patient or the therapist.
Sounds like an incompetent (perhaps even deliberately malicious) therapist.
It's absolutely not normal and you need to find a new therapist asap.
You need to change therapist ASAP. That is abuse.
Well your therapist does the opposite of what mine does. Let me explain:
In my therapist session, the first thing she did was asking for my preferred name and pronouns. She avoids calling things ""girly"" or ""manly"", because she knows it can make her clients uncomfortable (it doesnt have to do with it anyways), and talked to me who ive been out to, who i wanna out myself to in the future, and wether i wanna transition or not, and what i wanna do to transition (hrt, surgeries, etc.). 

She also gave me lots of information about the risks and effects on various medical trainsitioning steps, and the legal boundaries on them (e.g. you can get laser hair removal in the face after half a year of therapy). 

For context: I live in Germany. I am not aware of any legal duty to call clients or patients by their legal name, youre only required to use it in official documents (like a diagnosis or sth) as far as i know. 
However, even here, its hit or miss with therapists. This is the second therapist i am working with. The first one still called me by my preferred name and pronouns, but said it was ""useless"" to start hrt and it would have no effect whatsoever, and kept me waiting until the last session for the required documents for the endo, but canceled the last one.y first therapist also didnt respect privacy or HIPAA (or rather the German equivalent), as she randomly left the room while talking to me about my trans issues, while walking past the waiting room. 

I think you should switch the therapists. I dont know how old you are, so i dont know if you can do that on your own. Your therapist seems to not want to help you. If your parents have to decide the therapist, I would suggest talking to them. It doesn't have to be about why you're in therapy, i would say that i would feel uncomfortable with that therapist, amd that i would have a bad gut feeling about them. Then i would ask if i could get a probational (if it is called like that) sitting, to see if its different with another therapist. It's never bad to get a second doctors opinion. 

Stay safe, i hope the next therapist isn't as shitty as your current one! Good luck!
Definitely not normal and massive sign of disrespect therapy can only work if you and the furthest trust and respect each other
Nope. Drop that therapist and report her to the medical board. Refuse to go to any other sessions until you have a new one. They don't need to know why you want a new one. If they physically force you to attend, stonewall her and say nothing. They can make attendance mandatory but they have no control over participation.
Plain obvious transphobia. She's toxic. Ditch her.
I don’t find any of these comments to be worded strongly enough. 

This woman is TOXIC to your gender identity and self. She is creating more harm and showing herself to lack knowledge of basic care for individuals who are transgender. She is dangerous to you. You are 14 and exploring yourself (all 14 year olds are) you need safe adults who support that exploration. Therapist should guide that with research based approaches. Chosen names/ pronouns and being able to participate in hobbies and activities that align with their gender identity. It improves long term outcomes with existential gender dysphoria. 

If your parents don’t know and that is part of the problem so you/we need to game out a plausible reason to move therapists. Others have given you some language but happy to help in any way
As soon as you can, do get a new therapist. Even one who isn't specialised in helping trans people should at least have respect enough for you to address you the way you want. I do hope your mother will let you pick a different one.
Definitely not normal, also a violation regarding standard of care. Eject eject eject
ahh another classic case of SHIT THERAPIST
Of course its not? Thats abusive discriminative behaviour. The last person who should be doing that is a therapist.
If you've asked them not to deadname you and they keep doing it, then your mental health is not their priority and you should find a new therapist.
Not normal at all! You need a new therapist.
i dont think this is normal, im non-binairy and my therapist always makes sure he uses my preferd pronounce and never deadnames me even tho im still a minor
It's not normal or okay that your therapist is doing that.
As for legality, it depends on your country. You could likely get them in a decent amount of trouble in canada or the more progressive euro countries. If you're in America, you're SoL more than likely.
just from the title: NOPE
No, not at all. Just no. Horrible therapist, leave them.
No, that is not normal. Though I understand that your therapist could be trying to communicate that you are at an age where everyone (trust me, everyone) is figuring out who they are, she could make that point without disregarding your wish to be treated in a certain manner. Have you tried asking her straight up why she keeps calling you that way and told her that it makes you feel unvalidated/hurt?

Either way as a professional social worker I would suggest any of my clients to look for a therapist they can have a fit with. Any patient needs to feel safe with their therapist in order for it to have a good effect. If you don't feel safe, that straight up defeats the purpose of you being there. Hope things will work out better for you in the future.
So what I do in these sorts of situations is you go here on Reddit and find some good therapist horror stories. Doctor it up a bit, nothing too crazy to cause a confrontation, and get urself a new therapist. I mean just saying that your therapist is saying things like “get over it” should be enough for your parents to raise an eyebrow or two
I'm sorry this has happened to you this shouldn't be tolerated at all :(

Are you in the UK? If so and you're on an NHS service you should report her to your local PALS service for not respecting your gender identity
Find a different therapist.
This definitely is not normal
No this sounds like your therapist is being paid to change your mind or is practicing conversion therapy
Tell your parents she isn’t helping you and that it’s a waste of time and money (even though therapy is not, this therapist IS)! Bring up how not clicking with a therapist is normal! Hell OP, I’m willing to bet a good chunk of us have gone through more than 5! But if they seriously don’t let you change therapists, I’d just not participate in anything the therapist does or asks. This is not the purpose of therapy. Therapy is to help you, not make you more distressed.
I’ve been with my therapist for three years now, and she’s always been wonderful about using my pronouns and calling me my name. The only time she has ever called me my legal name is when we first met. I corrected her once and I never heard it again from her. Your therapist seems to be actively disrespecting your identity intentionally and I would definitely suggest trying to get out of that — though I understand you’ve tried and you’re in a tricky situation.
The first thing my therapist asked was my pronouns and she's never used anything but. It took me a while to find the right therapist but it's definitely worth it. You really have to be careful. I had a conservative therapist and didn't know for 3 months. I felt violated
Call them out every time they dead name and missgender you, they'll either get it and stop or keep going. If they keep going then get a new therapist
that isnt normal at all. shes definitely not taking you seriously 

my therapist only misgendered me once by accident and she wouldnt stop apologizing
my therapist asks me my name before each session (i haven’t picked one yet). def not a normal thing.
fucking report her. Im not even certain shes ALLOWED to do this. This seems like it could be classified as deliberate malpractice
No... This isn't normal. This therapist is transphobic and you can probably report her. Talk to her and tell her that it's unacceptable that she is constantly misgendering you and invalidating your identity. If she doesn't stop, report her, she's not creating a safe space for you. My therapist calls me M because I ask her to and she's giving me a letter of consent to start T. Your therapist is not normal and definitely evil.
No! Absolutely not. I’m a queer and trans therapist and there are some shitty, transphobic therapists in the field and I’m so so sorry!!! Therapists aren’t really governed by laws but it is in our ethical codes of practice to be social justice informed and not so stuff like this. You deserve better and so so sorry. 

Depending on what state you live in in the US (not sure about other countries) you can consent to therapy on your own without your parents knowing).
Just throw the whole therapist away 🗑️🚮
I don’t really understand why anyone would think this was normal
Your therapist is absolutely not supposed to misgender you.

I’ve had two different therapists, one state assigned therapist and one private therapist. The private one kept misgendering me, and the state assigned one put my chosen name in my patient journal.
Report her to her superiors, she’s doing it on purpose. If she’s legally a therapist, then she has been educated enough to know the crap she’s spewing goes against legitimate information about trans issues. If your mother refuses to get you an appropriate therapist & forces you to continue with her, perhaps u should ask her, if she would want to go back to a doctor because of a broken leg that tells you to walk it off because it will heal faster that way. It’s ridiculous, are they in cohoots?
New therapist now.
No.
Get out of there. Absolutely not ok and there is nothing in laws saying they have to misgender you. I told my therapist that I'm non binary, prefer they/them and my preferred name and she has called me that now every interaction EXCEPT when talking to my family because I've told her I am not out to them and don't want to be right now. That's what they are supposed to do, the are meant to support you, make you feel safe and comfortable and keep things confidential. This person has already failed to do those things. 

I hope you can get out of there without needing to be outed, good luck to you ❤❤
No, that is very unprofessional.
She is the one person who is supposed to get it. Ask her about it directly and see if she responds with gaslighting.
No this is a terrible therapist you should stop going immediately
Yeah mine did at first by accident, But he apologized in advance when I came out if he makes any mistakes.
no, I have had one experience with a therapist and they used the correct name and pronouns
No way should this be tolerated.
When I was a kid, the therapist my mother sent me to reported everything I told him back to her. She deliberately chose a therapist that would serve her interests, and guide me in a way she wanted.
Yeah, she has no respect. Like I’m cis and have a long name that can be shortened to lots of different nicknames. Everyone asks “what do you prefer?” When they meet me and usually stick for that variation. It’s not hard to extend this courtesy to trans people.
First off that therapist is extremely toxic, second if it was me in that situation and I wasn't able to get a new therapist and I was required to go to that one every time they misgendered me I would cut them off I would shout over them and I'd make sure they hear me when I say no this is my name or these are my pronouns.

 If they get upset because I'm talking over them and interrupting them which to them is rude and disrespectful.

 remind them that they are being rude and disrespectful to you and unless they change how they behave how can she expect you to change in this situation if anyone here is an adult shouldn't it be the therapist who's supposed to be helping and not being a toxic cunt. 

If that bitch said oh our interests change.. I'd be like I guess therapy was kind of one of your interests that kind of just changes from time to time I think it's time for you to quit because you suck with your listening skills.

PS this is just how I would do things I don't mind starting a fire and watching them burn in rage, I would absolutely instigate the situation and make them out to be some sort of village idiot.
 
TDLR; either change your therapist or don't go cuz she's very toxic. If that's not a choice just sit there in silence and ignore her. And if anyone asks just tell them she's not worth the time to talk to since she doesn't listen, which is a very disgusting trait for someone who pretends to be a therapist, she's clearly not qualified.
I gave up on therapy because of this(There is no better options where I live). Sorry you had to go through that.
No, as a therapist myself that should never happen. As someone who’s been in therapy and had someone consistently misgender me, it kept me from becoming who I was meant to be so I left them and reported them because that goes against their ethics code
Get as far away from that idiot as you can.  I had a doctor once asked me what my dead name was, and I quickly asked her if she enjoyed giving a blowjob directly after receiving anal? As you can imagine it shut her the hell up quickly, total deer in the headlights. But once I knew I had her exactly where I wanted her, I delivered my teaching moment and informed her that it's unacceptable to ask any transperson that question because it's unnecessary information and she and or her colleagues must refrain from ever asking it because their response might not be as restraint as mine was, if you could ever call it that...💋🧡
Nope, not normal. She doesn’t take you seriously and she cannot show some basic respect for your identity. I would say try to get a new therapist; maybe tell your parents things weren’t clicking with her and she didn’t ever make you feel better.
Your mum isn’t influencing the direction of the therapies?
It is WILDLY inappropriate for her to be so disrespectful!

***Get another one ASAP!***
Tell her look I'm not talking to a bigot, I am not accepting your detransition agenda then do not speak with her any longer, do not engage with her at all in session make her have to tolerate you try to make her have to decline you service
This is not a therapist. It sounds more like conversion therapy. If you’re not out to your parents (though they may know anyway. Parents often have a sixth sense about what’s going on with their kids) then you need to come up with a credible reason for why you need to switch therapists. It should be as easy as “it’s not a good fit”. Most people try a few different therapists until they find the right one. It’s important that it’s a good match since you need to be comfortable discussing really personal things and you won’t be able to do so if you don’t trust the therapist fully.
No, it's totally not okay. You can tell to your therapist if they do or say something that makes you feel uncomfortable. They're there to help and not to hurt or trigger you.
Yeah, get a new therapist. If she isn't taking the effort to make you comfortable and work with you then she's a waste of your time and money.
Any good therapists will respect your name and pronouns
This is absolutely abnormal, inappropriate, and inconsistent with guidelines adopted by the American Psychological Association.I hope you're able to find a new therapist and soon, ideally one recommended by trans people. Here is a (from 2015) link to the APA guidelines: https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2015/08/working-transgender
Get a new therapist
No, it’s not. Stop seeing that therapist now.
No no no it is not
No it’s not normal or appropriate
I don’t understand why your mom wants you to give it more time. Therapists aren’t cheap, even with insurance. Why does she want to waste money on someone who isn’t doing their job? I hope she changes her mind and helps you find someone more qualified and compassionate. I would be livid if I found out my son’s therapist was doing this to him.
Here where I live there are no laws about it. My therapist, which I only meet in order to be diagnosed with dysphoria to start hrt, always calls me with my chosen name and only uses my deadname for papers, as my legal name is my deadname. She is with an lgbt association btw, but a good therapist shall respect your identity and the deadnaming isn't a good sign. Unluckily it's very very very common I believe :c
This is the new conversion therapy. She's not on your side she's on your parents side. The dead naming and misgendering are intentional and even if they say otherwise they will never help you with your transition
Is it normal for purple koolaid to be stored in ranch bottles? (The answer is the same.)

I hope you find a better therapist.
im trans and 14 too, and am not out to my family either, and have quite a similar experience 

they should be able to use your correct name and pronouns, and that is what mine did

if that therapist is still like that, which im sure they might be, id recommend tic+. they use your preferred name and ask about you being out to your family or not whilst continuously checking for pronouns and name changes just in case they used your incorrect names or pronouns.

i hope this helps :)
Time to find a new therapist!  Don't even try to have that conversation, tell them that it's not working and you won't be seeing them anymore.
From a supportive therapist? Absolutely not, gtfo of there
No she shouldn’t do this. It is their job to help you and make you feel safe. You should tell your parents you dont feel like you can actually talk to her. Like its not safe space. I came out to my therapist around your age and he was incredibly understanding and only ever misgendered me when my parents where around but still went that extra mile to just use my name( im fine with my birth name) or gender neutral terms. My next therapist was the same. This is not normal at all
Absolutely not. Since you’re so young, it may be hard to find a therapist that will call you what you wish to be called, but also won’t tell your parents everything. My old therapist when I was first coming out (14 yo. I’m 23 now) told my parents everything and it caused a lot of problems at home. I’d flat out tell your mom “I’m not going until you find me another therapist because this one is making me worse”. It took me a while to find one but my current therapist is wonderful, immediately started calling me my new name and pronouns and even put it into my chart that I’m trans so that there won’t be any mix ups between other physicians

It’ll get better babe. Hang in there bro 🥰 Like the great Jinkx Monsoon said: “Water off a duck’s back”
That isn't normal at all. My therapist calls me by my preferred name and pronouns and goes out of her way to apologize if she slips up. I'd definitely get a new therapist if possible. You should be able to feel comfortable with a therapist and to be yourself.
That is actually illegal, i know this cause i went to therapy with my friend cause she hates her counselor and didn't fell comfortable being there alone and asked me to join. Her therapist still called me Leo, and said even though im not a client, she still cannot tell my parents and its illegal to deadname and make people feel bad about themselves during therapy. Even if it is during another session.
Not normal at all.

My therapist actually asks me _every time_ if I want her to use different pronouns or name for me. I haven't switched those yet.

But no, if anything they should be always ensuring they're using the right name/pronouns.
No, no it is not.
nope this is absolutely not normal, and it’s definitely not “required”. both of my good therapists have respected my name and pronouns, and have even let me talk about dysphoria and other non-binary specific things i’ve dealt with. not once have they called it a phase or anything like that. 

i had a therapist who told me there were only two genders completely unprompted. this was right when i was figuring myself out, and i knew i couldn’t talk about it with her. and i couldn’t tell my dad why i wanted a new one, so i just said i felt like i wasn’t making progress and her methods weren’t working with me. so i got a new one. and you DEFINITELY need a new one mate
Somebody who should be helping you get over gender dysphoria, or at least make it better shouldn’t INTENTIONALLY be deadnaming, misgendering, and actively making you feel like shot about yourself. To be honest, I would report your therapist, and get a new one. DEF a transphobe
My therapist wasn’t very well-versed on trans stuff, but when I came out as genderqueer and told her about my new name/pronouns, she did her research, stepped up, and she uses my name/pronouns and respects my identity and all my messy queerness as-is
my therapists i used to have used my new name and pronouns without issue and without telling my parents so its definitely not okay
that is absolutely NOT normal. get a new one asap that will respect you. when i first came out before i did any legal changes i was called by my proper name and pronouns. there isn’t a law that says they have to deadname and misgender you
It’s not normal at all. Deadnaming and invalidating a patient who is trans goes against every standard of care.

Edit: if you want to convey the message, ask this therapist for a referral to another therapist who is trained/specialized in caring for trans patients. That might also reassure your parents since you wouldn’t just quit this one.
Not at all they should be the first ones to use the correct names and gender.
Don’t have to read details. That’s not normal or ethical. Find a new therapy situation.
I’m gonna go with no.
Nope, drop her.
This ""therapist"" is clearly trying to do ""conversion therapy,"" in other words, they are trying to ""detrans"" you.

Same shit has been going on for decades, used to be they sent gay kids to therapy to ""straighten them out.""

The therapist is NO GOOD,.

It's very common for even NICE, well-meaning therapists to just not be a good match for many reasons, it can take several tries to find one you click with. Tell your parent that you just aren't clicking with this one and want to try another... you can do that without outing yourself. Just say something like ""She means well, but she doesn't 'get' me"" or whatever. 

Find a way to let your mom know that it can take a few tries to find someone you feel comfortable with. Maybe be more harsh than the gentle way I said above, maybe tell your parent ""She makes me very uncomfortable and I don't have a feeling of trust I need to talk openly.""
I'm so sorry this is happening to you. absolutely not.
Not normal

Find a new therapist
Hey! First of all, it is so brave and big of you to put your story out on the internet at such a young age! I hope that the amount of responses you’re getting isn’t too overwhelming and that you are able to process this difficult situation to the best of your abilities.

The thing is, from experience, if you’re not feeling your therapist, there is no legal commitment to them, even if you’re a minor. You are paying to a service most likely tied to a specific company. If you don’t feel comfortable talking it through with your parents, try talking it through directly with your therapist.

Therapy is supposed to benefit you. You are literally paying for someone to help you process your emotions, it’s best to find a good match. Don’t be afraid to be direct and list your needs. This can look like this:

“I want to talk about some boundaries with you that are very important important to me. Moving forward in my journey of self acceptance and trying to understand and explore my gender identity, I find it of utmost importance for those I come out to to use he/him pronouns. I have noticed that despite having brought this up before, you still have not found a way to appropriately acknowledge my preferred gender identity. This sense of assurance and acknowledgment is very important to me moving forward in my transition, so I was wondering if you could recommend me to someone in your team that has experience with trans affirming care.”

Now, not all therapists are professionals that get how the system works. Especially when working with minors, they can easily manipulate you into staying with them. So, if you give this whole shpeel and you still get set back by your therapist, call the medical provider directly to request a change. Like I said, you are not committed to any specific person. You Pat for a service that is charged per session, and you have a right to find the person who makes that session feel worthy or your time (money).

I understand that you are a minor and that there might be some fear in changing any counseling arrangement that your parents have set up for you. Obviously this quoted speech I have provided can seem wordy or just not in your voice, but I hope that putting the words out there might help you formulate the plan you know will work for you. 

As a 23 year trans fem, I just hope that this message helps in any way. When I was your age I wasn’t even close to understanding half the things you understand now and seeing that you are curious and willing to fight the fight at your age is so inspiring. Keep it up sib 🫶🏼🏳️‍⚧️
If the therapist was chosen by your parents. The therapist might have been told to push you towards not transitioning by your family. Hence the use of the wrong pronouns and name.
Find a new therapist I’m sorry they’ve been doing that
wtf lol, evil therapy
Not normal at all. Idk if it’s illegal, but I’d bet it’s something she could probs lose her license over. I’d tell your parents the truth on why you don’t want to see her anymore; your therapist has had you open up and talk to her about your feelings and issues in your day to day life which she has then invalidated and minimized. She doesn’t listen and she frequently tells you that your feelings on the matters will change therefore your issues and feelings should not be considered or viewed as important by you or her. You don’t feel safe or comfortable with her and need a therapist who will listen to you and equip you with the tools you need to navigate the world and the issues that go with it which she is not doing and isn’t willing to do.
I'm so sorry dear. That sounds awful.  ❤
Have you checked to see if this is a legit therapist? Is she licensed? If so where? How much experience do they have with youth? Just questions to ask her in response to her rudeness.
Fire that therapist. File a complaint too. It should be on her record that she actively harmed a patient.
It's not. When I first came out to my therapist she started evaluating me for gender dysphoria on the spot. The diagnosis was crystal clear, and it was my therapist who referred me to a gender health specialist to start GAHT.
It depends where you live in the U.S couse in red states it's legal but I believe in some blue stats they aren't aloud to misgender you
No this is definitely not normal.

Edit: oops sorry replied to the wrong place

Yea I think this is something the therapist in question could lose their license over if reported. It definitely violates the APA’s standards of care
You’re right, it sounds like that therapist is actively trying to talk them out of being transgender
One of the biggest things she has told me is this. And to be honest I don’t have a problem and I understand. I’m not ready for surgery or anything else like that, it’s illegal where I live anyway so even if I did I’m kinda stuck. But it feels like she’s trying to like..convert me to “not being trans”..?  Like she keeps telling me stuff “One day you’ll probably realize you’re not trans” and stuff. I don’t know if that makes sense
so true
Your own feelings show you in what direction the needle of your hearts compass is pointing you. All the other things people say are just information you are free to take or leave in order to map out the road to your destination. 

If you are trans no one can convert you to not being trans.

Ultimately, when you grow a little more independent from others, you will see that the people that matter don't mind what you identify as and the people that mind don't matter."	11hqnjy	trans	355	0.96	2023-03-04 05:28:07
My mom told me she accepted me but...	"Okay so to start from the beginning, my coming out to my mom was kinda chaotic. We had a big argument where she talked about things she reproached me that didn't have any link with me being trans and she basically told me she refused (she used that exact term) to use my name and pronouns. I didn't talked to her for a few weeks.

I felt bad for that because after all she was my mom, so i went back to talk to her. It was much more calm, she told me she just needed some time to get used to my name and pronouns (which i understand).

But then she said she didn't want to ""force herself"" to use them, she wanted to wait until it becomes natural. I didn't say anything because i'm unable to contradict her because im afraid of conflict.

Now it's been more than a year. At first her and my stepdad made some efforts to gender me correctly. It must have lasted a month or two. I moved on my own and we talked less. Two weeks ago they came to visit me. They didn't use my name, they kept misgendering me. I don't know how to feel about this.

Edit: Wow, thanks for the support ! I sent a message to my mom. I tried not to be agressive. I'll tell y'all how it goes."	"You should tell her it's never going to ""become natural"" if you don't try to use someone's correct name and pronouns. You have to force yourself at first, in order for it to become natural to call them by that name.
Your mom should ask herself if she cares more about her own child or if she cares more about society norms... Her ""mother pride"" may give her more strength to accept how things are now.

Whish you best luck!
You only learn it if you force yourself to do something. Almost nothing comes naturally I'd say.
It's not coming natually to your parents because they're still calling you by your deadname when you're not around. It's very difficult to pick up a new name and pronouns when they're only using them an hour a month when they see you.
Open communication is always a good thing. I have a little formula to address, in a non confrontational way, issues or concerns.
1. You state what bothers you as something you've noticed.
2. Think from there perspective and ask 3 legit reasons for why they may have acted or done the action. 
3. Leave with an open eneded question
4. Shut up and really listen. Do not contruct your response while they're talking. If needed before replying let them know you wanted a moment to think about what they say.

For this how you could phrase it.
You go up to them and say ""hey I've noticed you and dad weren't using my pronouns and are misgendering me. Is that because...
(You know your parents think of three reasons why they would be doing thar. Uncomfortable with it, still adjusting and something else. ) and then ask what's going on? Or what's up? Depending on how you talk to them. Give them a chance to let you see their perspective. Then ask if you can share how it's made you feel because you want good communication. With the reasons be careful not to be passive aggressive with it. Good luck. I hope you find peace and happiness.
When my sister started calling me my new name it didn't sound very natural but it became natural after she started using it for a while. It won't be natural until they start using the name. They very likely don't except you and are stalling so that you can't get mad at them.
It'll never become natural if she doesn't actively try to use them.

I'm so sorry you have to go through this, that's really shitty of her :c
...sorry...
I'm going through the same thing. I've been out to my mom, dad, and step dad for almost two years now and they still refuse to use my preferred name and pronouns even after I keep correcting them. My mom straight up told me she thinks it's a phase.
genuinely you should just talk to them about it again- i understand that you’re scared of conflict, bc me too- but the only way to get any progress is to stand your ground. explain to them how it makes you feel, and remind them that it’s a matter of respect. it isn’t political, or religious… it’s just about making you feel valued and loved. 
best of luck to you friend!
Yea, I'm afraid that will happen to me too.
My family is very Cristian and lo behold I'm trans.

That really stinks tho.
Op, this sounds like your mom is making excuses to not accept you, to hide her own insecurities and short comings. In all honesty, tell her to use your pronouns or get used to not seeing or talking to you. You've gotta take care of yourself, and If they aren't going to make the efforts to use your pronouns, then they don't deserve your time
My mom was the excat way, she even yelled at me for wearing a bra, but then she started trying. She referred to me with the right pronouns and my new name. She even yelled at my sister for only using They/Them when I use She/Her. Your parents can too. Let them know how you feel and be stern. I promise it'll be fine.
I’m not the kind of person who is calm and careful when it comes to conflicts like these so I would tell my parents that I don’t want them to come visit or contact me anymore until I felt comfortable again because their behavior (not using my name and pronouns) makes me feel uncomfortable and unsafe. 

The more careful way would be talking to them or writing them a letter (if you really want to avoid direct conflict) why using a different name and pronouns can only feel natural if the start to use it and how you feel when they don’t even try. And that YOUR feelings matter too. 

My gf had a similar experience with her parents. Her mother even said the exact same thing (I won’t use your name and pronouns, because you’re still (deadname) and a he) and after that my gf moved out and broke off relations with her parents. A few months later she contacted them again (just like “hi, how are you?”) and suddenly it worked. No words about her being “a he”, no more deadnaming. 
Sometimes parents need to notice how shitty they behave and that they can’t just treat “their” child how they want to without consequences…when they notice that their behavior has consequences they will sometimes suddenly treat you like another human being instead of their property.
Dig in your heels. Own your identity. Eminate light. Eventually they will come around and if they don't, your wellbeing is more important. 

Its taken 5 years to get to the point where my parents gender me correctly  50% of the time and the other 50% they correct themselves and apologise. During that time, things were really hard and we didn't speak much at all and when we did things got very rense and I was always crying and having a go at them for misgendering me. They realised after a few years that this wasn't going away and they could see how happy I was as my real self. 

As I've gotten older I have recognised that transitioning, although obviously way more difficult for me, was challenging for them as somewhat Conservative children of the 60s and I have forgiven them for not taking it very well because I can see that over time they have made an effort. 

I know its hard, but stay strong and patient. If they are worth your time they will come around. One of the most important thing i learned from my therapy over this time has been that I don't need their approval or love to be happy and myself. That is a bonus nice to have, but I have everything I need to be OK in myself. When I let go of my need for their approval and love things got a lot better in our relationship because I was entering our interactions with a lot less tenseness and anxiety. 

I hope things get better for you love ♥️
[removed]
That's exactly what i'm thinking. I'm just afraid to tell her because i don't know if she's just not doing efforts or if she doesn't accept me
Eating with your hands as a baby will always feel natural unless you try using silverware.
Thank you. I will do this
Don't be. It's not your fault
Sorry to hear that. I feel you❤️
Wow, you sound a lot like a high school bully. “Don’t worry about loving yourself because the approval of others is what really matters!” FOH with your bs.
It sounds like she doesn't accept you tbh. What I'd bet she means by ""when it becomes natural"" is ""when you pass""

Tell her to get stuffed imo. Family is made of people who love you for you and are willing to respect you.
She's making excuses to hide the fact she doesn't accept you. Sure, it takes time for parents to get used to your new name and pronouns, but if they're actually making an effort, it definitely doesn't take that long. 

What the process actually looks like if they're accepting is trying their best to use your new name and pronouns. They'll probably have slip ups for a while, but those become less frequent until there's no slip ups at all.

For reference, my parents have been aware of my preferred name and pronouns for a little over a year and a half now, and it has been months since they last used my old pronouns.
Refusing outright is not good.  Its the red flag that someone isn't accepting you and is far more concerned about themselves than you.  I'm ALWAYS pro-trying to work with family that try, but maybe have trouble.  

But when refusing, its really tough.  Its much better for your health to do what you've done and distance yourself from them.  Giving them the chance to accept and turn around.  But it does become 100% up to them to decide that you're worth more than their bullsh#t.  

My dad is like this and I communicate with him but I don't really see him.  And it sucks but I don't know how you improve the situation. 

Huge hugs hun, I feel your pain.  But you being yourself is more important at the end of the day.  Don't let anyone hold you back! <3
yeah it’s not going to come natural when she’s known you by a different name and gender for so long. it’s on her to practice and push through it feeling awkward
This
Can I act like its my fault?

Happy cake day
No. I doubt it's as drastic as when you pass. That's way over the top when when really just sounds like a boomer who is afraid of change. Just the same, change has to be pushed. She has choices here.

It's never going to truly be OP's choice. It will be her mother's period, but my mom was...wow at first. She calls my wife her daughter now. Like, not even daughter in law, but daughter. First time was so validating foe her. ❤️ But one choice OP does get to and have to make is making it stronger and clear this isn't just going to go away to her mom. It'll never get better if she doesn't, but if she does, It'll be her mom's fault if it doesn't get any better.
I agree our son came out as trans at the beginning of this year...we asked him his preferred pronouns and then he came up with a new name . the first couple of weeks we did slip up and all him his then legal name but we made the effort to call him by his preferred name(which is now his  legal name)  and pronouns......

&#x200B;

now saying his name has come naturally  to us
Why ?
And you belong in detention for your childish behavior. Trans people are perfectly capable of functioning in society, having a job, and living a normal life. Meanwhile you slither your way into this thread and spew your vile “opinions.” You don’t belong in an asylum, but you are definitely not well-adjusted
Youre just jealous because we have hobbies, life and a brain huh
fuck off, i dont remember anyone wanting your opinion, if your too jealous that these wonderful people are getting respect and you aren't, theres lots of lovely trash cans outside, you don't need to be here
Omg, I made this account last year when my egg finally cracked. So thank you, and happy one year of knowing who I am to meee 🥰
Well look that that - a parent that has chosen to use a name in 4 months. wow -- look it CAN be done. 

Really though, I'm being a smartass but people show up here all the time asking how they can possibly be expected to learn a new name in lEsS thaN FiVe YeaRs?!

I observed transphobia and misgendering of a restaurant employee. Should I complain?	"UPDATE: Got a message yesterday that the corporation immediately went to the franchise owner and action was being taken. I went back to the same place this morning. The employee was there and very chipper, took my order and gave me great service along the way. I'm glad I said something. Thanks again all!

Edit: Complaint filed. Thanks for the feedback!

TL;DR: Saw a fast food employee being misgendered hostily and visibly upset over it. Should I complain to the corporation or am I possibly escallating a problem that it is thier perogative to choose to fight(forcing an issue they may choose to ignore)?

I went to a fast food restaurant to grab breakfast this morning where I observed an employee who was calm but upset. I heard them say something about ""this is not harassment, its the opposite of harassment"" and then they said ""I don't use she"". (I say they/them, idk what their preferred pronouns are but I know it isn't she) They then were trying to take my order while a woman in the back was loudly complaining about ""not need this [something something] in the morning"". They then said out loud ""Wow, nice, transphobia and misgendering from my manager"" or something to that effect and again said ""I don't use she"" as they walked back to grab my food. They were calm but I could hear the slight waiver in their voice and I knew it was probably taking a lot to keep it together in that moment. It broke my heart to watch.

I'm inclined to complain to the corporation about what I saw. (The local manager is the perpetrator so I don't think complaining to her would do anything.) But before I do, Im not trans and I wanted some feedback. Would you want someone to complain on your behalf? Or would you not want someone else to make the choice to make this a fight for you?  I know what happened is wrong, but I also know we pick and choose our battles and I'm afraid to make that choice for them especially at thier place of employment.

Thanks for the advice. Looking to do the right thing here."	"Yes, complain.
Power struggles in the workplace can be absolutely awful for everyone involved. You should absolutely tell corporate, especially since you can do so anonymously.
Speaking only for myself, I’d want someone to speak up for me. I think filing a complaint is the right thing to do here.
You should absolutely complain. The only reason not to is a fear of reprisals, but the employee is already getting those, so you complaining can’t escalate that. And corporate can’t reprisal, because that’s discrimination. You might not fix anything, but if the employee catches wind, they’ll know someone out there cares, and sometimes that’s what it takes to keep going.
It sounds like it worsened YOUR experience so there is nothing wrong with making a complaint. You don’t have to be the target of bigotry to speak against it. And it probably won’t result in much, but your report could be the difference between that worker’s complaint being taken seriously as a part of a pattern versus not.
Yes, you should complain. It's screwed up, but when a cis person complains about a trans person's problems, the problems have a much better chance of being addressed.
You gotta complain. 

Corporations don't care about morality - they care about money. They'll only change things if they believe this affects paying customers being comfortable spending money at their stores.
file the complaint please, speaking up for yourself is hard they could use the help!
Raising the issue to corporate can be effective. But be vague. Don't say it was directed at a particular employee, but that you heard mgmt being transphobic in view of customers and made you feel uncomfortable. I'm trans and have lost a couple jobs because of well meaning people advocating on my behalf, but corporate would rather get rid of everyone involved to protect the money. Caveat to this is union jobs. They protect the workers enough to be safe to not be vague.
I don't know, but I'd like to hear from folks on this too.
Complain! Outside help could be the push they need to escape harassment
I would think that the quote, “The only thing necessary for the triumph of evil is for good men to do nothing” applies here. Caveat, clearly it’s for good people, not just men, but that is quote itself talking. 

It’s your choice but when you feel like making a stand, make a stand!
Record them, send it to corporate anonymously if needed and cc a few local news agencies. Make the system work for you.
Obviously it is not okay for the employer to harass employees in the workplace — but also you having to *witness* workplace harassment is not okay. 

I would definitely report what you saw and frame it as upsetting to *you* — you are not complaining on behalf of the employee (that would actually be kinda paternalistic)….you are complaining about a customer service issue (hostile environment) that could not be resolved by “asking to speak to the manager” on site, because it involved the manager herself. 

Making it about *your* interaction with *the company* helps to eliminate any “she said/they said” from the manager and the employee in question. At the end of the day, YOU weren’t comfortable with the behavior of *the manager* and you are leaving the employee out of it (except for describing the polite and calm behavior of the employee, to emphasize that the manager is the one who is out of line).
I'm conflicted, but as a person who's not terribly confrontational, less so than the person in the story, it would mean alot to me personally if someone told corporate on my behalf.
Shoulda just bunny hopped over the counter and hugged them
Yes complain if upper management doesn’t know the problem doesn’t go away it will keep happening and get worst it must be addressed to upper management for the to have proper training in this situation
Yes, please complain to corporate. And thank you for being a good ally 💜🙏🌈✨
Absolutely put in a complaint, not only are you simply in your right to do so, but it may (hopefully) even help that employee
I would say confront the manager if you have the confidence, ideally away from other people to avoid further embarrassment for the individual in question and file a further complaint to head office.
Please do, and thank you. You'd be making some future trans person's day much better.
Too bloody right to complain,  you go there for some food not to be abused by there staff, that should be instant dismissal x
A better thing to do would be to contact the manager or franchise owner and complement that employee. Explain that you really appreciate that this is a company that hires diverse employees and you saw a couple customers being incredibly rude to this employee and you were just really impressed with how they kept their cool to still provide good customer service and they were just a really friendly person and you’ll definitely be coming back because you appreciate that they hire good staff. There might be instructions on your receipt on how to review your visit or a form online to complement outstanding service.
That sucks! I know my work wouldnt tolerate that shit! I kinda wanna outmyself sometimes just to test the customers haha, they wanna try some shit we will tell them to never come back hahahaha
Whether the employee wants to ""push the issue"" or not, it's NOT acceptable for a team lead or manager to speak down to or disrespect their employees in any way. As a customer, I'd put in a complaint out of disgust for the lack of professionalism shown from the manager. Whether it's about misgendering or not, it shouldn't be acceptable to speak that way to someone ever.
Yes. Absolutely.
Complain. There may be repercussions for the employee(hopefully not), but it's important to stand up against this sort of thing.
Do it. Even if the managers don’t give a shit, they’ll certainly stop doing this once they have to go to HR and sit through some godawful harassment movie from the 80s and then get written up.
seconded
This is a good point. Make it clear that as a customer YOU care about people’s gender being respected. YOU don’t want to do business with a company that has managers that mistreat people. It’s not just about the employee’s welfare (although it is definitely about that too).

They might care about it a bit more if it is framed as a customer complaint rather than an employee complaint, unfortunately.
I'm sorry I have to disagree with ya. I  try to be kind to all folks who work retail / food industry jobs as those jobs  are a special heck.Though  that kind of management is not good for the employees, the owner, or the business at large.    


I personally have only made a corporate complaint once and it was for nothing near this level of crap.
thirded
The problem is whether or not the person you’re contacting is affirming of trans people. If this was chik fil a, contacting corporate with a complaint isn’t going to do anything good. If this is a franchised restaurant, corporate isn’t going to care. If the franchise owner or a manager is contacted with a complaint and they’re not affirming, they may just decide that this employee is too much drama. If someone above the manager is contacted to complain specifically about the manager, maybe they’ll intervene, but more likely they’ll just send a useless apology to OP.

Chain businesses do look at survey metrics on their employees. They look at who’s consistently getting 5 stars, who’s getting complaints or less than five stars and who’s getting complementary reviews and they generally meet with their employees and come down on them for anything less than perfect reviews so giving someone a good review in a survey can help. That’s why places like post offices and grocery stores have an option to complete a survey and the employee generally tells you about it and circles it. Generally their manager is pressuring them to do this and will reprimand them if they don’t get enough reviews or don’t get all 5 stars.
[deleted]
Regardless of that even if corp doesn't do anything or actively is approving of the vitriol  towards them it's a paper trail for possible employee action later down the line especially if the corp does nothing. Kinda the same way with a complaint to hr if it's not addressed or gets worse.    


I mean heck I just wish we could know the person facing the whole thing so we could advise them to file a labor complain and one with the EEoC. They deserve better and this blatant abuse shouldn't be tolerated.

Even when we're dead we get purposefully misgendered		"The sheer lack of respect these people have for someone who is not only dead but was fucking murdered just for being true to herself is exactly why I will never have a shred of respect for any of them
A 16 year old girl was fucking murdered for being herself and people are just saying the most disrespectful things ever because she’s trans. If she was cis these people would be devastated but since she’s trans they don’t give her the basic respect she deserves? How fucking stupid do you have to be to look at a teenage girl who was murdered and argue against her gender identity. How detached from your own humanity do you have to be to look at a murder victim and go “oh but they were trans 🙄”.  I’m just so done with how people treat anyone who isn’t like them does it not register to them that a slight difference doesn’t make someone not human? I hope her friends and family know they aren’t alone in their grief. Rest in peace Brianna.
Guess her death certificate will be factually incorrect then.  🤷‍♀️🙄 Fuck this shitty world. 😾🤦‍♀️
wtf is wrong with people, filthy asf
Doesn’t look like a boy to me
Horrible. Just....I can't.today.
I'm a UK trans woman too, although I'm closeted, honestly wondering if I'm better off staying in the closet and trying to find peace in this male husk of a body I'm stuck with
Omg I'm sick now
I hate this stupid world
This is what drives people to violence, I am absolutely disgusted
this is infuriating
Rest well, Brianna. You'll be remembered as the person you were, regardless of the bigots.
They make me so angry
I hate it how people make the connection: “just because you wear a dress doesn’t make you a woman”. I don’t know about you, but that statement has killed MOST drive for me even wanting to wear one! Let people be who they are, and I hope she is honored for who she was, and will remain in honor.
I hope she haunts the fuck out of every single piece of shit that’s hurt her or are disrespecting her and make their lives a living hell
If you’re old enough and prepared enough yo take a life, you forgo the “child” designation. Throw their asses in with general population. Don’t care if they die. Actions have consequences. Especially pre-meditated acts committed with pure malice and hatred.
There is so many crappy people in this world. Just treat people with respect, especially when they have been brutally murdered.
Then those same people demand we show respect for their bigotry. It is dreadful.
Here’s one thing this proved to me. These are actual pathetic lunatics like fr. Their accs is nothing but hate comments, and the crazy part is these aren’t just online pigs many exist in the real world and could result like what happened to Brianna. Don’t hold back to hate anymore
This whole community feels for her, I live relatively near to where this happened and the police are saying its not a hate crime, hard to believe
The UK is obsessed with misinformation, it's so bad we're incorrectly gendering dead peoplw
I thought that too, she looks like a beautiful young woman
You're not, Scotland is the place for us
I agree but I don't see it happening, this country is a bit too protective of minors who commit murder. Mary Bell is a perfect example, so I doubt they even get life
Definitely hard to believe Stay safe.
Transphobia blinds people
Lucky for me I'm still closet, I have a subtly fem hair style and go to a salon nearby but I now feel like I can't come out for fear of this happening to me
It would seem so
I’m sorry I hope the world can become safer for us one day
Once Scotland gets independence us UK transbians will have a safe escape

I’m so sorry, but Girl, you are so pretty though! 👍🏻
I don't even understand how that could happen you're the most beautiful woman I've seen in a long time
Dame thought you were Kate beckinsale beautiful
Aside from your sheer beauty, I have deep sympathy for your parents' issues. .. Ultimately, you're all they have. I'm older, and my parents are long gone. I was never out to them, but I know they would have objected ... but ultimately, come around grudgingly because.. well, you only ever have the one set of parents.. if you're lucky. .. Maybe leaving the house to be on your own earlier... so you can find your community in another town or city.. And let them come around as you mature, and they age... I wish I could offer a better answer. Good luck.
Your parents really need to see an optometrist. You look bloody great!
I'm sorry sweetie you're loved by me and others
I had my birthday the other day, living fulltime as my prefered gender, and my family still slip up, even though their intentions are good.
Family is so ingrained in their behaviour regarding us, so as you already know it’s them not you. Makes me think they need an acid trip to the brain while someone repeats our pronouns over and over again, or they could just not be assholes, who knows :)
 you are beautiful, you are passing and your parents opinion doesn't matter
I’m so sorry mate. You’re beautiful and courageous. I’m still in the closet about it
It sucks that you are having to endure that with your family.  But if it’s any consolation, you look absolutely incredible 👍

my social worker misgenders me to my face	"It's super fun considering she has my preferred name on file, she has he/him pronouns in her file, and her colleagues refer to me as male. 

But no she just does not give a flying fuck"	"At this point I'd talk directly to her boss.

I lived at a youth institution, with a lot of social workers, and talking directly to their boss helped a bit. The boss was easy to get to though, since they worked in the same building.
The system was flawed, and it all went back to how it was after a week, but still, after multiple complaints things are bound to happen.

I've since moved out and have now a 1 on 1 social worker. If it happens that he won't respect me, I can ask for a new one. It'll take time though.

So if you have a type of 1 on 1 like me, you could probably ask for a new one.

Social workers should care about their patients, and she's doing a preeetty bad job at it. I'm really sorry you have to deal with this crap.
Do you know if your social worker has either her LSW, or MSW and belongs to NASW? (Assuming you’re in the U.S.) 

Even if she’s just a BSW, you can file a formal complaint because she is blatantly breaking one of the code of ethics of social work, and if you file a formal complaint, state that.
(Doing a Google search for:
‘Social work code of ethics’ should bring them up. Those are brought up every day when getting the education and are taken seriously by those who want to keep their jobs.
(Former foster kid and social worker here.)

I hope you say something. Adults in that field tend to be a**holes because they’re either Not working through their own crap, or truly don’t belong in the field. Even people under 18yo have rights, so speak up for yourself and stand up tall. You are worth it.
Wow. That is truly cruel.
As a social worker myself, this goes against quite a few professional standards. You should not have to put up with this and you would be well within your rights to talk to their supervisor/manager about getting a new worker. There are a lot of utterly hopeless social workers out there, but there are good ones and you have a right to quality care.
Talk to their boss. Find out if there's a client advisory council. The place i work at has one anyways. When you start services you're generally also given a client rights pamphlet and being treated respectfully will be on that.
Definitely file a complaint on every level that you can.
ALL my coworkers misgender my husband, but me. It infuriates me but for some reason as welcome as trans femmes are in Hawaii they just cannot wrap their heads around the idea of a trans masc. half of them think my husband is mtf and the other half just hit this wall of incomprehension and their eyes go glassy like their brain is trying to rewrite what their ears just heard but is failing and the result is nothing happened because that’s the only safe answer.
Call her by the wrong pronouns to **Her** face, when she objects tell her that turnabout is fair play.
Aww, I'm so sorry you have to deal with that! People can be cruel...
They seem to think we'll just snap out of it if we hear our presumed genders in our face everyday.  Man, if that worked it would have happened a long time ago.  I'm almost always misgendered and it doesn't stop me from being who I am.
Contact your local ombudsman. Sorry you have to go through that
I am the more forgiven type so if it happened once
I would let go
Maybe just tell that worker again,  if it happened again then you have all the right to be mad and talk with your boss
Again i'm the more forgiving type and i would think if it happened once it's just a mistake 
But you have all the right to be angry
Sounds less like the social worker doesn't care and more like they're going out of their way to be abusive
I'd absolutely be that bitch and report them to the NASW. Clear ethical violation
This.

I am a social worker and faced disciplinary action for advocating for a NB client. My union lawyer defended my actions based partially on the NASW Code of Ethics.
Yes. As a person with a healthcare license, you can always file a complaint with the licensing board in the place that they practice. The whole reason given for licensure is protection of the the public, well my dear, you’re the public.
So they really can't comprehend ""you know trans women he's the other way around""? I've heard of not understanding enbies but that's a whole other level. Wow.
Call him by the wronf pronouns to **His** face, when he objects, tell him that turnabout is fair play.
That too. Either way, the boss should be told about it
No, they really can’t. I’m just guessing here but I think it’s because Polynesian culture has always had a concept of a third gender but it’s one that applies to effeminate men. So they’ve got a box for me. They just… ran out of boxes.

I keep deadnaming and misgendering myself in my head. Is this common, especially early in transition?	"On the one hand this makes me feel pretty bad about myself, but I also try to justify it as ""I've lived and presented as one way for so long, of course I will 'slip up' on occasion."" I would assume this would be common, but I still have to ask so my stupid brain will feel better."	"Yes, it is absolutely common. Its the same idea as breaking a habit. Your brain just uses the labels without thinking about it and then afterwards you catch yourself.
I've been using she/her and Stephanie for around 7 months now and still regularly deadname and misgenders myself in my head. It's a long process.
I was having the same worries as you today after I clearly misgendered myself and this post made me realize that it is common to misgender yourself during transition, thanks
I'm over 5 years into my transition, and I can tell you that I deadnamed myself OUT LOUD a few times early into my transition. It's absolutely common, and I'm happy to say it will end. If you wanna talk about anything, you can message me!
I’m just a few weeks into my transition and I’m constantly misgendering myself in my own head. It’s a big adjustment.
Absolutely. It’s been months and it still happens occasionally. It’s just a result of your brain being so used to something for so long and having to change. Trust me when I say it gets easier. Best of luck! 😊
Thanks for asking this question! I'm glad I'm not the only one!
About 25 years ago I got a book with a hundred psychological experiments in it and one of the experiments was to disassociate and then reassociate your name. 
You could definitely do this in halves with your deadname and then your new name. 
The experiment was very simple you just said your name over and over and over again and after about 50 times you disassociate from your name and then you keep saying it and you reassociate with it. 
Obviously you can stop in the middle and start saying your new name.
I’ve been out for about 2.5 years and it used to happen a lot in the past, but I was surrounded by supportive people and it happened less and less until it basically never happened. Due to covid, I don’t see a lot of those supportive people anymore and I got a job that I’m not comfortable to be out at, so I’ve noticed I misgendered and deadname myself a lot more in my head. 

Basically, I feel like it’s a combination of your acceptance of yourself and other people validating you.
It's so common. It's still a struggle for me, but every day gets a little easier. May your heart be open to the giving and receiving of love.
Just as the people around you need time to adjust to a new name and pronouns, in my experience, you will too. It Took me ages to get it right and I still misgender myself sometimes. I’m going on hormones soon so perhaps that’s a testament to how common this actually is
Interesting thread, I didn't know this was a thing. I went by my new name and as female online for so long it became my default long before I ever transitioned. I had no idea this isnt how it goes for others.
I struggle with this too. I realized that I was trans 24 years ago but I spent the entire time hiding/ performing in boy mode and habits like that can really die hard. I feel really bad when I do it too, worse than when those in my circle accidentally slip up. When you rationalize it, it's honestly likely to happen at least once or twice.
Hell yes. Legitimately took me about 5 years into social transition to stop doing that, especially when speaking in the past tense
I was having the same worries as you today after I clearly misgendered myself and this post made me realize that it is common to misgender yourself during transition, thanks
Yes
Totally normal, doesn’t make you any less valid :)
Wait until you have your first dream as yourself it's euphoria!
I’m 6 years in and I still misgender/deadname myself mentally from time to time. It happens just correct yourself gently and try not to focus too much on it.
yes, i cracked and named myself 10 weeks ago, and still do that...
This happened to me quite frequently when I first chose my name about a year ago. I sometimes force myself to misgender myself or use my deadname when quoting somewhen for something they said a few years back, though
I'm not going to say it's uncommon because obviously not, but do you talk about yourself in the third person? I only ever gender myself as ""I/me""
God,,,,this is almost a universal experience for trans people! Don’t worry op!😭
ive known i was trans since i was 12/13, and i kept misgendering myself for years. part of it was living in an intensely transphobic environment. the other part was that i hadn’t found my name yet! when i found the name that was perfect for me, i found it was wayyy easier to gender myself correctly mentally. maybe that’s just me, but it might be something to look into?
Oh god I do that all the time, it’s the absolute worst
I’m telling people I’m giving them time to adjust to my new name and pronouns because I still keep using the wrong ones.
Yeah and yeaj
Yeah, I did that a bit
We’re definitely in the same shit !! It feels good to know I’m normal 😁(well not according to every body but who cares 😒)
So I'm not going crazy. Thank you!
I'm glad to know this is common.  I figured it was but, like I said in my post, I still had to ask for the sake of my sanity.
I am taken aback by the positivity this thread is getting from people with the same situation.  I was afraid I was asking something redundant or asinine, but I couldn't find a similar thread.
Interesting!  So, how do you set this up?  Just say ""My name is...?"" and repeat that over and over?
I can see that.  I'm not out at my job yet, partly because I want to get as much of my insurance and PTO out of that place as possible and partly because nearly everyone I work with is incredibly conservative and openly hateful.  At first I was just going to ditch the place when I was ready, but I really think I want to come out just to see what will happen.  There aren't any protections for trans people in our personnel policy, so I don't believe I would have any legal action I could take were I to be fired, but I also don't believe in frivolous lawsuits so I don't necessarily want to cause a stink just for the sake of proving a point.  I don't know...

Also, my parents aren't supportive.  Right now my dad is at the ""you are a confused man"" stage...
This is far more difficult for me to explain than I would care to admit, but I'll try.  I don't talk about myself in the third person, but I frequently think of myself in the third person.  Especially when I'm thinking about how conversations might go with someone.  It kind of plays out like a film script, if that makes sense.  And I'll think ""Ben likes sea salt chips,"" instead of ""Emily likes sea salt chips.""
Don't worry, I felt the same way when I first changed everything :)

A transguy venting	"So I'm a transguy, pre everything at a very very lgbt+ friendly school, which means there are a LOT of lgbt people, and nonbinary or trans people, and almost no cishet people at all. 
Because of the great number of people who are trans, people don't really notice that I am trans as well (not in the good way, I don't pass).
I find it very difficult to hang out with other boys, because they either misgenders me or see me as a girl.
With other trans/nonbinary people, they make such a big deal out of their transness or sexuality, which makes me very uncomfortable.
They keep saying stuff like ""There are only trans people in this room"" or ""there's only AFABs here, except for..."" and so on.
I've started to hate the term AFAB and AMAB because it starts to feel like another way to catagorize transpeople and nonbinary people as girls or boys. 
It feels weird when you've fought all your life to not be in the box labelled 'girl' and when you finally reach the box labelled 'boy' you get slammed into another box labelled 'AFAB'.
I just want to be treated as a guy, not a transguy.
It's the same with sexuality here. 
Why do I have to be treated differently within the community?"	"You don't have to be treated differently, you're a boy so people should act with you according to this fact. Hope things will get better !
This is just high school shit/newly discovering your identity shit. Eventually everyone will talk about stuff other than their transness and you won’t feel singled out. While being trans isn’t a phase, the *talking about it constantly* part definitely is. 

Live and let live, stay in your lane, make friends with people you vibe with. Don’t be afraid to not associate closely with people who give you dysphoria, whether they’re cis or trans. :)
Honestly thought it would be obvious that I'm not a girl when my name is a boys name
Most people punch down. Esp if they’ve spent too much time as a punching bag
AGAB language is really useful for some things, but its just yucky hearing it in that context. The way it actually gets used is generally just as bad as the old MTF/FTM binary. It really shouldn't matter in any social situation. If I were in a room and someone said ""we're all transfemme"" I'd be like thats cool! If they said ""we're all AMAB"" I'd be out of there. Why do queer people feel the need to do this shit?
Is this a private school?

Where exactly does a school like this exist? Genuine question! D:
Dude I hate this shit. I’m so glad I’m not in HS anymore.

It gets a lot better once you’re out.

A lot of those people are just learning about this shit and barely know what these things mean, so they tend to have the nuance of a hatchet with shit.

Don’t be afraid to correct people and tell them “I’m a guy”. 

When you get out, you’ll be able to choose your social circle a lot more carefully and this shit won’t happen anymore.
Since your school is so open could you do a trans pronoun tag or pin on your shirt maybe?
Totally fair, you'd think that in a school full of trans kids we'd ditch the divisions and be accepting of each other.

But it turns out that when we achieve our common goal of not being stepped on by society we turn on each other. 

You're a boy, plain and simple. It doesn't matter how you were born, or how you look.
i feel this, my college is very similar. sometimes i think it's because i'm jealous of the people who pass better than me, but i do feel left out. idk
A good response to that example you gave of them saying ""everyone here is afab"" would be ""I'm not afab or amab. I am a man, and I am not going to let you force me back into the box that society placed me in by attaching unnecessary labels to me.""
Yeah kinda screw “afab” and “amab.” 🙁
I don't think amab or afab should be mentioned much at all unless its in a context towards medical or physical stuff. anatomy and gender are way too different categories. I'm sorry that gets in your life right now
hey dude. mtf here. i agree that when youre trans, talking to people your gender (the one you identify as) can be difficult. before transition i didnt talk to girls at all. i slowly learned that noone really cares about their gender till you mention it. you just need to find people with common interests, and who respect your pronouns, whatever you identify as. unfortunately there are 'gendered' interests. I'm interested in vintage technology, so i basically have to talk to 60yo men to make friends. anyway, i agree, afab, amab, its not you, youre a guy, period.
afab and amab do suck and they definitely are just ways of reenforcing the binary and r often used to exclude trans women from spaces. tell ppl you're a guy and your pronouns and ppl should respect it! it will get easier w practice and time 🖤. i'm sorry u feel like ppl aren't seeing u for who u are. also i will say trans/gay ppl making a big deal out of their transness or gayness is not such a bad thing. when you are marginalized it often feels like taking back power to center the thing ppl are trying to marginalize you for. idk, just a thought
Thank you! I feel bad for venting about this, because I know a lot of people are being bullied and misgendered at their schools, so I'm honestly very lucky to be where I am
My name is Jasper and people will say “isn’t that a boys name” yes. it is. because i’m a boy.
I thought the same, but people just say to me it’s gender neutral (it’s not!).
Yeah, this. Amab has a masculine connotation, and shouldnt be used for girls or fem people, unless you're specifically having a discussion that requires it (like, comparing how its like being raised as an amab person vs an afab person) and same goes for afab. It should only be used when necessary to make the distinction- which isn't often.
Maybe a metropolitan area? Really progressive LGBT friendly schools in my experience are usually in cities like New York, London, etc.
I don't know if I would be comfortable with that, but thank you anyway
Tribalism will always exist. The ego feeds on in-group vs out-group. When you escape outward conflict, we create internal conflict to re-establish a social hierarchy. It's inevitsble and inescapable.
I'm lucky that I've always had common interests with cisguys, but I don't really hang out with them because, well, they don't see me as a guy. I wish you luck with the 60yo men
No problem, and don't worry to much sometimes it's way better to vent than keeping things inside you :)
But like, ""almost no cishet people at all""?

That reads like a gay fantasy. I'd love it if it were true but, I mean? Even in highly progressive areas all the recent studies I've seen put LGBT students K-12 at 25-30% tops.

I mean maybe OP just only interacts with gay groups incidentally and doesn't see it, it just feels like a fantasy to me and I'm jealous and would like to be reborn into the world at the time and place this is possible please. 😥

Edit: My high school in mid 2000s had literally 17 out or closeted-but-out-to-friends gay people total, literally total. I knew all of them. I'm being absolutely serious about this. ^(Edit 2: at of a school of over 2000 students...)
Understandable, I hope it gets easier for you ❤️
'i wish you luck with the 60yo men' 😭 it makes me so sad lol
Actually, it's in Denmark. It's a boarding school, and known for being lgbt+ friendly Roleplaying school
My school had quite a few LGBTQ+ people in my year alone. In terms of who ik was LGBTQ+ in just my year there was 1 gay guy, 2 bisexual guys (1 left the school before coming out), 1 trans guy (left the school before coming out), 1 non-binary woman (came out later in life not while at school), 1 lesbian, and about 7 bisexual girls (myself included.) It was pretty glorious tbh even though I was the only queer girl who never got a gf ;\_; Some of the cis/het people used to complain that EVERYONE in the year was LGBTQ+ which annoyed me because that's literally like 12 people total, compared to everyone else in the year who was straight and cis. 

Anyways yeah I see your point, it is a bit odd to have a school where it really is the vast majority of students who are LGBTQ+, sounds like it would be a blast in a lot of ways.
That's becuase it is a fantasy, resulting from implicit bias. People create the reality they want to see or be a part of becuase they want to believe that's the way it is.

I'm not saying there aren't a lot, but when you come from 1% to 25% it feels like a million, even when you are still outnumbered 4 to 1 vs 100 to 1. It's mostly due to the fact that one doesn't feel so isolated anymore and so implicit bias takes over.
Oh, thanks for clarifying. What do you mean by roleplaying school though?
That's fucking awesome and I'm jealous. :(
God it would be the fucking dream.
Mostly queer people come to the boarding school because one of the subjects they can elect is cosplay, and there aren't many schools were you can choose cosplay
Yeah that sounds like a really good environment"	r6gukc	trans	299	0.99	2021-12-01 15:07:56
I accidentally misgendered my friend	I'm trans. My best friend is trans. Im at her house and accidentally misgendered her. I feel like absolute shit. I apologized, but damn, I know how much that hurts when random people do that to me. I could use some advice on how to proceed. Do I apologize to her again later? Let it go? I don't know what to do. I wouldn't hurt her for the world.	"Apologise then let it go, accidents happen you didn't do it maliciously
Apologize and move on. Mistakes happen. This is literally not the end of the world. By blowing it up like this you’re actually making it into a more painful situation and focusing the attention yourself instead of your friend
Mistakes happen and she probably knows that. Hell, most trans people (including myself !!!) misgender themselves sometimes. Best to just apologize and move on, if it's still bothering you in a few days you might want to politely ask again to make sure she's alright if just to settle your own nerves.   


I'm sure she knows that you didn't mean it maliciously.
Acknowledge it, feel it, own it and apologize.. And then move on.. don't get stuck on it.. letting it go is the best thing you can do for your friend.
Honestly I think making a big deal out of it isn't a good idea. It's OK, we slip up with words. Not the end of the world just don't be intentional
I got into a similar situation recently actually, I kiiinda deadnamed my friend at the absolute worst possible moment and it caused me to really melt down. Being MtF yourself its hard not to feel like you've betrayed that person and yourself, but I promise you, you haven't. There was no mal intent and, seriously, it was just an accident. If your friend knows you then they know that you don't see them that way. If it was really bad then make them something to show that you're sorry, but all in all it was just an accident. Brains are stupid and they slip up sometimes, its not a huge deal 😊
I hate that being trans yourself does not prevent this from happening. It feels like having the best intentions should prevent your brain from acting up this way, but it does not. Brains are frustrating sometimes.
It happens. Even cis people are sometimes misgendered. I probably misgender cis people more than trans people. My best friend (who is also trans) accidentally deadnamed me the other day and I habe dysphoria but I get that it wasn’t his fault and it’s fine
Let it go, this is a very common thing. I have lots of trans friends and I am agender. I misgender myself all the time. If you are used to a deadname, then sometimes it happens on accident. It's  way better to move on rather than apologize a lot. Your friend knows it wasnt on purpose.
As everyone else says, just let it go! I misgendered one of my friends after he'd been out for like five years. It was the first time I'd done it in years, but yeah, you just need to apologise and it's fine!
If you make a big deal out of it.. It'll make the situation worse.. I've been there.. Trust me.. So just move on
if you didnt mean any ill intent, forgive yourself for the mistake. apologize, and im sure your friend has already put it behind them.
You have already apologized, drop it I am sure your friend already has.  There is a big difference between purposefully misgendering someone and doing it o. Accidents
i have a weird speech pattern bc of my adhd and weed use and i accidentally misgendered my bf a few times, he's done it to me too lol. it hurts in the moment but it isnt the end of the world, slips of words happen
I'm not trans but people misgender me sometimes. It is difficult but you hopefully don't need to worry
Eh not that big a deal imo unless they’ve just recently transitioned and are sensitive. It should be treated the same as misgendering a cis person, as no big deal just a word slip.
just tell her sorry and that all, nothing happens if someone uses the wrong words because what matters is how she feels qwq
I misgendered an agender person I was dating and we broke up because of it (basically). I felt horrible. But also a lot of other red flags and prolly dodged a bullet
Explain it the way you did here on reddit. Tell her that you never want/ed to hurt her and that you're sorry. Ask her how she feels about it. And then, when you've talked about it with her, let it go. Bc I imagine it's quite annoying and unsettling if you can't stop apologising 🤷‍♂️
Thanks friend. I definitely didn't do it on purpose.
Thank you. I needed to hear that.
Or FtM, or nonbinary, I really shouldn't assume 😊
This is absolutely right.  Remember that cis people get accidentally misgendered too, and you wouldn't make a huge deal out of it for them - so don't make a big deal out of it when you accidentally misgender us."	u0pi6y	trans	299	0.97	2022-04-10 19:53:04
It feels like I’m just holding on for future me and I hate it	"I come home dead inside after every day of school (6 days a week) and it makes me not want to live anymore. I can’t take another day of my tuck constantly being undone, of being misgendered and deadnamed by my family. Of my brother and dad going on transphobic rants about my trans friend. I can’t take another day of waking up and not feeling like how I’m supposed to feel, I want to be able to take off a hoodie and like my physique, I want to be able to pierce my fucking ears and get earrings without having to justify myself and still getting rejected. I want to be able to put on lipstick and grow my hair out without having to remove it 2 minutes after taking pictures. 

But from where I am now, I can’t do that and this pain is killing me. I’ve wanted to resort to self harm more times than I care to admit but I know I can’t since that’ll make it harder for me in a few months when I go to college. And it feels like I’m guarding my fragile mental state and barely holding on every day for me in the future."	"get them pierced. piercings are not gendered they are for anyone willing to sit still and get a needle jammed into them.
I know a few months seems like a long time, but your world will open up a lot when you head off to college. At least make it until then! Hopefully you are moving out of your parents’?
As someone who looks “manly man man” at work all day and usually at home, I’ve found painting my nails, and of course my undergarment choice really helps “calm the mind” when it comes to “self hate” or “not liking your body”. It’s small, not always going to help you feel better, but it’s something. 

Also, if you drive, get you some nice, pretty, goodwill finds/thrift store stuff, and keep in the car. Might seem silly, but I keep in my travel bag dresses, skirts, crop tops, leggings, stockings, just cute Shit to make me feel good. When I have a long drive or literally just a little bit to myself I’ll change and just have time to myself. 

You got this, you will one day look in the mirror and be happy, and just know that there is no time limit to achieve your happiness. Took me a little over 20 years to finally start to see the light at the end of the tunnel. 

Don’t lose hope my friend.

Edit: some spelling, and a missing bit about the car thing, because I’m currently in panic mode trying to find parts for my welder on a Sunday 200 miles from my shop 🤷‍♀️😂
I can relate to the transphobic parents. But I’ve found momentary happiness in coming out to my close friends and not my family. That way I don’t have to act like someone else all day. I understand that presenting how you want can be physically exhausting and mentally tiring. I have problems with binding my chest too much and I get rib pain a lot. Try to find clothes that get the result you want without being really rough on your body. Like instead of tucking maybe some form of compression bottom wouldn’t hurt your body so much. Your struggle is seen and I’m really rooting for you OP! Being in a toxic family and in the trans closest around them is very hard. I’m 22 and still have to be a fake person when I go home but it gets better I promise.
It's not the same ofcourse but if you want to feel a tiny bit more feminine sometimes while hiding you can get some regular lipbalm. Maybe flavored if you can get it. 
And a hair tie around your wrist as a subtle bit of jewelry. Maybe a gemstone pendant around you neck. Those can look pretty manly but you know it's just a necklace.
Real talk? That future is a lot closer than you realize, and it’ll be a distant memory before you even realize what happened. You’re getting real close to that point where suddenly a year or two feels like *nothing* in terms of time.  Perception of time at 18 and perception of time at 23 are *wildly* different. Add another five years and it’s even more pronounced. 

I feel like my coming out was like… a recent thing. But it was legit two years ago. I feel like my moving to my current home was just a year or so ago. It was *four*. I vividly remember saving up to move to my city and how excited I was to get here and it feels like I’ve only been here a few years. That was *twelve years ago*. 

You’ve got this. I promise.
Hey I know it sucks but please don't harm yourself.  The best thing you can do now is focus on your education so you can get a good job and be financially secure as soon as possible.  Once that happens you will be truly free from your parents and will have the resources to fully realize your true self.  Every single day that passes is one day closer to freedom for you.  Live for that day!
I feel the same. Future me will be a lot better and I'll feel more comfortable in my own skin once 5 or less years have passed.
[deleted]
This hit so hard
Please do not choose a permanent solution to a temporary problem!!

I know that sometimes it's hard to see a future for yourself when the present is so oppressive.  It can feel like a weight crushing your chest while your stomach does summersaults as it's being tied into knots.

Keep your friends and your allies closest and lean on them.  Throw yourself into the things that you love, that bring you joy and clutch them tightly to your chest.  Never let go.  Let those people, places, and things be your anchor and I promise you there's no storm you can't weather.

I know it may not feel like it right now but you are becoming stronger every day, with every slight.  Never let their narrative play as the voice in your mind.  When that voice betrays you, correct it.  Control it.  Practice.  You're the author of your own story.  You get to choose.

I've always found that mediation has helped me calm the stirrings of the mind.  I found my center that way.  It's like having a little home out in the forest that know one knows about and can get to but me.  A retreat into your mind where you might find some solace.

Given the nature of your hostile living situation I'd suggest finding subtle ways to remind yourself of who you are.  

It can be as simple as clear coating your toe nails or wearing chapstick.  Something that can be fundamentally feminine by your own perception but isn't visible in a way that may expose you to harm.
Hope you find a way out of your situation soon, i know how hard it can be when your reliant on others who aren't accepting, hope u can become self sustainable and get in a better place soon
You have identified your feelings and you are reaching out - that is amazing!!! Keep following those feelings and build more support around you. Call a self harm hotline *now* and ask them to help find resources in your area and some strategies to follow when things feel overwhelming. You can take control and make plans!!!

This is bigger, but you may want to also start considering an exit strategy. I understand you consider yourself financially dependent on your parents, but that might make it even more important to look at what your options honestly are if the financial support is removed. Again talk with people who can give you real life options so you can take control and make decisions about your life. Find people who want to help you do that and who have the expertise to do so.

If nothing else seems possible, DM me. I'm an old, silly computer geek, but I'm told I'm easy to talk to, and I will make time for you because you are worth it.
I know its hard, but you say you've got a few months.  A few months and you're FREE. 

The hardest part of the mountain is when you are almost to the top, because you are exhausted from the climb that got you there. Do you wanna quit now, when you are so close to reaching that goal?

please dont harm or kill yourself. You are \*so close\*. Please.
For the piercings you could just use the excuse that it looks punk and most cishet guys will buy it
I am so sorry you’re unable to transition right now. Please do not harm yourself. It won’t help anything, trust me. It may even make things worse. There are some things you can do now. You can pierce your ears. It’s pretty gender neutral. You can grow out your hair some. You can use the hair to hide you ears if your uncomfortable showing earrings to your family.
But I’m currently financially dependent on my parents and can’t afford one on my own. My mom refuses to let me because ‘it’s a slippery slope and the devil is always trying to recruit young souls’
I am, moving onto campus
Thank you and I’ll try some form of compression
i second gem jewelry, they come in all kinds chain styles to (at least what i've seen) even the dainty chain ones look gender neutral/androgynous
That is how I feel
You need to work on breaking that dependence asap because because financially dependence on christoids makes it super easy for them to enforce the rules of their braindead cult on you.
Nothing in the bible states anything negative about piercings.

Unless a slave to a master you refuse to leave is bad.

“He shall be brought to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall then remain his slave for life” (Exodus 21:6)

[source](https://www.jta.org/jewniverse/2011/piercing-in-the-bible) (i had to look it up cuz i remember a friend my brother had done this but as a significance to Christ and God rather than a Master)

&#x200B;

Edit: I'm not religious by any means but I know random facts and look things up on it
Have you done any research as to what is available at your university? Maybe it will help you! Check out their LGBTQ resources and organizations. Some universities even have gender support services and an endocrinologist on site if you are thinking about HRT.
I think a lot of us can get angry at the world and not want to be around anymore when we can’t be who we are. But I kindly ask that you take the anger at the world and people in your life and find an outlet for it. Be it writing, talking about it, or any hobby that makes you feel better. Just please do not take that anger out on yourself or your body. You’re going to go far Brony I just know it!
Very true.
So there really is nothing to support her argument then, thanks for the information
Honestly, I haven’t really thought about that
Thank you, it means so much <3
I mean unless she brings in the ""my house my rules"" 
My mom was thankfully never like this with piercings or me changing my hair color probably at least once every 3 months. Whenever i got a new piercing at home was like ""does work care?"" ""Didnt that hurt?"" 

Plus it's a piercing. Lets say one day (after they've healed) you aren't a fan anymore. You can just take them out.
Their arguments don't rest on evidence, or logic, or anything but their feelings.
She is ‘my house, my rules’ or she tells me to ask my dad who’s Texas level conservative
I mean you could use that Bible reasoning in a way to get it, but idk how you'd feel about it
Can you please tell me the Bible reasoning
>“He shall be brought to the doorpost, and his master shall pierce his ear with an awl; and he shall then remain his slave for life” (Exodus 21:6)

This is the verse, but basically a promise to always serve God and Jesus.So essentially a ""slave/indentured servant"" to God and Jesus til you can move out to appease the folks and get the piercing. If it works.

Apparently online game voice chats aren’t safe. Who’d have thought.	"So for some background, I’m a 21 year old trans girl and have been doing voice training for a fair while now. I’ve reached a point where I feel pretty confident in my voice and talk openly whenever. Today I decided to play a game I hadn’t played in over a year called SCP: Containment breach. Now, the thing about this game is that voice chat is a MASSIVELY important part of it. I’d had no prior problems before transitioning, so I didn’t worry about it.

Sadly, it didn’t take long for a guy to start sexually harassing me as soon as he heard me. It was freaky and I ended up stopping playing for a bit to go to my birthday dinner with the rest of my family. I got on again later in the night and things went well for a solid hour until I realized that some people were calling me he and that guy and stuff even after hearing me.

I just… don’t get it. Am I cursed with some sort of androgynous voice that invites sexual harassment AND misgendering? I really thought I was doing well with my voice stuff but right now I just wish I could go mute. It certainly didn’t make my birthday any better."	"I’m sorry for that. The internet in general is so awful at times, video games being the worst for women due to these kids and awful people who like to be toxic just because of the anonymous nature. 

I hope you keep enjoying the nerdiness regardless of what it is. This is why the block voice chat is seen more and more in games. I hope you have a better day. Happy birthday!
Happy birthday!

And yeah, the weird validation of getting vote kicked from a game because you were recognized as a girl on voice chat. Also not sure which is worse, people telling me I sound gross, or that I sound hot and asking me personal questions when I'm trying to give callouts in Siege. : |
Some people are just terrible, it sucks. I'm sorry you experienced that. People who act that way aren't a good metric for any measure of yourself or your voice. They aim to offend and they try to hurt. Take care of yourself. Maybe you can find a friendly group on discord, maybe an LGBTQIA+ gamer discord??
Just wanted to say that some of the folks misgendering you *may* have been doing it out of habit - it could be that they're more likely to think you're a kid or a dude with a high pitch voice before they would realize a *girl* might be among them. (How scandalous!) Might be guys who don't wanna offend/provoke another guy by saying they sound girly. Not to defend or endorse that behavior, just trying to say please don't be too hard on yourself about it, I don't think it's a reflection of your voice itself but just of how dumb men on the internet are.
That sounds painful! I don’t really have any advice on how to deal with that. I make no attempts to alter my voice because it scares me to try. So obviously I get misgendered on the phone, which is painful but understandable.

In case you didn’t know and you have the means, there are three different voice feminization surgery options available for trans women. That’s what I want to pursue.
two possibilties:  
1. voice is sus

2. you, like any other woman gets harassed by men in online voice. A cis woman tiktoker playing CoD had a few videos where she got misgendered the whole game and they accused her of being a boy and using a voice changer. She didn't even have a deep voice and that one really opened my eyes.  Men online just harass women.
People suck. And yeah guys can be aggressive and rude. Unfortunately.
I usually  have everyone who I'm friends with in a party but I'm usually just the only one in the party talking to myself lol.
I guess it depends on the community you play with as well, a more hardcore gameplay environment tends to invite people who are less compassionate and understanding (in a nice way to put it).

I’ve been playing FFXIV and I think my voice is hardly passable, but I’ve joined a few random parties and never really had an issue so far. I wouldn’t dare even trying to speak in Apex or Valorant.
I love that game! It doesn’t run well on my laptop though and I tend to just play in extremely small servers (like three other people) with no voice chat just to play a glorified game of hide and seek. It’s fun! I know where you’re coming from though; I play destiny religiously and while voice chat isn’t a major major part of the game, for a lot of modes it is. I haven’t done anything with my voice so I still sound squeaky and girly and have gotten misgendered before even with clanmates :( but for the most part my clan and friends are super awesome and make it worth it, I had horrible calling anxiety before I got into destiny and now I’m still nervous about it but I’ve gotten to the point where I can throw on my headset and hop on with friends without freaking out. It’s great. Anyway, yeah, - sounding feminine at all will get you treated like shit. Don’t listen to them though, I wouldn’t even recommend staying in a server with aholes like that. I’m sorry op
I play a lot of SCP and run into this pretty often too, literally the best measure is just to find other queer SCP players (there's a surprisingly high number of them) and either run private servers or take over empty ones. It sucks but it's all that can really be done
I've played that game, I have a high voice and they were all like ""oh my god is that a girl?"" It wasn't harassment thankfully, but like, yeah.
:( I’m so sorry friend. I know this is a stretch but, if you’re on PS4 and you ever play GTA, I need friends and if anyone talks to you the wrong way I will literally rip them a new a$$h0l3 😂
I’m also a trans woman and I naturally have a deep voice and I can only raise my voice to an /sigh/ cringe alert!! I can change it to only one voice that sounds girly and it’s a anime girl voice I worked on for a year and Yh it doesn’t go well so I just avoid talking and lip things and don’t talk unless I’m with a friend or two and or at home even than I don’t talk much
Thank you dear. Luckily, the game in question let’s you mute people individually pretty easily. I’m just… scared now. As well as anxious about my voice not passing. I’ve lost a fair amount of confidence.
Honestly though! It’s just like… walking on a thin line constantly and worrying you’ll get harassed.
Maybe. I don’t think it had to do with me being trans though. In fact, I don’t think anyone clocked me. The guy who harassed me very firmly seemed to believe I was a girl and was insistent on getting into my pants. The server idea might be good though. Or I just don’t play it…
Yeah dude bro culture is pretty common in games, especially games like SCP with the shooting and the killing and such. I have a transfem friend who is super into gaming culture and she constantly refers to me as ""dude."" It used to bother me but I've just accepted it, its just part of the climate shes in a lot.

Everyone is assumed dude until proven otherwise (and even sometimes after that by right of gamer dude passage). Im sure if OP found a way to bring it up in conversation to correct them they would've switched, but then of course youre back to playing chicken with the first problem.

Someone above said a LGBTQ+ discord server might help and I second it, I love that game (even if its been a bit since I played)!
I suppose that’s true. I just get hyper anxious about these types of things because I want to be viewed as a woman 24/7 and I get scared that if I don’t pass well enough, I’ll get hurt. I’ll try to gently correct in the future and avoid aggressive interactions.
The surgeries are a bit too scary for me to try. I think I just need to try harder with being consistent with my voice. I’m just confused because my voice therapist said that I always sound female.
Wait, WHAT?!?! That’s just paranoia on the guys part at that point. Also, whatcha mean by “voice is sus”?
That’s the thing though. It’s not a competitive game in the slightest. It’s more of just a goof around type of game. And I actually did speak in valorant once while playing with my girlfriend and no one gave me any trouble, so that makes me more confused. I guess it wasn’t ranked though…
Noted. Thank you
It’s weird because I met someone else while playing who sounded EXTREMELY fem, and no one mentioned it. I guess it just depends on who’s on the server?
I play on PC and don’t have GTA, sorry. Thanks for the invite though!
Fwiw hon', a lot of people online - and I mean a *lot* - just assume that everyone is a dude until told otherwise. Especially in games. 

Unless you have THE most unmistakably feminine voice ever, or self-identify openly as soon as you join the chat, some people are gonna hear you and assume you're a younger person or just a guy with a high voice. I have a couple cisfem friends who get misgendered in chat all the time. Something-something patriarchal society. 

I'm sure you're passing just fine. \^^ I mean, goodness' sake... you said yourself that you were getting harassed by some guy earlier in the evening for being a girl, so clearly someone got the right idea. I'm really sorry that happened to you btw 😥 But yeah. If they saw you *and* heard you, I bet it'd be a different story. Some people just don't pick up on gender in voice on vc.
It not an issue. You shouldn’t let them get you down as they are not fair critics of your voice. Shake it off and relax. It’s not easy but you can move passed this and get back to being yourself.
There’s no such thing as “passing” or “not passing” if you consider that you are a woman no matter what voice you have.  It doesn’t matter what your voice sounds like, it IS the voice of a woman because you ARE a woman.  Aiming to feminize is a personal choice, and I’m right there with you with trying to sound more feminine, but do it for you, not for them.  If you need a confidence boost, think of the voice of an old cis woman who has smoked their whole life.  If your voice can sound more feminine than that, you’re doing better than some cis women out there.  Just keep the low end of the range in mind.
I don't play the game, but did you happen to have like a male avatar? Maybe they were talking about the character and not you IF that was the case.
Of course, I just think the odds of running into misogynistic asshats is lower on queer discord lol
Are you sure it was your voice, and not something content-based that made someone catch on, and tell the others?
Definitely luck of the draw. I was even asked my pronouns once, though I felt a little singled out given they didn't ask any of the other deeper voiced folks what their pronouns were. I recommend having pals join you online and that helps keep your head in the fun!
I’ll certainly try. I’ll just have to focus really hard on my voice in the future.
All of the characters in the game are male because of sexism and patriarchy I guess. You get assigned a random class at the start of the game, but all of them are either guys or monsters.
Fair point. Sorry
I don’t think so. No one was referring to me as a gay in any sort of malicious or hateful way and it was only a few of the people on the server. I think they legit just thought I sounded like a guy or maybe a kid?
Smart. That person I mentioned did have a friend with them.
Good luck and have a great day.
No apologies needed! Im sorry you experienced this. You deserved better

Finally got gendered correctly by a stranger!	It seemed to be a “I’m clearly transgender and this guy was nice” situation and not an “I passed” situation but it’s the first time I’ve gotten treated kindly instead of ignored or pointedly misgendered. I was out on a date with my partner tonight and the waiter made a solid effort to gender me correctly. It was really sweet and it made me feel a touch more like a regular person.	"That's beautiful. I'm happy for you <3
That’s sweet
＼ʕ •ᴥ•ʔ／
it’s definitely the best feeling when strangers correctly gender you :) it happened to me the first time in philly at a hotel and the lady at the desk used he/him pronouns on me. and for mine it was also a “this person is transgender” kinda situation i think but it still made me feel really good :))
A starbucks barista made a great effort to use my name and stuff the other day and it meant the world to me. I didn’t even have a binder on because I was going to be moving stuff all day and needed more support. It’s such a great feeling!
Wooo! That’s always the best feeling! 👏👏👏
wait y'all feel good when us cis allies do that?

I'll keep doing what i have been, which is calling people by their preferred pronouns"	twp0zv	trans	292	0.96	2022-04-05 07:05:52
Affecting me more then I thought...	"Just need to vent a little I suppose (trigger warning transphobia, misgendering, religion and all that)







I got a voicemail from my grandmother early this morning with her saying my full legal deadname and basically saying she'll ""never accept what I'm doing to my body"" and that I was ""born a boy so I'll always be a boy"". Now this isn't a grandma I was ever too attached too and she's hyper religious and I thought if this were to happen I'd be able to brush it off cuz its something I expected. But it's getting to me The further on into the day it goes and now I'm just dwelling on it. I feel like I need to get the last word in but I know she'd never let that happen or get my dad involved, who I'm sure is the one that told her. My dad has been very silent about all this since I came out on fb and the last thing I heard from him he sent me a text saying that he loves me and Jesus loves me. Which aggravated me too. That entire part of my family I would rather just forget about and just chill with my mom's side who couldn't be more supportive. I just wish my dad and grandma could see just how happy I am since starting my gender affirming care. I really don't know what was going through her head like I'd be ""oh well gee grandma I guess you're right. I'll listen to you and stop taking hormones after two years and then I'll be too depressed to do anything and probably end up [redacted] myself. Sounds swell!"" All she did was officially lose me and my sister who is now on the warpath if she ever sees her again.

Anyways I'm just rambling at this point. Thank you for reading if you've gotten this far. I just needed to shout into the void for a bit."	"You want to get the last word in?

Live your life and be happy.

That is the ultimate last word.
I'm sorry you have to deal with this.  

If you have a therapist, I recommend speaking with them about it.   

Additionally, what I'm doing right now to combat some of this, is writing letters. I'm writing them and sending them to people who I don't feel comfortable having actual conversations with. In the letter, I'm stating who I am, what this means, and setting clear boundaries about our interactions going forward. If they can't follow those rules, then they're getting cut off and blocked. No exceptions.  

Good luck, love.
My grand mother did this too me, except her response was horrible.

I told her I was transgender a long time ago, she commented that I didn’t act very feminine. She then proceeded with “you’re going to hell.” And one day after she said that to my face, I commented this: “Oh you really want me in hell, don’t you?” She commented “No, I just want you to realize what you’re doing is wrong.” Then I commented: “I thought the Bible stated for you not to judge others? And last I saw, you’re judging me and treating me like shit, you say you love me. But you’re treating me like shit.” After that she and I stopped talking about it. I guess yeah I can act like a boy, but I feel like a woman, I just can’t believe the way she treated me and I’m happy that she stopped saying that shit. I believe in god, but I doubt he cares about me in specific in relation to gender.
Ya, her message wasn't very helpful. Really can't have a conversation based on that.

Some people aren't very good with words or feelings though. Some people want to help their family but don't know how, since they can't understand what you are going through.

So instead they lash out.

""You can't force me to change how I speak."" Is probably what she thinks she said. 

But what you are hearing is ""I hate you"".

So her message wasn't helpful in the slightest.

Let it pass. Make more progress and when she sees the awesome person you are developing into her mind may change.

Just don't get mad. Don't yell and set a positive example. Your positive attitude towards them will show how you expect them to treat you.
I definitely understand this, but mine is about my old roommates, people I thought were honest friends. Well, we started to have some friction after I came out. These are two white boys who are not used to feeling uncomfortable or like they dont have the upper-hand in every situation. Long story short, one of them comes home one day and threatens me with legal action if I dont leave the house(that I lived in first and invited them to live in). I happen to know 100% that they conspired with my landlord to find a way to forcibly evict me. I have no solid evidence of transphobia though, so I couldnt report them to the university we all go to, although anyone who looked at the situation could tell it wasnt about the 3 times I was 1 day late on rent. Everytime I think about it, I get mad. For the first few months I was mad a lot, until I realized that the way for me to win and not them was to prove them wrong, graduate from college, have a great job, and live a happier life than them. Now I do. I am in an internship that pays great with a job lined up that I love, and they are going to be professors(maybe, lol) at a dying university, studying a subject of little note or importance to students who will hate them because they are jerks :)

Anger and annoyance feels bad, if you are angry long enough it starts to make you sick, its unhealthy. Take a deep breath, let it go, and focus on you. Good luck out there <3

I heard something about Elon Musk wanting to take away a misgender rule on Twitter? Does someone know more abiut this and want to share it with me/explain me the whole situation? Dont wanna judge someone for something I dont understand.		"In a twitter post, he said he would remove rules prohibiting people from using slurs, and would remove penalties for ""things that do not harm"" people... and he cited misgendering as an example.

EDIT: Per requests, I have searched for the tweet I had originally read. I have not been able to find it, and secondary reporting is not showing results either due to the amount of smoke being blown up his ass by the media.

I did see a comment in this regard, but I encourage you to take it with a grain of salt as I can not provide a citation towards, only a personal memory of reading the comment. The possibility I confused its source (such as a podcast, or such) or I have completely misattributed the speaker are all viable.
\*Follows post for information\*
Who here wants to bet Musk’s Mars colony will be full of these shits
I don’t think he’s said much of anything yet. Anything you hear without a source isn’t going to be reliable, and it’s not worth worrying about until we hear more from the horses mouth or they implement new policy.

If I had to guess, it’s based on Elon saying he is moving it to “free speech “ values which in the US typically means spending a lot of time defending hate speech while ignoring minorities concerns about rising violence.

Personally I expect him to do things that will be bad for marginalized communities but I think it is better to wait before we start expending a lot of energy about it
We can have fun awhile on Twitter to harass Elon, saying our peace, and calling him Grrrrl.
Um last I checked there isn’t even a rule on twitter for misgendering someone right now
IMHO, it's too early to have any idea what he's going to do with the platform until he starts doing things. No one knows. Not really.
*but guys it’s ok he’s WEIRD and QUIRKY and posts ANIME stuff plus he said he was a Socialist!!!*
To be honest. Who really knows? We are talking about the most sporadic billionaire of the lot. The Twitter purchase came out of nowhere. He created a company entirely off the basis that he was frustrated in traffic. He tweets shit that somehow pisses every side off. He just, does and says shit with little to no consequences. 

So like, on one hand, I wouldn’t be surprised if he quoted ‘free speech’ and let loose. But also I totally expect him to have an algorithm implemented to suppress anyone that talks bad about him or his companies. We have to watch and see what happens I guess.
[removed]
There is no punishment for misgendering someone (on Twitter). It happens by accident all the time over there, let alone on purpose. He might just be talking about Twitter's new flags that advise people not to cuss. The whole concept here has been blown out of proportion.

Edit: It's interesting that I'm getting downvoted for this. How is he going to make it easier to be rude on twitter? Add a button that says ""misgender""? Pronouns aren't a required part of a twitter profile, and only reporting for abuse results in any action by the site. So how will he make this worse?!
Where can I see his tweet?
I’d lose my shit if twitter stocks suddenly plummet into the oblivion after this lmao
Musky boy is literally buying out twitter over his ex getting with a trans woman then. (It definitely also benefits his ties to conservative politics/his tendency to try and bury information about unethical things he’s done)

But that bitch is petty and conniving, it’s absolutely because of Grimes leaving him to uhaul it with Chelsea Manning
I'm not sure they ever banned anyone for misgendering in any case.  I found Twitter to be a very unsafe place for trans people - they ban us for fighting back more than they ever ban transphobes.

If anything, Musk is just going to pull the mask from an already toxic platform.
Interested to see the tweet. Looked at everything in the last 24 hours and couldn't find anything.
\*ANGRY HEAVY CRUISER FIRING SALVOES AT THE SPEED THAT WOULD MAKE A DD BLUSH AND TURN A CITY INTO A CRATER IN MINNUTES\*

TRY FEELING LIKE A FUCKING IOWA CLASS BB PLAYED HOME RUN DERBY WITH YOU AND ONE OF IT'S 16""/50 CAL MARK 7'S AND THEN GOT DROPPED ON YOU. EVERY TIME I GET MISGENDERED I JUST WANT TO FUCKING BAWL AND THEN DISEMBOWEL THE OFFENDING HUMAN.

Sorry for the huge angry rant
I just looked at his Twitter and I don't see such thing. Did I miss anything or can you maybe share a link?
[deleted]
I said it as a joke before and I'll say it again on a more serious note: Elon Musk is gonna become God Emperor on Mars.
My take is that ""free speech"" stuff is a ruse Elon Musk threw out to distract people from the fact that the richest man in the world is buying an enormous social media platform. Banks had to put up the $42 billion he paid for it. They wouldn't get a return on it if Musk ran it into the ground by turning it into an unmoderated cesspool, so I doubt there's going to be that much change. We should focus on one thing we know to be true: that the richest man in the world is buying a big-ass megaphone for himself. That's not my idea of ""free speech"".
Just constantly remind him that Grimes left him for Chelsea Manning
Dollars to donuts, he will unban Trump 😡
The only major bans I can think of are Graham Lineman and the Babylon Bee. The rest of them are still free to spread their bullshit
Not only are there no rules against it, Elon stating that he’d like to allow people to misgender others due to “free speech” REALLY shows where his head is at
Mac Protests Gay Marriage
He’s a spoiled child who’s lived his entire life in extreme wealth and privilege, it doesn’t surprise me that he’s like this.
Musk be like “I’m gonna let you misgender trans people” mf we are a marginalised community, they let you do that anyway
It was a week or so when he first started talking about buying it
>DOES HE NOT REALIZE HOW PAINFUL MISGENDERING AND SLURS ARE?

The only thing he's ever realized is the joy he takes in being a dickhead. He's a fucking moron.
Yeaa but also. Its twitter. 
Anything more than observing from a distance just turns into a big toxic mess.
Also his main message is complete unaltered freedom of speech. 
So people can say whatever they want but in turn you can say whatever the fuck you want back.
Elon dosent seem like the toxic masculinity type. He changed his twitter name to Elona musk for a while because he got called feminine.
Also i swear he didn't even have control over the company yet?
Yea he has a controlling share but he rejected being on the board because being on the board would limit how many shares he could own meaning he couldn't buy it.
He’s an empty man he cares about nothing beyond himself. You can see it in the lines on his face and the vacancy in his eyes.
Supposedly, yes
He's good for the 42 billion though, which is the problem.
Gawd! I can’t keep up. I thought she just had another baby with him.
Precisely my point. Like, he wants to make it easier? How??
Many countries in Europe can enforce they’re law, elon is not free as he believes.
Tweet searched. Harm, misgender and pronoun and cant find anything relevent.
Please, a source? I hate the man so I wouldn’t be surprised but ya know, I’d like proof
Yea just saw it got announced an hour or so ago they accepted the offer.

I'm going to call this cis fragility	"It frustrates me when cis people come here with oftentimes genuine questions about trans people, only to get defensive or argumentative when people politely explain the answers to them. It's like their ego gets bruised when they are confronted with their ignorance, and they lash out because they can't take it. 

I'll admit I acted similarly about 3 years ago. I misgendered someone over discord voice chat. Everyone corrected me, and I apologized and said I didn't know. Afterwards I felt like everyone had been harsh or unfair to me, instead of just learning from my mistake. 
Then the same situation happened to me after coming out and I got a taste of what it feels like to be misgendered."	"I think it more has to do with the fact that our culture(s) enforce the idea that being wrong/mistaken is bad/shameful to the point that our natural instinct is to get defensive, deflect, and lash out at those who point out our mistakes.  This unfortunately leads to avoidance of learning from one's mistake because just admitting the mistake is looked down upon.  

This is why I do my best to never shame anyone's mistakes, but to genuinely congratulate them for sharing the experience with me so that we can both improve.  Also, why I jump at the chance to not only admit my mistakes (especially if they are pointed out) and then go all  Saturday morning cartoon and explain what I learned and how to apply it in the future. (gotta set an example).

I know I won't change the cultural norm, but I don't have to play along with it either on this.
Yeah, I had someone try to go off on me, block me, and then try to start shit about trans people in general and me in specific in a bunch of ""please validate me"" subreddits. And it was because I called their very uninformed but confidently asserted beliefs as uninformed. 

It was pretty funny.
I got in a fight with my mom once like this. She asked me something about being trans so I answered her. My answer didn’t line up with what she had read online, which she told me was a little confusing. So I started explaining why what she read online wasn’t accurate and she took it like I was telling her she was wrong and got all defensive. The conversation devolved super quickly into an argument that had nothing to do with trans people and everything to do with her self-consciousness about being corrected. I was so mad at the time that I completely blanked on pointing out that she was the one seeking information in the first place.
THANK YOU!! Sorry for raising my voice there, hah, but you've put into words something I've been experiencing a lot lately. The wall-of-text angry DM I got yesterday from a cis woman who didn't like my polite-but-assertive criticism of her questions just sort of proves our point: walking into the space for a particular community and getting upset that you can't demand satisfactory answers to invasive questions is the very definition of privilege blindness.

Or, rather, cis fragility! Thank you! And I'm sorry you're having to put up with any of that.
YES. Cis fragility. Can we coin this term and add it to DEI training right away?

Maybe this will help someone else	"Story time~
So, last year I came out to my father. I hadn’t visited him 6 months prior, as I was starting my transition. When I finally found the courage, I went over and told him immediately. He laughed and said, “that’s why you haven’t been coming over?” He accepted me, or so I thought at the time. 

So, as time went on, two weeks of him joking about it and finally I told him I’m not his son anymore, and to call me by Gabby or use my female pronouns. In a huff, he almost yelled back, “I made ya and I’ll call ya whatever I damn well please!”

I had enough. I left and went home. My roommate told me to tell him to f*ck off, and even though I wanted to, I know my dad cared about me and really desired me in his life, as I am his only child. 

So, I went back over the next day, he was joking as he usually was, he’s quite the comedian, and then started to misgendered me again and get mad when I once again told him to use my correct pronouns and/name. But this time, I said, “Dad, look. I’m gonna be honest. I love you and I want you in my life and I want to be a part of yours. But I don’t have to. I don’t have to talk to you or visit. I choose to, and the way you’re acting about this makes me want to choose otherwise.” He stopped talking and was quiet for a while. Eventually things returned less awkward, we watched a movie and just hung out as usual. But when I was about to go home, he hugged me and called me Gabby. Without a joke, without sarcasm. And from then on he hasn’t once misgendered me since. Even after I moved halfway across the country, he texts me and sends me Hello Kitty gifs (I love HK). 

TL:DR
If you have a family member that you know really loves you but they’re not getting the big deal with your gender identity, let them know your being around them is your choice. And they might lose that privilege.

Edit: wow, this blew up. Thanks everyone for your support, I wish you all the best~ much love."	"Cis people need to hear this too.

Can't tolerate abuse just because it is from family.
That is beautiful. The way you stood up for yourself, and the way he came to respect that. I'm glad you two can move forward together, and be a part of each other's life.
its enough to make a grown trans cry
Well, this only works when your parents love you and didn’t say “I actually never really wanted you” to your face =.= (thanks mom, the feeling is mutual)
I'm in a similar situation, i haven't yet reached resolution but I'm working on it, thank you!
It's a complicated situation. Social media tells us to be intolerant with this type of shit - and by all means, we should not tolerate it - but want it or not, they act that way because they feel threatened and scared of losing someone they love, they don't want the situation, the person they care about, to change. My first reaction is to go with empathy first and to acknowledge the way they feel, and then explain how essential this is to you. If they chose to be an asshole and not accept you for who you are even when they know how you feel, then fuck them. But I think it's good to remember that it can be hard for them too, as it is hard for you
This made me cry

"Does anyone else ever feel like cis people are just ""playing along""?"	"I'm not saying ""all cis people"" of course. People in the queer community often seem to understand, though not always. My wife is good about it and gets it. But many of the people around me that I'm out to - liberals, even - often seem like they're just playing along.  

I'm 34 and have curated my family and friend relationships pretty well throughout my life, so coming out wasn't TOO hard. I mean, it was hard. But not as hard as so many others. So just about everyone has been super supportive. Congrats, hugs, excitement, some surprise but still overall and overwhelming support.  

I'm 2 months on hormones now and I've asked everyone to use my chosen name and pronouns. I don't always present entirely feminine, but I have breasts, I've lasered off most of my facial hair, my hair is longer, and my face is noticeably more feminine. I don't really look like a guy. I don't look like a girl yet, but I don't look like a guy.   

When I'm talking to trans friends, I see it and hear it in how they talk to me. They see a woman. No problem. No misgendering or anything. They treat me like a woman and they're not putting on a show.  

But when I'm talking to some of my cis friends, you can hear it in their cadence. Or see it in the way they look at me. Or the things they say. They're stumbling over pronouns, occasionally misgendering (normally correcting themselves), trying to decide if they're treating me like one of the guys or one of the girls...  

I get that people are adjusting to the transition. I just feel like some people don't ""get it."" They know what they're ""supposed"" to do, but they don't really get what makes us the gender we're transitioning to. Like it's more of a ""hey I prefer this,"" rather than ""I AM this.""  

Does this make sense? I don't know if I'm explaining it correctly. But it's definitely something that bugs me. I want people to see me as a woman, because I AM a woman. I don't want them to play along forever."	"I think what you may seeing here is people working hard to go against their programming.

I grew up in a homophobic world and the grooves that this has worn in my brain are deep. My thoughts often drift into transphobic and homophobic places, even though i am Trans, but the very act of intercepting these thoughts before they harm people around me is something that I take pride in. 

A misgender that get immediately corrected is something i appreciate because it shows me that they care enough to fight against their own deeply ingrained predjudice.

It doesn't make the misgendering any better, but it does leave me hopeful that people are working to be more accepting.
Oh, I definitely get this. A lot of cis people I know are like this - they call me my name as if one day I'll decide to stop going by it. There's definitely some who aren't like that but...definitely know what you're going through. I'm sorry.
Oh definitely. I came out as nonbinary gradually over the year and I feel like most of my friends and family are just humoring me. It's honestly disheartening.
They are trying their best. But sometimes, their best still miss the mark. Unless they are trans themselves, it's really difficult to grasp the concept. Alcoholism, autism or depression are the same way. I am not saying trans is a mental health issue. Some people still think that alcoholism is a choice. Same is being trans. We are visual creatures with a lot of misconceptions in our heads. We are not required to get the whole truth in order to pass our genes to the next generation. For some people, they are only willing to do the bare minimum to go through life. Playing along is similar to doing the bare minimum. People usually don't spare the energy to focus on the issues that don't concern them personally. Especially with mind bending issues like trans. Average people don't have that kind of energy to do tons of research, uncover the truth from piles and piles of crap from the news or social media. At last, It also has something to do with ego and control.
I know exactly what you are talking about. Extended family is the worst for that! My friends have been more accepting of my transition than my own mother, and it’s hard when you hear the ‘slip ups’ that are because they only see the old you and not the real you.
Yes, it makes me feel like they see it as a joke or a phase. I’m 30 years old and just now transitioning with hormones but have slowly been socially transitioning for 7 years. I’m finally becoming happy and that’s what people are picking up on so they support me but they act as if my identity is a delicate topic when it’s just…me being myself.
Almost all of them. They learned the rhetoric, but not what it means.
Absolutely. I once saw a tweet that said ""there are some cis people that you can hear the quote marks when they call you ""she"""". And i think there is a lot of truth to that. 

I also think that we, as people who have to fight to be recognized as the gender we are, are much more anxious about slip ups meaning more than cis people are. That is, so many people will call me a man no matter what I do, and so when someone says the wrong word or does something slightly suspect, even if they would've done the same with another cis person, it rips away our security in our identity.
I'm a cis woman, and after my friend came out, I didn't see anybody else but a beautiful woman. It made sense to me, even if it was a bit of a shock at first (known her for 10 years before her transition). Since she hadn't come out publicly yet, when I saw her walking to her workplace with her old clothes, it felt so weird! Because now that I've seen her as herself, I can't picture her as a man, because she's not.

This spring, I made her choose a tunic pattern and yarn color and I made it for her. I feel like I connect way more with her as well. This morning is her first day at work as herself. I know she's very nervous about it so I texted her to let her know I'm thinking about her.

I understand that it's not a majority of cis people who can understand. Well we can't fully understand because we didn't go through it ourselves, but we can be open, educate ourselves and try to understand.


I subscribed to this subreddit because my 9 yo daughter mentioned she thinks she might be a boy. I want to accompany her if this is who she is.
If I told my friend about a problem that he had no way of understanding but he said he supported me and then asked a few dumb questions, I might get the idea that he was just humoring me no matter what the issue was.

That just means they are your friend and they are struggling to relate. It doesn't mean they aren't on your side.
It’s a real feeling. Sometimes you can hear the air quotes.

But it goes away the deeper you get into your transition.
My face almost fell to the ground when a lesbian friend called me Bro and fist bumped me in the chest (like, close to the neck)
Yes, I get this feeling that they just indulge me in my ""preference"" too. I am absolutely non passing, not even on hrt yet and won't be for some time still, masc voice, so they have hard time gendering me correctly, but I just roll with it. It's sad, but I am who I am for myself first.
It seems to me, from my personal experience, that many supportive cis people are supportive due to their underlying morality, but they're being supportive of someone who they see as a 'man living as a woman'. Their shallow understanding of gender doesn't allow them to view us as just women, men, etc... We're still our AGAB to them.
I don't worry about the ones that mis-gender me or call me by my deadname.  I worry about the ones that claim to support me and are allies, that quietly/privately do not believe I am a woman, or do not think I am worthy of being considered a woman. Their secret transphobic ways make them some of my greatest challenges to overcome.
My parents 😑
Yeah I for sure get this. I have only a few close friends who met me after I started transitioning. One guy is your stereotypical cishet construction bro and is not a part of the queer community. The difference in the way he treats me, as a woman, is shockingly different in a bunch of good ways. To him I’m a woman, to my queer friends who knew me before I came out, I’m just one of the guys.
It’s the same with family. When I come in to town, it’s like they rehearsed my name and pronouns, it feels memorized. They’re supportive, but they don’t actually view me any differently. “This is just another one of his/her quirks.”
I definitely know what you're talking about regarding cis people. I don't think they can fully help it, this is how they learned the world works their whole lives.

In my darkest moments, I feel like this, too. That calling myself a girl is merely a facade and I know it. I grew up in a cisnormative world, and my mind has trouble deconstructing this reality
In a way I feel like they have to, to an extent. I mean you can’t possibly understand being trans unless, well you’re trans. People can be sympathetic, supportive and such but they can’t really understand. Some get a bit more than others but that’s just the nature of who we are. It’s like someone who has never seen war trying to understand it.
Fortunately most of my friends are queer an i only get this feeling with my mom.
It is very frustrating
I think if you have lived 34 years of your life of people knowing you as someone else, and are only two months on hrt, people will still make mistakes. I think you need to give them more time to adjust.
For sure. I don't want to completely misplace my feelings or thoughts here. I'd take an accidental misgender and apology over outright refusal and bigotry any day. It just makes me sad that so few people understand what's really going on. I try to educate as many as I can, but I'll never fix my entire social circle.
This!

We can’t and shouldn’t expect from other people to overcome a lifetime of programming within a very short time frame. For me personally, the fact that someone *tries* would already be “good enough”, because I **know out of own experience with other topics** how difficult it is to compensate for some of those programmings.

And no, people can’t really overcome their programming (or at least the majority **can’t**), they can only try to compensate or cover it…
I feel the same as the things you are saying. I am both trans and bisexual, but sometimes even drag queens ring my alarm bells becuase of my extremely masculine cishet upbringing. I know it is wrong, and I am sure that the cus people in OP’s life know it is wrong aswell. It is just a matter of time to when their brains can make the change. I don’t mean to disparage her feelings though, but hopefully just soften the blow of their treatment a little bit.
Hey, at least they are not ""researching"" detransition stories and spam you with these. Or gaslight you constantly to make you question yourself and your feelings.
You sound like a wonderful person.  

I definitely don't want to come across as saying ""all cis people"" or anything like that. I know my wife sees me. And her sisters do, too. They know I'm a woman and I can hear it in how they talk and see it in their eyes when they look at me, despite still having some facial stubble and such. They *get* it.  

But others... You can feel the performance. And it's just really sad. I can handle it, for the most part. But there's such dissonance between what we experience and what others see.   

But you're right, when you know the person, it should be just that easy to recognize who they are. When you see them as themselves, how could you see anything else?
I'm not at all saying they're not on my side. I'll take ally-ship in whatever form it takes. I'm just saying they don't see me as a woman. They still see me as a man who felt the need to present as a woman. Even if they're using my chosen name and pronouns. It feels performative, rather than aware.
I'm optimistic that I'll pass. At only 2 months I'm already close, if you ignore the residual beard shadow. And I do think people will start to see the real me more as I transition more. But I just wish it weren't so superficial to them. I wish I could help more people understand what the reality of it all is. And hey, maybe I can make a difference. But it's still frustrating in the meantime.
I suddenly hate being called bro SO MUCH! I was fine with it pre-transition, but now it just feels so gross!
Yeah. I'm definitely complaining on a high level, I'm aware of that
I hope for you that those will see the wonderful woman that's in front of them. Maybe with some time...

Humans are naturally very reticent to change, so maybe that's a reason why it's not natural for some people. And some will just never understand or even acknowledge that it's real.

When we are in a great period of change or more difficult periods, we see who are our real close friends. 

>But you're right, when you know the person, it should be just that easy to recognize who they are. When you see them as themselves, how could you see anything else?

Exactly. It's like a mask finally fell down and the person we see is real. I don't feel or act differently with her than with my cis women friends. I couldn't. And the person I see now is literally blooming and glowing, because she's finally herself.
They are fighting however many years of prior memories of you presenting as a man. They exist in their head. They are only human.

Eventually they will have experiences with you as a woman and then they will understand how to interact with you in this new way.

You can also help build those experiences.
Omg yeah at 2 months I wasn’t even gendering myself correctly. By about 18+ months in people see you how you are. And it all gets easier after that. The first year or so is brutal tho. Fight through. You’re closer to the light at the end of the tunnel than you’ve ever been before.
Kinda reminds me of how I get dysphoric when I get called ""girly"" or ""sweetie"" .I get that older women like those phases for ladies but yet I still get called these phases when I'm ftm.
Calling each other bro is something that cis men do s lot so.
I've been treated like a girl a lot but I don't look like a girl at all. I still use men clothing and haven't done HRT and only use fem pronouns with people I trust the most. It is weird how many people acknowledge that I am not a man but aren't capable of actually treating me like a woman consciously."	x044a8	trans	274	0.97	2022-08-28 19:42:18
Today was good, first day at work where I didn’t get misgendered		"Congrats, and, I’ve just got to say, your outfit is so bold and cute! Mad respect from one bold dresser to another. May I ask where you found those pants?
First misgender-free day! That's a big day! So happy for you!
Love those pants 😍😍😍
Looking good girl!
Thanks they were from New Look not sure if they exist outside of the UK though
Thx friend! Will have to check on that."	npdmac	trans	274	1.0	2021-05-31 21:17:36
Parents told me to be thankful that they try to avoid the wrong pronouns	My parents constantly misgender me, even after a lot of talks. During the most recent talk I tried to explain to them that the misgendering is the reason that I avoid being around them and I get that it’s hard for them to change pronouns but they could at least try it. Then my dad told me that they simply don’t want to. He also told me that if a stranger would come up to him and ask him to use certain pronouns he would do it but not for me. He thinks I should be grateful that they try to avoid the wrong pronouns (what they do but the amount of times they misgender me are definitely higher) He told me it’s their choice and I should accept it. He also told me that they are more tolerant than me because they accept me as I am and even try to avoid the wrong pronouns but I don’t accept their choice to not use the right pronouns. I don’t know what to think about that so any thoughts?	"It sounds like you should continue to avoid being around them.
It's his choice, just like it's your choice to not be around them.

Gotta love the entitlement on your parent's end. If they're incapable of treating you with basic human decency, then their loss. If you desperately feel the need to be around them, stop responding when they misgender you.
At that point, I would've told my parents I wouldn't want them on my funeral. And that they'll never see their grandchildren.
All of that reads as your parent(s) saying ""we knowing and willingly dehumanize you, and that's more tolerant that advocating for the BARE minimum of respect and dignity."" I'd keep avoiding them. Do you have any friends you can stay with? Is moving out an option?
Your parents sound abusive. You said in another comment that you are afraid your dad would be physically violent towards you. How old are you? Is there an accepting relative you can live with?
This... Is very gaslighty and definitely manipulative.. I'd avoid them at all cost.
No, you definitely shouldn't accept it. Go around the house and use the wrong pronouns on *them* and see how they feel
Sounds like some bullshit
Get out of there. If underage, call CPS. If not, find a friend who will let you crash with them until you can get on your feet.
Whatever they might say about trying, it doesn't sound like they are making any effort. 

Try to spend time with them as hard as they try to treat you with dignity and respect.
i'm really sorry you're going through that, i've dealt with similar things and it's infuriating

the way i feel about my pronouns is that it's an extension of me, just like my name. if someone was going about calling me something that isn't my name that isn't ""their choice"", it's them deliberately doing something that makes me uncomfortable. which means they at the least don't respect me or outright want to cause he harm.

i would suggest putting distance between you and those that cause you intentional harm if that it at all possible. talking and trying to reason with them is of course useful but sometimes that's just too hard and you should take care of yourself

wish you the best, you're strong enough to get through this <3
> He also told me that they are more tolerant than me because they accept me as I am and even try to avoid the wrong pronouns but I don’t accept their choice to not use the right pronouns.

This is the biggest pile of steaming bullsh*t I’ve read since Biden took office.

First, “You need to tolerate my intolerance” is total crap.

Second, I can’t even parse “they accept me as I am and even try to avoid the wrong pronouns but I don’t accept their choice to not use the right pronouns”. Are they trying to avoid the wrong pronouns or choosing to not use the right ones? You can’t do both of those things. And it sounds like they’re either doing a piss-poor job of doing the first or going full-tilt asshole with the second.

There’s a better family out there for you and I hope you can kick this one to the curb soon!
So they're being shitty and transphobic, while attempting to gaslight you into thinking you're the intolerant one? You should be real grateful when you get the fuck out of there.
This is my parents and I am moving out once they stop taking my money
They clearly are not being accepting when they say that, they're just convincing themselves with that statement
I’ve always been grateful that we get to choose our friends, I continue to stay connected to the family members I would choose as a friend. The others are just a DNA 🧬 match.
The absolute contradiction in terms of ""we avoid using the wrong pronouns we just won't use the right ones"" is glaringly obvious to everyone, right? 

I mean. If you aren't using the right pronouns, then by default you are using the wrong ones, not ""avoiding using the wrong ones"", unless you're just... somehow completely dodging using third-person pronouns altogether???
My mom does something similar, if I ever try to tell her to respect my pronouns, respect my chosen name, she just straight up tells me that she doesn't think I'm trans so she'll continue to dead name or misgender me. 
When she doesn't, she always puts stress on the right name and pronouns and is like ""did u notice I used ur right name and pronouns"" 
So you're not alone! <3 you'll get away soon, maybe you can start making a plan to leave? Having a plan sometimes is helpful. I personally have a plan to leave once I'm 18, and would be happy to help you make one❤
Seems like they are just trying to make you feel bad for correcting them and them listening once and saying ""oh we are way more supportive than anyone else that actually cares about what gender you identify as""
My parents do this too. And refuse to change. A year ago, I heard someone say something that really hit for me: “you don’t need your parents validation to be valid.” So I just don’t care what pronouns they call me. My identity is valid either way. I don’t need their validation. I do maintain a relationship with them so I have a safety net if my life falls apart so I don’t end up homeless.

If they misgender me in public, most people are going to look down on them anyways.
My parents actually go back and forth even over the past 4-5 years. They go back and forth on my gender and my name. It only ever really frustrates me when they are communicating to other people ""My son..."" rather then ""My daughter..."" bothers me when they are speaking to others in a conversation related to me. But when they are talking to me I just make sure I remind them.
My mom is very similar, says she'll try to respect my pronouns and name but after several long talks she never has. Not even once. I long for the day that she calls me her son but i think ill be waiting forever. Been out to her for a year and a half now.
My dad still misgenders me and calls me my old name, he's called me Megan like 6-7 times now but I don't have a lot of options he's my boss I will need a new job eventually next year but it sucks my coworker refuses to call me Megan he doesn't think I'm a girl because I haven't had the surgery but he refers to someone he knows as a he when he told me she transitioned (he called her a he) I wish I could just leave but I need to pay my bills and I make like $5 more than min wage now so I'm just trying to get through. I'm trying to not respond to them when they call me my old name.

I know people who knew me as my old name most people make an effort to call me Megan but some people are just rude and disrespectful
That's called gaslighting: they're trying to make you think they're being good enough but at the same time telling you they don't care as much. I think you could tell them how hurtful it is being misgendered, but tbh I don't think ""hitting back"" would be appropriate if it could put you in a position where it might be dangerous in some way. Because you could easily misgender them on purpose when they do it to you, but it doesn't sound as a good option considering the former situation.
Call them by the wrong pronoms, that should make them react pretty quickly
There’s always the consistently misgender them back option.
That’s what I am trying to do, but the won’t accept that and always stress about how I should participate more in the family life.
If I would do that my dad would just start deadnaming me again.
Kinda, I‘m looking for a way to move out, but I don’t wanna completely ruin our relationship yet
I am 17. No not really, there are friends I could live with though.
Thanks for your help, I am definitely working on a plan to move out once I am 18, and I have a lot of people that would help me to try and get out of there now.
I'd suggest, each time- explain that their specific actions leave make you feel sad/scared/alone and the participation they're asking for is harmful to your well-being. You don't have to ""convince"" them or even entertain arguments. Just tell them your feelings.

You can set and enforce boundaries, and you \_should\_ to protect yourself from harm.
Close the door in their faces if you aren't living with them and don't need them for anything. 

If they won't respect your identity tell them they can talk to a blank wall
Focus on your school and career options and leave when you can.  Try to avoid making yourself homeless.  And just ask them to call you by your name if they can't figure out your pronouns.  But again get on your feet and away from their issues.
*lifts wing* get in. I’m your mom now. Let’s show em how much more you like the family life with better family.
If it's not unsafe for you to do so, I suggest telling them plainly that if they want you to participate more in the family life, the cost of that is that they will need to start using your correct pronouns. That their options are either to make the effort to start gendering you correctly, or accept that the consequence of their refusal is that you won't want to spend time with them.
Well, he's already doing that, just not to the degree he would be if you weren't standing up for yourself. Just ignoring him everytime he does it would make him start correcting himself if he truly cares about you. If you *have* to say something, you could say something like ""who are you talking to? There's nobody named (deadname) here? Are you talking to ghosts or something?""
That's amazing! For me, it really helper knowing I could get out. Knowing I will get out
Yeah problem is I am living with them. I tried to find my own place, but my dad told me he won’t sign a rental agreement and I don’t have a chance to move out as he wouldn’t allow it.
I did that, but every time they talk the end up manipulating me so I think I am the bad person somehow so now I just try to avoid these kind of conversations.
Yeah you are right, but I guess if I would do that he would totally freak out, probably to the point of physical violence.
Are you not allowed to have a job
It’s best to avoid people who only engage in bad faith and manipulate you, yeah.
Ok then that is beyond transphobia. If you're unable to stand up for yourself without putting yourself at physical risk, then you should cut contact, or at least put him as far away from you as you can manage.
I do have a job but I can’t rent an apartment here if I am not over 18, I need to be of legal age to sign the rental agreement.
I hope you can get away soon darlin, and either teach them to behave civilized or lose access to their child.
Thank you, I hope so too"	qq6me2	trans	273	1.0	2021-11-09 15:53:30
I wish I wasn't trans	"People always tell me that being trans is ""so cool,"" but what exactly is so great about it?

My brother, who I desperately want to think of as the same brother I had a year ago, refuses to use my name and pronouns ""because he's known me as my deadname and she/her all my life.""

At school, I have to explain every time that my name is Kai, not my deadname. The most frustrating parts of this is that Kai is on my school ID, just in parenthesis after my deadname, and people still call me she, despite me looking masc/androgynous and having a masc name.

Every time I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm looking at a stranger. I can't shower unless it's in the dark. We were on vacation the last 2 weeks, and I only showered 3 times. I was outside walking around most of every day, but I couldn't bring myself to shower.

Cishet people don't understand how much it fucking hurts to live a lie. To feel like your body isn't yours. To be judged. To be harasssed. To be misgendered. To be deadnamed. 

Fortunately, I've never faced any real violence because of my identity. But plenty of kids at school have called attention to it, and every time I use a public bathroom I wait to be punched. I expect it to happen."	"This, being trans isn't cute or fun, it's fucking torture
*fucking all of this*
This ☝️

My sister once told me ""It must be really nice not having menstrual cycles (cause I was on my period; just no blood) and I guess I was just crazy hormonal cause I snapped out ""Oh yeah I love hating my body""
I hate it too. But it is who I am, so I have to fucking live with it and make the best out of it
This. I fucking hate being trans. It’s not fun when you know there are plenty of people that want you dead.
I hate it too. I’m 2 years into hrt and have had almost no results. I’ll never see the woman i so desperately wanted to be and that’s just too heartbreaking a loss to live with so that’s why I’m gonna just off myself. Just because someone comes out as trans and starts hrt and begins to transition does not mean you’ll going to get your happy ending
same here, everyone thinks beimg trans is some funny trait which comes with fun but my whole experience is horrible torture, wish i was just born a cis girl fr
I've got to concur. I tell my wife all the time that this sucks, people suck, I wish I could just ""be normal"" -_- most of my discomfort come from the opposite gender and the judgemental looks/laughs I get. It helps I started at 200 lbs and have a fair bit of muscle still so most people are too intimidated to say anything. But I'll find myself changing my clothes and taking down my hair just to avoid the ridicule. Everyday it gets a little easier though when you accept yourself and you get those good feelings. If people could just myob then transitioning and experiencing gender euphoria in public wouldn't hurt us so much.
Throughout history people have picked on, bullied conquered anyone who they thought was different. They looked at themselves as the perfect ones. There are billions of people in the world THEY are ALL different. And some day people may wake up to the facts that if you do no harm to others you are a good human. Being trans isn’t a choice it is who you are, others reactions are the problem. You are a valid m deserving human being. Be honest and true to yourself ❤️❤️❤️
Any time someone talks about how people are Trans for attention, this is what I say. Because who would choose this? 

Who would choose the hatred, the threats, the insults?

Who would choose to look in the mirror and hate themselves for facial and body hair, or lack thereof? For things other people wouldn't even notice?

Who would choose the terrifying ordeal of finally coming to terms with your identity after your developmental years, and fearing that no amount of therapy or hormones will help you?

Who would choose the potential of losing friends and family if you're brave enough to be yourself, but they're too cowardly to accept change?

No part of this is a fun experience. Absolutely fucking none of it. 

If your problem with trans people comes in when you see someone who's *finally* happy with themselves, and you sneer and scoff and think to yourself how they're just doing it for attention, or how you wish it wasn't a thing...

Who the **fuck** would choose to live on the opposite end of a world full of people like *you?*
Yep, pretty great like, being totally unable to talk to anyone about how I really feel, some of my friends saying I'm just trying to get attention, and thinking it'd be less painful to burn to death in a fire than have to keep going through this.

I wish I wasn't this way, either.
Hey Kai, this won't be like this forever, mate. Things get better as you get older and move on from school and all this dumb shit. You'll get T and you'll feel better and you'll pass and people won't sweat you about your deadname anymore. Life is so much more than it is today. I really hate being trans too, man, but you hang in there and keep your head up. Life will improve if you keep moving ahead.
being trans is not cool, it’s not fun, it’s just the way we are and we have to deal with society judging us.
I cried while reading this. I am so sorry that you have gone through so much. I’ve experienced similar feelings and I’m a trans woman. It’s so hard and I understand the pain. 

Please remember that you are loved and valid always. 💖
This is true. All of it. It's not fun, it's torture.

But some words of wisdom from one Captain Sisko
""That might be the most important thing to understand about Humans. It's the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions.""

When I rewatch Emissary this quote makes me believe that humans are capable of empathy, and shows that we are always trying to better ourselves despite our tendencies to self destruct. Gives me hope
Being transgender is not a choice. I live my life the best way I can with what I have. I have chosen to transition and live my life as my most authentic self. Doing otherwise would personally be a lie. I can't live that way and still love myself. Do I wish that I wasn't transgender, sure. I am transgender so I deal with that aspect of my life and try to minimize any problems that come my way because of it.

You got this Kai. It should get easier the longer you transition. People treating a fine gentleman like you poorly for being transgender is unacceptable. I hope that you will be able to navigate these turbulent times well until things get better for you.
I think most of us wish we weren't trans. But that's not the hand we were dealt, v so you need to make the best of it. 

My goal is to feel normal, and I'm starting to really get there. It takes time though.
I get this a lot people are so ignorant abt things like this I’m sorry you have to deal with this king
It sure is hard and I agree with like 90% of the stuff said here but the thing that lets me say it's nice to be trans is mostly because of the amazing people i have met within the local queer community, the thing that i have something in common with those ppl. That we can relate to the same stuff and ofc Sometimes the same struggles . Yes it would probably be easier if we're all born in the body we wanted but i feel like i would miss the people in my life i like to surround myself with, Wich if i didn't had i probably would be dead by now cis or not.


Completely understand if u don't agree but wanted to share something different then ""same""
Yeah I've definitely been there. It's not an ideal thing and lots of people won't understand it. But it is something that will make you feel way better when you embrace all of yourself. I definitely cried for wanting to just be normal and not having to deal with it. But it really proves that we don't choose this for ourselves. It's just our truth. I can promise you that it doesn't go away, but it gets way better and you'll be much happier for having it be part of who you are then trying to hide it.
I know that feeling, my advice is just to ignore those horrid people and work towards HRT, once you do that you should be able to shower easier and maybe people will take you more seriously. They shouldn't need you to get hormones to take you seriously but there's not much else I can offer in the way of advice sadly. Personally I can't shower if I need to look down but I've got small a cups forming so my chest isn't so bad.
Politely tell high up at school to try to get ID card reprinted without your deadname.
Body disphoria is fun 😳🔥

If you are outside the US, you can find resources at [Open Counseling](https://blog.opencounseling.com/suicide-hotlines/)
My mom is getting better and more understanding, but when I first came out, she asked if I was doing it for attention and to be different. Because I would *choose* to be discriminated against. Like every other kid, I just want to live my life in fear of being called a slur or wondering ""Will this person hurt me if I tell them I'm not a girl?""
That doesn't mean that there are no people who are doing this for attention. Yes, there are. However, I don't believe that anyone would actually *medically transition* just for attention. That would make no sense.
I felt like shit tbh. They're trans too (just not in the binary way) and generally they don't have any kind of dysphoria; more like gender just doesn't quite fit them, so they really do not understand what a miserable feeling it is
Not sure I like the what-aboutism here. 

Or the implications you're putting forward about the validity of those who decide that medical transition isn't a part of their journey.
I've thought a bit about your response and what I had written. My intention wasn't to invalidate anyone, yet I see that these beliefs can actually invalidate people and make them doubt more. I was thinking about people like that ""trans Korean guy"" whose name I've forgotten, but ... that's not being trans.

Thank you for your response. I see that I still need to change some of my beliefs, internalised transphobia perhaps. Might also be a reason why I find it so hard to accept myself. Have a nice day ❤️"	vdh9mg	trans	270	0.99	2022-06-16 08:38:19
how can I pass as more masculine? Im non-binary transmasc and am constantly getting misgendered. I want people to see me as a boy instead of a girl but I don’t know where to start. Any tips would be greatly appreciated :)-moth		"To be fair...your face looks like a young male.

It maybe your hair style. But dont change it if you like it!
It looks cool.
  A short crew cut style hair cut and working out within reason always helps people look more masc
[deleted]
You do look wonderfully non-binary. Perhaps, lose the colour and work on muscle, also more masculine clothing. In the end, always be the best version of you that you can be 🫂
Lift weights? Upper body muscle mass almost ALWAYS reads masc.   


Pushups, chair dips, bicep curls, lateral bar pull-down. Youtube has TONS of good help for workouts at home, gym help, muscle building, etc. Maybe start doing track and field as a way to get active? :)
You should look into masculinizing makeup. Basically, it involves using shading and colors to change the contours of your face. I've seen it do some pretty impressive things and while it looks difficult, I'm sure with practice you could be quite good. Best of all, because it's makeup, you can take it as far as you want so you don't need to go for a 100% male image if you don't want to. I'll try to find a video of it I've seen.
To me it’s pretty hard to tell just from looks if you’re a boy or a girl. Perhaps it is the voice? With what other people were saying, building muscle will probably help you pass as masculine. Though I think you look fine, it really is hard to tell. If the people misgendering you hear your voice before misgendering you, then I think that may be it, though I don’t know what you sound like.
sometimes when i wanna look more masc i do a lil bit of contouring. here's one video that helped me: https://youtu.be/ueq8hkCMS34 

and if you just youtube ""masculine makeup"" you'll find a lot of other stuff
To my eyes you look like a cis boy but that’s just me! 

In addition to the other advice, consider just adding push-ups and pull-ups to your routine - the dumbbells will be good too, but your base muscle tone coming through your arms and back muscles really makes a big difference. A nice core is gender neutral, though, imho!
You look really nice and you have a very androgynous face. Unfortunately I think voice is prolly the single most important factor to passing, people who may be on the fence about what gender you are may end up gendering you based on your voice (but idk cuz idk you). Assuming you’re not on T it may help you to watch voice training videos on YouTube. If you want to present more masculine it may serve you to dye the other half of your hair a natural colour because coloured hair is more uncommon with cis men (it looks really cool as is though so don’t feel pressured to change it)
I recommend working out and wearing baggy clothing though the clothing is optional 

Also sick hair
Sharp cut unfitted clothing often reads as more masc, and so do heavier fabrics. I think that if the sides of your hair were trimmed a bit it would look a bit more masc? Idk thats all I got
HOLY CRIPPLES! 
I LOVE your hair!!!
Dude idk. You seem really masc to me.
Your face is androgynous enough that I think it comes down to a fashion argument.  The most obvious thing to start with is hair since yours is longer than usual for men.  Having said that, I would *personally* hesitate to cut my hair since that's the sort of thing you can't exactly change on a whim.  Instead, I would suggest pinning or tying your hair back so that it is distinctly kept out of your eyes.  I'd do this with an eye to function more than form.

The second thing is your shirt.  A tank top is commonly worn by every gender and as such makes no argument about how you wish to be seen.  A generic t-shirt, men's polo, or men's button up would make a stronger case.  You could also work out and focus on adding muscle mass to your shoulders.  This would give a more stereotypical masculine build. Given even some reasonably-defined muscles in the arm - you don't need to go for steroid-enhanced gym rat or anything - a tank's gender-neutral nature becomes more decisively masculine.
Masculine is a social construct a long time ago having long hair would've been considered masculine similar to cavemen having long hair and the color pink used to be considered manly and heels were made for men originally. So let me tell you what dress however makes feels masculine because you are valid.
So you want society to perceive you as masculine, eh? Well let me give you some advice on how to do that.

Suppress your emotions and vent them by abusing and oppressing marginalized groups. Solve all problems through violence. Ignore intellectual pursuits, instead aiming for increase in physical strength. But don't let that keep you from acting smarter than everyone else. Consume materials that will accelerate your race towards death. Exclusively drive vehicles that cause extreme atmospheric and audible pollution, so everyone within miles will know you're coming just from the smell and noise. Bonus points if you constantly yell and smell like literal shit so you don't need the truck to smell and yell for you.

Sorry, I just felt the need to rant about toxic masculinity and the ways it ultimately hurts men and women alike. But if you want us to perceive you as masculine, well... it's a lot simpler.

Just do what makes you comfortable. Wear the clothes you like in the way you like. Don't pressure yourself to change beyond what makes you feel comfortable about yourself. Don't let the transphobes and generally rude people out there get to you. You're as masculine as you want to be, already. You can change your external appearance, but that doesn't change that on the inside, you're a ferocious lion.
Rub some dirt and engine oil on your face and arms, and go talk about engines and tanks to really show the manliness, seriously tho I would say try to work out, get more buff and usually that looks pretty masculine
You can try taking Testosterone. You could also cut your hair. You can also use blue. You have to act like a boy, it can start off doing it so people can't tell like what I did and look at masculine shows and learn how to act like a man from there. You can also practice mewing. You could try looking subcultures like Punk or Metal and probably wear Metal shirts. You might not want to make the mistake of acting like a bully like I did, doing something similar but it starts off that way. You can also make yourself feel like a man like I was told and that's how you act masculine, be careful though because aggression (which is dominance) is made up of anticipation and anger so don't push the anger too far, and you shouldn't one up a bigger man than you, being dominance, and physically bigger. You would also be expected to be dominant but don't be full on aggressive and get into fights, just be the bigger man and walk away and that's how you be popular. You can also wear ball caps but probably don't do it like Ash from Pokemon, it'll just be to hide your hair. You can also wear hoodies so people would think you're boy and just a teenager. You can also surround yourself with boys and girls (if you feel like you've been too masculine).

Those are all of my ideas... Btw dying your hair is very feminine and blue isn't enough because that's something a masculine girl would be expected to do because they're masculine but still a girl but if you actually want to transition and be treated like a boy, it would probably be a good idea to make it so people can't tell but it might be too much all once so don't it all at once like I did because my mum is still yet to come around and we're just not talking right now

For me it helped a little wearing a mask even when not required so people at least couldn't figure out my gender and weren't surprised if they were wrong. And obviously baggy clothes and stuff :)
Trim the hair down, enough that it isnt so fluff, more controlled would help. Then, the color doesnt help, I know alot of people like colored hair, but to me it's always has been a giant identifier for LGBT peeps. Then cloths, a collard shirt, even untucked over a Tee works great. Lastly scowl more, your face is too soft/nuetral, most mens faces have a natural tightness to them, especially in the eye brows. Most of a man's facial expression is in the brow, for women it's in the cheeks and lips.   

I would also recommend to be more assertive in tones and mannerisms, watch some movies with manly men, either old jhon Wayne movies or newer story driven(wolf of wallstreet is a good example). Pay attention to the walk, hand movements, how they move their face when they talk. As for speech mannerisms, just watch other people and brake down each little detail.
Honestly thought you were a cis man
You look like a handsome young man too me, you passing as masculine will probably always make you look way younger. I got a basic recommendation, Try a larger shirt and then your size and tuck just the front into your pants if you don’t use/have a binder and have the need to lower chest size. It might not work for everyone but it’s worked for me and I’ve seen other young men using this method!

Hair is great bro, you look like one the nice skater dudes I used to hang out with.
r/transvoice
Probably just your hair tbh. A shorter style
Facially you seem alright to me - as a very young guy. 

If your voice is giving you away, there is a good sticky at the top of this sub [https://www.reddit.com/r/TestosteroneKickoff/](https://www.reddit.com/r/TestosteroneKickoff/)

Your hair is bad ass, don't go cutting that. Though, I would let the colour fade out.
Rectangular glasses, it always works
I scrolled through the comments, it looks that a lot of folks (me included) think you look like a younger guy, so in addition to the comments about working out, I'd say it's likely your voice causing some misgendering, so maybe consider some voice training?
Fuck, it’s summer. Maybe hoodies or sleeveless hoodies. (This is referring to appearance and wardrobe, as superficial as it sounds, could help). You look good. Wear what you’re comfortable wearing, don’t be too afraid to correct people even if it’s terrifying to.
if you are comfortable using a tiny amount of makeup there are some awesome guides out there where to add what to give the impression of a more masculine jawline, saggier eyes or stuff like that☺️
but i wouldn't try to overdo it (idk how old you are) since most of these are traits that appear post puberty/later in life (tho none of them are solely appearing on 100% Testosterone bodys either etc.)

you also already look like a boy who's just started to hit the first steps of puberty (i hope i'm not insulting or invalidating) 

sending hugs dude🥰
I personally kept my natural hair color. Of course cis teen boys do color their hair, but it’s mainly common colors like blonde streaks or something like that. You pass really well though
Many cis boys have you're hair style it looks masculine expect the hair dye no offense.
Oh really? That’s wonderful to hear actually! I am planning on getting a trim soon to take off some of the length. I do really like the current style I have though. I mainly just want to shorten the sides and back, hopefully that helps with the masculinization. Thank you for your input!
His hairstyle looks boyish too.
bro please don’t cut ur hair. but working out i agree with
yeah, that makes sense. I do aerial silks at least 2 times a week and that requires a lot of arm/core/leg strength. It’ll probably take longer to build visible muscle with just aerial, but I could definitely try some other work out things when I’m not doing silks. Thank you for the advice!
I do aerial silks at least 2 times a week(almost always a bit everyday) and that takes a lot of strength. But I will definitely look into other ways I can build muscle when I’m not doing aerial. Thank you for the advice!
Try one of these, in varying levels of subtlety.

THat was a quick google search, I've seen a really good one on TikTok but I cant find it.
Thank you! yeah my voice is a pretty heavy giveaway that I’m not a cis dude. I’m working on trying to deepen it as best as I can though. Once I’m tired of my current hair color(which i know will happen eventually) I’ll definitely look into more natural colors. Thank you for your input!
His hair style looks masculine already except the hair dye.
Like for real you look like a friend of mine who had poofy curly hair back in highschool many moons ago.
Trimming the sides and back is the right move for sure.
After the trim, your hair will look just like my father's did when he was young (except the blue of course)
Why not...?
[deleted]
I’ll definitely look into these! Thank you!
One thing I've found very helpful as far as voice deepening goes without T is learning to sing properly with a ""chest voice."" If you don't really sing that probably doesn't make sense, but it's sort of pushing sound out from your chest rather than your throat. It's hard to get in the habit of just with talking but like singing/belting and stuff works.

 I've been doing a lot more vocal training (musical) over the past year or so and it's made my speaking voice sound quite a bit deeper/richer and given it a lot more power that I think is helping me sound more like a young cis guy than a girl.
because its so *chefs kiss*
I have some that I can use already, I just never do! Hopefully I can get the motivation to actually use them! Thanks again!
Agreed. Plus I feel like the style here is already pretty masculine as far as medium-length hair goes.
It is pretty great, but I think OP should at least consider if they want to change it if they're not satisfied with it.
My #1 tip on this is that muscles are made in the kitchen! You can lift a ton but never see great results if you don't also eat a ton!  

Try to eat .07-1 gram of protein per lb of bodyweight (protein powder helps) and especially make sure to eat enough on the days you work out. You'll notice changes pretty quickly if you increase protein intake!
ofc its up to op, but someone said cut ur hair to pass. I just meant don’t cut ur hair if ur happy with it just to pass its not worth it.

I wasn’t misgendered by guests today! 😊	Today at work I was doing what I usually do, but then I heard someone say “excuse me miss” then I look around a little and realized she was referring to me!!! Then when I was wiping down a table a mom said to her kid “don’t sit down yet, let her finish wiping the table” the fact that I pass in the eyes of others, even without long hair is truly so euphoric. Even though today was a 9hr shift I loved every second of it 🥺😊	"thats awesome im so happy for you
Transition goal attained! 😊
🥰
I'm really happy for you! It's always nice to have something like that happen, especially on a 9 hour shift!

Also, cause of this post, I learned the Andy's Apple Farm dev is trans and I honestly think that's really cool. I hope you keep kicking ass with your games!
I'm happy for you, congrats!!"	sryu5p	trans	263	0.99	2022-02-14 01:53:03
Trying to regain my courage to go out and do my daily hustle after being misgendered by the makeup girl at Target yesterday. Ish always makes me feel ugly & depressed :(		"Doesn't help that I ""accidentally"" drank way more wine than I planned to. Every day I get anxiety thinking about how many people will address me using male pronouns or how obvious it's going to be and how non passing I'm going to feel when they use NB pronouns. I feel like I make it pretty obvious what I'm going for but maybe I'm just not feminine enough?

I feel depressed and I just want to stay inside and smoke all my weed but then I'll be even more broke and have no weed. Tsk, tsk... being poor fucking sucks.

If maybe I could push some decent code for once in my adult programmer life, maybe I could just stay inside and maybe I could afford to get my nails done or make some progress in my appearance. Ugh.. sorry just had to vent this somewhere..
You went to Target dressed like this and still got misgendered? Fuck, why do people not think? Even if she thinks that you don’t pass (I think that you do!), she shouldn’t misgender a female presenting person on purpose, that’s just plain malice. 
I’m so sorry it happened to you. You have an amazing sense of style.
You are beautiful.  Don't worry about what some random chick at target says.
Oof! That sucks. For what it’s worth you look like a totally bad ass chick! I’m proud of you for keeping it up even when you’re depressed and dysphoria hits. It’s not easy. 

I think a lot of people assume “they” is safe or universal so thanks for sharing.
Nothing about you is masculine.  You are a beautiful woman and that lady should never have said that to you. She might not have known u were actually trans if she thought you were a very convincing cross dresser or something then maybe thats why she made the mistake but I promise you you are BEAUTIFUL.
Youre gorgeous!
The lady at Target needs glasses.  Badly.
i known it’s harder to say than to actually do, however YOU know in YOUR heart what you are, don’t let other peoples opinions or mistakes make you feel any less than what you are. you’re honestly gorgeous and you have a very “fierce” look to you. the outfit really is a vibe 💓💓 stay strong hun!!
You are totally fine girl.  Some people have no empathy and I guess that target girl don't have it. Don't let it get you down because of such people. You are gorgeous and you know you are.
If it helps ypu any i am a 21 300ish pound guy who is a guy and one day just cause i sucked my stomach in and was wareing a tightish shirt a 30 something year women accused me of being trans just cause of my moobs the moral of this is people are fucking stupid and just ignore basic bitchs you got this girl be the best you can be
You’re a beautiful woman. Some people are just stupid, rude, and not worth our energy. Easier said than done, I know. I know several cis women who get misgendered on the reg because people have stupid stereotypes of what feminine is supposed to be. F them! You just go be your fabulous self and educate people when possible and ignore them when not.
Did you ask the Target lady if you should recommend a place for good service dogs? Because she was either very much visually impaired or mentally disadvantaged to need one.

Honestly, you look so pretty and not the least bit masculine! If you didn't go to Target dressed up as a freaking bodybuilder in a very convincing muscle suit or something, then I don't see how the heck she managed to misgender you.

Some people. Honestly. You look fantastic.

(I now have a very disconcerting vision of Dwayne Johnson with yout hairstyle stuck in my head. It's funny at first, but it refuses to leave.)
Op ur so pretty!!! People who misgender you are just Fools
You look beautiful to me, girl. I'm so sorry you got misgendered the other day. From what I've heard  told by other trans people, the best way to deal with that is to correct them and generally they apologize profusely and don't do it again.
Rockin' it girl, fuck that bitch. I hope she gets pink eye.
This is actually me today, wearing the outfit I got at Target and being all hungover and depressed. Sigh.. tbh I feel like I was dressed even more unmistakably feminine yesterday.
For what it's worth I did confront her about it and told her to use female pronouns and even took a soft jab at her along with her coworker stating how obvious my preference is.
It always takes a lot out of me to hold back my emotions and stay calm so I don't start shrieking when I head on confront this bullshit and so that way the person actually learns something. Anyways it's probably all for the better.
I took a nap and feel a lot better now. All the kind words are greatly appreciated 🥰

Thank u!
Hey, thank you for taking a moment to read through my little rant :)
I appreciate it!
Thanks :)
Hahaha!! Awesome, thanks!
You’re looking really great here, neither hungover nor depressed! And I just can’t get over the outfit. It’s so adorable. 
It’s good that you kept calm. I know how frustrating it is to have people mess up your pronouns, even when you’re so obviously presenting... I hope that she learned from that experience. It’s still weird that she didn’t give it a second thought. 
Hang in there!
I will, thanks!"	cjvyyb	trans	260	0.99	2019-07-30 18:33:17
What on earth is with the Mr Beast/Chris situation?	"I don't know what on earth is going on, but apparently they're (Chris is) trans? First I'd like to know if they have a new name and/or preferred pronouns, because I don't know what's going on, and don't want to misgender them.

I also want to know if there's any info on what happened between them and their wife and kid? I have no idea what's going on and everywhere I go is giving me bigoted misinformation or just doesn't make sense

I just want to make sure they're happy, because even if I don't know them personally, it's still nice to know they're OK"	"Basically Chris is Trans/GNC, they use any and all pronouns at the moment. 

The situation with her family is that Chris and their wife got a divorce, and transphobes are blaming it on the fact that she is trans and using all the typical things transphobs say (like claiming that they're a groomer, which has no proof at all). From what I am aware, Chris and their wife divorced on good terms.
Chris stated that he had been on hrt for 2 months
she then stated he uses any pronouns
way before this, she and her wife had split, but Chris has overall custody for their kid, tucker.

people just seem to omit these two facts for some reason

but yeah, that's what happened.
They seem to have purposely omitted claiming an actual gender identity. Just announced they're on HRT and use any pronouns.

I don't know their family situation. Didn't know who they were before this.

Either way, it seems to have brought out the absolute worst of transphobes that social media offers.
Off topic, this comment section is filled with really good examples of how to refer to people who use multiple or all pronouns
I think the overlap between mister beast and trans spaces is probably relatively small but here is a pink news article 

https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/04/07/chris-tyson-hrt-gender-mrbeast-youtube/
So far they use any pronouns. They’ve been on HRT for a while.
On a side note please do not look at the comments under any YouTube video addressing this. I have literally never seen more blatant and hateful transphobia in my life. Completely ruined my day.
Chris has posted recent photos with their son, and uses any pronouns.
i hate to see that everyone cares so much about what someone else does with their life, it's disgusting
I think about this a lot. What’s it like to be a high profile human when you are also a cracking egg coming out trans? I don’t think that’s the path I would want. I value a degree of privacy. We aren’t a community that rallies around trans celebrities either. They often make transition look easy thanks to their wealth, and it tends to grate on the tribe. We just aren’t the most pro-celebrity community and I like that. A lot. 

I don’t know Chris. Seems like a decent human though. I’m sure their transition will
Be put under microscopes by millions. I wish them well. I hope they walk a beautiful path in their life.
The controversy is their trans and of course our existence has to be a fcking debate all the time
Why can’t the transphobes just let people be happy. Like cmon. We all love them no matter who he is.(she is one of the funniest out of the gang). I also hope mr beast is supportive
Idk, I tried to defend the situation but there were so many transphobes :(
Chris tyson started Hrt. I dont think any other transition has started. The only real drama is because they used to play a “manly man” character in old videos, and the old fans see them as “tainted” by another member of the crew, Karl Jacobs. The whole 2 months on hrt was just a nail in the coffin.
someone started HRT and a bunch of crybaby ass weak little boys got pissy about it and started being terrible. It was so objectively stupid that low tier god said something right for once.
I'm happy for him
Who’s Mr beast?
I would say that is none of your business and if you really wanna be a stalker about it just look at her social media accounts were she manages what information about the topic she wants you to know.
He left his wife and ruined his child’s life
it may have something to do with bud light. honestly just ew
That and Chris to my knowledge has primary custody over Tucker, their son, which I feel like sorta shows how stupid the groomer theory is
OK, good to know! People made it seem much more drastic than it seems it is, so I'm glad they're ok!

If that's all that happened, I'm surprised people are getting this worked up

Actually, not really lol
Yes! I love how people here are just casually using their pronouns, like it’s not a big deal! If this were any other subreddit, it would just be fighting over it.
it does? I use all pronouns but I feel confused if people are switching between pronouns mid-sentence and/or between sentences. Admittedly I don't really know who these people are, so that makes it harder to follow

I feel like even if someone uses any/all, for consistency it's better to choose one and stick to it. No?
That's mainly why I came here. People are so fucking blinded by being hateful because of youtube shorts and subreddits making an echo chamber for that stuff. 

Literally can't have normal conversations about these things anymore. It's just people knowingly and uncaringly saying misinformation

A bit after I posted this, I found someone who wrote over 2000 words in a comment about how Chris is wrong for being Trans, just abysmal stuff
A little ironic sense I asked the question, (then again people made sound like he killed someone /s) but I agree. So many subs are getting so worked up on something that doesn't matter much if at all
Let's not pretend it's just Chris. He has a child. There is some valid criticism to be made.
A big youtuber whose spiel revolves around basically  reinventing the game show with prizes and occasionally doing charity.
No need to be rude. This person saw a huge issue in the current media and instead of just parroting what they say on the news and Twitter, they asked a question towards people that are actually a subject of said issue.

Edit:spelling
I never wanted to be a stalker..? I was just trying to ask a level-headed community about a situation plagued with misinformation

There are parts that are obviously not my business, but clearly, this was public information if posts relating to these exact things were everywhere

Also, I feel like looking at everything they've posted in like the last month is closer to stalking than asking a single question on reddit
no need to be so impolite
Nope xe has custody over the kid and the wife left xem.
Oh naw you're a lurker. You gotta GOOO
When on earth did she 'ruin' his child's life?
?

No that's Dylan Mulvayney
no it doesnt thats someone completely different.
comrade what are you doing here
you in the wrong part of town
The very concept of bud light is disgusting. I am hardly one to condemn another for bad taste -- but one can only so far. With the widespread availability of things that taste good, like wine, or microbrews if you like that kind if thing -- oh dear I am afraid this is a lost cause
yeah it's really stupid, only two things really happened and it was the fact he said he's been on hrt for 2 months (omitted a gender identity on purpose) and said they use any pronouns.

anything else people say just aren't true or happened months/years ago
I use any/all but you have to remain consistent throughout an interaction. 

I use any/all more because I'm indifferent towards pronouns than anything so I much prefer it if it isn't a pain to follow in a conversation.
As a writer, this bothers me sometimes. I like the idea of just asking someone what they prefer on a given day, and if you don't know, just default to ""they"". To me, that feels more like respecting their identity, as they may not feel quite like a ""he"" or a ""she"" or a ""ze"", et cetera, at any given time. Of course, they may not feel like a ""they"" either, or they may feel like all of them at once, so...perhaps it's more a matter of developing our language to be more inclusive? I honestly don't know how I would write an any/all character in a story. Sounds like a fun challenge, tho. 🤷‍♀️ That said, in the meantime, it is a nice gesture to see people in comments refer to any/all folks as literally any/all.
No I was also thinking this. I was struggling with some of these sentences that referred to them with all three pronouns in one sentence. It felt like a bit of a mismatch. Even interchanging within a paragraph feels more reasonable because the former was very confusing.
I literally can’t even begin to comprehend people’s hatred of us. How the fuck can people be this way.
oh yes that's what i'm saying, sorry for the confusion <3

i just meant i've seen so much hateful things says to her and it just baffles me cause this is just someone being happy and who they are but people still wanna be hateful for no reason :(
Not really.

Parental gender has been clinically proven to have no impact on the wellness of a child.

What DOES have an impact on the kid is their parents being clinically depressed.
and she still sees the kid-
Yea now the child doesn’t have a complete family. Why born a child if you’re gonna do this?
Sweetheart, who?
When you become wise and middle aged like me, it is entirely possible that you will mentally categorize all such things as the same. Beast. Bud Light. Some thing.
Oh no. Are you going to burn a cross at me?
Again , not who we're talking about nobody is saying they like bud light here to begin with it just comes across like a needless rant
same for me. I use any/all but switching between them mid-conversation - especially without it being clear who is being talked about - just creates confusion
I see what you mean and honestly I have nothing against it except I found this comment section confusing because I had to figure out that they use any/all while reading different pronouns in a single comment or even sentence

if you want to take the challenge on, then I think you have to make sure context makes it clear who is being spoken about if you want to mix up the pronouns like that

like, in some situations you can be saying ""she did X and then he did Y"" and it will be obvious you are speaking about the same person, but in another it will be confusing af

as an any/all enby it's more like I don't feel misgendered if referred to as a ""he"" or ""she"", though ""they"" is preferable. I think that's slightly different from what is being talked about here tho
We literally are fighting so that we don't have to constantly bring up Trans stuff, and if that's what pisses them off, why do they stop us?

They're literally fighting themselves at this point
And by this point, I mean always
well accthully bible says 🤓
You can't just say that without evidence. Fatherless children have been proven time and time again to more likely to show sociopathic traits, drop out of school, commit crime, go to jail, become drug addicted etc. Chris better find a boyfriend soon.
So first of all you acknowledge they didn't leave ? 

Second of all : what you expect trans people to get castrated and foresake any right to be a parent ? For what ?
I don't think they planned on having a divorce when the child was born if I'm being honest
That former musical actress whose big on tiktok woth the 'days of girlhood' thing.
you're not that smart are you?
Somebody is buying that stuff!
Whoa, you're starting to get a bit problematic there.

Children with one parent have worse mental health, yes. So do children from broken marriages. You're conflating this with cause and effect.

We already went over this with the ""gay adoption"" stuff decades ago. There is no benefit to any specific type of family over another; just the amount of love and acceptance received from the parents.

Also, you can grow up fine with a single parent
There's no reason that you'd have to have two
This is not a case of 2 parents, this is a case of a single mother raising a child. Chris got full custody. I stand by what I said
So?

Are you legitimately arguing that you should stay in unhappy marriages? That's literally proven to be even worse for the child.
No I'm saying shouldn't have gotten custody in the first place and that it's extremely selfish for him to have even tried to. The kid would be much better off with the mom, out of the public spotlight and not with a depressed parent that's trying to figure out who they are. Chris is in no state to be a parent. They literally said themselves that gender affirming care saved their life. That's obviously a good thing, but you should not be raising a child when you are feeling suicidal, especially when there's someone else that can raise the child, at least for a bit. Chris should focus on themselves and figure their life out before trying to raise a child.
Respectfully, you don't know shit about his private life.

We literally don't even know if they're even separated, let alone if he has full custody or the details behind their separation.

Besides, like I mentioned gender has no impact on parenting. You're engaging in circular reasoning and bad-faith arguments.
They are separated. For a year now. And the mom would have been perfectly capable of raising the child for the past year. My critique is not about Chris's gender identity. Not at all. In fact I didn't even mention gender in that last comment. If you can't discuss this respectfully because you've mentally labelled me as a transphobe or something I'll stop wasting my time here.


Chris should not have been actively parenting the last year. That is an absolutely ridiculous notion. I don't understand how you don't agree with this. If you are suicidal you should not be parenting. If you are suicidal you should not be parenting. This counts for everyone. Sort out your own goddamn life before you try and parent someone. What makes this especially bad is that there was a perfectly capable parent in the picture.
>They are separated. For a year now.

That's not even confirmed, though. Just speculation. Chris is very private about his life.

Which is exactly why I think it's insane to posit that you know the exact details behind their relationship, history, parenting capabilities, and child custody.

There is literally no reason to assume any of this stuff. Not to mention that that would also warrant taking children away from any parent who's had any sort of mental health issue.
>That's not even confirmed, though. Just speculation. Chris is very private about his life.


It literally is. Stop being ridiculous and focussing on the wrong things.
No, it literally isn't. All that we know is that he stopped wearing his wedding ring.

The idea that you can go from that into a full-blown conspiracy theory about how he has full custody of his kid, his ex-wife is a better parent, and that he's still suicidal is insane.

It really feels like you're just pushing for a narrative without any evidence.

Mask mandates are finally over (alas) and I’m gonna start being misgendered again	"Addendum:  Thanks for the many thoughts. I didn’t quite mean to wade into the weeds on this.  Yes, there’s very strong feels regarding masking, social responsibility, etc.  For the record, I’ve had three Moderna shots and covid twice.  I continue to wear masks in inside spaces and remain cautious at gatherings.  I loved the silver lining of being called ma’am with consistency when masking started, but I am who I am and am leery of masks becoming kind of… crutch? or something?

Love and Light, y’all"	"Just because you don't need to doesn't mean you are not allowed to.
Wear them anyway. My area quit masks about a year ago. I still wear them EVERYWHERE.
Uh, I'm going to still be wearing my mask. Why wouldn't you??
Please for the love of god keep your masks on. If BA2 takes off here (which lets face it, it probably will) you will need a mask. Reports are any contact without a mask means you'll catch it vax or no. You'll also need N95. 

(Here being US)
I'm still going to wear a mask. But covid isn't the only reason. It keeps my face warm too in these cold winter days.
Fuck it, keep wearing the mask.

What are people gonna do, stop you?
And? Im still wearing mine bruh
I feel the same :( however I like wearing my mask since it helps prevent my allergies.
Just keep wearing them :P
I'm going to keep masking up for quite some time.  I love not being worried about my facial expression so much.
I'm gonna still where my mask...dont care what others think.
I've been wearing a mask for 2 years, regardless of mandates or not. Just keep wearing one.
Reasons to wear a mask that isn't covid:   

Masks keep your face warmer.    

Masks help reduce allergy symptoms. 

Frown at ignorant cisgender people, whenever with less backlash.  

Being uncomfortable with amount of facial hair and wanting to cover stubble or the absence of facial hair.

Not being as identifiable in your daily life can keep you safer.    

**Please suggest more**
you can still wear one?
Yee Euphoria mask go BRRRRR
Between the dysphoria I get from facial hair and general mental health I’m gonna mask until im physically stopped. Crippling social anxiety almost disappears when I am masked
Even when this pandemic finally ends there is no need to stop wearing a mask. Before covid people often wore masks as a fashion statement. It was really common in the techwear (I think that’s the name) subculture
Fuck it. I still have days where I feel beard shadowy or not comfortable enough to go out without getting half as did up at least so I'm keeping the mask for as long as I want 😅
Im wearing a mask till the laser has done it's work enough so the mustache has gone, it's a fashion accessory now.
U can still wear a mask hun
I wear it regardless. It’s fits my style. Dark navy blue or all black
Just keep wearing them
Well, you can still wear a mask. Ending mandates doesn't make mask wearing illegal. If you wanna keep wearing a mask, go for it. I will be
You can still wear one. I mean, nobody's gonna *stop* you
I'm still going to wear mine
They will be back lol with how mutagenic it is, we should all be wearing masks until its been eliminated
I'll wear my mask forever, I hate my face enough
Is it weird that i think i pass better maskless? Ive always had feminine lips, and they tend to distract from my huge-ass shoulders
Covid 19 isn't over. There is still a chance you could get sick and die if you are vaccinated, or get someone else sick. Please wear a mask.
Keep wearing em lol
You can still wear one if you feel like it. It's not compulsory to *not* wear one. Do what makes you feel comfortable ^^
Wear them. Its not only to avoid viruses but also pollution. Or some allergies. Like I'm allergic to bullshit 😁
Y'all please I'm literally begging you corona isn't the flu. It's a disabling illness you can get over and over until your body gives up and just dies. There is no back to normal, there are only stubborn people who will keep maiming themselves until enough are dead they can't ingnore the rotting bodies. Please don't be one of them.
Where are you located, I'm in Ontario, we still have to wear masks
I’m still wearing my mask and acting as a mute
they are also over where I live but I keep wearing them because I don't like people seeing my face.
Not sure where you are but everyone here is still wearing them. The pandemic will never be over!
EXACTLY! You can still choose to wear one. Contrary to many beliefs, masks didn't become illegal to wear.
Honestly? Because Covid just feels inevitable. I've had all my vaccinations and I've been diligent about my mask wearing, but no one around me wears them, and that's not good. I've gotten breakthrough Covid twice.

Not trying to be controversial either. I've just never been so disillusioned or depressed about the state of America. Still plan to keep getting my boosters because I don't want to know what Covid recovery is like without them, but I only wear my mask out of politeness and respect to others at this point. I know it's better than nothing, but we should all be wearing N95's and no one can be bothered at this point. It sucks, but we all knew this was inevitable

/Vent
yeah I'm wearing KN95s constantly, my state hasn't had a mask mandate in almost a year and it's fucking disgusting. Somehow I've avoided getting COVID but yeah i'm gonna wear a mask basically for the rest of my life at this point. COVID can cause severe neurological and physical issues and i just cannot fucking deal with that
It's so frustrating, my state has been trying hard, most people mask just about everyone is vaxxed, and we are just barely on the other side of Omicron, things are starting to calm down, and the instant it's improving, they're removing all mask for in door businesses.
We're not even out of the woods, maybe we see the treeline at best, and people act like we're home free, you'd think after 2 years of playing this death game we'd be less stupid lemmings about it, but, you'd be wrong.
It's so frustrating and totally fucked. We're about to drop masks in a week here in NSW, Australia. I'm autistic so I can't wear one... And I'm overweight, T2 diabetic, asthmatic and have just found out I may have some other, fairly serious stuff going on too.

But nobody gives a shit, so if we get another wave I'm basically fucked. I'm so over it.
Same, im surprised people didn’t wear masks a long time ago at least for the winter months
Me too! I have chronic pain and it’s worse to be expected to smile through the tough days.
Covering acne for me haha
Corona is still circulating and people still suffer from Covid infections and go to hospital for it.
If you wear makeup you only have to do half your face. 

Femme folks don’t have to smile all the time to not be perceived as “bitches”.

Can match mask covers to your outfits.

If you had something pungent to eat and can’t brush at least you won’t offend others with your breath.

Get to look like a bandit if you wear a hat and sunglasses with it.
Not only in that fashian aesthetic community, mask wearing has been a common thing in asian countries such as Japan for health reasons such as avoiding colds, flus, etc..

Idk about everyone else, but since the start of the pandemic/mask wearing I haven't dealt with a cold or flu in years now, in fact... i dont think I've gotten sick once, the only times i've felt sick where when I was dealing with the side effects of the vaccines, but even those werent consistent side effects. 

The first shot kicked my ass, the second one was lighter, and the booster shot I had zero side effects.

People need to realize that mask wearing isnt just for pandemics, they're a great option at all times when going out in public.

• Trans people can find themselves getting misgendered less often (results will vary person to person)

• Protects against many illnesses from colds, flus, to covid, etc..

• Great for protecting/hiding your identity to some degree

And just a great fashion choice
In some places folks get harassed for wearing them. It’s gross to hear but it has happened.
True and based. Masks are most effective when everyone's wearing them and especially in conservative areas, no one bothers. This hyper-individualism has destroyed the US.
Thats just the type of behavior that continues to keep this pandemic going on longer and longer. Just because ""others arent wearing it"" doesn't mean it's the proper or correct thing to do, you should always wear your mask whether a mandate is in effect or not.

Even if you don't die from Covid you can have lasting health effects or even develop health conditions that you previously didn't have. 

I'm sorry if this is just completely wrong, but your behavior/rant really just makes you seem like the type of person that goes along with whatever will get you the most favor or social ""credit"" 

""Well noone around me wears masks so why should I?""

Well, if everyone around you was murdering people would you be like.. ""Well everyone around me is doing it so I guess I should too!""?

Because thats what that type of behavior and thinking comes off, I never understood the people who always deflect to ""welp others aren't doing it so I might as well join them"" like all that does is continue to allow covid to transfer between people, but it also puts other people around you in harms way.

I swear people just forget, or dont think immunocompromised people are even human cause it seems like people only care about themselves when it comes to wearing masks/getting vaccinated/following mandates.

Whether mandate is in effect or not, or whether the people around you are or arent wearing masks doesnt mean you should just join them. 

Like... You realize anti-vaxx people and the movement is growing in popularity, as well as bigotry and conspiracy theories so yeah.. no shit people arent wearing masks when large portions aka the republican party/alligned people just believe conspiracy theories willy nilly.

I'd rather continue to wear a mask to respect people, and reduce the chance of immunocompromised people and disabled people around me in my community being infected, cause idk about you but I would not be able to live with myself knowing that my choice of ""whether or not to wear a mask"" resulted in someones death, or someone having a life long health condition because they got exposed to covid because I as an individual didnt wear a mask.

Besides I quite like wearing masks not just for covid safety, but also because it allows me to hide my identity somewhat while out in public, and it makes it harder for people to realize im trans.. after all, all they see is a very femininely done facial makeup, with my eyes and uncovered parts of my face, and an androgynous outfit. 

Much harder for people to misgender me behind a mask, and I get to be covid safe at the same time, plus I havent been sick with the cold or flu in years now.

I'm just tired of people ""giving up"" simply because those around them have, or because they see all these conspiracy theory idiots running around unvaccinated and unmasked and just think ""welp who cares now, might as well do what they do""

Like no, you should always be considerate for your community and those around you and wear a mask, whether or not a mandate is in effect.
I'm in the same boat
Jfc sounds like my state! But yeah me and my friends never stopped wearing them and won’t.
I am in anything but a conservative state and it's still the same thing. People on both sides of the aisle just want this whole thing to be over with and I get that too. Maybe like 20-30%% of people wearing them now. I've skipped a lot of concerts over the last two years because it didn't feel like a good idea, and that is coming to an end for me too. This is just the way things are gonna go here from now on
We disagree on many things and discussing our disagreements is very clearly going to get us nowhere. We'll have to agree to disagree. I'm not going to debate this stuff for the next decade of my life. Have a good one!
In conservative areas is effectively 0% masked at this point. I bought n95s for work bc I work in a factory getting close to people all the time and yeah even though I'd say we're mostly leftist (we're union, we're in metro Detroit) and corporate ""requires"" masks we're at probably 25% correct mask usage. I'll keep wearing them at work probably even a while after the corporate mandate gets lifted, but who knows when that will happen. I think they *were*  waiting for 65% vaccination rate but we've all had it available - if my coworkers want it they should have it by now - and I know most of them are living as though the plague isn't happening and wearing a mask helps me feel like I'm doing *something*  to protect my wife back at home."	sw14af	trans	249	0.96	2022-02-19 04:11:09
Had a shitty day (wore this dress and still got misgendered lots) and I lay in bed for awhile when I got home. When I got up to go to the bathroom and looked in the mirror know what I saw? A girl. And after doing a few twirls in front of the mirror she couldn't stop smiling. Love y'all 💜		"I am sorry you live somewhere with so many blind people.

Sorry, didn't mean to post this so many times - it said that it was pending  so I just kept on trying to post it again lol :p
Omg how did you get misgendered you pass so well
You're darling sweetie!
That's so awesome! I can't wait for the day i can just look in the mirror and see a girl instead of having to use a Snapchat filter to feel pretty
All those flowers make you seem fun and girly! You’re in your chrysalis right now and one day soon you’ll wake up and spread your delicate wings! Hugs!!!
You are very beautiful and you have a great smile ❤️❤️❤️🥰 congratulations 🎉 ❤️❤️❤️Aurora ❤️❤️❤️🥰
Damn people just being mean. You look like a beautiful girl to me. #transstrong. 🌹♥️
Girl, you are definitely a girl!   😘
I am so sorry you had a rough day. If it makes you feel better I think you look fantastic. One thing I have learned over the years some people suck and they always will. Some people will never understand what is going on. Try to surround yourself with like minded friends it will help. ❤️U. Hope you feel better soon 😘
I'm sorry that people are terrible. You truly are a beautiful woman though. Stay positive and show everyone your gorgeous smile.
Always be happy of who you are,you have a beautiful smile
A very pretty girl at that. Hope you are feeling better. Have great day girl!!!!

Took me awhile to realize this was a compliment lol. 
And it’s hard sometimes but there are also a lot of people who see me for who I am. I’d like to believe that there are more enlightened people than ignorant ones and that we’re moving forward as a society. Maybe that’s just me being naive but believing that makes it easier to get through the bad days.
I took this pic from an angle that minimizes my masc features (I'm close to 6ft tall and have very broad shoulders and narrow hips) and unfortunately I can't minimize those same features in person so that probably plays a role in my getting gendered incorrectly.

[Here's a picture i took a few months ago from a less flattering angle that shows what I'm talking about.](https://i.redd.it/w22tl5hxx5r31.jpg)
Thanks for saying so 😊
You’re too sweet 😊
You’ll get there! I know how hard it is to be patient but I promise it will be worth the wait. HUGS 💕
Delicate wings? But I'm a top I.. I swear. 

Jk. Thank you so much for saying that 😊😊😊
I appreciate the validation 😊
Thank you so much 😊
And I think that I’m starting to realize/ accept that - yes there will be folks who are ignorant and mean but they don’t matter. I have people in my life who see me for the woman I am and those are the people whose opinions actually count.
Today’s a better day btw 🙂
Thank you for saying that 😊
It’s hard sometimes and the bad days still outnumber the good ones but it’s getting easier. Thanks for being a wonderful human 💕
Gosh all these compliments are making me go red 😊
Thank you so much for being the kind person you are 💜
💕
You absolutely look feminine and like a woman in both pictures imo!! You're honestly gorgeous
[removed]
Holy shit you're still absolutely adorable, you look like a beautiful woman and I hope you keep smiling💜
;)
Awwww thanks so much 💕
You’re welcome! Thanks for taking my compliment in its intended spirit 😅😁
Thank you for being you. Hope you are doing better. Looking great!!
Omg thank you 😊
You’re so kind 💕
That’s absolutely true that we need re-education. I mean I don’t think that most people go out of their way to be hurtful - like 9/10 if someone misgenders me it’s because that person is just ignorant and not trying to be an asshole. I think that teaching kids when they’re young that people come in all different shapes and sizes and that some people are assigned the wrong gender at birth is super important in combating that ignorance. 
Also thank you for your kind words 💕
That’s so nice of you to say! 
Thanks so much 😊😊"	f2ljut	trans	242	0.99	2020-02-12 04:32:21
My [17M] partner [17NB] was heavily bullied on AITA today and attempted suicide because of it. Send them some love!	"My partner posted on AITA today asking that, since their coming out a day ago, should they blow a dog whistle when their family misgenders them? They acknowledged it had only been a day, but also mentioned they had been told to their face by their mom that she insisted on misgendering my partner and denying them their preferred pronouns and also told them they were not allowed to say anything to retaliate if misgendered. They were considering a dog whistle as a very blunt and technically not verbal retaliation against blatant and purposeful misgendering. After their post which quickly blew up and got deleted was posted, they were bullied from all people of all communities, being told they needed to be physically punished, kicked out, accused of identifying for attention, bringing down the trans community, among other things. Post is below. Show them some support and solidarity. They almost hung themselves over it. Give Jade some affirmation, they need it.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vu0sla/wibta_if_i_blew_a_loud_whistle_every_time_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share](https://www.reddit.com/r/AmItheAsshole/comments/vu0sla/wibta_if_i_blew_a_loud_whistle_every_time_my/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share)"	"AITA is not a safe space. Haters gonna hate. Don't argue or try to talk sense to a drunkard or a fool, you are guaranteed to lose. Some people just want to see the world burn. Sometimes, talk amongst like-minded friends is more than enough. 

""I end the program by saying, 'You've made this day a special day, by just your being you. There's no person in the whole world like you, and I like you just the way you are.""  

Mr.Rogers
Yikes, that's a nasty comment section. Lots of people on Reddit can be really transphobic outside of lgbt spaces. Since I can't comment there, I'll do it here.

You aren't faking for attention. It's okay to want others to use your preferred pronouns. I hope that one day your family will make an attempt to change their language. There are people who love and support you, like your bf for one. Please try to remember that a bunch of Redditors don't really know who you are and the full extent of your situatioan. Keep being your beautiful NB self!
Jade's mom declaring that she's gonna purposefully misgender them is so malicious. I can't understand how some parent can have so little love for their child. 

Jade, you're loved and supported in this community <3
Hey Jade, 31 yo NB here who only came out in February.  I'm really sorry this happened to you and you don't deserve it. Maybe your family will come around or maybe they won't. It's not your responsibility to police them and you're not responsible for their shitty actions. Use your energy for things that bring you joy and euphoria since coming out is a delicate time.  If you really feel the need to respond, you can let them know (calm works best, I did not do this face to face) that they can have an estranged and sad 'daughter' who goes low contact or a happy and loved child who spends time with them.  Whatever they go with is a reflection of them and not you.  

Please be kind to yourself even when it's hard.  Even when it doesn't feel like it, there is a larger community rooting for you. Much love from your Enty (enby aunty).
You say dog whistle but it says regular whistle.
We love you. You are strong, and they are weak. We are with you in spirit always and you are always welcome when you need solace. Never let them dampen your beauty and your light, you have more grace and power inside you than they could ever know. 

I'm so sorry you've been hurt at this time. You absolutely deserve to be cared for and defended and supported. We will always love and respect you. We will always defend you.

I wish you a deep healing process and all the love you need.
It's not always our job to defend the truth. Truth is so powerful that it can easily defend itself. All we do is getting in the way of the truth when the truth is coming at them like a runaway train. Sometimes we ended up getting crashed by the truth.
Hi Jade! 

Im NB too, and I just wanna say that if your family is stating that they will be unsupportive from the start then I think there’s no point in “waiting” for them to start accepting you whenever they like

Its the right thing as your family to support you and ~try~ to use the right pronouns 

But if they’re not even willing to try then I think the whistle should be a go

If the shoe fits i guess

I hope they become more supportive with or without a whistle

Good luck and remember that you’re amazing even if they don’t support you :D

(Also, your name is super cool :o)
Deadass? AITA is usually mostly-nice when it comes to this shit. Yikes... sorry, man.
I saw that post earlier today, I can't believe someone would bully and harass another person for posting on reddit
Jade, honey. Your life is worth so much more than this. Things may look grim now but you are young. You have an entire lifetime ahead of you with folks who love and care about you. Family are the ones you choose, remember that. I'm so sorry the internet is such a harsh place. You don't deserve that.
I sent them a DM. Just cuz I don’t like sharing too much of my personal experiences for everyone to see. But I hope they can read it😊
Some of the comments there are miserable, and the their parents are certainly dickheads, but whistling at them is a sure fire way to get in hotter water. Not worth the risk imo
Your partner attempted suicide because of the AITA post? Or because of their parents?
In all honesty your partner wanted to blow a loud whistle in people's faces just for using the wrong pronouns, you can't make a post then get upset when people are honest...
Hey I’m sorry about what happened on AITA I didn’t see your post but I do frequent on their. People can be  absolute pricks and most the responses you will get on AITA are people just trying to destroy someone’s life. I hope you feel better soon( I’m sorry I don’t know how to phrase what I wanted to put for that but I’ve been where you have been) and just as a follow up you would have been perfectly within your right to blow a whistle anytime you are misgendered
I'm really sorry for what all happened, how they are being treated and having to deal with all situations involved here.  Every trans person deserves love.
Does jade have a reddit I want to send all the love
Ugh, this is why I don’t tend to post anything that isn’t in an lgbtq friendly part of Reddit. The transphobia are going to come out and attack you and mess up what should actually be a NTA vote. Think about it like this, your family is attacking you and hurting your ears by deadnaming and misgendering you. You are simply returning the favor of hurt and hearing loss by blowing the whistle at them. Though I do think you should do something that won’t also hurt your ears. Regardless… your family is crappy and if possible you should cut them out of your life as soon as you can.
It’s tough when your young, be strong. Correct them genuinely. If that’s doesn’t work, do it sternly! If that doesn’t work! Get away from them and surround yourself with positive people! Never let anyone take from you! Your life! ❤️✌️
They need a safety disclaimer telling people not to post if they’re in a vulnerable minority because the real bullying happens behind the scenes in private messages.
When discussing it with me they called it a dog whistle
The post. They have a long history of abuse by family and generally having shitty people everywhere in their lives. I’m pretty much the only real life ally they have. Due to their history, they’re very prone to suicidal ideation and tendencies, and all the bullying from queer and nonqueer people alike pushed them over the edge.
It’s not about just using the wrong pronouns, it’s doing it knowingly and deliberately and disallowing retaliation for it. Basically trying to force them to be a girl when they’re not a girl.
u/pickleclown
Definitely don't use an actual dog whistle because that will be inaudible to humans but will drive any nearby dogs crazy
I don’t mean this in a rude or mean way, but i really hope your partner is getting professional help for all of that..
Yeah but making loud noises when things don't go your way is probably the worst possible way to handle this situation, your partner is clearly a child that needs to grow up a bit.
Thank you off to give love
Their mom won’t let them, she’s incredibly abusive and controlling and the police won’t do anything because it’s not verbal
Well trauma that historically physically and verbally abusive loved ones refuse to allow to be treated will do that to a person
Seek out a school guidance counselor ASAP. I know most schools aren’t in session right now but the counselors are always there. They’ll be able to get your partner some help and resources and help them work around their mom not wanting them to see a doctor. Start making a plan to gtfo when y’all turn 18..
Sure, but that doesn't justify being a nuisance to people. We all have trauma but we aren't whistling in people's faces when they disagree with our opinions.
This heavily *heavily* depends on where you are. Counsellors may just make things worse if they're somewhere like Florida or Texas.
trans people's identity is not an opinion. trans people do not have to be kind when experiencing transphobia - especially when someone doesn't respect them or their identity.
Let me understand your comment here- You think that a trans person wanting to be respected is an opinion that can be disagreed with?

this is such a baseless argument. you can think its ""childish"" and ""immature"" but if it's what gets results why does it matter. like. your argument feels like you being like ""transphobia is bad but i draw the line at you annoying transphobes"". cmon.

"Teacher quits in tears after being told she can’t misgender trans students anymore. Laura Morris sobbed as she told the school board that she can't respect transgender students because she's ""a believer in Christ."""		"I feel so sorry.......for not being able to see her cry myself
lol good fucking riddance
Does this melodramatic loser not realize that LGBTQIA Christians exist?  

Ugh. I'm so tired of people like this. Glad she quit... kids don't need to be exposed to bigotry.
I grew up in a household that was extremely involved in a church full of people like this. I remember seeing a kid in the youth group mocked because he was homosexual. Everything that these people preach about accepting and showing love is mostly just a feel good thing for them. When faced with the unfamiliar, the different, and what they consider ""sinful"", they show their true colors. Can't people just be people? Does it really concern you that kids in this day and age are more enlightened, more knowledgeable, more educated, more connected via the internet then ever?! I'm going to put this out because I have seen extreme religious ideologies first hand in areas overseas that chop people up for their difference of views. These types of extreme ""christians"" that preach love but practice rejection, isolation, and bigotry are no better than ISIS. I'm not kidding. If you know the programming factors and see the upbringing, you would get it. She will be better suited elsewhere in life than being allowed to teach the young minds of the upcoming generation.
Don't let the door hit ya in the ass as you go teach. Sheesh......
Aw..poor pudding. No longer to force her religious views on those same vulnerable children. Good riddance.
There is nothing even in the bible about trans people ...
Why does her belief in Christ stop her from gendering students correctly? It doesn't stop her from being a bigot.
Holy crocodile tears! Someone has their republipanties in a twist over basic human decency. Asking teachers to even consider that some of the ""vulnerable constituents"" they teach are part of the LGBT community is not ""pushing an agenda,"" it's providing a safe and welcoming place for all students. I can say my religion involves spitting in people's faces, that doesn't mean it belongs in classrooms. If your religion gets in the way of providing equal and fair education to all students, you shouldn't be a teacher. Good riddance
As a someone who is starting to transition and has been Catholic all their life, she is not for Christ if she can't respect others whenever it's cis, trans, nobinary, whatever.  God and Christ loves us all and I know they love me for who I am.  His word teaches us to respect and love each other.  If this bitch can't see that, then she's is not a true follower of god
Not her saying she’s a believer of Christ and can’t respect transgender students when God is literally agender
“I can’t be a piece of shit to children anymore? Well then, I quit.”

Good. Trans kids already have it hard enough without teachers like this. 

Treating someone as an equal isn’t political. You made this political when you fought to keep treating us like dirt. Must suck that you can’t be openly bigoted anymore.
So she never uses nicknames? That’s not the given name from parents so she must be against nicknames lol. Weird how cis kids can go by what they want but not trans kids. What an awful human. Don’t use your religion as a shield to be a complete bigot.
Students will literally be safer with her doing something else down the road.  Good riddance.
I will never forget my mom sobbing saying ""I feel like I can't be a Christian"" when I asked her to acknowledge my equality and right to exist as myself. Truly wild, the bigotry is real a real foundational part of their doctrine apparently. I asked her what she thought about the denominations that accept queer people and she said sternly they weren't real Christians. *shrug*
I'd blame her Church, probably they've brainwashed her into a fanatic
Truth !
I was gonna make a quip or something but I'm just mad, like, people like this exist and I really wish they didn't
grew up w 4 nuns in my family. I don’t want to say I’m happy they’re dead but I’m glad they’re not around anymore
oh no I can't violate basic human respect anymore 😱
lmfao
F her
Christ teaches to turn turn the other cheek and love your neighbor….unless they aren’t cis-gendered? Then go ahead and completely disrespect them?

I have always said the only people I am intolerant of is those who are intolerant. I think this fits that category quite well.
This seems nuts to me - there's plenty of transphobia in the UK but it's mostly TERFs rather than Christian fundamentalism (mostly - there's a guy who parades around Durham with a picket sign and homophobic text on it regularly. At the Miners Gala one year a guy launched his pint over him, someone tried to chuck his sign into the river, and one of the brass bands played YMCA as he went past - last was a personal favourite as it was a jam), and these sorts of people don't really exist here. Is it mostly an American thing?
\*plays sad violin\*
Is this America? Like bruh...
I know, right? It's like Cartman licking the tears on South Park with that one.
You can! There's a Twitter video linked in the article.
Exactly. Her students should be better off without her espouting her fundieness onto them.
No. They believe LGBTQ+ Christians or those who affirm LGBTQ+ Christians are ""Not Real Christians"".

&#x200B;

As a church kid, I have always heard this my whole life. If you vote Democrat, you're not a real Christian. I heard that my whole life.

&#x200B;

I literally had a pastor pray for Obama for standing up in affirmation of gay marriage. As someone who came out of evangelicalism, I can attest to how cultish it really is.

&#x200B;

Check out [Girl Defined](https://youtu.be/xEjpyRjs2-s) and what they did to God is Grey.

&#x200B;

I've been hearing this stuff my whole life. I've been told I'm not a real Christian man simply for not being married and having children. Literally.

&#x200B;

Guess I'll never be a real Christian man. I'm hellbound, I guess. Jokes on them!
Of course not. Asshats like that categorically deny the existence of any Christians who aren't fundamentalist asshats.
>Does this melodramatic loser not realize that LGBTQIA Christians exist?

No true Christian ...
I grew up in churches like this as well. The truth is these same churches support the Christian right groups that funnel bills in other countries like Brunei, like Ghana, like Uganda that support death sentences for being LGBTQ+. These same groups like to think themselves as above Isis, but it's hard to not see what is different from them. It's why I call them the Y'all Qaeda, because they are so fervent about supporting dictators like Orban from Hungary that they have forgotten how to love, really. 

&#x200B;

If you want to know more about these groups, I have a segment called Hate Watching, where I talk about one of the most anti-LGBTQ+ groups in the entire world, Alliance Defending Freedom. I am going to be running a segment on each of these groups individually, because I find it's important to know who these groups are and how to stop them. You can read my ADF post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/LAMPNet/comments/oxe4zx/hatewatching_getting_to_know_the_antilgbtq_groups/).

Yup. She'll be on some Laura Ingraham segment tonight, I'm sure, talking about how the ""Trans Agenda"" has ruined her life and is coming to turn her children queer. I'm sure Abigail Shrier will be on with her to say some weird stuff about social media influencers or whatever bull she is trying to pull.
Isn't that being hypocritical? You want the school to force your views onto the kids. What's the difference?
b-but deviation from the societal norm is scawy :'((((
>Why does her belief in Christ stop her from gendering students correctly?

Because capitulation to transgenderism curses their immortal soul. And between their soul and human decency,  the is no contest.

After writing that I have to replace this phone & wash my texting fingers in something caustic. 

In short: she's a piece of shit
Her religion seems to rip the Golden Rule out of the Bible, along with every single verse about love.
She didn't mention gendering  in her resignarion at all actually.
Exactly.
Yeah, this is always such a gross contortion of religion to me. I haven't been religious most my life, but have religious family and went to a Christian preschool. The two biggest take aways for me were: not our place to judge, and we're made in gods image. Doesn't seem like god is super cis or binary themselves.
Yup.
I'm not sure what you're talking about. Obama was against Gay Marriage for most of his political career.
Yes. Some true Christians are LGBTQ+
I think u/ejectafteruse is referencing the No True Scotsman fallacy. If so, the downvotes are really not deserved.
""NO TRUE SCOTSMAN PUTS BUTTER ON HIS TOAST!"" - this teacher probably
Vanilla isis
I didn't say it was all of them. I know someone I grew up with in that church that came out about 4 years ago and everyone just ostracized him and talked crap about him. It's sad. My mother said something about it to me (not out to them yet) and I said ""good for him! He's finally living his life for him."" and her jaw dropped like she thought I was going to join in on the bullshit. I called him right after (I hadn't known yet) to say that I loved him, was in his corner, and support his decision to live his life. Love wins the day every time.
Thanks for this. I’ve never been able to figure out why folks like this are so angry and demanding. So what if someone is different? It’s the capitulation part that is so toxic. It’s not enough to believe what you believe and to live and let live. If you *capitulate* to it or allow it to exist, then the sin is yours as well. So much for the “Golden Rule”
> In short: she's a piece of shit

That's an understatement. She needs horsewhipping.
So to sum it up pretty much all of the texts which christianity was based upon
She isn't suitable to be a teacher.
??? 

> The policies address record-keeping, names and pronouns, use of gender-segregated facilities, and other topics that affect how trans students are treated at school.

That’s from the article, so she was resigning over not being able to misgender kids, along with not wanting to provide trans kids with a safe environment to learn. She was talking about the policy, so she was talking about misgendering people.
He started to change his mind when Biden started to speak up more, and in around 2014-2015, Obama started to say he was for marriage equality, standing up for Obergefell. Obama did change his mind later on. When he did, I heard everyone say ""I'm praying for Obama, that godless Muslim!"". 

&#x200B;

Yup, I sincerely heard that. 

&#x200B;

They blew gaskets when the prayer breakfast, and he stated that Christians have done evil as well, just like Islam has its terrorists too. Whoo, that did not go over well.

&#x200B;

Despite Obama always claiming he was a Christian (and Biden a Catholic), the consensus in my corner of Jesus Disneyland (as I heard a pastor call it) was that no Democrat is a Christian. Bible Belt groupthink for you. I always heard liberal Christians can't be real Christians, or as Girl Defined stated ""Why Call Yourself a Christian?"". I've heard this my whole life.
I am a Christian and I’m also in transition MtF, these people give us all Christians a bad name! Unfortunately many others think just like her… so glad she quit, she has a lot to learn
So happy she won’t be spreading her 💩 opinions to children anymore!! These kinds of teachers need to step down
I was referring to the No True Scotsman fallacy.
Don't get me wrong, it's the same thread of fascism wearing the bloody hide of whatever local faith it can use, but American fundamentalist fascism created the conditions for theirs, not the other way around. So vanilla ISIS / Yall'qaeda serve to inject Islamophobia into a genuine critique of American Christianity, and misrepresent the history and origin of the problem in the process.

In essence, it's saying a group is bad because they act like [scary foreign group], despite that first group's violence literally creating the second. Traumatized Muslims are acting like American hate groups, neither has a monopoly on hatred or violence, but the American hate groups do have a near-monopoly on global violence, precipitating much of what they don't cause directly.

Those underlying threads of fascist xenophobia must be rooted out and fought everywhere they hide, including both groups and even in our own thinking.
It wouldn't help.  She'd raise her suffering as a testament to her faith.
I’m not Christian but I completely agree. There are good Christians out there it’s sad that the shitty ones are giving you a bad rep. I don’t get it honestly. I thought Christians were supposed to “love thy neighbour” but I don’t see that happening to much nowadays
Mm. You might want to edit your comment to clarify, since people seem to be misunderstanding and downvoting you. Fwiw you have my upvote
Fair enough I see your point. I did not intend to come across as Islamophobic my apologies. 

You are correct that the American hate groups are more dangerous due to the effect they have on the political climate of the United States. 

However I contend that comparison to isis and al'qaeda are appropriate comparisons to extremist Christianisty.   In that you're dealing with an insane death cult. 

To all decent religious folk let me say blessings on you and your journey.

Any better denigrating nickname suggestions for these dumb fucks.

Trans Etiquette guide?	"Hey there!
I [19M, cis] have recently found out that one guy a few grades below me (I have an after-school activity with him) is a trans guy. 

Now, want to support them as best as I can, and as such, I would like to know what etiquette regarding being trans are. 

What things are totally okay to ask, and what topics are off limits? What small things beside the obvious ones (using correct pronouns and names, and correcting misgendering/deadnaming) that make your day?

I'm really just looking for help on how I can be the best ally there is :)


So, I have read all your comments, and those are my takeaways (together with what I know already), for anyone that finds this post in the future:


1. Use confirming language. If possible use male terms, but don't be excessive (see also 2.)

2. Use the correct pronouns, and correct midgendering/deadnaming.

3. Trans men (or women) are primarily men (or women) and not trans. Treat them as if they're men (or women) and not as if they're trans. Being transgender shouldn't be their defining characteristic."	"[deleted]
Ask about things you'd ask anyone else - interests, likes, dislikes.

Don't ask things you wouldn't ask anyone else - so sexual preferences, discussions about body parts, and transition goals are probably off limits, or it would be best to wait for him to bring these up.
Treat him how you treat the rest of the men in your life.
im a trans male too, and if theres one thing that annoys me personally, its when people use fem slang? like- 'girl/queen' or things like that. obviously, everyone's different, but nothings wrong with asking what u can say to make them comfortable around you. (anyone correct me if im wrong about anything please! C: )
Like everyone else said, treat him like a dude.
Also I suggest asking him how he wants to be referred to, in a casual manner.
If you have more specific questions feel free to dm me as I am a trans man who is married to a trans man and has many trans man friends.
Don't regard him as trans except for when he brings up being trans. We just want to be recognized as the gender we *say* we are, not a mysterious other gender that goes by the same pronouns as the assigned at birth genders.

If you want to make his day, invite him to a bro hang after school. Seriously. That would make his year.
Treat him the same way you’d treat any other dude. Don’t emphasize that he’s trans or over emphasize that he’s a valid man. Treat him the same.
I see that all important things are already said, but I want to add that words like dude, bro, man etc. are the best. Use them if you can because they feel very validating (not exessively but just like you would for a cis guy).
some of the best allies are those that just treat us like people and the same as they do with anyone else
I have two trans male coworkers who started the same day as me. All I do is use their pronouns, call them dude and stuff. One of them said to me how much it meant to him that I call him bro. Just treat them like any other guy friend. Easy enough.
Just treat him like you would any other guy
I like to approach it like this, if you would ask a cis friend the question, you're probably safe. If you want to ask them something specific to being trans, then you have to base that on the individual. You can just ask, what questions are you comfortable with regarding your trans identity?
Well first off: I think I speak for everyone here when I say we really appreciate that you actually spend time making sure you don’t say the wrong things, that’s great, I wish people were more like you

Second: just treat him like how you would treat anyone
The best things to do are thus:

1. Treat him like one of the guys. If you already generally enjoy his presence, invite him out to boy's nights, or whatever. Being included in gender-affirming activities makes trans peeps feel awesome!
2. If he came out recently, or has conservative family, or even if you just want to, take him shopping! You don't have to buy him anything, just take him clothes shopping. Take him to some of your favorite stores.
3. Treat him as if he were a cis man. Unless he brings up HRT, or other trans-related subjects, treat him like he's a cis guy. I myself get a bit of dysphoria when anyone mentions \*my\* HRT process because it mean's I'm not passing.

If you have any questions, let me know.
And this is probably obvious, but don’t ever use the t-word or make transphobic ‘jokes’. And it would be cool if you were to shut down anyone else who does. Just “dude, that’s absolutely not cool.” ought to do it.  If they whine “It’s just a joke,” a solid “Jokes are funny. You’re just being a dick.” 👍
Yes! This is the best thing to do. I missed it a lot at the beginning of the transition
I second this.
Well, since this *is* still school, and also since it's Germany, there isn't much about with girl/queen thing (and I personally don't use it anyway).

But yes I'll def do that.
Omg a trans man married to a transman!!!!!!! 🌈 That makes my heart so happy. I am a transwoman in a relationship with a transman!
yessss this^^ im fluid and i dont often get recognized for being masc, and as such i spend a lot of time with cis girl friends doing cis girl things and it’s frustrating at times. i wish i had bros"	sndwcz	trans	238	0.98	2022-02-08 07:02:24
Left a note for my Mom at midnight.	"I left a coming out note to my Mom last night detailing everything for the last 9 years. How I have been hiding, how I feel, what I have decided to call myself. I put it on her desk so it’s the first she sees when ahe awakes to get ready for work. My heart is pounding!!! I wanted to leave it earlier this afternoon so that she didn’t have to think about it at work but I just needed to tell her ASAP. I don’t know I don’t know I don’t know... somebody tell ne something comforting so I can sleep omg.

Edit: wow ok thanks everyone for the love!! I came out to everyone; my mother refuses to let anybody misgender me she is my hero. I am doing much better  and I love you all!!!❤️❤️❤️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️"	"I'm sure it will all be ok 💖

Make sure to keep us posted!
I wish you luck, OP. 
All of us are proud.

Make sure to keep us updated if you’re okay with it! I hope it turns out well.
You are brave, and u did a great thing. Everyone is proud of u!
At least she knows now, and you no longer have that burden of having to tell her. She is aware, and whether  she accepts it or not at least you were able to express your feelings, and make yourself seen! That’s great, and I’m proud of you!
Much ,love , it takes courage to do that
Omg 10 hours later. What's up? How are things?
Oh gosh, good luck. I hope your mum is in a good mood this morning.
Its going to be all right. If your mom loves you then the only thing she'll care about is for you to be happy. You're going to go to sleep and when you wake up tomorrow your mom will know. And then you'll start live life the way you want to.

And be proud of yourself it's not an easy thing to do but you did it you are amazing
You have come over one of the scariest parts pushing yourself to come out. Hopefully its easier from here! 💖🏳️‍⚧️

I'm not your mate, buddy, or fella. Misgendering sucks.		"I'll probably be downvoted, but girl, you gotta get over that shit.  I used to constantly get down whenever I got a ""dude/bro"" but then after a night of hanging out with my cousins I realized that all of my cis-female cousins *also* got the ""dude/bro"" treatment.  

Being misgendered still sucks, but I don't get offended at buddy/pal/mate/dude/bro/man anymore.  Shit, even ""Yessir!"" seems to be one that I see cis-women hit with all the time.  

Being able to roll with it now without getting upset is such a positive thing for me.

Good luck out there, girl.  You look amazing! <3
as other people said things like buddy arn't necassarily gender-specific. From the picture you seem to pass quite well so there's no chance people use these phrases to misgender you.
I do not get it. I just don't. You look great.
I’ve occasionally been mistaken for female over the phone because I have a light voice. I just laugh it off and correct them. Don’t let it get you down too much. :) you look great!
Although where I live those are usually seen as gender neutral terms it still sucks that people call you that even when it makes you uncomfortable :( I hope you know that you are beautiful!
You’re definitely a pretty girl.
if it counts for anything you’re beautiful! ive found the most people truly don’t mean anything by it when saying stuff like “dude” or “bro.” but i know intent < impact. any suggestion that you might be male is going to hurt, and im sorry you have to go through that. i hate when it happens to me.
You look amazing!
How do u get misgendered?
U pass so well
Fella, buddy and dude are gender specific in my view. There is no way I'd call you any of those. Even if your voice ""gave you away"" you are clearly a beautiful woman.

I once misgendered a lady when I was 17 working in a petrol station by not looking up when they said pump 2 please, and I said yes sir. I still feel slightly bad about it now.
Yeah, it's the worst.  I don't really get it.  You look pretty good too.  So why?  Why???
Is mate considered 'gendered' these days?

Being misgendered sucks. Sorry to hear that fellow user
""I'm not your friend, buddy!""

""I'm not your buddy, guy!""

""I'm not your guy, friend!""
I always thought dude was a gender neutral  term for  most
Alright pal. Jk ur beautiful
exactly. As the classic movie goodburger teaches us. Dude is general neutral, we're all dudes
Mhmm
Everyone can be my mate or a dude.
I definitely try to curb it around my femby/mtf friends, but I’m an Australian transplant to California so a few “mates” and “dudes” slip through. Definitely not a gendered term in either places.
Thankyou! <3  


I've had a bit of a research, chatted with folks I know, and I think I've cracked it - they're fairly gender-neutral in the US and/or Oz/NZ, whereas here in the UK, they're seen as quite gendered. Here it's really rare to hear a woman referred to as mate, buddy, or even dude.
[removed]
I've noticed this with the phrase ""you guys"". I get that a lot when I'm out with my boyfriend. I try not to let it bother me, but it still kinda does a bit. Not enough to say anything, but it puts me on guard. When a waiter/waitress says it to us, it makes me listen carefully to see if they use the phrase with other multiple-gender groups.

I've never heard anybody unironically refer to a woman as ""bro"", though.
I think it's a UK thing. I chatted a bit with the girls in the office and some local trans folks and they'd all consider them fairly gendered terms, especially if it's not being used by somebody close.  


It's not as bad as my home town, particularly among the older folks, where it's very common to refer to men as ""cock"".
Thankyou! Assholes gonna asshole, I guess? I think my voice outs me, which isn't great... as a tour guide...
why? Because its not misgendering, everyone gets called things like buddy or dude.
I'm convinced it's my voice - which is sightly worrying since that's literally my job.
No, it was never considered gendered. OP talked to some people she knows and has decided that she needs to be **O U T R A G E D** over pointless bullshit
Yeah, I figured you might be in the UK so the ""mate"" thing would definitely be different over there... didn't know about the other two!  

You look great, though, girl, just brush them haters off and live your life! :)
Yeah, I think this is definitely a regional dialect thing. All three terms are much more gendered here in the UK. You'd never refer to a woman as Bro or Man here.
>Hell I call my own sister dude/bro.

Samesies broski.  Well she's my sister in law, but she's a cool dude for sure.
Are you from the UK two or are you pointing out that it is different elsewhere
Yes, there are always going to be those people. I just do not understand why anyone wants to be an asshole especially when someone is doing their job. They just spew their shit everywhere they go, just stinking up the place. 
Bravo on being a tour guide. You have to be strong to deal with all the different people you meet.
I assumed there's more too it than that since the OP seems upset.
Oh hey, that's perfect!  Seriously, after being on hormones for almost two years, I took a new position at my company and basically worked in a call center for like a year and it really helped me work on my voice without even trying.  

When I first started I was constantly misgendered, but after a year or so it was a really rare occurrence.  I learned that it's more about the cadence and nuances of speech and not so much about a ""feminine pitch"".  What really helped me was talking to some women who had deeper voices and noticing what made *them* sound feminine and mimicking that a little bit.
Yeah, I'm in the UK.
Having chatted a bit with the (cis) girls in the office and some UK-specific trans forums, I'm fairly sure this is a regional thing. It's clear the prevailing opinion is that this isn't an issue, and the terms are fairly gender-neutral. When viewed through a UK-specific lens, there's a much greater perception of these being gendered terms.

For her, absolutely.	"My fiancé and I have been dating for over 10 years now. Two years ago she moved out of our home state for work. I proposed to her on New Years Day. We've been talking for months since about her moving back and commuting for work. She was on board which was great since our families both live in town and it'd be near impossible for me to find the same job where she lives.

She called me last night crying and in a panic. She told me that she was lying to herself and to me. And she didn't want to start our marriage with regrets. 

She couldn't move back to our home town. She told me that she didn't want to be misgendered by people who she knew from before her transition. Nor could she take anyone referring to her by her dead name. 

When she started talking about being misgendered and deadnamed it brought my mind to this subreddit. This reddit community has taught me a lot about what transfolk go through and how miserable it can feel to be misgendered and deadnamed.

I couldn't put her through that. I told her that I'd move to her. I'd transfer or find a new job entirely. For her, absolutely."	"Crap you two are absolutely precious. Congratulations love birds. Wish you both the best
This is what true love looks like.
Your girlfriend told you that something wouldn't work for her because she's trans, and you didn't question her for a second, you went straight to finding a different way to make your relationship work.  This makes me so happy.
that's so powerful. I am so glad for both of you for having found each other. \[and now I'm crying at work, thanks very much for that. I guess that's my fault for scrolling throw reddit during working hours\]
My fiancée and I are moving also to a better state. Just some areas are easier to live in and there no reason to live around people or places that stress you out!
I expect updates to the precious saga of two people who are in love. I'm glad to see situations like this because it gives me hopes for my future.
That is the purest love man x
Welp you melted my heart.  You are absolutely awesome!  I hope you both keep on rocking and loving!

I've been out as nonbinary to my family for 4 years and they're still only getting it right half of the time on a good day. I completely understand it takes getting used to, because they knew me as cis for 20 years, but 4 years is a long ass time to get used to it. I lived with them for most of that time and I still visit often, so it's not like they've just barely been around me. They're supportive for the most part, they just ""are super duper trying and having a hard time with it"". I dunno. It's honestly really disheartening. I hate to get mad at them, but it's like, at what point do I get to say ""this is goofy, put in a little effort, actually get it right consistently""?"	"I have a nurological issue that affects my memory, and it took me under 3 months to fully swap from she/her to he/him and stop using his deadname.

4 years is a joke, it doesn't take that long at all.
Yeah I'd say it gets ridiculous after the first year tbh, 4 years is atrocious
Stop responding to them when they get it wrong.               ❤️❤️❤️
They are 100% doing it on purpose after so long. If you want to maintain a relationship with them, a serious conversation needs to be had. If not, severely limit the time you spend with them, or cut them out completely.
If my rather conservative in laws, in their 60s, can figure it out with only occassional slip ups, anyone can.
I cut them out at 3 years.  It’s been almost 9 years.

It shouldn’t take more than 6 months.
4 years is a little much. I get sometimes it's hard for people to train their brains to call someone they've known for years by a new name/pronouns, and sometimes accidents happen, but yeah, 4 years says they aren't even bothering to try imo.
nah dude that’s so dumb from them. it’s very irritating, my parents are the same. it’s been almost 4 years now and they still only call me “she” and still insist that they are trying. it’s pathetic, parents can’t say they care about their child and then blatantly disrespect them every single day on purpose. i’m sorry about your family dude, they suck
Right now. Tell them to put in some effort already! Stop responding to your deadname or incorrect pronouns. 

I always tell people to update my name in their phone and delete the old name but also, close your eyes and imagine an Address Book or cell phone Contacts List or an old Rolodex from the 1970's, and visualize yourself physically updating that record. You're applying white-out to the card with my old name, letting it dry, then reeling that index card into your IBM Selectric typewriter, and pounding out my new name on those heavy mechanical keys, and re-inserting it into the Rolodex.
After my grandfather got it right literally the moment I told him, I stopped considering most people's excuses legit. Sure I expected some slip-ups from people who knew me a long time, but it's always clear who is actually trying and who isn't.
This exact thing happened to me. I use they/them pronouns and my family was fucking up for years. One day I said alright there’s gonna be a misgender jar, and started sending Venmo requests for $5 every time someone messed up. They very suddenly figured it out. Now I get misgendered like once a family get together instead of 15 times or so.
When it’s been over a year. Yeah they’ve known you as cis for 20 years, but they see you everyday which gives them more than enough practice. They aren’t actually trying.
When i came out, it took some of my teachers only about a month or so to get my pronouns right 99% of the time, and that was with about 150 students. Four years is bullshit, they blatantly don't care. If they do, they don't care nearly enough.
after a year they should be used to it. four years is wayyy too long
I’m currently at a year and a half on hrt and mine doesn’t try. I’ve been out for 15 years so honestly at this point, I don’t think it’s going to happen for me. 4 years is a long time, maybe cut them out or don’t answer until they do. I have tried both of these with no success.
I give 6 months to a year past that it is a deliberate slight
I would say that after 3 or 4 months has gone by it starts to wear thin. Once its been over a year I call bs.
Honestly it depends for me. This post is talking about family but I had a work colleague that for 6 months would refuse to call me he. I later found out that he fully told a friend of mine that I made there that I'm not a man and that he finds this lifestyle ridiculous. Safe to say I left. With family though, mine get it wrong sometimes but always call me my name. 4 years is definitely too long. I've been out for almost 2 years and they started to get it after maybe 7 months to 10 months in. They call me she sometimes rarely before correcting it. But my name they never get wrong. I think it's worth having a chat if you can.
lol babe it gets redundant after like a month especially if you’re in constant contact with them they need to get a grip
The thing is it isn't hard if they're putting a sincere effort into it and have a healthy and affirming view of gender.  


If it's not due to lack of effort, then it's probably the other reason.
That's ridiculous. Employ the anti dead name tool (an airhorn) and see how long it takes them to change then. I was prepared to give my family a grace period, but they dead named me with such frequency they did a speed run on my good will.
They aren't really trying if they still gets it wrong. I have a friend that had a hard time with my new name, but I just gently corrected each time and he started to get it right. Now he always gets it right.

I would say it gets ridiculous after like 6 months or so. 4 years is ""wtf? do you have a learning disability or something?"". 

Constantly remind them when they mess up. Each and every time. Gently. ""I know you're trying. You can do better"". And when they don't progress you put your foot down harder.
I've been out for over 5 years to my friends and they swapped within the first month of me being out to them
My parents were a little after them but closer to me being a year out to my friends, I haven't had problems after the first 2 months and we recently found and removed a brain tumor from my mom and she's still doesn't misgender me.
After coming out to all of my family none of them have had issue with referring to me by my own name and gender, and those that have I do not speak to anymore.

4 years and they can't get it right is absolutely absurd, and shows they aren't trying
It can literally take years for people to get that you changed your name.

I simply dropped a ""Y"" from my name, and even up to five years later, some of my friends parents still used it.
>.<
My family took a full year to get used to it, and most of my classmates a few months, but four years is a little over the top in my opinion. I mean, it depends on the situation, if you live with them and see them a lot or you don't really see them at all, but all in all, I think a conversation would be in order.
Depending on who it is and how they do it, how they treat you on general, it has seemed pretty apparent when someone is legitimately trying and messing up and when they're not. My grandfather? He's trying, and he's did pretty dang well for a first time only messing up a little after I told him (and he's a bit of a silly, forgetful man). I can tell he's truly trying. My mother in the other hand does NOT want to accept me not love me as her daughter and it shows in her general demeanor and how often she dead names and misgenders me. I can tell she doesn't refer to me properly unless I'm there or someone willing to correct her in my favor.

Frankly, if they care about you they will try harder and you will notice a definite change, and then after a while rarely a slip up. 4 years is a sign of belligerent refusal to try properly nor to care enough about you.
I kinda understand a little bit. Adults learn slower than young ones. Even if its been 4 years, they have been calling you by your dead name and pronouns for much longer, so swapping everything as adults takes a bit longer. Like my manager is in his 60s and i came out to him 3 years ago but he's known me since highschool using my dead name. So for him it was difficult, especially when he is having memory problems cause his age
How long it takes is proportional to how much work you put into it. At this point they're not doing any work, they may think they are because they're not misgendering you all the time.
I’m kinda lucky in the sense that my trans loved one chose to be called by the nickname I always referencing to them by, growing up. 
No they didn’t choose it because of me, and it used to drive them crazy growing up, but it’s always the first thing outta my mouth.


Though I’m Autistic, and my brain kind of goes File/deadname/current name/correct pronouns. 


So it’s like the original director is permanently stuck under deadname and can’t be changed but when I access it it goes to correct name.


If you think of people’s brains as one giant computer your deadname is still rattling around in the folder 📂 for their directory of all things that are inherently you. 


Sometimes their recall reads it wrong, or they had a system restore on the file that is you. It’s like short term memory is stored in the RAM and they’re mind did a RAM dump n then forgot everything that was important that’s new. 
It never gets stored on the disc or rewritten and moved to long term.


Either their hard ware (memory recall)
Or
Software (their personality) 
Is faulty. 

Unfortunately fixing human software isn’t as easy as reinstalling it.

(My aim is to make you laugh, hopefully it works).
bro same. i’ve been out to my family for almost 2 years. it took them no time at all to use my chosen name but they STILL don’t use the correct pronouns and get mad at me when i correct them. shit sucks
In my experience, when people don't get your pronouns or name correct after a long time, it's usually because they're not doing the work mentally. They're still thinking of you as your deadname and pronouns and just applying a filter of sorts (proper name and pronouns) when spoken aloud, rather than actually replacing the old version in their minds.

If they're supportive enough, maybe have a conversation with them about how they think of you and ask them to mentally correct it rather than just verbally apply a filter.
I had a really similar situation with my family (they were all extremely supportive but a lot of misgendering and ""we're really trying"" and me getting really frustrated and being like ""I've been my current name and pronouns for literally 5 years and I have a beard""). I don't think there was anything malicious about it but I did have a conversation with them. Here's the gist of the conversation:

""I know you're having a hard time because you knew me as this for so incredibly long. I appreciate your effort but these mistakes come off in two ways to me.

1: You don't respect me enough to use my name and pronouns.

2: You use my old name and pronouns when referencing me or talking about me when I'm not around.

I'll give you the benefit of the doubt and assume it's not 1. If it's 2 we need to come up with solutions. The first would be update my contact info and photo in your phones to make it a little easier there. The other would be to practice and correct each other or yourself when referencing me or talking about me.""

Luckily this conversation went well for most people involved and definitely resulted in a lot of light bulb moments. I think the real kicker and point of realization was the ""I know you're talking about me with old name and pronouns when I'm not there."" 

Another kicker was me jokingly saying ""I wonder how dumb the waiter thinks you are"" after a family member misgendered me at a restaurant (I pass really well). I don't recommend that method though.
My family got better after a few months, 4 years is insane. I was deadname for 22 years, and many changed instantly, others few weeks or months, years is purposeful I’m sorry.
I set my parents with the expectation that if they misgender me they need to go backs bud correct themself EVERY time. It helped that my sister was super supportive and would correct every single time they messed up. If you have someone who can do this that would be great! Also if your parents practice when you’re not there with each other, they can have a conversation with each other about simple things about you and practice using your pronouns and name. If they aren’t willing to do this then that’s BS. Its some work upfront but once you get the hang of it it becomes so easy. My dad would say for the longest time that it’s just so hard for his old brain and then once my mom started being able to do it I think he realized he was just being lazy.
Mm. One of the many great questions of time 😆
My family has a shitty memory as a whole, myself included. Just hard to make things stick, and hard to override ingrained knowledge. And of course, they've known me for the 26 years I've been alive.

Literally everyone has switched to calling me Kara and she/her within the six months I've been out. Ymmv but 4 years seems like a fucking cop-out excuse at this point.
I just want to say when I first started passing my mother started accusing me of being a traitor and ending up exactly like my father who I am not at all as fucked up as (he’s in his 60s and still passes out drinking and falls through his third floor window in the middle of the night and just sleeps there on the lawn) I don’t know if you really need family to accept your gender identity so much as you need to make sure you achieve your own life goals and make it out of the house safely so that you can live the life you deserve
A strategy I used for someone who was chronically misgendering me was to ask for them to donate $1 to The Trevor Project each time they did so. Helped a lot honestly! Similar low-stakes arrangements can be pretty effective, especially if there’s minor public shame involved tbh
My Japanese teacher took 3 days and she barely speaks English
Its not a habit for them because they don’t want it to become a habit for them. They don’t respect you, and for that I am sorry. You deserve better.
Grab an air horn. Or a spray bottle. Or both.
I'm 30, and my family took about a month to get it right. My 93-year-old grandpa who was bombed by the Japanese Empire in 1941 is the only person in my family I haven't come out to (obvious reasons I think we all understand), and my mom's biggest issue is forgetting that she's SUPPOSED to deadname me with him.
...your family sounds like they're being a$$holes. I'm so sorry. BUT WE LOVE YOU!!!!!
I agree with those saying this indicates not practicing in your absence. I know when mine do this that’s exactly what is happening. It took my brother forever to get they/them but once I’ve added he/him to the mix he’s been fine, but I think this is because they/them is still so “new” to people they will often refuse to learn it and do better with binary changes. But that doesn’t mean that my dad doesn’t get my name right but still uses the entirely wrong pronouns. 

Really it’s personal preference of how long YOU are willing to put up with it and how much you value those relationships. You either set a hard boundary and risk ending those connections or you continue to softly push back and deal with it as a means of keeping the peace. I say when it’s ridiculous is when YOU are fed up. But you do deserve more accuracy after 4 years.
what this means is they are using the deadname and old pronouns behind closed doors, and only trying to remember to be polite directly.
Depending on who is doing it. I might not recommend this.

I got punished by my school for refusing to acknowledge an instructor that refused to learn my pronouns.

Although both the school and instructor kinda Garbo so whatever
That’s such an arbitrary number
I thought I was being very patience, at 3, and now 6, months. Mine aren't even trying. ""You'll always be <deadname>"" I skipped dinner with them.
Tbh I just might do that.
The weird thing is that they're really very loving parents and I'm very close to them, I know they care a lot about my wellbeing. I think the problem is that they still fundamentally think of me as a woman and are trying to kindly humor my gender identity. I've had to misgender a trans friend to people she wasn't (and did not want to be) out to at the time and it took sustained mental effort to do, because to my mind, she was firmly filed as a woman. If that's what they're having to do, I understand that that's hard. I guess I just wish they could actually perceive me differently.
I think that's exactly the problem, yeah.
yep exactly. they're fucking it up still because it isn't a habit for them, it's something they're making an effort to do to your face. if they used the right name and pronouns when you're not around, and corrected themselves when messing up when you're not around, it would be ingrained by now.

big empathy OP, my parents and sister are the same. six years and counting and mum still gets it wrong regularly.
It takes people a little while to correct themselves.  It took my little brother 6 months to adjust.  He never messes it up now.  Meanwhile the rest of my family still uses the wrong name.
But what I’m saying is like if your brother did it in 6 then is anyone else supposed to get with the program because he did? I mean yeah 3 years I can understand but there’s no one size fits all to this
It’s a simple change. People will immediately correct when told they’re wrong about an animal’s sex.  People will immediately change when a woman gets married and changes her name or vice versa.  Or when someone goes by a nickname.

Not putting the effort to change a simple habit for trans people when they do make a change in almost any other setting is plain disrespect.  I gave my family years to make a simple change.  In the time I gave them, we had a marriage in the family and they all immediately swapped last names for the bride. They chose not to make a change for me because they don’t respect me for my being trans.  It’s as simple as that."	12kv2e3	trans	217	0.96	2023-04-13 16:39:30
How do I stop misgendering myself mentally	I do it all the time and it annoys me when I will be going about life and I refer to my self as a man within my own head sometimes.	"Honestly, it takes time, I came out to my wife in April 2021, and I still do this to myself occasionally...
Correct yourself mentally like you would correct someone else. Eventually it stops.
Whenever I think of myself as a boy, I imagine myself as a girl doing a bad imitation of a boy, then switch back to normal like it was a joke.
I used to have internal dialogue that said ""F me, (deadname), you're stupid"" when I did something that triggered me to berate myself. I've been training myself to voluntarily say ""Eva, you dumb broad"" when I make small, inconsequential mistakes, and that seems to be bleeding over into my inner dialogue in my less controlled moments.
Each time you mentally misgender yourself or misname yourself,  think of three sentences about you using the correct language. Your brain has these old references stored and saying three different sentences with the correct language prods your brain to update those references. Kinda like a browser cache, if you're familiar with that.
Be patient with yourself also, you’ve referred to yourself as a man for X years of your life, that won’t swap in a few months. I’m at around a year of being out and acknowledging that I’m trans myself, and it still happens sometimes. Just correct it and don’t dwell on it. You know you aren’t doing it on purpose, it’s just a habit❤️
Yeah it happens. When I first started going by she/her it felt pretty wierd saying it in my own head but whenever someone referred to me as she/her I loved it. It's gotten to the point now where I'm comfortable in my sense of self and hardly ever dead name or misgender myself any more. Like most things about transitioning it takes time to adjust I guess, I remember being super uncomfortable being seen wearing a dress but now I rock it with confidence.
In my French mind I struggled with this, because adjectives are gendered, and I always used masculine ones that are shorter (ex: grand (""gran"" ) and grande (""grand"" )) so to reduce dysphoria in public I mainly used phrases with genderless or pronounced the same regardless of gender (immense, or fatigué/fatiguée (tired)).
It takes time but practicing in public under everybody's nose was fantastic.
The thing I struggled most with was ""Je suis con"" (I'm stupid, in a masculine way), to which I learned to say ""Je suis conne"" (in a feminine way, different pronunciation).

TL;DR: takes time and practice, and if you use a heavily gendered language, try going gender neutral or gender stealthy. Stay strong, you can do it
It takes time, don't get offended BY YOURSELF
❤️my therapist suggested to me that I should write a journal in the 3rd person for completely separate reasons, but it helped me lessen the amount of times I misgendered myself, which was a nice side bonus☺️❤️
This is probably very specific but you know that thing in Game of Thrones where the ""Dance Master"" kept referring to Arya as ""A boy""? ""A boy does x."" ""A boy doesn't listen."" Whatever. I started referring to myself in the third person as ""a boy"". I just thought it was funny. Since coming out I've started referring to myself in the third person as ""a punk"". People get a chuckle out of it but it allows me to not gender myself specifically with people I don't know.

In terms of mentally the more I repeat it the better I get at not thinking of myself in any terms other than how I truly feel.

I know that's a little niche but I hope it helps at least a little.
ive been out for about 2 years now, and ive known i was trans for longer than that. but i still sometimes misgender or deadname myself in my head! although, my family doesnt use my name and pronouns very often - so im still in like a middle-ground area where im comfortable with being myself, but i still feel a partial association with my deadname and agab lol.

i think its because we're so used to being referred to as our agab that it just becomes a habit. kinda like how it can feel weird when you first start going by your chosen name and pronouns because youre not used to it yet. 

ive also noticed that when im around my family and people that deadnames and misgenders me, i refer to myself as my agab and deadname in my head more often; but when im with my friends and people that use my name and pronouns, i refer to myself as my chosen name and pronouns more often. 

but something that helped me is imagining everyday interactions where someone is calling me a boy (im ftm) and using my chosen name! like when im bored or doing something that doesnt take much focus, ill imagine something like being called ""sir"" in public or something like that :)
I’ve been trans for 8 years and I still internally say “I want to be a better boyfriend”. I’m sorry, you’re not alone.
I struggle with this still after 3 years but only taking myself seriously for a year or so.

What I just recently started doing is when I am thinking and the words he/him cross my mind in reference to me, or in a case I’m pondering somebody else thinking about me, I physically verbalize “she” to correct and reaffirm myself.

“She”

“She”

“She”

“She”

“She”

It’s difficult to retrain yourself. Probably more difficult than for others to retrain to use your new pronouns, themselves.
I do it so often, I’m bigender so it isn’t a huge deal, I’m a part time woman so half of the time it’s fine
Practice makes perfect. It will take a while but over time it will happen less and less as long as you make the effort.
I hope the answer is transitioning to the point where your life just feels womanly when you just don’t have the effort…. That’s what I did as a man by growing a beard…
I still do it sometimes and I've been out for 3 years. It will probably go away the further you get into your transition, especially when/if you take steps like HRT
It will pass, be patient with yourself
Time
It just takes time, but if you want to make it happen quicker, you can repeat in your head some phrases you have problem. that actually helped me, I hope it'll help you
I do it too, I'm not sure how to do it beyond making yourself feel/ look more like your chosen gender to help you
9 years into my transition and this still happens to me. Don’t worry about it
Time™
It happens less and less but I’m 5 years into social transition. 4.5 years hrt. I still do it in my head. Sometimes I’ll even dead name myself in my head. It happens. It happens less and less. Anymore it’s like “where the fuck did that come from?!”
It’s a trick I’ve haven’t mastered quite yet, I’m hoping with time it will get better
It will come with practice. Took me about a year to stop misgendering myself. I'm still working on correcting others for misgendering me, even those who are close to me I just let it slide more often than I would like. You'll get it. There's no time frame or helpful secret to achieving a natural state of referring to yourself as you feel to be. If I choose a single word I could say that I believe would work for your purposes, it would be: ""Mindfulness""

You're trying to undo (X) years of being conditioned to refer to yourself as male. Be kind and patient with yourself and others as you learn to become the person you mean to be.

(X) is your age.
i really get the frustration about that...my best friend was the first person i consistently spoke using he/him for myself with irl, and at the start i always misgendered myself as well as inside my head. just needs practice and time, u can try sentences and stuff to maybe help you
Honestly it's one of those things that just goes away with time. I'm pretty sure we've all been there at some point lol
the complete trust is just patience. gently correcting yourself and remind yourself this doesn’t make you any less valid. it’ll come in time and before you know it it’ll be second nature and you won’t even process it anymore
I do this too. Especially because I’m not physically transitioning right now and sometimes feel out of place referring to myself as a man (I’m transmasc) even if it feels more comfortable for me to refer to myself as a man. I don’t know if you go through this as well.
It'll take some time. I would write in third person. So, like: ""[Chosen name] is going to the mall. [Perferred pronouns] look [handsome/pretty/good-looking, etc.] today."" That's what I did; however, I love to write, so my way may not work for you.

Edit: ""ect"" to ""etc"".
Babe I've been on testosterone for 3 years and sometimes I girl myself in my head. All your neurons developed around your internal monologue and sometimes they follow a pathway that triggers a misgender. As you gender yourself properly your neurons will build along this path and less and less often will you misgender yourself. (not sure if the brain science helps but that is actually why this happens and its not ur fault it just the physical location of your brain cells)
The hardest part for me is changing my internal monologue to that of a feminine voice. It’s something that I have no clue how to easily do, and man is it weird. 

Old habits die hard, I guess.
I'm about to be 5 years in and I'm just now getting used to it. Takes time
I recently I realized I wasn’t cis and only connected with the idea of being a woman because I was socialized into it as a result of being AFAB and I still refer to myself as a woman. I’m sure it will take both of us time though for me (I’ll still be like “maybe I am cis?” every time it happens until I realize I’m valid again)
Time my love. You have to change a (how ever old you are) year habit. I misgender myself more than anyone else lol but it's getting there
i changed my name and pronouns a few months ago and sometimes still forget, i usually just laugh about it
it takes time, ive been out about a year and a half and its gotten much better but i still hear my deadname floating around in my internal monologue for no reason sometimes
Same way you would stop misgendering someone else time and work
Say it correctly out loud. Saying my thoughts out loud to myself gives me a chance to hear what the thought sounds like and also cements it further into my mind.  Think of it this way, a thought is never truly real until brought out into physical reality in some way.  Vibrating the real air around you with it does that in a way, even if briefly. Bring it from abstract into reality. Hope that helps.
Daily words of affirmation write it on the mirror or on your phone background
You can try correcting yourself mentally, but it will just take time. It still happens for me sometimes, but sometimes I'm just lost in the euphoria. If I'm high or in the moment with my gf, I would swear I was cis female, with how things are feeling and how my mind images myself.
Imagine you go years singing a song every day, only to find out you were singing the lyrics wrong. You're gonna remember it occasionally, but muscle memory will win most of the time and you'll get it wrong. How would you go about getting it right with a song? Sing it over and over again and repeat. Convert that back to gendering yourself correctly: commentate everything you do ""she opens the door and walks through"" ""she looks in the fridge and thinks about what to eat, only to discover she's not actually hungry just bored so she goes back to lay on her bed"" ""she texts her friends about what a wonderful day she had"", etc, etc. I hope this helps (:
it happens to the best of us :(
does this still happen to anybody in their dreams?
I have a similar problem where when i try to refer to myself as a girl my brain goes, no youre not.
Yeah it’s just a little annoying when I can’t transition physically yet or socially out side my house and family and walk around thinking of myself as a male lol
It’s definitely getting better with time
I love this!
Okay first of all, I love your name so much, Eva is such an amazing name. And honestly I do exactly what you used to do, over time I do it less especially when gaming but I think of my self by my dead name at home from time to time. That being said it’s hard not to with e big ol’ doofus (deadname) name badges on my desk for work. 😂
i do exactly the same thing
Honestly I'm doing basically the same... Although I don't use the word broad I use another B word. Just like ""Cece you dumb bitch"" ""real smart Cece."" Or for more neutral inner monologue, to a non-existent audience ""it's ya girl"" (just randomly) or ""this girls getting hungry""
I do a similar thing where I'd I berate myself with my dead name I immediately go ""nah Callie you got this"" or something similar
Came here to find this 💝

Find friends, communities, anyone that you enjoy and who respects who you are and ask them if they can help you practice. Ask them to talk with you as if they were talking about you to someone else. Even if it feels super awkward it is very affirming and good practice.

Give it some time and be patient sounds like hell but it is worth it to play the long game. There is a lot you can make amazing progress on in the mean time. I have been out for 19 months now. So many things are so much better now but I have not even come close to running out of exciting news things to explore and or improve upon.

Keep your chin up girl. You are worth it. Great yourself like you would a best friend. None of the ""you mess up you stupid..."", naw, nine of that. When you never yourself just think ""oh, that was not right, this other thing is correct"", and it will be habit before you know it.

Gendered language is tough, I did French for a class for a few years. And that’s what confused me the most since different people would say different things that meant the same … anyways I’m getting side tracked. Thanks for the amazing reply and the great advice ♥️
I’ve always wanted to start a journal but I can’t hand write well and I’m lazy but this might be a good reason to start a journal
I don’t watch game of thrones and I don’t have PlayStation but if I did there would be a Kratos God of War “Boy” joke to make although I don’t know anything about it so I won’t make that joke.  ❤️
I find it quite funny how even our closest friends and family manage to get our pronouns picked up almost effortlessly sometimes and yet we can’t pick it up that quickly for ourselves. Brains are weird things sometimes. ❤️

Edit: just remembered what I forgot to say; I find that mental pronouns are something that a lot of us didn’t think about prior to transitioning etc, it never crossed my mind until recently.
""part time woman"" haha thats amazing i love it
I think so, tbh probably doesn’t help having a puberty moustache going rn before I transition medically lol. 😂
That’s exactly what I think tbh
Same 😁
That’s exactly how I feel tbh. I’m still male presenting and have a puberty moustache kinda thing going on, male hair cut, etc even though I know I’m trans fem it feels weird to be called she looking how I do

Hello! You have made the mistake of writing ""ect"" instead of ""etc.""

""Ect"" is a common misspelling of ""etc,"" an abbreviated form of the Latin phrase ""et cetera."" Other abbreviated forms are **etc.**, **&c.**, **&c**, and **et cet.** The Latin translates as ""et"" to ""and"" + ""cetera"" to ""the rest;"" a literal translation to ""and the rest"" is the easiest way to remember how to use the phrase.

Far more common when your haven't publically transitioned. Stay strong. Stay close with the people who you've come out to.
Same!
It is a bit of a double edged sword type solution. By berating myself more often, I've trained myself to use my deadname less while doing it. The trick will be to eventually stop explicitly berating myself over the small things.
That's probably much healthier, if I'm honest. Berating myself over spilled milk just to build a habit isn't without psychic cost.
This comment was so reaffirming to me, girl. I find it quite interesting how brains work. Fascinating stuff.
Haha. That's fair enough. I don't really rate GOT. The first couple of seasons were great and then it started deviating from the text and got obscenely violent. I don't mind 'some' gore but the show went mental and there was a particular scene when I turned it off and never turned it back on again.

I would recommend the books but I don't know if he's actually going to finish them. There are few things less satisfying than an unfinished series. I'll never forgive Douglas Adams for dying so young.

I feel as though you might be being facetious but I don't think I know enough about the game to get the joke I'm sorry.
Thanks, it’s the best terminology I can think of, i don’t know if I’ll ever be able to talk to myself fully be able to call myself a man. It’s also hard because Im a lesbian and people find it odd that im a lesbian I just think that describes md the best, and being a dude I’d kinda an internal thing, I’d never cut off my titties or anything I guess it’s just a internal thing ( I’m about as manly as a gay man anyway [how media portrays them that is] you wouldn’t call me a manly guy but my point is it’s internal for the most part) guess I could be part time straight man but that doesn’t sound as good LMAO
I should hope so! Thanks sis!
Agreed, it’s much easier when others say it too, but it also helps once you’re able to look in the mirror or look down and see yourself in congruence with what you feel.
Thanks, will do. ❤️
This makes me feel so much better 😮‍💨
I'm glad! It is amazing how quickly something can go from the most terrifying thing ever to just commonplace. Strolling into the women's restroom with confidence has yet to steer me wrong.
Your welcome babe 😃

Told my psychologist that im nonbinary and she said something really weird...Idk how to feel about it	"She does accept me but...She started telling me about how she has seen other trans clients such as myself and she told me about this one girl \[Who she misgendered and called a boy\]; She kinda suggested that she got bullied a lot and because of that, she found the trans community and was ''influenced'' into transitioning and that her life is worse now. She also told me that even though I say I'm nb, I'll always be a girl and \[birthname\] inside...Thoughts? Like, is she tranphobic or misguided? Am I just blowing this out of proportion? Keep in mind, she didn't say anything in a malicious tone and also, I live in a country where LGBT stuff is less known about.

&#x200B;

Edit: Shouldve mentioned that I'm not seeing her anymore as of today, not because of what she said but for personal reasons. I'd just like to know for future reference if what she said was ok.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: Damm, I knew something was up but she just said it so kindly and sympathetically that I thought it was kinda ok..? Like I didn't agree with what she was saying but I thought she was trying to help me...Ty for the support, guys; I know what to look out for in the future."	"Oh buddy that's just straight up basic transphobia and she is not a safe person to work with
see your edit, and i am glad... she's pushing debunked bullshit put out by explicitly anti-trans bigots, through a pay-to-publish papermill.

So, without delving into your trans experiences any more or exploring how your whole gender experience developed … she flat out told you that „others like you“ were not actually trans and are more unhappy now?  

That is not professional at all. She comes to conclusions without proper assessment.   
Doesn‘t matter if you‘re trans or a questioning cis person, this is a bad basis to help you.
Just from a professional standpoint, your psychologist is not supposed to bring up other clients and their stories - it's a serious breach of their confidentiality. 

Hell yes she was being transphobic.
...how does she know her client wasn't bullied over her trans personality before realizing she was trans? (asked in a ""what'd he use for rope"" tone a la pirates of the Caribbean).  

Seriously though, I got bullied for not being masculine enough LOOOOOONG before I had any understanding of trans issues or gender dysphoria.  One of the many, many, MANY pieces of evidence I'd piled up over the years before learning about that and having the vocabulary to understand it.  It's the big reason I want kids to be able to learn about stuff like that, so many points in my life where that would've been helpful to know.
Yeah,, that’s transphobia-
She did not accept you in fact... Also your therapist should be supportive...
First and foremost I’d like to state that I am so sorry you had that experience with a mental health professional it was extremely inappropriate of her to say something like that to you in a session especially because she was aware that you yourself identify as a trans individual. I’m not sure what the laws are where you live but where I live it’s illegal of her to be telling you information about another patients session but with that being said if she was telling you another patient’s story who is to say she wasn’t telling other people your information as well, I would definitely report her. Laws and rules aside it is super inappropriate and I’m sorry she said those things to you! It’s funny to me when transphobic people use the term “you’ll always be a ___ on the inside” it’s like have you seen my insides? No? Good then you’ve admitted you don’t know what you’re talking about 😂 also ✨INTERSEX PEOPLE EXIST✨ I Was going to go on a whole tangent about how only you know who you are and all that but I’ve already probably overshared so I’ll leave this off by saying you are completely valid and i’m really glad you won’t be seeing her anymore. Have a good rest of your day or night! 🥺💕
This is blatant transphobia. I’m sorry :(
That's transphobia, seek a new therapist and report her
Therapists like that are a major contributing factor in why trans lives are objectively worse by most metrics that measure quality of life.

A good therapist would help you gain coping mechanisms for coming out and dealing with those hardships to come, not try to shove you back into the closet to make their own job easier.
No, that’s not okay. She’s pushing a personal narrative onto you without even hearing your feelings. That’s not professional tbh
I'd leave based on you're suggestion that she mis gendered another trans person then I'd leave.
yeah no, that was totally transphobic.

you won't always be [deadname], you won't always be a girl inside. more likely, you never were a girl inside. i certainly wasn't  - just got pressured by society into thinking i was.

also, being trans is just who we are. i wasn't bullied as a kid, i wasn't abused as a kid, i have no trauma from when i was a kid. and yet deep inside, i've always known i was a guy. being trans is not a choice, and saying that it is is transphobic.

also she was just generally tryna pressure you into not transitioning. which is not a very accepting thing to do.
I almost dropped my current psychologist for way less! He’s just doesn’t really know much, but doesn’t take awful positions like your’s.
Gtfo that is not a good person to work with
yeah that's a full nope right there friend
That’s transphobia in its prime
That is just transphobic-
Sounds like you need a new therapist. You should take a lot of time to think things over before transitioning and be prepared for the possibility that it ends up being the wrong path for you. But telling you that your life will be worse if you transition is some transphob shit.
She's using a lot of correlation based claims with no absolute basis, also saying that you'll always be who you were known as at birth on the inside is like, hella transphobic
Professional counselor here.  That is text book non gender informed response.   She’s transferring a whole lot of her agenda and world view onto you.  This is reflective of some of the transphobic messaging currently circulating that trans community is recruiting people to transition.  I’m sure that might happen but it’s not common place at all.  Truth is awareness and access to care have given more people hope and that’s why more trans people feel more comfortable being more open about who they are.  Your psychologist not a good fit for gender care.
Thats illegal she cant disclose her clents information like that, very unprofessional. You should try to report them to whatever practice issued their license to therapy
Yuck what a gross person that therapist is
*A friendly reminder that psychologists aren't real doctors, and unlike psychiatrists, can make you feel even worse than before, if you pick a wrong psychologist, or if you don't need a psychologist at all.*

If you suspect that you might have a mental illness, then you should go to a psychiatrist instead.

If you're 100% sure that you don't, then you have the right to either find another psychologist, or just straight up stop visiting them. If you know that your psychologist doesn't help you, then you don't need them.
Transphobic, and some other kind of stupid
Get a new psych, my psych is super chill I’m trans and loves seeing my life progress in positive ways.
yup yup yup this is transphobia. for context she may be directly referring to the idea of ""rapid onset gender dysphoria"" aka that trans kids (usually afab trans kids) only feel dysphoric bc they're ""socially influenced"" or whatever. it's a bunch of bunk, this idea has been extensively criticized by psychologists actually worth their salt, and can actually be very damaging and cause trans kids to try and minimze their issues rather then express themselves. she was wrong and shitty, even if she said it kindly. a lot of people are probably going to use that tone of fake ass sympathy to try and coax you out of being who you are. not all hatred or malicious stuff is always easy to spot or super outright/obvious. don't worry, you're not blowing anything out of proportion. as a practicing therapist, she should know better.
Just posting to agree with the top comments. That's really alarming extreme transphobia. She's reciting word for word what some of the most extreme ""influencers"" in the transphobic circles have been saying for a while now. I'm glad you got out now, because she was gaslighting you to make you ""convert"" back to cis.
Fucking get. A new therapist. Asap.she will make transitioning a living hell.
Shes literally pushing the ""social contagion"" myth fueling many of the fucked up laws in the US and elsewhere.
I’ve had a therapist say that  “being trans won’t fix me” or “many people think they’re ace because of sexual assault” it hurts
Yeah the comments here are right. That’s the classic transphobic line from a psychologist. The entire saying it in a kind and sympathetic tone is how they manipulate and gaslight yiu more effectively. Most of us learned this the hard way too.
Good call to terminate with this therapist. She has an agenda and it isn’t anything that would have helped you. Listen to your gut.😊
Sooo transphobic and breaching doctor-patient confidentiality.
You gotta throw the whole therapist away
i cant even read the whole thing. only read half of the first paragraph. that’s transphobic no ifs, ands, or buts!
Good thing you got rid of her. Yes, that is definitely NOT supportive at all and very unprofessional to discuss other clients of hers.  Find someone else that makes you feel more comfortable. Therapists sometimes aren’t good fits, and some are downright awful. Good riddance.
That’s very unprofessional. Not only is she demonising something that is a part of you, she is also talking to you about other clients in detail. Absolutely not a safe therapist.
I've dealt with so many people who say they aren't against it and support you but then they misgender you or someone they are talking about, like I've even made a point to correct them and they still do it. It's hella frustrating
I agree. Full on *transphobic*
Yep. The “influence” argument is one of the common transphobe conspiracy theories."	xpc9sg	trans	212	0.99	2022-09-27 09:53:46
I feel horrible today , I'm so tired of being misgendered by my coworkers I just feel like quitting		"I like you might just have asshole co-workers.  No idea where you work but if it's company big enough to have an HR department, they might be interested to hear what you have to say.
Misgendered? I think you're a gorgeous woman!
If you're getting misgendered, there's no hope for the rest of us. 
Every time I see your pictures I can't help feeling jealous of how cute you are. :p
[deleted]
FYI I didn't read the headline because my line of sight was on the picture when I refreshed the page and guess what: You pass! <3
Hope that helps. Sincerely.
Don't let them get you down. You're so strong for making it this far and I know you can continue. The posts of yours I've seen in my feed I've always been envious of because you are so gorgeous. You undeniably pass so don't let them get to you and keep being your wonderful you!
Sorry that your coworkers are giving you such a hard time. Hope everything works out well for you ❤️❤️❤️
I’m sorry it must get hard af. I would never tell you are trans. Unlike myself I unfortunately look pretty masculine. You look good girl 
If you give in now, they win. You are far too strong to allow that. It’s obvious you’re truly a beautiful woman, no matter what you co-workers say. Hang in there. 
Considering I’d have no idea you were AMAB until you told me, this is absolutely because they’re assholes. You’re extremely passing. There is 0 reason for them to get “confused” or any other excuse because there’s nothing ambiguous about your looks. You don’t just forget you’re a woman when you look like you do. They’re absolutely doing this to hurt you. 

If you feel like you can do it, tough it out and don’t let them win. However, there is nothing wrong with if you need to quit for your mental health’s sake. 
Dont let it get to you. Be you and win at it! Your beautiful and extremely passable. Your really a inspiration  ❤❤ 
Had a horrible day at work too, I know how you feel.  Hope it gets better soon!!
You deserve so much better than their deliberate mistreatment, if you can find a better workplace then I'd say go for it imo <3
You can’t let un-evolved people effect your life. Live for yourself.
Screw them, your beautiful 
You're getting fiercer by the day! 🤩
You're looking amazing hun. Fuck those people you're sexy as hell. 🤗
Obviously they are just being asshats.  You look really great in your pic and like a very nice person dispite your horrible coworkers.  Please go back and talk to your HR people after reading your policies and procedure manual.  There should be a section about harrassment, hostile work ennviroment, and a non discrimination portion.  Arm yourself with that knowledge and show them how this must stop right away or you were go higher up the chain.  Even if it makes you unconfortable you've stated that you may quit anyway so you misewell take a run at this if you feel up to it.  
How would they misgender you?? 
I mean all you need is a nose and jawline adjustment and you'll pass. Other than that, you look pretty female.
It is a really big company I'm standing in one of the aisles I work in in the picture , the customers don't misgender me it's just my fellow employees constantly , I have tried HR and they didn't help
Or they need glasses desperately.
You just made me laugh so hard
Thank you, sort of.  But my ability to pass has nothing to do with the issue.  They should be gendering me correctly regardless of how well I pass.
Yep, go to HR and say this phrase verbatim, ""The harassment that I am being subjected to from my coworkers constitutes a *Hostile Work Environment*. Do you intend to handle this situation? If not I will be forced to file a formal complaint with the EEOC"" 

The key phrase is, ""Hostile Work Environment"", and it's the grounds that you will sue the shit out of them for, unless they Fix This Problem. They'll recognize it, and if they're not dopes, they'll move Rull Fast.


I'd say look around for the same job at a different company, use your accomplishments at the old company so far on the CV and hopefully nobody continues to be a shithead to you.
What is your prefered gender? If someone does not know your prefered gender, would you like them to ask what it is, or would you prefer to correct them if they use the wrong one and hope they adjust?
Interesting, hmm, I might just do this.  Thank you.
My preferred gender is female I was assigned male at Birth I have been openly transitioning at work for 3 years and everyone knows my preferred pronouns yet my co-workers still misgender me constantly
You can read more about this here - https://www.eeoc.gov/eeoc/newsroom/wysk/enforcement_protections_lgbt_workers.cfm#examples and https://www.eeoc.gov/laws/types/harassment.cfm. Specifically:

It's my birthday	Today is my birthday and it was amazing. I went to my first pride parade with my best friend, I dressed up nicely, I was waving my trans flag happily for 2 hours. I had a piece of pie, with my friend, made some jewelry and bought new jewelry supplies. It was so good, until I came back home. My mother talked to me. It was a normal conversation, until she misgendered me. I've been out for more than a year now and she still does it. She still calls me her daughter. I corrected her, and she took at as an attack and agression. I had a moment alone, but I decided to confront her. I said a lot of thing about how it hurts me. She does not get it. She still acts like a victim. I didn't thought that I would cry out of pure despair on my birthday, but here we are I guess. My name is Robin, I'm non-binary and I'm not a girl.	"Hi Robin 💕 Happy birthday buddy 🥰 I'm so sorry you had to deal with that, but I'm also glad you did get to enjoy part of your day before going home. We love you, Robin, and we're proud of you for standing up for your identity and being your authentic self. We're here for you if you need us 💖
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday, Robin!!
Hey Robin, happy birthday!!!!
Happy Birthday Robin.
Happy birthday!
Happy birthday Robin!
Happy birthday Robin! Im sorry about what happened bud.
Ask her if she had a name she hated in school, and deadnaming is like her being called that by family..
Happy birthday Robin
Happy birthday Robin! I'm so sorry about your momster.
Well, merry Birthday to you
Happy birthday! I hope things get better for you! All the best from some random person from the internet!
1st happy birthday.  By what I have heard it's hardest to deal with gender issues with family and close friends and partners. They already knew or had ideas of our issues and can be accepting.  Or they resist and ignore the future changes. Religion and politics don't help. But sometimes they just don't want to lose the child they raised. Many can't understand how hard life is for those that feel different and wish to transition. Their brain is locked into what they want and what they think as stable. Trans upsets that balance. 

My parents have past so I don't have to deal with that issue.  My sister has known I have had issues with relationships and self image. She is at least open minded.  Asking if I wanted to be a woman or how far I wanted to go. I'm still learning about that. 

Remember your journey will take time. And others around you need time as well to adjust. Some longer than others
happy birthday!
Happy birthday! I’m sorry for what you’re going through, I hope you can get through this.
Happy birthday Robin, I'm very sorry that happened to you, but at least the rest of your day was good
get up, take my digital hugs, and go out there and sting like an enBEE
Happy Birthday.
お誕生日おめでとう、ロビン！
Happy birthday, Robin! I’m glad you had a great Pride parade and pie fun with your friend! 💜🌈

Maybe you can make a talisman with your new jewelry making supplies?

Best of excellent good luck 💜💜🙏🌈🍀✨
Hello Robin! Happy birthday! It’s also my birthday too. I’m so sorry you had to go through that. My dm’s are open if you ever need to chat or anything
Happy birthday robin! I love your name!
Happy birthday Robin ❤️
Happy birthday Robin 💕
So..... and frankly IDGAF if this crosses a line.

Good on ya, happy to see you getting out there.

But I've read your feed and now I'm wondering how old you are and whether or not we live in the same country and if I have to be worried in a very adult and very professional manner.

I'm a social worker and darling, I want you to know that if there's ever ANYTHING you need to get off your chest with a trans veteran (10 years out) then do not fucking hesitate to DM me and I will do what I can.

I'm happy you got to experience Pride. I'm worried about your safety. 

Sorry, not sorry - but I take my professional code of ethics very serious.
Happy birthday Robin! Sorry that your mum is like that.
Happy birthday!!! Hopefully your mom turns around one day.
Happy birthday Robin! Focus on the good things of your day and don't let your mom ruin it
Happy birthday Robin and am happy you had an amazing time at the pride parade. It's so good thsg tiu got to do what you like. Sorry that you had an issue with your mom. Please don't let that get to you this is your day and no negative talk or comments should make be sad. It hurts me that you had to cry on your birthday when all you need to be doing is smiling and being happy. We love you friend and we always will. Keep being strong and enjoying the new year you have reached.
Happy birthday Robin."	wtbdwl	trans	212	0.99	2022-08-20 16:35:34
I feel like I failed this community	"So I was talking with my ""moderately"" transphobic mother about watching a movie with a friend who is non binary, but it's really hard to because I can't use ""they"" to refer to them. (mind you I speak Spanish so if I used the correct pronoun ""Elle"" it would be obvious that they are non binary)
I tried once to use the correct pronoun but she got really angry and told to stop inventing shit.
I don't know what to do... I really feel bad misgendering my friend even if it's in private and they aren't there (I would feel bad if I knew my friends misgendered me in private) but I don't know how to deal with this? I really don't want to misgender anyone not even in private but also I don't want to get in more arguments.... It feels like every time you mention someone who is trans even if the topic isn't about the fact that they are trans, it always ends up becoming into a debate about trans identities and I hate it. 
Why can't trans people just exist and be without people always bringing out the fact that they are trans? It's like they reduce one person to just one thing ""trans"" and there is nothing more to talk about them."	"I don't think your friend would be mad at you for doing this since you're clearly under a lot of pressure to gender them incorrectly. Maybe talk to them about it to be totally straightforward? It might help your conscience too.
I would talk to your friend and explain your home situation with them. As someone who is trans-masc non-binary dating a man whose family is conservative-leaning, I've told him that it's fine to misgender me around his family in order for him to stay safe. Safety is always number 1 for me. Hopefully your friend will understand that!
I would use genderless words so the transfobic people can tell you are not ""inventing things"" and they can't complain haha like when you talk about your friend say something like, ""mi persona cercana"" even if it sounds weird, better so they can tell it's on purpose haha
I don't like that you misgendered them, but it definitely felt like you didn't have a choice and I can't blame you for it, I think others might think the same but we won't think badly of you because of it
Oh I think something like this is currently ongoing with me. I have a transfem friend who goes to a different school and last year we went to the same football game. So when I got home my mom asked me “so who was that [school name] boy?” and she doesn’t believe trans girls are girls and I didn’t want to out my friend to my mom so I panicked and said “‘His’ name is [deadname]” and after that I immediately messaged her explaining it and apologizing and she said it was completely okay and then we joked about it

Since I’ve convinced my mom that she goes by [Chosen name :3] as a “”nickname”” so I’m at least not deadnaming her when mom wants to talk about it.

And this was before I came out to her as transmasc or even knew I was transmasc so trust me it totally hurt my s o u l to say it.
As a trans person myself (and a Spanish speaker as well), my friends have to do that with me too, whenever I meet them at their houses we have to use female pronouns. I understand they do that because their parents aren't supportive, and I'm actually thankful they do that bc I don't want to get into a discussion with their parents. Something that we do as well is avoiding pronouns as much as possible (like, changing the way we use adjectives and stuff like that), and instead of calling me a ""he"" or a ""they"" just call me by my name.

The point is- Even though every person is different, I think your friend wouldn't be mad at you for doing that if they know that your mom is not supportive. In some way, you're protecting, and you're preventing to get into an argument
I'd double check with the friend, but sometimes it's okay to not ""out"" the friend in front of transphobic people. Some transphobes can react badly to knowing about trans people, and not causing a fuss is sometimes the better choice.
My best friend’s family is right wing conservative anti trans you name it they are it. She however isn’t and hates her family for it. But she can’t move out. I came out to her and gave her explicit permission for her own safety (and my own because I know them) to not only misgender me but to use my deadname around them. Every where else she uses my name and pronouns no sweat. But if you explain the situation to them, that it’s dangerous for you (which is valid 100%) hopefully they will understand. If they don’t, then I wouldn’t call them a friend. If they can’t understand that this is a dangerous situation, do they really care? Your safety is just as important as theirs. Just like my friends safety is just as important as mine
Unpopular opinion here but as long as it doesn’t put you in danger, you could just continue to push the issue with your mom.
You could also not have your friend around your transphobic mother. You have to think of the impact of her transphobia on your friend.
You have no choice, BUT to misgender your friend around your mom if she's gonna yell at you for using their pronouns

I get that you want to respect your friend and their gender identity, but it's better to lie and misgender them than get in trouble and possibly have your mom forbid you from seeing your friend
Yes, I don't care about changing my voice at all.
i know it’s hard with gendered languages but! a tip that could help is trying to only use their name instead of any pronouns. you could also switch btw the male and female pronouns if that’s less obvious? (that’s what i do for myself and other nbs sometimes)
I thought about it but I'm afraid they'll get angry with me. Most of my friends families are somewhat more accepting and they don't know that my parents are kinda conservative (they hide it pretty well)....
Honestly my conscience is killing me.
i hope so too... I just feel sometimes like all my friends are very open about their identity and kinda forget that some people like me can't. I really don't want to be mean or hurt anyone but I really don't feel safe to be that open in this moment...
I find this as a passive way to fight back
I'm just tired of having to start ""debate"" about trans right when I just want to have a casual conversation with my family. Everytime I use the correct pronouns and try to do right I'm mocked for being a snowflake or I start an argument.
I'm getting really tired of all the fighting but it's scares me that sometimes to avoid fights I have to use incorrect pronouns. (deadnaming is off limits though)
Yeah, I think the least I can do is not to deadname them but having to purposely misgender someone makes me really sad and angry. :(((

Being in the closet for safety reasons sucks because it's not only me who is in there but I feel like I also sometimes have to shove people back in when talking about them with family because I really don't want to get in trouble....
Honeslty most times I think is better to avoid a fuss about stuff if it's in private just to avoid more fights home.
I mean, I've tried once to correct her but she wouldn't understand why I used ""fake"" pronouns and got angry (really angry) when tried to explain what non binary is.
tbh is kind of embarrassing to have friends over because my mother will sometimes make transphobic, fatphobic, etc... comments from other room thinking no one hears her so I honestly don't invite that many friends over. My friend doesn't know I have used wrong pronouns but I just feel awful about doing it.
Yeah that's exactly what I do, try to switch between pronouns without getting people to notice it. But the problem with specific friend is that their name is composed of a very feminine one and masculine one and always asks to use both so when people hear it it's kind of suspicious
Try writing down what you want to say to them somewhere and then looking it over to decide whether or not you want to actually say it to them. If you don't, just delete it or throw away the paper where you wrote it down.
Those of us with the privelege to be out safely should never forget how many people don't have the same privelege. Out or not, we are all in this together. I just want you to know that I'm proud of you both for how much you care about respecting your friend's identity, and for caring about your own safety! You sound like you are a good friend and hopefully they will be kind and understanding in turn. I wish you the best of luck!
i mean that's what I've tried so far but then there are some specific words that can be easily replaced without sounding suspicious....
valid valid. i hope you find a good solution or have a chat with the friend since it’s upsetting you so much
I'll try that as this is a rather delicate topic. Thanks!
Thanks! I hope so too... I and wish for a future when no one would ever have to do this for safety..."	sz4ciq	trans	202	0.98	2022-02-23 01:25:34
The Times are on an anti-trans crusade, especially against HRT.	"Please use tone indicators! I posted this in r/lgbt as well, so you may have seen this there. 

The Times have recently published a transphobic article on trans youth trying to access do-it-yourself HRT online and their whole take is “but it’s dangerous!” “we need to do something about it!”. (And yes, it is dangerous, but it would be less dangerous if there was actually help in place for us.)

The ”do something about it” in question seems to be banning HRT instead of improving the waiting times for us trans people to access a Gender Identity Clinic. 

The Times article includes a story of Sarah, who’s daughter came out as transgender when she was 13 - she keeps on misgendering and deadnaming her, and didn’t do anything when she came out, and now that she’s 18 she’s gone no contact. This trans girl tried to purchase DIY HRT whilst still living at home & her mother turned off the internet to prevent her from doing it, arguing that she would “regret it ten years down the line”. 

Some parents just aren’t ready to be parents & would rather see their child dead than be happy, and banning HRT will make it WAY more dangerous rather than helping trans youth. What’re your opinions on this?"	"""B-but! It's dangerous!""

You know what else is dangerous for teenagers? Suicidal thoughts.

Now, we have to ask these parents: Do you prefer to see your son in a dress or hanging from the ceiling?

Brutal, I know. But some people deserve to be slapped in the face with some truth.
Literally every medical association supports hrt for minors…
The Times have printed hundreds of anti trans articles over the past several years. At some points it’s one a day. It’s just straight up propaganda.
Well *THAT'S* what you call shitty!
I never really know how to respond to things like this. It's the way they willingly ignore suicide rates and  obvious distress that leaves me speechless. Most of the time their motivations are religious so "" god wants you this way"". No you do because because other idiots like you  use media to apply horrible stigmas to trans people. They're so obsessed with self image that they stop caring about the child in question.  The thing that they think is right to do never is right because regardless that child's truth will come out and that will include the abuse and neglect from homophobic parents, teachers doctors ect. It gets so bad they believe it is wrong for trans people to have rights. I'm sorry this is really going no where because I don't know what to think
It *IS* dangerous.

we *DO* need to do something about it.

&#x200B;

That something is making gender affirming care more easily accessible and less stigmatised. Doubt they mentioned that bit though.
The frightening reality, is the situation in the US is a Mirror of what happened in Germany in the 1930's. Just this time replace the Jewish with LGBTQA (Transgender in particular.). History repeats itself in a different corner and people like in Germany are going to let it happen, since people are too eager to exploit the situation or too afraid of going against the wave.
I’m American and anecdotally it seems like American mainstream media is actually doing a better job of covering trans issues than British mainstream media. It’s weird because I expect American mainstream media to be worse.
Back alley abortuons are dangerous, but if nobody has access to safe, legal abortions, its gonna happen.

Maybe, and this is a WILD idea, we should make these things legal and have tranparent and straightforward pathways for people looking for these services.
It's not just The Times on an anti-trans crusade, The Telegraph are currently engaging in a massive war against Mermaids because ... ... ""Oh can someone support trans children, this is unacceptable."" At the same time, GB News is platforming a teacher who got fired after they treated transgendered teenagers like absolute garbage.

I posted this on the LGBTQ Reddit, and I think that it's relevant to this discussion:

&#x200B;

'I am so sick of these Gender Critical talking points. They pretend that they care for trans kids and ... trans people in general. They point at something like DIY HRT and say that ""it is dangerous, we need to stop this and help these poor people."" But, how are they going to ""help"" trans youth? Are they just going to tell them that it's just a phase that they will grow out off? That they just need to see a counsellor and all of their dysphoria will be cured? I think we all know that these Gender Critical's and their faux ""concern"" are not remotely bothered about helping and supporting trans people, they just want us back in the closet.'
The sad truth is if the parents like this even has a cis child they would find something about them that they could abuse them about. Gay, fat, adhd or not being a blonde. Bad parents will always find a way. 

I am disappointed in the Times. They should be doing articles to point out what trans kids have to go through to get good health care. Fighting for human rights is never wrong.
Fun fact most if not all GPs can prescribe cross sex hormones. I referral to an endocrinologist couldn’t hurt but isn’t necessary. There’s even regular hormone providers who will coach a GP who hasn’t previously prescribed cross sex hormones, in a peer/mentor type of capacity. What I’m getting at it shouldn’t be necessary to access black market type hormones but people are, which is a problem. Not going to lie when I started hormones I was in my early 30s but, prior to that I had looked at prescribing them to myself. So there is an underlying issue there and, I believe it has to do with wait times and the perceived judgment from a physician.
If they outlaw hrt, can we just overthrow them? According to the declaration of independence, it is our duty to overthrow our government if we see their rulings as harmful or unconstitutional.
Content warning

Saying that DIY HRT is dangerous because you’ve removed regulated and medically approved HRT is like saying that coat hangers are dangerous cause you’ve banned safe and clean and necessary abortions
Anyway, there’s a bunch of other stuff that can be used as a (not as good) substitute, that can be bought over the counter or from Amazon.
I completely agree with you. She didn’t deserve to be a parent, especially a parent to a trans kid.
There’s a disgusting amount that would rather see their son hanging, than their daughter’s happiness (or vice versa). I can’t even begin to understand the mental gymnastics to make it make sense. Even trying gives me a headache.
I'm reminded about a doccumentary i saw once where a parent was talking about their late son who had very severe OCD, and eventually ended up killing himself. I don't remember the exact wording but she said something like ""OCD is a disorder that can be terminal"" and that has stuck with me. It seems fitting here.

Sadly, the answer you'd get from almost all of these parents is something along the lines of ""neither"" and they'll continue to refuse to believe that Dysphoria is one of those things that when left untreated, can be terminal. 

It's in a really weird spot where You almost need to treat it like a severe and urgent medical issue to get some of these people to accept that it's not only real, but is something with a very high chance  *That it will kill you* if you leave it ""untreated"". 

But because the ""treatment"" isn't to take medication and get rid of it, but to change other things about the ""patient"" so that it goes away, and the vast majority of people have no frame of reference for things like this (sometimes we forget that most people literally cannot imagine dysphoria (""how do you describe colour to a blind man"" and all that)), they refuse to accept it as what it is: neccesary medical treatment.

For clarity, this isn't to say being trans is some kind of medical issue, it's to say that people with no reference, who don't understand, and never will understand because they can never experience it, need it putting into their terms, and calling it a medical issue, or mental illness is one way to explain it. The problem with that is it implies it's something you get better from, which... isn't true. OR that it implies that there's something ""wrong"" with trans people which... on the one hand, yeah they're suffering and that isn't right, but it's just who they are, it's not ""wrong"" to be like that, y'know?

So we end up left in a sticky situation.

Maybe the solution really *is* to hit them with questions like ""Would you prefer to see your son in a dress or hanging from the ceiling?"" but if they're the kind of people who don't believe mental health is real, or even worse have had one or two minor experiences with mental health issues and believe they've seen as deep as it gets and everyone else is just ""weak""?

I guess the sad reality of it is some parents really will never accept anything other than the normal child they wanted and were expecting.
The problem is alot of people would rather have a dead son than a trans daughter.

Exactly.
Agreed.
It’s disgusting the amount of transphobia and neglect that the youth face. I wish something was done about it…
Agreed, DIY HRT from online is dangerous, however it wouldn’t be a big option if stuff was fixed.
This post is about the UK, where honestly it’s even worse.
This post is about the UK, but I get your point.
I mean theyre both flaming garbage with a few minor exceptions, so...
I think it’s because America is a lot larger, and a lot more of England dislike us.
Exactly this!
Ah I know…it’s disgusting.
It’s a lot harder for teenagers to do that, especially in modern age. But I get your point, and it definitely does have to do with waiting times I agree.
This is in england, so I doubt it.
Definitely. However, it would be a lot less dangerous if things were done about it and not having trans youth rely on OTC and Amazon (unsafe).
Why are you even on this subreddit?
Exactly.

Unfortunately, the tories.
Thing is UK has always been that way from what I heard; the US is racing to be the worse place in the world. Like in less than a year it went from imperfect but more or less safe. To outright insanity and madness of a full-on cult, taking over and not caring about repercussions and potential retaliatory actions and people enabling it because all they care about is remaining in power. US is sheer insanity in the making which is trying to spread and influence Canada into turning as crazy... which they are trying and having some success with all the younger ignorant people that are easily influenced.
I waited six months to speak with a doctor at a clinic that deals exclusively with trans people. I was relatively privileged. My biggest hurdle was worrying about being judged by my family doctor. I can see though if you’re a teen and you don’t have a support system and you risk your family tossing you out.
[deleted]
Sadly.
That’s a bit of an overstatement friend. I know exactly what you’re talking about as I’m down here in the American south, but there are many places where it is the law to murder us. American is bad and getting worse, but it’s not the Middle East or even parts of South America.
The US is definitely a lot worse than the UK, both previously and currently but both appear to be headed in a similar direction and hopefully the correction back to some sense of sanity is soon. Labour in the UK isn’t perfect by any means but is considerably better than the Tories, so hopefully at the next election we can turn away from their shit and dog whistles to earn votes, and with a bit of luck they might realise the majority of the public don’t agree (or at least don’t care) and are more concerned with actual issues.
Thing is, your reply in the context of the post is kinda shitty.

We're not saying that 6yo should have access to hormones. The point is that withholding HRT from your children, when they have the appropriate age for it, is putting their life in danger.
the more i think about it the more i feel like ""unfortunately, the tories"" actually explains a lot of issues in this country... :/

My parents told me I “shouldn’t be making drastic, life-altering decisions until I’m 18” - all I wanted was for them to call me by a different name.	"They say I should “be the person I want them to be” while I’m living in their home, as if I haven’t been trying to do that the whole time. The only reason they even know I’m trans is because my brother outed me to them, so if it weren’t for him they wouldn’t even know. They expect me to open up to them, and then they respond like this when I actually do. They treat me like shit, and then expect me to want to talk to them about anything. Ever since they found out they’ve been watching videos about trans athletes and all the “evil doctors giving their innocent totally cisgender children irreversible surgery before they’re old enough to even think apparently” and they’ve been aggressively misgendering me at every opportunity and then getting mad when I express that it makes me uncomfortable. 

I don’t know, I felt I had to get all this out somewhere. I’m in the car with them right now and I have no one else to talk to. God I hate the summer holidays. I hate how everyone around me gets along with their families and has no problem enjoying themselves while I have to spend six weeks wishing I could go back to school, where at the very least I feel safe."	"I experienced this too. it's awful to hear the people you care about say things like that. as much as it hurt, I had to give my mum time to wrap her head around it and she educated herself on her own. my dad is a different story, but we have good days and bad days. you'll move past this horrible purgatory, and find brighter days and better people to surround yourself with. I can only hope your parents will figure out that they were wrong, and learn what they need to, in order to join you on your journey and the rest of your life <3
Damn I’m sorry to hear that, but who said Family had to be blood? Do you possibly have friends you can go hang with and if your parents don’t understand or don’t want too, it’s their loss. Stay positive 💕
I know and that’s the reason I’m scared to come out. Also, I may be a child, but I can think better than lots of adults can, as evident by the fact that I’m not flat earther
Does anyone else just want to be the living shit out of parents like this? They piss me off so much
I under stand the whole wait till your 18. That would be a rule i would have with my kids.   I have 4. And yea mtf as you would say but if my kids said yeah i wanna change. I would urge then to wait till the 18. Just because its a really big change and its a big one for a child to make with bo life experinces. But i would offer to help and get them ready if they so choose after they turn 18. But yeah. I just dont want them to think they want to then it be too late or have gone to far and would cause broblems with them returning to the way they where if you catch my meaning
Respond like what?
They told you what any responsible adult would tell there child. 
""Do not make any drastic changes until you are 18""....If they didn't care, you would no longer be living there.
Whatever you may do today, can affect and carryover for the remainder of your life. You have just barely begun to live. You are still in the 1st chapter of your life. Trans is not a game or a trend. It's a miserable misunderstood life. It gets better, but you have no idea just how difficult it is. Alot of individuals change what they feel by 18 or 19 yrs of age, while some don't and age becomes a pretty good sign you are needing some professional advice and help.
Don't get hung up on caring parents or pronouns, like I read about many who do. If it turns out you are truly Transgender, trust me, HE/SHE is the least of your battles
Honestly, I hope you’re right. I don’t want to have to cut myself off from them entirely but sometimes I really feel like they don’t want to bother to educate themselves or listen to my point of view. 
Thank you for your words of encouragement, though. I really needed that today :)
Yepppp
Blockers at least, and social transition would be cool by me. But I guess I'd be a better parent than you and OP's parents
All OP asked their parents for, was use of different pronouns and name, I fail to see how their parents reaction is in any way appropriate, and how you think it is. This isn't a drastic change, its something for their own mental well being. And if you were able to not care about pronouns, or parents caring about you, good for you, but it does affect a lot of people, hell even cis people hate being misgendered, and when your own parents, people who are supposed to care for you actively do it, it hurts.
I understand holding off surgery, but I never said anything which even related to that. I wanted my parents to use the name and pronouns I feel comfortable with - there’s nothing drastic or life changing about that. And believe me, if I thought this was all just a game or a trend I certainly would’ve given up on it by now.
Ya know, I’m a little older too but just because we went through a lot of bullshit doesn’t mean every trans person should have to.  Your experience is not representative of every trans person - I for one would have loved to have the option to begin transition and delay male puberty when I was a kid.  Would have saved countless hours and thousands of dollars in expense to get even mediocre results.

In OP’s case, they’re simply talking about using a different name.  Sounds like it’s the parents that are jumping to conclusions based on negative media around trans people.
Blockers at least, and social transition would be cool by me. But I guess I'd be a better parent than you and OP's parents
I remember how it feels and what I needed someone to tell me, I just hope you guys can find a way forward :)
Like i said nothing that would not be reversible.

Did you not read my response or the thread at all?
I agreed with the parents stating ""Do not make any drastic changes, until 18""....
What part of that do you disagree with. Don't go into any great detail about something I didn't say, tell me what is wrong with the parents request.
My comment was only regarding there response that you wrote.
""DONT MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES UNTIL YOU ARE 18""
That's all I was referring to. There calling you by he/her wasn't anything I mentioned. I agree with there comment. I've lived it, I know.
The pronoun thing will be a ""You"" thing most of your life, if you allow it to be. You will find it's annoying but the least of your battles going forward. Don't look to be offended because it will make it harder on a situation that's hard enough. I wish you the very best moving forward. 
Think everything through and get the best advice possible. Listen to more than one side, and do not hate those that just don't understand. Parents are important, and right now the most important thing in your life. Give them time, give yourself time. They love you and just want the best, keep that in mind
I poked around their comments on other things, they're a Republican, so honestly. Not super surprised by their stance on respecting parents and all that after seeing that.
There we go, now it's comprehensible. I'd disagree, if a kid's got a diagnosis of gender dysphoria and made it very clear that their gender does not match the one assigned at birth from a very young age then medical transition should be allowed. For some people transition is the only way they see to stay alive
Can you please re-write the second sentence. It's not only soporific, it's barely human in its structure. I've understood a cat's meow better than that sentence
Ya know what, gonna be blunt. Cause its fucking stupid, what can someone do before being a legal adult without a guardians permission? Seriously tell me. I got the same thing from my parents at 19, so its obviously not something told to only people under 18. So unless OP can somehow trick a Social security office worker into thinking someone else is their parent, their legal name isnt changing. Usually need a parents permission to set up everything to go through the arduous process of getting on HRT. Surgery, falls under the same umbrella of issues as HRT, but even worse.


If you can give me even one drastic change that is realistically achievable while still a minor, I will be absolutely amazed.
Who the getting easier brick?
Yeah they seem like an idiotic ""I struggled so you must also"" type of individual. Best ignored and downvoted.
Ok so how old are you. This would be a person by person. Not a group. Not everyone is the same. You at the age of 18 are not set in stone nor will you be the same person at 21 that you where at 18. Life changes. I wouldn’t want my kids to make a choice they could not undo. Thats what im saying. Now as to present as the other that fine by me. Just dont want them to make a bad choice.
Wow you know you lost when you go after grammar
One drastic change

""MATURITY""

Don't preach to me about this, it's difficult to take it seriously. I've got children, a mortgage and I'm a business owner. I came from a time when ""TRANSGENDER"" wasn't a word yet. When it could not be talked about and there was no one available to help in any way. Decisions were made without support or guidance. Wrong ones as well as good ones. Denial and hiding for the majority of my life.
But since I've lived it, and survived it, I've got a pretty good grasp on the right way and the wrong way.
What you think you know, you don't, and what you know, you can't be sure of at a young age. Parents see this, simply because they were young long before you. Don't hate because you feel offended, no one like to be told no ...It's good solid sound advice. ""DONT MAKE DRASTIC CHANGES UNTIL YOU ARE 18""....I'm betting the parents pay, clothe and support 100% of her existence. There child's best interest is in mind. Don't confuse love and caring with hate and disrespect.
1. My age is irrelevant and it's disclosure poses a security risk. 
2. The only one who knows what's best for a kid is that kid, not parents, not a psychiatrist, the kid.
No I just literally have no clue what the hell your sentence means
\>Ever since they found out they’ve been watching videos about trans

yes, because this is definitely the behavior of loving caring parents... who want the best for their child.... yeah...  


i hope the dripping sarcasm came through  


on another note, just because they clothe you and feed you, doesnt make them good parents, it means they manage to meet the bare minimum, if that. and that isnt even something i came up with, i got that from my father, regarding his parents, so you cant say that one is an immature stance.  


also, just so ya know, i think you misgendered OP in there
Point said. Kid.  And as for age its shows.

I see you are hung up on things that you and i can not agree on. I'm sure you know better and can't be told different. I genuinely wish you the best and live the life meant for you to live. Have a great week 😊

I JUST GOT APPROVED FOR HRT!!!	May has always been my favorite month, not just because it's my birth month, or because it's Asian History Month, but because of how much joy May has always brought me. I got a call from my endocrinologist this morning telling me he's sent in a request for testosterone to my pharmacy and i'll be starting T this week!!! It's been such a hard past few weeks; my rat passed away, I came out to my parents and they're unaccepting and continue to misgender me, and work has been so unbearable.

A nightmare almost came true	On sunday I had a medical emergency where I was barely keeping conciousness and could barely talk. I was only in my underwear and had to gonto my neighbours to call the emergency number. When they came they kept misgendering me and I was literally powerless to correct them so meanwhile I was scared for my live going in and oit of conciousness I kept getting misgendered even after I gave them my proper name. I don’t remember too much but them misgendering me is most of what I remember. I was scared that in my last moments I would be misgendered and that’d be the last thing I’d hear. So I got broken both physically and mentally there. My dysphoria has been extra strong since. Thankfully last night I had enough energy and conciousness to put on makeup and that helped a lot. But it’s still glued to my mind being strongly misgendered. I don’t even care I was accused of overdosing. I just wish I looked more feminine so I wouldn’t be misgendered before I kicked the bucket.	"That’s horrible, im so sorry.. i cant even imagine what that must feel like..
Would you like a hug?
I am so sorry. How are you doing right now honey? Sending virtual love and hugs your way.
I'm sorry you were misgendered but glad you are well enough to post here. Hopefully you've fully recovered physically and the dysphoria calms down.
Oh my god I’m so sorry… stay strong queen
I'd love a hug
I got some bad news today, but I'm staying hopeful. The hugs are highly appreciated
Thank you <3.The dysphoria has calmed down thankfully but I'm going to need to go through tests to make sure there's nothing in my brain or heart.

I got misgendered at pride	I don't know how to not care how people see me. I don't know why it stung so much. I'm used to it, you know? I get misgendered all the time, I try to speak up. Sometimes people understand, sometimes they choose not to, they choose to ignore it, maybe they just don't understand. I know I don't pass. It's hard for me to leave the house every day, dysphoria creeps in every morning. I almost didn't go to pride, bc it's so hot out and I couldn't wear as many layers as usual. I tried to not worry about what I looked like too much.. I figured if anyone would understand, it'd be people at pride. And.. I don't know. It wasn't that I was misgendered so much as that when I spoke up and corrected them, they ignored me. I keep trying to tell myself they didn't hear me, you know..? But I just can't shake the sinking feeling in my chest, the lump in my throat. I feel so stuck in my own body. I'm so tired of having to correct people. I want to not care, I don't want it to hurt so badly. I feel like it shouldnt matter what anyone else sees.. because I know who I am. But it does matter, and it does hurt and I don't know how to deal with that.	"Oh I’m so sorry to hear that! Nothing stings quite as much as someone in your community not recognizing the struggles that are familiar to everyone in it. Being kind is hard and in the days when the people around you aren’t kind, that’s when you need to be the most kind to yourself
Misgendering is like a shot to the heart, it hurts at your core, especially when it's unintentional. Because it means they are not reading you the way you want to be read. It gets you thinking, is it me or them? Dysphoria kicks in, anxiety, anger, frustration, self-doubt it's hard. I'm with you and I'm sorry you had to go through it, especially at pride.
When I first started on hormones, I still presented male because I wanted to wait until I developed more feminine. I had purchased a pin of the trans flag with She/Her on it. I still got misgendered every single day. I kept quiet because I was too scared to correct them. Only if someone asked about the pin, I'd tell them that it was my preferred pronouns. But for the most part, people just misgendered me. I felt miserable and cried a lot. Especially when I thought back to how excited I was when I got my pin. It was going to be my way of coming out to everyone without having to actually tell/explain to them. But, nobody paid no never mind. Nobody cared. I know how much it sucks, and I know how much pain it can cause. But in time, with patients and persistents, you can get to the point of passing and being seen as the person you really are.
name and pronouns to affirm gender?
Sorry you had this experience 😔 I was too afraid to go to Pride today out of fears of not belonging and getting misgendered, so I went to visit my parents instead and ride my motorcycle as I’ve been severely anxious and depressed this past week. I hope it gets better for you OP ❤️
 Me too. Are you a trans man?
*Sending virtual comfort support hugs*
OF ALL PLACES
I'm sorry you had to go through that 😢
You as well
Sometimes it happens more in queer spaces because people don't know whether to read you as queer/GNC or trans depending on what you're wearing. If I wear a dress I get read as a GNC man more often than I'd like in queer spaces, but baggy jeans and a big Hoodie I get read as a cis female more. It's weird. 
  
Sometimes the lgbts are pretty bad at asking for pronouns too
Thanks. It was definitely a hard time that felt like would never end. I couldn't see things getting better but, eventually they did and continue to do so."	vflyzw	trans	187	0.99	2022-06-19 03:11:32
Got Publically Misgendered in front of a crowd of 50+ Yesterday, so that was fun.	"The long-short of it: I was at an event where a speech was given about my dad and how amazing he is (I personally think so, too) and the speaker was a good friend of his (basically family to us). He has always shown me respect and honest curiosity about my gender, but he called me a **""son""** to a relatively large crowd. Up until that moment, basically everyone there (to whom I knew 1/5 of) either did not recognize me or thought I was a random girl (even family! Only my grandparents recognized me right away).

I had to leave shortly after because everyone who didn't know me either couldn't stop staring in that infamous unwelcomed stare (as if my existence was a personal insult to them) or weren't helping the confusion which caused more of it. 

That's it, that's the story. Thanks for listening :)"	"That's shit and you're allowed to feel shitty. I'd tell him that was shitty of him. Sorry I said shit so much
I'd definitely tell him off for that. That's absolutely not cool.
Omg that just feels like it would cut deep. I truly feel for you. I've been transitioning for 9 months now and just found out this weekend that my mother has told zero family about me. So I really can understand.
I'm sorry 😔
That's horrible... Hope you feel better now
Thanks! It was just *slightly* embarrassing
I left, but I asked my mom to mention something and she’s generally pretty stern imo
Yeah, that definitely happened early on for me. The whole ""well we wanted *you* to tell them when you were comfortable"". Ended with a ""No, no. Just tell anyone who calls me a man/boy/son/dude/sir that I'm not one."" and I know they did/tried. 

My family knows, they just have *rarely* seen me that femme.
Thanks. It sucked but this is more of a ""we got through it"" story :)
I do. I don’t let this stuff ruin my day but it was a bit nerve wracking to be in such a populated place
Slightly? This sounds horrifying.
This will sound morbid (maybe?) but I'm too used to this level of BS so while yes I was uncomfortable, it wasn't going to ruin the rest of my day.
Completely understandable. Glad you didn't let it ruin your day. I wish I was that strong. 💖"	rez55z	trans	178	0.99	2021-12-12 21:46:32
I started a new job at a restaurant this week, and one of the waitresses saw me get distressed when I was being misgendered at the host stand, so she took it upon herself to update my name tag. It’s wonderful working somewhere inclusive.		"I love your coworker.
Omg yesss!!
Also like this looks like either a book cover or a film cover and it's an amazing photo, you go girl!
Good coworker.
Thanks, but you exaggerate :)"	be1n08	trans	180	0.99	2019-04-17 00:55:29
"Got ""misgendered"" today... while in AGAB mode."	"I was called miss while in boy mode. I haven't even begun to take hormones! WTF? 🤨

This was so unexpected I didn't even get the chance to enjoy it 😕

But I don't mind that mistake getting repeated... ☺️"	"Task failed successfully
Happened to me too bout a year ago, its the reason i started questioning in thecfirst place. N now im here being the lil queen i was born to be ^-^
This has happened to me lmao it’s amazing
It's not just, how you look, but also how you behave, speak and move that make other perceive you as female. :)
Happened to me a year ago at SeaTac, even before I thought of trying to present fem. I was looking for “restrooms” and one of the greeters directed me to the ladies’ room 🙂. That was when I realized I even had a chance at transitioning.
Similar thing happened to me the other day! I put no effort into my appearance and went to get groceries, but I was wearing a pastel colored long sleeve t-shirt. As I entered the store I was literally thinking about how much effort it would probably take to pass, but when I got to the register the cashier was like, staring at the floor so I asked, “are you open?” And he before looking up he responded, “Yes ma’am.”
Made my day lol, I guess I just give off “ma’am” vibes :)
lol 😂
I haven't changed a thing."	n3qi4j	trans	180	0.99	2021-05-03 07:37:32
Is it okay to misgender cis people as a form of retaliation/punishment for transphobia/misgendering?	"This is something that I keep seeing pop up as advice for how to handle transphobia. I've never seen it work with people who are genuinely transphobic. I can understand teasing back at someone who is supportive when they slip up if both parties are okay with that. However, when used as a tactic for handling transphobia I've only ever seen it drive a bigger wedge between the person and acceptance. Also, when used as a form of retaliation, it sends a message that it's okay to misgender someone as a punishment. That being gendered and named correctly is a privilege for good people instead of something that everyone has a right to.

That's my take. If you disagree let me know why, because this seems like a very popular opinion on how to handle transphobia.

[View Poll](https://www.reddit.com/poll/tscaid)"	"Nope, never okay. Misgendering isn’t a tool to be used to attack people, it’s just all around a terrible thing to do. It basically considers trans people a joke when doing that. Pronouns and gendering correctly isn’t a privilege, it should be the bare minimum.
It's never ok to misgender someone. Especially not as retaliation or payback or giving them a taste of their own medicine or whatever other rationalization you want to use. That's just ""two wrongs make a right"" thinking, which just isn't the case. Two wrong is just twice as wrong.

The only thing that misgendering transphobes achieves is to convey the message that it's *ok* to use misgendering as a way to attack people you disagree with. Which is exactly the opposite message to what we should be sending.
No, it only reinforces their idea that misgendering is okay. It doesn't further our cause.
not rlly. i get the thought process behind it but it makes u just as bad and them for doing it. the best thing is when they say they identify as xx/xx and i actually use the random pronouns they’ve chosen they just freeze.
Let me answer this question this way 


Do YOU want to be misgendered on purpose as a punishment? No 

So, why would you think others would want that? 

Basic lesson is dont do stuff to other people that your not willing to be done back to you.
The moment you start treating being gendered correctly as a privilege you fight a losing battle for acceptance
I’ve always believed that it’s almost karma based. I know that I’m respecting their identity as much as I can, and I hope me showing them respect can at least make them think about how they were wrong for not respecting my identity. Everyone has a right to be themselves, and it shouldn’t be that hard to respect that.
I'd like to say it's not cool. Specifically online, it's just not worth it. But honestly I feel like once I'm fully transitioned, if my mom keeps calling me her daughter I'm gonna either start calling her my dad if I'm unable to block her out of my life completely
misgendering a cis person is not as harmful to them as it is to misgender a trans person. however, that is WHY misgendering a cis person in retaliation is not a good idea. they don't understand what is so painful about being misgendered, because to them, the idea of being the 'wrong' gender is just a laughable concept and not something they've agonized over for years. so when they get misgendered, they don't feel that pain, and they're more likely to just be like, ""see? it's not that bad. you're overreacting. get over it.""

plus it reinforces the idea that being referred to with the correct pronouns is something you have to 'earn' with good behavior.
Look, if a stranger is going out of their way to misgender me, they're going to do it regardless whether or not I return the favour. Karma or positive vibes is a nonsense excuse to not defend yourself. Reflecting their behaviour back onto them is more constructive than hoping karma magically transforms them.
Certainly not
Unfortunately, this doesn't help your cause. If they are not offended by being misgendered then they will assume it's no big deal to you either if you're willing to stoop to their level.
No. No. No. No. pronouns and names are not something that get to be “revoked” at any point by any person. Doesn’t matter the context.
Being reactionary without furthering thought provoked discourse is never the way. Being offended sucks, but offending back just perpetuates a cycle of negative, and childish, behavior.  
  
  The best thing you can do is keep it light. If they've misgendered you accidentally, just casually remind them of your preferences. If they don't seem to care enough to try after this, then you have to decide if you want to be around that person in the future. There are lots of transphobic people, but also tons of chill people. Surround yourself only with people who have similar core values.  
  
  I have decided not to claim any gender for myself so nobody can ever be wrong. He, she, they.. even ""it"", will all remain applicable because I simply choose to exist, and nobody can turn that against me.
It doesn't solve anything, it's just a way to be rude to them. A lot if trans people find it funny, as it can really upset transphobes. So im not going to tell them what to find funny, nor am I going to bat for transphobes.

But it damn sure won't change any minds, nor is stooping to their level very respectable.
Absolutely not. I want to treat everyone with respect as to who they are and if I have an issue with them then I will call them out on those terms. I think the use of misgendering cis people only undermines and harms our arguments, and can even be harmful and triggering to our trans siblings particularly sensitive to seeing misgendering. Everyone is the gender they experience on a fundamental level and shifting the goalposts on that as some kind of retaliation only muddies that water.
I agree with you 100% it bothers me to no end that people act like it's okay to do that. It puts you on the same level of transphobes. Everyone deserves to have their names and pronouns respected no matter who they are
Bigotry doesn't become justified by the behavior of the person you're directing it towards. You want to insult someone, do it the old fashioned way.
I would say no because it's not okay to misgender ANYONE, but also no because it can enter really nasty territory when you start misgendering marginalized cis people, especially cis poc, who often experience de-gendering due to not meeting the eurocentric views on gender and beauty. There are much better ways to combat transphobia imo.
It's never ok to be mean.
whether you think that it's okay or not, I just find that its often just not effective as a retalliation to transphobia, if its between supportive friends then I don't have a problem with it but as a ""gotcha"" tactic it doesn't really ever work
It only gives legitimacy to them doing the same if we're using it as an insult to the cis, intentionally or not.
I say no because we don't like it, why would they? Trying to explain that they should just be nice is a more worthy cause, and if they can't then they don't need to be in your life.
**Short answer:**

No.

**Longer answer:**

It's useful to remember that any actions in excess to compliance are punitive.

You don't ""win"" by being punitive on misgendering. There is no upside. You give up the moral high-ground and you never gain it back. In effect, you invalidate all your own arguments. (i.e. Don't cut off your nose to spite your face.)

So, no, it's never okay to consciously misgender someone as a retaliatory measure.
I know you're all gonna disagree with me but sometimes it *is* eye for an eye. 
At some point it's not about educating them, it's about not taking their shit laying down.

It's just like that crap people say about bullying: ""If you fight back you're just as bad."" 
No you're not, *you're defending yourself.*
The only way to stop bullying is to bully back, give them a taste of their own medicine.
People are just like animals, they won't continue poking at something that hurts them back.

If the situation gets out of control, it's fair game.
If people can’t take back what they dish out then that’ll make them realize that they shouldn’t say it all the quicker.
Absolutely yes if they do it on purpose
Is like punishing hitting with hitting.
Feels like the type of thing that's just never gonna hit them as hard as it hits us. I'm generally in the turnabout is fair play camp when it comes to rhetoric (with some exceptions)  but I don't really even feel like I'm ""winning"" the exchange if I do this.

I also don't necessarily think  it's helpful to try to win these exchanges but I also get the impulse.
Cis people don’t understand what its like to be seriously misgenderes, so they’ll probably just think you’re being reallt dumb if you do eo it. It’s not gonna show them wrong or wven make them feel how you might feel until EVERYONE does it, which they won’t.
So, I clearly wouldn't do it and I think it's a bad idea to normalize misgendering as a punishment. But transphobes don't give a shit about it, they do it with the purpose of hurting us, so I will definitely not be harsh with anyone doing it, it's legit that you want to be mean back.  
If you do it, you're not the one normalizing malicious misgendering, the transphobes did that in the first place. They already think it's okay to do it, and you misgendering them has nothing to do with it.   
My point is: It's probably not ""ok"" in theory, but I will likely stick with you if you do it, they're the ones to blame, not you
I’ve done this a lot in the past, but it was always a knee jerk reaction. I kinda just get away/ignore those kind of people now. Its not worth my time or mental sanity to deal with that.
Two wrongs don't make a right.

An eye for an eye makes the whole world blind...

People hurt you, so you hurt them? That makes you a bully too...just joining the very abuse and trauma culture that created intolerance and lack of acceptance for others or ourselves in the first place.
absolutely not
No because it gives them a reason to keep misgendering like ""you misgender people too on purpose"". Meanwhile i think it's okay when trying to put them in our shoes. 
My partner used to purposely misgender his teacher with her consent any time she misgendered the other trans guy in the class, and this helped her empathize and improved in not misgendering him anymore. 
But I repeat, she gave him permission, she truly wanted to learn. 
Another one is when talking to children, when they misgender someone and they don't understand why it isn't nice you can just say ""would you feel comfortable if I start calling you *misgender*? ""
An eye for an eye makes the world blind.
Double standards
only on very rare circumstances imo

as a cis ally (i know, sorry for being here, but I wanna make people happy) i hate being misgendered but at the same time i would rather die than be transphobic
I want to say yes but it truly isn't. 

I've misgendered cis people in jest to prove a point but not openly pushed it continuously. Usually if someone says ""Who cares about pronouns etc"" ill be like ""yeah spot on sis"" and they respond with ""im not a girl"". 

Conversation goes on from there with me going "" okay so you do care about pronouns and how your referred to...."" And have a good convo
I say it’s not. But I must say I have done it out of anger. I’m definitely not proud of it. 🥲
Doing it continuously doesn’t seem like a good idea but ive done it briefly as a direct response to being misgendered and honestly it got my point across effectively

(Edit: I do wanna note this was in 8th grade and the interaction basically went like this: Transphobic kid misgenders me to the lunch lady while we’re both in line, I call him “she” to the same lunch lady, he’s like “did you just assume my gender,” I point out that’s what he does to me, he’s like “oh.” A couple years later we see each other again and he earnestly asks me my pronouns)
I will show others the exact same level of respect as they show me. If someone intentionally misgenders me, I will misgender them in return. They don't warrant my respect in that regard. Once they respect my gender, I will respect theirs. Its very simple. This goes for most things I do.
Only if you are trying to make a point about it being wrong
My sister today actually dead named me because I made a joke she didn’t like and then yelled at me why it was ok to do that…
Honestly there’s enough hate in the world, I’m not going to spread anymore. I’d rather be the a person who treats everyone with kindness and respect. If the situation ever gets to an unbearable degree I’d simply remove myself from that situation and not surround myself with hateful people! At least that’s my two cents.
The thing is it just doesn't really work as well. It's also a double standard thing, if you don't have any material to go at them don't say anything
No, we do not go down to their level.  
We'll always have the moral high ground.

No need to insult someone back. Keep your dignity and win by being the better human.  


Have I done it with my mom once? Yeah, but she asked why I was so adamant about using proper name/pronouns and said she didn't understand. So I asked her if I could show her to which she agreed.  
The first few minutes she didn't mind, the next 2 hours she was annoyed and when I continued the next day she was visibly upset and said she gets it now.
Naw it’s not right to misgender them because that would be counterintuitive and most of the time they’ll just laugh it off just to spite you. Better to just to treat them like a child every chance you get. Like be nice to them but if they wanna act like they’re too stupid or lazy to use the right pronouns then treat them like they’re stupid and lazy.
I answered with depends, but I meant to put ""no.""
Rise above the haters
A) Even if they care that you do it won't change them

B) Generally they aren't going to care much

C) It doesn't solve the problem which is their lack of education

&#x200B;

EDIT: D) it's blatantly hypocritical
I have definitely experienced a context where it was legitimately ok. In the course of trying to explain what misgendering is and how it feels to cis people, I've had a few who didn't believe me and a few who wanted to experience misgendering so it wasn't just conceptual. I ask if they'd be ok with me misgendering them at least for a period of time and if they say yes I do
Relation like that benefits no one involved. You should rise up and be the bigger person. It would actually probably hurt what you are trying to do and not help it
I want to make a whole video about this one day because I see people also misgender people who are bad or aren't taken seriously, or show some kind of mental illness, biggest people latley being Trisha Paytas, Demi Lovato and Chris Chan. 

The thing is that if in society we choose who is valid, it tells people it's ok to choose who gets to be respected and who doesn't, which is really bad. At the end of the day gender is a social construct, I'm not a psychiatrist and can't diagnose people and using the proper pronouns for someone is not going to kill me
That’s completely hypocritical
If you misgender a cis person as a punishment, all it does is show them that correct pronouns are a privilege that can be taken away.
It's never ok to blatantly misgender a cis person IMO but maybe just to show them how it is to be closeted and trans you could ask them how it would feel to be called and treated as another gender that isn't their own.
No. I think we've all got to try and rise above. You basically destroy any sort of safe space for LGBTQ+ people, including you, at that moment. 
If someone were intentionally misgendering me, I'd definitely have to check my anger and the need to retaliate... but that's what that person wants, to stir me up, disrupt my center. So don't let them. Restate pronouns. If they choose to continue to misgender, ignore them. ""Oh were you talking to me? You should probably use my correct pronouns if you want my attention."" And then remove myself from the situation if possible. Or just choose to keep thinking smarter as things progress. 
They want to give you anger, so don't let them. You don't have to accept it and you definitely don't need to continue spreading it.
Despite me being against it, sometimes I need to hold myself cuz I want they to understand how painfully annoying misgendering is, but I don't think it would bring something positive at all.
It's not, i know it's not but I'd do it to make a point. (Happened once and asked them if they felt okay with me referring to them as some random pronouns since they refused to tell me their pronouns. They were ""confused"" about enbies using they/them.)
im of the opinion that you shouldnt do that as an actual weapon in any capacity, id say using it as an example like ""ok mom but would you like it if i called you a man constantly"" or something like that to see if it would upset them, but not flat out misgendering them constantly/unironically
Never make someone's gender conditional on perceived ""good behaviour"".
No it’s not a way to punish people
I think the idea of making cis people familiar with the feeling of being misgendered could be useful, but at the same time the fact that it sends the wrong message is a really good point. I don't have a good anwer, beyond that I personally choose not to because I reckon it's better to go for not misgendering as long as I'm unsure.
The problem is that by doing it, you're basically saying that it's a valid tactic to misgender people you disagree with. Guess who has more to lose in that eventuality...
No, cause then your just on the same level as them and your no different. It's not a privilege to be revoked when angry, it's the bare minimum that should be respected
I voted situational but I think after reading all the conversation here it's probably not a good idea. So thanks OP for educating me a little more =)
That's just petty. Treat people better than they treat you.
Be the change you want to see in the world.
Tbh if they purposely misgender me i am gonna misgender them as well
Idgaf if it’s right or wrong, if they’re doing it maliciously then I’m doing it back with a smile on my face and in a polite voice. That being said it rarely ever happens to me
DO NOT! I REPEAT, DO NOT EVER MISGENDER ANYONE FOR ANY REASON. DO YOU KNOW HOW SHITTY THAT MAKES PEOPLE FEEL ABOUT THEMSELVES??? EVEN IF THE PERSON IS CIS AND MISGENDERING SOMEONE, DONT DO THE SAME THING TO THEM. THAT WILL ONLY MAKE THEM THINK ITS OKAY TO DO WHEN YOURE ANGRY AT SOMEONE!!!!!
my take is if you can choose between being mean and not being mean choose not being mean
Yeah I think it can be funny tbh. I wouldn't do it if I was having an actual converstaion with someone but if I'm at the point where they are just amusing me with how stupid they are then yeah absolutely I'm gonna tease the shit out of them. Like I wouldn't use it as a serious point but if it was obvious that I'm just making fun of them then yeah.
If its specifically the Situation where person x misgenders me, i think its okay to misgender them back if asking them to stop doesnt work.
Yes, yup, yep, 100%. I know I'm probably gunna get down voted, but I'll eat the karma... If someone is going to purposely come at me in a way that is obviously intentionally harmful, then I'm gunna retaliate. I pass well enough now that I'd say pretty much most times I get misgendered it's intentional with malice, and when it's not it's obvious enough. I'm not gunna just stand there and look pretty while someone is being bigoted towards me. I have no obligation to be nice, or accommodating, when in all reality anything I say or do isn't even likely to change their mind in the slightest!
Live and let live. Unless they are the aggressor. Then it's about comedic timing.
no. and i hope all the people that voted yes have a horrible life. do not misgender anyone. if you misgender someone ""because"" they misgendered you, you aren't doing a good thing. even if it doesn't matter to the cis person. it is like responding to bigotry with bigotry. which you should never do.
On behalf of a user keeping a low profile who messaged me. More than happy to do this for anyone who doesn't want to comment with their profile for any reason, so long as it's relevant and respectful.

""Ask ""Why did you do that!"" the response they give will be vary. But ask a few times and if you can, before you leave their presence, state loudly ""I didn't do anything to disrespect you, why would you disrespect me?""

The assertion here is that you are a woman. They disrespected a woman and for no apparent reason.

Personally, I just take it on the chin most days. But saying, that if you have to say anything at all, this is the way to handle it. Because they can't escalate and make it worse. And it's exactly what a woman would say. Not a trans woman, but a woman.""
If I think it would make them realize how hurtful it is then sure. But just to get back at them? Nah I’m not a fighter and I prioritize my physical safety over winning an argument so I don’t rlly care for their opinions or motives
It's pointless, since they don't give a f*** about it and even they'll laugh at you for being so naive.

Possible situation and your response could be (be careful):

_oooh! So you're a man?? Wtf, if you don't tell me I'll never guess!

_oooh! So you're an idiot?? Wtf, if you don't tell me I'll never guess!
This is pretty funny, i would laugh if someone used this against me :D
If you just randomly did it then it would be wrong but if you are doing it as a literal example to someone of what they should not have just done to you then I would never have a problem with it. I never look at someone being victimized and think ""you should be a better victim"".
It's never just as bad lol. A trans person misgendering a transphobe is clearly punching up.
I’m glad to see this thread and the comments about it never being OK.

If I ever get intentionally misgendered, I will now not respond by misgendering them back, but by asking “how would you like it if I called you sir/ma’am”
We should never punish others how we ourselves fear being punished.
Wow jeesus the amount of votes okay with this... wow y'all. Wow.
[removed]
Lmao absolutely the people saying not are just too pussy to stand up for themselves. You should definitely do it back. And walk away after if they persist, knock a hoe out.
theres racial implications to misgendering east asian men and dark skinned women of colour so id rather not
My mom isn't using my preferred pronouns and name for not wanting to talk to her 24/7
People who misgender on purpose need to be educated. Returning the treatment is a cruel form of education. But it is reaching.
NOOOO I clicked the wrong thing!!!!!
The only time I use it is to be eye opening. If someone says they don't care about pronouns and hate that trans people do, or say they don't use pronouns, using the wrong ones can be eye opening to how important they are
I’ve only done when people deliberately misgender me as a form of mocking and insulting. When I do it I do it to teach them a lesson on how it feels and not in spite. I give people 3 chances before hand though. Thankfully the last time I did it was 5 years ago.
I always say I should but when the time comes i just can’t do it
i chose yes but i thought more and im changing to depends . i feel like sometimes people need a kick of reality . i wouldnt do it obsessively and only if the person is showing willful ignorance and being mega fake and obviously is misgendering behind the scenes . my moms been thinking that if my principal deadnames me again shes going to call him roberta and such to give him a lesson . its probably bad but i like the idea . 

hes clearly transphobic as the new vice principal misgenders me constantly despite me only going by he/him this year and hed be the only one misgendering me considering the rest of the teachers dealing with her in relation to me are supportive . he also still deadnames me after over a year . 

misgendering wouldnt do anything for some people and just add fuel to the fire but it some cases it might bring them a bit more into reality and show how their actions can be harmful
When my friend misgenderes me, I call him a furry instead.
If the misgender was maliciousIy intended only….I feel that the only way for a chance for the empathy light to go on is if they feel that pinch in their heart when someone mis genders them for once.
If they do it on purpose as a bullying tactic, yeah. If they say pronouns shouldn't matter and we're just sensitive, yeah let's see them ignore it and not be ""sensitive"" about it. For God's sake misgendering someone's dog can get you yelled at more than misgendering a trans person
Its never okay. If theyre a bad person it has nothing to do with their trans-ness and therefore misgendering is just an excuse to be transphobic. Also justifying transphobia in certain situations leaves the door open to justify it in others. If theres a bar at all it can be moved, so the best answer is to just say transphobia is never okay.
Nah they deserve worse
There's no right to equal treatment in the wrong
Even if it feels bad to the target, that'll just be more evidence that you're bad because you want to ""lie about people's genitals"".
If you’re a person of color I’d say to call them a historical figure of the opposite gender. Like my aunt keeps deadnaming me so imma call her that George Washington
Exactly, the only argument that I keep seeing in support of it is, ""if they won't respect me I won't respect them."" That's not the point. Transphobes aren't going to stop being transphobic because you misgender them or call them by a different name. All they think is, ""haha, triggered trans person.""
To play devil's advocate, wouldn't it help conceptualize to them how it feels though? Like a lot of transphobes complain we care too much about pronouns, whilst at the same time would probably lose their shit if they got misgendered. Perhaps it could be a good tool to go, ""see how it feels? Can you now understand why misgendering is harmful"".
That's exactly my line of thinking but so many people keep giving the advice to misgender transphobes in retaliation. When I point this out under a comment recommending it they entirely miss the point.
Also misgendering doesn't really effect cis people due to their stable gender identity
I like this
Yeah why would we put ourselves on their level? Be mature.
Unless it’s (TW) >!animal abusers!< or >!sexual harassers!< Then we are more than mean to them :)
I get what you are going for with the bullying analogy but it's kind of apples to oranges. Not to mention that bullying a bully only works when it's physical in response to physical. If it's verbal bullying, retaliation only spins into an insult tennis match which, on top of not solving the problem, is childish. I actually love that you brought this analogy up because it'll be easier to put why I disagree into perspective.

The entire reason bullying a bully back works is because you are using the same tools and no one wants to experience the effects of those tools. It's a punch for a punch. Once the bully knows you'll punch back they'll stop. Not only because they don't want to get hit, but also because you can't be looked down upon anymore. You've put yourself on even ground. However, fighting back doesn't always stop bullying. Especially when the victim is smaller and their punch doesn't even hurt the bully. Not to mention some bullies want the victim to fight back because it's a game to them.

The reason being misgendered hurts as a trans person is because we experience it a lot more often than cis people. When it happens to cis people it's usually an accident that's corrected immediately by the wrong party without needing to be verbally cued and then it's laughed about. It's not the same. An ally might feel bad about being misgendered in response to misgendering a trans person, but that's because they have empathy. Transphobes don't. Misgendering a trans person is like throwing a boulder. Misgendering a transphobe is like throwing a pebble. Not only are they not hurt, but like you they make the false assumption that being misgendered is the same whether someone is trans or cis. If they aren't hurt by it they have no reason to believe it actually hurts trans people. We aren't throwing the same punch so they aren't going to stop because we haven't put ourselves on even ground. On top of that, some people just want to hurt trans people. When you misgender them back all they think is, ""Ha, triggered another trans person.""

You're either hurting an ally, making a transphobe's day, or at best making a transphobe angry. Double standards are bad for teaching. If it's not okay to misgender a trans person it's not okay to misgender a cis person. No one takes hypocrisy seriously, especially from ideological opponents.
Exactly!  Every time I have been bullied I have had to stop it by doing the act back to them, counselors do not help.  At this point I will misgender a cis person if they scream my wrong pronouns or name (they do that a lot, homophobic school amiright-)

They deserve it.  It will not stop unless you fight back.
Your opinion is valid and you don't need to apologize for being a cis ally in a trans space. Especially given that the topic at hand has just as much to do with you as it does us. If anything you provide perspective, so thank you for your input. 

It's one thing if there is an understanding between you and the other person, but without it sends a bad message. Being gendered correctly and being called the right name isn't a privilege, it's a right. You don't get to invalidate someone's gender or name just because you're upset. If it's not okay to misgender someone then it's not okay whether they are trans or cis. Double standards is just another way of saying you don't have any. Kind of hard to argue against something you partake in and be taken seriously.
Sorry to hear that. Your name isn't a privilege. It's a right. There's no good reason for that <3
This is the way
I hope people aren't down voting. I started this as a discussion. I want to know why people think it's okay. Maybe there is a pov I haven't heard that provides me with a new perspective. Everyone is entitled to their opinion. Of course, we all lay out our opinions on this matter like they are facts because that's how conversations of beliefs work.

Retaliation is absolutely fine. Insult, ignore, poke at their flaws in logic. I'm not suggesting people don't retaliate when maliciously deadnamed or misgendered. Just recommending not using the same to retaliate. When we do that we frame our names and genders as a privilege that has to be earned and can be taken away as punishment. On top of that, if you advocate that people's names and genders should be respected you've undermined yourself with hypocrisy. If the people telling you something that you are doing is wrong also partake in that activity why would you stop? They should set the example. It's cliche, but be the change you want to see in the world.
that response does not help either as ""idiot"" as an ableist slur. fighting bigotry with bigotry does not help
I realize this, but feel free to scroll and see all the people who think misgendering you has the same effect as it does on trans people.
I've never heard of this. Could you explain further or point me in the direction of a good source to learn?
The thing is it doesn't reach them unless they are supportive and slipped up. It only hurts allies because they have empathy. Transphobes don't empathize with us.
It doesn't hurt them as much though ( at least I don't think so)
If misgendering was the same for cis people as it is for trans people it would make sense as a learning tool. It'd still be hypocritical to employ though which is why it should only be done with people who want the learning experience. If it's agreed upon by both parties it's fine to give them the experience of constant misgendering like some people have said. The reason that method works is because it's not a one off. It's constant misgendering to emulate what life is like for non-passing/non-conforming trans people. It grinds anyone's gears if done long enough, but as a one off response to a transphobe with no intention of learning it doesn't teach them anything. It doesn't sting the same because that one instance isn't compounded with years of misgendering. It's just silly to them, or worse they take joy in knowing they upset you enough to break an ideal that our community believes in.
exactly, I don't think that a single transphobe in the history of transphobia has ever thought ""wow, them misgendering me really made me realize how hurtful misgendering is. I will therefore no longer misgender people"". They just get more angry and their anger and bigotry becomes more justified in their own eyes.
We're not trying to take their rights away though. They are. They are literally trying to kill us, we aren't trying to kill them.  There's a point where tolerating bigotry must stop. I think creating uncomfortable spaces for transphobic  people is key to spreading awareness. If they think they can just say what they want without consequence, I imagine they won't learn anything. 

I'm here for discussion because I fully support and believe in the power of words. Explaing your point to someone who wants to kill you seems to be niave.

Add on: I just don't think a cis transphobic person is going to stop misgendering us because we're more mature
I think there is a difference between being mean and being just. On the other hand, to borrow from Madeleine Albright, there is a special place in hell for those who abuse animals, children, or others over whom they have power. :)
yeah, I suppose so

y'all are great people btw
Thanks it means a lot
I mean, I definitely get your point, and I agree as far as situations where there's a reasonable chance of actually educating someone. But like, real world example, the other day I was at work, a customer and his daughter are looking at products that I'm right next too. So dude looks me up and down, and then stares at my nametag (that has my pronouns) before saying ""He works here, ask him"". At that point it's a safe bet he's just doing it maliciously, so I help them and as I'm leaving, in my guest service voice say ""You ladies have a wonderful night!"" Dude has no audible reaction, and hopefully maybe gained a bit of empathy for how it feels, at least, that's my goal. I'm not saying it's necessarily correct of me to do so, but like I said earlier, most cis people probably don't even know what it's like to get misgendered...
Gamer moment: be transphobic
Yeah fair point. I agree now.
They aren't going to stop misgendering us because we misgender them. They don't care about being misgendered. It's either not a big deal or funny because they ""triggered"" us. They learn nothing from being misgendered except that it's okay to misgender people. After all, if the people saying it's not okay to do something do said thing why would people already doing that thing stop. Hypocrisy is one of the Achilles heels of any movement.

No one's saying not to fight back. Insult them if you want. I simply ignore them until they get it right. When they try to enact laws that are transphobic, rally, petition, get out and vote for allies and trans public representatives. I absolutely agree with making bigots uncomfortable. I am loudly and proudly trans and pan. When someone attacks my identity with insults I can out sass the best. When someone says something bigoted or problematic I call them out. What I don't do is invalidate their identity.

 On the note of physical violence, no one here has advocated for taking it lying down. Absolutely protect yourself. If someone means you harm use any means necessary to keep yourself safe.

None of that has to do with the question though. It's a specific question about a specific circumstance. Someone deadnames or misgenders you, is it okay to misgender them back? You mentioned rights. One right that we all are fighting for is the right to be recognized as our gender and to be called by our names. If someone believes it's okay to misgender a cis person in retaliation they have undermined that right. They have taken a right away and framed it as a privilege that has to be earned.
No joke. Part of the reason I only play online games with friends and mute anyone who says something bigoted. Then again, I only play CSGO so I'm not sure about other games communities.
Thanks for your input!
Every gathering of people will have bigots, unfortunately.

My coworker is openly transphobic and I don’t know how to handle it	"To start, I am male presenting and use he/they pronouns. This story doesn’t directly involve me, I just need some advice. Today at work, my coworker (we will call C.)said that she kicked her son (FtM trans who she misgendered constantly) out of the house because she doesn’t support that lifestyle. From what I’ve pieced together, he went to live with his dad and step mom and has a relatively calm life but C. keeps talking about her “daughter/son whatever” and how its ridiculous and kinda gross. 

I don’t know if I should ask her to stop talking about it, try to convince her it’s not a bad thing, or just tell a manager she is making me uncomfortable. What do you guys think I should do?"	"Tell the manager but make sure that you say you want to remain anonymous, she sounds like the kind of person to hold a grudge and get real horrible. I don’t think she will be convinced, probably best to ignore her remarks for now and just tell the manager
Make a complaint to HR or your direct superior. Or both.
If you switch out trans with any other protected class, it makes the hr route easier to think through. 

For example, If you’re a white passing PoC, and a coworker is saying racist shit all the time, it would be unreasonable to ask you to educate them
This is why there is an HR department. I think telling the manager is unwise. That could backfire.
If you think a manager/HR would be supportive, go that route. 

Don’t bother trying to educate her. If she’s willing to kick out her own kid, she’s beyond saving, and not worth your time.
Definitely tell the manager but stay anonymous and try to stay away from her as much as you can
Talk to your HR rep
Me, I would not go to HR. I did that, twice, and it backfired horribly both times.

HR is not there to protect you, HR is there to protect the company. The sooner you realize that the safer you will be.

I would consider your direct manager first - or I would just have a heart-to-heart talk with the offending person and say that that kind of language is not acceptable and that you respect her opinion but you would prefer that she keep it to herself.
Don't listen to anyone saying to tell HR. It doesn't work. HR is there to protect the company. They will betray your confidentiality and screw you over. 

It is impossible to educate a person like this. So really the only option is to make them feel shamed so they shut up. If it comes up again say something like ""if my child came out as trans to me, I would do everything in my power to love and support them. I don't know why you are so proud of refusing to love and support your kid."" You have to walk a fine line where you do not insult them or say anything inappropriate for work but just make them feel overwhelming shame. Most people respond to feelings of shame by putting their head down and shutting up.
If your workplace is honestly transparent and accepting of the lgbtq community then I will approach HR. Possibly another meeting/talk with your manager and the HR. It is very kind of you to feel that way for her son. However; if you think that this may cost you your job, there are other ways to counter act your coworker. This is why I always tell people upfront that I don't gossip. Its very toxic and consuming. Best of luck buddy.
1) tell her to stop talking about that when you're around 

2) if she continues,  tell it to your manager. 

It's not your duty to convince them or anything and it would most harmful to you than to her
You simply shouldn't have entertained her the first time and you wouldn't be stuck listening to her nonsense. You should have simply told her off the first time for being an awful parent and made sure she understood she shouldn't be speaking about that stuff to you. 

As others have pointed out, HR is there to protect the company, not you. If your claims can't even be proven (verbal) you might end up getting screwed. And if it's a small workplace, there is no way they will protect your confidentiality. 

Just set a boundary with her and never interact with her on anything not work related. 

However, if she makes those statements around everyone, and there is proof of some kind or your other coworkers are also on your side, going the HR route can help. But again it all depends on the atmosphere of the workplace.
A lot of people say to go to HR. I did that plenty of times at multiple jobs and it just doesn't work. I would call them out in front of others and tell them that it's disrespectful and downright awful to speak like that. I know a lot of people might say to not confront it but sometimes that's the best option because anyone higher up just might not care. If the HR team/manager cares and is the kind of people to get shit like this taken care of then contact them.
Don’t support the dialogue, tell your opinion and quit on that. Don’t support future conversations about her family. That’s all.
Telling people, HR or whoever it is, is not nice to me. For me it’s like “Mom, he’s swearing”. These things are not cool to me. An adult person should be able to handle situations like that easily without involving others. You can ask her directly. What’s wrong with people not speaking about important things?
If you can’t do that just stay away from negativity of hers.
Tell a manager or hr that's she's being transphobic
I tell people on the spot. I do not agree with their phobias and they can talk that shit somewhere else. It gets around fast that I won't tolerate their intolerance.
Tell HR and DONT ask to remain anonymous. She needs to know that her ignorance is insulting and will cost her the job she has. Make her pay for her transphobia the way she made her son pay.
Coming from someone in management and has dealt with employee issues, and as someone who has had issues with employees:

Do a bare minimum, super duper kind gentle ask for them to stop talking about it, or that it makes you uncomfortable, etc. Make an attempt to have them be aware and fix it. 

THEN, when they continue to be shitty, tell your manager. You can tell your manager that you attempted to resolve it but had to escalate. Managers hate having to deal with these sort of things as it never ends up with anyone happy (including the manager, as they usually have to go to HR or their boss). But the fact that you can tell them truthfully that you tried to fix it gets the manager in your corner. 


Good luck!
Go to HR or a manager and report her. Tell them your coworker is saying things that make you very uncomfortable and fear for your safety.  They should be able to either talk to her and say someone overheard what she said and felt uncomfortable, or if she has a history of transphobic and inappropriate remarks, depending on where you live, she could get fired. 

I had a transphobic coworker who was blatantly transphobic among other things, and I reported her to HR, as well as a few other coworkers, and she got fired because she was a liability to the company (and a horrible person)
You should get a recording of her and then sue the company
America-centric advice follows:

Get a notebook. 

Date the page and write down every uncomfortable interaction, include the time. 

If you make a mistake ~~or accidentally mention your aardvark fursona~~, correct it with a single cross out, instead of scratching out or erasing.

At the end of each day, draw a large slash through the remaining empty space on the page and sign it. 

You are now creating a log of your hostile work environment that will stand up in court. This ""encourages"" to actually create a non-hostile work environment.

Dates. Times. Quotes. Names. 

Then go to HR, and have a friendly, calm chat.
Regardless of the topic, this kind of trash talking and gossiping is wildly inappropriate in a setting like work. I don’t know your workplace rules on transphobia, but even a complaint about disrespectful discussion should shut her down. She sounds incredible self centered and obsessive, I am so sorry you have to deal with someone like that!
Depending on which country your in, if its the UK then that sort of behaviour is not tolerated in the work place and so I would definitely tell your manager. If she wants to be transphobic then she leaves it as the door or learns to be more tolerable.
this right here, best to stay anonymous just in case
True, but it REALLY helps your case when you can tell your boss or HR that you tried. And that really helps as it dissolves a lot of the he said / she said bullshit that the coworker will throw out there as a defense."	sx7o6d	trans	171	0.99	2022-02-20 18:23:48
Somehow my professor still keeps misgendering me, but I feel good today.		"Your prof is an a$$. You got it.
That's not a very professional professor.  You look fabulous darling.
That professor must be blind, because I see nothing but a pretty girl ✨
You're beautiful
Gotta love it when you have your hair down, tight tank top on, high-waist pants, jewelry, makeup, and a purse, and cis people are like “hmmm yeah this screams ‘male’ to me imma use he/him.” 

Like lol no wtf how many signals have to be given out lol
You look good today too. Very cute.
how is that possible???
At the end of the day as an educator is incumbent up on your professor to recognize the difference between identity and gender that he continues to do it implies on purpose and that’s something I would confront him about directly now he could be a Jordan Peterson type and say the problem is you and that  you’re the one that isn’t accepting your pronouns but wait you should say to him same thing I had to say to a few people and that is you know I don’t give a shit about the pronouns because if that’s all it’s about that then I’m not keeping my eye on the right ball but personally speaking that shit, if I start talking you dead shit in the middle of your lectures starting whenever you spoke how long will it take before you decided To say something to me?
You look very beautiful 🌹🌷🌺
What the fuck howwwwwww

It has to be intentional, you read 100% fem to me. I'll bop him
Your so beautiful
Dont let them get under your skin, you look great!!
You truly are and I hope that professor corrects   his mistake
I always  compliment  a beautiful lady

Thank you so so much 💕💕💕 you made my day
Thank you so much I'm blushing 💕
And you're very kind, thank you 💓

Thank you so much you're very kind 💓
I was wearing baggy clothing the first day and he just decided I suppose. It's very religious where I live and people are very rude
Thank you so very much 💓💕
That's nice of you to say, and we can bop him together, as a team >:) 💕

Thank you so so much 💓💕💓

You're welcome
It’s everywhere but I feel I should note that I live in a big city and it’s considerably less bad in big cities.

Also don’t let the internet talk you into believing that every single person who isn’t trans is transphobic, or that it’s sensible to be constantly paranoid/distrustful of people that haven’t yet given you a reason to act that way. Very self-destructive attitude there.
i live in kansas, the bible belt so i feel you
You're very welcome beautiful 🌹🌷🌺
I've asked him to call me the right pronouns, and the fact that he writes me off is hurtful. My school is in a big city. You're assuming so much about the situation based on two bits of text I posted. That's straight up not what I said at all.
I live in Utah, same feels
No I know I’m just sending it out there because I kind of don’t like how paranoid trans Reddit makes trans people and want to PSA as much as possible that optimism can be a healthy thing to embrace
yeah, im doing online but i get deadnamed cuz im a closeted trans boy
I can agree, in big cities it's much better and you have a point, but there is a reason for trans people to be wary of strangers. There's a balance you have to strike. I live in a rural city in Utah surrounded by Mormons who constantly used to tell me that I shouldn't express myself and should bury it. While I tried, I couldn't, and now I can't walk around my neighborhood without people stopping me saying that I should come back to church and change. There are people out there who will shame you or hurt you for being trans, and religion is the motivating factor a lot of the time. Every person has a different experience with their community. You have a point, but it's not a blanket statement that you can apply. My community has proven time and time again that I'm not welcome. When I go to salt lake, I feel much safer. It's situation dependant. Sorry for the long message.
I'm sorry friend, that's truly the worst.

Casual misgendering (CN, obviously)	"Just went to the store. I'm a newtrans and this is one of the few times I've been out in public by myself (when I'm with other people I make them interact with people for me).

Anyway, I'm wearing a pink trans pride shirt. Pink earrings. A pronoun necklace, women's jeans, women's boots.

The cashier just called me buddy the whole time. 

Do I need a fucking neon sign?"	"P.S.: Also I clearly have breasts at this point. They're not big, but they're clearly there. Like come on.
I am not sure on how other people feel about this, but I feel like the term ""buddy"" is gender neutral 

Though, if you are wearing a pronoun necklace, it would be better if the cashier call you ma'am unless the cashier wasn't sure what formal term to call you, so they use the term buddy.
Please don't take it personally.  Perception is a very personal thing. Even if it was a true misgendering, it was from one perspective, only.  Everyone else in the world might see you for who you are.  I've seen cis women that I would have thought were men, or cis men I would think were cis women.

It could also be out of habit.  My boss knows I'm a trans chick, yet still says, ""Yeah, man!"" out of habit.
This has happened to me more times than I can count even with full girl mode on it seems like people go out of their way to misgender me
People are oblivious af. I wear a fucking beard (tho I wear makeup and my binder makes me look like I have small boobs rather than no boobs) and people don't get it.   


And some people eventually realize I'm trans and are really embarassed about misgendering me this whole time so I know it wasn't intentional...
I’m really sorry sis it will be ok I promise
if i get called buddy then i wanna throw hands lol i hate the term in general, even if i was masc presenting i still feel ""buddy"" is a term that evokes the idea you're under whoever is calling you that
I personally call everyone buddy and I doubt the person did it to hurt you, had they intended to made you uncomfortable they probably would have gone with something different. Im sorry that you were uncomfortable with the situation even still, in the future maybe try letting them know that you dont want to be called buddy.
personally, i think being called buddy is fine. dude probably didn’t know what to say. or maybe he likes calling people buddy.
i dont see buddy as a specifically male thing, my dad before i transitioned called me buddy and its one of the few things i enjoy and feel fond of back in the dark ages
Correct me if I’m wrong but how is buddy a masculine term?
the cashier was either transphobic, or used it as a gender neutral term, but either way it still sucks
Buddy, mate, bro, cous, man, guy, I think everything is gender neutral now.
I'm not trying make an excuse for this person, but I feel like the cashier either just calls everyone buddy and its just a personality trait. Or they didn't see the pronoun necklace and thought you were ftm and working on it.
i agree in general that ""buddy"" is usually gender neutral but its important to remember the social context here- as someone who has worked in male dominated industries and who who is AFAB, ""buddy"" is 100% a ""men centric"" greeting when used in the context OP is describing. i cant tell you how many times ive heard male coworkers greet one another as ""buds"" ""bud"" or ""buddy"". i also have noticed that they frequently greet masc customers as buddy or bud as well, but almost never (IF EVER) would tthey do the same for femme or femme presenting customers. just a thought/ different perspective to consider :))
Buddy is definitely not gender neutral. Haven't been hit with a ""buddy"" for a year and a half. It was incessant before that. (i was in boymode while hrt and laser did stuff)
As a trans guy, I never got called buddy before trying to present as male. The first time I realized a stranger correctly perceived my gender was when I got called ""bud"" by a janitor.

The word ""buddy"" in a vacuum is gender neutral, but people usually only call strangers buddy if they're perceiving them as male.
Although 'buddy' has no ties with male gender, some people; for example, the Op; associate it with male.

Some alternatives would be honey, sweetie, or dear. If they make it obvious, like a pin, then it is appropriate to use corresponding terms like sir and madam.
Personally I don’t consider “buddy” to be gender-neutral. It’s something you would say to a guy…
Same here!! I don't know why, it just rubs me the wrong way but I generally feel like it's demeaning. Probably different for other people I just personally hate it.
Once, a pizza guy called me buddy while i was buying my pizza, and then after i bought my pizza i overheard them say to their coworker ""Oh man I'm realizing I just call everyone buddy, I keep wondering if a woman is going to call me out for it at some point"" lol. It was a funny situation for me because I was trying hard to pass as male but probably did not, so it was welcome gender affirmation at first. I think they were trying to use it gender neutrally but realized some women may not view it as gender neutral. Since it was gender affirming for me, I would assume it's probably on the masculine side for sure.
Ah, thanks for the info!
There are definitely some people who use “buddy” neutrally, and I mean I’ve got friends who tell me they use stuff like “bro” and “man” neutrally. But the immediate and social contexts are really what matter, and patterns of behavior are a lot louder than justifications.

In my neck of the woods and the circles I run in, “buddy” “bro” and “man” are all greetings used overwhelmingly by masc peers to refer nigh-on exclusively to masc peers. So I see them all as unambiguously masculine terms, though of course there’s nuance there and not everyone has had the same experience in the same places.

I think my biggest pet peeve with it is peers/friends/coworkers who’ll say they use this or that term neutrally, but in reality you notice they don’t. They use it a lot with “the guys” and they use it with you (“neutrally”, of course), but it’s not something they seem to use for “the girls”. and you’re not omnipresent of course, but eventually it seems clear which group you’ve been auto-sorted into.

Difficult situation ‘cause they typically see no issue, whether it’s due auto-pilot/bias or their very different experiences. Regardless, there’s no way you’re getting them to change that for you when “you shouldn’t be upset, those are neutral terms”. I take my friends at their word, and I trust their intentions. But I know that we’re all human, we’re imperfect, and our intentions don’t always line up with our actions. And sometimes that hurts people whether we realize it or not.

I think I mark this as a win	"Today I had an interesting experience. I was out at Subway with my brother, and out sandwich maker was an old coworker.  I last saw her years before I started transitioning. She just greets me with ""Your dress is so cute hun, what can I get you""

She remembered my brother and started asking him how his brother was.  My brother just points at me and says my sibling is with me. She looks at me for a moment. She responded, ""noyour brother, the one I used to work with.""  My brother just pointed at me and I sorta shyly waved.  Her face lit up so much and she said, ""Oh my god, I didn't recognize you at all. Your so pretty now."" When she was done with our order and the person behind us, she came out and asked to hug me. She thanked me for always being so nice to her when we worked together.

Initial misgendering (because she didn't know) aside, it was such a wholesome encounter. It was also a huge confidence boost to not only get genuine compliments, but to also not be recognized."	"Oh this is absolutely a win! Not only did she not recognize you when you are finally presenting as your authentic self but she remembers your kindness long after you stopped being her daily life. Obviously your true nature was coming out to those around you even when you were not ready to share the whole you with the world. Congratulations for being the kind of person this world needs more of.😍🥰
This an unquestionable win! Points for passing and no hesitation acceptance and love. Can’t blame her for not knowing, and who can say they’ve never had a slow moment connecting the dots? Love that for you
This is such a beautiful story! I’m so happy you were seen in that way 🥰
oh that’s awesome! this makes me so happy. i hope you had a great time and a great day :)
nah that's adorable! genuinely brought a smile to my face reading this :)
Woooow, absolute win for sure! I was grinning ear to war just reading that, I can't imagine experiencing it for myself!

Congrats to you though, I'm so happy for you! 💜😁
Makes me smile :)
That’s so cool!

I wouldn’t even take it as being misgendered because she seems to not have known you were the person supposed to be your brothers brother (does that make sense? No native speaker)
This one made me tear up! Happy for you girl!
I have always tried to be nice to everyone and a hard worker. People have always seemed to really like me or really dislike me. They always seem to remember me.
I think so too. I don't blame her for not knowing. It felt great.
Thank you. I am hoping that this will give others hope. If myself a 6'5"" larger girl can get seen like this. Then so can they.
I did. thank you. I hope you had a wonderful day too. <3
That was my goal <3
I am 6'5"" with broad shoulders. I never feel like I pass. So this was a huge boost. I hope all of us get a chance to feel like this.
That was my goal. I hope this will make your day better. <3
Yea not blaming her at all. <3
Your response reminded me of something my therapist told me. When you put your true self out there for people to see, the people who are doing the same see you and embrace your truth, the people who are putting on a false front see you and it shines a light on their falsehood and they need to distance themselves from the light. It has nothing to do with you and everything to do with them. You keep on being the real you and don't lose any sleep over those who may need to avoid your light. Shine on my friend.😊
I'm 6'1 with broad shoulders as well, not to mention (what at least feels like) an enormous ribcage 🤣, so I very nearly know how you feel.

Throw on my heels and I'm right there with ya 😉 lol
I seem to attract the third kind. The ones who will take advantage of me. I am trying to get better st recognizing it without closing up and becoming too cynical.
I bet your killer 🌶 in heels. <3 I have trouble finding shoes that fit in men's and unisex sizes. 😭  I am saving for a custom made pair.
I mean, not to brag or anything, but most of my ex's couldn't walk in heels to save thier life, I could walk, hell, I could RUN circles around them in heels with no problem, maybe not like the super tall ones, but still 🤣

I'm not sure where you're located, but there's a store called Torrid which has some *fairly* nice stuff at not too expensive a price. Just need to get around the fact that it's a women's Big & Tall store (not that there's anything wrong with being big or tall, just a *little* demoralizing (personally), what I wouldn't give to be able to shop at forever 21 😅).

But they have larger shoe/clothing sizes, with wide options for shoes (idk what the upper limit is, but I was able to get some 11wide heels and boots and they fit practically perfectly). Personally the majority of the store isn't my style (I prefer hot topic type stuff) but they do have some nice stuff and I'll definitely be shopping there more. (Also did this in store, and as you can tell I'm nowhere near passing yet, but the ladies were really nice and helpful, didn't feel judged).
I have heard of Torrid. My ex wife shopped there. I didnt know it was a tall store. My ex described it as for bigger women.  I have 14.5 womens size. Even places that brag about having larger sizes seem to stop at about 13. Then they only have Crocs in larger sizes.

  I love hot topic, but being so tall I couldn't shop there even before I gain weight. They are all sized for mediums and larges.

It is good you had a good experience there. I might have to try it next time I have money to spend on cloths.
Torrid is a godsend I’m 6’1 and a size 16 they have sizes 10 to 30 and i have never been misgendered or belittled in one of their stores and I’m pre everything and live in Oklahoma.
Get iit gurl!
Thanks. That makes me feel good. I usually don't get much more than wierd looks here.  I am actually thankful to have as many openly/actively accepting people as I have met. Espessially in a customer service job."	zy24t8	trans	166	0.97	2022-12-29 10:27:54
Getting misgendered in my dreams	"Every time I have a dream about my life I get deadnamed by pretty much everyone, and I've never had a dream where I had cis guy's body. Even weirder, I don't get deadnamed that frequently anymore irl (I've been out for almost 2 years) so I truly don't know why my brain refuses to let it go. It's been happening so frequently I wonder if I'm really trans sometimes, but it hurts so much I feel like I'm not safe from dysphoria even when I sleep.

Is this normal ? Has everyone had a similar experience ? If so I'd like some tips on how to make it stop."	"It's normal, I experience such dreams very often, and even worse - dreaming of having a really long hair that ends up making me look feminine.
But this only proves you really are trans, these dreams are literally nothing more than dysphoria. 

However, I'm afraid I don't really have any tips, help or suggestions for you. I never quit having them, except the hair one - that one goes away as soon as I get an haircut, lol. 

But at least know this is normal, I'm sure more folks go through this, dysphoria can be a bitch.
Soooo many dreams like that. I've been out for 9 months. What you need to do is not focus about it, and don't worry. Your subconscious is worrying enough that the thoughts pop up during the memory sorting.
I got dream where I got period in front of crowd of people(blood was everywhere) and they started calling me girl so many times and then my grandpa wakes me up
Are me and you the same person? I feel the exact same way, I think it’s normal for this to happen, it can be caused by stress or fear of getting misgendered or perceived as the wrong gender in the future. You’re not alone in this ❤️💕 feel better
You all have dreams? I haven't had a dream in 7 years at least xD
So I'm afraid I can't help you with that 
But I can tell you this
Dreams are memories/thoughts beeing transfered between your brain, so maybe a part of you is afraid others will deadname you so that might be why you dream of that? Might be some anxiety, like I said above some fear or just old memories appearing 
I'm not sure
It's a 50/50 if I present masc or femme in a dream, the masc dreams can be very dysphoric. Oddly never deadnamed though
Oh yeah I have dreams like that too. A lot of the time I dream I have long hair again and I try desperately to cut it but it stays long for some reason and people make fun of me for it and deadname and misgender me. I don't get misgenderd at all anymore in real life so idk what the fuck my brain is doing there lol
yeah i think it’s normal. i’ve really been trying to have lucid dreams so i can change this but months later and i have no results. i’m just like “ugh, really? in my dreams too??” whenever i wake up from a dream i was misgendered/deadnamed in
I have dreams like this at least 2 times a week and mostly in those dreams i am back in my school time but being trans already (in reality i started transition with 21) and everyone bullies me with my deadname and stuff. I have insomnia because of that since years. I guess it will never change.
Thank you for sharing this ! I have the same so I'm really happy that you shared this and that it is normal. thanks really
Sort of; on the rare occassions I dream about myself, I'm still stuck in a female body despite knowing full well it's not who I am. Granted I haven't transitioned yet, but it seems I, too, cannot escape from dysphoria even in dreams.
Thank you so much, I really needed that reassurance. I'm feeling a bit more normal :)
thanks ! I'll try not to think about it too much
oh god that sounds horrible, sorry you've experienced that. I've had a similar dream where teachers I've never met before called me an attention seeking lesbian in front of an entire class of people I don't know. We're in this together mate
Nice avatar :)
Thank you for explaining ! I'm really glad I'm not alone :)
You’re welcome:)
So ""dysphoria dreams"" really are a common experience :/ It's weird I've never heard anyone talk about it before
You're welcome, I'm glad I could help. :)
Great, you should! :)"	vtabeh	trans	154	0.99	2022-07-07 04:54:29
A quick tip for how to quickly and easily stop accidentally misgendering someone	"DON'T MISGENDER THEM EVEN WHEN THEY AREN'T LISTENING!!!

I can't believe the amount of time that I've heard people immediately switch to the wrong pronouns and deadname the minute the trans friend leave the room.

Before I came out people would constantly just ask if [deadname] was around or talk about how annoying it is that she (wrong pronoun) wants us to act like she's a boy when she's around.

Of course you're going to mess up their name and pronouns when you're around them, you refuse to use them any other time!!!"	"Its like adapting to a new name or term, quite easy, for some it might take relearning but its overwhelmingly easy yeah, especially more than calling a dog a ""she"" and the like.
Here is a serious question. I had a patient who I had never seen with makeup or female clothes on and still used her male (birth) name. I noticed she used the woman’s health clinic by the patient chart but had never confirmed if he was trans or not (my facilities computer system is crap and doesn’t identify info such as preferred pronouns) and I was addressing her as sir. One day she shows up with hair and makeup and I asked what the patients preferred pronoun and I couldn’t help but feel like I did something wrong. I didn’t want to make it awkward I just wanted to be respectful of who they are. 

Is it considered rude to ask for the preferred pronoun or is there a more polite way I can ask this question without offending someone?

I know this sounds kinda awkward trying to describe this scenario with my use of the pronouns. 

I knew this patient as a male and came to find out they are a transitioning female. I didn’t want to just immediately call her ma’am cause I was so used to calling her sir with no problems so basically I’m asking… what is a good way to clear these things up without being ignorant.
I mean If I didn't know you were trans, does it still count as being rude?
Something somewhat relevant to this happened to me today, literally the day after I sent an email to my teachers saying I might come out to the class soon (just so it wasn't a complete surprise for them)

My class was in language arts and for some reason these idiots decided to talk about another trans person in my class who had done something earlier. They frequently misgendered him, even after me and a friend of said trans person corrected them, twice. Then they decided to wrap up that conversation and later made a couple transphobic jokes. I knew they frequently acted like idiots but didn't know they were such assholes, but here they were. I believe the teacher of the class kept one of two of them to talk to, but now I don't really want to tell my class.
I learned my mom did that to me and confronted her about during thanksgiving. I reveled in the awkward silence.
Easy two-step solution:
1)Ask
2)Make the necessary efforts, breaking habits is not that hard when you're actually trying to
Definitely ask in this situation! You can say “hey, my computer system doesn’t tell me your preferred name or pronouns. I want to make sure I get them right. Right now I have you as (name), any changes in the name or pronouns I should use for you?”

Look, most of us get that EMR systems are sometimes limited in the info they give. I’d much rather have someone ask and then do their best to get it right from then on (do you have the ability to put a note that you personally will see in this patient’s file every time? If so definitely put a reminder there) rather than assume and then get defensive when corrected.
The easy solution here is to just ask absolutely everyone, regardless of situation or background, what their proper (not preferred) are. Barring that though, I'd say you handled the situation pretty well. Once you began to doubt the validity of the pronouns you were already using you asked the patient to clarify and didn't just assume so kudos.
In addition to the other comments, I feel that is a smidge more respectful to say (and think) ""pronouns"" instead of ""preferred pronouns."" Semantically speaking, there is nothing wrong with ""preferred pronouns."" But, for cisgender people they don't have ""preferred pronouns,"" they just have pronouns.

It's a small thing, but it will mean a lot to a lot of people.
I'm more talking about when people use the right name and pronouns when the person is around, but the minute they leave the people switch back to the wrong name and pronouns.
Thank you and everyone else for the approval of being straightforward and asking. I guess it threw me off when she came to the clinic all dolled up… she asked me if she passed. I thought she was talking about the covid test and she said “no I mean as a woman”. I told her yes and she looked wonderful.
I wish there was a way but our system is trash. At my last job it had a place by their name at the top where you could enter that info easily but with the system we use it would just end up buried in their notes and no one would see unless they go looking. Sometimes the gender is updated but rarely.
Thanks.
For sure. And thanks for the insight.
Oh, well luckily I have never done that, mainly because I haven't met any trans women or men yet
Yeah, I get it. There’s unfortunately a wide variety in quality on EMR systems, and a wide variety in how much importance medical systems place on making that info available to providers. 

I’d say, to the degree possible, ask. And also be transparent with your patients about what you’re able to see in the system. As an example - I’m a patient in a staff model HMO. My preferred name and pronouns are in my chart, so any provider who’s opening my chart will see it. However, it doesn’t print out on labels for things like radiology orders or lab, and it doesn’t show on the initial screen that the pharmacist is looking at. So, those folks are going to call my legal name. I can prepare myself for that. I’ll generally make sure I’m sitting pretty close to the call window so they only have to call me once and don’t have to foghorn it over the waiting room.

By contrast, if it takes me by surprise it really sucks. I had a recent urgent care visit where almost everyone used the wrong name and pronouns, even after being corrected. Triage nurse, main nurse, doctor, literally everyone except the radiology tech. That hurt a lot more because they had access to that info and just didn’t care. 

So, that’s sort of a rambling way of saying… intent matters. Asking your patients lets them know that you care about getting it right.
Thanks for sharing your experience… my main goal at work is to just provide patients with a good positive experience so hearing these stories from everyone in the comments helps me to make better choices for providing that good experience… we didn’t get a class on this cause dip shit Donald banned the federal government from teaching about LGBTQ issues in federal employee orientations. Pretty crazy right?
Ahhh, yeah, I hear you! The degree to which this all gets politicized is crazy."	t5wup0	trans	160	0.99	2022-03-03 17:30:25
Can't change my pronouns	"(TW: Misgendering)

Had to go to the hospital today unfortunately. The whole time I'm getting sir'd even thought they ma'amed me over the phone. I asked if I can change my pronouns from he/him to they/them and they say no, because they have to go by what's on the driver's license.

:'("	"Lmao that's such bullshit. Medical care's primary goal is ""do no harm and help the patient as best you can"", nothing in there about pronouns. I bet they never use anyone's nicknames either, because they have to go by what's on the drivers license? Sounds like someone decided to be transphobic today. Lodge a complaint and/or leave a negative review.
My hospital system allows you to register on MyChart and update your preferences name and gender there.  They aren’t consistent about using it though.
Lol since when are pronouns on your driver's license?  Sounds like bullshit transphobia to me.
Damn, that sucks. You're a them to me
“Go by what’s on the drivers license” isn’t an exact science either. Where I live you can change your gender marker on a driver’s license without any formal documentation. That’s just a transphobic cop-out statement. You can address someone’s medical issues while taking their AGAB into account but using their preferred pronouns. I’m sorry you had to go through that.
That shit pisses me off so much.

I'm trying to train myself to respond with stuff like ""Really? That's a weird rule to have. Show me where that's written in your hospital's standards of patient care.""
Hospital staff are trained to use the name a person prefers regardless of legal name. Tell them ""I want to be called she/her. Please call me she/her."" If you get a ""no"" again ask for the number of their patient complaint department and watch  how fast they backpedal.
They can't change it unless you have it legally changed no, but generally you can tell them your preferred pronouns and name and they'll use it. at least in my experience.
They could do so much good and be so much more welcoming if they decided to and made a little effort.

They have failed at being caring humans. :(
Yes, they can change it. My doctors did, and I haven’t changed my gender marker changed yet. They’re full of shit.
In Portugal, they dont care. They use the ones u identify with.
Pronouns aren’t on driver’s licenses. They’re just grasping at straws looking for excuses to be a transphobe and found a lame one that makes them sound like a dickhead moron. Don’t be afraid to stand up for yourself. Be annoying. Annoying is just a social construct that makes it socially unacceptable to be yourself anyway.
I was misgendered the whole time at the hospital and my proper gender is in the computer. They are just assholes
Thank you 🥺
Yeah like I’m currently getting my sex marker legally changed to x suck on that transphobes
I just get nervous I'm gonna cause trouble.
Yeah I know they can't change my sex but they could at least use my pronouns
That's pretty common but it's a good idea to get in the habit of advocating for yourself in health care. Doctors tend to ignore fem presenting people regardless of AGAB. You will most likely need to learn techniques to cut through their paternalistic BS."	st75kf	trans	155	0.99	2022-02-15 16:41:03

why tf do i keep misgendering myself ??	"im a 20 y.o trans guy, i’ve been publicly out as trans since i was 14, everyone in high school / my parents / coworkers all call me my preferred name / pronouns, i’ve been on T for more than 2 years, but sometimes i’ll be by myself and thinking of myself in third person and i’ll accidentally call myself the wrong pronoun, like wtf ??!???? why does this happen ?!!1?1? 

i’m 100000000% extremely confident that i am a guy, i feel as tho i am a guy, no one in my life calls me my dead-anything, so why the fuck do i still sometimes misgender myself ?? it fucking annoys me so much. i’ve been out for more than 6 years i dont understand why this is happening. 

like i really dont get it. thoughts ?"	"Tbh I do that sometimes. I think it’s nothing to worry about just keep being you
[deleted]
I wouldn't worry about it.  I do this too sometimes.  And its like BRAIN STOP PLEASE!  Its hard to undo 15+ years of hearing yourself as one gender then fully believing that yes... you are the other gender now.
I keep doing this to myself too I think for me at least it's just what I'm use to
From what I've seen, misgendering ourselves is pretty common. Think about it: you spent 14 years calling yourself one pronoun, but only 6 calling yourself the other. Your brain developed while hearing one pronoun, so you are constantly training it to switch, but sometimes our brains aren't the best at retaining info and breaking habits. You're valid, it's just purely brain chemistry being dumb.
I do the same thing. It’s extremely annoying.
Habit? Insecurity in your validity?
I do it sometimes myself, occasionally it's because I cover around my family, but most times I am mad at myself and do it to hurt me
Idk if this particular factoid will help but a lot of gay men call themselves and each other “she” but they’re all still men! Like, “how is *she* though”? You know?
Yeah I do that a lot too. In the habit of say fucks sake man, things like that to myself now that I'm out it feels weird and I have to say no I'm a bitch remember 😝
Is frustrating but normal.
I do the same thing. It takes time. You'll feel like a dumbass for it, but it's okay.
You just used the other set of pronouns for so long before hand, yk like a majority of your life. It's alright to accidentally go back to them sometimes, like an injury still healing. Like i burned my hand bad when i was 6, and i still hold it like it's in bandages sometimes at 16
I think for me its the opposite, Ive only misgendered myself a few times and after that I never did, I think it may be because you have a different mindset but im not sure
That just happens sometimes. You've spent so long calling yourself a certain way that it takes time to re-train yourself with the new name and pronouns. I've misgendered myself a couple times, too. I think we all have, at some point. It's like muscle memory, or habit.
Why did I call two separate elementary school teachers *mommy*?  Knowing something and accessing that knowledge before I say something are two entirely different kettles of fish.
I think we all do it. Its a matter of habit we need to break. I was that person for ~30years, and out for only a few months, so I give myself and everyone else the benefit of the doubt, for a bit
Yo for real. But I also accidentally use the wrong pronouns with cis people and I think it's just cause s/he are so close that it's easy to accidentally say the wrong one. 

I had a mandarin Chinese teacher and she would mix up pronouns on accident all the time and that made me feel better about misgendering myself on accident lol.
I do it sometimes as well. I'm still closeted though so for me it's probably a bit of habit but I think it happens to everyone.

Like yesterday I thought to myself ""but as a guy...oh wait whoops"" kinda sucks but is normal.
Same my guy. I think it just happens sometimes. We are pressured into our gender roles as children and even when we think we have erased the past, it still likes to linger and slap us in the face once an a while. My brain started using ""we"" a while ago, and hinestly, i havent misgendered myself since then.
I feel like an incredible amount of trans people deal with this. Bare minimum I know I do and a lot of people I know do. It’s weird because it hurts in such a personal way when you do it to yourself aaaaaaaand it makes it that much more annoying when people can’t just make the mistake, correct, and move on. Instead they try to explain to us how “hard” it is and “I’ve just been using *deadname/wrong pronouns* for so long it’s just hard” like we don’t understand infinitely better than them already.
yeah its just so annoying still doing it 6+ years out
Same. I just pass it as nothing, as long as you're happy with who you are then it's probably just a minor mistake

Nothing like getting all dolled up only to get misgendered to ruin a day	"I got a nice dress a while back and I decided I'd wear it today, and it looked great. Did my makeup all nice, styled my hair, and I even recently found a bra that kinda fits so when I was all set I felt really good. I had no where to go except do some grocery shopping, but I thought I would look good doing it. Great day, feelin' good, chatted with the cashier, paid for my stuff and just as I am about to leave she says ""have a good day sir"". It shattered my mood.

I corrected her and she seemed sorry, though I don't know if she said it on purpose or not. I mean, I know I don't pass, but I have sparkly red nails, have makeup on, have a pretty little necklace, and I'm wearing a dress, but she still called me ""sir""?!?

I've never been so disappointed in all my life. I usually don't care, it happens. I am not the most feminine looking woman, and I see how I am changing all the time and have patience, but I really tried so hard today and I still got called ""sir""

Anyway, I held back my tears til I got home, then got a big hug from my kid. It makes me want to just hide under a rock and never come out.

Anyway, that was my day. Hope everyone else's day is better.

edit: Now that the crying is done, I'm gonna use this experience for motivation. The best way to look for feminine is to continue to loose weight and exercise (I'm still a pretty big girl). It's a long road and I just have to keep on walking it."	"I'm like 9% sure people think I'm trans masc. Starting with the nutritionist at the gender clinic I went to. (Straight up said it.)

I have booba, child bearing hips, but every single time ""he, sir"". And they always look uncertain when they say it. Like they're afraid they made a mistake, but are pretty certain I used to be a women. 

It gives me a chuckle everytime.
It drives me absolutely nuts to be called sir when I’m in full femme mode. I can understand it (but I’m still disappointed) when it happens and I’m wearing shorts and a T-shirt and little makeup.
Aww, I'm sorry to hear that! You're an amazing woman, and I bet you looked stunning in that dress! ❤️
Some people are just bad at genders. When I had a ponytail ( a SMAAAALLL one) customers at my old job always called me ma'am or young lady from the back even though I had broad shoulders and no butt at that time. Seems like an honest mistake since she apologized. It is still hurtful though and I'm sorry you had to go through that.
Since I don't know exactly how things happened, it would be difficult to offer a moderately valid opinion. But if it's true that she apologized after realizing her mistake, I think you should at least give her the benefit of the doubt. While wearing jewelry and makeup may be indicative of a person's gender, I learned along the way that it's not really determinative. I had the opportunity to meet a guy who dressed extremely feminine, although he had certain masculine features. When we struck up a conversation I referred to him as ""She"" before he told me his name, as I thought the clothes and accessories he was wearing were a clear sign that he perceived himself as female. However, he corrected me and told me that he was a man and that what he was doing was only because he liked to walk around dressed like that from time to time. Cross-dressing was his hobby. 

I think the guy might have been angry with me, thinking that because he was wearing nice clothes and accessories I had a right to assume he was a woman. Wouldn't that be showing my prejudice? And yet, he kindly corrected me and we got to chatting about other things. 

The truth is, I don't know what you must have gone through. But equally I would tell you that there is no need to attribute malice to something that can be explained by simple ignorance and, in truth, I think we are all inevitably ignorant at some point and on some subject.
Honestly, in situations like that I think the very least someone can do is just leave out any kind of honorific! Like just say have a good day! I was out with my trans masc boyfriend while I was presenting femme at lunch and the waitress still made a point to address him as ma'am and me as sir!? It's hard not to look at situations like that as being intentionally malicious
The thing is, bottom line, people can't know anything for certain unless you tell them. Since all genders are valid, and all ranges of gender expression are valid, you have to give everyone the benefit of the doubt unless you have told them and they still do it wrong. I'm sorry they got it wrong.
I'm sorry. I definitely feel your pain.
In school I had long hair, and wasn't presenting femme yet and people said I looked like a girl aaallll the time! But now dressing up, doing makeup, doing my hair I don't? Humans are the worst
Sounds like you pass so well people who are informed that you're trans but no more specifics think you're just starting your journey from the opposite direction.
IKR. I'll go out in jeans and a tank top with just lipstick on and people still say ""maam"". But I get all dressed up and made up and someone calls me ""sir""?!? I guess I shouldn't try so hard.
I thought I did. I thought I looked better in it than 95% of the other outfits I have. Thanks for the kind words.
I hope it was a just a mistake on her part, but I still don't see why anyone wouldn't call someone wearing a dress, makeup, has a purse, and beautiful nails ""maam"" and not ""sir"". 

I got home and made some food with the veggies I bought and relaxed a little and at least I feel better about it now. 

When I was in HS I had really long hair and would have teachers misgender me from behind or if they couldn't see my face. I always hated it, not realizing at the time that I really wanted to embrace it and go with it. It's the reason I grew facial hair as soon as I was able to.
I get it, I was just not expecting it and had put in so much effort and felt so good, it just hit me hard. Seems silly when I think about it now, guess it was just an emotional day.
Ikr. The best way to go about it is just don't use gender, just say ""have a nice day"" without the sir or maam. 

I actually went back to the store today for some lettuce and a different cashier called me maam like 3 times. Hi maam. Plastic or paper maam. Have a good day maam. So if I don't try, I present better than if I get all dolled up apparently. :)
It was just disappointing and unexpected.
I got misgendered all the time in HS when I had long hair. I wish I could have appreciated it at the time. :)

Today I went back to the grocery store for some lettuce, didn't try to look anything, but wore my normal (girl) clothes and some lipstick. the cashier called me maam at least 3 times.

I guess the lesson here is to not try and you won't be disappointed? Seems like something Homer Simpson would say to Bart.

Humans are bad, but maybe not the worst.

edit: I did an internet search for the worst animals and yeah, humans are the worst.
That nutritionist was from when I just started my journey. lol. 

But I don't really talk about being trans or honorifics unless it actually matters. So I doubt it's cuz I pass! But maybe...
I can relate, I pass in jeans (long or short) t-shirt and tanks.  When I put on a dress I draw a lot of long looks.  Maybe I pass on the butch scale but not when full femme is rocking.  It kinda fits my style though so 🤷‍♀️
I've worked grocery before. Shift length, amount of sleep, workload, etc. can a contribute to a mistake like this. I've seen very feminine cis women accidentally get sir'd numerous times, I've seen very masculine men get ma'am. Have a nice evening in the morning, have a nice morning at night and so on. When a job involves as much small talk as that it's only a matter of time until you put your foot in your mouth with an unintentional slip of the tongue.
I understand. I'm sorry! <3
Oh, I don't think I pass at all no matter what I wear, but I still seem to get less ""sirs"" when I am not trying.
I kinda thought maybe that was it, too. You just automatically say things without thinking sometimes. Like when you buy a movie ticket and they say ""enjoy the show"" and you say ""you too"" because you are used to people telling to to have a good day after a transaction.

It still made me sad, but that's okay. It was the first time being misgendered actually upset me, usually it just slides off.
Thanks
I should say that I use pass pretty loosely, if I’m gendered correctly and don’t get wired looks that’s close enough for me.  At age 42 and 18 months on HRT this girl will always be trans.  Sending hugs 🤗
It's 100% okay for it to upset you, I just want to reassure you that it probably had absolutely nothing to do with your appearance since an experience like this gets me overthinking everything about how I look
I'm (46 but if you ask me I am 36) in my 8th month so I hope a year from now with my weight loss and the effects of E, I will pass much better. Thanks for the hugs!"	vqu1sc	trans	143	0.97	2022-07-03 23:36:02
i’ve come out to my parents 2 years ago. today my mum has once again decided to deadname me from now on.	"I, (ftm 16) came out to my parents around 2019-2020. both are not very supportive, but they decided not kicking me out and letting me dress as i want is ‘extremely supportive’. since 2020 i’ve been going to therapy frequently. my therapist scheduled a group session with my parents, where we came to the conclusion to call me by my nickname, so i don’t feel so shitty every day. my parents agreed, and they’ve been doing that ever since. my father has never slipped up once, he even referred to me with he/him pronouns on occasion, and its never been a problem for him. my mother on the other hand often slips up, always misgenders me and gets very mad if i correct her.

today she told me that i should stop correcting her, that she’s going to deadname me from now on because ‘its too annoying for her’. my mother has never been as supportive as my father, there have often been arguments between us where she would yell at me, tell me i could never change/be a man, threatened to break the door open if i hid in my room, etc etc. for a while we haven’t had a fight that would get out of hands like that, but i’m afraid she will become like that again if i tried standing up for myself.

i don’t know what to do. i just want her to accept me, like my father does (which isn’t even that much, he does not want to call me by my preferred name nor see me as his son)

i would appreciate any advice/help"	"I don't believe she is ever going to support you with the way she's reacting, I'm sorry. Definitely something to tell your therapist about at least. I also assume you will get kicked out once you hit 18 so I would make plans to leave. Parents like her suck.
>today she told me that i should stop correcting her, that she’s going to deadname me from now on because ‘its too annoying for her’.

""It's my name. How you feel about it is irrelevant. The nickname was a compromise. The alternative is (chosen name). (Deadname) is not an option. This is my boundary. I deserve to be referred to in the way I choose. Please respect it.""

If she keeps arguing, just keep repeating yourself. Be calm, and don't take bait. Don't let her guilt you, don't let her threaten you, don't let her rile you up. You are allowed to have boundaries, even with parents. You're 16, not 6.

Just keep emphasizing that this is about you. Don't let her make it about her. It's about you, and how you want to be referred to. You are allowed to tell the people you love not to call you things that you don't like. That's a very, very basic boundary.

If she yells at you, don't yell back. Be calm. If she starts hitting things or breaking things, please call an adult you trust and get away as soon as you can. Violence is not love.
Parents being “supportive” means driving and participating in pride events, helping out lgbt individuals and being a safe space for them, etc.

Your parents aren’t supportive. Parents really have one major goal, and that’s to love their children unconditionally. Your parents have failed this. Letting you dress how you want and not kicking you out isn’t on any scale of supportive, it’s literally the bare minimum. Imagine if you weren’t trans and they were acting this same way.

Obviously you know that your parents aren’t supportive of course, but that doesn’t mean anything against you. That’s their own fault that they’re choosing not to love their child unconditionally. It’s why the premise of found family is so important.
Try to become financially and emotionally independent. If you don’t rely on them for money or emotional support, they suddenly have way less control over your life and how you view yourself. Even though I became financially independent from 22 on I still had a lot of emotional baggage and guilt over transitioning that it took me 4 years to finally transition. Don’t be like me! Good luck
Have you talked with your father about her? From the sound of things, he seems to be more accepting. Could he help?💛
Ignore her. Don't speak to her if you do use male pronouns.
yeah, i’ve come to that realisation. i told her i would move out as soon as possible but then she gets all sad, asking me if she really was such a bad mum, etc? she really gives me mixed signals, but i cant wait to get out of this household for sure
thank you so much! i’ll try this
thank you!
its comforting to hear that this really is the case, and not just my imagination
no sadly, ive tried that before. either he pats my back saying ‘its gonna be fine’ or he just tells me thats the way my mum is
my mother is quite aggressive towards him too and he never defends himself or me because he knows my mother will get even more mad
She's gaslighting you. If she actually cares this wouldn't happen. Be ready to leave as soon as you are 18. This is all textbook psychological abuse and im sorry you grab r to deal with it :/
I think that's the best decision and I wish you all the best ❤
You should be honest and she should be sad. She is a bad mom and she should know it, but that is not anyways practical. 

You should focus on minimizing your relationship with her and only interact as nessesary. If she wont let you stay in your room, be visibly miserable somewhere else. The goal is absolutely to make her feel bad. The goal is not to fight with her. Fighting will only make things worst. 

It can and will be hard, but as a minor, you will need to learn to ignore her attempts to trigger you. You will never win the argument. You will only incur more wrath. The only chance she will ever change is if she cares about you enough to want you around. You will not be able to talk her into accepting you. 

You may need to cut her off when you are old enough to leave.
> asking me if she really was such a bad mum

Tell her yes. Refusing to love and support her child makes her a terrible parent.
Please be safe. I had to completely cut off my parents as they refused to stop calling me names I asked them not to repeatedly--- among other reasons. 

My mom kept insisting this bizarre assertion that if you love someone, you let them do things you don't like because you love them. Like, her brother called her a name she hated, and she let him, because she loved him. She couldn't understand the crucial difference consent. She consented to that with her brother. I don't consent to it with her. 

Setting boundaries is healthy. If I was doing something a loved one hated, I'd want them to tell me, because I don't want to keep doing something that they don't like. 

I hope you can work things out with your parents. Your father sounds like he might come around some day. Your mother.... sounds like my mother. I hope I'm wrong.
oh :( i am aware that she is always gaslighting me about something, but i didnt know it included that too. thank you <3

Is it safe for me to move into a home with a next door neighbor who flies large right winged political flags?	"So I’m in a bind and I have to move. The only home available has a neighbor RIGHT next to me with the biggest police lives flag I’ve seen… now I’m very much a liberal. And I’ve been assaulted and harassed (physically and mentally) by people with these political views. In my last apartment complex I had a women out me to literally everyone she met. People targeting me. And obviously the misgendering on purpose.
I have ended up feeling terrified for my life and I had to move. I would have to carry around a switchblade just to leave my apartment bc of the fear.
So I need some advice here. I think that this place would be potentially dangerous or volatile. I also have terrible ptsd and will probably go off on them if I ever hear the wrong thing said because I just tend to get involved in altercations (not fights but like arguing) due to my mouth.
Honestly I already screamed and said I plan to cut every single piece of that flag that flies into my yard so I can burn it in a bonfire in front of them….
I am also a medical marijuana user. I don’t need police coming around. 
What’s going to happen when I put my pride flag out in June? 
It’s not just violence that I’m worried about but uncomfortable tensions. It’s a very very small home sandwiched between classic New York rednecks making fires in their backyards and all."	"Sounds like a bad idea to me. If you know from your side that you will have trouble staying calm, then stay away.
I’m a spiteful sob, I would set up a couple of subtle security cameras and go fucking nuts with pride shit. Like over the top flags everywhere, gay gnomes fucking. Then just sit back and wait for the fun to begin. No confrontation just keep track of the damage until it becomes felony destruction of property, grab a good lawyer and go to town.
Seriously any advice! Maybe I’m just paranoid. I just really don’t want to end up dead or have someone harassing me.
To add. Yes I’m covered in tattoos, even my hands. But not my face. And I am pierced on my septum. I also have longer hair for a straight man. People assume I’m a gay man pretty much daily. Im flamboyant and I don’t want to change for other people.
The neighbors in question have like 7 pickup trucks in the driveway and were nosey while we looked at the place. This little house is a 1 bedroom standalone home. It’s very very close to the neighbors 
Only reason I even am asking is I have to move in a few days and I can’t seem to find anything else that takes pets. But I would rather stay with family for a bit and find a safer place
[removed]
You should consider making the change between liberal to socialist 😉
Better safe then sorry. Ofcourse there is always a chance they may be decent neighbors, but I wouldn’t risk the likely possibility of them being horrific neighbors if I didn’t absolutely have to, especially when you are visibly a minority. 

If you do move there I’d try to be the best neighbor I could be. Don’t instigate any problems. Just live your life and hope they keep to live theirs, but that sounds exhausting
TBH I think the marijuana is the biggest reason not to move next to the cop-lovers.
I am also looking for a new place. There was a home I really likes but two neighbors on the block had some very conservative flags, one police flag and one flag that read ""tr*mp won"". We loved the home itself but we moved on without a second thought. I doubt they would go out of their way to physically harm me or my partner, but I am a very non passing trans women and I would not be comfortable there at all. It sounds like the thoughts of living there are making you uncomfortable, and that's totally fair. I personally would not put myself in that situation. My home is my sanctuary and I should feel 100% safe and secure when I am home. Half of this country sucks. Avoid it if you can.
Get a gun for your safety and you should be good
Idk a lot of the things you described definitely do not scream transphobe to me but maybe im just naive?

Edit: for all you know they could be a gay cop that will love your pride flag
Yeah..I'm sorry, I'm facing the same crap my wife is pulling me to FL from OH and I was like 😳 
she's in the medical field soooooo...she is the main bread winner and my biggest supporter.. Lol soooo if any of us here are in FL tell me I'll be OK lol 😂
Saying that you planned to cut their flag and burn it won’t help you get on their good side. I’d say try to be nice, and most rednecks will be nice to you. Also, trying to avoid politics if you have to talk to them is a good thing, because it can lead to conflict. Just nod your head in acknowledgment and move on in the conversation. Agree to disagree perhaps?
How are the other neighbors?  Can you talk to them and see what their politics are?
I wouldn't do it myself. We all deserve to be anywhere we want to, but who wants to be constantly on edge in your own home.
Would you move next to an ex-con that was convicted of a violent crime?  Probably not.  Suggest you look the next town over or buy yourself a used RV.
Thats not safe i suggest trying to find anywhere different
In my experience, if you get a weird vibe leave lol
I don't know what this area is or what it's like and i've been living in a city for the last 6 years but before then every suburban style neighborhood of homes I lived in you basically just ignored the neighbors forever. Houses are different than apartment complexes in that it's much more likely for you to just never interact with them.

of course that does not change your personal feelings of safety and security and those come first.
If you do move there i would make sure to get a home security  system installed and getting a gun wouldnt be a bad idea.
Why would you want to live next door to that?
Yeah I also caught the vibe very quickly. I’m not welcome there. I mean I can rent the home but the neighbors came out all to stare at me and make me uncomfortable.
I just don’t want to get like harassed. I already would have to tell them to move the flag so it doesn’t flap around my yard bc my dog will have a field day with it lol. My parents just don’t understand that people who typically affiliate themselves with the police lives movement stand against people like me, and my wife who is Hispanic.
Lol best advice so far! No but seriously if I have to move there I will be getting cameras and I am spiteful like that. My last place I put up a trans flag and I actually had someone in this private apartment building put a “Jesus can save you” pamphlet on my door step… 😂
this is exactly what i would do lmao
Look after yourself first and foremost! If you can stay with ppl who care about you for a little longer, that might be safest. But don’t change who you are. We all know how much worse that is. Stay safe and stay strong :)
One flag means ""gay people should have rights"" and the other flag means ""I think police shouldn't be held accountable for brutality.""  Implying they're equally valid is asinine.
Yeah but gay pride is not a political movement. Very different. They are hanging a flag that is actually offensive to many.
lol that was my first thought when I drove up to the house…
Yes exactly! It’s like I will be scared every moment I’m there. I live with ptsd. I’m trying to heal. I’ve been disabled due to it for 6 almost 7 years now. I’ve been harassed and assaulted for being trans before so I’m terrified for it to happen again. I want to live in a place that makes me feel safe. Not scared.
It’s just hard when you have animals it’s like the listings go from 800 to 6… 😣
It’s concerning that this is also some of the best advice I’ve gotten. Got knows how many they have  next door… It will be a stand off then 😂
Wait I did not say that to them!!! I wouldn’t say that to them that would be messed up! I was saying that like as a joke in anger. But yes you can usually just nod and deal with the redneck bullshit by me. But in NY the rednecks really just don’t know how to take a hint to eff off. It can just get really annoying.
Think of king of the hills. It’s just beers and fires all day. Great example of my suburban/rural area 😂
Unfortunately where I live here in NY, everyone is nosey and it’s very confrontational. I hate it. You will have your neighbors screaming at you or calling the police on you for every little thing you do. I guess this is just normal to me
I was being kinda forced into a situation due to lack of housing and time (April 1st.) but at the last hour I have secured a very nice place that will not have this problem! Seriously feeling so fortunate right now!
Trust me. I would never want to live there it would be hell 😅
Don’t do it. You don’t need that kind of negativity in your life.
Ha, just keep in mind, the key to the success of my plan is to just fucking ignore them. Don’t escalate, don’t talk to them, just quietly replace anything that’s damaged. A. So they don’t escalate into violence, B. Show them that you don’t have fear C. Sometimes these folks need to meet someone like us for them to understand what trans means, so don’t be hostile. I’ve made some powerful Allie’s this way.
If you can practice your ned Flanders impersonation if you do have to talk to them, it’s satisfyingly infuriating.
If I’m correct in my information, the Police Life’s Matter movement is just to not have hate against  law enforcement in general. Their actions however, should absolutely be held accountable for.
Many people are offended by the pride flag for the LGBT community, why would you hang your flag if people got offended by it? It is, quite frankly, not their job to handle other people’s emotions. That same logic applies to everyone, including anyone part of the LGBT community. This is America, we can say or believe whatever we want. Maybe we don’t agree with one another but we have the right to speak our minds.
Phew. So glad to hear you're going to be safe.
That's the what they say it means but then people were wielding Blue Lives Matter flags while they were attacking cops at the January 6th insurection.  It's pretty clear that the stated meaning of those flags and the actual meaning as it's understood by people who fly them are two different things.
Imagine not understanding the concept of a dogwhistle lmao
I wasn’t telling them to take down their flag. I was asking for advice if it would be safe for me to live next to people filled with so much hatred. 
And people that are offended by rainbows and pride are homophobic and transphobic pr*cks because  pride doesn’t affect people like police brutality does. 
Someone who gets offended by LGBTQ+ things usually have some unresolved issues themselves. The biggest homophobes usually have a thing for butt stuff anyways 😂
True, some of the people supporting act differently. But I can make a number of movements who have those kinds of people. The people in movements are separated into different categories, some good and some bad.

Edit: for those of you down voting, there were violent riots and mobbing for the BLM movement as well, I hope you’re not going to ignore those when processing my previous statement.
Explain to me, if it’s so ridiculous.
You don’t know for sure that they’re hateful people, you shouldn’t be so quick to label them as such. And while supporting police brutality isn’t a good thing in the slightest, none of us on here actually know why they’re hanging that flag. They could be a cop for all we know, or have a relative that’s one. I can name at least one thing in which our community has impacted other activities. It’s very controversial so I won’t name it. If you want advice, I’ll provide you with some: If you think it’s unsafe, go over and talk with them. Find out what kind of people they are instead of judging them based on their views. Hell, I agree with most conservative views and I’m gay.

Blue lives matter got started as a knee jerk reaction to Black Lives Matter.  Let me as you a question.  Logging is the number one most hazardous job.  Why don't we have Logging Lives Matter flag?
Yeah, okay.

In *The Discourse,* a dogwhistle refers to a way of signalling some kind of meaning to those who understand it without letting anyone else who hears/reads it know what you're talking about. Basically, a kind of in-group specific euphemism.

So why does verasev think ""police lives matter"" means ""I think police shouldn't be held accountable for brutality""? Well basically, you gotta look at the usage of the expression in the context in which it's used. And that context is usually in response to people saying that ""Black Lives Matter,"" a slogan protesting the excessive and often racially biased use of force by the police. If you're familiar with talking to people on the internet, you might realise that this is what's called a ""whataboutism;"" a way of dismissing someone's concern by bringing up another, though usually hypothetical, scenario. Since we're here on r/trans, you might be able to think of another common use of this tactic by bigots.

So when you say ""black lives matter,"" and someone else says ""police lives matter,"" what they're implying is ""yeah look mate, I don't really care that you think black lives matter, so in order to derail this conversation from things we can do to change the racist way this system operates, I'm gonna bring up this other thing that I may or may not actually care about to distract you.""
Because people aren’t going after loggers. Many people have started saying “defund the police” because of one action from one police officer. This is starting to affecting many police officers who could be actual good people. It COULD be that it started as a knee jerk. Or, people are concerned that this might start getting out of hand. Either are probable.
Thanks.
It's not one action from one police officer.  At all.  That's such a ridiculous claim I'm not going to even argue with you about it because if you did even half a second of looking you could find swarms of incidents a lot like it.  You aren't arguing in good faith and you don't belong here.  Just leave.
> one action from one police officer

This convinced me to look at your post history. 

That's a yikes from me dog.
I’m talking about the George Floyd case, that’s what sparked all of this sudden burst about BLM and PLM, and defunding the police. That’s not to say that there aren’t corrupt police officers, don’t misunderstand me there.
We have our opinions, and so what if mine differs? I know what post you’re referring to so if you have an issue with that you take can it up with me in dms.
>Derek Chauvin, one of four police officers who arrived on the scene, knelt on Floyd's neck and back for 9 minutes and 29 seconds.

Like damn it's not even one police officer in the exact example you're trying to use.

Idk I checked your profile too after the other comment mentioned it. Mega yikes.

Edit: oh it's not one action either lol

>
For the 2017 case incident, in which Chauvin had grabbed a 14-year old by the throat, hit the 14-year old in the head with a flashlight, and kneeled on the 14-year old's neck and upper back despite the 14-year old being prone, handcuffed and not resisting, Chauvin admitted violating the 14-year old's constitutional right to be free from unreasonable force by a police officer.

And also tax evasion charges and and getting special treatment in jail like letting him use a guard's cellphone.
I promise you, if you think it's only one post and not a string of issues, I didn't get that far.

I'm kinda glad I didn't, if it was worse than the rest.
Alright, so it’s not one case. I didn’t have the full facts. Fair enough.

PARENTS NOT ACCEPT ME	"So hi im (ftm) im 17 and i go by name Max .

I live in that kind of family where my parents are “loving” , let me dress alternative ,buy me all the stuff that i want ,making me food etc but

When it come to trans theme ( that im talking about from when i was 13 because i have huge dysphoria..im rn at that point that i dont even talk anymore because of my voice and the dysphoria making me cry every week from when i was 13 to 17) btw i come out multiple times and explained it all but they said they dont care how i identify ,and that for the im always gonna be a girl

And year ago till now i started beging my  parents everyday to dont call me “princes , girly girl ,girl etc… they always yell at me  ..pronouns and my name would never be accept they cant even stop calling me a girl :/  they say that “how can you even ask for something like that?!” In yelling..They beated me ..they telling me what genitalia i have..mom once started calling me girl like 20 times after i said her to stop…they telling me that in that house i will never be anything else than a girl even i take T and if i will take T to leave the house and never come again . They said that i dont deserve food because of that…or they said i would rather die at born. And if im not their “girl” they arent my “mom”. Dad”… they even pulled me out from the house for asking to stop calling me girl… not even pronousn its imposible to ask for that im misgendered daily…

Please what to do…the only thing keeping me alive is the wish that i will once take t..(i hope at 18 secretly till i move out)"	"I wish I had some magical advice. I can say you are not alone and offer you a digital hug. I know its just platitudes,  but its true and meant in love.
First and foremost, you are a valid guy, and I acknowledge your male gender. I know that a stranger on the internet can't erase your parents' harm with a few words, but you deserve validation from someone. Second, they aren't acting like loving and supportive parents, and that is another validation you deserve to hear. They are *abusing* you. Third, you are not alone. If I could hug someone through the internet, I would give you a hug. I'm sorry this is your life right now. I'm sorry they have all the control right now. It's only for now. It's not forever.

I would like to offer you some strategy. I want to help you get through the next year. I want you to be able to leave them on your eighteenth birthday and have somewhere safe to live. However, I need to ask some questions before I can.

.
1 . Are you still in school?

.
2 . ~~Will your parents allow you to have a job?~~ **edit:** I just saw your comment that says you can't work. I understand. Do you have access to government assistance like disability?

.
3 . Do you have friends who know you are trans? Do they support you?

For now, have an up-vote for support and encouragement. Please, don't hurt yourself. You deserve to live life freely and authentically. I believe you can make it until then. I believe in you.
Please help me .. i cant even have a job because of my mental illnes i have ocd bpd panic attacs social axiety :( what to do
This is literally child abuse. I'm so sorry. You are a valid guy no matter what anyone says or does to you. They can not take your own self away from you. How could they?  


I don't know where you are, what country or if you live in an accepting community. If you do, and you are trans and need to transition to stay mentally healthy and keep yourself alive, I suggest you leave the moment you become an adult if you can make your own way financially. It will be better for you. If you cut contact and say ""you accept me as I am, or you never really loved me in the first place"" they will either prove to you that they love you, or that they never did.  


Please be safe. If they are physically abusing you and its not safe to stay, it may be worth it to look into youth shelters if such a thing is available where you live.
I just stopped calling them Mom and Dad and call them by their birth given name after all their parents thought really long and hard about giving them those names So calling by a title would be beneath you.
 
 Being a little bit of an ass here, but this is how I would solve this issue it shows that disrespect goes two ways, if they point out that you're disrespectful, just say you can't be bothered to respect me why should I be bothered to respect you?

You didn't choose to be born trans, you didn't choose to be born, period.

So they can't really expect you to act grateful because they gave birth to you, I'm saying this because a lot of parents try and use this logic it doesn't work out.

I would just do my best to ignore them, and when you become a legal adult You can just do whatever you want at that point. If you're confronted call them by their legal birth names, it really stings more if you use your mother's maiden name when referring to her by her full name. 

After all her parents gave her that last name so she should respect that..

 You're 17 you got one more year before you're a legal adult, you push through this and make it out .
 
 Keep on keeping on.
ah i get this one hard. My parents always said ""stop it with the trans bullshit and tell us why your so depressed all the time."" Gender dysphoria was the cause of said depression, but i was always forced to go with whatever my mom said the cause was, which she thought was my grades. To this day (3 years after my name change and coming out) she still says ""it's hard to call you by your name because im used to ur deadname"" even though i just stopped responding to my deadname at all. So constantly she will call out my deadname for 10-30 minutes trying to get my attention with the response ""who are you talking to?""
This really sounds like physical and emotional abuse. I am so sorry and no child deserves abuse! If there a safe place for you? An advocacy or LGBTQ shelter or organization near you? You deserve safety first and foremost. I’m really sorry. Child abuse is illegal. I hope you can just be you and be surrounded by love and support that affirms you.
Hey as you are still a minor you can file complaints with the police for abuse, because this is abuse. You don't deserve to live this way no one does. 

Know you are valid.
Call your mom , “Dad”. and call your dad, “mom.”switch how to refer to them. It drives them crazy because they never thought about it before that they could be referred to  how they don’t want. They are so ungrateful and used to it that they don’t understand it’s too a privilege
You need to prepare to get out as soon as you turn 18. Save as much as you can. Idk if you have a job but you should get one. You will likely have to speak a lot and it will be painful but trust me, it will be worth it. If your parents have access to your bank account, look into getting another one where they have no jurisdiction and put your savings in there. If you live in a rural area, getting out may be hard, so you should make a plan - perhaps you could call in a favour with a friend who has a car?

You should also look into the Trevor Project, they can support you. I wish you luck and hope things go well.

I got denied by my parents too and when i came out to my mom she got really upset and started to tell me that i‘ll never be a woman because of my genitalia and that i my body doesn’t work as a woman’s body 

It hurtet me like shit i immediately dressed up and left in tears i have not talked to my parents since then and this helped me a lot 

I really needed some distance from that transphobic environment… 

Keep strong until you can escape that too 

Sending you much love and support my brother ❤️
Thank you <3
Thank you <3! You cant even imagine how much that means to me..

:( sadly im still in school i have 1 more year

2) basically i can work, but i feel so stressed there and im feeling like im gonna throw up every hour from anxiety …and because of that im scared to find new job.. but i would like to work at comic point or cristal shop <3 or something where is not that much mean peoples, becauee im really scared of them

3) no just on internet 1 ! But we wanna meet this april and we know 3 years (she make part of lgbt too) and she calling me by my prefered name and use my right pronouns <3

irl i cant come out to anyone else …my classmates are wery transohobic and toxic and im not lucky to find friends…
It's abuse but honestly the police don't give a shit, and cops or CPS showing up both 1. Won't actually change anything for the better, and 2. Could make OP's living situation *a hell of a lot worse*
What the fuck?
What is problematic in the way i speak :’)) I dont looking for any attention .. im looking for help . Do you know what im just going throught? And you think that my dysphoria is fake or what. If i could chose i would be Cis lmao do you think i like hating my whole body and being hated by my whole family ?
edit.....I want to e clear if doing this is going to put you at risk of violence DON'T....If this abuse is a regular thing outside of the trans conversation, do not confront them in anyway.

Seek outside support, and do not share your plans to get out...handling and abusive framework is very different. and my reply was based on it sounding like you felt there was a way to bridge that gap.
Okay, those answers help me get you some strategies, and I have some follow-up questions. I apologize if I ramble. The NyQuil is kicking in, and I'm about to go to sleep for a few hours. (I have the flu right now.)

.
1 . It's time to stop arguing with your parents. They don't understand and don't *want* to understand. This means that *nothing* you say will change their minds. They believe that being your parents means they're automatically right about everything. That's called, ""parental entitlement,"" and it's nothing more than a bad excuse for parents to ignore something their children are trying to tell them. Living a lie is awful and harmful, but without anywhere else to go, it's your safest option for now. Remember: your parents are *not* your friends or allies — they are your *abusers*. You're going to have to see them through that lens from now on, and it is a hard truth to accept. It is valid to feel badly about that. My parents also abused me harshly, and they also didn't support me. It is painful when the first people who are supposed to love, accept, and care for us refuse to do those things. Unfortunately, they have made themselves your enemies by abusing you. This means that *you live with enemies.* That truth makes it okay to lie to them about this for your safety. If they are going to attack you for being trans, it's better to not provoke them and to avoid risking both your physical safety and the roof over your head. I hate telling anyone to lie to their parents, but again, this is about keeping you safe and housed. Don't fake your emotions, but don't waste your emotional energy on them either — every day you live quietly and patiently through this is one day closer to freedom and authentic living. Just agree with them out loud until the conversation finishes, and then, go to your room to process your emotions. You've made it this far. You're strong. You shouldn't have to be strong, but you are. You can make it just a little further. I'll say it again: ***this is not forever, and I believe in you.***

.
2 . Stay away from them as much as you can. I'm assuming you already do that, though. Also, don't ask them for anything you don't absolutely require. Most developed nations' laws (I don't know where you are; I'm in the US) obligate parents to pay for their minor children's needs, and some even have grey areas for when someone reaches the age of majority but hasn't graduated high school yet and still lives with parents. That is where their obligation to you ends. Remember how I said that they're your enemies because they abuse you? Don't expect an enemy to do anything for you that they aren't obligated to do for you. If they offer you a gift, accept it, but don't ask for anything extra. Assume that anything they give you is something they will use for leverage in an argument.

.
3 . Make graduating your priority for now. Since your parents don't support you, that is going to have to be your primary focus. It seems like you might turn eighteen before you graduate. Unfortunately, graduation still has to be a higher priority than moving out. Trying to find a place to live and do school simultaneously is *a lot*. I have OCD and social anxiety, too. We share those. I also have a couple other diagnoses. I understand how situations and people can drain our energy levels when we become overwhelmed. It's best to focus on one thing at a time to manage your emotional energy. Graduating and living with your parents are already two large demands, so let's focus on getting through that first.

.
4 . Save every penny you make from your job for moving out after you graduate. Your diploma and your job are currently your best two opportunities away from your abusers. ***Spend nothing.*** Your parents have made it clear that they don't intend to support you if you live authentically. Their threat to kick you out means you need to build yourself a safety net. Do you have your own bank account? Does your employer pay you through checks, cash, direct deposit, or a payment card?

.
5 . It sounds like you have formal diagnoses for the OCD, BPD, social anxiety, and panic attacks. Do you have a therapist that won't tell your parents the things you say during your sessions? Such a therapist would be a really good ally to have right now and can help you create better strategies and safety nets than I can. You need one if you don't have one.

.
6 . Build yourself an emotional support structure. After you have a therapist, ask them to put you in touch with a trans support group in your area. Watch this subreddit. If you feel comfortable with it, you're always welcome in my inbox. I'll be your internet mom. Make yourself some internet friends since irl friends are a challenge. I've had to build myself my own chosen family to replace the one I left behind. It's hard, but it can be done. I've never met some of my chosen family in person because we met on the internet and live across the country from each other, but I know that if I reached out to them and said, ""I'm homeless and need somewhere to go,"" they would help me without question. I would do the same for them. Most of us are LGBTQPIA+, and several of us are trans and enbies. Max, you are welcome among my people.

.
7 . Say *nothing* to your parents about the strategies you are using or your intent to leave them and live authentically. They *will* sabotage your efforts, and they'll do it because of parental entitlement.

.
8 . When you finally get to leave, do it and say *nothing*. Don't try to give them one last chance to be family. Don't give them one last argument on your way out the door. Don't say that thing you've always wanted to say but could never get away with before. Just go without a word, and don't look back. Block their phone numbers, email addresses, and social media accounts. Your abusers have had the last seventeen years to figure out how to be family. Maybe in a few years when your living situation is stable, when you've gotten comfortable with the progress you've made in transitioning, and *when you've had some trauma counseling* (because you need that), you can try to rebuild some kind of relationship with them, but I don't recommend it.
You speak like a illiterate child. My daughter is trans and 15. She unlike you uses correct English and proper wording
Don't listen to them or your parents, they don't deserve your attention. There is nothin problematic about you.
Great advice. Much better advice than mine. I just would straight up fist fight my parents in the end for their lack of acceptance.

Especially my dad. That was a daily occurrence from 9-12 with him. Then 12-18 with mom and step dad it wasn’t as violent and often but still pretty often. 

But yeah mine isn’t great cause multiple involuntary psychiatric hospital stays 😂
Im from czechia how the fuckk i should know how to write corectly? You seem like horrible person , and get tf out of there. 

Also i dont understand why would your daughter unlike another trans person because they are abused in their household for 4years thats why? 

You literally deleted your com piece od shit that you are
I dont need your negativity in there.
How good is your Czech? Maybe if you give your complaint in proper Czech it will seem more reasonable.
You deleted it. She didn’t say unlike anyone she just doesn’t believe you either. We just dislike liars. You’re right you should know how to write but you write like a 12 yr old and act like one also"	127gojh	trans	136	0.95	2023-03-31 10:19:05
My dad misgenders me if I accidentally say something ha doesn't like	"TW: SELF HARM, MISGENDERING
          
Some time ago my dad came up to me and told me that he doesn't want me saying ""hello"" anymore because it reminds him of how my stepdad speaks (he has a huge grudge against my stepdad for apparently ""stealing mom away from him"" which is just very untrue) , and to greet him with other ways like hi or hey. Since I'm actually a respectful human, I agreed but clarified that it'll take some time to switch up and to remind me if I accidentally say the wrong thing. Well, guess what his way of ""reminding me"" was? Misgendering.
                 
I've been out to him for about half a year now, and I was hopeful since he FINALLY decided to use my proper pronouns. But apparently he thinks misgendering = a word someone doesn't like, and whenever I accidentally say hello he responds with ""why hello my beautiful daughter"". Every time he's done this I've had a panic attack, even going as far as complitely losing control over myself and starting self harm again after over a year of being clean.
                
I've now developed a fear of accidentally saying the wrong thing, and always panic a little inside if I have to greet him. Even if I do say the right words, I always doubt myself and try to prepare for getting misgendered. So, another thing my dad fucked up added to my list, alongside suspected anxiety. Great, thanks dad. And you always wonder why I never open up to you."	"Have you talked to your mom and step-dad about this? 

Just because he is your biological father doesn't mean you are required to put up with his emotional/mental abuse. Intentionally misgendering you as a punishment/ negative reinforcement is beyond fucked up.

You shouldn't have to change your behavior simply because he's an immature little man baby.

 If he doesn't want to be an adult and actually be your dad then you don't need him or his bullshit in your life.

Don't feel guilty about wanting to protect your mental health. Its ok to cut people out of your life if they are going to intentionally and repeatedly cause you mental anguish.
Never talk to him again. He doesn’t deserve it.
Your dad is an abuser, get away fast
Wow. What a truly awful parent.
Make direct eye contact and call him your stepdad’s name.

I’m sorry this is happening to you <3 sending you lots of hugs!!
It sounds like your dad suffers from being a total idiot, besides being abusive. 

If you feel safe enough to say somthing to him somewhat vulnerable, maybe tell him something along the lines ""I'm just your kid and I just want to know you don't hate me so can you take your bullshit and personal vendettas to a therapist or something instead of laying them on me? I just want us to be okay, I need that from you, I need you to be my dad and not an asshole.""

Or find a way to express that somehow?
[deleted]
That's ugly. Have you tried talking to your mom and stepdad about this?
Is there anyway you could stay with your mom and stepdad full time your dad sounds like an incompetent douche
Maybe your Mom left him for a guy, who would respect his own kid. Telling you to change your language, because of his hurt ego is not ok. Such people know how they make others feel and he knows exactly how you feel when he misgenders you. He seems to be an abusive and manipulative ass, and your mom left him for a good reason. Maybe it is your time to follow her.
[removed]
Ugh.  When I had problems with my parents I simply stopped talking to them for a month.  They got the concept and came around.

I don't know if you are in a position where you can totally avoid him, but I would simply let him to all the talking, don't respond if you have to be in a room with him, and let the silence speak for you, and never talk to him outside of necessary discussions.
Call your stepdad your dad, if he complains tell him things change … or just don’t talk to him anymore. He clearly doesn’t respect you and tries to bully you into submission. He doesn’t deserve you.
Sounds like abuse!
Source: I have been, 3+ medical professionals agree in my case... diagnosed 

I just moved away from that type of atmosphere, and my health has improved big time!

If you can move out,  I recommend! 
you could call him Ms. Step-fathers last name if it is safe to?

🤬 People like that 🤬

Please don't self harm, (I used to, draw instead) 
I wish you the very best!
Thank you all for the amazing comments! It means a lot. Anyway, yes my mom and stepdad know about this. Luckily they are fully supportive about me being non-binary and always help me calm down for panic attacks.
             
Also, I plan on moving out as soon as I can! I'm moving out to a different city to go to collage as soon as I finish high school. Both of my parents know about this, and they are fine with it.
       
And about my dad, he genuinely does care about me, he's not doing this out of being an asshole. He just doesn't understand that dumping your problems out on your child is not ok. He has a new girlfriend now, I hope she can talk some sense into him
What an asshole, I’m sorry about that.

But on the flip side, I’m assuming he doesn’t really understand how misgendering can be pretty dehumanizing or embarrassing. Sometimes if you just politely have a convo with them and explain that they’ll usually stop in my experience.
He doesn’t deserve you to hurt yourself he’s a little bitch for trying to do that
Wow, this is toxic and I consider it to be abuse.

Can you get out of the situation? For example ask your mum and step dad for help and live with them?

Having survived abusive parents my best advice would be to get our of the situation as soon as you can. I discontinued all contact with my family and it was the best decision I could have made.

Prior to escaping I think the best solution to the misgendering and him not wanting you to say hello to him is obvious, stop greeting him at all and where possible don't speak to him. When you see him just nod, don't smile or be friendly. BTW, nodding to people tends to be a common gesture for men so it's good for that too.
That would be perfect for r/pettyrevenge
The problem is that they have the same name- :'D
Sorry but thats like telling a bank rober, ""do you know that what you are doing is wrong?""

I understand where you are coming from. But I honestly find heartbreaking how many upvotes this got. Feels like my life all over again, let's just say you are lucky if you think this can be solved like that.
Though to give the man credit, he does do it right some of the time?
When I come out to my dad he said somethings I will not repeat, then said “you wont because it costs to much”
And continues to misgender and deadname me like I never said a thing… so I guess I should shut up…
My realization is I have not talked to him all that much since then… we used to be our closest people… 
Ok, damn this hurt to think about… oof 🏳️‍⚧️♾❤️⚧
Absolutely was meant as a half-joking, “if you’re in a safe position to do this” suggestion because I know how violent and dangerous it can be sometimes, so please know it comes from a “I would absolutely call him your stepdad’s name if I had the chance” place, OP <3
O O F buddy that’s rough. 

My husband just suggested that you can always call them “Mr. StepdadSurname”. But also I’m one of the pettiest people I know so you’re probably not TRYING to be a dick the same way I would be.
Oh yes as long as they are in a safe position to do so I say go for the next time they get misgendered"	pysydx	trans	131	0.98	2021-09-30 21:08:32
Parent misgendering trans daughter at my work		"I work at what is the equivalent to a DMV in the south. This girl came in today to get her learners permit and was absolutely dolled up for her picture (like most teen girls do) and she was there with her mother who kept ""correcting"" me when I referred to her as ""she"" or ""her"" and insisted on calling them he. I'm a Cis gendered man  and being a government worker I can't really say to much back to something like that so I switched to they and them am I the problem?
You did your absolute best in this situation, that girl is likely thankful for what you did.
youre totally not in the wrong but I do feel bad for that girl
Yep I’d have lost my job.
Ah poor kid. I feel awful for her. You did your best OP.
That girl is gonna remember you for the rest of her life I guarantee it. I came out about 6-7 years ago and still remember all the people that did little things to help me earlier on. You did a good job
Glad you tried to help bud 🏳️‍⚧️
Thank you for standing up for this young lady!  You are a hero!
I would have lost the job
You did great! I know it seems like you conceded but to them you definitely stood up for them and I know they’ll remember it!
No. You did what you could. 🖤
not at all, i think u found the best middle ground u could to not upset the daughter but also not make the mother scream at u"	wmx1ss	trans	131	0.98	2022-08-12 21:51:53
MtF, 6+ months HRT. This was how I looked at work today and I still got misgendered. What do I need to fix?		"Girl, you're not far from passing imo.

Maybe look into growing your hair out, styling your eyebrows, maybe wear some lashes? 

Voice and posture are, in my experience, half of the reason for being misgendered. I don't know how you sound, or your mannerisms, but I'm just throwing it out there. Hope this helps! Don't take this the wrong way, but I think your booba cute loll.

I like youre eyeliner too!

Hugs and much love,

Maybe try piercing your ears  and a nice small necklace.
possibly a slightly tighter shirt if you're comfortable with that/if that is allowed at your work, to help show off your figure more? maybe a small bracelet as well? like another user said, maybe a nice small necklace too.
Tuck in your shirt
Try using contour and concealer to make your jaw look smaller. I have opposite issue I want to take hrt and not have anyone notice at work.
Bigots are gonna misgender you regardless of what you do, honey. I say just dress as you feel comfortable. The clothing and makeup that make you see yourself in the mirror and smile. In the end, the only thing important is how you see yourself.
I feel the struggle of growing out curly hair, it takes forever but it’s absolutely worth it in the end. We have a similar curl pattern and I grew mine out from a buzz cut which took around 3 years to get to my shoulders. That said while growing hair, practicing makeup, and shaping the body with clothes are all helpful suggestions a pronoun badge/pin might provide some more immediate relief. At least that way you’d have something for people to look to if they weren’t sure and you have an easy way to correct people.
I do say posture and attitude. Shoulders back little softer in the face. Definetly the shoulders though facial expressions is a very personal thing.
Your job is strange ! nothing is allowed !! Are you working in the space station
What job u in? So many rules
What if you straighten your hair? It will make it seem longer and maybe some fake eyelashes and some contouring? Hope this helped <3
I obviously have no idea how dysphoric you are about your bottom parts but I agree that chin and brow ffs would make a huge difference for you and make you very feminine. If you can live with stuff down there a few more years then do ffs first.
Society.. you look boss girl 🔥
Are you allowed hair accessories at work? Hair takes a long time to grow, but perhaps a feminine headband would make your hair look obviously feminine. Similarly, try altering the parting, etc. r/curlyhair might be able to give some advice.
the male skull shape
I've been growing my hair for 7 months. I wanna get it to below my shoulders, which'll take at least another year.  I'm definitely still working on voice training. And thanks for the comment on my tiddies and eyeliner!!
I've honestly never really thought about piercing my ears tbh. Maybe I'll do that. Earrings have to be small-ish at my work though.
Tight shirts are not allowed, plus, I wear a smock/jacket over it (which is my actual uniform) which is really loose. Like it's so loose that my boobs vanish lol. Bracelets are also prohibited. I have a Star of David necklace that I wear occasionally, but jewelry as a whole is discouraged for all genders.
This, it helps so much with shaping your torso and leaves you less boxy.
I do use concealer, trouble is, I can't go too nuts or my boss will make me take all my makeup off. Makeup has to be minimal at my work, and doing what I have on in this pic is just about the limit of what's acceptable.
Also, in terms of jawline, do you think I'm gonna need FFS? I know I have a really masc jawline but the idea of FFS makes me nervous, though I'm willing to do it if I really need it to pass.
This
It's really not though. My dysphoria is mostly social, so when someone misgenders me, it feels worse than when I don't like what I see in the mirror.
Yeah I've taken to wearing a pronoun pin lately even though I'm technically not allowed to wear pins on my uniform. Doesn't really help, not a single customer has ever noticed it. A coworker asked me my pronouns the other day while wearing it, so I don't think it really helps.
nope lol, I'm a cashier at a grocery store
I'm a cashier at a grocery store
A lot of hair is still short enough that I can't really straighten it well. Might get it done chemically though.
I have really really bad bottom dysphoria, and I'm already talking to surgeons. Haven't even thought about reaching out to surgeons about ffs until last night. I don't even know if there's surgeons in my state that do it, and my insurance only covers procedures in my home state, so I'd have to switch insurances most likely. I'm really really uncomfortable with traveling more than like an hour from home for anything medical
You're welcome. I believe in you! Dont let anyone tell you you're not beautiful. Just let the testicide do its work and by the time your hair is out I'd bet you'll be cute as fuck~ 💜💜
can you wear breastforms at work?
See, I wear a jacket over this as part of my uniform, and it makes me look even boxier. I'm not allowed to modify the jacket at all.
I think so, yeah. You have a fairly square jaw and prominent browline, and I'm not sure you can mitigate that with makeup.

Edit: the good thing though is that you're fine-featured and if you do get FFS, I think it will push you deep into passing territory.
Wow so many rules rho
1) You look great.

2) A little jewelry would help, I think. Some simple earrings, a necklace, maybe some rings or a bracelet. Is it customers misgendering you, or your boss/co-workers? I try to be gentle and patient with strangers & customers like that who don't know me, and assume it's an honest mistake unless it's very open malice, which it definitely also could be if you're clerking retail. Secondary visual cues like jewelry will let the casual randos know you're femme. Since you're working retail I assume they give you a name badge. Can you put your preferred name/pronouns on it? Then if someone does it, just tap the sign.
I can, but 1. I can't afford them, I make $11.50 and hour, and 2. I've had enough breast growth that I think it would be uncomfortable to wear breast forms at this point. I do have a push-up bra with a lot of padding that makes my boobs look way bigger though.
Jacket open or closed? If it's open then fucking in your shirt will still help and the jacket will just frame it differently
well i guess that's something lol. my eyes have always been really kinda sunken. i've always fucking hated it, and i guess now that i've been out for 6-7 months, i know why. 

gotta decide if i want ffs before or after bottom surgery (though i may not have much choice depending on scheduling times and whatever).
yup its a local chain that's been around since 1917 and their rules and dress code are kinda stuck in the 20th century.
It's customers. I do wear a pin that says she/her/hers but no one pays attention. I wear the female uniform and my chosen name is on my nametag cuz it's my legal name now. Jewelry is sadly discouraged by my workplace. I'm allowed 1 ring per hand, no piercings besides my ears (which aren't pierced yet), and a minimalistic necklace, preferably just a chain or maybe a small pendant/locket.
there are small silicon gel based bra inserts that you can get. they work great to give you a little more out of what you got.

i bought a pair for like 20-30$. you have to hand wash them and pat dry them after use though. 

they really helped me a whole lot early on in my transition.

What country? I can’t think anything like that is in finland
I just know I would say something like, ""Listen buddy, I didn't get up early and put my tits on this morning just to be misgendered."" But I don't work in retail for good reasons like that. lol

Just a rant	"I call to get a refill on T a week before i knew i would run out because most of the time they dont have it in stock right? I used my last dose yesterday, so i go in today to pick it up and they claim it never went through and they dont have it and that they're ""sorry"" and ""should have it tomorrow"" all while misgendering me while im PICKING UP TESTOSTERONE and have a TRANS FLAG RIGHT ON MY MASK. I'm on my period, i had a meltdown yesterday and shaved my entire body for some reason (including the small, pathetic facial hair i accumulated from 2 months of T) and now I've been misgendered and told they don't have the only thing that makes me feel okay. Tired of all of this bullshit. I have no binder, no packer and now no facial hair (which was the only thing that remotely suggested i am not a cis female). I dont want to be on this earth rn."	"Oh gosh what a horrible day! I'd hug you if I could
sending you a hug and good vibes
I’m sorry you had to go through that. I wish I could give you a hug. People misgendering you as female is horrible and I wish I could just take some of the pain off of you. It may be hard now but don’t worry you’ll get through this and no one will ever call you a woman again. Stay safe out there and remember that you’re not alone and someone always cares about you.
You're only 2 months in and you already have facial hair? Wow! It took me over a year. I think that's a sign you'll pass very, very soon. And it will definitely grow back. Hang in there."	ugue4c	trans	123	0.97	2022-05-02 17:06:37
"Do sayings like ""Oh boy"" refer to the person you're talking to?"	"Like, if I say, ""Oh boy, shit's fucked up"" does it refer to the person I am talking to?  


examples of these kind of sayings:

* ""Ah, maan!""
* ""Oh boy""

Like, if I say to a girl ""Oh boy, you don't know what you're talking about at all."", is this misgendering or not? Or is it dependent on who interprets it?

These two are really common in my vocabulary alongside dude, and I only basically have transfem friends 😅"	"I wouldn't think so. It almost feels like those phrases use boy/man as soft expletives, akin to ""oh brother"" as opposed to ""oh s***""
No it doesn't 
I've always thought it was kinda like saying ""oh my"" or ""oh shit/damn""
No it’s similar to saying “oh my god” or “oh fuck”. These don’t refer to the person they’re just expressions.
No, unless separated by a comma. Consider ""Oh brother, girl"" which parses close to something like ""Wow that sucks, [close female friend I am listening to]"".
“oh boy”, “man”, “oh lord”, “geeze louise”, et. are all interjections.     
> An Interjection is a word that is used in a sentence to express a strong feeling, emotion, or excitement. Sometimes a noun or an adjective can also function as an interjection. It does not show any relation with the rest of the sentence.

that being said, for someone who’s trans fem (or someone who doesn’t identify with masculinity), hearing “man” at the start of a sentence directed at them might feel bad, even if they understand the meaning. you may want to train yourself away from those interjections, but technically there’s nothing wrong about using them. for myself, it took a very long time for me to be comfortable when people used (gender-neutral, gay slang) “girl”. 

if you are concerned, i would ask your friends directly how they feel and do your best to adjust to that.
Nope
""Oh man"" and ""Oh boy"" are just polite versions of ""Oh shit"" and ""Oh fuck"".  The ""man"" or ""boy"" don't refer to anyone.
As far as I know “Oh boy” is just an exclamation, like “holy cow”, you are not implying the person is a divine bovine so it’s the same
Ima start by saying I am trans fem and having my first gender clinic appointment next Thursday. 

In my opinion, phrases like ‘oh boy’ and ‘dude’ are meant as gender neutral.
It's like saying ""ah man"", it's just an expression that's not referring to anyone. Just a weird anomaly in the English language
I'd say no bit i also use dude and bro and guys and overall terms...
Um... No. Unless you directly direct it at them directly.
I really don’t think so tbh, I don’t know the actual origin of these sayings but something tells me they didn’t have anything to do with the gender of the recipient of the phrase, and were likely just, idk, a fun thing to say, as many things like this nowadays are. So basically: I think you’re fine, dude, especially since you don’t seem to mean it in a misgendering-ish way. If you went out of your way to say it to someone you know to identify as fem, like staring them in the eyes as you put emphasis on the word, that would make you an asshole. As it is, it’s just a thing you say, like how I call everyone “bro” and such!
Try using “Ah, beans” but as others said, you’re good.
If that's true then I sure talk to god a lot for a non-believer.
No.
I'd see it like OMG or something. It's not like you are calling someone a man so I wouldn't worry.
""Oh boy"" is usually used in a expressive manner. To say ""Oh boy, this is fucked up...."" is a way someone gives an exasperation of how saying ""Yikes"" or ""Sheesh"" or ""Oof"". 

I do appreciate that you asked this question, as language is always a funny thing. And it shows you're trying your best not to misgender people c:
I always viewed it as akin ""...Well shit."" or ""Oh Gdi"" or the like.  
Basically just an exclamation which the listener understands as being a certain emotion.

Same with ""...Bruh"" but that is less often regarded as being targeted at nobody in particular.
I see ""Oh boy"" and ""Oh Man"" in the same way you'd use ""Oh Christ"" or ""Jesus"" as expletives,
I don’t think so. I’m pretty sure “Oh boy” is just an exclamation. “Ah, man” I think depends. I’m pretty sure it’s neutral in general, but I suggest thinking a bit about what you’re saying to be absolutely sure.

“Dude” as I have a feeling you know, is not exactly gender neutral. While a lot of people will use it as a neutral, women-aligned people might feel misgendered by it, since it is also masculine
I don't think so, as it's just a phrase, similar to the amount of ""jesus christ""s my pagan ass says in a day.
Not really I think it’s just an expression not meant to gender anything.  Kinda like “oh gosh darn it”.
So men=$#!+ then?  Okay, fair.  

(I’m only making a joke, I just have a strange sense of humor.  I’m amab gender questioning, so in a way I’m making fun of myself while there’s the possibility it still applies to me)
Exactly this
I agree. Most people use the exact same intonation they would if they were swearing to/at the invisible sky daddy.
Yeah I agree. With some people i’ve sorta gone to the extent of making “man” a gender neutral term like “Man that sucks” meanwhile some other friends do not want to be called “dude”.

So like it just comes down to the person you’re talking to But it’s usually safe to say they won’t mind “oh boy”."	s2bgu1	trans	121	0.99	2022-01-12 17:16:09
Work is where I’m most likely to be misgendered.		"I don't know why you would be misgendered. You obviously are and look like a woman.
Wow, you look great.
I bet it happens to a lot of young women in the postal profession. Those outfits aren't tailored and people expect a male carrier (pun somewhat intended).
One close look and they're realize you're a woman through and through.
Oh my god! Y’all are blowing so much smoke up my ass!
Im really sorry. You and your hair are gorgeous!
Misgender them back! Makes just as much sense! 💖

To my fellow trans people.	"To the young trans person struggling right now, I see you and I love you. One day you will be free from the toxicity you're facing at home or in school. One day you will have friends and a found family, people who love you for you. One day you will be thriving, and I can't wait for you to get there. Until then, please know that it gets better, I promise. Until then, please remember that you are in my heart.

To the trans person my age, I see you and I love you. I'm so proud of you for making it this far, and I know you can keep going. Your struggle has been worth it, and it will continue to be worth it. You are so strong, and you are in my heart.

To the old trans person, I see you and I love you. Thank you for fighting to have us be seen, even if it was just through living and loving in your own life. Thank you for paving the way for us, I promise it wasn't in vain, and I promise things will just keep getting better. You are in my heart.

To the trans person questioning or in the closet, I see you and I love you. One day you will be able to live in your truth, and I can't wait for that for you. I know you feel alone, but please know that you aren't. There are so many of us that have gone through the same thing you are, and we are all cheering you on. I am cheering you on, and you are in my heart.

To the trans person who can't afford or doesn't want to go through HRT or surgeries, I see you and I love you. You are no less trans, even if your body doesn't feel right, even if you get deadnamed or misgendered. I know that one day you will love yourself and your body. You are in my heart.

To the trans people who came before us, I see you and I love you. Thank you for not letting war and disease and colonialism erase us. Thank you for giving us a history that spans back farther than we can wrap our heads around. You are in my heart.

To the trans people yet to come, I see you and I love you. I know that our struggles will have been worth it, that the world will keep getting better for people like us with each coming generation. I hope you won't have to go through the things we did, but if you do, I know you'll make it through. You are in my heart."	"I really needed that today

Do I tell my friend?	I'm (20, he/him) a cis guy in college and one of my best friends (21, he/they) is trans. We study the same thing with the same advisor (40 ish? she/her) and she has been really great to us, like super helpful and encouraging. That being said, when my friend isn't with us, she has misgendered him to me several times. I corrected her, but she kinda just laughed awkwardly and moved on. As far as schools go, this a trans-heavy institution and I know he is not her first trans student. Do I tell my friend? She is someone that he really likes, but I feel really weird that she has misgendered him to me. I'm really sorry if this isn't appropriate for this subreddit, happy to delete and repost if there is somewhere better for me to post it, but I'm honestly at a little bit of a loss right now.	"Honestly this is a really tough situation, So i wont give any advice ill just say how i would think! Personally if i really liked someone and they were misgendering me  behind my back id be a little upset if my friends never told me that it was happening. Because i would want to talk to the person about it. I would probably stop liking that person though if they never stopped misgendering me.

Your friend might be different but i always like to know who is genuine and who isn’t. ☺️
Like the other response, I don't want to say this is advice per se, but as for my own preference, even if it would hurt my feelings a lot, I'd be thankful to be told about someone being toxic behind my back. I like knowing who is genuine and who is not. I don't like wasting energy on non-genuine people. I don't like being used.
This might be an unpopular opinion, but if you want to (and let me note that you have absolutely *no* obligation to do this, it would just be a nice thing to do), you should try to explain to your professor why it's hurtful and why she should stop. If this works, tell your friend after it's been resolved. And, if your prof absolutely refuses to, then it's probably best to tell your friend. 

Think about it this way, what function does it serve for your friend to know the truth here (prior to you taking reasonable steps to put a stop to it)? Obviously, knowing the truth can be good, but it kind of just offloads the burden of this whole situation onto him. Now he has to go about and either: (a) ignore it and stew in this new knowledge; (b) confront her, thus possibly roping you in anyways, or; (c) take some other disciplinary action via formal/institutional routes. Either way, he now has the hassle of having to manage this situation himself.

Alternatively, if you don't want to go at this on your own (which is fair), you can tell your friend and suggest that the two of you can come up with ways to try and ameliorate the situation together. This way, they'll know the truth whilst simultaneously having someone they can rely on.

The most important part, though, is supporting them as much as is reasonable for *you*. Don't take on the project of talking to your professor on your own if the prospect of it is unreasonably intimidating or unfeasible for whatever reason. At the end of the day, you've already done (or are planning on doing) what a good friend should do, and that is looking out for your friend in the way you can go about it best. 

Also, I don't know your friend, so take this advice with a grain of salt. If you know your friend is bad at advocating for himself (or doesn't like to) then this strategy is probably preferable, but if he's more of a hot-headed or confrontational type (that likes to take matters into his own hands) then it might be better to opt for the latter option of telling them and working on a resolution together.

Either way, best of luck to the two of you. I hope everything gets resolved, and you're a really great friend for looking out for them.
I personally would want to know if I liked and trusted people who were hiding their transphobia from me. I wouldn't want my friends to ""...praise me...""* to my face ""...and make an ass of me...""* behind my back. Wouldn't want to be like the poor clown in Shakespeare's Twelfth-Night. Best to be better for your friends, not worse for them. 

*Shakespeare, Twelfth-Night, act V, scene I.
This is sad tbh. Nobody here will give you advice but I will, TELL HIM. I’d also tell the advisor that your comments actually hurt and offended you. You felt pain for your friend. This is why I don’t tell people I’m trans, I get attached to people and if and when they find out I’m trans then they say some transphobic shit or treat me differently and BAM they just lost the honor of having me as a friend. I just keep my distance from people now, I assume everyone is transphobic and mind my stealth cishet business. It’s lonely but I’d rather be alone than constantly soothing new wounds.
usually, id recommend NOT telling the person being misgendered about it, as saying ""hey ___ misgendered you"" usually isnt conducive to anything and only makes the trans person upset - usually this just applies to an accidental misgendering vs on purpose. However, this is a person in a position of power who also seems to be doing it on purpose. I would tell your friend, but I also understand not wanting to stress them out
Hmmm. If she knows he is trans and the correct pronouns be a good ally and tell your advisor alone. Correct her. No need to tell your friend and make him feel bad. And it reads like this is the case (that she knows)
I would try to solve it with the professor first. As others have mentioned, try to explain to her how harmful it is, and why she needs to stop.

If she refuses though, it would be polite to inform him. It’s like letting someone know a rumor is being spread about them. If you can’t fix the problem, let them know so that they can fix the problem.
Please update us with how it goes.

I feel this situation could sadly be common enough that a follow up would be beneficial for others.
probably unpopular opinion, but the point of not misgendering someone is to not hurt, to be polite, it has no intrinsical value, hell even gender itself is constructed, in my country we don't have gender specific pronoun, it's just a one word to everyone no matter what gender is, and ussually we dont even use it, we use the name instead, let's say her name is Christa, when we talk about you we dont use the she/her version of my languange, instead we use her name, and many people who isn't native probably strugling in this ""pronoun"" rules, but it's a clarity for my friend who misgender someone and they point it out, then he apologize to the said person, and they was cool with that, but the point is to not be rude, if ur advisor dont misgender them in front of them, what's the point of tellin him? it's counter-productive in their study, except they have personal non professional relationship with the advisor,   


so different game when it's a friend or a circle, YOU SHOULD DEFINITELY TELL THEM, we have to protect our friends from a bad friends, whether it's a sexist one, transphobe, homophobe,   
it'll hurt them if they are already close and only to late to know that the person is talking shit behind their back, but back again to the advisor, i'd say you don't have to tell them.
tysm that makes a lot of sense. he's someone who really appreciates people being real and this is something to definitely think about.
Agreed on everything in this response! Also today I learned the word “ameliorate” and that’s super cool!
thats a really good perspective, thank you! he's one of her favorite students, like they get along really well and she isn't weird to him in class so that's definitely something i should be considering"	tc9zmu	trans	116	1.0	2022-03-12 06:09:02
"My cishet sister told me (trans masc) she knows what it's like being trans because she's ""an empath"""	"Okay for context, I'm bi trans masculine and 21, my sister is cishet and 26. So it's not like she's some 13 year old saying this shit on a whim cuz she heard it on TikTok. Basically, the other day i had a pretty heavy argument with my sister because I said that I don't have a good relationship with my parents because they constantly misgender me, express disapproval towards gay people and are just overall ignorant. And my sister kept insisting that i should just talk it out with them because it's bad to be at odds with your parents because they're family. She had actually cut them off some years ago cuz they disapproved of her boyfriend but she eventually talked it out with them and is in good terms. So she kept insisting that her methods would work just with me. And i told her that our parents disapproving of her boyfriend is completely different from them completely invalidating and attacking an identity that i was born with and cannot choose. We eventually started going back and forth and i said that the argument was going nowhere because she's cishet, she's an outsider to the LGBT+ community, so she can't understand what homophobia and transphobia feel like. And she seemed so offended, saying how she reads all about trans issues and knows the struggles. So i said that she can be as educated as she wants on transphobia but will never have to actually *live* it because she's cishet. And finally she snapped and said ""you know, I'm an empath. I can understand and feel transphobia. I know what it's like""

I'm sorry *what*???????? It took everything in my power not to lose my mind. She claims she's an ally and said has been ""nothing but supportive"" towards me (yet has never used my correct pronouns and says she's fine with gay people ""but not the ones that are too obvious and shove it in your face"") but then goes on to spew bullshit like this. Like, why is it that supposed cishet ""allies"" get so offended when you tell them they're not part of the queer community??? It's true. They can feel sympathetic towards us and even angry that trans/homophobia exists but they're never going to experience it first hand. It's been like 2 weeks since my sister said that and i have not spoken to her since. I'm trying to move on but I just cannot wrap my head around how a grown ass woman can believe she's an empath and can understand the trans experience. I almost wanted to tell her ""you've been watching too many TikToks"". We're immigrants and POC and she's a woman so she knows what racial discrimination and misogyny feel like but she's also married to a wealthy white cishet man, is a housewife by choice and she's cishet herself so she has a very limited experience with transphobia and homophobia. Especially the shit that low-income queer people have to go through, like medical, housing and employment discrimination rooted in trans/homophobia. 

Her and her husband are rather popular online and she likes to say how liberal and open-minded she is. If only her followers knew she actually says this kind of shit."	"Does she use healing crystals or whatever too?  

The whole “empath” thing sounds like the kind of person with too much time on their hands that wants to be special would say.

I’m so sorry about your sister.  You can never convince people that believe they hold some kind of mystic powers.
Omg sorry but yeah this really sounds like so much bullshit 😅😅😅 you're totally right, she can't know what it feels like until she actually experiences it. Her reaction should have been ""you're right, I cannot know what it feels, but I'm 100% with you and I want to do anything I can to support you"" and actually DO the things you would ask her to do, like gendering you correctly and using the right pronoun. The whole ""I'm an empath"" thing does sound like she's living in a tiktok bubble, or at the very least in a bubble that's not reality. I'm so sorry that you have to deal with this! I had a fight with my PhD colleague recently too, she basically said that she genders people according to their genitals... And then she claims that she's supportive and all haha. So I feel you! Being a family member must be even more horrible though :( I hope your sister gets more open-minded at some point, hopefully soon! In the meantime, good luck and take care :)
If she was really empathic, she'd have known not to say something so invalidating
god i hate empaths

it's just another word for ""dickhead who projects their own emotions onto you and decides what you must feel"". not to mention how ableist they are to people who have lower levels of empathy
I  so sorry 😂😂 I thought all that empath stuff was a big joke, oh noooooo, that sucks so hard. Cishet people be like that sometimes, some stranger said to me she knew the pain of being gay because her cousin was gay, like, really? Anyways you don't owe your parents shit, if they keep treating you like that give them an ultimatum. Either start making an effort or stop seeing their kid. 

As for your sister, write down what you want to say to her. Have some rough drafts, be clear and concise. Use a lot of ""I am"" sentences. ""When you say.... I am.... Because...."" Be gentle, but be firm. 

Something that might help with someone who is cis but can ""feel"" being trans, write down what you feel when you're misgendered by a stranger, then by your parents. If you're not a writer it might take a few tries to get right, but write it all down. THEN, you ask her to tell you what SHE feels is the trans experience. Be patient, listen. Grit your teeth, whatever you have to do. When she gets it wrong, take out your writing, and either read it to her, or let her read it. If you need some help or examples, PM me, or look on this subreddit some more, maybe make a post asking for more people to help you out (with their permission to use their words). If a trans person writes exactly how you feel, there's nothing wrong with using their words to try and reason with you sister. 

The reason you're writing everything down is so you don't get your words mixed up in the moment. It's to keep emotions down and things calm. For her case specifically, it's so you don't ""change your answer"" after she tries to prove she's an empath. 

Another thing, make this a sit down, make sure she knows you want to talk to her about things and that it really hurt you when she said that. This shouldn't be a surprise thrown at her, it should be an invitation to talk. Make it a lunch or dinner and talk afterwards (afterwards. You don't want to talk when you're hungry, the conversation could go long, if it's messy you don't want to eat with a sour stomach, that kind of stuff) as a side note, you might not want to mention it's about the trans thing because she could ""do her research"" and copy a trans person's words and read them verbatim. Just say you want to have a heart to heart.

Cis people do this thing where they mention how hard it is for THEM that YOU'RE trans, so have a (calm) response prepared. Again, write it down. You don't have to read off your writings like a script. Use them as reference, like if you find yourself getting upset or frustrated, refer back to them. 

Another tidbit of advice is, if possible, to have a third party. When doing some grout work with a relationship, it can be helpful to have a type of moderator. A neutral party that both of you know, I wouldn't use her boyfriend since he'll likely be unable to be impartial. Their job is to keep things at an even pace, emotions calm, and call out unreasonable bullshit. You might not want a third party. And that's fine too. It's just something I've used before that helps. 

There's a few ways this can go, best case scenario she sees how wrong she's been etc etc. She might need time to think on it, that's probably the most neutral outcome, and of course there's always a chance she's going to make it all about her and try to flip the table on you and make you feel guilty. I have never had that happen to me when I have done one of these sit downs. Sometimes the person will start to do that, but usually with enough talking it calms down.

I feel it's worth mentioning I'm trans masc too, if that helps(?) But in short, write down what you want to say. Keep things calm. Even if she starts yelling, keep it cool. PM me if you want, and good luck. Sorry I wrote so much 😳
I'm so sorry to hear this and obviously, I completely agree with you. Your sister's reaction was a classic stereotype - someone who is transphobic and homophobic but says otherwise. If she was a true empath she would have to acknowledge this somehow, a lot of people in our community have experienced it.

You mentioned she and her husband are popular on social media. If you speak to her about this again you might want to ask her if she would post what she said to you online.

I wish you the best and lots of love.
lol literal irl meme
Your sister is an attention seeking genetic defect
This made me laugh so hard.

Then I read the article content and my mirth disappeared. The only way I could think would be via an example. Take a skill that you know how to do, ask her to read up about it until she is confident she can do it well, then take her to go and do it with you. Explain to her after she fails to do it as well as you that experience is important. You can feel empathy for others and attempt to understand their struggles, but unless you experience it specifically you don't really understand. It is the same with learning a skill you can read all you want but you'll never be any good until you practice.

A less intensive way to do this would be to ask her to do a backflip. When she says she cant, aske her why, she understands how to do one, so why can't she do it?
I literally hate bringing this up because it sounds so pretentious, but my psychiatrist has told me I'm an empath, and for me at least, when say I see someone crying, I begin crying too. I am good at putting myself in others positions and somewhat understanding how they are feeling. Obviously though, something like dysphoria I imagine is very hard to understand for people who don't experience it, but I do wanna say that maybe she can imagine the general feeling of not being comfortable with certain aspects/features of yourself because of your gender, and get a general feeling of sadness. 

But like, honestly, I know how fucking invalidating it must feel for a cishet person to tell you they know how you feel, after everything you've gone through. If she actually could feel empathy on a higher level, she would've understood how you would feel when she said something like that, and would apologize, or just not say it in the first place.

I've seen a spike in the amount of use the word empath gets recently, especially on tik tok, so I assume a lot of people are just assuming they are an empath because they have the ability to feel empathy, which obviously isn't true, it's just people who can especially relate to and feel others feelings, despite them not experiencing it themselves.
Lol what, that's not how any of this works. That's not empathy, that's pretentious BS.
The irony is that she said to me ""you're not that special"" when i told her that some experience are unique to queer people.....
Please don't generalize an entire group of people, I would hope at least people in this community people would be more accepting, but I guess not, bigotry lies everywhere. 

I definitely understand the notion of hating people who act like they know all your problems and can feel them exactly how you do, because that's literally impossible. Extreme empathy will never reach the level of personal experience, so people who act like they can do that are assholes.

Also, saying empaths are ableist to people who have a harder time feeling empathy is like saying people who aren't physically impaired are ableist to those who are, just for existing."	s6g5ak	trans	117	0.98	2022-01-17 21:58:08
Hi Friends (TW: Misgendering, Overall Rudeness)	"I'm sure that no one will see this, honestly I just want to rant, I came out to my dad as trans today, to which he promptly responded ""no you're not...you were born a boy, you are a straight boy..."" And then also said that ""transgender doesn't exist"" with a whole other barrage of awful things. I wish I could rant about all of it but a lot of it was very personal stuff not related to being trans. I'm not sure where else I was going with this, but I just wanted to rant to people I would hope understand at least a little. If this has taught me anything, it's that I AM trans, and I refuse to be snuffed out by him. Thanks for letting me rant friends"	"Sorry your dad is like that hang in there girl
You are beautiful. Family is not blood but people who support you and are with you unconditionally no matter what
I spent about 2-3 weeks last month in agony over some similar conversation with my parents, though not quite that harsh. It's certainly harder when you're living at home still. Previous generations don't understand us. And that which is misunderstood is often spat on, rejected and explained away so that ideals don't have to change in accordance to new information. We're destroying foundational ideas by simply acknowledging that our feelings exist. For now you need friends. I certainly hope you have someone close that you're out to. Being alone is the hardest thing in the world. You have my best wishes.
With all due respect; f*ck your dad...
Do what your heart tells you, do the right thing for you. It's your life, not his and he deserves no control over it.
I feel you. My dad did something similar. I just let him know that I wasn't asking for his permission.
I would feel terrible if my parents said that when I come out, I feel for you.
Oh babe, I'm so so sorry you had to experience that. 😕 Don't let him get to you, you are who you are, no matter what he says or thinks or wants.
❤️
Well then he’s totally not worth it. You ain’t no boy. How the heck are you a boy.
My dad was the same way; he called me a tranny, sent me half a dozen videos on detransitioning, said I should go to conversion therapy, and called me a Satan worshipper. 

I cut him out of my life after a year of trying to let him see what was wrong with what he was saying. If you’re dad doesn’t get his act together, you ought to cut him out of your life too.
I agree with this you are a girl and your dad is an ass!"	miztyg	trans	115	0.98	2021-04-03 02:50:33
Fear of outing Trans friend by accident	So recently my friend came out to me as a trans guy and unfortunately I’ve had to use his dead name and misgender him around people who knew him before he came out they don’t know he’s trans and the worst part is I have a mutual friend with some of these people with the same name my friend chose so I can’t pretend it’s someone else and I don’t want  to come off unsupportive but I just don’t want to accidentally out my friend to people he doesn’t want knowing and I need to know if this is offensive to my friend.	"Ask them how they would like you to address them to other people. 
Personally I rather not have the conversation with everyone I meet. so if you could have that convo for me and save me those awkward moments great but definitely ask them tho .
You sound a lot like my friend honestly, she’s super supportive too. I think asking your friend abt it would be the best thing, they might prefer tht u not let everyone know just yet, Bc Thts how I was at first too! But def talk to them abt it.
Ask him how he wants you to adress him around people who don't know, one of my friends uses my deadname and misgenders me at work around customers cos i haven't started any medical procedures yet
maybe you could agree on a nickname or a shortened form of his name to use around others? I have really transphobic parents, and my brother and I agreed to use our initials or shortened versions of our chosen names as nicknames around them.
Ok thank you for the advice!
Alright I will
Alright I’ll talk to him about that
Or if they don't want to be outed you could come up with a nickname that's like.. kinda andro or just non-gendered like blue eyes or sumin
Of course I hope it’s helpful"	slqe82	trans	111	0.99	2022-02-06 06:53:55
2 months on t, never been misgendered so much. Drew my frustrations.		"Felt this. I've noticed it's mostly women that misgender me men don't. I'm only a month on T but my voice was pretty androgynous to begin with. It's just annoying.
Read my post on my profile, your not alone, I am still pre hrt at this moment but I had a hell of a bad experience with Misgendering. Think it might help.
I feel that with the misgendering I'm not on t  yet but when I feel like I'm almost passing then... misgendered again

"Maybe this is a controversial take, but I'm not super comfortable with the bevvy of ""guess my gender"" posts."	"Basically the title; I worry that it may reinforce some of the problems around passing.  I hope we can get to a point someday where we don't assume gender like we do now, and asking people to make those assumptions feels... counterproductive, I suppose.  Not to mention I would hate to misgender people, and if I'm misinterpreting how someone is presenting themself I don't want to cause that discomfort to anyone.  I also feel that this trend is distinct from ""do I pass,"" since that seems like it would lend itself better to feedback and advice, while this particular trend asks that benefit.  I understand that getting read correctly can be a boon for euphoria, but I don't think that's without cost in this case."	"Yeah i always back away from those post because i know i would hate myself to get mis-gendered even if it was in good faith and i would hate to do it to others too
I just scanned the recent posts to make a similar post if no one had already. I’m glad I’m not the only one who feels this way. This practice will absolutely teach burgeoning people early on their journey of self discovery terrible self confidence, and possibly discourage people from transitioning! There are a lot of harmful things that can be taken from these kinds of posts. For one, everyone is different, and some features are unique to some individuals. 


It is incredibly difficult for some people to imagine how they could look post transition. I think some people post the “do I pass?” posts knowing that by typical cis-het societal standards they absolutely do. However, by being coy and asking if they do, they’re implying that they might not, and to someone struggling to even imagine how their authentic self might look and feel, and seeing someone else who looks so amazing still struggling with “passing,” it can be very discouraging. If the person posting is feeing very dysphoric and maybe looking for validation, in my experience such posts do not help at all. If anything, they promote more feelings of imposter syndrome. 


I cannot stand the posts where people ask you to guess their gender. Gender is a social construct and, depending on your experience in the world, any two people may react completely differently. Are you going to go count the guesses in the comments? If your goal is androgyny, I supposed mixed results might be positive. All you’re doing is opening yourself up to be hurt, and others to feel badly when they guess incorrectly. 


If you are content with how you look, I’m so happy for you, and I hope everyone can get to that point. In a sub like this, where so many people are at different points in their journey, many are just getting started, while many of us have been on our journey for YEARS, and make these posts without any context for how long and hard their journey has been. It can make it look like an impossible dream. Everything. seems so easy for you, why is it so hard for me to take the first steps? Am I valid? Etc. 


Also, I believe passing is so much more complicated than “do or don’t,” and that’s something nobody explained to me and I’m hard pressed to find anyone ever talking about it. Passing to every person in the world wouldn’t mean anything if you don’t love yourself. And if that sounds like bullshit, you have a lot of work to do in accepting yourself. I know I still do, and I thought that sentiment was bs until pretty recently. There are cis people who get “clocked” for the same reasons we do, and plenty who seek gender affirming care, too. There are no master lists for how to pass as x gender, and putting effort into chasing some standard that’s always changing depending on the person is thankless, unfruitful, and exhausting. Getting treated by others how you want to be treated is important, but not as important as how you treat yourself. Gender, like many things, is very complicated. Posts like those are reductive of our experiences and harmful.
I feel the same way! I get why people do them, but it doesn't help anything really.
Well put.

A lot of those doing it are youngsters who might not realize it can be upsetting to see for a lot of us. There are so many unhealthy beauty standards that so many trans folk adopt from their cis peers that really are harmful on that side of the line too. Honestly I have considered just dropping off this sub as it seems like most of the posts I get bombed with are folk looking for validation on the stuff I have to routinely tell myself doesn't matter so I don't go crazy. 

I have much better conversations surrounding the quintessential philosophy of mitigating self harm through image over on other subs.
I think the framing is the worst of it. It’s kind of a loaded question that is at least 50% likely to give a negative reaction to the poster.

I think asking for specific feedback “what can I do to make my eyebrows look more feminine.” Is a much healthier approach than broad and generic “gender me” or “do I pass” posts.
I feel really uncomfortable with those posts. I don't want to hurt anyone's feelings. 

""Do I pass as (gender)? Are there ways I could pass closer to (gender)?"" seems more productive if you're asking for advice on passing. 

On the same theme, I'm tired of timelines that are done backwards and don't clarify which direction they're going.
Its definitely a double edged sword. Because we don't want to be misgendered. But, at the same time we are also asking people.

There are a lot of double edged swords unfortunately when it comes to stuff like this. Unfortunately there are always going to be people not wanting to be misgendered but also want affirmation by asking people to guess. 

I don't like playing guessing games because I have seen how people get treated if they guess wrong. So I stay away from them even when I look at a post asking ""how do I look"" if they don't specify because unfortunately IT ISNT AlWAYS OBVIOUS. So I try to use neutral words like ""you look great!"" rather then handsome/beautiful etc etc. But if its specified then I use these words. 

(Of course I know they shouldn't have to specify but its a double edged sword if they specify it can make them feel bad. If they don't it goes back to this guess my gender problem where if you don't guess right your basically gonna get the shit stick.)
Many people fib in the replies too.
I'm also thinking of leaving this sub and another trans sub. This one, due to the reason mentioned in the post and the ""do I pass?"" posts. I'm 29 but still early in my transition and it just... It doesn't upset me but it does something negative to my state of mind. I guess it reminds me that I'm struggling with stuff and I just try and crack on. I'll get to where I feel comfortable eventually but those posts remind me I'm not comfortable yet. Siiiigh."	qudoi7	trans	113	0.97	2021-11-15 10:43:03
Does anyone ever expect you to get extremely angry or even violent over pronouns?	"Friends and family who I have known for years will say things like ""just don't yell at me when I mess up."" I've had situations where I've been with a friend and a stranger misgenders me, and my friend will turn to me and say ""I thought you were going to attack that guy."" When I ask them why they expect me to respond like this, no one has an answer."	"yeah. i mean, i think it comes a lot from how trans people are shown online and all that. there’s such a stereotype of trans people yelling at or hitting people for assuming their gender. I see it all the time and it’s irritating. the amount of fake stories i see everyday about the “Crazy Transgendered who assaulted me and put me in the hospital because i said she instead of he one time :’(“ are so annoying, and have made for such a narrative to be spread about us.
I'm not really sure if anyone expects anger from me, but one friend makes such a big deal about pointing out when he misgenders me. I always just say that it's ok & I can tell an honest mistake from an intentional jab, but I would appreciate a simple correction instead of making a big deal about it
yeah. also when people i know say its hard to rememember my pronouns? I don't think i actually believe them.
Yeah. A lot of times this has happened. My mom's boyfriend keeps bringing up ""Oh if I mess up, just know I'm not trying to attack you."" I even heard a group of students talking to my theater teacher about stories they heard about trans students losing their crap over being called the wrong pronouns, and I just wanted to but in and say ""bro I don't even correct people-""
i get told im dramatic and its not that big a deal i was told earlier that ""when ur in elamentary school girls use female terms for us so i know what its like"" and iv been told that were snowflakes and were to sensative. i get that its hard i really do BUT YOU NEED TO FUCKING TRY there is only so many god damn times i can get misgenders by people who fucking know my prounouns. i wake up and im constantly fucking misgenderd by my parents i go to school and am constantly misgendered by teachers and students. the only fucking place my prounouns get used are with online friends. and its not like ppl in my life dont know my prounouns!!!!! they all know them AND SOME OF THEM HAVE KNOWN FOR ALMOST 2 FUCKING YEARS OR MORE I DONT HAVE TO FUCKING FEEL BAD FOR YOU SHUT UP AND USE MY PROUNOUNS.
Not angry but I can tell certain people are anxious as hell that if they ask wrong or accidentally assume that I might flip. I think people who follow mainstream news are convinced all gnc people are a bunch of raving lunatics, so I’m enjoying disabusing them of that notion.
I mean, hate to sound stereotypical but I do get pretty peeved when someone calls me ""sir"", but I think I just hate the word. 
Always have even when male.
I'm not gonna rage about it, but it does put me in a very annoyed and dismissive state of mind with that person. Then I get sad.
The only people I ever really get disappointed with are my parents, because they've known for >8 years now and they really should have started when I was 22, not trying only within the last couple years now that I've started transitioning*

* They wouldn't let me transition while I was living under their roof, and guess who didn't get paid well enough to leave their house until about 4 years ago...
i've never been expected to be violent, just the usual ""but it's so hard, be patient"" coming from people who've had much more than enough time to at least try and are really just saying it to continue being a piece of shit.

I feel the ""just don't yell at me"" thing is trying to guilt you for being mad about being misgendered, regardless of whether you'd actually yell or not. I guess it translates to ""don't be mad at me if I get it wrong. Also, I won't even try to get it right."".
People often act the same way when they misgender me. I’m five feet tall and non violent, but they still make statements like that. 

So as someone else has mentioned I believe it’s due to how media portrays transgender individuals. 

A way I’ve learned to combat the comments is I say “would you like me to yell at you?” Which usually gets an awkward “no” to which I respond “well good cause I wasn’t planning on it and I don’t want to” 

It’s made some repeat offenders stop saying that when they misgender or hear others misgender me.
I'm absolutely terrified of correcting people. I've had cis people laugh in my face and even get physical. I am way more likely to just let it pass because I am more scared of them
People don't expect me to get hostile about it but they should because that is totally in my character if someone does something that annoys me I shout and sometimes throw things
I've just seen people react so badly with pronouns and deadnames, even when for the most part it's an accident. Because of overreactions, people characterize trans people as being really anal and prone to throwing hissy fits over pronouns.

There's fault on both sides.
Well. I am mostly in the closet and don't really have preferred pronouns but I had to listen to people misgendering a different transgender person and every time I hear it I simply misgender a person who started that. I suspect I would do the same if I was misgendered


Unfortunately where I live people don't have any respect for trans people and think it's a choice and that their opinion about who trans people are matter in terms of how much trans people are valid so if I were to lose temper I would be ostracized
I was thinking that this was the reason or at least part of it. I guess I was just expecting these people to know how docile and non-confrontational I am by now
Meanwhile, the one video I saw was basically just a trans woman getting harassed in public and snapping back.
That's understandable. I have a vaguely similar experience. I had one friend who was almost ""too supportive"". I don't think they ever actually misgendered me, but they would greet me like ""hey, my dude, man friend, [chosen name], how's it going?"" I completely understand that there was no ill intent, but it still made me uncomfortable
Yeah because that's annoying their making a mountain out of a molehill there's a Scottish proverb my papa used to say when I overreacted about something ""Chan eil tuil air nach tig traoghadh"" which translates into English from Scots gaelic as ""there isn't a flood which will not subside"" I'm not sure exactly how accurate it is but I guess it is it's saying it's no big deal
Yeah that is really annoying. I get it from some co workers. They'll say my deadname or say ""yeah man"" or something and be like ""oh God sorry sorry sorry, oh man I messed up, I mean I didn't mean to, oh damn are you ok, I'll do better next time"" and I'm just like... If you notice it just correct and move on Holy shit dude. I'm not gonna pop like a balloon
I have one family member who keeps ""forgetting"" even tho its been like 4 or 5 years. I've started actually yelling at them every time.
I wouldn't believe them either. Unless, you use neopronouns then I might get it
I don't think they are trying to guilt me because that line is normally their initial reaction to me coming out. I'm not usually an aggressive or angry person, so they're just pulling me reaction out of their ass. I have gotten the ""it's so hard, be patient"". Most of the time when people say that I agree that it doesn't even feel like they are trying. In one instance, I explained to the person how awful being misgendered felt, and that this one action could make my life more bearable. They messed up a lot less after that
The ""I'm five feet tall and nonviolent"" is hilarious. That's a pretty good response, though
Are you talking about the Gamestop ma'am woman
What's even more annoying is when repeat offenders claim ""it was accidental"" after and then act all hurt when they get blown up on.
I'm Irish the langue is the same, yes that's a pretty good translation. Good for you for remembering. I'm what you would call a cis mom. I miss spoke twice and said the wrong gender to a trans man ands a trans girl in a store on different occasions .But when i realized i apologized and used the correct gender. I were bi focals and am middle aged. being polite and correcting our selves doesn't cost anything. I think some people are just naturally rude.
I think it comes from people thinking we're all overly sensitive delicate snowflakes which couldn't be further from the truth I mean I've gotten into plenty of arguments criticising the left
this. we dont yell at the bus driver who intentionally disregards our presentation. we may yell at our close family members who act like dicks for years on end!
totally! I'm just she her. for 9 months. it hurts!
hmmm, yeah makes sense... Then maybe it's just some weird asf trans stereotype media has spread among people ://

I'm glad they do it a lot less after you explained! ideal would be not at all, though. It's not as hard as people make it out as, my mains have known me for 2-8 years prior to me to coming out, and I don't pass at all, but only one of them has ever messed up, and it was once...
Yeah
It's not the same it's very similar but slightly different
""Forgetting pronouns"" implies a lack of intentionality, which unfortunately means that people are actively resisting viewing you the way you ask to be viewed. It's frustrating because it's a small ask but people are still so resistant to even try. 😔
I actually remember when I first saw that I was thinking why is this prick calling that woman sir because I didn't fully understand what transgender was until I was about 14 15
hey theres 7 billion people, if i have to find new ones im willing
Yeah, if you have literally any sympathy for trans people whatsoever, it's pretty clear that the GameStop lady isn't just blowing up at someone out of nowhere. They basically just don't think trans people get to be human beings with feelings.
Yeah it's so annoying I think because of my explosive temper I'd lose it if I was misgendered"	n65n7l	trans	107	0.97	2021-05-06 12:01:28
"I have to ""clarify"" that I'm a girl because I'm closeted"	"Yesterday I was in school with my best friend and this guy comes up to me and asks ""I'm sorry, but are you a girl or a boy? My sister says you're a girl, but you're a guy, right?"" and it made me happy that OMFG I PASSED AS A GUY, HE WAS ONLY CONFUSED BECAUSE HIS SISTER SAID I WASN'T A GUY. I don't want my friend or anyone to know, and if I'd just told him, then he'd tell his sister who's friends with my sister and then my family would know. So I had to answer ""girl"". Then my friesn went on to talk about ""just because SHE has short hair doesn't mean SHE'S a boy"" and yes, that's true but she didn't need to say that and yes, it's not really her fault, because I haven't told her even when she's asked.

And whenever someone says HE or HIM people ""correct"" them. Which, yes, correctung someone for misgendering is a good thing, but it's just mad when I'm not being misgendered. It's all backwards and upside down. 

I don't know, its just so frustrating that it happens a lot. I have to say I'm a girl beacue people keep asking and I don't want to out myself. The people I don't blame for asking me is little kids, because kids are curious like that. But WHY DOES IT CONSERN ANYONE OVER THE AGE OF 10 WHAT MY GENDER IS???

TL:DR I have to say that I'm a girl because people keep asking and I don't wanna out myself and that sucks."	"I remember during my last year of high school when my hair was getting really long and people were noticing. I wanted to say what was up but I couldn’t. Not an easy place to be in. One day at a time.
“Are you a boy or a girl” “perhaps” is how I’d deal with it
That happened to me in my math class this semester. Literally everyone there used he/him pronouns for me even though when attendance was called for the first time I answered to my deadname, quietly, and no one noticed so I let them go with it. Best class by far
I feel you.

In my language, most nouns referring to people (especially jobs but also many others) have a feminine ending when referring to women or girls ut are otherwise generically masculine and I have that one friend who always corrects people who use the masculine ending for a female person. I appreciate him being against the generic masculine form of words and it's not his fault because I'm not out, but could he please stop correcting people when they refer to me with a masculine word?
In the future you can always just say 'it's none of your business'.
That sounds confusing and hard to navigate. I hope you can be out soon! It’s so unpleasant misgendering yourself.

Be patient with people’s curiosity and confusion. It’ll wear you down so fast. I’m guessing you want to correctly gender others and to interact with them as they’d prefer. Some people will share that desire, and some people are taught to be assholes. It can be hard to tell the difference, but giving the benefit of the doubt can help you feel less surrounded by 💩 people
You are who you are. People are like that. I’ve been through many instances like that. I don’t have to explain myself, you can see I have boobs. Some people are just ignorant.
Yeah, I feel you. I just want to tell people now that I've  finally figured it out. But yeah, one day at a time.
Or a classic ""good question!"" Followed by unending silence.

My dad finally began to accept me as a daughter ♥	"MtF, six months into HRT. These past six months have held more joy and meaning for me than the past entire twelve years of my life combined, and my previous depressed, neurotic, constantly-anxious demeanor is almost nowhere to be seen. Whenever I get dressed, I care about what I'm wearing now. When I see my face in the mirror, even with its fair share of dysphoric facial stubble that I can't ever get fully rid of, my heart sings and I think I look cute instead of repulsive. I even got my legal name changed to Akari and I literally have never felt happier.

Thoughout all this, Dad has been considerably less enthused. He's always claimed ""all he wants is for me to be happy"", but it had always seemed tired and half-hearted. His response to seeing me in my black mesh and frills was ""hope it's everything you wanted"". His response to my name change was ""I'm glad you finished your task you set out to do"". My elation at my progress seemed entirely irrelevant to him up to now.

But last night is when I felt like that's starting to change. He came into my room last night and said something that made me kinda start to cry-- he said that he's ""noticed how much happier and more lively I've been these past few months, and that he's genuinely relieved and grateful to see that"".

He added that he ""still doesn't understand why I would transition, or what I hope to gain out of it, but that he's glad I went through with it since it's been such a positive thing"".

And he referred to me as Akari!! It is the first encounter we have thus far had where he hasn't forgotten not to deadname or misgender me.

I was so shocked and touched by that that I got up and went ""here you get another one"" (I had hugged him previously when he came home from work that night) and just squeezed him as hard as I could while tearing up

I told him I love him and am grateful to have him \>\/\/\<

Another thing he said was that ""all his life that he's been a kid, and a teenager, and an adult, there have only been two genders in his world view and the world view of everyone around him"" (he actually did reference native-American two-spirits as well as Thailand's kathoeys as examples that this has been around longer than he has, and acknowledges it-- my dad is extremely scholarly \^\^), and that for him this isn't a five-foot step away from before, it is more like a leap across an entire city, but that he's getting there and starting to see that it's something to value.

I really love my dad. Even my mom, who has been even less kind about it (the line ""god gave me a son, not a daughter"" will always stick in my head-- my dad is very anti-religious so his was really just more pragmatism). Even if the whole rest of the world would accept and validate me, it wouldn't mean nearly as much if my parents never would. So I \*needed\* this. I'm so happy. It finally feels like my dad has my back through this, even if he doesn't completely ""get it"". And I'm more than happy to talk with him and help him understand further.

For everyone still struggling to be accepted by their families here: stick with it. Talk to them, be open, as much as you feel comfortable. Do what you can to meet them halfway, with patience in your heart. Obviously everyone's situations differ, but I truly believe Love Conquers All in the end if we allow love into our lives and interactions, despite generational world view differences."	"Thanks, Akari!! This is such an uplifting story. I’m having some similarities difficulties with my extended family and your story gives me a bit of hope.
This is wonderful, Akari. I hope your mom sees how happy you are as yourself as well
You're never alone.
Well unfortunately she thinks most forms of happiness are just sinful temptation and thus anti-god, which I'm sure applies to gender euphoria as well >_>

Her hatred no longer holds power over me, though

I’m a trans single mom. Kids are being told to deadname/misgender me.	sometimes I need my parents help for babysitting. my parents don’t support me and have recently taken to yelling at and “correcting” my kids when they use my correct pronouns/name. I can’t afford a real babysitter I don’t have anyone else to turn to I’m going back to school. What’s worse is I’m probably going to have to move in with them till I finish school. this sucks. I’m providing emotional and physical support for a two and four year old and I have no one and nothing to support me. I’m overwhelmed and exhausted and feel like I’m fighting a battle every day just to feel like myself. Blah.	"What the hell is wrong with some people! For crying out loud, your parents need a kick to the head. You’re their child, what else should matter; and they respond by trying to get your own children to be transphobic against you. If you were in WA, you would have a free babysitter who also comes with a teaching license. I really got to figure out how to be everywhere at once. There is so much goddamn bigotry out there, it makes me want to tear my hair out!!!
I hope the best for you. Wish i had advice, but if anything i hope your kids can be taught to address you properly when your parents aren't around.
I'm in a almost identical situation, if you want to talk about it feel free to DM me.
Tell them to misgender your parents back. Your parents have taught them to misgender trans people, they should be expected to have tolerance against their own teachings.
I have no words except I love you and I'll send you a great big supportive hug. You keep raising your kids gently with lots of love and kindness and support that you aren't being shown and they'll know what's real. They'll love and respect you. It will be worth the struggle when you are on your own feet with your children that will understand what their mother suffered through for them. It's sad that they'll have to learn that,but they will
Thanks for the kind words everyone. Just needed to vent I guess. Not really much I can do about it. I could have typed a while essay on everything else I deal with from them and my family. I just am too exhausted and not gonna trauma dump ha ha. Reliving it by typing the worst of it isn’t going to help.
That's a terrible situation 🙁
You can’t control what your parents say but you can talk to your kids! I know they’re really young, so that’s difficult to communicate. 

I would tell your kids that their grandparents don’t understand who you are yet. That they love them and they love you but no one ever told them about trans people. That means that sometimes they want you to use the wrong words for who you are but that doesn’t change that you’re their mom and you get to say who you are, not your parents.

I used this analogy for my niece to try and explain why people misgender me - If someone told your kid they were an elephant, your kids still knows they’re a human! And it can be hard to be called an elephant when you know you aren’t one, but that doesn’t mean you become an elephant, you’re still you, a human. 

And maybe one day you can have a conversation with your parents and they’ll come round to it. They’re your kids, not theirs, and they should be supporting your parenting, even if they can’t support your transition.

I’m so in awe of you for raising those kids as a trans single parent going to school. I hear you that it’s hard but I have faith you’re doing a great job and those kids love you and will get raised right thanks to you.

It must feel so far off but one day you’ll finish school and have the money for your own family home with your kids and everything will have been worth it.

My mom did something similar to this with my kids. Right in front of me. I shut it down immediately. They have no right to force their views on your kids, twisting their minds against you. I told my mom if she wants to be a transphobic pos I can’t stop her, but abusing my kids like that I will cut your face off. Don’t think it’s been an issue since.
Depending on the age of yiur children, you should sit them down and have an age appropriate discussion about the topic. Tell them that what grandma and grandpa are saying makes you very unhappy, and, given they're old enough, maybe even explain the whole- trans situation (?) to them. 

Children are not born with hate in their hearts, they look to their family for guidence. The better you make them understand what's going on, the more likely they will grow up to be kind and tolerant individuals. And of course, cut contact with your parents as soon as you can. I am assuming you already talked to them about how their actions are actively hurting you, so if they won't understand, let them carry the consequences of their own actions.
I appreciate the thought at least, Ty 🥹
Seriously.  Is there a Headsart near by? That might be a good childcare solution.  Or employment related child care support from your state? A lot of colleges have day care. Just some ideas. I'm sorry you are going through this.
Thank you <3
Why did I actually consider this lol.
Thanks! <3
Thank u those are nice words to hear 🥹
Everyone’s experiences and feelings are valid dude. Saying ‘someone has it worst’ is some toxic shit and you should probably do some work on that in yourself.

The post is asking for support and if you don’t have anything supportive to say then you should probably just keep it to yourself or your therapist.

People who say hateful things to people are usually super miserable themselves and don’t have the coping mechanisms they need to deal with their own hardships. They take it out on other people because it’s the only thing they know how to do. I hope you get the support and love you need to be happier and healthier in this world.
Just because someone has it worse doesn't make her struggle any less real.
Well said lol.

Yeah I stand by everything I said dude. I’m not saying you need support because you’re trans, I’m saying you need help because you’re hateful whether you see it or not. Why would you comment otherwise? Do you think we’re ignorant to what happens to our trans siblings worldwide? We know and we mourn for our siblings but it doesn’t mean our feelings are invalid.

Also, you’re not even trans so this is absolutely not the place for you to speak. Cis people have voices everywhere. We don’t. This is our place to speak. You should go elsewhere to voice these opinions.
For sure those people have it worse and we should support them fighting for the right to live a safe life. But there is no need to call people names for venting their personal struggles"	xycpaa	trans	104	0.98	2022-10-07 22:53:24
Friend of 10 years misgenders me on purpose and gaslights me when confronted.	"Hi. So, recently, I started socially transitioning which has gone great! All of my family and friends have been supportive, with the exception of my one friend who I have known for around 10 years :(. We will call him Yarnld. So ever since I came out to Yarnld, he has treated me weird. Mind you, when I came out to him as bisexual a few years back, he was mostly supportive, just a little surprised, but nonetheless, didn't care. So, when I came out to him as MTF a few months ago, I thought nothing would change. Instantly, he started calling me ""ma'am,"" even in front of my family who I wasn't out to yet. However, Yarnld didn't out me. But as time progressed, he continued to treat me slightly weird. He continued to call me ma'am in a snide tone but yet he would still refer to me with he/him pronouns, even after I was out to my whole family and even his family. Over the summer, we did a few summer camps, driver's ed, etc. and he would randomly say to people at those places, ""he's a woman,"" when referring to me, but yet would use he/him pronouns (he even did this later to my very young little sister after I was out, further adding to her confusion). I tried correcting him once and he said, ""she, he, he, she whatever. You are a male anyways."" That was when I was really starting to be affected by his negative attitude. He still misgendered me, and when corrected, he would say ok and continue to misgender. One time, he was telling me about how he told his sister that I was trans. He said she didn't think I would ""be like that."" I know his sister didn't say that because his sister is awesome and progressive/woke. He most likely twisted her words and lied. After that he proceeded to tell me that there are only two genders. The thing that made me really mad and confused was that one time his mom misgendered me (on accident) but then pulled me aside after and apologized but then she told me how one time, Yarnld corrected her when she misgendered me at home in a conversation (again, on accident). Was he just torturing me for fun? I wasn't sure. 

This kept up until finally, the other day I confronted him through text and asked him to please use my preferred pronouns. He said he always does, which was not at all true, and when I said that he doesn't, he sent an empty message bubble and question mark every time I replied. I told him to stop trolling and he continued to gaslight me. I brought up specific examples and he defensively said, ""why didn't you say this the last time we hung out."" While this seems endearing, I can tell he did that simply to deflect. He said that this transition has been hard on him because has had to change the way he has referred to someone for 10 years (me ofc). However, he has never even once tried to properly gender me, unless he is trying to make a quip or snide remark, such as saying ""ladies first"" slyly and in a rude tone. He left saying he was going to the beach. While this breaks my heart, I don't think I want to continue my friendship with Yarnld. He is mean to everybody. He talks shit about people behind their back, even my own dad and my brother. And he is also a very big liar. Yarnld has become a very different person from when I first met him, and I think we have grown apart way too much for me to consider him a friend anymore. '

TL;DR: My 'friend' keeps purposely misgendering me and when I confronted him, he denied everything and gaslit me."	"I mean, yeah that's not a friend. Cut them out of your life and move on to better people. Fuck em.
It's the best choice to leave and don't look back. People like this will talk about others behind their backs and do the same to you. This definitely isn't a good person and karma will come bite him quick. Just drop him, ghost him if you want. He doesn't deserve an explanation and you sure don't owe it to him. Do what's best for you.
sorry but Yarnld in general seems not like a person *anyone* would like to be around (""he is mean to everybody"", ""he is also a very big liar"", WTF)? second the other comments, drop'em and don't look back. you need supporting people, not aholes
You have more patience than me. I’d have slapped him by now.
My advice is not be in that position anymore if they Aren’t  going to at least respect your decision about you’re sexuality, gender,etc.
Dump him, be friends with his sister.
ur friend is a bad friend
Friends don’t have to stay friends just because you’ve known them for a long time
It sounds like he had something going on he's not taking about. That said your not a therapist is not your job to fix him. Let him know that you need some space, that your relationship doesn't feel healthy anymore. Make sure that he knows you'll be there if he needs to talk but unless he's willing to make some significant changes this is the end of your relationships.
I'm so sorry!

Gentle comforting hugs if wanted.

Hopefully your life will improve without that dude being so rude to you anymore.
True colors! Never Never trust someone like that again. We have all seen that! Be careful and Be happy.🌹
That’s gross. Not a friend. You deserve better.
I'm just going to say the same thing but the season of Yarid needs to end some people are only in your life for a season and that's for the best in this case.
thanks everyone for the support! i think that i will try to drop him, as you all agree and that's what a lot of my friends are saying as well. i will try to keep yall posted but as of now he hasn't replied or reached out to me :/
I’m so sorry that’s happening to you. I think it’s best to fit him off tbh he sounds like a horrible friend…
Confront him in person and if he gaslights you even once dump his as
That’s not a friend. Dump them
i love this
👆 This is important
yes please!
i remember one of my favorite tv shows (atypical) talked about this and i very much love and agree with this.
I've never seen it but I'm hoping you find all the advice given here useful.  I've lost friends in life for various reasons sometimes it was a bad reason other times people just go in different directions and drift apart with no bad blood between the two. I wish you the best."	xaerda	trans	104	0.97	2022-09-10 03:25:33
"""trans men are socialized as women"" ""trans men are better than cis men"""	"when cis women say things this, they are not only misgendering trans men, they are making disgusting implications about trans women. if all trans men are inherently good men, what does that make trans women? if all trans men are socialized as women, what were trans women socialized as? 

they clearly dont actually care about any of the individual trans men who have experienced misogyny, because they have this assumption that we all have, when many of us have not. they dont even care to ask us. in fact, almost all of them ive explained this to have argued with me against it. 

and the false pre conceived notion that all trans people are socialized as their AGAB is absolute bullshit. it absolutely goes to show that they just veiw us as our AGAB. majority of us knew we were trans when we were children. if you identify with boys as a child, you will listen to and internalize the lessons boys are taught, and vice versa with girls. even so, socialization continues into adulthood. the only reason their peanut sized brains cant comprehend something as obvious as this is because they are relentlessly transphobic.

they like to perpetuate these false generalizations about us, either because they fetishize us, or because they want to stroke our ego. or on the even more sinister side, theyre terfs. either way, when a cis woman says something like this to a trans man, she views him as a woman, and she does not like trans women."	"they erase trans men's experiences until they're a method to harm trans women. it's gross and backhanded and so so harmful.
Cis people talking about us like this is disgusting

Do they forget that In the west/global north, we are all socialized in a patriarchal, racist, and capitalist system; We all need to shed that socialization, regardless of gender. 🤷‍♀️
Well said - I ve been trying to explain this to people from the transfem perspective for a while now. it's interesting to see it from the guys' POV.
I like the expression ""relentlessly transphobic"" \^\^
hmm, i have a tough time with this. together both of those are incredibly toxic, the second one by itself is several layers of disgusting. But there is a nugget of truth to the first.

just look around on here and see how many posts there are of people looking for help to fit in with mannerisms and what not. Especially for older people just starting out there's alot of social conditioning and perceptions society attributes to one's AGAB that trans have to work through. A lot of it i personally think is needlessly gendered. 

its even worse if you're brought up in a conservate environment where you have to emulate your AGAB. Yeah, the social indoctrination feels wrong, yeah you notice the opposite and admire it, but there's a disconnect between what you have to do to keep up appearances and it leaves you where you know what you want, but you don't know how to do it naturally.

this is something i have a lot of trouble with personally. I'm will never be overtly ""girly"" nor do i have any inclination to be so. And Femme and ""girly"" aren't exactly the same thing. but undoing the years of habits i picked up trying to ""fit in with the boys"" isn't exactly easy either.

End of the day, yes, its a gross generalization of trans. yes it is being used in a way to hurt the perception of trans in general, specifically trans women (IE, trans women are socialized as men, therefore worse than cis women, because trans men are socialized as women so are better than cis men. God do they even see how man hating this is? never mind ignoring a trans person's identity for their AGAB)

yes it is also an issue some trans people have to deal with because some things in society are fucked when it comes to sex/gender and how its perceived. 

Don't get me started on this kind of talk when it comes to sexuality. I'm bi, but most girls think i'm gay, while most guys think i'm straight. dating is hell. :/ (i'm not publicly out as trans yet, though that will change soon, just started HRT)
this. 

as a transwoman it's always struck me as particularly gross how they go out of their way to erase and invalidate you all.
Ok so I do see what you’re saying. How we were raised shouldn’t invalidate our identity. It doesn’t make someone good or bad either. Over generalizations are not healthy.

However. There is something to be said about the experiences people have experienced in their pasts and how that impacts their perception and interaction with the world. 

I’m a white trans man and started transitioning in my 30s. I have trans female friends of the same demographic who transitioned around the same time. To answer your question, trans women were socialized as men in most cases.  I was socialized as a woman. There is an impact. I have had to correct these friends for making insensitive statements about cis women.  They’ve made statements like “oh that’s learned helplessness.” ….no, it’s because women spend a life time being treated differently and their best efforts are still not good enough. On my end, in meetings and conversations I continuously make space for less dominant speakers (the majority are cis women) while cis men, more often than not, bulldoze through. I have had women thank me for this. I have also discussed the need for all men to do this. In this sense, I don’t believe I am good, but I am certainly doing better than the cis men in that moment and working towards educating them. In my eyes, I do bridge a gap and I am proud of that. 

Stepping outside of a gender conversation, while each of us can learn to be sensitive to what others go through, there is a limit in how much we can understand if we haven’t walked in those shoes. I will never see things from the perspective of a cis white male. I wasn’t raised like that. And not all trans women were raised as men. Regardless of being trans or not, everyone has a story, trauma, and unique experiences that we bring to the table.
I was more under the assumption that trans men are less likely to be misogynistic, because they've likely experienced some pre-transition. Would this not be the case??
Those kinds of statements absolutely just reduce us to our AGAB and honestly are a lighter form of transphobia. To make blanket statements about “trans(gender) is this, trans(gender) is that” show the general lack of care and understanding of us as people. We all have our individual experiences growing up and socializing. I’ve met some absolutely terrible misogynist/misandrist trans people. Some people are just shit regardless of how they’ve been socialized. 

To say “trans men are better for xyz feminist topic” is just sexist and transphobic. Being raised female doesn’t make anyone any better at supporting women’s issues. Just look at conservative women. They’re misogynist AF. 

It just feels like we’re being lumped in with women still because we may have XX chromosomes. I’ll fight in the streets all day for women’s and reproductive rights, but to just assume I am superior to a cis man because I was born female is transphobic as fuck.
yeah i rlly hope ppl stop thinking like this. it must be especially hard to listen to as a trans fem.
As someone in their thirties still presenting as male and having grown up in a conservative environment, I can attest to that disconnect of acting one way and bottling other things.  Guys pretty much just avoided doing anything femme lest they'd get called gay. It takes a minute to break some of those apprehensions for sure, even if one leaves for a more open-minded place. 

In any case, everyone's experiences are different. Some people might change dramatically, some people might stay largely the same. Either way the point is the just be yourself.

And yes, dating will always suck lol
again everyone's experience is diffrent, but many MANY trans ppl are socialized as the gender they identify with. yes there are exceptions. but i can attest personally that when i was younger i genuinely didn't believe misogyny was a problem in modern day because i did not experience it. i, along with many other trans men did not have the female experience. and when i was a little boy, i knew i was a *boy* i was absolutely socialized as male. cis women trying to push this narrative that all trans men understand women goes to show that they don't know anything about us. and they dont want to, their goal by saying that is to harm trans people. 

thats my point. im not talking about mannerisms, im talking about thought process and behavior towards other people. cis people generally aren't overtly feminine or masculine either. their mannerisms vary widely. theyre not like caricatures or something.
[removed]
depends on the person but a lot of trans men dont experience misogyny, no. if they have been socialized as male (so the majority of us) we need to unlearn patriarchal beliefs and be held accountable the same way cis men are. the only reason cis women ignore this is because they are transphobic. and again remember the implications you're making about trans women when you use this logic. its deeply harmful towards them and untrue as well
Any more or less than a AMAB who has the feelings of a woman and sees what woman go through and hates the inequity of  it?
Yeah. It certainly is. I remember a few times as a young child when people tried to force male socialisation on me, and it's just a list of genuinely traumatic experiences. The one I remember is that a schoolteacher told me not to cry when I was six years old, and I actually got into trouble for crying.

Fast forward to adulthood, and hearing this kind of shit from transphobes? It's revolting and makes me relive bad shit but ig that's their intent.
“They don’t know anything about us”

As a trans man, i had a totally different experience in life than you. I feel excluded from “us” in your statement. Just think about that.

And the fact that you were unaware of misogyny as a male actually supports that people raised male who transition to female probably don’t get it either :(.
You sound like you think everyone has privileges
How are the majority of trans men socialized as men? Are you under age 23? Most of us couldn’t transition until later. Your comments are all coming from a very narrow perspective
This did psychological damage to me. I hated the fact I cried, not because I hated the actual release but the way it made other people see me, then puberty hit and testosterone took away my ability to cry… and it was replaced with a constant feeling of emptiness which led to years of depression.
did you read everything i said? in my original post and most of my comments i recognized that we all have a different experience. my point is, cis women dont actually care about your experience. they just view you as a woman and that is their justification for what they say and think. reread my posts. 

i am a trans male. i was not ""raised male"" i did not recognize misogyny simply because i did not experience it. and i was socialized as male because i identified with males as a child. just as most trans people are socialized with the gender the identity with. reread my posts.
doesn't rlly matter when you have access to health care it matters when you know who you are. most trans people realize theyre trans when theyre young. not all, but many.
And none of that is true for everyone. You should go visit my family. Be raised by them. Be abused and unloved and left in the cold. 

Most trans kids are socialized as the gender they identify with.

You are privileged and ignorant.
“Did you read?”

Spoken like a man.
Wow. 

So i knew when i was 4 but my life has been extremely difficult. It wasn’t an option.

And it does matter if you have access to health care, safety, support, etc.

You are making me feel like dog shit.
my family are POS too. you wouldn't believe the type of transphobia i experienced, yet i still learned and internalized male expectations and thought processes, because i have viewed myself as male for as long as i can remember.

I’m so happy!!	"Every stranger I meet mistakes me for a guy and it makes me so happy. They refer to me a sir or dude and it makes me so happy. I always smile so hard when someone says that stuff to me. I haven’t taken any T yet, but I have a naturally low voice and a small chest that I can wear a hoodie without a binder and I look like I have a flat chest. I go into mens washrooms and no one looks at me funny. All I have to deal with now is my parents misgendering me even though they know and I correct them, but it’s whatever.

I'm pretty sure my best friend is transphobic - UPDATE - He is :( (tw: transphobia, obviously)	"This is an update to [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/t1dxpb/im_pretty_sure_my_best_friend_is_transphobic/) post.

Today, I found out, that sadly, he is actually transphobic. I have a group chat with him and some of my other friends, and he posted a transphobic meme (next part has a spoiler on it as it says the transphobic meme) >!saying ""bro s-stop... I'm a boy"" then the next panel says ""I don't care, looks female enough."" !<. This really upset me, as a closeted trans girl. I didn't respond to the meme. I hope by the time I come out as trans (most likely in a few years), I won't be talking to him anymore or he'll no longer be transphobic. I really hope this is just him being an ignorant 13 year old.

Does this mean the rest of the group chat is transphobic? No. One of my friends seems to be fine with trans people and my cousin (who is in this group chat) corrected me when I accidentally misgendered my brother. The other 2 people in the group chat I'm not sure about."	"That’s awful, you guys are pretty young (which isn’t an excuse of course), but it’s possible a lot of hate is being fed to him by parents or other peers. I hope he gets better and becomes more open-minded because I can’t imagine how hard this is for you. You should bring something up with him, maybe ask about how he feels about the LGBTQ+ and from there, see if you’d feel comfortable ever telling him about your identity in the near future
I mean he's only 13. Personally I used to be transphobic myself as a kid. And it was all because of the way I was raised. But I was able to unlearn that at an early age, and he can too.

My suggestion (which you don't have to take) is to just talk to him about it. Say something like, ""hey I don't think this meme you posted was very funny, and it seems a bit transphobic. Are you transphobic or was it one of those things that you just didn't realize is hurtful to others?""

Or, rather, maybe I'm misreading it and he already told you that he's transphobic. In that case, you have two options that I suggest:
1- just leave him as a friend, altogether. He's not worth it
2- ask him something like ""what would you do if someone close to you came out as trans?"" And depending on his answer, you might just have to go back to option one and leave him completely.
You almost certainly won't have the same friends in a few years, it's part of growing up so try not to sweat it. It's also very possible that he may chill out, some people do grow into better versions of themselves. 

Sometimes they just grow older without growing any emotionally though so it's a crap shoot. Anyways sorry you had to deal with that.

If you think it's important to keep this friend you could attempt to get him to thoroughly explain to you why he says the transphobic things he does, and then remind him that he's being unkind when he says those things and if he tries to justify it ask him where he came up with that in order to get him to look at his own reasoning.

You would probably be able to reach him that way.

For example when he says something like ""Hey that person is transgender, his real name is blah"" ask him why he think's it's important to point that out. Then he hits you with the whole ""he was born blah and he's a boy"" and you can say ""she doesn't want to go by blah, why would you continue calling her blah if she wants to leave that name behind? That's kind of immature of you to do that to someone""

Like calling them out but in a kind productive conversational way. It's bound to go poorly but if I realized I was trans when I was in middle/high school I would have rolled with a completely different friend group lol.
I’m really sorry. In middle school when I came out to my ex best friend (from elementary school) she was homophobic so I get what you are going through. I would maybe try to talk to him and say something about trans people, maybe educate him?
Putting aside the transphobia there's also so sexual assault/ignoring consent stuff happening in that meme. He probably needs a talking to on what it's okay to joke about.
Damn, he's a literal kid. Honestly, just distance yourself from him. He might end up changing his mind later on. 

When I was 13, I wasn't really transphobic, but I was definitely an anti-feminist socialism hater.

Now I'm a feminist commie and a satanist so.
holy shit another transphobic comment what is going on today

anyways i have [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMiLG0lvMk) which may change your mind
cant even spell the r slur right, go back to your math hw dumbfuck
Aww what a sad person to go on the trans subreddit purely to spread hate. 

I hope you get some kind of feeling in your heart from this and telling people to kill themselves like your only other comment
ah, i see you're transphobic

i have [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FoMiLG0lvMk) which may change your mind
Get a load of this miserable piece of shit. Fuck off phobe.

thank u/CreativeNameAlt for that idea
dude leave us alone

go back to your weird facebook groups and that transphobic website which i will not name
And telling people they should kill themselves doesn’t increase their suicide potential? Literally abusing them, going to their spaces to spread your hate with “your hormies” doesn’t increase their suicide potential? The fear of being abandoned by those close to them doesn’t increase their suicide potential. 

Maybe if you fucking scum would shut the fuck up and let trans people live in peace the world would be a better place.

I’m so tired of being misgendered..it’s almost like people are scared to use the correct terms. Like..I’m not going to be upset if you say “excuse me ma’am” but instead I keep getting “excuse me sir” Or “thanks man” I don’t know how to combat it without starting unnecessary stress		"Your nose is fine, nothing wrong with it. People are just rude. Simply and sternly correct people about your gender and if they do it again call them out. Stand up and tell these people you’re a woman and will be respected as such.
There's absolutely nothing wrong with your nose I don't know where this rude commenter even got that idea from. As to being addressed the wrong way, I feel this so much. Whenever I get the ""thanks man / dude / bro"" comments I've realized at this point that it's just a passive aggressive way for them to be transphobic. There's two things you can do, either call them out and stand your ground or ignore it, the latter usually makes them confused in my experience. Personally for me it depends on whether I have the energy to deal with that stress on a day. Needless to say if people are genuinely unsure and not trying to be transphobic they could just simply say ""thank you"" or ""excuse me"" without a gender label.
I don’t know. I think it’s a weird cultural thing (assuming you are in the U.S.) where Americans love to add sir or ma’am for everything. Sometimes neither is really needed. I can see how it might be gender affirming to hear the right address, but all I can offer is to try finding it funny how these people are mistaken, rather than internalizing it as you at fault. Because you’re not. You look like a woman.
Preach! I think it's insane how people can look at me and think ""this is a man"" and similarly can't fathom looking at you and thinking the same.

Also don't pay attention to the nose comment, it's just a troll/chaser.
[removed]
wonder why, you are pretty and passable, not surprised when it happens to me as not very passalbe...but fight for it and wish you the best of luck
For me, ""thanks man"" or ""hey dude"" are considered gender neutral. I'm a San Diego former resident. What I start to view as bad it the ""sir"" and ""Mr"" type. And if you know me, don't deadnamed me unless it's my mother around my phobic step father.
It can be dis-heartening, I hear that.
Are these people important to you? If so talk to them. If not, why stress yourself out over something that could be a misunderstanding?
Looking beautiful btw.
Misgender them back and if they have a dog try to misgender it too
I get that a lot too. Some are respectful but I get a a few sir and man though I present female . Only thing you can do is correct them , if they respect that after that then they didn’t mean no harm
. If you had a friend come out as trans I’m sure you would have slip with their pronouns cuz it’s just a habit so for other people they have the habit of saying male when  they don’t know you. But the stubborn ones are just transphobic. If it happens at work just be like I’ll get my manager so they can find You that sir or man you keep speaking of and he can help you
I totally understand that, do you get panic attacks? The only thing I can think of as far as people misgendering you is your neck being an indicator of gender. I don’t know the technical name for it but the Adam’s apple.   I hope that wasn’t rude of me to say. Also your nose has nothing to do with it. No one is going to look at anyone and say “that persons nose is masculine, they must be a man” so that comment about your nose was rude and not needed. Just saying.
Aw thank you! I do wish I could get ffs sooner than later but I can’t yet. 
It’s hard to stand up for myself, not because I am scared but because I get worked up when confronting people
I mean, it almost seems intentional whenever I hear it. Like they’re refusing to accept me in a passive way. I live near Seattle
Wrong! Deleted this comment you’re causing unnecessary insecurities. Her nose is perfect for her face. She’s beautiful.
It’s that bad?? 🥺 I want ffs so bad but I’m still waiting on my HRT year mark for surgeries 😭
Your nose is fine btw. Both cis and trans women have noses of all shapes and sizes.
Stuff like man and dude are used by people as gender neutral times. Two of my friends call everyone dude and man.. one is a girl and one is a guy, they've literally called old ladies man and dude.. I've seen it lmao. As for the other stuff. Just correct people. Just do it.
Ah yes Pacific Northwest passive aggression. You know it’s hard to gauge whether it’s intentional or not when something is a sore spot. If the people saying this aren’t of any consequence to your life, while it feels bad to hear the wrong address, remind yourself they are not important to you and their ideas about you do not define who you are. And sometimes people make honest mistakes too. One day you might feel comfortable enough to gently correct one of these people (assuming you’re in a safe situation) and then the onus is really on them to deal with their mistake, and not on you to conform to their ideas about who you are. Still, if you can, find it funny that you wear what you do and style your hair as you do, and so on, and they’re still getting it wrong.
Your nose is lovely OP. I’m actually a bit envious of it.

Do I pass? My mother keeps misgendering me on purpose and its making me spiral. (ftm pre-everything)		"There's no way you're not cis wtf

Also genuine question: how come you have facial hair if you're pre everything?
If I saw you on the street id think you would be a teen boy.
I was about to say sorry and advise you to shave then I say ftm. Yes you pass, holy shit i had to actually go.. that is a trsns person?
dude 100% you pass. you pass more than me and i’m almost two months on T
My guy you absolutely pass, you actually resemble one of my cis cousins quite a bit
u definitely pass :0
Wow.. Nothing but 100% guy/dude vibes.👍😁 Coming from an amab person of 46 years (egg slowly cracking leading to MtF) ..
Not gonna lie you look just like a normal guy to me
Yes! 150%! How do you have facial hair?!
1000/100 also fuck your mom
Bro hell yeah. Your mom sucks. I hope she gets better but if she doesn't, she doesn't deserve to have her amazing, handsome son in her life.
You pass
if i didn't know any better i'd say you were cis.
Hell yeah man!
You read as male. College-age thinks-his-beard-is-more-impressive-than-it-is male but definitely male
Your mom’s being cruel, you pass.
I would probably gender you male but I’d be under the impression you’re 12-14. If we’re in a context in which you’re obviously over that age, I might lean toward female.
How do you have facial hair if you’re pre hrt?
Haha thank you! 

So I have a health condition which affects my bodys hormone production. One of the main side effects is that I have more body hair than the average biological female and that its rather patchy and happens in male-typical areas. I'm actually really thankful for it, even though other parts of my illness make life difficult. Luckily, however, it is an illness that many private gender doctors are aware of and I will still be able to take hrt once I have my first appointment later this month!

Here's hoping my little goatee turns into a big, bad ass pirate beard by this time next year!
I mean from what I know it does but it’s just not as fast. Could be wrong
That's the best compliment ever, especially since I'm 26 this year. Thank you so much 💜
Oh man, thank you. I'm pretty lucky that I have quite a few masculine features this early on in my journey already. I am most definitely trans, I assure you :p
Oh man congrats on 2 months! I hope your journey has bene a good one so far :)
This is where we find out, random reddit stranger, that we were family this whole time :p
Haha but thank you! It's so nice to have such nice comments, you guys are all lovely 🥺
Thank you!
Ahhh thank you so much!
And good luck on your journey too my friend, I'll root for you!
Aw hell yeah
Aw yis!

I answered that in a comment above but it's due to a lifelong health condition :) silver linings, though, because I'm very proud of my little goatee so far!
lmao yeah she takes it incredibly personally when I correct her. She's insulted by my existence haha
Yall I'm gonna cry thank you so much. I grew up thinking that I deserved to die every day because I hated myself so much and nowadays I see myself as a dude who is just underdeveloped and full of potential. Comments like this heal my soul, thank you so much, kind stranger!
Hell yea
Thank you 💜💜
Fuck yeah that's what I'm going for :p

 once the hrt starts I hope my evolution into my 'does-that-guy-think - he-is-a-pirate-or-a-lumberjack-or-is-he-just-a-weird-hipster' phase of life starts fully :D
Answered it in am above comment :)

Vent	"I cant stand the fact i have to change myself for society. I cant be seen as male when i have medium length hair even though i like it. And when I cut my hair short i don’t like it. I cant fucking win. Sometimes i’ll go on about my day and someone misgenders me then boom day fucking ruined. 

I was friends with this person since year 8 and we used to voice chat and talk a bunch but it’s year 9 now. I didn’t expect this but deliberately misgenders me and birth names me online. He clearly doesn’t care a fuck until his ass got caught doing it.  My form tutor helped me through a lot and i’m so thankful for it. He’s always there for me when nobody else is. It’s like one day i feel fine speaking to him then i get home and feel like shit. I don’t want to wake up with this burden anymore"	"This probably won’t be easy to hear. You don’t have to change yourself for society. You can be exactly who you want to be. But society probably isn’t going to change for you. You’ll have to make trade offs and compromises and figure out what you are willing to put up with. The sooner you accept that reality the sooner you can start building a happy life.

been getting misgendered a lot more recently [ftm] any advice on why or how i could fix it?	hi! :-) i’m milo, im new to this subreddit but i’ve been out for three years. as of recent it feels like i’ve been getting misgendered more in public than usual and i’ve been feeling a lot more dysphoric anyway. any (changable) features anyone wants to give?	"People are gonna say haircut, but boys don't need short hair to be boys. I can tell you right now, every boy with long hair gets mistaken for a girl or picked on for being ""girly"" at some point. My son didn't cut his hair for the first 5 years of his life and got misgendered so much. So, it's not a problem with you, it's a problem other people have with gender stereotypes.
I'm bad at gender. Haircut maybe? Idk. I see a guy.
Omg, as I was looking at your pictures, your style made me think of the song ""skater boy"", and then I saw the last picture of you with the skateboard. But honestly, you look like a dude in these pictures
Tbh hair is probably the most conventional thing here? You could try shaving the sides to get a faux hawk look, I did that when I was younger :)
you are so hot
appearance wise you just look a a skater boy lol, maybe voice? i don’t really know tho could just be transphobes trying to make a point.
I think your style is goals honestly. I see a dude.
For the first few pictures you looked like a guy despite the long hair, but the last one felt a bit off. Sorry that I couldn’t explain what exactly went wrong compared to the first few pics
Id say dont wear a hat? The haircut is 8/10, but wearing a hat with it looks more feminine, while without looks more masculine, so thats what I would identify as a cause.
Pronoun pins
Ur hot teehee
Haircut. Why? Because society has weird ass expectations that men need to have a short haircut. Every time a man has long hair (cis or not), he's prone to get misgendered, it's fucking crazy, honestly. 
Trust me on this, so, 3 months ago I had my hair not even too long, just like covering my ears a bit, I could still comb it back and make it look manly, but I kept getting misgendered at least a few times a month. Then, I got a haircut and did my usual very shaved haircut, and now everyone gets my gender right 24/7. It's crazy.
I think a haircut might help, not necessarily shorter plenty of guys have long hair but maybe shaving the sides? When my hair was longer I found that a side shave helped me look more masc without having to get rid of the length.
1/2 I would say goes either way 

3/4 andro leaning towards masucline/boyish 

5/6 andro leaning towards feminine, maybe it’s the piercing? Maybe it’s the hair? I’d say the last one is the pose, only since I’ve seen my exes younger sister doing the same or very similar thing. And 5 I’m really not sure, maybe a mix of the hair and lips 

Really hope I helped! Either way I’d say you’re on the right track to being the best you, keep it up 💜
Sunglasses and a skateboarding helmet that you will always wear, see those fuckers try to 1-0 that shit
Maybe try some masculinising makeup?
I am going to answer like the old man I am. Hair cut. You have a double chance of male pattern baldness so definitely enjoy your hair but consider a more traditionally masculine style. Septum piercing. Almost everyone with that exact piercing gets clocked as female. Even big burly men with beards will still get called ma’am with one of those. Those are my only two recommendations I like your style of dress. Nice bro vibe.
look at anyone who misgenders you and get confused about why they called you a girl
I don't see how people could be misgendering you. You defo look like a boy
U are absolutely transition goals. Bruh u so manly I feel feminine :( (u hot too fr and that’s coming from a straight guy)
Um milo i may be useless in this as you look like you pass very well
I don't know what those people see or think but I think you pass super well!!
This isn’t the be all end all, but if you’re up to it, get a mullet! It’s a very guy-ish cut especially right now
No clue why you’d get misgendered, only thing may be your voice but that’s pretty much everyone pre t or only a few months on t? Also if somebody tells you to cut your hair don’t listen to them, i absolutely love your hair and have slightly longer hair too as an ftm :)
Brush your hair...part it...or cut different
Blurry photo can't understand face
Hot!
It’s not you. Not your hair or your clothes or anything about you at all. It’s society. People make mistakes. Once in a blue moon I get misgendered.  It has happened even with facial hair and nearly 7 years on T. 

My biggest advice is to work on your correction. I used to let it happen and not address it. I felt horrible every time. Then I learned that my response could turn the table.  I give them a genuinely confused look, they recognize what happened, and typically correct themselves.
thank you so much :-) i usually get haircuts every couple months from my aunt, i jist haven’t seen her as of recent. thank you though! gender norms are really stupid.
oh lmao, im really glad, that’s a good way to be perceived, thank you so much :-))
i was thinking that too, i think next time i see my aunt (my hairdresser) i’m gonna ask her to dye my hair back to natural and cut the sides shorter lol
tysmm :-))
it might just be living in a small midwestern town of 200 where everybody’s extremely conservative :-///
thank you sm, as of recent since earning some money i also quite enjoy my style lol
i get that, that’s what i thought too :-/ could be the pose or something idk
hm, yea i see that now. thanks :-)
tysm :-)
yea, i thibk i definitely need another haircut. people are wack man
aw tysmm
tysm!! :-)))
Gender norms are a lie and the cause for some types of Dysphoria they shouldn't exist at all then no one would actually care if you where trans or cis because we would all be the same just with styles of clothes that we personally like
you are my type of boy, frfr
ya honestly probably, sorry to hear you have to deal with that.
In a town that size, pre-existing ideas about your gender are going to matter more than first impressions.  It’s an ""everybody knows you"" kind of scenario.  I mean, I see a young man with a laid back vibe but conservatives do fixate on stereotypes regarding hair (and hair has already been mentioned a lot).
At that point, it's not about how you look at all. I'm going to guess they know your agab. That isn't you being mistaken for a girl. That's bigots on a mission to correct you. Fk that, and fk them. Don't let them get in your head, baby boy. You look like a skater dude in high school, and *they can see that*. It upsets them that someone they think is or ""should be"" a girl is passing in a way that breaks their brains.

I'm a 40yo enby who also grew up in a small town. I left, transitioned, and went back for a visit. When no one recognized me at first, I just introduced myself with my new name, and I experienced no direct bigotry to my face. (There's no accounting for the bs small town folks will say behind a body's back. LoL) I finally got recognized at the bar, it was all up hill from there; it was suddenly dead-naming and misgendering all over the place, even from the people who had just earlier that day proven to me that they don't actually see the old person anymore. Some of them were trying to use the misgendering and dead-naming as a conversation starter to try and convert me back as a form of misguided caring. Some of them did it like they were on a mission. Most of them just did it because they were new to transitioned me, remembered the old mask, and responded out of habit.

Don't let them discourage you into thinking the work you've done is meaningless. It's not. You shine that radiant light of transition in their faces. You ""pass"" quite well. Someday, you'll get to leave that place and be around people who didn't know you before, and the new people won't know any better if you don't tell them. I promise.

[*hugs*]
They definitely are, I'm sorry you had to deal with all this dysphoria just because people think a haircut dictates someone's gender.
aw damn tysm, boosting my confidence too much
aw thank you so so much :-( i’m sorry you had to go through that. bigotry is such a big and annoying problem here, but thank you so much :-) the second i can i’m moving far farrrr away from this town, my family, and starting my transition. tysm !"	xvlhx1	trans	96	0.98	2022-10-04 17:42:19
"Is ""passing"" supposed to mean that no-one can tell I'm trans? If so, yuck, and I'm out."	"\(MTF\) So I've had this journey where dysphoria about this and that forced me into living ""full time"" before I really knew how to present female. So I had months of thinking I was living as Jenny and getting uniformly misgendered, because I wasn't doing it right. I wasn't convincing. To me, this period of my life is what ""not passing"" really means. 

Then I learnt new ways of presenting myself. \(I was taught. I'll be grateful until I die.\) Misgendering more or less stopped. Correct gendering started. That's not to say it was as frequent as it would be for a cis woman. 

I had a bad period \- I didn't know who I was. I wanted to feel female, my brain wouldn't let me. As a compromise, I identified as non\-binary. I let my appearance slip. My voice pitch went down. My make\-up skills, well let's not even go there. Right now, I still pass as non\-binary, I believe. My voice is ""Contrapoints minus 1"", if there's a scale. My height is 6'1.

The other day, on the train, somebody leant over to me, passed me their phone, and murmured ""That's me!"" with a cheeky grin. The photo on their phone showed them presenting femme; on the train, they were presenting masc. We shared a wink. If I gave them some confidence, by being visibly trans, then it's worth all of this.

Becacuse here's the thing: I'm attractive. My voice is androgynous. I have a female passport. People can see I'm biologically male, and in the UK, that often means people don't mean how to deal with me \(because this is a cretinous country\). But I present female, I look like a girl, I behave like a girl, I live like a girl, and since I started ""passing"" in this sense, and walking down the street looking like ""don't fuck with me"", I haven't had any confrontation, I haven't been called ""sir"".

I'm proud of being trans. Unfortunately, in the UK, being visibly trans means that some people will misgender me, due to ignorance. I have to live with this. I have to be proud. I'm not a manky dude in a dress. I'm young, attractive, fresh, and I believe I make a difference every time I walk down the street.

Not ""passing"", in this sense or that sense, doesn't mean you're gross, or a lost cause. It can mean being wonderful. It's taken me a lot of months to realise that xxx"	"> If I gave them some confidence, by being visibly trans, then it’s worth all of this.

Yes. This. I’m 2 months into living full time as Emma, know I don’t pass due to mannerisms and voice, and frankly don’t care. I get so much more positivity than negativity, and the most touching comments have come from other trans people, visible or otherwise.

I want to be closer to my minds vision of self, but if pass means not being a visible and proud trans woman, that’s not my goal.

Much love, sister. 💕
I used to waste a lot of brain space wondering what people ""really"" thought of me.  Later I realized that I was basically wishing for telepathy, and that if I had telepathy, that would be a nasty invasion of their privacy.  What matters is: am I happy with the way people are acting toward me?  The answer is yes.  So why should I second-guess that?
I want greatly to feel the same, but I'm still working on it. 
Here in the states (in the one I live in anyway) I feel severely unsafe when people see me not passing, and I'm so conflicted because YES, I personally want to look femme and adorable, but I also understand that there's this social fucking obligation to do so and fit the norm, and like if I don't, I could be brutally attacked. So I sometimes go through the internal questioning of wether or not I want to nail it, or if I've been conditioned to have to and knuckled under. I admit, in a perfect world with no stigma in being the real me, I'd get my shopping done in no makeup and let myself be more visible, because damnit, we're all so fucking beautiful for so many reasons and more of us should get the chance to show it.
Passing means people unconsciously gender you as you want them too.  It doesn’t mean stealth.  You can pass with a C-
You're really onto it \<3  


I feel exactly the same.
What's so yuck about passing? Nothin' wrong with wanting to live in stealth. I want to reach a point where people will just look at me and think ""woman"" instead of ""is that a man or a woman""? That's my goal. I salute you for living a life as a visible trans woman, you're in the front-lines and that's something I'll never have the guts to do, but let's not shit on each other. We're all in this together. Right? 
Thank you for this.
Yeah that's the point. I want to ""pass"" so I don't have to worry about being harassed when I use the bathroom, not getting poor service when I go out to eat, not being denied employment, and not have to worry about being beaten for being trans. 

If the world wasn't so harsh I probably wouldn't care so much
You can still signal if you pass
""Passing"" often takes it's origins from the LGB portions of the community, in the sense that passing is synonymous with hiding. IE passing for straight.

For trans folks, passing is different. That definition of passing would be better applied to our assigned identities, rather than our chosen ones. When we are ourselves, we're no longer passing, we're presenting. We're not hiding amongst the cis, like hobbits amidst the cornfields.  


To hell with passing. Live for yourself, and let the world worry about their own problems and hangups.

That’s awesome insight and a good point. Also, much of what I really needed to hear as I fear all of the unknowns of maybe starting down the road to transition. 

Thank you. 
I have periods where I wonder if I really pass or if people are just being nice and ""humoring"" me. I think it might tie into having a dysphoric episode. As you point out, it doesn't really matter. But emotions aren't rational.
I like to use the ""duck"" analogy:

Does it look like a duck, sound like a duck, behave like a duck? Then by all rationalities it _is_ a duck... If you can't tell the difference, the difference doesn't matter.
I'm doing it in deep conservative Texas. It's not about where you are, it's about who you are.
Violence is a risk for everyone in public and often the attackers are looking for the weak... TRANS DOES NOT MEAN WEAK. 
I've seen this definition - contrapoints calls it ""passing A"". But here on reddit i've seen the term used to mean her ""passing C"", I.e. stealth. And unfortunately, in the uk, if people glance at you and see a tran, they stop seeing a girl. So ""visibly trans"" and ""instinctively female"" are pretty much mutually exclusive here. (Yeah, as I said, cretinous) x
> but let's not shit on each other

Huh? She didn't shit on anyone else for anything, just expressed that she feels added value in being visibly trans. Her conclusion is that for her, the mental fight for 'must pass perfectly' is not worth the cycles. I agree with her, but it by no means says it's the only way.
I had to re-read that last line a couple of times to make sure you weren't being a troll. The wording is a little awkward, but your message is accurate. 
Oic - so for example if you believed you were intelligent? X
i thought if it looks like a duck, sounds like a duck and behaves like a duck, it was carlton's prom date?
I'm glad that works for you. 
Still, the numbers don't lie. We are at higher risk in public. -_-
[Cruel, but good worse use.](https://youtu.be/uUae1VCQRjA)
Perhaps the cretinous behaviour is due to prevalence of drag culture?
thanks for clearing that up
Yeah does look a bit trolly and that's probably a bit too awkward, considering every time i try and help it tends to come across as horrible or whatever. Just gonna delete the comment and move on with my life. Wasn't meant to sound trolly.

Now we wait for downvotes on this comment too
He dated Björk? Was she even old enough to be his prom date in the early 90s? I still love the swan dress and can't wait till I'm that confident in myself to wear something as crazy as that
I didn't say that we weren't. I said that attackers are looking for weak targets and if we carry ourselves without fear we are less likely to be the victims of violence- that advice is valid regardless of being trans, that's the same advice that's given in any self defense class.

someone told me that once i get my full on surgery he’ll start calling me male pronouns	this person misgendered me and i corrected him and told him my preferred pronouns however he told me “i prefer the truth”, he also told me that it was confusing for me and i was confusing myself for using male pronouns bc i still have a female body like isn’t that how being transgender works??	"That person can go eat a shoe. Hopefully it's someone that you can easily remove from your life.
That person actually sucks ass. I hope you can get rid of them fairly easily. My brother said this to me when i first came out. Your identity doesn’t have to align with your body. I’m sorry someone said that to you
What an ignorant creep
He's just going to keep moving the goal posts for when it will be acceptable for him to use your correct pronouns.

Classic transphobic trash tactics.
Don't care about him all you have to care and worry about is yourself. He doesn't call you with you're preferred pronounce? Don't give a shit you know who you are. You don't need to be accepted by some random people.
It's an excuse they use in order to dismiss you. If it's not this, it's that. You don't dress according to your gender? I'll only do it then. You're not taking hormones? I'll only do it then. You haven't legally changed your name and gender marker? I'll do it then. You haven't had bottom surgery yet? I'll do it then. Once you meet their requirements for what you have to do for them to do something so simple, they'll just add more on. 

Besides, how tf would they know what your genitals look like? Or hell, what anyone's do? They gender people on the street all the time with nothing to go off of but just looks. Why doesn't everyone have to pass this guy's genital inspection?
That person is trash, and has no right trying to be a gatekeeper to how you identity.
I would use his preferred pronouns to tell him to go F himself.

Although that's probably the response he wants... Think it and ignore him.

If in a social situation it's great when others correct the person. Mention it to trusted friends.
The truth is that you go by male pronouns. I’m so appalled people behave like this. His preference does not fucking matter when it comes to *your* identity.
Yeah, they all say that till you’re on t for a while 🙄
Stop talking to him. Ignore it
Also, you may benefit from calling them just pronouns, not preferred pronouns. They're your pronouns, just like a cisgender person's pronouns are their pronouns, no talk of preferences necessary. This won't solve transphobia and it helps introduce the concept as intrinsic versus preference based.
tell him you did and call him gay if he asks to see what's in your pants
Not much to be said aside from “fuck that ignorant asshole.”
What a fucking jackass. Ask him if gendered terms are so based on “truth” and “biology” why boats are called she, or why 1/3+ of modern languages use gendered terms/pronouns for inanimate objects, or, if you want to be simpler with it, how he knows you don’t have a magnum shlong?
i never liked him anyways. he’s a creep also. but unfortunately i live in a small town and would always get away whenever i see him.
honestly yeah but either way his mindset would still be the same tbh
i would also call him a pervert lol"	xbar9e	trans	95	0.98	2022-09-11 06:01:47
When you get misgendered, do you get really sad first and cry and then boil internally with anger or the other way around?		"I dissociate usually
At this point if I get misgendered I just laugh at whoever did it because if you look at me and earnestly go 'ah yes, a woman' then you're clearly so invested in your transphobia that it's made you stupid.
It happened today at my therapy appointment. I start to kind of dissociate, get over it fast, then think about it for the next hour LOL
I kind of just go numb on the outside and wait until I’m alone to get pissed off. I don’t want to give people the satisfaction of knowing they rustled my jimmies.
I dissociate and try to get away from the situation. I get angry later. When the anger fades I'm sad about it.
I dissociate and then feel shameful and uncomfortable  for whatever reason lollllllll
for us it's either a ""huh, who're you referring to?"", an Ugh, or Furious Rage
Usually when I get angry I start crying too so all of the above all at once I guess
If it’s on purpose then I usually get really angry and then secretly cry afterwards. If it’s an accident or they don’t know then I just try and pretend it didn’t happen, it used to really upset me and I’d try to leave or atleast stop the conversation but it’s happens alot so I’m used to it now
Little column A. Little column B. But generally just disassociate.
Anger first, sadness later.
Neither...
If it’s by family? I don’t really care anymore. 

Misgendered by strangers? That’s when I start sulking.
So, idk if this is just a problem with me or something, but I physically flinch when I get deadnamed or misgendered. Obviously I feel super sad, but I have a hard time feeling angry at strangers, or even people I know. Sometimes I will get mad at myself if I’m not feeling to well, but most of the time I just feel sad about it
I just move on because it happens everyday of my life so nothing else to do. I’m stuck in a lease and my family that lives with me, makes it feel like a prison. I’ll cry when someone actually gets it right and the correct name.
""Why did you call me that?"" \*NINJA STARE\*
Depends, depends on who's fronting. Depends on who's close to the front. If my trauma holder is close to the front there is going to be hell to be paid in full. She takes no shits from no one.

If it's one of the littles cry scream throw temper tantrum. 

But I always always, ends with me rapid switching, and having a killer migraine when it's finally finished.
I got misgendered when ordering fast food today. I tend to get a little angry and dissociate and then feel really sad about it after a few minutes
I just feel really gross until I’m alone and then either get really mad or cry
I'm an NB who only knows how to dress masc or fem so I get excited as fuck whenever someone use they/them anything else is business as usual
I feel absolutely nothing and don't even care at all. I just move on immediately.
It doesnt feel correct or normal for me
I just feel uncomfortable, if anyone misgenders me I feel like it’s only out of spite, I don’t pass much but I try hard to dress femininely and look it so it’d be hard to get it wrong, it doesn’t happen much but when it does it sucks. Feel really bad about it for a while after though.
Depends. Most of the time I dissociate and then don’t remember why/understand why I’m feeling upset hours or days later.
I used to get sad. Now i get angry. At this point anyone that misgenders me is doing it on purpose >:(
Eh, they don't get a vote, I am me. It's bothersome, but that's it.
I cry. My depression gets worse until I do an EMDR session. Then I start to feel better after a day or two. 

I mean, it sucks for my dysphoria but it’s also that I know that they’re going to do the same thing to any trans people they knowingly encounter and knowing the mindset that underlies it.
I just shudder for half a second and the rage goes away. I literally shake it off like a dog
I don’t care. Especially if the person did it by accident (this has never happened though). I don’t care because I know myself better than anyone else could. And anyone calling me “she” is legitimately only trying to get a reaction out of me. And they won’t get it. Because I simply don’t care. Sometimes I find it funny, because it feels ridiculously wrong to me if someone thinks I’m a girl.
So in short, I don’t care and when it happens it feels like a joke
i tell people i’m a cis woman with a hormone deficiency
Not misgendered but I remember my parents suggested I watched “what is a woman” and I had those emotions
I tend to just ignore it, I know I don’t pass well at all so I just push past it.
Somewhere between ""What young man you mean?""  and ""B* what"" or on special occasions ""Look at my other eyes and call me a young man again"". All completely depending on hot the hormones hit that day.

The outside reaction usually results in me raising my eyebrows in disnelief and taking a deep breath before answering anyways in my most feminine voice possible.
i get annoyed
Sadness, the only person I generally get angry at is myself. The exception is politics will make me angry, but I think wanting to exist in peace is a pretty low bar.
I say, I don’t know them, so I don’t give a damn what their opinions are
I literally prepare for an incoming wave of bad vibes.

I usually then return to my normal mantras.

If you miss gender me once I may let it slide, if it's multiple times I will correct you.

It all depends how good I'm feeling that day and how affirmed I feel that moment.

Lately I've just been like 
""lol this person. Doesn't know I'm close to getting 1 'ma'am' for every 'sir'."" Wtf ever...other times if you call me sir more than once in an interaction I'll correct you and feel pretty euphoric later.

However telling myself that 'it doesn't bother me' is a sure fire ticket to depression and anxiety land. I mean I'm probably going that way anyway but it's nicer to head that way with myself intact.
I haven't even started HRT yet and look (and especially sound!) more masculine than feminine, so it's understandable when strangers misgender me. I still get a little sad.

To end on a positive note, last week was the first time a stranger gendered me correctly, despite me introducing myself by male pronouns for legal reasons. That was quite a suprise, but a welcome one.
So when I get misgendered I don’t take it personally unless it’s someone I know. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and I don’t exactly pass or act my gender 100% of the time. Especially on the phone. I sound like a guy because voice training is expensive lol. It’s when they don’t correct themselves that I get upset
I generally look at the person confused and prepare for the worst.

In conversations where people are privileged to my transness, it makes me feel either disheartened or disgruntled based on my mood.  


Tangent, but the last time I felt this way was when I had let my facial hair grow a bit to give my skin time to heal and clear up and I had to go and pick up food due to a mix up.  I went boy mode for the first time in a year and that made me super dysphoric, I was both pissed and ready to break down in tears... it felt soul crushing and disgusting. I went home and packed the few articles of masculine clothes I had in boxes.  

Interestingly, I got more people staring at me weird when I was in boy mode for that run than I do when I dress as myself... so that's an oddly affirming thing.
Feels like a wave of intense heat flaring acrossed my body starting from behind my ears for some reason. How my body lets me know I need to grab my tongue, and temper before they take off.
If it’s a stranger I just keep it moving. If it’s someone I know I correct them and keep it moving. It only really upsets me (usually anger and then sadness) if it was intentional or felt microaggressive.
Dissociate a bit, devalue the person Misgendering me in terms of their worth/meaning to that of the traumatized teenagers I used to work with (anything they have or will say or do is meaningless to me as a person, my engagement is an act to keep them stable/safe and I don’t have to think about them after we part)

Sometimes it makes me sad/lonely/isolated/irritated but I’ve been in this shit long enough that having a reaction more than described above is too much mental emotional energy

Space out, move on, they aren’t my friends
So many varieties of misgendering, so many responses. So many fools, only two disinterested hands to slap them all.

Seriously it does hurt, still. I’m not a quiet one on it. I will deadass stop a conversation between multiple people to address this if I think it’s intentional. I don’t suffer hate crimes silently. I also tend to speak up if it’s for a sib in the tribe. 

If it’s a friend or someone just being super dumb, I am usually gentler. 

I get upset at night, laying in bed. That’s when it hurts me. I’m older though. Been out years. 

I find that telling someone they are a walkin’ talkin’ hate crime usually gets their attention. You de ISR if you want to deliver that with a smile or stone faced
Depends of who is misgendering me, if it's someone who I'm actually out to then it just annoys me for a while, otherwise I just kinda go numb since I'm pretty used to it unfortunately
I personally do not, with either of these options. Lol. I just dissociate and (if i did before) tend to never talk to the person again
I ignore it and move on. Most of the time, its done by strangers or people who I’ll have very minimal contact with over my life. If the contact and interactions become more frequent, I’ll correct them. Most people gender me correctly though, so I have a certain luxery others don’t.
Idk how else to describe it other then bruh moment
At this point, I'm used to it so I don't react or feel anything, but once in a while it becomes too much and I start bawling out of frustration. 

I'm very fem presenting because of my curves but I don't like anything other than he/him even when I wear fem clothes.

But yea like usually I'll just bottle it up and not really mention it until it happens like 50 more times.
It depends because some people make honest mistakes and will see yout you are what you are
It depends on the situation. Here's the way I handled it the last two times:

In the self checkout section of Walmart, I accidentally rang up one item twice, so I needed assistance from the clerk managing the area, a 20 something woman. Usually Cis women that age are supportive, but this one, after I thanked her politely for her help, said ""You're welcome, SIR"" with a sneering mean girl grin. My response was to go home and write a google review for the store, detailing the story and advising caution for Trans shoppers there. The two times I've been back since, I get called Ma'am by the greeters, so I think management reads those reviews and responded, which is to their credit.

The second time I was filling out paperwork with a government bureaucrat. She was making an abstract point about how paperwork is processed when she dropped a ""he"" while talking about my application. She gave no sign of being deliberately cruel about it, so I corrected her, on the spot. She got genuinely embarrassed, and earnestly apologized, and I very explicitly and kindly forgave her,and we both went happily about our days.

Each instance carried with it some internal seething, but nothing which I could not shake of pretty quickly; I am getting much better at managing my emotions since I started transition more seriously (stopped boymoding). 

But whatever your emotional reaction may be, it's valid. That's just my response to being misgendered.
Rage.
I don't care because I see a guy when I look in the mirror so if doesn't bug me as often as it used to
I space out, cry, then convince myself not to hurt or kill myself
disassociate, internalise, try not to jump off a bridge at 1 in the morning
I'm kind of used to it. I use my deadname and he/him pronouns at work so I'm usually not super surprised when it happens outside of work, I usually only get angry when people make no effort to correct themselves and are doing it repeatedly. Especially if it's obvious that they know they messed up and STILL don't correct themselves
1. Act like they aren't talking about or to me, or act confused, ask ""wait who are you talking about?"" 2. Dissociate unless I can't like I'm working or something 3. Get sad and doubt how I look or pass 

I don't get mad unless it's done maliciously by my parents or someone that knows I'm trans and knows they shouldn't be misgendering me.
Internally always internally
I’m still so new to this that getting gendered correctly makes me do a euphoric little double take, while getting mis-gendered is kind of what I expect
i stopped caring two turns ago, i just assume they misgendered bc they are uninformed, prejudiced or malicious, whichever option is it is not about me, and is between them and their therapist.
If it's a direct family member misgendering me: I don't care. They do it all the time and it's not going to change.

If it's one of my cousins or aunt's/uncle's: If I'm not out to the person, I don't care. If I am, they're polite enough to correct themselves, so it turns out okay.

If it's one of my friends: They have never misgendered me (thankfully). But I think I would probably dissociate and then get really sad later.

And, if it's a stranger: I dissociate and get sad later. Not too sad, because I know I don't look my gender. Not mad because, how was this stranger supposed to know? Just, dissociate so I don't make them feel like they did something wrong, and then get sad later that I don't look my gender.
I mostly have a freeze response, then try to evaluate if it was a slip up (especially with non-native speakers, where that's totally understandable). The exception is with students, where it's often technically misgendering, but in a colloquial ""catch-all"" manner (the students in my area refer to their teachers as ""dude"" and ""bro"" when expressing disappointment with decisions). There I don't react beyond giving a quizzical look and saying, ""I'm neither a dude nor your bro.""
i have been trans for most of my life before i even knew what 'trans' meant, and always referred to myself as the gender i identify with. so when it happens most of the time i don't even realize people are referring to me, but when i do i'm just indifferent or i get angry/sad because i feel like they're talking to someone else instead of me.
I had someone try to be mean on a picture I posted. They kept saying the usual ""Youll never be a woman"" etc but then she said. ""Resorting to a wig"" inadvertently she just complimented my natural long blonde hair 😂🤣

Side note: I was pointing out the definition of a woman would include 11-13 AFAB kids as they have the ""biology of a woman"". She didn't want to acknowledge it and decided I was not allowed an opinion as I was ""not biologically experienced"" 🤷‍♀️ Guess I'm not allowed to worry about predators of children.
Im not passing at all so i dont mind too much
disassociate and spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about it :/ then move on
Urgh. I try to shrug it off but these days it’s harder. Mix of dissociation and anger followed by inescapable hopelessness. Really stupid how bad this shit still affects me. Also really stupid how much I get misgendered despite having visible tits under my shirt, that are pretty fucking easy to see but being a trans girl is already a tick against me, the fact that I’m sort of a butch on top of that is another big tick.
Don't be shy correct them
Usually I get sad then dissociate. If it happens multiple times with no one correcting the people misgendering me, then eventually I’ll boil over in anger. Because I dissociate and get quiet usually, my anger seems to come from nowhere and causes more problems than it solves. 

Source: spending winter break with my transphobic family. I eventually started yelling “He! Fuck you!” at them when they misgendered me. Needless to say, they didn’t take too kindly to that.
I’m numb to it. I’m so used to it all that there’s no reaction. It’s just a part of my life I can’t change.
I wince, bottle it up and feel sad later, I'm closeted, it's not their fault.
I just stop, I feel like time has stopped, ppl are still moving around me but I don't talk anymore, when I go to my room I start the process of breaking down
Haha usually it's my own fucking family so I'll just let myself feel the dysphoria and then listen to music or remove myself from the situation to cope.
No I boil in anger first than cry
I get angry and dissociate. 

This usually lasts for about 1 minute. 

And then I spend the rest of the day shit talking them in my head. 

Between this and becoming a full license cosmetologist

My roast game has gotten phenomenal.
joke's on them, i use all pronouns.
It's hard to put energy into that anymore tbh I think most trans folk hit a point where they just can't.

i used to feel very angry and stop talking to the person who misgendered me
I’m agender so I rarely get gendered correctly by people, it doesn’t really bother me at all anymore because they’re strangers and it’s not like their opinion of my gender identity invalidates who I am
I don’t do either cis women get misgendered all the time.  I just ignore it and move on
I don't really mind tbh, obviously I do prefer being called a she, but when its my family, I do understand why they would prefer calling me a he, idk I never really felt anything when being misgendered but thats just me 🤷🏻‍♀️
This, followed by boiling internally and *then* crying 😅
Yeah usually it's an internal sigh/disappointment and then often progresses to locking up mentally where I don't really engage with anything happening around me
Mines, a dull pain followed by this
100% I put my head down and walk away
I just correct them and move and and am sad for the remainder of the day 🙃
LOL yeah that’s exactly how I feel. I’m only 16 so I look young, causing me to be more androgynous, so I can understand why people could think I’m a girl. But the only times I’ve ever been misgendered is because they’re trying to make me mad. And it doesn’t make me mad, I just think it’s funny because of how wrong it feels
I prolly feel worse bc I had to see my transphobic family yesterday haha
Uncomfortable yes, shameful maybe
Furious internal rage, I know they were talking about me
Literally me😭
Same:( I just cry later
Same
I try not to get mad at other people, I more just get a tsunami of insecurity after
Aw I know what that’s like I’m so sorry:(
Lolollll
Basically same, if it’s a kid I let it slide but like an adult I try to correct them
Aw:(
Same girl! I’ve been transitioned for over a year and a half now, I know I pass (normally lol) it now makes me feel like people just want me to have an ugly day
Good one I’ll use that next time lol
If people are on purpose transphobic and misgender me I probably will just ignore them and then cry in my car on the way home and if they’re accidental I’ll get really insecure thinking I don’t pass and not wanting to go into public for the rest of the day. Crying too haha
Me too!🥲
Dang I’m sorry about that. We shouldn’t have to deal with our own family and transphobia but.. we do🙃
Yeh :/ and I never correct people so if I’m not close with them and they don’t know, they keep doing it T_T
Yeah, I get that too. I tend to just sit down and stare off into space feeling awful unless I have something to do or someone that I am talking too.
Thanks I appreciate it. I’m usually not good at associating with others, but this subreddit really is a place of encouragement, inspiration, and like minded individuals. I never knew how common some of the issues I have faced were until I joined.
This gets them on the back foot...stammering.. if they say something about my andro voice I point to my neck scar (tracheal shave). ""Someone cut my throat when I was asleep."" \*NINJA STARE\* :-P
Lol little bit different, I was talking about my body when I was saying fronting. I have a dissociative disorder called OSDD1B.
 
 Movies and media have stigmatized it but before 1996 they used to call it multiple personality disorder.
 
now they call it dissociative identity disorder, or DID for short. I have a sub division of that called other specified dissociative disorder, or OSDD for short.
 
 There's no serial killer hidden in the midst like movies and all that makes it seem. 

It's essentially like having an apartment filled with people, and whoever fronts is the representative of the household at that time.

So when I say a trauma holder I'm talking about a person in my system who constantly relives traumas that I've experienced So when they're triggered they run to the front as the representative and are willing to bite someone's head off normally causing more problems than helping... 

When I say littles, I mean people who are the age of 10 and younger who are my system who front and be the representative and they tend to react drastically differently than someone who is like and they're 20s or in their teens.
 
 I don't know I could go into a whole spiel of what this is but that's a different topic.
 
 The point that I was making was depending on who fronts has a different reaction, that doesn't mean that we instantly go into angry fit mode or crying, we do try to correct them multiple times and then after a while we get frustrated and then shit happens. I don't know if that makes sense?
I know 😔 wish it wouldn't happen to any of us
A good cry never hurt anyone. I don't pass either. I have gotten to the point where I am too uncomfortable boymoding to keep doing it, and my emotional control over things like being misgendered has improved enormously since I stopped.  I honestly try to focus my attention on the people who are not cruel to me, and do my best to ignore the ones who are. That doesn't mean I never wallow in dysphoria, telling  myself  I deserve to be misgendered; only that I get over it faster and more completely than I used to.

my parents say they accept but then why are they still fucking saying it	"(ftm)
(possible TW)
I came out to my dad as trans months ago. he's said he accepts me. he called me my preffered mane once in a conversation. in that same on he also called me his son and a boy. it made me so happy but he's just gone back. he calls me 't' instead of tom (it can work as a nickname for both my name and my deadname) but I can tell he sees it a a nickname for her. his daughter. he says 'you're such a smart girl.' not even trying to correct himself. not even hesitating. not even having a speck of it being the wrong thing to say. and she she she she she she her her her her her her AND I TOLD YOU DAD!!!!! YOU KNOW IM A BOY. YOU SAID YOU ACCEPTED ME.  

with my mum she mostly calls me t but sometimes tom. and she refers to me as they instead of he. she misgenders me alot less but it still hurts. it hurts so bad. I've never once heard her call me her son. she used to call me a boy when I was younger as a joke. bit not fucking any more. 

why can't they just fucking realise"	"It may take them some time to adjust. I know it's frustrating but give it time. Maybe do some gental reminders every now and then. I wish you all the luck!
Do you want a hug?
Are you me? I'm sorry bud. I'm too sad and brain-dead to do anything about it rn so i don't know either.
i feel ya man.i came out to my parents and they just make fun of me. its ""i see you as my daughter so thats what you are"" and it hurts. i get angry and they just call me sensitive. it sucks. just tell them you want to be called he, boy, tom, man, son, etc. and hope for the best. good luck to you.
Have you brought it up with them since? Trying to convey that you really would appreciate it if they could put in some more effort?  


I don't know what your relationship with your parents look like, but from what I can tell they don't seem outright angry about it, more so having a hard time bringing themselves to actually refer to you the correct way. The best thing to really do to make people understand one self is to tell them what you're thinking and feeling.  


I know it's a hard conversation to have, especially with them being so reluctant, but you're their son, they need to respect your wishes and desires as well!  


I hope you manage to resolve it as soon as possible and can make them realise that they are hurting you; Lot's of love :3
I've been out for about 10 years now, I've been on T, and I have a surgery date scheduled. Family still fucks it up sometimes, the only ones who reallytry are my mom and stepdad. I know it hurts but it's going to take a while to adjust. Keep in mind that they did not experience your gender journey with you, they didn't have the months or years of questioning yourself and finally coming to terms with yourself. It's still very new to them.

Your parents sound great, they'll get there. It's important too to start working on some grounding skills. I didn't realize it as a teenager, but I put so much weight into how people referred to me and what they thought of me. I got angry, I got depressed. It took me a long time to realize I was making myself miserable by placing so much of my self worth in other's hands. Being misgendered still stings, but it's not the slap in the face I used to think it was. You'll get there too, this is going to take time.
I’m in a similar situation :/ My dad just avoids me at all costs. When i walk down the hall he will hide in a room to avoid me. My mum uses my new name but won’t call me her daughter. She says “child” instead.
I'm sorry you're going through this, I came out to my mother years ago and it took her until a month ago to call me by my name. She still hasn't used the right pronouns yet to my face, I can't even imagine how my father would go if I told him especially after a conversation we had about non binary people in general.

I hope things get better for you and they accept you for who you are.
As someone who is on the edge of transitioning, and also a father, let me be very clear, your dad obviously loves you, and it's going to take himself some time to adjust, he's going to slip, it's going to happen, be patient with him please, and drop gentle reminders when you can. 

On a secondary note: this may be extremely difficult for him subconsciously, on a level he can't quite control. Please be patient
my parents are the same and it's been almost 5 years. hard to even have the energy to correct them anymore. they gender me correctly in public but will use my gender neutral middle name instead of the masc name i chose. only she/her and nickname for my deadname in private. it is truly ridiculous i hope to god they will be able to come around more than mine have
It took my wife one year to call me proper terms. It takes time what really matters is how they treat you. Don’t get mad but always correct. They will get it eventually.
Some parents take a while but I accept you as a he. And you can be my brother 👨 I’ll always care because being yourself is the most beautiful thing you can be <3
I had much the same situation. Chosen name had the same initial as my deadname and for the longest time my parents just called me E... I saw through it and knew they just meant my deadname. 

It definitely feels like they are transphobic, which is true they grew up in a transphobic society. But with time they will see you for yourself and get used to the name. For my parents it took about one year to start properly using my chosen name
Ugh I'm sorry. I relate to what you're dealing with with your mom. When I told mine I went by He and They pronouns... She legit told me ""I don't like the idea of thinking of you as a boy"" and told me she would ONLY use they/them. 😑
Idk if this helps or not but here's my experience:  


I came out to my parents at 14 and said I used they/them. A couple months later I realised I preferred he/him and told them that. I was only out to them and a couple friends so they only used my birthname and she/her for me at all times so my brothers + grandparents didn't know before I was ready. About 4 months after I initially came out they arranged for me to start seeing a doctor who knew a lot about trans stuff who was very cool. A year after I initially came out, I had settled on a name (after trying to get them to suggest some - they did but they were all gender neutral ones I didn't like), and we told my brothers. From that point my whole family were using my correct name and pronouns but my parents still messed up a whole lot more than my brothers (to this day I've only heard one of my brothers mess up once).   


It's almost 3 years since then and they still occasionally mess up.   
It's a big adjustment for parents, and I'd recommend correcting them every single time they mess up. That's not only name and pronouns, but stuff like ""you're such a smart girl"" too. I know you'll probably feel annoying doing it but it's the only way they'll change. I'd have a conversation about the ""t"" instead of tom thing too. Let them know it really hurts you when they don't call you Tom.   


Again, almost 3 years after coming out to them I've only heard my parents refer to me as their son a handful of times, and they still mess up pronouns. (Also my mum also went through a period of referring to me as ""they"" instead of he. I just told her I wanted her to only use he/him and corrected her when she didn't from that point onwards and she doesn't refer to me as they anymore)  


So yeah, idk if that helps. Just trying to share even with the best intentions sometimes parents make a lot of mistakes (often without realising) and need a lot of correcting and conversations to correct the stuff that hurts you. I felt the same way as you, just know it definitely gets better, and try to correct them whenever they mess up (as soon as they do) and have conversations about it to get them to understand
Big hug to you. I’m so sorry.
I do think it's important to remember that we have thought of ourselves the way we do for a long time before coming out. Once we are comfortable enough to come out we have already accepted the change. A lot of times with a lot of back and forth thoughts on it and self hate because of it. I did/do at least.. but others that have known us all our lives didn't have the same time to think and accept it. It can be extremely difficult to even admit we are trans and accept it. If we take a long time to accept ourselves, we can't expect others to accept it overnight. I believe in time things will be better. And there is a strong community here to help support you and us all in these situations
thank you
fucking yes please
yeah I just wish it was easy
Feel you both, my dad even makes dirty jokes about how I can't get laid as a woman that's why I'm trans ace.
I told my parents before that I was raped multiple times and even thinking about this stuff makes me sick and very uncomfortable, no-one cares.

Hope your and OPs parents adjust quickly 🥺💙
thank u for saying son <333
I'll try to thank you
yeah and if I was genderless I'd be happy about being referred to as my parents child but I'm not. in her son. and why can't they just put all that effort into calling me their son
yes I am now your brother thanks for the adoption
*gives hug*
I care. And I’m so sorry you experienced such awful trauma. I hope you heal and recover well.
Hehehe, just speaking the truth :D I'm happy you found some joy in it!
i really hope things get better for you. just wanted to let you know you’re not the only one going through this 🖤
No problem!! You’re perfect in every way!! Don’t believe anything less. Ever.

Do I pass at all? just genuinely curious! Won’t be offended so don’t worry abt misgendering :)		"You pass as a frickin SUPERMODEL!! If I saw you in public I would imagine you were a transmasc enby, but you're very androgynous so I would definitely ask you
You have that androgynous model energy - it can honestly go either way. (I mean this as a compliment! It's amazing)
You’d definitely pass with me. When I was a straight man (now I’m bi) I got misgendered. It makes me wonder about myself 🤔
I'm guessing you're trying to pass as female? Borderline at best in these pics.

Are you generally gendered correctly by strangers?
You look great but if i seen you somewhere in public I would honestly think ur male.
completely!
you look like a lesbian (in other words total pass B)<33more than i could right now)
i love your hair! ✨
You look awesome! Keep rockin' that look!
I read you as female
[deleted]
Man, thanks so much. So many sweet people on here. It’s amazing to experience people okay with this!
Thank you, that’s so kind! I’m definitely trying to go for male, but el hormones probably haven’t kicked in that well yet anyway. That’s sick though! I kinda like being on the line
Hahah you’re whatever you feel! I prefer to stick to a more binary look, think gay ass redneck, but honestly maybe it’s just because you slipped more comfortably into your skin when you identified with yourself more.
Hell yea! Definitely what I’m going for!
Hahahah I’m trying to go for male actually! But that would explain why people other than my preferred gender keep approaching me, lol. I bet you do pass :,) and if u don’t that doesn’t mean you aren’t a beauty
Lol! I’m ftm but hey, I can do both :)
Aw well thanks! I’m actually 20 so don’t feel too bad lol, I know I look 15! Glad I could make ya day a little brighter!
duigjf i'm so sorry, but i mean ypu got the look down packed honestly, and well i pass a bit, but thank you<3 and sorry for the confusion :,) seriously sorry-
also i really dig the shirt!

Dw about it! Idgaf about misgendering you can’t expect everyone to get it right all the time! Nah, you’re doing great lass. Keep it up! And thank you! I wish I knew where I got it
It did notify me!! Thank you for the compliment in there! Don’t feel like you offended anyone, well you definitely didn’t me! Always reach out for support :)
ah alright, and well yeah true, but thank you! i appreciate it!<3 and well the tag may have the brand but sometimes not even,
It says j galt, I do not know who that is lmao !
i searched it up and it said it's john galt, they have pretty cool clothes, also found the shirt you had but in black!
THERES A BLACK ONE? Oh man you may have gotten me hooked on this
YEAH YHERE IS! i typed in j galt and then put skeleton shirt and boom
I hate shopping but... boy is that enticing

Gendered correctly, IN THE AUTO PARTS STORE!!	I went in expecting to misgendered, like usual when I have to go in to the parts store. I was pleasantly surprised when, even though I had all my motorcycle gear on sans helmet, they got it right! My gear is all from the before times too, so not particularly fem either! I'm just really happy and had to share XD	"Oh my gosh girl! You must be on cloud nine,  I’m so happy for you
Ha that just happened to me yesterday too!
A worker in taco Bell remembered my chosen name and I smiled the entire drive home, it's the little things, and I'm also an automotive person, might be a bit more difficult to pass at meets, especially before starting HRT, but I gotta keep being a car girl since that's what I love ❤️
You're braver than me if you still go out to meets, I haven't worked the courage to go the the car meets around here since I came out
I'm actually waiting until I start presenting to go out to meets, I want to go out this summer, even if I don't pass well it's just for the summer because I'm moving soon anyway
My plan is to wait until I get my new, super fem,  motorcycle gear before I go back out"	byc1vq	trans	88	0.99	2019-06-08 20:13:49
Literally just got called sir in the shop behind me, first time being misgendered in months, I was so stunned I stumbled my words		"... How the everloving fuck does someone look at you and think ""I better use Sir""??

Seriously. That person needs their eyes and brain checked.
Well they’re blind. You’re very pretty and that hair is gorgeous
Why the F do people feel the need to assign gender? Pisses me off.
Sorry you had to go through that.
The world is full of A-Holes.
You are beautiful btw.
""Sir""?  Was that guy DRUNK?  BLIND?  ON DRUGS?

Or just plain STUPID?
Awe im sorry love
😮
What that person that misgendered you on some kind of stuff? Like extreme bigotry
Omg honey I'm so sorry, you pass so well I don't know how could they! :(((
This. This is painful, but working in retail, I've come across a way to deal with most of these people.

Something that you have to understand is that while there are blatantly prejudiced people out there, that most people simply don't know anything about the trans community. They're insanely ignorant, and they're just trying to be polite and formal.

If some says ""Sir, I need help with something."", my response is always ""I'm not a 'Sir', but I would be more than happy to help you with that""

*cue ""genuine looking"" retail smile*

This catches them off guard. They immediately apologise, either in genuine disbelief that they came across as impolite, or because they're worried about being viewed as such in public. From then on, most will refrain from calling you ""sir"" if they deal with you on a regular basis. I still have regular customers that refuse to change what they're saying, and new customers all the time that accidentally misgender me. It's something that is going to happen. There are hyperfeminine cis women that I work with that get misgendered too. People just open their mouths and don't think about what's going to come out beforehand.

I would recommend that you try my approach out. See how it works for you. Try it more than once. More than a few times. It's helped other trans people I know, and I believe it can help you too. Even if for no other reason that to make them feel just as awkward in the interaction as they made you feel. It will show then over time that they can't always rely on assumptions. The only way we improve our world and understanding is through education. Ignorance is such an odd thing, and can lead to aggression and misunderstanding, but it can also be wonderfully easy to cure with something as little as a sentence.

You're a beautiful woman. Words don't change that. Do your best to remind yourself of that in challenging times. Love yourself.

Should you try my approach, I'd be curious to know how it works out for you.
Oh honey, I'm so sorry to hear that. you are very beautiful.

P.S. I think I know where that photo was taken, I live round the corner if I'm not mistaken
I am actually 100% confused. I literally cannot see a single way how they could look at you and see a ""sir"". Like I'm not even trying to be kind or anything here, I genuinely do not know how they could see a ""sir"".
I just saw this, and wanted to check in and make sure youre ok?
Really, how could someone mistake you as a sir? They might need their eyes checked
Yeah I think cis people should use a bit of tact and if they are uncertain they should keep their mouth shut! I think because he could see my pink turtleneck and long hair it should have been enough to make him hesitate to use sir, but he also looked like one of those people who has absolutely no patience for trans people so... Well thank you for your encouragement and reinforcement anyway! Much appreciated ❤
It is strange and I try never to assume someone's gender, maybe the shop clerk has just been told to always use sir and miss but hopefully that will become outdated in the future. Thanks for your sympathy and understanding and for saying I am beautiful :)

It just reminds me of how much it used to sting all the time getting referred to with male addresses. Since things have been getting better I almost forgot how it felt, but also because it has been relatively long since the last time, it made it extremely significant and painful this time! Because then it just injects doubt into my brain when I thought I was doing well. Oh well I'm sure I'll be alright anyway I am strong!
That's why you should just call everyone fucker,
""Sup fuckers"" is completely neutral
Lol it's cool cos after that a very handsome guy called me love so I'm all better haha. Just shows I still have a way to go though. That just means there is more excitement to come!
Hiya thanks for checking on me, yeah I am ok. I forgot to update this thread because the day after, I went back there and he said 'Yes sir' again and I said 'Miss!', then I think he did address me as miss. It remains to be seen what happens next. I think it made me doubt myself a bit but I'm not too upset over it thankfully.
If this wasn't r/trans it would of thought you were cis. You look great! You pass really well, that guy really sucks.
[removed]
That's awesome well I hope he can talk to you cause you are very beautiful
literally what is your fucking purpose
It's literally not obvious in the face. Men are just nasty. I've watched men call CIS-women sir/trans before.

Go troll somewhere else you mean nasty evil person. Can a mod come by and ban this dude? All of its' activity is discriminatory.
I reckon I just look pretty rough in that pic because it was very early and I was still sleepy and wasn't wearing makeup and had a men's coat on. But tbf I know I could come across as just a girly man sometimes (but my hair is real), but luckily that is increasingly a rarity nowadays as I get gendered female enough that I can be confident in introducing myself as female and half the time people do not know I am trans (I know this because some people I knew only started suspecting months into me knowing them).

Still, it is probably unreasonable to expect to pass 100% because I am a) 6 foot tall and b) have not had facial surgery yet. It is fair enough if the cashier just honestly thought I was a male I guess, even though obviously that's not my goal.

I appreciate your honesty! 👊"	esvtzx	trans	85	0.97	2020-01-23 16:54:34
I hate having to come out	"I’ve been out as trans for about 5 years now and the dysphoria is shitty and getting misgendered is shittier and there are so many negative (and positive) aspects but I fucking hate coming out the most. 

I had to send my drama teacher a message today telling her I’m trans because she wanted me to do a duologue with my friend as a female character and I would be so so uncomfortable since my friend knows I’m trans. 

At this point I’ve come out enough times to not be scared of coming out to the right people but like the fact that I even have to come out and ask people to use the right name and pronouns makes me want to throw up. It’s times like this where I wish I could be cis. On top of that I have a lot of mental health issues too that I sometimes need to tell people about. I just really fucking hate that I can’t be “normal”. I hate the fact that I have to ask anyone to “accommodate my needs”. Sorry for the rant."	"Do you feel like a burden? Like being understood and treated accordingly is an imposition?

If so ive felt that too.
Its hard to accept comfort from others.
Like its foreign and so you cant trust it.
Literally the thing that's holding me back from coming out fully.. socially transitioning is hard but I know you'll get there. Stay strong, stay positive. You got this :>
There is no normal. We all have our imperfections,our ""weirdness"". But the fact everyone is unique is a Boone rather than a burden. Take it from me and many others on this sub that you aren't alone. It took me 3 years to come out to just my family. And I didn't like it either. So,my bottom line is, you *are* normal. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise,and don't talk to yourself like that.
Yeah exactly. Why should I be the odd one out? Whenever I ask people to use the correct name and pronouns it feels like I’m asking them to do the hardest thing ever
Thank you <3
Thank you, so much.
They dont understand being in a body and living a role that just doesnt suit them. and it makes it nearly impossible for them to “walk in our heels”.

But things are improving. We’ll be okay i think 💜
I hope so :)"	lmmolp	trans	88	0.98	2021-02-18 13:22:48
Misgendered by my therapist	"so I've been going to therapy for a few months now and last time I told my therapist that i'm trans and told her my pronouns are he/him, and she was really nice and said she supported me and I was really happy abt it. Today I went to see her again but the whole session she adressed me as a girl, using she/her pronouns when i clearly told her i go by he/him.

idk if she's doing this on purpose but i dont like it. i dont want to tell her again bc it was really difficult to do it last time bc i started litterally crying of how nervous i was, but i dont want her to keep misgendering me.

Edit: i really wasn't expecting all these comments. i wish i could do as most of you say but even if she was actually transphobic, i wouldn't be able of just finding a new one bc i'm 16 and not out to my parents yet. i really hope she just forgot, but im not really sure if that's it. i can't text her either bc my mom won't give me her phone number nor her email for no reason.

Edit 2: i just had an appoinment with her and told her abt my pronouns and everything and she was really nice and she mentioned some ways for me to come out to my parents and all. I feel like i overreacted now lol. At least i feel better now and know she just forgot :D"	"If you've been seeing her for a few months it may be habbit. I would bring it up again, and make it clear that you would feel more comfortable going by he/him pronouns. If she continues doing after you have told her for at least 3 visits, you may need to see a new therapist. But if you see her correcting herself, then she just needs time to adapt to the change.
I would explain it to her thoroughly. Make sure you are understood. If you are misgendered again, I would walk out the moment it happens and find a new therapist.
might be a stretch but if your therapists first language isn’t english id keep correcting her ! my therapist is from a different country and speaks english quite well but often accidentally misgenders people(even cis people) and had an issue with calling me she/her a lot simply because it was what she was used to and she struggled to keep things straight for a bit. 

obviously if this isnt the case id say something and try being assertive, if she continues id go to a new therapist if you can
If you have her email or cell number, you can remind her about your pronouns via message before your next appointment. Then see how she handles it. She might apologize and truly have had a huge brain fart the whole last appointment and this might set things right. I am a therapist and sometimes I totally forget something that came up last appointment and go into autopilot mode if it is a hectic week and my brain is taxed. Something like this, I certainly hope not! But still.
On the other hand she might be defensive or minimizing or not willing to make the effort to get it right, which would all be red flags to look for someone else. As another commenter said, she is literally getting paid to give you her full attention - as well as a safe space to support your journey. If she can't or won't get back on board with that, you deserve better!
If people misgender you, correct them. Nobody else will do it for you. That's really the long and short of it.
Make it clear that if she keeps doing this you will be firing her.  She can do better or be shown the door.
Sounds like it's time for a new therapist.

Good luck to you Dude!

Edit:grammar
You might try sending her an email in between sessions saying that since you came out you expect her to respect your identity and pronouns, remind her of what they are, and maybe include something like ‘I was disappointed that you did not do this at our last session and if this misgendering continues I may have to find an alternative therapist’ if you want to really make your point. Stay polite, but if it happens again after this warning you definitely need to switch to a new therapist I’m afraid.
Correct your therapist every time. If they say she/her just instantly but in with he. If they cant get the memo after that, then maybe its time to seek a different therapist and report this one to the health board.
Did you correct her?
Idk how this works but they might be testing if you're telling the truth or not 

Just keep telling them your pronouns until they eventually stop misgendering 

If it keeps happening for too long then get a new therapist
I found a therapist who is trans and has autism, like me. It’s saving so much emotional effort and finally I’m getting the therapy I actually need because I finally feel validation on these issues naturally, not as part of the work of therapy. 

There is something valuable in what others are suggesting to make sure, and having these conversations can be most helpful with a therapist. 

And, I suggest meeting with someone more like you, if possible,to see if it’s more beneficial overall.
Yeah time for a new therapist not cool, and shame on them!
People can forget, esp. if they have alot of clients. Thats what I hate most about it, pinning people on the wall and calling them the devil if it happens once/no effort was made to remind them
Yeah. I'd be looking for another therapist.
I would bring it up again. Your therapist probably has multiple clients and even though it is her job to pay attention to you specifically, slip ups can happen. My therapist who is treating me for adhd has adhd herself and often slips up about things we have or haven’t talked about, so we decided to sum up the last session before each session. Does that sound like something you could do too?
How are you presenting? I took my wife for a cortisone shot to the knee, in my female persona. I make absolutely no attempt to hide 1) I'm M2F   2) I'm with my wife, whom I dearly love. The doctors and caregivers engaged me in conversation and referred to me as they/them without me having to prompt anything. If you are still presenting female, and you are seeing a therapist for a different reason, they are probably concentrating on that issue. They probably see you for about 15mins every month, if at that. Tell them to put your preferred Pronouns on your file, and they won't make that mistake again. I don't know where you live, but it's incredibly hard to get a therapist, and once you leave, you may have to wait literally months to get another one. We had to wait close to 8months, and that was also assigned via a hospital, for a mental condition that she had for 28yrs. The last assignment expired as our family doctor took over dispensing the prescriptions.
There just words. Words only have meaning because that’s way you are perceiving it to mean  I don’t know what the issue is it’s force of habit most likely I don’t believe a doctor would be so cruel as too purposefully negate your request to be addressed by certain doctors whatever you just called that just keep correcting her or him or it I dunno all that stuff is confusing
Go trump we’re gonna build a wall and we’re gonna watch them go under over and around it heyyuuu
Tell her you feel uncomfortable and threaten to see a different therapist if she wont stop
 If talking about it is hard, I’d suggest you write this down and give the paper to her next time. Sometimes writing is way easier and can get the point across. 

I went through a similar situation. In my case my therapist kept calling me my legal name and not my chosen one.

Good luck, pal!
To me this sound like an attempt to force you into making her correct herself by you telling again your pronouns to just her check if it was like a ""phase"", I mean, there is some therapist over there that wants you to keep affirming who you are before ending up saying ""yep you definitely are, I am calling you by your pronouns"" and proceeds to do so
Hey,
I'm really sorry that you're going through an anxious time. Be strong, okay?

At some point you're going to need to develop confidence in your identity. Take the opportunity to correct someone now, whom you are paying to be in your corner and supportive to you. I promise it will only get easier. You definitely should stand up for yourself and correct her if it bothers you. If it continues, you can say something along the lines of ""Listen, I've already told you that I am transgender and these are my pronouns. Since then it just seems like you've put very little effort into supporting me in this, so I think it's time that we part ways.""

I am always in favor of working things out amicably. Maybe you can try the ""three strikes, you're out"" approach if you want to set up a boundary to help yourself.
You should just politely remind her that you’re transgender and that this is how you prefer to be seen. Give people a chance to change and they’ll surprise you.
I understand wanting to avoid conflict. However, this is definitely a growth opportunity for you. If you're able to, you should express the discomfort being misgendered causes you. But all therapists are equipped to deal with LGBTQ+ issues well. In general some therapists just don't fit us and we need to find a new one.

Staying with a therapist that doesn't fit you is like staying in a bad marriage, it's counterproductive. You have a couple of choices here. You can find a new therapist, schedule an appointment and cancel the upcoming appointments with your current therapist and just move on. You could cancel your upcoming appointments and then start the search for a new therapist. What is did was tell my therapist of 3 years (it was a good relationship for what I started working on) that I needed to work on sexuality and gender issues and was going to find a different therapist for that. He was completely supportive of that and appreciated the ""breakup"" vs being ghosted. It have him some closure.

You should definitely consider looking for an LGBTQ+ *affirming* therapist. Just make sure that they are able to help you with whatever issue cause you to seek therapy.
Is she maybe guaging your reaction or perhaps trying to get you to open up and talk?
For therapy to be effective, you must be heard and understood. I would revisit this with the therapist asap. If it cannot be resolved, a different therapist is my suggestion.
damn that's tough, it happened to me as well, hope you find a better therapist..
Mine is like this too
shes YOUR therapist. id just plainly say hey, can you make a note or something to use he/him with me, and if she doesnt, find a new therapist! honestly she probably forgot with how much people she switched between but that should have been something to make note of on her end.
^this. You might just need to remind them and give them time to adjust.
She is getting paid to pay attention. This isn’t a casual encounter where making mistakes is understandable. Therapy is supposed to raise you up, not pull you down.
>walk out the moment it happens and find a new therapist

Ideally skip straight to this part
sadly, no. i was too scared of doing it (even when she was nice the first time) i thought that she would get mad or smth and i overthought the entire interaction and then the moment passed so i couldn't.
If she's a good therapist, she should have made a note about it in her file. If the therapist is serious and cares, they make a note of important stuff like that. So either she just forgot (which is bad, but forgive able, and op can just make sure she notes it this time) or she didn't think it was important.

Either way, it's not really a good sign. I don't want a therapist who has so many clients they can't give me the care and attention I deserve and am paying for.
I don't think skipping right to outrage is the ideal response. It's always better to try and work with someone unless they are acting in bad faith. It sounds like this therapist is friendly but maybe isn't as familiar with transgender issues. And a kind reminder of expectations could go a long way here.
Well if she gets mad, she’s not the right therapist for you anyway.
The problem is that this kind of incident can quickly erode your trust in someone, and with a therapist that's not a small problem.
That's why I said speak up and address it right away. If you can't find common ground, then absolutely cut ties."	zwuwea	trans	84	0.97	2022-12-28 00:17:27
Got dead named and misgendered intentionally all day yesterday. Happy holidays! Hope I’m passing lol.		"How could someone see anything but a gorgeous woman? That’s wild to me! You look amazing.
Wow, what a bunch of disgusting pieces of shit!

I know what that’s like, too. Dead named from the moment I came out at work, all the way to the moment I left.

Fuckers.

Also, you’re so beautiful!!!
You're passing, I'd recommend telling the misgendering bastards to get an eye exam- because clearly theirs ain't working.
Most certainly
Looking fantastic girl 💗 happy holidays for you 💋

how to change your perception of a trans family member	Hi! I'm not sure if this is the right sub but I thought I'd ask how to change my perception of my cousins gender, if I say something offensive please let me know!! Recently my cousin recently came out as transgender (ftm) I have absolutely no problem with them and Im so happy that he is discovering himself and I'm hoping we can go to pride together as I recently came out to him as unlabeled , I don't see him very often (maybe once every 3 months) however every time I think of him my brain uses she/her pronouns and their dead name which is extremely frustrating because they are not a women, I'm afraid I'll accidentally misgender them by accident and I really don't want to hurt him, any suggestions are welcome, thank you so much for reading my short rant 😅	"Think about him as much as possible while using the right pronouns + name in your head, mumble to yourself about him, anything to get you using his pronouns + name more so you can get used to how it feels
As they say: practice makes perfect! I recommend that you practice in your head and aloud sentences that would involve your cousin. You can treat it like learning a new language.

When it comes towards making mistakes, I would advise that you don’t dwell on it when you do. Say you’re sorry, correct yourself, and then go on with your conversations.
You sound like you're doing great. I'll let you in on a secret, it took me a few months to stop occasionally thinking of MYSELF as a woman when I came out to myself. It's just a habit. It doesn't mean that you're being transphobic or unsupportive, just that you have a habit that's formed over time. Give it a while and you'll make new memories with your cousin and form a new habit! good luck!
It takes practice. Just let them know that you are trying and you may make mistakes but it’s unintentional. They just need to be patient with you. You got this.
When you are talking to him and you inevitably misgender or deadname, don't panic, don't explain why you did it, just correct yourself and move on. 

Lingering makes it worse.
Training
if a friend comes out or i’m struggling with pronouns for some reason i like to mentally tell myself about that person like i’m telling someone else about them. “—— is my friend. i met them ———. they like to —— for fun and my favorite memory with them is ——-.” etc etc
Whenever you hear yourself say that in your head, go ""no- he/they/their name"" also do that when you do it out loud too.
I say just tell your cousin and be open and honest. Say that you're struggling to get it to stick in your brain so if you misgender or deadname them, you're sorry and that you are trying your best :)
Practice! Internally tell yourself little stories, correcting it if you get wrong. Tell a little story about him aloud to yourself. It’ll just take some time. You’ve totally got this.
the eyes have it, look at pictures of his eyes and reorient yer perception imo
Honestly? Just time and practice. Its been 3 years and my dad still sometimes messes up haha.

Just make sure every time you misgender him that you correct yourself :)
Tbh, that's pretty common, especially if you know someone for a very long time just out of habit. One of my close friends came out as trans around the same time I did and even though neither of us would ever intentionally misgender the other we've both done it on accident once or twice. The more you interact with him/make a conscious effort to use the correct pronouns the more it will become internalized until it feels natural. Also this is just me personally, but generally most people I know don't really take offense as long as it seems like the other person is at least trying.
Practice makes perfect. Try to practice writing different sentences about him, and read them back to yourself aloud.

Trans people understand that misgendering sometimes happens. The best thing you can do is correct yourself briefly and move on. (Ex. ""I saw her-- sorry, him, walking by the pool""). Making a big deal of it/derailing the conversation to be about your slip-up can be very uncomfortable and potentially more upsetting. 

If your cousin uses he/they pronouns, it looks like you're doing great! 

If your cousin has requested just he/him however, avoid using they/them where possible. They/them works fantastically for nonbinary people and strangers/people whose gender you don't know, but if you know that a person only uses he/him pronouns, then they/them can feel like ""avoiding"" his gender or going for a so-called ""middle ground"" to avoid his actual requested pronouns. 

Best of luck!
Thank you so much! This makes alot more sense as my best friend is trans and I see her nearly every day yet I don't seem to have a problem misgendering her! Can't believe I didn't think of this
Thank you so much for your advice!! I'll definitely be doing that
Thank you!
I second this
Sorry wdym? Do you mean practice using their correct pronouns?
Thank you I think this will help!!
I did that with my friend when they came out and I started naturally using the correct pronouns within a week without slipping up (except for once, but I did make them cookies as an apology after). Good luck!
Yes, exactly, practice in your head until it works automatically.
Thank you so much!!"	vgc766	trans	89	0.99	2022-06-20 03:47:15
How Do I Cope with the Childhood I Never Had? (23 MtF)	"I'm grateful to have finally realized that I'm a trans woman, but as is the case with a lot of us, dysphoria and self-doubt have been creeping in. Maybe one day in the distant future my family will be accepting, but that seems like a long ways away, and for now I'm clinging onto the ways I can experience euphoria.

One of the biggest sources of pain came from seeing my family members recently attend a quinceañera (a Mexican coming of age party for 15 year old girls) and I got sad knowing that I would never get to have one. There aren't many women in my family, but everyone has had one, and instead of getting a coming of age celebration where everyone gets to see me become a woman, I instead have to fight for a handful of specific family members to accept me as a woman while the rest misgender and disown me.

It got me sad about all the other events and milestones I could have experienced if I had realized sooner in my life, but because of the transphobic and homophobia in my household, I couldn't realize until 23, now that I'm done with high school and college. I wish I could have gone to homecoming and prom in a dress. I wish I would have befriended my LGBTQ+ peers in High School instead of thinking I didn't belong. I wish I could have joined my cousins and friends for girls nights. I wish I could have played with easy bake ovens and painted my hair instead of being forced to play sports and be told I was a wimp. And I wish I could have pictures of a younger smaller me but as a girl.

All of those chances are behind me, and right now I'm pretty lonely as I search for jobs with a film degree that hasn't done much to help right now. I'm living in a small town with my partner who does love and support me, but I have no friends aside from a small handful of online friends, and I barely talk to my family (aside from a couple of supportive cousins I've come out to). Trying to embrace being a girl for the first time in my 20s feels weird. It's hard when cis women have had such a head start. It infuriates me knowing that there will always be records of me as a cis male, and that my mom will always cling to those records/pictures and see that as the true me.

I never would have been supported if I came out while younger, but I want those experiences I missed out on, not things that trans women can't experience, but certain milestones and events that I could have had. I feel like my only real hope for being involved with these experiences is to have a daughter when I become a parent, but even then, it's impossible to determine what gender child you get, and maybe they will identify as more masculine, and I don't want to be the parent that forces their child to have the things I never had even if they don't want it. Even then, it wouldn't be the same as experiencing those things firsthand.

I guess I'm trying to figure out where to go from here. I could throw myself an adult quince but for an older me to symbolize my transformation into being a trans woman haha, but I don't have enough close people in my life to go and right now I'm so self-conscious that it's hard to imagine anyone wanting to go there to validate me. I'm also getting married to a cis woman next year and that's already a nightmare to plan and we don't really have friends to invite, plus it would be awkward for a married adult woman to throw herself a quince. Honestly I'm also just in desparate need of friends, whether it be online or in person. I mostly just want to feel validated and special, and I wish I could justify having that as a trans woman. If anyone can help me feel better that would be appreciated. I'm also looking for possible friends, especially trans people in their 20s also living in the US. Thanks for making it this far and creating a safe and supportive environment."	"If it makes you feel better, a lot of us feel this way.

And this is why finding a queer community is a good idea. I think they'd understand that you missed some stuff, and maybe help you make up for lost time.

I realized when I started HRT that I am in 2nd puberty, and am calling it a redo :p
23 is still young, btw. You have a lot of time for beautiful first times.
I would recommend getting involved in queer community, and specifically, putting yourself out there in terms of finding a sense of sisterhood with people? That’s something that has helped me make peace with my lost teenage years
Have a Ventiquinceañera? 

It being a misuse of the spanish language aside, invite your found family after you make it, and the friendly people in your family, and do those things now. It's not too late. Make new friends, do the things.
I'm also struggling with this. But I've talked to people about it and I think almost everyone feels that way, regardless of age - even teens mourn their lost years.

I'm not over it, but I feel like once I've gotten a taste of what the future could be like and actually have some hope for myself, dealing with my lost past will be easier.

I'm also not a psychologist, but your post kinda screams ""depression"" to me. I'd suggest seeking out treatment for that, if you have the option.
I think we all face this at some point. But what I realized is that while we may not have the TYPICAL childhood, we all have A childhood. And not everything has to be typical. I don't share a lot of what most girls experienced, but I still did things. I had friends. The experiences were real, and they shaped me. And my grappling with my identity was real and that shaped me too. So my recommendation is to avoid comparing your story to other people, and just accept that it's YOUR STORY.
Sad story :(
I'm just having a hard time finding that community. My town is small and I'm awkward when it comes to being outwardly social, but at the same time I love having good friends. I'm job hunting too and I don't know if I'll stay here too long, and I've already made and lost so many friends over the years because we never keep in touch.
This. Also a while ago i watched a video about this kind of stuff done by a transwoman, her suggestions was to, getting some of the toys you wanted as a kid and gathering and having slumber parties etc... silly or not, doing so probably would lif a lot of this mental weight on OP’s shoulders

I came out to my class!!	"Tldr at the bottom

Okay, this happened a few days ago, but i still wanna tell you lovely people about it. So i asked my biology teacher (who already knew) if i could do it at the beginning of her class, she was totally fine with that and changed her lesson schedule a bit so my ""speech"" could fit in. So there I was, standing in front of the class, almost at the breaking point of just running out of the class. But well, that didn't happen. You know how in movies there is always this moment when the main character gives a speech?? They can't do it, until their bff gives them like a nod or a thumbs up, and then they give the best speech ever. Well, i didn't think that was a real thing until last tuesday. So while standing there, i glanced over at my bff (it was kinda her idea lol) and she gave me this huge smile and thumbs up.

I told everyone i was trans (MtF), how i wanted to be named, what my pronouns are, how i hoped that everyone would try to use my name and pronouns as much as possible. That i wouldn't mind if they asked questions about anything and how i expected to be misgendered and misnamed a lot and that i dont really mind if they dont do it on purpose.

Well, it went better than i ever could've imagined. Litterally everyone was supportive, even the ""cool"" boys, where i had my doubts, were totally okay with it. 

Last friday (1 day after telling) i did get named correctly a lot, so i think that means that everyone does really thinks it okay.

Tldr: i came out to my class (MtF) and everyone was really supportive"	"Congratulations!  This was a gutsy thing for a young person to do.  I'm delighted that your classmates rose to the occasion and proved that they deserve to have such a bright, shining star in their worlds.

misgendered	"I'm so tired of being misgendered. I didn't start T, I'm not out to my family yet but I thought that I looked masculine. I'm misgendered everyday by random people in stores or coffee shops or wtv. I'm binding, I have really short hair, I dress masculine and people are like ""lady"" this, ""lady"" that and I'm so so tired. 
I'm thinking to stop going out and stay home everyday because it makes me so fucking sad.

What can I do to look like a fucking boy?"	"Hi! I’m AMAB. But, when I was a preteen in theater, we used stipple sponges and makeup to give us a 5 o’clock shadow. You have to play with it a lot to get it the way you want. But, stipples are stupid cheap and could help! Good luck, brother!
[Afab here] I'm having the same problem. I'm sure it's because of my voice. For the most part I move and look like a clean-shaven short fat man, but the second I open my mouth everyone knows. 

I have a pleasant voice - my nieces have always said that I sound like a disney princess.... But although that was fine when I was pretending to be a girl, it's just weird now. 

Go on, envision Danny Divito with Princess Ariel's voice.
Hang in there bro.

Society likes to gatekeep masculinity and I think this sadly means that people who are clocked as AFAB are often presumed to be women — like, it won’t cross their mind that they’re trans in the same way it might for a woman who’s clocked as AMAB. I am speculating here ofc. Is just my personal reading of things.

All I can say is this will pass. I relate to how tough this is and it was the worst part of my social transition. I did get through it and I’m sure you will too — you’ve come this far already, and you’re doing really well even just realising that you’re trans and coping everyday while closeted. The community is proud of you and is supporting you<3
If you want pointers, you can try posting to r/transpassing and people there might be able to give you some tips
Most people can't pass without hrt.
Shoulder pads!!!!!! Wearing jackets with shoulder pads it will make your silhouette a lot more masculine. Also it depends on your face shape but hats could help your face look more masculine along with fact that most people who wear like basbeball or flat bill hats are guys. This also depends on your style but you could wear doc martens, combat boots, chunky sneakers, etc that will make you taller. I hope these help!! 
EDIT
Also look up body shapes on google and find out what body shape you have and then look up fashion tips for guys with that body shape. Shorter guys who may have a rounder body shape might wear a suit with vertical stripes and black dress pants and black dress shirt to appear thinner and taller because black will make your body look smaller and vertical stripes will help people read you as taller as well and mens suits are made to make guys appear more tall having one block of color that goes from top to bottom will make you look taller.for another example you could have red pants and a red shirt that go good together, then you could wear a jacket with shoulder pads and vertical stripes or just anything that looks good the the red outfit. the red block of color will make you look taller on its own the vertical stripes would just add to the effect. Shorter necklaces like chains will make your shoulders look broader while longer necklaces will make them appear thinner. Same thing for necklines a deep v neck will make your shoulders appear thinner while a crewneck shirt would make them appear broader. Okay I think that’s all the tips I have. Actually one more thing horizontal stripes will also make your shoulders appear broader but they’ll also make you appear shorter.
All about a mind shift, gotta learn to not care about strangers perception of you. I look like a dude in every way but I'm always misgendered cause I have a big chest. Sucks but gotta stay strong
Hi! I just wanted to start this off with it definitely will get better and easier to pass in public. You won't be forever stuck in it. I know it's frustrating hearing that now but I was surprised that it did get easier myself. 
One thing that really has helped recently was getting pants that are lower waisted. You have no idea how much of a difference it makes!! It feels a little uncomfortable at first to wear pants lower on your hips but it definitely gives the appearance of a longer torso. :) 
And at the end of the day, the general public is stupid anyway and other trans people will see you for who you are in your heart. Soon the general public will catch up too but for now, do what makes you the most happy because the opinions of strangers really don't matter when you are looking like a fly guy. 
Stay cool and be safe!! B)
hey, I'm going through the same, it sucks I'm sorry that happened to you. i don't know any advice for you, people are just blind, i don't understand them. but you're not alone buddy :) good luck
Unfortunately the more you obsess over passing the more you'll get frustrated when you don't.  


Voice training, mascara beard and contour can help with passing tho, if you still wanna keep trying. People are super oblivious tho, even the well-meaning ones, so even that may not be enough.
I will try to find things like that! Thank you so much
I truly understand, I look like a clean shaved short fashionable man but when I talk people call me lady and stuff like that.
We will get through this bro! We are together fighting this, good luck on your journey
In terms of advice: I found shoulder exercises at the gym really helpful, and also painting on stubble + contouring your face can help.

I did occasionally pass pre-T but it is very difficult. I think something that helped me was looking like a fashionable man and not just a man if that makes sense. Basketball top, durag, nice tractors (I’m mixed so you might need to shake it up a bit). Looking like a certain kind of man on top of just looking like a man if ygm. But it’s still pretty difficult without hormones.
I'm almost crying, thank you so much, that means a lot to me <3
Thank you so much!
My friends tell me that I look masc but maybe I don't
Thank you so so much, this is so helpful.
I love to wear men suits because of that! I'll try those things, once again thank you
You right, we can get through this bro!
Thank you so much for those words, thank you so much for the validation! Stay cool!!
I'm sorry that happened to you too, we are together in this! Good luck
Maybe you right, thank you so much!
No problem! Just ask if you have any other questions. 💜
I try everyday to look like a fashionable man, I like fashion a lot. Thank you for your advice!
I'll try to exercise my shoulders too!
Maybe you do, maybe they're just trying to be supportive, maybe both. But looking masculine and looking like a man are different things. I'm sure you'll get there eventually. It may take a while and some effort but you'll likely get there.
Without t you most likely don’t
You right. I guess I need to wait and try new things to pass

It's been 10 months since I've started taking hormones and transitioning but I don't really see much progress. What do you guys think? Do I pass or not? I get misgendered a lot and my breasts barely grew an inch.		"You are half way there. Should look pretty fem by 18 months. Just keep going. Your lips and cheeks are definitely making progress.
I think you look very androgynous and could be seen either way.
At a first glance, I saw a chick. So you totally pass. Good luck with your journey!
The aura coming from you is very feminine. If I saw this photo and had to refer to you, I’d say she. 😊
Id say you look more feminine than masculine, but if you look closely there's a faint beard shadow, getting rid of that might help!
You pass with flying colors in my book, your eyes are gorgeous.
You could be on low dose. Talk to your doctor about increasing doses
Most people who miss gender are just bigots
You look gorgeos i think you will pass welcome
I think you look kinda halfway. Your upper half looks fem but your lips and jaw don't, so lets say is still a work in progress but no doubt you will be a beatiful lady
You look kinda androgynous for now but honestly even ten months isn't that big to make changes for some of us. Also i recommend you go go to hair removal cuz i can see some on your face, without them you'll look more feminine
I'll be patient. Thank you!
I see. Maybe in a few more months or years I'll look more feminine. Thank you very much! I always thought I look masculine.
I'm always worried whether I pass. Thank you very much. I'm happy to hear your words.
Really? I always thought I don't look feminine. I'm so happy, thank you. I'm always insecure about my face.
Do you have any advice on getting rid of facial hair? I shave them almost every day. It always grows back after a day or two. Not just my facial hair but my body hair either (chest, stomach, armpits, legs, etc.), they grow too fast.
Really? I'm so happy to hear that. Thank you!
Oh yeah that's why I love wearing face masks.
Yes, absolutely! I’m glad I could give you a dose of serotonin 🥰
Laser hair removal if you can afford it
I struggle with the same problem as you :( I've mostly given up and wear a mask all the time but I can see why that doesn't work for most ppl

Don’t be twofaced. (Vent)	"TW: Misgendering. 

Respect me or don’t but don’t talk about me behind my back. I use He/Him pronouns and go by Ari. I’ve worked at this store for over a year and been out the entire time. This isn’t new for anyone here. 

I found out two days ago from a coworker (we’ll call her Lisa) that another coworker (we’ll call him Bobert) doesn’t respect my pronouns whenever he isn’t in front of me. 

Lisa told me the conversation started when they were both closing, with him asking her if he looked like a liberal or conservative. As the conversation continued, he threw out a bunch of conservative views, and then threw me in as an example. 

“For example, Ari: I can’t look at her without seeing a her. I have a hard time remembering to use a different pronoun, she doesn’t look different. And besides, I don’t believe in that stuff.” 

Lisa to her credit corrected each pronoun and told him it’s a matter of respecting me and who I am, whether or not he agrees with it. He did not care. BUT to my face at work? Every day? He seems to put in a genuine effort. I’m mad and upset because it feels like he’s only doing so in public to not get in trouble or upset me. I know there will always be transphobes out there, and maybe I should be thankful that he’s doing anything at all for me even if he blatantly disrespects me behind closed doors. I dunno. All I know is I have a hard time looking at him right now.

Edit: spelling"	"Allies support trans people no matter what. He needs to check himself.
That sounds like an awful situation,I'm so sorry. Please confront him. If he is a genuine person,heb2ill apologise.
I think it would be better for both of them to report him to HR and let them deal with it. Employee confrontation like that seldom goes well.
True,honestly. Presuming HR aren't transphobic . If they are,then it's time for a lawyer.
Yep. I agree with you there."	ttsfoc	trans	84	0.95	2022-04-01 14:45:49
getting misgendered when ppl never even saw you	"so i'm a trans girl (she/her), and this has been an anxiety of mine for a while that i at least hadn't noticed being actually fulfilled until just now. my anxiety over it has led to me decorating my previous cars with lesbian flags and gender-specific joke stickers and stuff to try my hardest to stop it happening, but my current car doesn't have any (yet).

a lot of people, including my parents, seem to ALWAYS default to every car on the fucking road being driven by a ""him"" (*like wtf the word them exists guys*). and i was just hanging out in the back of my car with the curtains drawn in a car park (#vanlife), and heard someone outside talking about my car say ""and look at his license plate up top there"" (my plate is mounted on the roof rack with all my adventure gear) and it just - fuck. i worry about other people's perception of me a lot, it's probably my biggest source of dysphoria. especially as a car girl in a world where the car scene is widely believed to be like 99% men, and i want to help represent the women who like cars! but i can't even escape misgendering when they're not even fucking seeing or hearing me. why do we have to live in a world where men are the default on everything. i hate it so much

anyway i'll probably order some lesbian flag stickers to give myself more confidence lol"	"I don't drive but I can totally relate on that with multiplayer video games
Yeah people are definately sexist in assuming the gender of people they have very limited info on (even when they don’t mean to) Adding stereotypical feminine decorations might help or gender specific jokes like your old car. If it’s any consolation they definately misgender cis women too
When I am misgendered by strangers, I remind myself that their choice of pronoun says more about them than me. There’s been times when someone has assumed I am a man. Usually when I am wearing no makeup, no earrings, short hair, and gender neutral clothes. And usually the person is of retirement age.  lol

To that person, a woman wears makeup, has long hair, etc; and they read my external look as masculine. It doesn’t define who I am. I love me and my unique version of being a woman. 

Personally, I reject any narrow definition of womanhood and move on with my life. I am far too complex to be defined by any label. 

Your version of woman sounds pretty awesome, BTW. “Adventure gear”?!? Holy hell! That sounds amazing!  Your woman-ness emits from your soul; from deep inside you. Trust that, and screw everyone else.
You need to drive a Subaru if you want people to assume it’s driven by a lesbian 😜
My deadname is foreign sounding even though I'm white. I've gotten used to all the assumptions after 2 decades of job/school interviews and hearing ""oh, I assumed you were Asian!""
Yeah, I live in a country where every word is gendered and neutral gender does not already exist, so the ""neutral"" is masculine, the gramatical rule is litteraly ""if there is a man in the room, everyone in this room will be masculine in their adjectives"", like, student translate to estudante, that is neutral (yeah, an exception), but ther is the world Aluno or Aluna, masculine and feminine respectively, and most teachers and professors use Alunos when enter the class room, just doesn't bother with your female students, call them with a masculine adjective and be gramatically correct. So being misgendered is pretty common here.
When I got a new car, I wanted to slap union and American flags on it, but nope.
oh yeah, this is why i don't play multiplayer games with any kind of chat beyond forza horizon's emotes lol
yeah it is a little consolation, like at least they're not being transphobic. just casually misogynistic ... i will happily add to the plentitude of heart shaped decorations though :) maybe the next person'll see them and assume correctly lol
I know plenty of people who just call everyone dude.
i do! in fact it's a 2004 Outback that says ""SUBUWU"" in iridescent letters on the windscreen and has stickers all over it lmao, i think that gen of Outback is the most lesbian car that exists honestly
Let me guess, some European language
Kinda funny how my slight derailment about video games circled back into Forza then, glad you have somewhere to drive without dealing with this
This is why i love Elden Ring so much. I get to still see other peoples messages and stuff, but its almost always shit like “still no head”, “behold, pickle”, and “hidden path ahead” with someone a few inches behind them saying “liar ahead” rather than just being harassed.
Unrelated question, how do I get the trans lesbian flag tag
dude is neutral though, i call everyone dude too (although a few people do use it as a gendered term so i can see why some would be uncomfortable with it, obviously i wouldn't call anyone dude who didn't want to be called it)

correcting people on my pronouns	"i’ve made a couple of posts like this over the last few months, trying to gain advice about it. 

i (20, non binary) got a new job (yay!) and it’s my first job being openly out as non binary. 

i told my boss, he knows and is supportive, he allowed me to put my pronouns (they/he) on my name tag, along with my preferred name. 

i wear masc clothes at work, i bind (thankfully i don’t have a big chest to begin with), and i wear a mask, but i haven’t started t yet-so my voice is still very feminine. 

my name tag says my pronouns, my name is an androgynous three letter name that doesn’t point to either gender-i’ve come to the conclusion that the thing that “gives me away” for lack of better words is my voice, which i can deal with. 

but what i have problems with is correcting people when they use the wrong pronouns to refer to me. even though it says it on my name tag, everyone still refers to me as “she” and it’s really starting to weigh on me. 

i finally got the courage to correct someone yesterday, but he just laughed in my face, so i just stayed quiet and kept dealing with the misgendering.  

i guess im asking what y’all say when you correct people? or if you have any advice for ignoring people like the dude who laughed at me?"	"Also, my therapist suggested that I set clear boundaries with those closer people in my life. 
Telling them what my name and pronouns are, why they should use them when addressing me, and the consequences that will happen if those boundaries are crossed. IE distancing myself from them, less contact, or a firm talking to as a last chance to keep me in their lives. Demand respect and if they cross that boundary then they have been informed what they need to do to have you in their lives.

Hope that could be helpful
I forcefully say I'm not a girl instead of saying ""my preferred pronouns are"" because if I say that those people think they have the choice to use my correct pronouns. They don't, I will yeet them out of a window if they disrespect me on purpose.
Does your workplace have any sort of discrimination policy to protect their employees? Would there be a management response if inappropriate racial language was used, for example? You should ask your boss about this. 

At my work I had a customer call me “it” in front of a manager. I got heated as I’m only out recently and that was the first time that had happened to me, and I had to walk away before it escalated.  I had a chat with that manager the next day and we established that if something like that happens again depending on what it is I can correct them, and if it’s malicious we will ask them to leave. 

Just the peace of mind knowing my bosses have my back is so relieving especially as I’m in a leadership position and have to talk to upset customers.
I work at a bar, I wear a mask so the most non passing parts of my face are covered, I have hair down to mid back, my work shirt is tied off to show off my stomach, and my glasses are pink and sparkly.

People keep calling me sir.
I completely feel you on this. As a trans femme person who started HRT at 30 my voice is locked in at an all time low pitch. Not matter how I look my voice gives me away to people who just don’t understand.

What I’ve come to the conclusion is that correctly random strangers to use my proper pronouns becomes absolutely draining because it’s so regular. Which sucks. But I am completely confident and okay correctly coworkers/friends/family every time they do it. Because those are people I’ll be around more often and want them to see me for who I am. I can’t expect random custys to see me for who I am. So for the sake of my mental health I say “water off a ducks back” when it happens with strangers. But 100% will always let people closer to me know that it’s hurtful and causes me harm when they don’t use my name/pronoun.
Do you feel comfortable speaking to your boss about this? Your co-worker is disrespecting you. You don't even need to make it about being trans: you have told this co-worker what you prefer to be called and he has refused to respect you. How can you be expected to work normally in such a hostile environment?
How about you start calling the dude who laughed at you a she, and if he says anything about it, ask how it feels. I'm serious. Give them a taste of their own medicine.
that is very helpful thank you!! 

for now i’m still not out to my whole family, just one of my brothers, who definitely supports me and feels bad when he has to use the wrong name and pronouns when talking to my parents. but i will definitely take this advice for when i come out to the rest of my family :)
i’ve also been trying to see the first comment you left, and i haven’t been able to read it!! it keeps not showing up when i click on the comments here, yet shows that you said more than one thing lol
yea i’ve nyxed saying “my preferred pronouns” and swapped it for “actually its they/them”…which prompted the laughing. which hurt, but i was a little proud of myself for speaking up even a little.
im gonna ask the next time i see my manager in person, but there definitely is im just not aware on the specifics of it yet. 

i am glad that my boss is being as supportive as he has been so far, so i’m not worried about reaching out to him about this stuff
i got called mister from behind once, but when i turned around she “corrected” herself and said maam. 

that one im still confused about tbh, and was on of the ones that hurt more
the person who laughed at me was a customer, but my coworkers misgender me as well. 

where it gets kind of tricky is that i work *at* a store, as a salesperson, but i don’t work *for* the store, in the sense that my manger and their mangers are completely different people. 

i ended up leaving a post it behind the counter for my coworkers saying that my pronouns are they them or he him so hopefully that curves the coworker problem. 

but i’ll definitely reach out to my manager about what to do in customer interactions
oh believe me i thought about it!! if he comes back (and he probably will-i have a couple regular customers) and does it again i’ll say something to him as well as my manager.
This doesn’t work. Cis people don’t experience dysphoria like we do, they can just laugh it off whereas it’s deeply painful if you’re trans.
Best of luck! I’m rooting for you 💜🏳️‍⚧️

ahh i'm sorry you have to deal with this. I'm not really sure what I would suggest doing with customers other than asserting yourself and trying not to let it get you down too hard. interacting with the public sucks, when i was working retail i mostly just... *let* people misgender me. but i don't think i would like that anymore.
yea,,,when i got the job i was like “yea i don’t think it’ll bother me that much i don’t think it’ll happen that often”. i greatly overestimated the people in my area.
I would suggest you put your new pronouns as she/they and the misgendering might stop. People suck and they especially suck for trans people, but the reverse psychology might just work.
im not sure i feel comfortable putting the wrong pronouns on something that identifies me, but i’ll keep that in the back of my mind lol

anyone other trans men get mistaken for trans women?	"I don't pass exceptionally well, but I do? kind of sort of. My voice is androgynous and I go by he/him pronouns with a masculine name (Michael). However, do to some pretty complicated circumstances- I can often times get misgendered and deadnamed by people I haven't outright told.

So when telling someone- usually a new friend or friendly acquaintance that yes, I am indeed trans, I usually get asked if I'm a trans guy or a trans girl

I'm not taking about people getting the terms wrong or anything- like I legitimately get asked if I'm transitioning to a woman (im not sure if that's the correct way to say that)

First time it happened was when someone told me and my best friend- another trans guy and mentioned how they could tell my friend was ftm but thought I was a mtf??? I thought it was funny at first but now it's just kinda tiring"	"With me is the reverse, I'm a transwoman, and one of my friends thinked for months that I was a closeted trans man (I'm a little tomboysh)
They do that shit to me all the time. They're just confused... I'm like ""no fucking way I pass as mtf when I'm afab...""  confusion from both parts lol
I told a guy in work I was transitioning, he hasn't seen me in person for two years since we started working from home, and he said, ""Yeah, I could kind of tell when I met you.""

That was a surprise, because we met 7 years ago and I only started transitioning 1 year before this conversation. When I asked how he could tell so long before I could, he said I had androgynous features and couldn't grow facial hair to save my life, so I must have been a trans man.

He was so confused when I told him I'm transitioning MtF. What made it all the more baffling was that when I worked here before moving to another company and back, he and I had went on a night out to the gay district of the next city over, and I had explicitly talked about wanting to do it again, but in drag. Must have been very bizarre from his perspective.

Cis people don't got a clue
When I first went to Planned Parenthood to start T, they gave me an MtF informational packet 😳
Yea it sucks, my parents are always misgendering me and deadnaming me, sometimes it’s hard to tell if they do it on purpose or they just forget. Real fing tired of it.
Everytime I come out to someone they have no clue which direction I'm going(mtf), I take it as a compliment I guess.
Happens to me all the time (especially as soon as they look at my arms - before testosterone! )
long before i realized i was a trans man, i had a handful of people who thought i was a trans girl and they were genuinely surprised when i said i was afab. i took offense when i first heard it, but now, after discovering that i’m transmasc, i don’t know what to think
Oh no- Must of been a big shock to both of you?
Yeah, he was my husband friend and knew he was bi, so he thinked that I don't knew it and not shared that I was trans thinking my husband was straight, and my husband told that he knew that I was trans and asked why I should be afraid of him being straight, and my friend was so confuse, I explained that I am a woman, a trans woman, and we laughed so much, he paid our marriage, he is a lovable friend"	tekkdo	trans	81	0.98	2022-03-15 08:53:31
Grandparent	"I'm a father of a trans son and I have been struggling with something and could use some advice.

For some background, my father and I have been estranged for a few decades and have just started speaking again.  He doesn't know about my son yet, and he has always been pretty conservative.  I need to talk to him about my son transitioning, but a big part of me is afraid to tell him.  He is the last family I have left outside of my kids, and I'm afraid of losing him again.

I am not ashamed of my son in any way.  I'm just worried about my father reacting badly or refusing to accept my son.  In either case, I will always stand by my son without question or hesitation.  I worry that I'm being a bad father for dancing around this subject with my dad.  I get very uncomfortable whenever he dead names my son or misgenders him.  

I've been struggling with this for a few weeks now and am still trying to figure out how to even go about that conversation.  I would welcome any insight people may have."	"Im sorry if this seems hurtful, but dancing around the subject with your father is hurting your son, or is going to when he finds out. You're his father, and his shield, and if he sees your father misgender him, or deadname him when you are around it's a surefire path to resentment. Worse he may internlize that resentment on himself. 

As for a conversation with your father? Sit him down and have a chat man to man. Let him know you want a relationship with him, but your son comes first, if he cant respect your son, how can you respect him? Let him know this isnt an argument, its not something you are going to fight with him over. Questions in good faith are fine, they mean he wants to understand or is trying to. But above all, be firm, be polite, and set boundaries. Also there is a difference between grudging acceptance, real acceptance, and support. Your son deserves the latter two from his grandfather, please don't settle.
no grandparent that is unwilling to learn is worth being a grandparent. you get uncomfortable, think of how he feels? you want to keep a connection recently brought back, but I bet your son doesn't want to lose the connection with you he already has. I feel you are ruining that by dancing around the thought of yelling your own dad to learn or get out of the life you're making with your son.
does your son want to be out to your dad?
Family isn't the blood you're genetically related to.

Family are the people who have your back when the chips are down. The ones you turn to when your back is up against the wall. The people you would drop anything to help.
I would never allow that to happen.  I know how much those things hurt him.  That's why I'm on here tbh.  I have to deal with this before there is any contact between them.
People sometimes surprise you. I recommend not drawing any conclusions about your father's views before you've even talked to him about this.
Tell him, and make damn sure you pick your son. If he’s not gonna respect your son he doesn’t belong in either of your lives.
So, I'm in the child's position here, but I'm going to offer my take -  

I'm 34 MtF. I'm not out to my grandparents yet, but I'm out to everyone else in my life (except work). My dad has been having a hard time with it, but is working to accept me, so I'm being patient with him.  

My dad's biggest fear is the response from his parents. Like your father, they're hardcore conservative. But here's my take on that: they've known me for 34 years. I've been nothing but kind, living, and respectful to them. I've bent over backwards to help care for them when needed. I'm always there for them. They know me well enough and should be able to reciprocate respect. I'm asking one thing from them.  

At the end of the day, it's up to them how they react. Not me. Not my dad. Only them. We can help guide them but we can't fix them. And if they can't come to accept me, I will have no problem cutting them off. It'll hurt a bit, but it's still on them that Christmas is ruined. Because, at the end of the day, bigotry eventually hurts us all.   

If it wasn't this - me coming out as trans - then it was going to be something else. Maybe my sister coming out as bi or dating a black person. Maybe my cousin being gay. Who knows? But at some point, their bigotry would bite us in the butt. And that's on them.   

What's important here is your son. But you'll have to stand up for him in a difficult way. And it might require you to put your foot down and draw a line in the sand with your father. It's gonna be hard. But I the end, we should all be doing this with the bigots in our lives anyway. We need to make bigotry unacceptable and this is a step toward that.  

Good luck, but know everything's going to be ok.
I think you should tell your father, but make it matter of fact, just an interesting tidbit you wanted to share. 

I was the child in this situation (though a grown adult in actuality). My mother refused to tell her father (he was a racist/generally intolerant and she thought he wouldn’t understand), and it effectively ended our relationship. I didn’t attend his funeral due to the way she ""handled"" my transition with the rest of the family, and it still bothers me.
Ditch him if he's a bigot
My mother essentially forced me to stay in the closet until my grandmother (her mother) passed away because she didn't want to deal with any potential issues. It hurt like hell then and I still struggle to forgive her for that. Yes, it would've been difficult and uncomfortable and there may have been arguments, but she chose to make me live through years of my entire family constantly misgendering and deadnaming me because she didn't want to have a hard talk with her mom. Don't be like that. 

You say your son means everything to you. I'm glad. Too few of us have parents who support us 100%. I'm glad he does. The talk you're going to have is very likely going to be difficult. It's possible it may turn into an argument. You may very well, as you fear, lose him again - but if the choice is betraying your own child to keep a man in your life who was out of it for decades? That's no choice at all. 

I can imagine how difficult it may be to think that your father may reject your son's identity, and that his refusal to treat your son as the person he is may well cause you two to split again. Your feelings on that are legitimate and valid, and you are not a bad person for being afraid or wanting to both keep your father in your life and support your son. However delaying and dancing around the subject isn't going to help at all. Make a plan for your conversation with him, and have it. Be prepared for things to go badly, but hope for the best. Think about the kind of questions he might have and prepare answers for that. Be honest and forthright and let him know that it's okay if he doesn't fully understand or even if he never really 'gets it'. It isn't about being able to 100% empathize - it's about treating your son with the basic respect he deserves and using his actual name and pronouns. 

As others have said, he may surprise you. And he may not, but may get better with time. Don't give up if he isn't immediately receptive, but make it crystal clear that while slip-ups can happen, intentionally misgendering or deadnaming your son won't be tolerated. And talk to your son first. Ask him what he would want you to say. Hell, ask him if he even wants you to talk to your father about this - maybe he would want to come out to his grandfather himself, or would want for you to be there supporting him. If nothing else, make sure you have a firm grasp on what your son is alright with you telling him and how. Coming out to people is tough, coming out to family can be outright terrifying, but having someone out you to family without your consent or guidance? That's full on panic attack inducing horrific. 

Anyway, this post has gone all which ways but I hope this is of at least some help to you. Feel free to PM me as well if you'd like to talk more.
I would always side with my son.  There is no question there.  I am very proud of the person he is and am not in any way ashamed.  If you don't accept my kid, I'm done with you really.  My kids will always be my priority, everyone else is secondary.
Not sure, but I do know how much being dead named and misgendered hurts him.  It's crushing to him.  He doesn't like being outed to people that didn't know him before he started transitioning.  Besides, the name would give it away and he's getting top surgery soon as well.
that's the attitude that your son is looking for. that's the attitude most trans kids look for, afaik. keep that energy when talking with your father. you're already doing great, imho. and that's coming from a ghost mom (trans parent).
Definitely ask first if he's comfortable with it first before potentially outing him
Yeah, it might also be a good idea to also talk with your son about your dad and all you're saying here. Basically, tell your son that you want to talk to your dad about him, mention everything your said here, that you'll always stand by his side and support him, and you will choose him over your dad. You know, just everything. Especially if your son is old enough to understand how those things go, I would ""include"" him in the thought process. Talk with him and ask him what he thinks, if he's ok with that, if he wants to assist you in the process of talking to your dad (and if this is what you want too ofc! And if you think it could be helpful too). I'm pretty sure it would be better to let him know about it, than just telling him after some time ""welp, too bad, your granddad is a dick and we'll never see him again!"". I'm sure you'll figure out the details of this, and what's the best thing to do, but I'd agree that involving your son in some way might be a good idea.
This. Your son might not want to have a potentially confrontational relationship with his grandfather at this point in time, so it's definitely something you two should have a conversation about before you proceed. If your son understands the pros and cons and your own concerns maybe there is a solution that you can reach that doesn't involve coming out now, or that sets some ground rules for how you approach the relationship with his grandfather after that."	w4d4kn	trans	77	0.98	2022-07-21 10:22:13
Mfw I go out and no one misgenders me 😎		"[deleted]
Ahhhhh! 😭❤ ur too kind. You're beautiful also <333"	i71n74	trans	79	0.96	2020-08-10 09:26:40
i really hate being trans and it makes me feel so guilty	"i hate coming out. i hate having to prove myself. i hate being the odd one out, no matter who i'm placed with. 

i hate doctor's appointments and clinic waittimes and medical gatekeeping. I hate ignorant nurses who misgender you when they think you're not looking and doctors who know but just don't give a shit. 

i hate being the only person in the room asked their pronouns. i hate cis allies falling over themselves to apologize when they get it wrong. i hate being too anxious to correct anybody.

i hate being 'the girls.. and ______'. i hate swimsuits and changerooms and clothes that will never fit right. i hate hairdressers who fuck me over and how expensive it is to buy the shit that makes my body feel right.

i hate online quizzes and forums that tell me to seek help and second guessing myself every time i look in the mirror. i hate how noone sees me as i see myself.

i hate the world we live in and that my existence is debated in court and preached as a sin. i hate that me feeling true to myself is an act of rebellion and gets me ostracized. 

i hate being pulled to the side randomly and have people ask me if i am, and then them saying that they totally guessed. i hate people telling me that i shoukd have known earlier or there should have been more signs when i was young so i can't really be trans.

i hate how much i hate this. i love my trans friends. for years before i figured it out, i was a huge trans rights activist. i feel terrible for hating this so much but i can't do this. I'm not even a binary trans person (i don't think) but i would give everything i have to be born in the body of the opposite gender and to be cis

i'm sorry, i just had nowhere else to put this. i'm angry and bitter and i feel so guilty for feeling like this when i have it better than so many other people

thank you for reading this far if you did. i just needed to yell into the void for a bit"	"Don't feel guilty: I've read what you've written and it seems like you hate your struggle, not being trans itself and definitely you don't seem to be hating trans people.
And take care
It's tough. It really is. I hear you on that. I hated it too. For me, part of beginning to accept it was coming to terms the fact that I may never be totally comfortable with it, and that that's okay.

But don't feel guilty. Being transgender is just something that happens. I think of it like gravity. You can try to deny it away, fight it, repress it, pretend it doesn't exist, ect. but it's a thing that's there to deal with.

Part of the way forward might already be in your comment. The more I meet other transgender people, the more I admire and love them. It's society that has ingrained all these gender ""norms"", and people who don't adhere to those ""rules"" are often the most interesting, well rounded, and open minded people I've met. And there are a lot of genuine cis allies out there too.

Gender support groups helped me a lot, gave me much needed perspective, and got me out of my head when I was in a dangerous spiral of negativity.

All the best to you! ❤️
Dear, I’m so sorry you’re suffering like this. I don’t have words of profound wisdom but my heart goes out to you. *hugs *
I know it's hard, and I feel your struggle, I really do. Trust me when I say it's the other people who are in the wrong, *not* you, so don't feel guilty about it. Some people don't understand and others just like being jerks because it feels good to them. Whatever the case, don't give up and don't stop chasing whatever it is that will make you feel like yourself. It will be hard, but that's just the way things are sometimes, and everything always turns out right in the end somehow. I always say if you wouldn't take advice from someone, don't take their criticism either. You have a right to your own feelings, nobody should have the privilege to manipulate them in ways that are harmful to you. Don't let them. I believe in you.
I've been forcibly Detransitioned 3 times. These feelings are normal hun. They do not make you less Valid.
Old little me hiding in the void, listening to your words and secretly wishing you all the best and that you find your place in this world. 🤗💕

is it normal to become kind of numb for a few minutes after being misgendered?	"The title explains it. Every time someone who knows that I'm trans misgenderes me without apologizing after i tell them, i kind of become numb for a few minutes, where i feel kind of empty. Is that normal? 

(I'm a FTM (17))"	"Dysphoria, much like many mental affects, is definitely a case-by-case experience. I'd personally say a numb, empty feeling, while not totally common is a very reasonable coping mechanism for filtering out the bombardment of feelings you may be experiencing in that moment. If the feeling is fairly manageable, I wouldn't let it get to you, but any feeling that's causing you distress, particularly if it becomes prolonged or more severe is worth bringing up with a professional

Edit: Follow up, if friends/family seem to be actively ignoring your corrections, the feeling is even more valid. It could be worth it to sit the person/people in question down and express how it makes you feel. If they continue the behaviour, it may be time to re-assess your relationship with them
Happens to me because of the dissociation. Too much emotional impact so I disconnect from my feelings. It can be for a short while or for months, depends on what happens. It's creepy.
Ya thats depersonalization which is a coping mechanism
I had someone send me a transphobic reply and while the actual content was predictable and as one note as transphobes are, it still knocked the wind out of my sails for the rest of the night. Dysphoria is a hell of a drug!
Yeah it be like that
Yup, I get the same.  And it doesn't help that I am terrified of confrontation so only correct once in a blue moon and just deal with the fleeting numbness of disappointment and disassociation
That is def one of the relatively common reactions to misgendering, yeah.
Trauma response
The numb feeling may be your brain's way of keeping going when it's really distressing to be misgendered. It happens to some people, but maybe not everyone.

After this numb feeling passes, it helps me to give myself a few minutes (or longer) to reassure myself that it's ok, and I didn't do anything wrong. This might bring up an emotion you felt at the time (for me, that is often intense sadness or anger), which you couldn't express at the time.
This is all ok, completely natural and a way you may have learned to keep yourself safe. As long as you are safe and feel ok about it afterwards, it's one of those things that happens.

If, like some people (me included), it's distressing afterwards as well, you may want to discuss it with someone you can trust and explore it further. Or you might not, either way is ok!
yeah. i feel myself get hot like in the sense of embarrassment
For me it always felt like someone doused me with ice cold water through my insides leaving me numb and detached from my own skin. I hate the feeling so bad.
Yep, it makes me glad I can barely hear them sometimes.
Yes.
It used to cause us very bad dissociation as well.  Now we can at least handle it.
As an example, your flair gave me a split second of dysphoria like “no i’m not a girl!” And it wasn’t even directed at ME! (Circumstances exacerbated, staying with parents who accidentally misgender me and my wife because people make mistakes, still grates my nerves down) Normally i wouldnt even mention it, just wanted to illustrate that dysphoria shows itself sometimes predictably, sometimes “wtf? Why do i feel that way?” So yeah, it do be like
Dissociation is a common response that many people have to overwhelming situations. It does not necessarily point to trauma.

Particularly given that OP says it lasts for a brief period, they are aware it's happening and haven't expressed distress about it, I wouldn't jump to trauma.

Having said that, if anyone does experience this alongside distress and/or it feels out of control, it may well be something more like trauma.

Also, I acknowledge that for many people, living life as a queer person in today's society is traumatic - and I might not be making any sense.

Have a great day!
Same! Like my ears and cheeks feel like they are burning
For me its my cheeks and ears feeling like they are burning off, combined with a feeling like something inside of you suddenly went missing. I think the feeling holds on for like 10 minutes for me before slowly either getting upset or not reacting at all. Depending on if i know the person well.
I hope you're doing well♡
Your reality being dismissed is not traumatic?
Currently, we are doing wonderfully.  We hope that continues.
Not necessarily. Your reality being dismissed is hurtful, and will cause psychological pain. Whether or not that is traumatic depends on the person experiencing it.

https://www.mind.org.uk/information-support/types-of-mental-health-problems/trauma/about-trauma/
Going through stressful, frightening, or distressful events.  GOT IT
Pretty much - the only thing to add is that the event itself is less important than how that event feels to the person experiencing it. Some people are involved in a car crash and experience it as traumatic, other people don't.

The key thing with trauma is how did it affect the person experiencing it? The only person that can say whether someone is traumatised by an event is the person experiencing it.

That's my understanding at least, and also empowers the person experiencing whatever they are experiencing to decide what it means to them. In the end, trauma is about loss of safety for that person in a catastrophic way. What makes people feel safe or unsafe, and to what extent, is unique to each person, their past and their current perspective. There is no way from the outside to know."	zhpccz	trans	76	0.97	2022-12-10 10:38:21
My parents keep misgendering me	"I already told them everything, they know how I feel but, is like they're so convinced I'm not serious about it, or that I will forget about it.

Not a single time I heard from them my real name, they just deadname me and misgender me, is like they don't even try. Its been almost a month, a bit more than a month.

I try to say clearly ""No, I'm Pol"" or correct them in general but it feels so unsettling, is like I can't even do it, like I'm not allowed.

I'm so done already, I don't know how to copy with it, how to answer to them, how many times I have to tell them I'm not a girl, they're supposed to support and treat me the right way.

They just think I'm not ""experienced enough"", but WTF who are you to tell me that, about mYSELF. I'm fucking done and exhausted, I have a constant feel of anxiety, fear, regret and sadness, I'm so fucking done."	"My mother does the same thing. Apparently ‘I’m to young to know’. She refuses to use my pronouns and I didn’t bother with my name. I am going to try and ask why I’m to young to know and then give her some evidence to show that trans people find out their gender at really young ages. Maybe you should do a similar thing.
Default dance on them 😎
Do you have any affirming friends who can use your name and pronouns around your parents? That has helped me more than anything else. Also, unfortunately, it may just take some time. I've been out 5 years and my parents can't get my pronouns right, but they've finally started using my name.
Well refer to them as sperm donor and growth habitat see how that makes them feel
There was a meme that keeps popping up here and there, about how a brother/sister solved this problem for their trans sibling by using an airhorn at a family gathering every time the sibling got misgendered/deadnamed.

For a less aggressive and more passive-aggressive approach, ignore anything they tell to 'deadname' and only respond to what they tell to 'Pol' ( I think thats your name? I might have misunderstood your post. ).
I am angry for you even though I have a  sorta  have the support of mother I just got a wait because she had envisioned she was going to do all the girl things with me

Your best bet may be a total reframe. I've had a few parents come to me with concerns about their kids and I always ease them in with ""If you buy them a dress (or boxers and flannels, w,/e) what harm is that really going to do? Maybe they'll figure out it's not really for them but if you fight them on it they're just going to want to do it more, so my advice- let them do the thing."" If you frame it as what makes sense to them- an exploration, it isn't a power play at that point. 

As far as how to cope with them not respecting your pronouns- [gray rock](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/toxic-relationships/201911/the-price-and-payoff-gray-rock-strategy) them and gently correct them when the situation is safe to do so. It's a method that people use to deal with narcissists, but you can apply the technique here as well.
They way I handled it might be a bit hardcore but it worked.  


Whenever someone missgendered or deadnamed me, I didn't react or correct them ( especially when I couldn't just ignore them.)  


If that didn't help, I corrected them with a voice that basically said ""I am serious, do not cross me on this.""   


If that didn't help (only a few times) i slapped them. ""Small Slaps on the Back of the Head are good for your memory "" is  a saying we have in germany so I put it into practise. Only somewhat gently but it made the point.
Welcome to the club pal.
It may seem cruel, but they are your parents. Until you are emancipated or on your own, they have a right to call you by your given name.

You have to pick your battles.
Get an air horn, honk it every time they use the wrong pronouns or name.
that's a great idea!, maybe it could help my situation, thank you for the advice
I'm 25 and my family still struggles with this after 3 years.

Idk why, they are really supportive and hate themselves for doing so, but the simple are to stupid to get my pronouns right 🤷🏼‍♀️😩
So your mother thinks you're too young to know if you're trans but not too young to be cis? 👀👄👀
HAHAH WTF
That's so rough to hear, I'm sorry it's taking so long for you but I'm also really proud you've made it this far at the moment. And yes, I have a lot of people using my pronouns and my name but this holidays were too much for me.
Thank you for this reply, I've never seen the meme but I wish my siblings could do that, and yes, you're totally right my name is Pol ♥️
Also, that was actually something my Mum requestet, I made a Foto with make up and all to hammer home the point and put my Name beneath it.   


Worked so far, now if only they would get the spelling right...Eleanore isn't THAT complicated.
They have no such ""right"".
Wrong! Parents don't get to treat their kids however they want. This is emotional abuse. Fuck that noise!
Happy to help!
Basically. Not sure of the logic behind that though.
Or just whenever they deadname you cut them off by screaming ""POL"" at the top of your lungs. 💀💀
I'm not claiming that it's moral, but they do.
If it's truly abuse, then the authorities need to be notified.
you literally made my day HAHAHAH
If it's not physical the authorities won't do shit.

And honestly, even if it was physical, nine times out of ten the parent denies it, the authorities take them at their word, and the kid is left with the abusive parent.
What even was the point of your comment here? Other than to just bring someone further down than they already were? Cmon.

Looking at the account, they’re a troll. So yes, it was just to hurt people.

(Tw mention of Suicide) I got misgendered on my report card and I just can't take this anymore	"I just can't do this anymore. 

This just showed me everything I ever did (or thought I did) was worth nothing. 
Yeah I couldn't change any of my documents and stuff like that so I knew that would happen but what makes me so depressed about all of this is that it shows me how I have reached nothing until this point.

I outed myself to my class and they still misgender me constantly even when the topic is literally me being trans. They said they would support me and one of my classmates gave me her old makeup and I really appreciated that but now this is worth nothing when they don't even seem to try and the problem is that I am always too shy too correct them and now it's been too long so I can't correct them without having to answer why I haven't corrected them earlier.

So my outing was at least until now for nothing, I can start hrt in like 1,5 years (if I'm lucky), I couldn't change any of my documents yet and I barely pass or only pass when I try really hard and even then I think I look like shit.

Why should I even do anything anymore? 
Why should I keep trying?
I can't wait for so damn long just so I can start hrt which will take months until I see a difference.
I can't wait so long just so I can be happy with myself.

And for what do I do all of this?
So a great part of the people around me hate me for being trans, telling me they can ""clearly tell"" that I was born a guy and in general only feeling like a human when I'm around other queers?
Is that it?
Is that supposed to be my future life?
Even in my best moods I only imagine a future where I'd eiter deny to others that I'm trans or that I shelter myself from most humans.

That was my rant.
I just really needed to get this out.
I hope one day my opinions on my future and stuff can/will change but for now even my happiest future seems partially kinda depressing.

Edit: 
I think I'm gonna approach that one teacher that understood me the most, give her a letter that she then reads to the class while I'm gone and in the letter I'll tell them how much this hurts me and how I just want them to just respect me and who I am."	"Hey, I was in your place once, and I know it doesn’t seem like it will, but it gets better. I think your projecting how your feeling right now into the future, people tend to do that, I used to think I’d never ever look like a girl (Im mtf) no matter how hard I tried. From what I’ve seen in myself and in a lot of my trans friends, you see positive mental changes a lot faster than physical ones. Now that Im on hrt, even only for a month and I havent seen any physical changes, I feel like a girl wearing boys clothes. I know Im just a random gal on the internet, but hang in there! I know you can do it and I want you to know it really does get better.
Getting misgendered sucks... And hurts. I get dead named a lot because everyone knows my dead name. And when you're trans the future can seem far away, but the future will come. There's always gonna be assholes who don't respect us, but if you let that get to you they win. Stay strong. You're strong and you're going to get what you want. even if you don't see that right now.
Look you have nothing to be ashamed of I'm 29yo and I only wish I started my transition at your age. I've never even stepped outside dressed up before because I know my family would be like wtf? Trust me it feels like it was just yesterday I graduated but that was 11 years ago and I wish every single day that I could go back. Just like you will too one day.
These are people in your class. Not people around you that care. Relax, its just a part of being trans. People will misgender you. But you know that its not your true gender. And all that matters in the end, is how you feel about you. Not anyone else.
I get it.  The first year I came out as trans I nearly killed myself with alcohol.  It’ll sound cliche saying it gets better, but the fact is that early on in transition your life is in chaos.  Everything is difficult.  Hard truths are ahead.  That will most likely not be a permanent state of affairs.  Find good people who care and who at least try to understand.  Hold them close.  In time the chaos is likely to pass, your life will stabilize, you will get those hormones, and your life will be more brilliant than it was before.  But first it will be awful.  But you can do it.  it may feel far off, but some day you will be on the other side, and you will be tough as nails."	svjxgm	trans	77	0.96	2022-02-18 14:58:38
"The ""Ma'am"" Problem"	"I just came off three straight days of dealing with a Twitter mob that told me repeatedly that it's selfish, harmful, entitled, and *schizophrenic* to want strangers to not assume my gender, and use nongendered terms or pronouns (like they/them) to refer to me until they've had a chance to ask what my pronouns are. 

I've heard everything from ""there are only two genders, duh"" to ""it's misgendering to call me they/them, just assume my gender and call me she/her so you don't trigger my dysphoria.""

So... earlier today, at the grocery store, I was addressed as ""ma'am."" I present rather masc, but I have a voice that gives me away every time. In spite of the multiple they/them pins and patches I wear, I'm misgendered rather frequently. Some days I don't care. Today, it just made me feel icky. 

But I also feel guilty for reacting negatively to the misgendering. I think I've started to internalize some of the transphobic rhetoric around how overly sensitive we are as a group, and how I'm just ""acting the victim"" when I want people to not assume they can tell my gender by the sound of my voice. 

I'm tired. Worn down. Sad. And at the moment, rather dysphoric. I don't know what to do, or if I'm even allowed to feel the way I feel."	"You're not alone. I feel the same way. I'm like you--dress and present masc but my voice and other features out me as afab and get me read as female. Just last night I was so happy no one used gendered language toward me at a get together my friend arranged with people I hadn't met before. I thought about disclosing my pronouns from the beginning but I was exhausted after a long day of dealing with transphobia at work so I didn't feel like coming out to new people. But then someone started using she/her about me during a game we were playing near the end of the gathering and it sucked. It just sucks to be reminded of the fact I don't pass day in and day out. It's exhausting to have my gender constantly dictated by strangers  no matter how I present. I just wish people would use neutral language. It can be tricky sometimes-- I slip up at it myself-- but I feel like it's something we should be striving toward in a more trans-aware world.
I feel you, it’s exhausting to correct people constantly. If society could stop assuming and categorizing everyone in one of two boxes based on arbitrary standards that’d be nice. Unfortunately I don’t see that changing any time soon, so I just try my best to find ways to cope.

This is one of the reasons why I want hrt so badly. At least being assumed opposite of my agab wouldn’t feel as bad to me.
It’s certainly valid to feel the way you feel because you are feeling it, people just haven’t personally experienced the feeling so think it should be no gig deal since a privilege of being cis is you rarely get misgendered and song experience dysphoria if you do.

I will say it feels very personal since it hurts like daggers and conversely the euphoria from being properly gendered is amazing at first.  However, now that I’m used to it I can say people don’t even think about it.  It’s literally subconscious.  Obviously some people take the conscious effort to think about, but for most people it’s just automatic.  So, don’t taken it as intentional most times.  Secondly, it does get better both in terms of avoiding misgendering and the resulting dysphoria.
You're allowed to feel these feelings you're feeling. It's not just you. I work at a store, and when people think they're being polite, calling me ""ma'am"", it's not, and it makes me feel dysphoric too. It's hard. I get it. Hang in there... <3
It’s not your fault for being misgendered. Empty vessels make the most noise, which is why transphobes are so loud. Maybe to them sensitivity is asking for common courtesy. Looking at the number of deaths by men per year out of pure stubbornness, it seems like they do think that way. But they clearly aren’t correct.
You're definitely in the right here. Assuming someone's gender is asinine.
I’m so tired of feeling like asserting my personhood in any way, no matter how small, is seen as trying to be a victim. I’m not trying to my make my trans status a big deal (or any kind of deal at all) I just want to not be harassed…. Hang in there, friend
I've briefly considered HRT myself, but I like my singing voice too much to want it to change. *sigh* Can't have the cake and eat it too."	t2e9hd	trans	80	0.98	2022-02-27 02:59:46
Misgendered by my new counselor.	I've been doing counseling for a few months now. Switched to a new one today and despite my old counselor telling them I'm trans (and me bringing it today) I'm still misgendered. Probably gonna switch considering a lot of what I talk about is trans related and I get the impression they don't know much about trans issues.	"that’s a good idea, especially if they’re unwilling to work towards a better understanding of those issues.
Yep, definitely a red flag telling you to find a different therapist. Good on you for not settling for less than you deserve.
Hi, friendly local internet doctor here! (Nonbinary, they/them/she/her.)

A huge problem with medical care is that we have to go by medical records, most of which DO NOT allow for accurate or inclusive coding of gender. 99% of the time the only options are M and F, and sometimes you have to put in a support ticket and spend 30 minutes on the phone to change the gender between those two options. When we get a record, most of us don't read much except the basics; you're a shitty provider if you don't take your own unbiased history without undue influence from the record.

Of course, these miscommunications can be seriously horrible for patients -- but they're also almost ALWAYS correctable. I will never forget having taken a verbal history from a provider who misgendered the patient for the whole presentation. As I left the room, the provider's intern mentioned that the patient was a trans woman who went by XYZ. When I walked into that woman's room to assume care and just addressed her by her actual name and pronouns (her record was all Deadname this and he/him that) she literally started sobbing with relief.

I went back and educated the physician who had been misgendering her. She was mortified, and had not understood she was doing the wrong thing at all. She admitted that due to being a non-native English speaker, she could barely handle pronouns for cis folks and absolutely had no clue how to address a trans woman.

A couple years later I saw her working in our LGBT clinic and she was totally comfortable and confident in her care of trans patients. Her patients there loved her, and she cared deeply for them.

If you have addressed this with your clinician and they were still misgendering you then you NOPE NOPE NOPE out of there, but if you haven't already, I suggest you state something along the lines of, ""Hey, I'm actually a \_\_\_\_\_, though I was assigned \_\_\_\_\_ at birth. It upset me that you misgendered me because I have a lot of issues related to gender dysphoria. How comfortable do you feel working with trans patients?"" (Text or email if that's easier.) I don't think you should walk away from this feeling invalidated and rejected unless that is literally 100% what is happening and your therapist is a verified moron. You can't be set back in your journey in therapy just because of a miscommunication that went unaddressed, you know? This is your space to be heard and seen for who you really are -- don't relinquish it without at least speaking your mind.

Worst case scenario, if they turn out to be a USDA-certified dickhead, you tell them to fuck off then yell ""trans rights!"" and run away, okay? Doctor's orders :)
WTF!  That counselor is not on your side if they can't even address you properly.
Agree here. And to validate this further for you, ive had multiple clinicians do it to me. It serves no clinical purpose and only serves to erode the foundation from which all work must be done. For most professionals in the field it probably also violates their ethical codes related to respect for diversity and clients, as well as obligations to do no harm. 

You deserve better!"	thghj0	trans	75	0.95	2022-03-18 22:08:27
What was the first sign that you were trans?	"I got really self conscious of my chest in 4th grade and started wearing baggy clothing. I cut my hair because I was tired of brushing it. With the baggy clothes and short hair, I looked like a boy and substitutes and people I didn't know thought I was a boy and everyone else thought I was being misgendered but it felt so right to me to be called by he/him pronouns

I'm 16 now and have been out as trans for 4 years as of last month!"	"When I was 4 and wanted the girl boots, because ""I. WAS. A. GIRL!""

Spoiler alert it was 1984, I got the boy rain boots and a long time out and an explanation that I would always be a boy...  35 years later...  surprise!
First one I know of was at 3, being forced by my grandma to get a ""nice little boy haircut"" and absolutely HATING it.

First one I remember (and probably my first memory) was at 4.  I convinced someone to paint my nails.  My dad walks in, SCREAMS at me, and violently holds my arms down as the polish is removed.
Stealing my sister's one piece bathsuit at 12, to see what it would feel like to wear it.
(FTM) Found a puberty book when i was 5 that had drawings of male and female body parts and i remember crying over it cuz i didnt have the male ones lol
I was more comfortable being trans than I was being not trans.
Pretending to breastfeed a cardboard cutout of baby. I didn't have any dolls to use.
When I was twenty I dressed up as Elsa from Frozen (for a dare), and upon looking at myself in the mirror, I knew. I looked and felt *amazing*.
When I was at my moms friends house I played with the girl toys alot
the biggest thing I could remember was me as a little child dreaming about being a girl in a black dress with black nail polish on a weird little train. And that other dream where a girl painted my nails. Now here I am, wanting to be a tomboy. Not really into makeup tho
Generally getting along better with girls. Hating all of my body hair, being indifferent about stuff that made me masculine. Never caring how I looked but always being hyper aware of how I would style myself if I was a girl, that one took a lot of rationalizing, Feeling like I could express myself better if I was a girl. Stealing/modifying clothing. Been persistent through my whole life, only realized what it means now at 20.
I came home from preschool at almost four and was outraged that my mom dressed me wrong.
Getting to 11 or 12 and not having breasts
In retrospect, imagining a family of characters as a kid where the one I identified with was a girl. Wish I could remember her name, especially since I can remember some of the others.
Just constantly wishing almost throughout my whole life that I want to be a girl, and I still do, as I haven't officially came out yet to my family, because I'm scared of what they would think of me, since they're all kinda transphobic 😕
its so nice to see that so many folks figured it out so young but despite literally having estrogen under my tongue as im typing this im still getting a little bit of impostor syndrome

i guess id say when i was a kid and i had this odd thought about if i was a girl in a past life?

or maybe the times when i was a kid and found a 'girly' piece of media like a barbie movie or stuff like hannah montana that i really liked but made me feel almost like it was ""wrong"" to be enjoying it?

still took me forever to figure it out
When I was around 14 years old I had a soft voice but my dad yelled at me that I'm a man and need to stop to act like that, and also start using my mom's make up when I was home alone
When I was in the 3/4th grade my mom used to stay a few hours after school cuz she was in PTO or something whatever that is. Anyway, while I was there me and my friend snuck into the lost and found and we were looking at all the stuff and I found a “girly” long sleeve t shirt with pink horizontal stripes and I wore it around for like 5 minutes. Not a big deal at the time but the first time I ever did something trans related
When I was pretty young I would frequently have dreams in which I was a girl.
I just started hating manly things and started loving female ones.
Probably when I was 4 or 5 and went through a “phase” where I tried on my moms lipstick and got very curious about guys wearing dresses.
Oh there were tons of signs for me, I was just too blinded by the concept of what I was ""supposed"" to be yo see them. I was always into lesbian media and always played games as a female protag if I had the option. Since middle school really.
in elementary school I always felt more comfortable around the girls and couldn't really relate to the boys at all.
I'm FTM. When I was 4 years old my family decided that it was time to upgrade my tricycle to a bike with training wheels, and my grandfather and step grandmother volunteered to be the ones to buy it. I was at a park with my grandparents and my step grandmother asked me what color bike I was wanting. I looked over at some kids riding bikes and saw this boy riding on a shiny blue bike and it looked cool, so I told her that I wanted a blue bike. She told me that blue was a boy's bike color and shot me down. But I'll never forget thinking, ""but a blue bike feels right for me."" A couple of weeks later, my grandparents ""surprised"" me with a bright pink bike with polka-dots and streamers. I hated it, and felt so damn awkward and uncomfortable being seen riding around on it. I refused to leave our driveway with it because I was embarrassed to have my friends see me on it.
When I was 6 I told my mom that I wanted to be a pretty pink princess with absolute confidence and when I was told u couldn't, I cried.
Adapting a female persona online
I was about 3 and would play pretend, and id always be girl. I dont know why, i just always felt like one.
I honestly have no clue. It’s been a part of my life as long as I can think backwards. Maybe my absolute fascination with female protagonists in tv shows, movies and books?
When role-playing a doll house or any type of family house with my sister I always wanted to be the male animal/person/whatever we played with. Then we got the sims and it kind of continued :|
I don't really remember.. The furthest memories I had about that was when I was 14, I just thought ""I wish I was a girl"" often (At that time I didn't know about transidentity). Then I had a transmasc friend (he's name's Meredith) that teach me a lot about transidentity. And then I was like ""wait.. That's what I felt for 2 years""
I remember being in something like 1st grade. I learned the word “transgender” and immediately told my best friend that’s what I was. Years later I figured I was just being influenced by the things around me. Now I realize that I would literally wear my dads old clothes to school in kindergarten and tell my parents I was glad they gave me an easy name to make masculine.

I have no idea how they were so oblivious to it.

I also cut all my hair off and ask to shop in the men’s section because I wanted a suit. I mean, really, how?
Apparently at like 2 or so I wanted a pink wallet
First? I don't know. But around age 3. I was always found in the doll corner at school. I only really played with girls. At home I put a pillow below my shirt and pretended to be pregnant. And I told my mom I wanted to be a girl.
Whenever I went shopping with my friends or parents I would always gravitate towards the girl clothes and even have a fair bit of girl clothes
When I was young I despised getting my hair cut, I always wanted to play with the other girls but they weren't super into it most times, and even before kindergarten I dreamed as a girl.
Definitely wishing it was socially acceptable for men to wear feminine clothing and makeup and stuff. I still wish it was, but now I’m a girl. I’m not out, so I need to hide my skirt, but I feel so cute whenever I put it on.
I remember being about nine or ten, in the shower, looking at my legs and thinking for a moment that I would grow up to have legs ""like those ladies on TV"" but then quickly dismissing it because I 'remembered' I was a boy. This was the first of many moments but it was not particularly painful for me. I didn't discover myself through the pain of dysphoria, but rather found the pain of dysphoria once I came to terms with my gender.
I always secretly wanted a female body and to wear clothes that my female friends wore in elementary school. Hit really hard during puberty where I realized that I didn’t want that happening to me. Now drowning in my own thoughts
talked to myself in the mirror at age 3, mirror-me was a girl and told me it would be alright

somehow forgot about this for 30 years til i came out 🙄

once, i put makeup on my little sister because i knew better than to put it on me.  most of my ""signs"" were repressed lol
I knew I was a girl at 7
Goddamn I wish I knew when I was 12 lol I just figured it out when I was 16 almost exactly a year ago why I hated showers and swimming and having short hair and body hair etc. I knew trans ppl existed but I always had my preconceived notions on that (thanks society🙃) and then I saw bunny from spg and somehow it still took me a year after learning about trans ppl and interacting to see if maybe I liked being a girl. Soon as I came out to my few closest friends it hit me like a ton of bricks, just so much stuff clicked into place and my weird feelings towards certain things were like justified in a way. It’s an interesting path but I’m happy I went down it
I was about 3, and I wanted to paint my toenails pink with my mother and aunts.
There were signs forever. I wanted girl clothes ever since I was 9.
what was the first sign? Probably when I was a little kid and all the characters I would play pretend as were either ill defined in their gender or explicitly female lol. Whats the first sign I genuinely recognized as me being trans? My voice plummeting at age 16 and sending me into a psychological crisis that I'm still dealing with 🙃 I was a singer, so that awful.
[deleted]
I remember a lot of things. Some that made sense at the time and some that I only have put together recently.

When I was a kid I used to tell other kids I was actually a girl.

I remember getting sandals at a Walmart or something when I was very young. My parents wanted me to pick something out or we're picking something out for me. I saw these pink transparent ones in the girls bin. I knew not to say I wanted them.

I discovered masterbation by humping the corner of a desk by accident.

I masterbated the wrong way as a kid. Kind of knuckling where the top of the shaft meets the pelvis.

I used to do anything for clothing validation. Putting my legs through one pant leg. Makeshift clothes out of stuff like toilette paper. This one seems so sad and desperate. Still seems shameful for some reason... Not sure why this one is so hard to talk about.

I used to pray to a god that wasn't there begging to wake up a girl. I think I cried myself to sleep like that a few times or even a lot... But I have a hard time remembering.

My friends were girls for the most part for a long while. I even played with the neighborhood girls who were w couple years younger than me. I bet it looked kinda creepy :(

I stole my best friends' sisters' clothes. I just wore them in my room. Nothing sexual at the time. I never knew why I did it.

In fact I stole quite a bit of clothes. I'd try some of my mom's stuff on when no one was there too.

I never really put it together until the last year or two. I just did everything to hide it. I don't think I was ashamed, I was very accepting of anyones sexual stuff if it's consentual, but I viewed my crossdressing as a link.

I let a couple people take advantage of my desperation for a female role in a relationship. I let an older man steal my first kiss and a strange guy briefly have anal with me. The only time I ever kissed anyone and the only time I've ever tried having sex.

The thought of sex never worked. I thought I found women attractive but I had no programming on what to do. I realize now that was me confusing jealousy for attraction.

I wasn't attracted to men sexually but the thought of being in a submissive role or traditional feminine role sounded right. I couldn't imagine the relationship working... I definitely wasn't gay. Thankfully girl horny fixed that... I definitely like men but I'm super straight 😂

But I really craved some kind of intimacy. It's kinda sad thinking back about how I'd day dream about just laying on someone or getting a hug. Seeing people just having those things casually really hurt to see. Girls laying on each other platonically, friends hugging, etc.

I vaguely remember a girl giving me a hug in high school and I casually played it off and made my way to class like it was normal for me. I actually went to the bathroom and cried.

My parents didn't really show physical affection. I think it bothered my cis brother a lot too, whether he realized it or not. He found a lovely girlfriend, now his wife, and went from an incredibly angry person to happy over night  I never had that.

I remember my dad ripping off a necklace a friend gave me. He called me a punk. I remember my parents telling me that painting your nails was something only girls did when I took markers to my nails.

I remember making a few female characters in games like EverQuest. I didn't want anyone to know I made them though. I was also going and tried to make them look my age but there weren't any games that let you do that.

I also remember getting in trouble for trying to look up pictures of girls my age and getting grounded when my dad found out.

I don't remember when but at some point a fog set in. I just became detached. I grew a barrier that ablated my emotions and feelings. I idolized logical non-emotional characters like Vulcans or pretty much any of the planner archetypes in anime.

I recall mentioning to my brother once that it feels like I'm just watching myself live my life in 3rd person. Like it's a character In a game and that I feel detached from myself. He wisely said I should get help if I really felt that way. I wasn't really looking for help - I was looking for someone to just listen to me. I never reached out about that feeling again.

That haze lasted a long time. I remember a teacher talking to my parents about how detached and non emotional I was and that it was worrying. Maybe in middle school. I remember learning how to fake it. How to just say what people wanted to hear. I remember that same teacher telling them how nice it was to see me ""open up"" and watch my personality shine through. I remember thinking she was a moron.

I know my parents found my clothes once or twice. I know they had to have heard me crying at least a few times. I was born in the 90's so it was before being trans was even really a word or something anyone knew about. So I can't fault my parents for not getting me the care I needed - they could never have been prepared to support me.

They were good people and compared to everyone I knew they were amazing parents. My brother was a normal cis boy a year older than me and he turned out great and had a pretty idyllic life.

But it's hard to not resent my parents for some reason. It doesn't make sense but I can't shake it. Imagine if I got the help I needed a few days after picking out those pink sandals in Walmart as a toddler.

I made the password to one of my computers ""IAmTransgender1!"". Typing that every day slowly started to make it all settle into my brain. I was reading eggirl, articles on hormones, articles on srs...

HRT seemed so dangerous. I was thinking of buying pills online just to see how it felt or to feminize me a bit.

Without realizing it I had scheduled an appointment with a gender therapist to talk about getting an hrt letter. Then I found myself expediting it with Plume.

I started and still use injections. I started during quarantine and had no idea what I was doing. I had never used a needle before. Plume has terrible instructions and I didn't have anyone to show me or give me tips. Walgreens pharmacy gave me the wrong needles too. I used the same needle for drawing up and for injecting... And the gauge was just high enough to make drawing it up take forever and just small enough to be very unpleasant... But I still stabbed myself without hesitation lol.

My fear of hurting myself or of the pain was completely pushed aside by my desire to be anything but what I was.

I started hormones about 9 months ago and all my walls came crumbling down. It feels like I've missed my whole life. I'm 31. I've never had a significant other, I didn't go to prom, I've never done anything that girls treasure. I never even did any of the things guys treasure either.

It's getting better though. I'm a bit hopeful for the future. I'm getting vfs in a couple weeks. Ffs in March. I don't look too bad and hormones seem to be working.

I know I went off course there but it felt good to write it out and put my thoughts down. I hadn't thought about a lot of this stuff on a very long time. Most of it I forgot I knew. So thanks for making this thread.
In retrospect, probably the fact that when my sister and I were really young I used to dress up in her dresses.

(I think I would've been 5 or 6, and I actually don't remember it cos I have terrible long term memory of my childhood but I've been told about it and seen pics)
Wearing sports bras since the day I had to start wearing bras because I didn't want my chest to be visible. Also, when I got my first period my only thought was ""ew, why, I don't need this""
Also I was asexual, so that was part of it too.
Wanting boobs at age 6
when i was 4 and wondered if i was going to grow a penis
seeing a diagram of a penis for the first time in 4th grade sex ed and staring…..a bit too intently for a bit too long.
Thanks for triggering another crossdressing memory. One piece swimming suits felt so good
Ahh, the joy of euphoria-centered trans awakening
My best advice is to have a support system that accepts you outside of your family. Making a new family that loves you makes it all more manageable :)
This is kinda similar to where I’m at tbh. I honestly liked some more “girly” things growing up but I suppressed it and did other things because I was told I couldn’t like the more girly things. 100% relate to the “…feel almost like it was ‘wrong’ to be enjoying it.”

Now that’s coming back to bite me with imposter syndrome. I pushed what I liked so far down that I’ve started thinking maybe I didn’t like that stuff at all to begin with.
I started going by he/him pronouns online when I was 11 because I thought it was safer but I started to like it and felt comfortable being a guy. So I did the same thing but kind of flip flipped pronouns
Omg same. I was always the dad in ""house"" and it made my brothers mad because they couldn't play the dad. And in Sims I made myself a male sim
