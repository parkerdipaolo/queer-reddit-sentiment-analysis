Halloween costume this year confirmed
Thanks, I’m pretty attached to them ;)
Do it! I can’t believe how much I love it, and that I didn’t do it sooner. It’s a honey blonde with streaks of my natural brunette exposed, I think I’ll go lighter eventually, but one way or another I think I’ll be staying blonde for a long time!
Ugh I feel this. Hair can be so powerful, you know?
Thanks! I think all gauges are lovely but I’m keeping mine at 00, they’re easy to manage. I guess I do have a whole vibe going huh ;)
Thank you!!!
Right?! I’m never going back!
Oyé, beltalowda gotta make do
I’m not your fuckin brother, but my arms are hella thicc. I happen to really like them! You’re not gonna bring me down, even though that seems to be your thing since losing your production company after coming out. 

Maybe a therapist would be a better outlet for your personal problems than harassing strangers on the internet. My two cents. 

Peace and love.
Thank you!!
Looks so good, girl! I don't think blonde is for me but I already hear orange or pink calling my name. I'll have had 7 months of HRT by then and I plan on burning this man fat away so I'm eyeing Spider Gwen or Gwenom, I've always loved her costume. My wife could be lady Doc Ock and our son could be Spiderham!
yeah, I mostly gonna cave and take the platinum plunge before year's end... Wanna grow my hair out some more first, but after that most likely
So beautiful and a take no BS attitude....love it! A “10” in beauty and toughness...I admire you"	m8l0gn	trans	3450	0.98	2021-03-19 16:26:39
Feeling a lot of dysphoria after dealing with police	"Last night me (24 mtf) and my girlfriend (cis) got into a fight. Nothing physical or anything but due to a neighbor who strongly dislikes me and us yelling in front of him the police were called. The fight didn’t last long at all and we had made up but then the door was knocked on. I’ve never had any sort of trouble and never have even spoken to a police officer but I knew it had to be them. I went outside and spoke to the man. He was decently old and at first decently receptive. My girlfriend then came out and we both assured him we were fine and it was just a short yelling match. The officer then began to look at my girlfriend and ask if she was ok (he had not once asked how I was) and if she was hurt or feeling not safe. I knew then he had made me and realized I was a “guy” thus I had to of been abusing her. He demanded I go get my license and my girlfriend (who was ignorant of this) said she’d go get hers. He said no no he wanted “his” referring to me. I went inside in which the office again asked her if she was ok and safe. I came out gave my license then had to also give my social security number and then be placed away from my girlfriend so they could see if I had any warrants. My girlfriend sweetly told the officers to ask me if I was ok and if I was abused or feeling unsafe in which the cop said he didn’t need to do that. Eventually I was cleared and before they left they asked my girlfriend if she had a ride if she in fact had to leave at any point due to safety and she said she did. They then told her to call them if she needed anything then left. I have no issue in police making sure people are ok and separating us to ask in private if we’re ok is intelligent it just hurt me that apparently I wasn’t worth the same treatment. Sorry for the long text just wanted to vent my frustrations. Thanks for listening 

TL;DR policed were called on my and girlfriend and I and only she was treated with care and respect while I was kept at arms length of all involved"	"Had something very similar happen to my not-directly-neighbour actually with some variation. But instead of just assuring them she was okay, that girl defended the shit out of her girlfriend so loud I actually asked them the next day what was up (so they told me).

She apparently reported the officer for harassing her gf unprompted.
Yes they do that and it is horrible to experience. I’m sorry you went through that.
This is also why most cis men won't report abuse when it is inflicted upon them.  Many wind up being the ones taken to jail and the abuser knows that is what will happen, using it to manipulate them further.  

Yay for the gender bias in our society, in all its forms! /s
Did you get his name or badge number? Report him for discrimination and discriminatory actions against you. Hopefully he gets fired or karma removes him from the planet :) I can’t stand cops so much these days bc there’s to many bad eggs in the baskets.
This is why I will never call the cops for anything.
I went into the psych ward exhibiting all the signs of having been emotional battered and experiencing ptsd yet no one thought I was doing better until I started taking credit for my own trouble…. I was being emotionally abused daily


Should say 43yo mtf presenting as cis at the time
ACAB
Fuck, I'm so sorry that happened.

You might look up the laws in your area and see if you legally have to give any ID to a cop when you're in your own home in this situation. Driving is a different story but I've never heard of ID *and* SSN, especially with a house visit.
I'm so sorry. Even reading it makes me dysphoric
Sorry to hear you went through that, your neighbor sounds difficult too. 
It seems like we get the worst of gender discrimination from both sides of the gender spectrum and all sides of society. 
Maybe thats a reductive way to put it but it feels true. 

Hope you're feeling better soon.
That’s messed up, I’m sorry that happened to you.
Yup and that’s why I will stand by my fear/dislike of cops, I’m my home country they always seemed hostile and aggressive, I haven’t once felt safe near a police officer (thankfully haven’t had many run ins)
Its pretty sick that some cops will only worry about the people they read as female. Hope you're doing okay. Do some self care and I hope your gf is being there for you, sis. Dysphoria sucks
I'm so sorry about your experience. Reading it actually made me dysphoric because I know if this ever happens to me it'll probably go the same way. I'm sure your wife understands your feelings and I wish you love and hugs as well. ❤️
Well, there's a reason the police didn't get invited to our pride parade
I'd report his ass
What you should've done was asked for his warrant number/badge number and filed a report
ACAB.
Have a problem? Call the police. Now you have two problems... ACAB
Fuck the police. Now and forever.
Op heads up if your in the US then if cops show up ask if they have a warrant if they say no then you can legally shut the door in their face after saying “have a good morning/day/evening/night officers” still be polite about it and always record interactions
As a wise man once said 

Fuck the police
Thankfully I have never had that happen. But I constantly live in fear of cops for reasons just like this.
No thats really fucked up but not really surprising, and you shouldn’t let that stand, sorry that the ignorant officer made you feel that way☹️, but ooooh that pisses me off, he not only misgendered you (I assume) multiple times, profusely checked if your girlfriend was ok (which I understand why, and that abuse is too common that you should be careful, but assuming that because you are a “guy” that you immediately abuse her is ridiculous), and THEN when directly asked by your girlfriend if they should check on you, he said no? Fucking ridiculous and frankly misogynistic 😡😡
I'm so sorry 😞
Im sorry for this experience. Sadly a large amount of the police is garbage. No matter where you live. Hope you are feeling better meanwhile.
Sorry you had to go through that. I hope your doing okay x
I'm so sorry that happened. A lot of police just suck, with policing through ignorance, bias,  outdated training, full on crime . . . ugh.
That biased ignorant behavior from someone who is supposed to be protecting everyone . . . gross.

Long texts are so much better than short btw <3
Yeah most cops are transphobic from my and my close ones' experience. They are pretty horrible, don't let them drag you down.
This is a daily struggle for cis men. As a cis man I can say I feel for you because although you may be trans a lot of people are going to see you as a man no matter what. I’m not saying they’re right but I am saying that that’s a reality for anyone seen as male
It’s the police off shit like that would happen sadly. The police are dumb as hell their racist and treat shittly like that.
They are need to separate partners because in the possibly that one is actually being abused they maybe afraid to speak out in front of the officer.

You were still misgendered and that is awful, yes he should have asked both of you privately (I believe cis men should be asked in private too for their safety, abuse goes both ways) I'm so sorry this happened and I hope you and your girlfriend don't get in anymore fights.

Take care of eachother please and don't forget to take care of yourself.
ACAB all the way. They're evil by nature.
I’m not an adult yet so I haven’t had a chance to go through this, but you have my sympathy. Honestly police need to learn to respect people and treat all suspects equally and fairly. The whole sex bias thing is messed up, and they should have also questioned that shmuck who called the police on you.
that would be so infuriating im mad just hearing it. I would’ve punched that cop tbh
Never open the door to the police. Call 911 and talk to them. Explain someone is trespassing and you want them to leave. Explain the TV / Video game may have gotten loud during an action scene.  The police were doing their due diligence. You can never forgive yourself returning to the same address and finding a dead spouse.
ACAB
I don't think I'd be sweetly anything if they did this in front of me. 

NOT that I think you're gf was wrong or anything! I just mean that I am a special kind of ""can't shut me the fuck up"" kind of voice. I'm not a quiet person by any means when I'm upset, & this would've pissed me the fuck off. 🤬
Wow who would have thought the pigs would be transphobic and do their jobs poorly…
Disgusting pigs. Sorry you had to deal with that.
Fuck 12, what an asshole. Sorry you went through that.
What a good girlfriend im glad she stood up
❤️
Exactly this. I can’t believe they wouldn’t get a confirmation of both of us being ok. It’s terrible having to deal with such nonsense and it breaks my heart thinking about all those in my shoes who actually were abused and ignored or not even asked because of guy
Exactly this also
Fuck gender norms. I’m a rock now
AMAB and masc presenting at the time (before I realized I was enby) Yeah no. I got physically and mentally abused. You gotta suck it up. It's the reason I have trust issues.
If this is the US, reports don't work. That's like writing a complaint about your boss then giving it directly to him
the only time i had to use that ""service"", iv grown to despise them even more than i already did before.

so anyhow... this is why i always carry a knife with me...
That's messed up. Hopefully you are in a better place now.
Those assigned cop at birth are all bastards
All cats are beautiful?
This systemic crap is EXACTLY why we say things like this. The law enforcement community, as a whole, is deplorable. Police are corrupt, lazy, racist, sexist, abusive, discriminatory, a disproportionate number of cops are themselves violent criminals, and the ""good ones"" can't both fight that reality and keep their job. ACAB indeed, they're even worse than that.
I’ll definitely look into it yeah i figured it may be normal I have no experience in it but will definitely check to know for certain
Unfortunately you do have to provide ID in this situation. In some states when cops get called to a domestic complaint they are required by law to take a report even if an arrest is not made. If you don’t ID yourself you can be taken in for obstruction. Bummer. Also because it’s a domestic complaint they were probably also checking to see if an order of protection was in place.
Thank you ❤️
Thank you and I hope you don’t have to ever feel such ways
Warrant is only needed for searches and arrests under certain circumstances. No one was arrested and no premises was searched = no warrant. I spent to much time working in courts. It got depressing.
That could be taken too ways. Kinky.
I worked in family court for too long. Very depressing place often. Unfortunately “Do you have a warrant” aren’t magic words that make them go away during a domestic investigation. It sucks being investigated like that. Nosy neighbors.
I wish we could rely on the police to make sure we're safe sadly we cannot as they allow themselves to fall victim to prejudice (a good amount of the time there's definitely a few Good ones but that doesn't make up for the fault's of the rest)
I agree I just hate that it’s a thing to deal with for men and trans people alike.
I think it’s great they separate to ask questions and such but yeah I believe both parties should always be addressed. Innocent until proven guilty and such. I appreciate your words and will take care
When I was in basic training I had a short latina drill instructor. One day her assistant was in charge of us. Apparently the night before she was arrested for beating up her husband.
I had my ex make a false report to child protective services in Florida on me when my son was in the hospital for a nasty flu. Sheriff Deputy shows up with another officer to my sons room while we waited for his discharge papers to confront me. Took me to a corner of the hospital floor, and questioned me like I was a dangerous abusive person and all the while the uniformed officer ( both were female) had HER HAND ON HER GUN WITH THE STRAP UNDONE THE ENTIRE TIME. This was infront off my kids and wife and the whole hospital staff and other families with small children. They had my wife and kids questioned while I was out and were pressing them to say I was abusive to them all. (My wife is a Bronx raised Puerto Rican gen X’er. She would spatter me if I ever laid a finger on her or the kids so the insinuation was laughable to her)

It was a false report and was dropped after weeks of harassment and my ex admitting it was false. The cops treat anyone seen as male like a violent criminal even if no crime has been committed. It is humiliating.

( i had the kids with my ex, my second wife was at the hospital with me and we have full custody of the kids together)
yeah its really shitty one of the things im not looking forwards to as a trans man
Trust me darlin, it sucks immensely. I’m very sorry that it went the way it did. My first wife was an abusive narcissistic b!tch, verbally, emotionally, and on rare occasions physically. It never got reported because I was a big “guy”, I should be able to handle any situation with a little ol’ woman. She now REGULARLY tells the world that I was the abusive one. I only fought back when I had had all I could take of her emotional bullying, and would then be shut down with the threat of loss of my daughters. She took my daughters away from me anyway when she divorced me 20 years ago, to be with my cousin. It royally sucks. Good luck with your neighbor.
It needs to be reported at a federal level cause any police department will always come back with a investigation saying otherwise https://civilrights.justice.gov/
This depends on the city. I have had my own interactions with the police department in my own city. 

Ever trans person has to realize that like it or not they have to be an activist
Yeah, it went a while longer after the hospital, not being abused now and getting on track to start transitioning.  Much better :)
TACABAAB
Honestly I read ACAB in the same way I read AMAB/AFAB *every damn time*
Take an updoot
A Cool Ass Bus
the only good interaction iv had with the police was when i interacted with my moms ex-coworker.

the other time, i literally got robbed, had to find everything myself, go there THRICE, and after all of that they hold my phone hostage FOR HALF A YEAR, all while me worrying that iv lost one of my most prized possessions (that being my steam) that iv spend even more money on than my pc, and when i got the phone, they've factory reset it so i couldn't even get in for like 3 hours.
I mean it also sounds like he was trying to find a reason just to make an arrest, then theres the blatent misgendering, so Id defs send a letter off at a federal level about this.
If you’re in the US you probably have to. They have probable cause since the neighbor called so they were detaining you
A warrant number is just the UK equivalent of a  badge number
It can help sometimes
I am so sorry for your loss. I hope one day those who matter will see the truth
my head didn't even connect the cop bits so i just assumed it meantAssigned Cool At Birth...

sorry guys I'm just a bit of a genius /j
if you know tumblr lore, that's the Down With Cis Bus
The cop asked for a SSN because if the OP didn't sound like they credibly had one, that cop was probably going to call ICE.
Interesting.
Sure but it depends on the situation. They know when they need one but, mwah ha ha ha 😈, they sure aren’t going to tell you lol.
Thank you. My oldest might, one of these days, but I doubt it. We lost my youngest to domestic violence 10 years ago. She was 20 years old. She died hating me and believing her mother. That’s even harder to take, than her loss, to be completely honest.
Yeah, it wouldnt surprise me tbh. Cops are pretty trashy tbh. They always seem to look for a problem, if they cant find one, they find a way to make one.
And police a legally obliged to give it to you if you ask they're also obliged to tell you their rank and name
When folks pass over I believe they lose their earthly limiting beliefs and come to understand everything and just feel love and peace, so from that perspective I would say that now your daughter will understand and love you. I hope that helps. I wasn't spiritual like this until I lost my dad
That's why you don't talk to cops. The problem you think you have may not be the problem you actually have. It's kinda like dealing with the Fae. The less said, the better.
That is also true in the US. In my interactions they usually introduce themselves by name anyway. Nice no to have to say hey you there.
Thank you hon, sincerely. That thought hit me fairly strongly in the “feels” department. I’m having a bit of difficulty seeing through the tears brought on by your simple kindness. Kindness isn’t expressed nearly often enough these days. I miss her every single day, even after 10 years. You get use to the pain after a while, but it never really goes away. 

Thank you,

Robin
Oh for sure. I mean its also in the miranda rights. ""Anything you say can and will be used against you in a court of law.""
UK they dont unless they're detectives
Aw you're so welcome. Grief is such a wild ride, and we totally don't have the knowledge and rituals to do it properly. But stuff like this really helped me. 

I came out as trans the year after my dad passed, and felt so sad that he didn't know this about me, so i was advised to write him a letter telling him. And I did. And a few days later I wrote a letter from his perspective, back to me, trying to channel his voice, telling me he loved me and was proud. And I wrote to him again. Back and forth for a few months. That helped give me a strong sense of his presence in my new life.

It sounds like you're a bit stuck in your grief still, and that creating a bit more space to grieve might be helpful. Do you have an alter for her in your house? Could be a tiny shelf with a picture of her, and a few things she liked. Somewhere you could put a letter if you wrote one, or you could sit there and talk to her.

Sending hugs
Don’t give their name?
They don't introduce themselves by name
That seems odd for anyone police or otherwise. It happens in the US but it’s usually a grumpy one. Some won’t even acknowledge a hello. I’m the type that might have fun with this. You could give them all funny names. Just let them know what names they have been assigned so they don’t get confused.
I'd just say you're PC plod and you're PC plumb
Perfect. You have the idea. Could say PC Clod. Steven universe reference. https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=MaleS9L8crM

Got deadnamed in front of all my coworkers by the new night manager. I was talked down to like a child and was treated like I was overreacting for being upset.	"So I work at Wal-Mart and I'm stealth FTM, I've been on testosterone for almost 2 years, I don't get misgendered and no one knows I'm trans and i prefer to keep it that way for safety reasons. Well, last night I went in to work and during roll call everyone got called leaving me unmentioned and my deadname that no one heard before. You can probably guess they'd put two and two together.
   I had a terrible panic attack, my managers know that is my dead name and my preferred name is on everything. This night manager knows my preferred name and insisted on repeating my deadname while I stayed completely silent and frozen. 
   I expressed my anger and why that was dangerous and wrong and he scolded me like a child saying ""how was I supposed to know?"" And playing it off and had the nerve to tell me ""hey, don't use that language with me okay?"" And when I was too upset to ask he repreated himself wanting a verbal ""Yes"" from me. 
   I don't want to go back to work, I feel absolutely humiliated.
   To make matters worse this guy knows I'm autistic and makes it his goal to trigger me. I have no one to go to and no one cares. 
   I'm done.

EDIT: I wanted to day thank you for all the advice. To be honest I fully expected this post to go unnoticed so I'm really surprised and thankful for the support. I'm going to just start looking for a new job to be honest. I'm not good with confrontation and I'm too emotionally exhausted with other factors to make a big stink about it.
Adding to that I'm homeless and can't exactly get a lawyer or anything to sue like some suggested. I think I'm just going to look for new employment, bide my time at walmart until I get the new job, and continue the good fight. Thank you"	"Ok if you have to keep the job, there’s a couple things you should do

1. Take notes. Diligently. Dates/shifts and exactly what happened and what your manager said
2. Go to a higher up, store manager, district manager, as high as you have to go. 
3. Be clear when you go to the higher up that this person is discriminating against you and that you will keep going higher up until someone takes action.
4. Request to never be placed on the same shift as this manager.
5. Look for a local civil rights group and get some Allies that can help you legally protect yourself

Sorry you’re going through this and I hope you can resolve this

Sending ❤️ your way
Former Walmart employee here. Open door policy that shit immediately. There should be a number posted in the break room if you don't trust your gm. I'm so sorry that happened to you. What that manager did was unacceptable and they should be held accountable. Walmart, fortunately, has policies in place to help you in situations like this. Please use them. 
All the love ~ Zara
I also work at Walmart and you can open door that. A situation like that sucks and there is NO reason why a team lead or member of management should be treating you like that after their mistake. I've been working here for 3 years but have only been out for the last 6 months and I literally just had my store manager deadname me the day of our first Black Friday event and he didn't realize it immediately. Then about 5 minutes later he gave me a pat on the shoulder and apologized profusely for it. This goes for all members of management if they deadname me or get my pronouns wrong (doesn't happen often) they admit their mistake and we move on.
In this economy, finding a new job should be easy for him, so if there were any witnesses, I’d sue for discrimination if it’s persistent.
Never respond to someone who calls you by your deadname. Just completely ignore it, act like you have no idea who that is. Dont give in!
Listen, everyone else already gave you baller advice so I just want you to know your anger is 100% valid. We get gaslit all the time as trans men and women and when we get upset, we get made to feel like we’re the unreasonable ones. Absolutely forget that crap. I hope this manager gets in trouble for this and I hope you and your child do okay this winter. Love to you both 💖
Fuck Walmart. Try to find a new job. Don’t even give them a notice.
r/antiwork might be a good place to go for legal advice if you want to take that route, but people in this thread are giving pretty good advice that i encourage you to take, especially taking notes up to someone that manages him. you do not deserve to be treated this way, im sorry that this happened to you
i’ll really sorry this happened to you. wishing you gxdspeed as you power through the winter. i come from walmart country, lots of us have worked for that monster. do what you need to do and protect yourself at all costs 💝
Aww man, I can’t even imagine. As someone who is autistic also, I don’t even understand why ppl do stuff like that intentionally. So sorry you had to go through that.
I believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/qw4q8f/did_you_know_trans_people_have_workplace/) is a response to your post. Good tips and links.
When you find a new job, don't give a God damn two week notice
Document Everything that has happened so far, Then continue to document as things proceed.  Dates, Times and People involved (people present) are important. Report this to Human Resources.    Even if you are finding a new job it is best to get this incident on the books.  At the bare minimum if might prevent it from happening again (maybe even to someone else).  You might even be identifying a Transphobe that the company did not know was present.
Report him
Go straight to a lawyer,  do not pass go,  collect bucks!   That’s horrible….so sorry it happened to you but you certainly have recourse.   Find a new job in the meantime,  you’re valid and deserve much better!
Wal-Mart. Why am I not surprised.
I’m a manager at Walmart.  I’ve had problems with being misgendered from employees.  Call ethics if the store manager doesn’t take care of it.  It might take a while for them to do anything but ethics will take it seriously and take care of it.
What job does role call? Mine we just punch in and out. I know during school If I had a sub I’d tell them my preferred name, then what it says on the role call and that I’m here
Hell I'd contact HR if you have one.

And the other management.
Go to hr..
The deadname is horrible. I'm going to go at this from a different/additional angle though.

Being autistic and having this manager purposely trigger you is a real issue.  If you're in the US he is likely breaking laws around that. (In addition to being a total d-bag.) That issue needs to be brought up with HR and reported to the state.

He's creating a hostile work environment for multiple groups of people. I'm certain if that comes to light he'll be spending time with an HR rep of he isn't outright fired for putting the store and company at risk.
Yea, Walmart and Amazon are two corporations to stay away from. Unhappy bitter people take command and don't care about human rights. To then you're a pawn that's replaceable.
You can reach out the ACLU for assistance with legal action.
wdym safety reasons?
Lmk if you think I should take him on a nice trip 👍
OP, Ik you said you don't have the money (Or energy) to get into a full-on war over this but most of the time, even the threat of legal action gets people moving.  
""Do I need to contact higher ups about discrimination in the work place?"" or the like since NOBODY wants their job threatened unless they REALLY dislike their job.
Report this to HR or your personnel staffer (who is technically above even the store manager though only for oversight purposes). As a former “Coach” (ASM) this is completely unacceptable behavior and constitutes harassment. Especially if they aren’t showing respect after you explained to them why that isn’t what you want to be called! If I was working there I would have recommended we put them on leave for a day to retake personnel management training cbls. This is a bad look for the store and company and just an overall shitty thing for a “leader” and “role model” to do. Sorry this happened to you :(
I work at walmart and can assure you that you need to report this to ethics. Im kinda stealth rn as well and get alot of flak but if they do this intentionally you need to report it to your store manager or lead and if the issue persists then call ethics and open door them. Walmart might be a shitty place to work especially overnights but for a manager to do this is considered transphobia and is against the companies policy. 

In short, report them and make it known that he is aware of what he is doing; as management is supposed to be trained on dealing with people like us including names and actions. 

If your store is aware of your condition regarding autism i also highly recommend you report them for abuse with a social worker or other third party as it will help stop this abuse and you might compensated for workplace abuse.
""Negligent infliction of emotional distress"" (NEID) is a personal injury law concept that arises when one person (the defendant) acts so carelessly that he or she must compensate the injured person (the plaintiff) for resulting mental or emotional injury. 

Talk to an attorney about this. One might be able to take you on contingency (pay nothing unless you win.) side note: this is not legal advice
I'd say you got it bent. I get it. That shit hurts, no doubt.what though. You ain't never been hurt before are humiliated.? What I thought. Take your butt right back in to that store and work just as hard as you always do and tell that asshole good morning and good night every day. BUT...... From now on you carry a small little recorder and every time some one treats you bad record that ass and post it rvru3here you can think to do so. Bet hisq don't know he or she act like that.  Make them 2ant to hide. You Rick and that it from me...Peace..out
Im so sorry man, you didn't deserve that. Sending love 💗
Get somebody pro Bono. There's so many people that want to help others that would take an easy case like this.
I'm so sorry this happened. He's an ass and you were well within your rights to be upset with him.
sorry that happened to you.  Sure sounds like there was an element of intention to dehumanize you.  Good luck to you, don't give up.  You matter.
This post feels like it could fit into the antiwork sub, not saying you should post there. But it definitely has the same vibe as other stories where the managers are completely disrespectful and lack any kind of compassion. I wouldn't doubt transphobia could play a role but these kinds of bosses also love making anyone that works for the feel small and miserable and sometimes it feels like they don't even need a reason.
I’d try brink in a wire that records sound and record things he says and does and also you can report to the police on harassment if he’s triggering autism on purpose and if possible show them security footage if it has sound even better
That’s so fucked. I’m so sorry you had to deal with that. I would totally go to HR about that. If you have it set up that your preferred name is on everything and they still purposely called out your dead name that’s definitely worth going to HR.
Complain to hr if there is one, idk if Walmart does. If your real name is on everything then he would have had no reason to deadname you than to piss you off. I would also suggest to just not respond to your deadname no matter how much he insists on using it. He’ll cave in eventually. It only depends on who has more determination and you definitely have him beat there no doubt.
Also, if I Canada, note that this sort of thing was recently ruled a human rights violation. Manager could absolutely have the book thrown at him if you can document a recurring issue with this.
Awesome advice. I just want to piggy back and say do these things even if you don't want/need the job anymore. Especially taking notes. Also, journal it out, for your own mental sanity too. <3
Yep! It’s a really similar approach to union worker stuff. Be diligent, write things down, and make sure that you don’t let shit slide.
Totally agreed, and also former employee here.  I had a situation that I reported on the hotline and it was dealt with within several days.  Corporate HR doesn't seem to leave a lot of wiggle room for harassment reported through open door.
That’s reassuring to hear ‘cause I work at Walmart, but I’m as closeted as I can be for the next ~30 days, then I’m starting hormones. Good to know that the managers will have my back, at least
I'm homeless living with my friends until winter is over and then I have to find my own place. I'm also a single parent with no car, so I have to he able to support my daughter and afford to go to and from work with uber. I pay my phone bill and rent every month. I have no choice. Jobs are hard to come by and I can't risk losing this one.
No don't fuck Walmart. You sue that ass for hostile work environment. And did you know that Walmart has stores all over the world. Go see some places on their dime ....uuuummmm. Transfer anyone
And if that doesn’t work go into gay and lesbian bars and write his phone number and name on all the bathroom stalls in marker .
Each of us had our name called and was assigned a department
I work with folk who are homophobic/transphobic
Please don’t work hard when selling your labor for an hourly wage. You get paid the same either way, and it just increases expectations for the entire workforce and makes for an unhealthy work environment where people who work at a casual pace are belittled and judged. Even if you’re working hard they are still going to pay you the least that they possibly can. Working hard in retail doesn’t improve your potential earnings or career path it just makes you a sucker, and increases your and everyone else’s workload for absolutely no benefit to the workers.
Oh man that's a dangerous mix. Recording abuse on the sly can be hella illegal depending on where you are. Also working harder or even as hard isn't always possible when anxiety is in the mix. When you are struggling to just function just going back into that environment is a test of strength in itself.
No they don't. Corporate hr takes all open door policy reports very seriously. Rightfully so too, it's what keeps them from getting sued a lot. Better to fire a hateful person than pay out a discrimination settlement. Corporate will 100% be on OP's side.
Yeah, I hear in certain places some managers will be assholes anyway but you can always open door it. Company policy ALWAYS has your side in a situation like that.
Find a new job before you quit this one, for sure. Finding a job within walking distance of home might be difficult so you do whatever you gotta do to be safe with you and your kid.
[Another person posted this on the thread and just wanted to make sure you see. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/qvxyll/got_deadnamed_in_front_of_all_my_coworkers_by_the/hkzar70/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
Sue? Lmao how much is a lawyer again…?
I mean I wouldt say it makes you a sucker but there isn't really any reason to work ""hard"" in retail or fast food. Go to work, do the minimum and get your money, because they will always find a reason to not give you a raise. And now that places are desperate to hire, the bar for the minimum is lowered even more. I honestly don't blame anyone who buys into the ""you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and start at the bottom and go up to the top"" mantra because it's repeated so often in our culture
For things like human rights violations or civil lawsuits you can usually get a lawyer for free initially so long as you have a winnable case. Then they just take a percentage of the payout once a judgement has been placed. It’s still kinda scummy as they usually take a substantial percentage of the payout, but that’s capitalism.
Attorney for this would be free, if they take the case... for a cut of the settlement.
Good to know, thanks! /genuine
Alternative there are also lawyers that operate pro bono.
Of course! Always glad to share some unsourced information from the back of my brain. 🙂
Tell me more about this? Where does their money come from?
I don’t know, I have never needed a lawyer. (so far)

I am just offering what I know about lawyers for people with low income. (I don’t know much obviously.)"	qvxyll	trans	1719	0.99	2021-11-17 12:12:18

Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up 💜
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn’t have to be your blood!
Exactly what I’m a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I’m so sorry you had to go through all that. I don’t know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you’ve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn’t have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don’t have cell service. 

It’s hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you’re okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ☹️ but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well 😊 stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents “loved” the latter.
I’m so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ❤️
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter… I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them… right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don’t deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case…

Take what you’ve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened… get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story. Because you may need to take legal action (saw that you were waiting for that ‘one more thing’ these people sound quite capable of continuing.
<hugs> ❤️
I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some 💕
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It’s been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I’m so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I’m worse off financially, too, but I’ve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ❤️
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I’m very proud of you 💜👍
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I’m so sorry. I’m glad that you’re ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I’m not sure where you are located but I’m pretty sure if you’re 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I’m not saying press charges or anything either, that’s something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I’m glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I’m so sorry for you😭😭😭

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourself💜, for how you’re dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with “those rascals, I’m not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I’m not happy with what they’ve done”. Ik it’s family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can’t withhold someone’s medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn’t be brushed off. I’m guilty of doing this as well with the whole “one more thing, that’ll be my breaking point” but then things calm down and the next thing doesn’t quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn’t be split up and sent to equally abusive “fathers” ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there’s nuance but op if there isn’t anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice…

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1211	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51

being trans while being poor, in a catholic household, in a muslim country isnt helping my mental health	"i can just hold on for another 5 years till i get the job i want and be able to start medically and socially transitioning, but i was already suicidal before. i dont trust myself to not implode from dysphoria and stress before im able to live as myself.

realizing im trans already broke one of my internal safety switch. the rest might go off, i might relapse back into fantasizing about suicide. im finally feeling that immense gender dysphoria and i dont like it a single bit.

its really hard to find a therapist or anyone at all, i dont live anywhere close to the ones others told me about. and im shitting my pants from the thought of anyone that i know at all knowing that im trans. 

idk maybe im expecting for help, maybe i want the easy way out. ive been distracting myself but its starting to creep into my distractions. 

i just want my feelings to be heard i guess. a part of me wants someone i know to see this. id most likely would deny it anyways so theres no point. 

honestly theres no point in this post now that i think about it.

edit: i honestly didnt expect this many responses. i dont really know how to respond to all the kind messages and put them into words. thank you, truly.

so far im still holding on, i really hope i wont need to feel that dread of suicide anymore."	"i think there is a point to this post

even if it doesn’t lead to much external help, at least you’re talking about it, rather than letting it all build up inside you

if you ever wanna talk, my DMs are open

or contact me on discord: EstiQT#0382 :)
good lord im so sorry youve been born in such shitty situations to be trans in. please stay here anon because once you do get the job youll feel so much safer and better. it seems like its an uphill battle but i wish you best in finding a therapist or someone who can help you more than I can
I'm a """"""muslim"""""" in a muslim household in a muslim country. can relate to the whole experience. I prefer to think of it as my current existence akin to the truman show except im in on the whole show thing. I just need to get another job since this current acting gig just isnt my thing you know ;)

repackaging the stress is nothing more than a coping mechanism, but if it works, it works ya know?
I know the exact feeling. I'm 21, transfem, and living in a house of 6 Pentecostal christians who completely disregard me even after coming out; while also trudging through poverty and debt. 

I don't have a car, so I rely on them; but they refuse to take me to my hormone appointments because they think it's self harm. ""It'd be like buying the razors you'd use to cut yourself"" they said.

And despite being out, theyve never once used my pronouns or name. 

Just, I know the feeling so so well. If you need someone to empathize with you, my DMs are open

Edit: if you prefer discord or anything other than Reddit, lmk and I'll give my info mkay?

Oh god i thought i was the only one. I can relate to this so much. Reading your post was like seeing myself, it’s scary that it’s so relatable. I don’t how to help you, i don’t even know why i wrote this pointless comment. Stay alive and safe, don’t give up on your dreams.
❤❤❤
Jesus how can you still alive. Like being apostate is already hard enough.
As a trans woman from a Muslim family, and also having lived in very conservative places, I feel you. And to be brutally honest with you, you will need your independence to be yourself, whether it's another country or simply moving out. But that does not mean there aren't ways to cope with it until that time comes. There are lots of ways to do things incognito to help you cope with it a bit better. And you can always DM me and talk to me, even if just to vent :) and I don't know about the job you ""want"", but if you are able to get A JOB that will allow you independence, it's worth getting that than living 5 years torturing yourself, and potentially self-harming.
i hate to see people struggle like this while being trans. i can relate somewhat, but only in my past. i grew up being very uneducated on the subject so i was really paranoid abt these things. only reasons i don't relate is because i grew up in america in what i didnt know was a lgbtq+ safe household until i was 17. i barely survived the stress of it, i can only imagine your struggle. regardless, you're far stronger than i'll ever be. very, very very much love to you💙
This way of being a person who was born as male and who feels as female is hard. It takes many years to become yourself, and nobody will feel sorry for you in this world. Humble yourself!

Yeah. Our childhoods were different. Yeah, a lot of us have not experienced some of the things cis girls do. But, no, I was not privileged to be forced to align with patriarchal manhood for my own safety. In fact, I was violated on a deep level. Denied my own reality and sense of self, or self worth, or humanity, or safety. So, no, I did not experience male privilege. I experienced survival.

Simplified simile - you wouldn't tell a person who hates golf that they're so lucky to be forced to play golf every weekend because it's a prestigious sport."	"This 1000%. TERFs are absolutely ridiculous. I hate when they try to include me as a trans masculine person in their feminism but exclude trans women. It's ridiculous. I don't want to be included in their feminism; I'm not a woman. Trans women deserve to be included in and even be at the forefront of feminism
Exactly this..besides getting beaten up by men for being ""gay"" and treated like some sort of ""pathetic, weak excuse for a man"" by ex's...... What fucking privilege is that?
So much love for my sisters. I'm so sorry for all of the traumatic shit you endured because of our broken ass society as well as the internal struggles that come with being trans.  The world can be a deeply cruel place and I hope your words reach those who need to hear them.
THIS plus for some reason my english teacher who tries to seem all accepting and woke always points out my ""female socialisation"" in front of the whole class, to some of the students I'm trying to be stealth, I trusted him but now I realise he's just a fucking dickhead and terf
Okay, as a psychology graduate, writer, and medical student, this article seriously impressed me intellectually and resonated with me emotionally because that was my experience too. People say “you must have enjoyed your male privilege” prior to fully embracing my true identity as a female. No. I didn’t enjoy it. I didn’t want it. Did I experience passive benefits of being perceived as a male? Yes, of course I did. I won’t hide that. But I didn’t want it. I *don’t* want it. I was just a scared girl living under the mask and persona of masculinity and male identity to survive an emotionally abusive and malignant home environment - and that was *while* I was living as a boy to hide my true female self from further harm, which would have suffered far worse at the hands of my home and society.
This. Being forced to suppress who you are to avoid being mistreated is never a fucking privilege that is literally a form of oppression. It's also reaaalll ironic and hypocritical how TERFs will spout shit about how historical trans men ""were actually brave feminist women who tragically had no choice but to pretend to be men to achieve their goals"" yet when a trans woman is forced to suppress herself and has her womanhood denied to her from birth and has to pretend to be a man to avoid abuse and oppression suddenly she's the fucking villain with ""male socialization"" and ""male privilege"".
> you wouldn't tell a

I can’t stress how true this is…
I have never seen the privilege of being a man, all i had see is other bullying me, not feeling at my place and hating the ""other"" man for what they do to me
I mean, I probably won't be taken nearly as seriously after transition. I'd say I *did* experience male privilege, the experience was simply different than that of a cis guy. But while many people use it maliciously, there *is* value in discussing this. Like, take Caitlyn Jenner: it's hard to argue her experience weren't shaped by many years living in boy mode.

I mean, people who wanted to play tennis but were forced to play golf for a bit will have a different outlook on sports than people who played tennis their whole life. Right?
This essay is incredible. Easily the most well-articulated argument I've seen on the subjects it addresses. It made me rethink many of my own biases, and the directness was incredibly refreshing since I am one of those generally unhappy people who read too much theory. 

I'm so glad she addresses the recent infighting between trans masc/fem people online because it's really been pissing me off lately. She calls out the right groups while being respectful to all parties involved. As a trans masc person, I highly urge others to read this and to get it in their heads that it is essential for us to actively support trans women/femmes and their lived experiences while acknowledging our own intersectional privilegeges.
I agree somewhat but when people thought I was a straight white man I was never afraid of going out alone at night. Never really afraid of being sexually assaulted or discriminated against. I was really blind to a lot of things that others experienced. Privilege may be the wrong word and TERFs are horrible people but it would be dishonest for me to pretend I didn't have it easier than cis women. Not saying it was easy to live a lie and the dysphoria is still painful but as a father of three wonderful daughters I know my childhood was easier than theirs. But that is my personal experience and I am in no way downplaying your experience OP.
I hated myself so much for my urges. Whenever I gave in and wore girls clothes or watched gay porn I would cry afterwards. I felt like less of a human because of what I wanted. My biggest fear was that it would be exposed. I was terrified of my friends and family finding out who I am. I dont know if I was priviledged, but I certainly didnt feel priviledged.

Back then I chatted a lot with litteral pedophiles, because that was the only option of expressing myself I was comfortable with. I risked being raped or kidnaped, just because I was terrified of my environment. Because I had noone. I felt so alone.
I wouldn’t call it privilege.. but there are certain things you experience differently if you do present as a man or more masculine. That’s just part of the patriarchy, unfortunately.
This is so true
I was socially outcasted by the ""chad"" males. It's like they somehow knew I wasn't a bro like they could just sense it so they wouldn't let me into the guild of the dong lol I was literally just an alien, no social sex group to fit in with. Now thanks to me not having a dick anymore because that 1980s TERFism really messed up modern women in the head, and society working to go away from that, I'm starting to make friends with cis women :) and of course now us trans girls are more of a thing so we always have each other but no one was out when I was a kid, we didn't even know what a clitoris was forget being trans
I actually disagree completely. Spending all that time learning how to leverage white male privilege has 100% informed my decisions and attitudes as a woman.

That being said, a dog whistle is still a dog whistle, but there's no reason to engage that type of thing.
No I do not think y’all had male privilege, specifically because of the stories transfems have TOLD me. Anyone who disagrees lives in a fantasy. Especially when if you’re effeminate as a kid, you get called “not a man.” On top of that my little sister is transfem, and I remember my stepdad saying that “you act like a little girl man up” crap to her and honestly I think about it a whole lot.
One of my partners is the patron that supplied the prompt for that piece
Thank you for sharing this! It put into words a lot of things that I haven't had the vocabulary and the energy to analyze.
Got to play lacrosse, and wasn’t pushed away from aviation, video games, or cool military shit (the military sucks but the tech is neat).

That’s literally it for things I like about how I grew up. All the “advantages” just mean I don’t know what I’m doing NOW
Okay, what the fuck is this?! I’ve read only a tiny bit and it’s ridiculous! It’s like they’re trying to put on a show!

Edit: okay, I see where this is going. 

Rant: WE WENT THROUGH HELL. Not our suxualtites (actually maybe as well) but OUR GENDER. we had to PRETEND to be a Guy for our own safety! WHY? BECAUSE PEOPLE LIKE THEM make it that way! Gender roles are constructs by society. Sure, women are allowed to wear anything they want, but guys? NOPE! Still not acceptable for a guy to wear a dress. A girl can wear a skirt and shorts, but a guy can only wear shorts. We are not ENJOYING the benifits of being a guy, we are trying to escape it! God these people are idiots, I can’t find a word more insulting. It’s rather amusing how they keep doing it, denying our rights and proper treatment. 
We have to go to a phycologist to get diagnosed with being trans. You know what that method is based off? Getting diagnosed for a mental disorder. And apparently, kids who know they are trans at a young age are “too young” to make that decision. I understand where they are coming from by making that rule, but WE ARE SUFFERING. We are denied a proper childhood and we have to waste more that half of it in order to be ourselves! I have to wait more than two more years to get what I need, and I came out three years ago. I am one of the lucky ones. People kill themselves because it’s too much, and almost nothing has changed. 

End rant. I had to get that out so people understand


FYI: I’m not angry, i actually find it amusing. It’s just there’s no in between for lowercase and uppercase to properly show my emotions. I just wish humanity wasn’t so stupid
While it's wrong to ask about or assume you ""enjoyed"" it, yes transfem people (aside from those who transitioned in childhood) experienced male privilege, at least passively. Same way stealth trans men can experience it passively. It doesn't mean you weren't hurting, nor does it mean it was enjoyable. As some have stated in these comments, things like wage gap and being able to walk alone at night are male privilege. This isn't to downplay your experience or feelings, they're incredibly valid! But people cannot pretend that this doesn't exist.
So I'm not exactly sure what a terf is, but I might be called one here.

There is no denying that males/ those who present as males have privileges that females/those that present as females do not. This is something that my husband is recognizing more and more every day. I wouldn't say that it is something that most men bask in or even recognize, so it wouldn't occur to me to ask if someone enjoyed their privilege. It's more like that's how it's always been for a person, so it's normal, not some kind of badge.

Even if someone didn't ask to be amab or didn't want to be or want to be afam or whatever the case may be, there were still benefits of presenting that way? There are obviously downsides, and I imagine they could be pretty damaging. but I think there are some things that one may benefit from - like wage differences - that one wouldn't even know about or notice? 

I'm not saying that more money makes the other things go away, I'm only saying that there *are* differences.
god, yeah. its different growing up as a girl regardless of if everyone knew you were a girl at the time or not. the socialization thing really applies to ftm people in my experience (obviously everyones different though), because growing up as a cis male is just completely different.
since many trans people are thankfully able to transition earlier and earlier, its bullshit to claim that all trans women were ""socialized"" as men. also, many trans people don't internalize the messaging of their AGAB- like for trans women, they aren't necessarily absorbing the Male Perspective and Manly Ideals-- its more likely that they absorb internalized misogyny and self hatred from a woman's perspective. the whole ""socialization"" thing might ring true for some people, but isn't true on the whole.

but I do understand why some people are attached to this, in order to pinpoint privilege and oppression and clarify how people perceived as male receive certain privileges that those perceived as female do not. the thing is, it's not as clear cut as ""amab people are privileged and afab people are oppressed"". 

I like to personally refer to how people are perceived-- if you're perceived as a girl, you experience a certain type of violence and misogyny, no matter your gender. if you're perceived as a man, you experience a different form of gender roles and privilege from being perceived as a man. if you're perceived as gay or trans or too feminine, you experience that violence too. when you're perceived as cis or straight, you have that privilege. 

I think its always hard for people to accept the ways in which they've experienced privilege, especially if they experience hardship or oppression alongside it.
I feel for this post. Very well put together. Wherever you ate stay strong my trans people. ✊
i think the TERFs forgot the part about being bullied from childhood for being *not masculine* or *gay*...ye na that sucked
yeah it’s a real privilege to grow up convinced you owe deference of moral authority to TME people on account of being gaslit into thinking that your existence and the existence of girls like you amount to walking acts of rape and murder, as you’re being groomed and raped and tortured by actual fucking pedophiles, for years, and ur not allowed to speak up about it insofar as u are even able to muster the self-respect to in ur atomized fucking state because the voices rising up to counter yours belong to “real women” (whether cis women or TME trans people, it hardly fucking matters for us) who lived through “real trauma”, (and their attendant cis guy attack dogs, and sellout coward trans women) as defined by goddamn cis feminists who never bothered to ask us what our lives are actually like rather than assuming, so as to elide their responsibilities to women more vulnerable than them.
Self Suprression is not privelege! Bet these are the glssme people that say bisexuals has e straight passing privilege. 🙄
I think we have to separate the nasty way TERFs use this argument to invalidate trans women away from serious discussions of privilege when it comes to the trans community. For better or worse, being perceived as male does bestow privilege in many areas. Being a closeted trans woman makes being perceived as male suck in other ways. Those two realities coexist.
No, but you would recognize that somebody who was given the opportunity to play golf every weekend growing up will be _better at golf_ than people who didn't get that opportunity, and thus will receive more golf-related accolades and may well grow up internalizing the idea that it was some reason other than ""I was made to play golf every weekend"" that explains why they're just so much better at golf than everyone else, explicitly because they hated golf and thus ""never bothered to learn anything"" despite extended repeated exposure.

I think the issue is that ""socialization"" (i.e. how our AGAB relates to the way people treated us and the societal expectations placed on us) is not standardized. 

Trans people come from a variety of backgrounds. Some knew they were trans at a young age, some didn't find out until much later in life. Some were always GNC, some doubled down into gendered behaviors in an attempt to ""accept"" their lot in life.

There are some trans people whose experience of ""socialization"" is strongly related to not fitting the ideals of their AGAB, and being abused for it. Take the trans women mentioned as a good example. Those people may or may not have had experiences that privileged them due to their perception as ""male"", it entirely depends on how their life went. Maybe they were able to walk down the street at night without being afraid of assault. Or maybe they weren't (even because of being GNC and trans). I don't know, there are more factors than just AGAB. 

The biggest thing with privilege is that you often aren't aware that you have it until it's pointed out to you. For example, being AFAB, I never had to worry about people being afraid of me because of my perceived gender. I never had people cross the street because they were scared, or be shunned from LGBT spaces out of malicious fear (though I have been shunned for other reasons). I've never been physically assaulted for being GNC, whereas any of the mtfs I know have been beaten by their peers for being feminine.

However, I struggle to say that I didn't experience some form of gendered socialization. I internalized a lot of the gendered messaging about women and their roles, even if I absolutely hated it. It still affects my self image, to this day. I saw how boys were treated in comparison to me, and longed for it. I still obsess over my body. That's not to say that trans women don't also sometimes experience these things, but there are unique experiences to growing up as a trans person under cishet expectations. 

I think it's more complicated of a topic than saying it doesn't exist entirely, but it's also not a set of experiences that applies to every person unilaterally. 

How these things affect us do shape us into the people we become, but they don't discount our gender identity in any way, and that's the part that TERFs miss. There is no singular experience of being a ""woman"" just like how there is no singular experience of being a ""man"". Some women grow up never experiencing much misogyny at all. Some experience it in several major facets of their life. The argument TERFs use is that the common experience of misogyny and sexism is what ties women together, which simply isn't true because of the above reasons. It doesn't make trans women any less of a woman. 

But to imply that those experiences don't exist, I don't know how to feel about that. I see things swinging both ways when people talk about gendered socialization, but there's nuance that unfortunately can be very dysphoric to acknowledge, but is important to not deny nonetheless.

Edit: Privilege does not mean that you haven't experienced suffering, either. It just means that you had a certain ""advantage"" in life that other people didn't get. Often times we think that it means we must have enjoyed it, but that isn't always the case. I think we need to examine why we're so reluctant to acknowledge privilege and why it brings up so many difficult emotions.
Honestly? Male privelage in general is pretty debatable, but its undeniable that the ""normal"" childhood for a man is much worse than that of a womans. So even if terfs want to shout male privelage if it does exist it doesn't kick in till much later in life.
Its amazing how we have the same perspective about our forced socialisation…. Here something i wrote a  couple months ago about the same https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/q7bh5g/the_story_of_a_girl/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf
Thank you for posting this and for the link to the article.  The many years of struggle and disenfranchisement and marginalization that I’ve experienced for being trans and being rejected from “women only” spaces because of preconceived male privilege left me without the words for the feelings of damage to my emotional health.  Finding my understanding put to words and articulated so succinctly is enormously welcome.
it’s spectacular how many terfs will say they support trans people then go spouting this shit
internalized sexism?
Because if you deny yourself any sense of self-actualization, you can *blend in* with people who otherwise might hate you! Sure, you sacrifice a huuuge chunk of your identity and suffer issues of self worth, but cmon. You get to... uh... be held to a different standard? 

Sign me up 🙄
Yep.

I felt so privileged at school being called a f*g, poofter and homo (even tho I never ID’d as gay 🙄)
Those people are the worst. They harbour prejudices and ignorance. Rather than address their own shadow they create a veneer of progressive politics. I have encountered a few of these false allies.
please report him. thats incredibly inappropriate.
I was going to say pretty much the same thing. I didn't realize I was trans growing up - I had way too much shit to deal with and I was just never told that was a thing (and if it was it was sinful). Passively, I was treated differently than I am today living and presenting as a woman.

I experienced some forms of male privilege, and I won't deny that. But I also experienced constantly thinking I was ugly and with no redeeming qualities about my personality, my name made my face burn with embarrassment when I heard it, I never fit it with ""the guys"", and felt more comfortable being friendly with the other girls - who of course saw me as a boy and therefore not part of their groups.

I do note the stark difference in how I get treated at, say, auto repair shops today as opposed to years ago. I used to enjoy not having people assume I don't know anything about cars (though I don't know much), and I was aware that was because of my male presentation.

But I think the word ""experienced"" is more apt than ""enjoyed"", and it came with a bunch of other issues with my self esteem and self image that I don't think any cis male would ""enjoy"".

I knew I was going to lose that privilege and be treated far worse in some areas after beginning transition, and it was a price I was willing to pay to be who I am. If I had male privilege in the past... Some of my recent experiences prove I sure don't have it now.
yes!!! combo of horrible oppression for being a trans woman and mistaken privilege for being perceived as a man.
Every time I see a TERF say “oh we lost another feminist” when they see a transgender man I wish they’d give me 5 dollars. I’d be able to afford my light bill this month. ❤️
Someone who didn't have a father tried to tell me how horrible I was for being critical of my own abusive father. Some people don't know how to step outside their own perceptions.
since you aren't male, I wouldn't want to say you experienced male privilege-- that feels gross to me. I'd instead refer to it as the privilege you experienced from being perceived as a man!! since you were never a man, but people saw you that way, which is why you got to escape certain misogynistic oppression. but also would point out the extreme oppression that comes from being a woman having to live as a man, and the special Turbo-Charged oppression that is transmisogyny.
I think the article does a good job at explaining how there is definitely privilege that comes with being perceived as a man, but also so so so much oppression and pain that comes with being a trans woman in the closet. 

I appreciate you voicing this, because I think its disingenuous to say there is no privilege that comes with being perceived as a man-- but there is undeniably incredible pain there for women too!! women don't wanna be perceived as men, even if there are benefits to it.
Those are the exact circumstances that actually led me to being raped. I was too afraid of being found out so I took risks I wouldn't otherwise have and ended up paying the price.

The societal pressures to conform as a man are so intense and not something I think gets enough attention. Male privilege is real yes but it's not a privilege for every man all the time. It hurts them just as often as it helps them
I’m so sorry you went through all that it breaks my heart so much!! I semi relate, except I was putting on dresses trying to fit in with a JFashion community because I felt like I wasn’t doing the right thing if I ended up being a man. Now I’m comfortable in my skin but at the same time I feel like I’m a huge fuck up sometimes for some reason because I didn’t conform to what people want if that makes sense.
I think the article does a really good job, actually!! did you read it? it has a slightly different take than OP
""Man up.""

Disgusting phrase.
thank you!!
TERF stands for Trans Exclusionary Radical Feminist (much more emphasis on the TE part rather than the RF).

For a bit of context on OP's post, TERFs will usually say things like trans women were socialised male, so they still carry misogynistic attitudes towards women, are more aggressive, and are just as dangerous as men towards women. Male socialisation is almost solely brought up to say that on a social level, trans women are still men. I almost never see it brought up with respect to trans men.

Part of the issue with blanket statements that trans women experience male privilege is that it often isn't quite true. While it is possible for some trans women to experience such ""privilege"" the anxiety and depression that often comes as a result of not transitioning counteracts that quite a bit. It's hard to benefit from easier hiring and promotions when anxiety makes interviews or approaching someone for a raise significantly more difficult, for example.

While I can't seem to find any data or articles that discuss the pay difference between cis men and only closeted trans women, trans women, closeted or not, are frequently cited as being among the groups most impacted by wage gaps. [The HRC found ](https://www.hrc.org/press-releases/human-rights-campaign-foundation-releases-new-data-on-the-lgbtq-wage-gap) that transgender people earned significantly less than cisgender women, with trans women earning only 60% of the typical worker. In the 2015 US Transgender Survey it was found that 77% of participants did things to avoid workplace discrimination such as hiding their gender, or even delaying their transition; however, despite this, trans people experienced triple the general unemployment rate and were almost 2.5 times more likely to be living in poverty. I'd say that the survey suggests that even when trans people are closeted and present as their AGAB, they still experience wage discrimination. I guess what I'm trying to say is that yes, money from male privilege doesn't make those other things go away, but often there isn't even that money.
So, I wouldn't label what you're saying as terfy, because I think you're right, I did receive certain privileges as a masculine presenting person. But it's not the same as male privilege that men receive. It's just bits and pieces of the benefits. I don't want to deny that - but it's also very reductive to call it male privilege and walk away, and it erases the complex experiences of trans women.

What would make it especially terfy is when it's used to deny trans women their womanhood, whether that's before or after their transition.

Edit: To add, I think it's important to consider that I did get some benefits, but at great cost, and that's the important context.
The whole point of social analysis is to give us tools to better relate and understand one another's experiences. I agree with you, there doesn't have to be a component of being even conscious of privilege to carry it. It may not have even been personally preferable or enjoyable, but it is still helpful to break down the freedom I have had as an AFAB non binary person as I grew up vs the staunchly different, more limited AMAB socialization. There isn't a value assigned to observing the difference. It merely exists. 

There are bigger TERFs to challenge. If you ostracize your entire community, there will be no one to stand with...
also, the article linked here was wonderful and I fully agree with it!!
Being perceived as a *cis man* does bestow certain privileges. 

Being perceived as a trans woman does not. Do you think known, visibly trans women get told, ""of course, my good sir, let's make sure you get paid in line with your cis male peers, would you like a cigar""? No, of course not: all the data show that known trans women suffer enormous discrimination. Importantly, this can even happen before you present intentionally as female.

What's absent in these discussions is any awareness that trans women simply don't get to occupy ""male"" social positionality or access ""male privilege"" except to the extent that they can successfully pass as normative cis men. For example, one of the most consistent things that happens to transfems across cultures and societies is that they tend to get bullied severely, often bullied out of education entirely. Thus femminnielli, travestis, hijras, kathoeys, etc, though separated by oceans, are usually forced away from the educational attainments that can benefit TME people
Someone who was viciously persecuted every weekend for not playing golf, even though they were ""supposed to,"" will automatically be better at golf than someone who wasn't? Idk, that's pretty questionable.
LOL yeah sure,  being battered by parents for being girly and constantly having trans women being seen as mad and unhinged and only fit for begging and prostitution was not traumatic at all nor did it leave an imprint on my psyche that took a PTSD diagnosis and years of therapy to undo. The narratives about trans women's bodies being weird and wrong and hideous also was not traumatic at all. I grew up with these narratives being the dominant narratives about trans women.    
My only problem with socialisation narratives is not the concept of AFAB socialisation ; it is the constant erasure of transfeminine socialisation by collapsing it into cismasculine socialisation ; a canard that you repeated after just straight out implying that the incoherent category of ""male socialisation"" cannot be a traumatising, brutal, process. AFAB trans people suffering from normative misogyny doesn't translate to the exact opposite for AMAB trans people.   
AMAB and AFAB are not symmetric categories - AFABness can indicate common experiences under patriarchy because of how misogyny operates - the borders of the subjugated tend to be less conditionally policed and tend to be reducible to easily markable immutable traits. AMABness on the other hand indicates divergence between cismasculine people and transfeminine people because the patriarchal roles of masculinity  and femininity are *not* symmetric and divergence is materially extremely consequential in terms of how, even if you are perceived male, you still experience differential access to power/marginalisation within. 

Beyond the certain extent of immunity to certain expressions of misogyny granted by the presumption of cis-maleness , there is a huge degree of normative force that uses violence to reward conformity to cismasculine norms and punish nonconformity to it. The very construction of masculinity as a structure that maintains and exerts patriarhal power demands that it be built around hierarchy and domination. Hierarchy without, hierarchy within. 

Note that conversion therapy was originally pioneered to stop presumed cis-boys that were too feminine from either turning gay , or worse, turning into us. Note that cis gay men continue to be at extremely high rates of physical violence from cishet men, second only to us. 

People that do not grow up transfeminine should really shut the fuck up and stop making shit up about our socialisation specifically; y'all are just transmisogynists with a dedicated committment to ignoring the lives we actually live and the goddamn temerity to think you are better than TERFs with this kind of ex-recto mental gymnastics. You're just TERFs without the conviction to own it.
What's it called when men tell women what their experiences and lives were like again?

Why do you think that in order to talk about the kind of trauma you experienced for your upbringing that you need to define transfems as having gone through the exact opposite? This is just oppositional sexism and testimonial smothering. Listen to what transfems have to say about *our* lives, don't tell us.
I feel like you may be missing the point here. No one here is saying that the way afab people are socialized isn't deeply harmful, the point is that amab trans people (and trans people in general) don't experience typical socialization the same way as cis men do.

Part of how people are socialized is how they react and internalize the pressures they are subjected to. Speaking from personal experience most of the experiences that could be described as typical male socialization didn't instill in me confidence or a sense of entitlement, they filled me with shame. I rapidly lost most of the confidence I had when I was very young and grew up a very quiet, self effacing person. Looking back I realized a lot of the experiences that shaped me weren't things that were targeted at me as a ""cis man"". My reaction to most of those experiences was of shame in not fitting, or even wanting, to act in the way I was encouraged to. Is that the same as what a lot of afab people experienced? Obviously no, but creating a dicotomy of male socialization and female socialization simply isn't accurate.

Further to that this rigid dicotomy of male vs. female socialization has often been a stand in term for gender essentialist beliefs. The Michigan Woman's Music Festival famously banned trans people but made an exception for trans men because of their ""female socialization"" and their lack of ""male energy"" effectively erasing their struggles and experiences as trans people and men. 

I'm not saying this is what you are doing, but I am encouraging you to see the complexity of how people experience their socialization. Over simplifying things doesn't help anyone, and historically has been a tool to harm. Trans femmes pointing out that they didn't experience a typical male socialization isn't about denying the pain and cruelty that afab people are subjected to from a young age, it's about trans femme people recognizing the type of pain they experienced too.  Recognizing one doesn't erase the other.
I'm not sure I understand your intention with this comment?
What's very rude is the absurd shell game you're playing. 

It's like saying, ""well, the vast majority of people assigned male at birth are cis men who are happiest with high testosterone and low estrogen. Therefore, trans women would be happiest with high testosterone and low estrogen.""

No. If you lump trans women in with cis men (""amab"") and then insist that cis men's experiences are typical for trans women, all you're doing is erasing how trans women are treated, which is dramatically unlike how cis men are treated. 

You can't draw valid conclusions about one group of people by simply redefining them as part of another group who's treated differently. That would be like prating of trans men's universal male privilege (because you've seen how men are treated--as cis men, generally!)
The downvotes on this make me sad

Transfemme here and I totally agree, I don’t understand the “I don’t want it” from people here They should want it. Everyone should have the self worth to want it. The way society treats girls is oppressive and if I was born a girl I probably wouldn’t have the self confidence I do now. We should bring our standards up to how society treats men, not down to being subservient. That being said being born a male lead to an emotional unavailability that has been extremely damaging to me psychologically and there are a lot of issues on both sides
I’d disagree that male privilege is debatable. There are some issues with the wording but the way men are treated in society is better than women. I think issue comes from the agab term because it ignores how gender and presentation intersects with that privilege. 

It’s kinda how in the US you wouldn’t say a POC man and a white man had the same privilege because they are both men, there are a lot of things that go into it.
It's absolutely ridiculous. The mental hoops they must jump through
I never could blend in. People just assumed I was gay or something.I can't count the times I had been told how weak and sensitive and a ""pathetic excuse for a guy"" before transitioning... Now that I pretty much pass, people's attitudes have totally changed .. it's nice
I mean .. those people were technically right? Since I'm now a lesbian, lmao
Well said! And like you, I didn’t really know I was *trans* but that I desperately wanted to be a girl (roll credits lol). I totally think you hit it right on the head (of course YMMV) with the nuances of presenting as male when identifying as female and the experiences that come from that circumstance. Dating other girls when presenting as male always felt “off” (as in the sense that I was one as well) yet I got along with them so much better than other guys. Talking with girls has always been easier for me too. And Jiminy Christmas, the embarrassment of a guy friend saying “*hey ladies*” to girls walking past and my face exploding was something else entirely lol. 

Anyway, you’re absolutely right. Accepting my female identity and pursuing it has certainly opened my eyes further to “losing” the male privilege (even though I never wanted it to begin with lol). It is frustrating when anyone tries to invalidate our experiences because in the end, whether you drown in an ocean or a pool, regardless of how deep the water is, you still drown. I may be optimistic, but I think you and I and a lot of other trans women and trans men have become more empathetic because of our experiences. And we seek to further understand what it’s like for other people to empathize with them so we’re not the ones making them feel invalidated, like so many have done to us. 

Damn. I honestly really don’t like the heartache and pain I’ve endured by being a trans woman, but I have to admit that I’m very glad to be more empathetic and compassionate because of my experiences. I think we’re pretty cool 🏳️‍⚧️👸❤️
Bingo, it’s a perfect recipe for ✨depression✨, right? 💁‍♀️😂
Im sorry it happened to you. I hope you're in a better place now.
Oh my gosh I wanna hug you so bad that is HORRIBLE!
Thank you, this was super informative. I definitely did not think about the mental health issues (ie depression/anxiety) having a huge impact for some individuals. My husband is the only person I have known to be a trans individual, and have very little exposure to the lgbtq+ community, aside from a few gay people, who I would consider acquaintances rather than friends. (Am trying to learn) While my husband struggles with depression, he is quite social, and excels in his work. Anyway, thanks for your comment, I really appreciate it.

They're good actually because the statements in it about transfem experiences are false.
If you think this is evil you’re either deranged or stupid lol
I agree especially on the empathy point. I certainly knew about a lot of the things cis women experienced but experiencing them first-hand is certainly an eye opener, even if you know it's a thing that can happen.

From benign things like getting people to rush and get the door or being talked down to by someone who assumes you lack understanding or experience, to getting the ""well what were you wearing"" talk at the workplace, experiences like these become so much more visceral when you actually experience them. It only bolsters my commitment to breaking gender roles and expectations whenever possible.
I don’t see trans people combat the idea that the way afab and amab people are brought up is different. What they argue is that amab trans people suffer from that difference in traumatic and damaging ways and that bringing up ‘male socialization’ for transfemme people isn’t as clear cut as many bring it out to be. 

No one is arguing that male privilege isn’t a thing, only that someones gender affects that privilege.
I don't want to misrepresent you here, but your message reminds me of men posting on feminism boards ""what about the men""? The original post is specifically about the harm and experience of masculine socialisation of trans feminine women. Reading your comments I get the vibe, 'what about the cis women'? Good question and a great conversation, but not when framed as a riposte to this specific post. It's not a zero-sum situation.
Oh totally! You are absolutely right! Starting to see both sides has been…enlightening to say the least. I’m glad to have you in our community!! <3
Their goal seems to be to belittle the struggles of others as if it would lead to vindication.

How tf do y’all go on estrogen for 3 months and pass? I’ve been on e for a year and look like garbage		"You’re a bit hard on yourself. You don’t look like garbage. You’re very pretty. Everyone struggles to find a look for themselves. All you need is to explore what works for you. You’ll look fantastic when you find what makes you happy.
There is some luck with what your started with but personally its all about life style changes as well. Exercise and hair care were very big for me. I also think you are much closer to full passing then you give yourself credit for, at least from what I see with that picture.
Girl I wouldn't have known you are transitioning to female had I not read your post title and simply encountered your beautiful self in the wild! You have very feminine facial features in this photo but I think something that could possibly help you feel more self confidence would be a different approach to hair and makeup. YouTube has many great makeup tutorials. But truly, I think you're pretty as a girl based off the presentation of this photo.
You've got hair like me!
You pass to me, what type of E and dosage are you on? Any anti androgens?
Eyebrows, hair, makeup, face-pose, and let’s be real all we see on here are cherry picked poses, filters, and some post FaceApp. Don’t believe everything you see, keep going hun
Literally went through your Reddit history. The changes are noticeable. 

You need to make a plan. List out shit you need/want to do and set little goals for yourself. I did that, kept my head down, and kept my eyes on the prize. Folks misgendered me and sometimes didn’t believe I’d come through but I did. And I’m still setting goals. 

Take things a step at a time. It took me 5+ years but in that time I went from having a shit job to having a way better paying career, a shitty but faithful vehicle, and the ability to start putting a bit of money aside. And I got a later start than others. 

You can do it. Take time to analyze your options and look into opportunities. Google is your friend and you can ask it any question you want, no matter how silly or embarrassing and it will never judge you.
We're all our own worst critics. You look like a woman to me, your features appear very soft and your skin looks great!
You're pretty though 🥺
Well everyone has different genetics, 1 and 2 everyone has their own idea of femininity/Masculinity. And 3 you're gonna pick yourself apart way worse than anyone else will and find little issues within yourself that no one else will see. 
What I'm trying to say is even if you may not feel like you look fem/masc enough to pass others probably wouldn't even notice or evaluate you that hard. So don't feel so bad. But do continue to chase your desired outcome! I find it to be so much fun watching progress through pictures.
You need to do a fuck ton of other things too. I was denied hrt but even after 1.5 years of knowing I'm trans, I'm still constantly learning stuff to look more feminine, and I'm stkll working towards passing. Plus, my genetics are decent for this. Passing is tough as shit
I mean you look a LITTLE masc but in a a way that a cis woman would look masc if that makes sense? Like I would assume you're female in public
Girl… you look feminine to me. Maybe just comfy casual, but definitely a girl. 

Remember: We are our own worst critic. 

Give it time to work and settle. Every body is different and changes differently. I think you’re kinda cute tbh.
Girl the only thing separating you from my cousin is that she's a red head.
You’re so cute tho!!
Gurl you look stunning af! Your so pretty!
I’m going to be honest I briefly thought that that was a picture of me bearing in mind I am about to fall asleep because I have drank so much alcohol but still. just look at some of my pictures
Garbage? Honey you look like a goddess 🙏
It’s working great girl :) don’t lose hope. You have a very feminine face and smile.
I think you're being hard on yourself you look very pretty
To be honest also, lots of people who, “pass” (whatever that really means) after three months usually have a lot of aid with very good makeup skills, complimentary and flattering clothing styles, lots of voice training, etc. 
I have really sensitive skin and also sensory issues, so makeup is hard for me too. I wasn’t ever read as a woman until I grew visible boobs…. Like a year and a half in. And even then it super depends on what I’m wearing. 🤷🏻‍♀️

That said, your face is very feminine and your hair is super cute! It would be hard to read you as anything other than a woman :)
Honey you have beautiful curly hair, go to a salon and have something done with it
You look like my sister if she cut her hair
You look like Ms. Frizzle from the magic school bus.

# SEAT BELTS EVERYONE

^(\*Beep Beep\*)
You definitely dont look like garbage, but your post is a giant mood though😂 It took a while for me to start seeing results as well, and I still have days where I feel like I have made almost no progress, even 3 years in. Make sure you are on a high enough estrogen dosage and dont be so hard on yourself. A year is a pretty short period, hrt wise. Exercise and eating enough is vital for effective feminization. Same goes for stress management. But again, it might be a dosage issue. If it is and your doctor is unwilling to up your dosage, find a new one. Orchiectomy did wonders for me as well. Just make sure they dont remove the tunica vaginalis if you want it to be used later for srs.
Wot you mean you look like a girl I new in school :)
That’s your brain talking, and contrary to what the wrinkly pink jello says, you do not look like garbage. Hell, I WISH I looked as female as you
Don't be so hard on yourself, you look as the beautiful woman you are :)
What?

You look like the girlgriend a friend if mine has, and I envied him so much for having met her. Back in my incel days😅
Girl, fix your eyebrows, wear some mascara.
You don’t look like garbage but clearly it’s not working for you.
[removed]
wtf
some of yall need to see an eye doctor fr. the amount of super pretty girls in this sub venting about how they are not pretty is too much. i think you have a lovely face!
Hair. Your face is pretty feminine. If you had some silky locks, no one would doubt.
i think your cute but also i feel this
Girlllll, you just need to let your hair grow longer!!
if it makes you feel any better i thought you were a woman immediately, i probably wouldnt have figured it out or noticed anything if you didnt say so
I see a fellow sentient being
id say you pass as is but i agree maybe if you could find a curly hair routine you can get into it may help you feel that you look more feminine
You don’t look like garbage. Honestly, you look almost the spitting image of a lady I used to work with, so please don’t be hard on yourself.
Everyone is unique and grow at their own rates. Sometimes things take more time and more effort for some people. I'm going on a year and a half and still nowhere near what I want lol. I'm not giving up though.
Genetics be crazy some people just born with it lol starting young helps a lot too

Though in saying that I would never have known you were trans had you not have posted here.
You do not look like garbage!  I think that you pass, and you're pretty!
Tbh, yes itss all about your mindset and what not, but main thing for me is:

- hair care/treatment ir the holy grail: REBONDING OR KERATIN TREATMENY
- LASH EXTENSION 


Despite how ""boy""-ish i dress i would still look passing AHAHAHAHA
Shut up you pass >:(
Sorry if I'm too blunt, but I think I'm similar to you. My face looks very feminine except for my brow. I often try to remember to raise my eyebrows, and I want to look into surgery to maybe just lift my eyebrows a bit, but I also don't want surgery. I just hate that my brow looks so masculine still.

But for selfies, just raising your eyebrows can help a lot! The rest of your face looks extremely feminine.

Also some eye makeup can help too. I just put some lighter tone to cover my eye bags, and simple eyeliner wings make my eyes look bigger, it really makes a difference.
Since you're unhappy with your hair: curly girl method.

I do think you pass, though. You probably see yourself in a much harsher light than any outsider would.
I would commit war crimes to get facial skin that smooth! Any tips?
Girl tf you don’t look like garbage lmao, alsoooooo I have the same hair type can you dm me I’d love to teach you more ab it :))))
 Experiment and find a style that you love. If you’re passionate about it you’ll feel better I promise. I always gravitated towards skater/punk styles so for me it was as easy as finding some baggy sweats and a nice sports bra and tee. Throw in the beanie and an attitude and I’m golden.
You'll get there, I can see it. Chin up!
I think you look amazing, and I didn't even think you were trans when I saw the picture before the subreddit
afab trans dude here. i think you look great! honestly if u like ur curly hair keep it that way but also hairstyles can help with ur face shapes as well. when i was cis i usually had bobs w/ bangs as they hid my massive ass minecraft steve jaw. but i think the jellyfish haircut might look really cute on you.
If you hope to look like a magazine model, you have to not only get in line with all the other girls, you need to remember they’re also photoshopped and airbrushed to high heaven for a specific look. It’s not bad to want to attain that look, but it’s unrealistic.

To me, you look like a healthy young woman who has fun curly hair (stating this as someone with stick straight hair that refuses to do anything). Looks like you had your hair cut short, but are now going for a fun, longer length. Hope you have fun exploring new styles as it grows!
For me its a combination of hairstyle, gym and finding clothes that convey the vibe i want. (Butch lesbian)
You look fine :\*
Everyone is different sadly. Some people need more blockers or higher doses or possibly and orchiectomy even to unlock their body’s full transitioning potential. There’s many more things that one can do , too.  It’s not fair , but yeah. And also, there’s no context for your picture since there is no before. You are looking femme.
try to put a cream in your hair and use a little makeup , every lady has their tricks
Oh, sweety. You desperately need to condition and style your hair. Get some after-shower oil and use that carefully. Proper care and styling of your hair will make a world of difference.
You do not look like garbage! I was gonna say you look cute actually.

And while it’s your mileage may vary, I don’t think a year is even long enough to know. But you’re probably not done, and you look nice now!
You look great! If it gives you more confidence though you could try some contouring.
Get your hair and brows done, a little eye and lip makeup, and find something decent to wear.

You'll be amazed!
You look adorable! Do curly girl! Do ittttttt
Pretty sure that's your sister...
you look beautiful!

something that might help though when it comes to passing would be to thin and shape your eyebrows by plucking them 🥰
Looking cute!
Girl you look closer to passing than you think. Try somthing new with you eyebrows and I think you got it :>
Nooooo you look great!!
You are incredibly lovely. I hope you see that one day xo
I think you’re being too critical of yourself. You look like a cis woman to me I honestly thought you were before I read the title of your post.
As I've heard many times before, it depends on the person how long it'll take before they'll pass most of the time. For some, it may take a short time, for some it may take longer.

Anyway, don't be too hard on yourself, you don't look like garbage at all.
OK, while everybody else's hug boxing, and I am too, because you do look fine, if you want to improve your appearance, there are things you could do. Get those eyebrows thinned and arched. Lose weight. Get that hairstyle redone so that it decides if it wants to be straight or curly, but not kinky. The fact that you do smile is a big advantage. Girls smile! Mannerism's matter also as well. Speech matters also as well. In the end I think you are a fine young lady. One of the things I teach all girls, including my own girls is to love themselves. Body acceptance. Spend some time alone or socially in the nude with naturist. Or just look at yourself in the mirror and reaffirm yourself. You must love yourself in order to be loved.
I have a female afab friend who pretty much looks just like you, so dont bear yourself up about looks.
I think you look really pretty
You are beautiful!
Don't get discouraged
Here’s the thing: afab people grow up learning beauty tricks practically from infancy so genetics and facial features play less of a role in how they look. 

Your hair is gorgeous but learn how to style curly hair - only brush it right before you wash it, don’t wash it everyday, get a deep conditioner for weekly use and an after shower moisturizer meant for curly hair. Work with a hairdresser to style your hair in a way that flatters your features. 

Shape your eyebrows, learn at least basic make up. I can help less with that because I haven’t figured out how to use make up.
Lies, you look gorgeous
YOU LOOK BEAUTIFUL 😭 those curls will be so fun and light and bouncy with a little extra love. Some other people commented that you should grow out your hair, and you should do whatever makes you happy, but I think the length suits your face and hair texture really nicely. I love fun and bouncy curls 🥰 

Elyse Myers might be able to help. She has a really similar hair texture and cut. You can find her on facebook and instagram. She's just a nice genuine person who makes funny content. She made some content recently about her curly hair care and making the change to this shorter length. And learning some self love too 🥰
you honestly have super feminine features, at the point you’re at it’s probably more about presentation than anything
I’m saying… I die a little in the inside especially the pre-HRT folks, like howw. My face is finally getting more feminine 10 months in but besides boobs I don’t have anything else going for me.
I mean… I wouldn’t have clocked you?
You look like a girl to me
Your beautiful. If your trying to look like “others”, a little hair care (a professional at a salon can point you in the right direction for your specific hair needs), trimmed brows and maybe some light make up; viola!
Personally, you look very androgynous to me. And I think, as others have said, that it's mostly in the hair and makeup rather than things that harder to change.
I've been on E for 13 years and still look like a trash bin.
I dunno what you sound like, but look wise you def pass.  When you look in the mirror you just see your old ghost.  Takes years to unsee that.  You're fine, pretty looking, and the ghost in the mirror will fade soon enough.
NO YOU DON'T.
*Deep inhale* GIRL!!!!
You do not look like garbage sister, you are beautiful
You look great! I would say that the hair is probably what some girls who pass at 3 months do.

My hair looks a lot like yours, and I don’t do much besides shampoo and condition it. I’ve been looking into hair masks and even leave in conditioner so it doesn’t have the frizz by mid-day
Honey I feel you cause I feel the EXACT same way currently bout myself but we all just bloom in our transitions differently but point is we all do bloom. Have to keep reminding myself daily but also you are being too hard on yourself. You’re very pretty! 👸💅
You look like a cis woman already, lmao. Im so jelly!
You look like my friend heather. You pass. Women come in all shades and shapes and you look like a very sweet normal lady
You do not look like garbage. You have a great look going.
working on the hair but makeup is just sensory issues galore
Yeah I wouldn’t have known, you’re very pretty
Came here to say the same thing lol! We should start a club 😂
Eyebrows are always key to me. I get really dysphoric if I let them grow wild
id make a “what if i was that girl” joke but i spent all my time with the band in school and even then i was quiet
okay everything else aside im using wrinkly pink jello now
a. yeah i know ive been meaning to get them done again

b. as i said in another reply makeup is sensory hell
I’m sorry? That’s a bit rude, ain’t it? I’m actually not tyvm, I’m sorry you felt the need to make assumptions based on the top quarter of my body
Oh I get that sister. Just remember not to be too hard on yourself. You're very beautiful as you are right now and you're only going to be more so as time moves on
r/curlyhair may be able to give you some suggestions if you are looking for some!
I’ve got some curly hair tips if you want them from a trans guy with curly hair similar to your type
I have some wild sensory issues too (ASD). But there are some very little things that can really help. If you are interested in makeup. 
Just a tiny bit of eyeliner, and maybe even a light brown mascara can make a huge difference for your own self perception. I know the biggest issue is that we see our selves everyday as we change on hormones, so we don’t really notice the change. I’ve never been misgendered in public without makeup and it blows my mind because I still feel like I look like a dude, particularly in the face. The makeup really helps my own self confidence, it’s just for me, so when I look in the mirror I don’t see old dude face.
You definitely pass. 

As a trans woman and former hairstylist with curly hair i can tell you that learning to style curly hair after transition took a bit more effort. Especially when all my family members have straight hair. 

This is a curly hair method that I use myself. 
I rarely use actual shampoo in my hair. Maybe once a month. But whenever i wash my hair in the shower i always always use conditioner and i use a newer product that is called a CoWash. Its not as common to find on shelves but its a “cleansing conditioner”. I will brush through my hair with a WetBrush. Dont use a rigid comb. Use a brush with very soft flexible bristles. Wetbrush is a brand I highly recommend and i dont know how i used to live without it. After i brush through my hair i do not rinse out all of the conditioner. Curly hair needs moisture to penetrate. Once i step out if the shower i will wrap my hair with a towel to absorb excess water. I will than add a small amount of very light styling gel and brush through again to help distribute the gel evenly. My personal favorite is garnier fructice clean style gel. I will than let my hair air dry as I continue to get ready for the day. Once my hair is dry, and this is important not to do it too soon while your hair is still wet (because if you do this part before your hair is dry you will just end up with frizz!) but once it is dry i will scrunch my hair with my hands to break up the gel.  This will result in bouncy ringlets in your hair rather than frizzy tangles. This will usually last me 2 days of nice curl. If it gets messy and I don’t have time to style it i might wear it flat ironed on low heat for a day or twi before I repeat this again.
Lmao mine 2. Took me years to somewhat be able to take care of it
Let me know when this club starts! I need all the help I can get cause I have almost identical hair to the OP and it frustrates the hell out of me! Messes with my dysphoria big time
Now I’m just curious wot you play sorry have a thing for instruments 
have way to meany lol
You can get your eyebrows microbladed and get eyelashes professionally done. That will go a long way. I look like my dad if I don’t get mine done (48 yo woman here)
I’m going to say this much nicer than they did, so pay them no mind lmfao

You’re looking to “pass,” which means that you wish to fit into society’s ideal look of a girl? Estrogen only takes us so far, honey, and while you look amazing, sometimes we have to give some nudges of our own.
id love to hear them
the issue is that i do get constantly misgendered in public. i have asd too, but ill give mascara and eyeliner another try even though last i tried they gave issues
Same, I’m literally tryna get OP to dm me so I can fast track the curly hair suffering for her 😂
ur fine! I’ve played clarinet for about 9 years
It’s hard to really comment without knowing heaps. Because voice could be another thing that really encourages that. Especially since ASD voice is commonly masculine coded because of our monotone. 
But it could also be clothing or a whole bunch of other aesthetic things throwing people off. Your pic here really screams femme vibes to me. 
I have found that the sensory nuisance for me is worth it for some peace of mind in another area. But your sensory impact from it could well be greater than mine.
I would love to hear your technique! Always trying to learn more

What I do now is shampoo every other shower and condition every shower (i shower every other day). I let conditioner sit for 15mins and then rinse briefly. I use a towel to clench it a little dry and let it dry all the way by air. I really like the conditioner I use but maybe there are better ones. I do need a good shampoo though, I just go with whatever rn. Also I'm a night time showerer so keeping it alright over night is kinda hard

Conditioner: https://www.cvs.com/shop/herbal-essences-bio-renew-potent-aloe-hemp-sulfate-free-shampoo-frizz-control-13-5-oz-prodid-353804?skuid=353804&cgaa=QWxsb3dHb29nbGVUb0FjY2Vzc0NWU1BhZ2Vz&cid=ps_bea_pla&gclid=CjwKCAiAioifBhAXEiwApzCztsy3_0uyKp3egD8oZAZLrOOLuiKV6vTJC0eX-f-5hf0G2Gtw04hXERoCXUYQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds
it likely is voice. sucks cuz i tried voice training but couldnt get anywhere with it for reasons i probably shouldnt say
i shampoo every shower and condition every other shower. (also shower every other night) towel dry and then put [this stuff](https://www.cvs.com/shop/ogx-locking-coconut-curls-air-dry-cream-6-oz-prodid-2220158) in. doing the swirls with my fingers and scrunching it up with my hands. its not crunchy and not frizzy, but holds my curls really well. i let this set over night and wake up (somehow) with my daily hairstyle, add a beret and we groovin :)
So I’m planning on making a post for all my curly girls who haven’t been taught I think, but most of what I do is based on giving my hair what it needs, not like periodically doing the same things. 

If my hair stays clean and doesn’t build up too much grease or sweat, I can go a while without actually using shampoo, because all shampoo is doing is stripping oils from your hair. If you’re not adding oils constantly, whether by making sure to regularly eat healthy fats and foods or adding products to your hair, shampooing regularly will only cause frizz and damage and breakage to your curls. 

You gotta treat curly hair like a fine fiber, so never putting much tension on it, never squeezing it into a tight bun, never ever ever tugging with a comb without tons and tons of oils in it (hair butter, coconut oil, conditioner, anything that is a lipid. Don’t forget, only difference between an oil and a fat is what temperature they become solid complexes, when they’re on your body they do the same things) 

Edit: I’ll post a link to the post I’m writing soon, it’s too much to write in a comment
That’s ok. Have you tried seeing a speech pathologist or having one on one sessions with a coach? I know it’s too expensive for many, I’m lucky public healthcare in my country covered it for me.
i had done one on one with a coach for like six months and couldnt get anything to stick
My speech pathologist specialised with people that have ASD and ADHD. As we tend to have some interoceptive issues that make it hard to control a lot of the functions most voice training has, they had particular practices which really connect the responses that are taught. That helped me a lot, however I’m also a professional musician so my ears a very well practiced. But most resonance control training asks you to feel buzzing in your lips or cheeks and I could never feel it.
yeah im a musician too. i also couldnt practice on top of the other stuff due to my own anxieties and my parents would probably make fun of me or tell me to get better if i were to practice at home
Yeah, I used to live in a share house and could never practice for that very reason. I found moving out of home was the best thing for it as I just live with my partner now. That stress of people listening is wild, especially with my hyper vigilance. But by the sounds of things that might not be an option."	10wg27p	trans	744	0.99	2023-02-07 23:01:59

De-transition Awareness Day	"Twitter has informed me that today is de-trans awareness day. While I fully support everyone’s gender journey, I can’t help but have some complicated feelings surrounding some of the posts I’m seeing. Many de-transitioners seem to feel like they were pressured to transition from family or healthcare providers, and seem to be advocating for less accessibility to transition resources. Resources like puberty blockers and HRT- resources that would have saved me years of crippling pain and dysphoria if I’d had access to them before t puberty destroyed my body. 

It is estimated that about 8% of people who transition end up detransitioning to some extent. And of those, about 90% do so out of fear for their physical or social safety. 

Just because it wasn’t right for you doesn’t mean that it’s right to deny access to millions of trans youth around the world. 

We all have a right to our gender identities. Don’t let your mistake (their word, not mine) veer you away from allyship or towards transphobia."	"100% agree, fam. I used to lay on my living room floor and cry because E puberty made my body so misshapen.
It’s worse in the UK, with the tories in charge. It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 without a court case at this stage apparently (I have limited understanding on the matter) because of how de trans people have been depicting the healthcare system. I understand it wasn’t right for them, but they make it difficult for others
I can promise you, most of those posts will be from trolls/people pretending. Nobody is pressured to transition, and in most countries, it's very difficult to even be allowed to transition. It is naught but a way to discredit trans people
Don’t buy into this crud. TERF’s and the right-wing have formed an uncomfortable alliance on this issue, but the nice thing is our president supports us and we have the winds at our backs. We have to press forward and be visible at all levels of society. We can and will do this. 💕
Speaking of what I'd like to be improved would probably be representation of trans people and information about it. I didn't even know Trans people were a thing until I turned 18, so I was already pretty late when I started questioning which in itself took a bunch more years...

If I was explained what they were in a non condescending way when I was like 10, it would probably have changed my life for the better.
I think it can be hard to support people who detransition because of all the fear mongering that comes from conservatives.
Detransition people have been used as an argument to push a transphobic agenda. So when people mention detransition we get weary because most of the time it’s followed by transphobia. This doesn’t make detrans people any less valid.
This shouldn't be a thing.
I usually say it pretty blunt:

Any person who detransitions (for whatever reason it may be) and therefore starts to try and make transitioning an even harder process than it already is for others, is an absolute worthless person, and I also don't necessarily care if they got affected by TERFs (who do love to pile on vulnerable people like this). It's alright to be frustrated at making a wrong decision, but to put the blame on trans people makes this person a scumbag, period.

I rather have 92 people transition somewhat happily (it is already harder than it needs to be) and deal with 8 cis people (who might not be cis anyways but detransitioned for other reasons), if we take the 8% given here, from memory most of the time those numbers are actually lower in the 3% room.
i didnt De transition persay, but i was one of the many who stuffed themselves back in the closet out of fear for their own safety. it kills me every single day i really wish i could be strong enough to just be who i am but ive had too many straight death threats from strangers to ever feel safe tbh. now even when i Know im safe the memories of getting the shit beaten out of me, or getting kicked out of public spaces, or my parents being my angry then I've seen them in my life. idk if ill ever feel comfortable in my own skin. i cant hell but feel had i had access to puberty blockers of some kind this wouldn't be the case but idk. long story short, a little understanding and empathy can really change someone's life
I detransitioned when I was younger and spent a few years as my agab. there were a few different reasons but they didn't hold up. a lot of my life would be way way easier if I had not done it but I also had experiences in that time that wouldn't have been possible otherwise. It was definitely part of the journey but Idk if I'd do it over again. unfortunately the stories that fit the conservative narrative get a lot more attention than those like mine.
I'd be willing to bet just about anything the vast majority of people actually presenting this stance aren't and never have been trans. It's just transphobes posing as ex(?)trans people.
I really like how you framed this cause it's real complex and how it's politicized also further complicates it

. [It does happen but it's mostly not that they aren't trans but because of pressure, but even so some people who do detransition discover they weren't trans, but then politically it's used to defend anti trans laws -> very complicated]

I really learned a lot about de transitioning from Elle Palmer on YouTube. She's part of the 10% of the 8% that de transitioned cause she realized that she wasn't trans. She also addresses these statics and nuances and explicitly states that it's rare to be in her situation and that she still supports trans rights and everything. 
At least from the few videos of her's I watched.

I recommend folx her videos (a little cautiously cause I think the topic in general can give some dysphoricy vibes, for lack of a better term). I really had not much info on this topic outside of how it's weaponized by conservatives
I guess Twitter just meant awareness for a bad example
Now I will always grow facial hair. My voice will always sound too low and distorted to me. Trans men who decide to get top surgery will always have their scars. Just to name a few examples. It really sucks to see people advocating that this is something trans children deserve to go through. It’s too late for me, but it’s not too late for them.
The story is way worse than you know

The person who filed that court case didn't get their hormones until after the age of 16. My understanding is they've essentially slammed the door for all children in Britain

Over something that didn't even happen to them
Yeah the UK is fucked up right now for trans people.

I’m originally from England with a lot of family there and in Northern Ireland, and I don’t feel like it’s safe for me and my family to travel back there any more - which makes me very sad.
>It’s impossible to get even blockers before 18 

But do they even have any purpose at all at that point?
no no, there are genuine detrans people out there.

except, they just like to peddle the myth that ""society forced them to transition"" as a way of excusing the fact that it was probably them who lied to their therapist as a way of getting HRT for some reason that wasn't related to being trans.

obviously it sucks an incredible lot for them and I genuinely feel for them, but I also feel for the trans kids who have to live their lives with a ruined body and with people gaslighting them into being their AGAB, who are probably living the same exact pain and suffering from dysphoria that detransitioners are.

except the only difference is that detransitioners are treated like children who fell off the monkey bars, while trans people are treated like war criminals.
Sorry, I live in America. You’re right. We actually have it okay here. I know it’s hard in other country’s rn but we HAVE to fight for what’s ours. Nobody is going to just give us our rights.
Look, I lurk on the different detrans subreddits, and some of them are honestly people in pain going through a difficult time after transitioning for the wrong reasons. Yes, some detrans people totally flip and become transphobic and that's bad. It is terrible that detransitioners are used as a weapon against trans people, but that doesn't mean we should throw all them under the bus, and deny them the right to call for awareness altogether.

I believe that awareness about detransitioners is important despite the transphobic crap can sometimes accompany it. For one, it's an important thing for people who are questioning to learn about in deciding whether or not transitioning is right for them. And two, some detransitioners are trans allies, and trans people pushing them away will only alienate them from us.

As trans people, detransition should remind us that not everyone questioning their gender is trans and should transition, and that the best way to help those how are questioning is to encourage them to explore everything, and take time to decide what's best for them.
What shouldn't be a thing?
I think some of you are making it more complicated than it is. Isn't it just that some people have gender dysphoria, transition then the dysphoria changes and they realise they don't want to be transitioned, so they detransition? I've been watching some of their videos. None of those said they were pressured by anyone to detransition, only they felt it inside.
One thing I will say if you are a trans man new top surgery techniques have made scars basically invisible just wanted to say because a lot of people might not be aware
That really brightens my future then. I bloody love the conservatives, always focusing on the right things. Like it’s in their nature to be bigots but they could at least wait for the international problem to end first
I was genuinely unaware of it all too, luckily I’m in the most trans friendly area of the place, but I only found out recently that I won’t be able to get HRT for even longer than if I was on a waiting list. I don’t think a lot of people realise how much damage they’re doing
Scotland is pretty chill though if you overlook the blatant human rights violations committed by the SNP government
Puberty continues for a few years after that, especially for facial and body hair growth. But, for the most part, the effects on bone growth, muscle development, and so on are done. It's messed up because if puberty blocking were generally accepted, the risk of transition regret would go down since gendered development would be delayed by some number of years. (In order to ensure proper development after resuming, they can only delay certain effects so long, so which effects are blocked varies.)
Adding on, you have to be on blockers for a year before HRT at least as a minor under the NHS
I completely believe there are people out there who felt something they perceived as pressure to transition, and then detransitioned when they discovered that it wasn't right for them.

I also believe there are people out there who felt transition was right for them, then discovered that it actually wasn't, and have used ""pressure from society, etc"" as a reason for why they transitioned in the first place in order to reduce how much of a mistake they're owning up to.

And finally, I believe the vast majority of people who decide to detransition do so out of a loss of insurance or financial capability to continue their transition, threats to their safety, health and wellbeing, and just overall unhappiness feeling like a persecuted class in society or a combination of all of these reasons.
>society forced them to transition

What society to they live in? A conservative fever dream version of Portland?
Of course there are real detrans people, no doubt. But all research shows that it's very few, and only a tiny tiny part of them do it because they regret it, and not out of outside pressures/circumstances. I'm talking about the people online who peddle detrans stories as a reason as to why no one should be allowed to transition. I'm willing to bet that very very few of them have ever transitioned, let alone detransitioned.
yep, there are plenty of genuine detrans people. and they get preyed on and manipulated by the terfs. chewed up and spat out when they're no longer useful.
De-transition awareness day should not be a thing. It's just an excuse to attack trans rights.
I'm not negating their experience. I'm saying that a whole day devoted to it will do more harm to the community than good (which includes trans people who decide to detransition).
Only for smaller chests, right? Anyways, surgeons in my country won't learn it for years... :/
I’m sorry to hear that. Yeah the wait times are out of control 😩
[deleted]
Yeah, it is one thing to validate the people who did ""de-transition"" and another thing to make a WHOLE DAY dedicated to it.
I think it should be a thing, but it shouldn't be a valid excuse to attack trans rights. It should be a day for people to actually learn or be educated about why people detransition, the stats and how the only solution is to make resources more accessible and easy to experiment with.
it's terf propaganda, nothing more.
It is a bit like ""I prayed the gay away"" day or something...
Which,  is very icky. 
And definitely used as an excuse to attack our rights.
only for small chests yes :/

I wanted to jump into the piles of blahaj at my Ikea (like 100 blahaj at one spot) so badddd I had to hold myself from doing so 🥺😖😖
What do you think Ikea employees think? Do they get a shipment in and then judge everyone who walks by the bin holding the sharks in? Does Ikea know?  I have more questions about Ikea than the trend lol.
Same question. Why tho? Is there any story behind this? I'm too lazy to google and find out, so some secrets are meant to be not uncovered.

Reporting hate pays off	"To anyone receiving transphobic comments or hate comments in general, don't ignore them. Report the hate cause it pays off. I got this from Reddit this morning:

War is war.

Good job!
I have also received that message myself
Good work. Don't just accept it, standing up for yourself is standing up for others too.
I had a creep in my DMS send me a picture of himself in underwear that I didn't ask for. I reported the picture and the next day I got a massage saying that they didn't see any rule violations
I've gotten mixed results from reporting, sometimes there was a temp/perm ban, sometimes they say it was not against the rules, or the user was just given a warning.

But I still think it's worth it.
i reported a few hate posts and comments already, and only 1 they said wasn't against the rules but the rest were all warned.
I find every time I report hate I can a message back saying it didn't violate any rules, and I always have to request that they double check again before anything is done about it
Accept if they're ""just"" misgendering. Then reddit doesn't give a sh!
I would try to but they eighter block me or delete it immediately after, I'll make sure to screenshot the usernames, FYI to the transphobes 😐
wow....
I’ve literally reporter dozens of transphobic posts and in every single case I got a “doesn’t violate Reddit policy” response
Yes! I found a random KKK account posting racist memes on IG (while searching for something else). I reported it and they banned the person. 

Now I wish I had started doing that sooner. I used to get a lot of hate and see a lot of hate on Facebook. I wish I had reported the people.
I get a lot of those . I report comments and stuff a lot.
They get taken down extremely fast so you can't respond to them anyway ;0
Wow reddit really sucks
Yeah,  that's why I turned DMs/following/chat off on this account. I kept getting random sick pics.  We shouldn't have to worry about this like that.   Reddit generally won't do anything unless they're called out.
Sounds good. They shouldn't get away with it even if they're just trolls :0!
Same. If Reddit doesn't react I just report the same stuff again until they do something

I'm scared to be in my country	"I live in Britain and my government seem to be proud of their transphobia. Rishi Sunak (current pm) has recently said he's going to review the Equality Act to make it clear that sex means biological sex and not gender. He's going to remove trans people from the Equality Act meaning all trans people in this country, transitioned or not, are going to have our rights of safety removed. 

I could be kicked out of education, denied medical need, denied a job all because I'm trans. I do hope my transphobic government know this is endangering many lives, not like they care and we can't even protest against it because they made protesting illegal. I can't stand this country and knowing that my life and many other's lives are going to be at risk..I'm terrified of living here.

ETA - Protesting isn't illegal but being loud during it is and police can search you if they think you're protesting 

ETA part 2 - I currently can't move out of Britain as I'm in education and don't have a job but I do plan to leave as soon as I can

https://www.thepinknews.com/2022/11/01/rishi-sunak-trans-equality-act/"	"I completely understand your fear. I left the UK a couple years ago, and I feel much happier for it. I spoke to some of my friends in the UK about this, and they said something that I think might help you feel a bit safer, at least in the short term.

According to my (also trans) friends, it's very unlikely that the changes to the equalities act would be approved by parliament. They would be unpopular, even among tory MPs, and if Sunak tried to remove trans people from the equalities act without consulting parliament, it would cause a revolt because the government being able to take people's rights away in that way would look unacceptable, even to a lot of tories.

So like obviously the situation in the UK is completely unacceptable, and something needs to be done about it. I feel so much for all my trans siblings there. But hopefully this goes some way to helping you feel safer, at least in terms of the equalities act.
Yeah the nickname for the uk is terf island, its famous for its transphobia
So much of the work is heading in a dark direction. Personally, I’d be making plans to leave. Australia is nice, hopefully it stays that way.
Same, i live in the uk, really worried at the moment.
come to the netherlands
As a disabled person, I can unfortunately attest to the validity and seriousness of your fears. During the Global Financial Crisis, the British Government brought in all kinds of ""austerity measures"". Tens of thousands of people were kicked off welfare they couldn't survive without. Thousands of disabled people died. I lost quite a few dear friends. It was horrific and thry got away with it by turning abled people against us.

There was an intensive media campaign, fear-mongering about ""welfare cheats"" and ""disability fakers"", claiming that they made up a huge percentage of welfare recipients, when in reality, they're actually very rare. It was already extremely difficult to access support, even before the GFC. When the austerity measures were implemented, it became literally impossible for most of us and people everywhere were on the hunt for supposed ""disability fakers"". It was terrifying.

A friend of mine was assaulted by a group of strangers in the supermarket because she stood up from her wheelchair to reach an item on a high shelf. Another was assaulted and had her guide dog forcibly taken from her by strangers at a train station because someone saw her using a mobile phone (because assistive tech on phones for blind people isn't a thing, I guess?). Another had police called on him for using accessible parking and was prevented from leaving until they arrived, even though he clearly had a valid permit displayed. His treatment by the officers who attended was equally appalling.

The same playbook is being used against trans people now. It's harrowing just how well-trodden this path is. They know extremely well what they're doing. They're experts at it, by this point.
If you are English you can move to Scotland and then become Scottish! Help us vote for independence and then you'll be free from that hellhole.
holly fuck i’m so sorry to hear that:( i pray for you guys 🙏
The Tory party are sick, evil malcontents. It’s not enough to casually consign thousands to a lonely death while they party on, they have to actively target a minuscule percentage of the population out of deliberate cruelty.

 When it comes to Tories, the cruelty is the point.
That’s a massive human rights violation.
WAIT WHAT ABOUT PROTESTING?????
The world is turning to sh*t as we inch closer to WWIII!!!
Every time I hear something about the UK, I see more and more where the US gets it…. Stay safe my friend.
Yes in live in Manchester and it’s quite terrible
Germany isn't quite better unforunately.
Yeah the current government is nice to LGBTQ (thanks to ""die Grüne"") but a there is growing discontent.
The ""CDU"" saw a growth of voters since last election unforunately..

But stay safe 🏳️‍⚧️ Hope you get out of the UK asap 🙏   🏳️‍⚧️💮🏳️‍⚧️
I am so sorry you’ve had to endure this. There are states in the US that are passing very oppressive and discriminatory laws, but we do have sanctuary states, thankfully. I just hate this trend of trans people being political targets. This should not happen anywhere. I hope you have a solid support system that can help.
I’m not advising arson, but Britain and burn both start with b.
I live in the state of Florida. The governor here is refusing healthcare to trans children and would like trans adults to have to register like a sex offender. no way in hell will I ever register. I have not committed any crimes.

You and your family are always welcome in Colorado U.S.A. it may not be much better here in the U.S. but here in Colorado specifically our state government, who stands with the trans community, is pretty much guaranteed to be in power for at least another decade if not more due to gerrymandering etc. 

Im so sorry you have to go through this. And if you decide to stay and fight the good fight just know you have compassion and support from all over the world. <3

Brit here too, it’s scary and I heard about this a few weeks back. There was a petition around the time they where reviewing the acts but I’m not sure if it got passed or not . Fingers crossed
I guess its not the best timing on my end to figure myself out :D

Gotta love it.
What exactly do they think biological sex even is?
Thats one hell of a human rights violation
I'm so sorry you don't feel safe!  You are seen, you are loved.
I also live here and fear for my rights. Things have always been bad before but it just feels like they keep getting even worse
This is just an idea how about we take the governments fancy paychecks and security away and then see if they are so inclined to start stripping other peoples rights
I have a question and forgive me if it sounds dumb but I thought the King/Queen can have influence on some policies in the UK? I thought they were lgbt friendly. Can someone help me understand this
I literally feel the same way but the cis people in my life don't think anything bad is going to happen. I know they're trying to help me feel better but Idk.. sometimes I feel like they don't understand why these threats worry me so much. Even if they don't actually do anything, the fact that they can make those threats so openly is already scary
Yall should come to a country that is open to all in the LGBTQIA2+ Community and inclusive and open to those seeking asylum.... and I don't just mean US, you got Ireland, Netherlands, Norway, Finland, Germany, Brazil, New Zealand, USA, Thailand, France, Spain, etc..... You are safe on here and we see you and hear you.... we validate your womanhood and any truama you have experienced in your life..... We love you....

I was already denied service from my GP for being trans lol time to leave this world.
Tbh, I'm reading through this and can't understand how he's making it unsafe for trans people. Saying sex does not equal gender is a true statement. Can someone explain better? I don't know anything about British politics.
Have you thought of finding somewhere trans friendly and moving there?
There's always Canada. You'll have the benefit of coming from a commonwealth nation, and depending on education get preferential immigration. I find even the most backward places here are pretty tolerant.
I’m so sorry!  It’s bad everywhere incl USA
British govt not be corrupt and abuse it's citizens challenge level(impossible)
Yeah, it's rather depressing. Try stay strong, it's what I'm doing.
I think it’s time to rename my Canadian province of British Columbia to something less offensive. The Brits came here and destroyed aboriginal culture including their trans inclusiveness. I don’t want to be associated in anyway with Britain or their fucked up Royal family.
I’m officially glad I plan on moving when I’m 19
Understandable (I'm in the UK too) however you should know that those threats are meaningless. Biological sex doesn't really have a legal meaning, and the closest thing to it is what the equalities act already uses, so there isn't really much to be done there. That's not to say that their open transphobia isn't still scary, it's just that their threads of action aren't anything to be worried about, at least for the time being.
Rishi is being a bit of a naughty asshole, but right now it feels like a lot of talk. There are serious obstacles to him inacting those plans. So while it is a concern, you probably don't need to be scared.

The uk is for the most part a safe place to live. So don't let a stinky tory stop you living your best life.

With a bit of luck he will lose his job in a year or so and it will be back to business as usual
I'm an American so take what I say with a grain of salt, but I've heard Scotland tends to be a lot more progressive, especially in terms of it's government, if you have the ability and want to move. The state I live in the U.S. doesn't include trans people in it's anti-discrimination laws, so you just gotta try to stay strong and find safe places where you live, if it makes you feel better just remember that these anti-trans laws are backlash to growing acceptance, so these laws won't last forever
Can someone explain exactly how it will affect me? 

Because It sounds like it won’t much at all, I’m legally a girl. I was born a boy. 

So yeah what am I missing?
Feeling this, im also from the uk. I didnt know he was this bad, i knew him an liz truss we're transphobic but not to this extent.

This country is my home, i love it but this is why i hate it. We already feel trapped and unsafe in our own bodies so why is it fair that we feel the same way in a country we should be able to call home!
Thank you. That does make me feel safer
This is what gives me some kind of hope. Whilst Sunak might want to do this by himself, it would be horrifically unpopular and be the equivalent of international politics suicide. Cameron first brought this up back in his tenure, every Tory PM has mentioned it, but it hasn't happened so I doubt it will
why do they think any Tory MPs give a shit about trans people? they don't. even most of the opposition doesn't.
I too left the uk 4 years ago for similar reasons, I now permanently reside in France where trans people widely accepted. The best move I ever made, I’m the happiest I’ve been in years 😘
That sums up the UK, mainly Britain, perfectly
I'd say Terf government island because not every person there is a Terf but yeah Terf island sums it up pretty well.
I already have plans of moving away but right now I want to pass college and then I'll focus on moving away
The coalition is virtually unelectable rn, and given the general attitude last election I don’t think we have to worry to much
Please stay safe, I have full hope that in 2024 we all avoid voting for the Tories
That is the country i plan to move to. That or Norway, both are amazing countries
Thank you for the reminder that solidarity is crucial to our safety. Its an important lesson for queer people around the world to remember that if another marginalized group is being targeted for genocide, it is only a matter of time until the weapons they develop to do that are turned on another group, possibly us. 

This is personally why i think when it comes to activism, disabled people should be included in the lgbt movement explicitly. We have 1 crucial thing in common, a need to protect our rights to exist as human beings against state power and hatemongering
I'll keep that in mind, thank you
Thank you, hopefully this won't happen but knowing the Tories, it will
It is, it makes me so angry but if history class taught me anything is that when you take away rights from minorities we just fight hard and prevail. I just hate how it has to come to this but I’ll protest and do whatever it takes to defend my trans youth community and older trans community. 🏳️‍⚧️
Most things they've done are. They don't care for the country they care for the money
If I've learnt anything, this means nothing if the population in power doesn't think its a base human right. There is no concept of human rights set in stone, even what is laid out by the UN changes.

Look at countries such as Qatar, they do not believe it is a human right to be queer. 

I personally believe this contributes to these discussions internationally fall apart. Western cultures create this idea of what a human right is and other countries don't agree. 

I believe it is a massive human right violation but MANY people don't, and they won't listen to that
Protesting isn't illegal but making loud noise during it is and police can search you if they think you're protesting. So, we aren't allowed to be loud during protests
yeah because that has ever worked for us in the UK
We aren't learning from history so we're just repeating it
We're just the America of Europe
The UK is getting it from the US. Specifically US evangelicals and libertarian thinktanks. Same place the US gets it from
Stay safe as well, i hope everything gets better in Germany. Sending love 🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
I live in a state in the US that's trying to ban lgbtq out of everything... Florida! It's awful 😖😮‍💨
I'm sorry that's happening to you. I hope everything gets better soon
Right now, yes but i do plan to move out of this country
Thank you that means a lot. I'm going to stay for a bit and try to fight back
I'm sure everything will be okay. If he, or any government, manages to pass this and remove our rights i know that no one will be okay with it and there will be many, many strikes and protests
I'm guessing what you're born as and ""What's in your pants"". The articles all spoke about banning trans people, mainly trans women, from single sex areas, like banning trans women from women bathrooms to keep cis women 'safe'. So my guess is they follow to logic that if you were born a man, you're a man even if you have had surgery to turn into a woman and you now have woman's body parts you're still a man.
I completely agree
The king/queen is just a figure head. We have our own government. The leader of our country is called the Prime Minister, they are meant to lead the country until the next general vote but, as we have recently seen, that seems to be impossible seeing as we've had 3 within this one year. We have 4 major political parties: the Conservative (also known as Tories) are the current government in power, the Labour Party, the Green Party and the Lib-dem party. The Tories care more for money, the Labour Party more for the people, the Green Party care for the environment and the Lib-dems are a bit of both Tory and Labour. We also have different governments for different counties, so we have 2 separate votes. The main vote, deciding the next UK government and then the county vote, deciding which government will run the county you live in.

That is so gross, i am so sorry you had to go through that. Where does your GP live? I just want to talk to it
The Equality Act makes it illegal to discriminate against anyone. Him changing the act to make it clear that sex=biological/birth means people can say ""you're not a man because you're birth certificate says female, you can't use these male only spots"" no matter if you're transitioned or not or have a card saying that your sex is different than what's on your birth certificate. Doctors can refuse giving us treatment because we aren't what our birth certificate says we are. Doing this means that he can remove the gender identity part from the Equality Act and start banning us from same sex areas because our genders ≠ our birth sex. He also openly says that this will prevent us from ""brainwashing"" the public
That is my plan for the future
I'll look into studying abroad in Canada for a bit
Moving is also one of my plans
Scotland is way better than Britain. I am so jealous of them and I feel sorry that they aren't independent from us. Wales has also proven to be better, same with Northern Ireland and Ireland
Also, Disclaimer that I’m American but Rishi Sunak has been criticized for being “MIA”. He has way bigger fish to fry than passing bigoted legislation, which would be bad for his optics. Even conservatives are mad at him about not doing anything. I don’t think he *could* do anything
It's not that they give a shit exactly. A few of them might, but no, for the most part they don't particularly. It's two things - on average, the UK population actually supports trans rights, so it would be an unpopular move to support restricting trans rights. And it sets a dangerous precedent, and at least in my friends' view, enough tory MPs care enough about the consequences of setting a precedent to strip people of their rights in that way. It could happen to other minority groups more easily if it happens to us.
Also jk rowling is a bitch, why would she interfere in every transgender solution
The UK is screwed economically for decades to come, so even without being lgbt is not going to be a good country to build your life in. I’d have left already if I was there for that alone.
Doesn’t even matter who we vote for anymore, Labour is currently no better than the tories. Our country is fucked.

I mean...a ton of disabled people *are* LGBTQ+ people. People seem to forget that. There's an appalling amount of ableism and disableism in a lot of LGBTQ+ communities. We're routinely excluded from our own spaces.
Yeah! Scotland isn't too far and all the trans friendly regulation is awesome, England is burning and everyone that's good needs to jump ship lmao
That’s honestly just really sad…
I did not know about that, thats fucking awful. Thanks for explaining
Yeah, but still laws against are a really bad thing.
History does repeat. It’s just a question of when. We can only hope things stay stable in our lifetimes.

Yes. In a year, I hope to finally escape Florida for college
Arkansas, Texas, Alabama, Missouri and Tennessee too! It’s terrible. Florida is the worst! My trans senior is having to look for colleges in a state where she will be safe from this! Her family is considering moving too! So sad having to flee your state.
It's is happening to the children but he cannot do anything to the adults. But that won't stop him from trying. And this @sshole wants to be president. I hope he doesn't get in.
Good, that's okie dokie
So they're basically just deciding this despite biology being completely different all because of what some doctor says you are when you're born? Do they even know that intersex people exist?
Okay, that's terrible. I hope he's unsuccessful. Thank you for explaining.
There used to be this Tumblr called “transgender housing network.” But it seems it is no more. Do you think Reddit would be a decent place to create such a group?
There's a serious shortage of people out west, and despite a few loud anti-trans folks (trust me, a very vocal, but also very small minority) and even some in power, our constitution and charter of rights provides built in institutional protection. 

For example, the Government of Alberta has recently been running ads across the country to try to attract workers, despite knowing that many of them would be left leaning.  Furthermore, it's very possible that after the next provincial election the NDP (think left of the aisle) party will gain control of the legislature again. The conservatives here have gone way off the rails.
Scotland once again being the most based country in the UK
sorry for being pessimistic but realistically Tories don't care. they are entirely morally bankrupt, they would be happy to take away the rights of other minority groups too if they were allowed. and unfortunately even though a small majority of the public may say they support trans rights, most of them are far too indifferent to actually do anything to protect our rights. support for trans people has also fallen dramatically over the last few years due to the relentless onslaught of transphobic bullshit from the British media.

I was born and raised here, i am unfortunately British. My family is here and i still live with them. I do plan to leave soon though, once i find a stable job and get the money too
at the very least, Labour is 'supposed' to care.

When we demand equality from Tories, they attack us.

When we demand equality from Labour (if/when they get in), hopefully they at least act like the US Democrats (i.e. mostly in favour of the status quo, not actively attacking us)
arnhem is based
is jumping ship to france also an option? since that's what i plan to do
The government hid it in another law. I forgot the law but they hid it in a law that improves this country so if anyone were against that particular part of it they could say ""so you don't want this bill to pass, so you don't care about Britain?""

It was, as usual, a disgusting thing they did
Congratulations be safe and make the best of it
This is true im not sure when i can get out of here im pushing to go through a divorce from my cisgender transphobic husband and move to Georgia idk how much better it will be but i have really supportive friends there
They probably don't know intersex people exist, in their minds you can be either male or female and that's it
Sorry i didn't explain it greatly. Thankfully, he needs to go through either the House of Commons or the House of Parliament to get this to pass (I'm not sure which one does it) so he needs the majority vote before he can pass it
I think it would be
What??
Should probably put quotes around this before you get downvoted into oblivion
Yeah, I understand the issue. There’s many British people here in Australia. The problem with emigrating is not just a job and money, but being eligible get in. Being young and qualified, in whatever the government happens to want, is very important. Definitely look into the requirements and plan ahead.
Bruuuuuuuh I said don't 108 days ago
I wouldn't, especially since the far right has begun to gain traction. Only places I recommend are Scotland, Brazil and Norway.
Anything in the Southern states is questionable. The colleges refuse to provide Gender Inclusive housing like the rest of the nation. It’s very frustrating and extremely homophobic!
[deleted]
Thank you, I'll look into it
hehe
Wouldn't recommend Brazil. They might have changed government but the far right is still very strong.
That's true i don't plan on going to college but i really don't have any other choice so i opted when i can to go to Georgia and live with my friend I've known him forever

Sounds like the living embodiment of trash, good luck, friend
Make sure you have an exit strategy: a friend/family member who you can stay with, duffle with clothes and important documents, etc.

It sucks you have to deal with that crap.
Hope it goes okay. All my best vibes
You're mom has terrible judgement. Get ready to record.
If your mum supports you she probably shouldn't be dating that guy in the first place
Your mom's an ass for staying with him, ngl... Good luck OP :/
Good luck, though if your mom loves you but is still with this person knowing he dose that stuff there will be trouble ahead
GOOD LUCK WITH EVERYTHING, HE SHOULD RESPECT YOU ANYWAY😡
Does your mom know he's horrible towards you? In that case, how does she not even try to organise something (like you going to your dads for a week or maybe, you know, not having him cime over for prolonged time without ensuring he won't be awful)??
Wishing you safety!
You communicated clearly my friend, anything that happens with his bullshit is not your fault. Stay safe love
Damn, you know its bad when you have to write down ""don't use my dead name"". Sounds like this guys an asshole, wishing you luck.
Just a thought here, but in my experience, and I've got *some* anyways, people harbor certain viewpoints from a place of ignorance. Not necessarily willful ignorance, but they just don't know, or haven't had a reason to care to know.

I'm not trying to predict the future here, but maybe there's an opportunity to change at least one mind. Is your mom supportive? If so, you could maybe have a little chat about things at the kitchen table. I know I've had a few work relationships with people that I thought would be horrible but after some time and conversations turned out to be really good.

Just sayin' is all...

Anyways, I hope things go alright for you.
so sad mashallah you recover from this
Go practice a new hobby that happens to be far far away. Or start a new one. Or stay over at a friends house for study/gaming. 

By parents are divorsed and i always loathed my dads girlfriends. I just started ignoring them as much as i could. They are not worth my time.
Maybe he is just ignorant and will change at least his outward behaviour once he understands the people he is targeting and how much he hurts them. Humans are genetically programed to look out for one another, no one enjoys causing other people harm unless they have a mental disorder. If he doesn't change even after you explain stuff to him you should sit down with your mom and have a talk. Any good parent will priotise the safety and wellbeing of their child over their partner.
Ugh my aunts boyfriend is like this and I can't fucking stand him. You got this, it's only a bit over a week right? I think you got this, just keep reminding yourself that his opinion and views do not matter or actually affect your life. Just continue to be you, he doesn't like it? Then oh well he can fuck off. I know it will be hard but best of luck to you. I'm know I'm just some guy in Reddit lol but I believe in you. 😎
This sounds potentially very dangerous. Safety first, and like another commenter said, have a bag packed, escape route, and safe place planned.

I am sorry that your mom is putting you through this. It all sounds abusive. 

Sending you strength 💜
Sleep with him to assert dominance ^(/s)

Hope life improves 💜
Well if your mum is supportive, he better get in line fast if he wants to stay with you both there.  
 Just try to stay away from him as much as you can until he leaves.   
If he gives you trouble maybe you should mention it to your mom.
Don't give him targets like commenting on weight he might use it against you. Just remember you can lose weight but he will always be a cunt
thankyou

My mom outed me	"I’m 18 an y/o trans woman who came out to my parents a couple weeks ago. They seemed at least accepting and were willing to help me with coming out to my family. However over the past couple of weeks they have said and done some incredibly hurtful things.

The first thing I noticed is that they refuse to affirm the fact that I am a woman. For example, I started using my girl voice full time and from most people I’ve heard its actually pretty good, but my dad called it cartoonish and unconvincing once I showed it to them. I worked really hard and had felt very confident in my voice but after hearing that is started to dysphoria spiral. 

The second is the constant forcing of me to answer uncomfortable questions. It seems like every time I’m in the same room he asks the same questions on repeat, “How do you know for sure that you’re not making the wrong decision? Should you really be making that decision at 18? Did any of you’re teachers or counselors try to convince you of this? Do you know that the effects of hormones are permanent? Are you sure you want to keep taking them?” And many other questions that are meant not so much to inform but to dissuade me. Not to mention the fact that if I bring up the fact that saying some of these things are hurtful my dad will tell me to be patient and that he’s just looking out for my safety. He has also stated that I must continue seeing a counselor. My mom is also pressing that I allow her to use my deadname and called me selfish when I said no and asked to be called by my name.

The third is my mom outing me to my grandma after we as a family had discussed multiple times how I wanted to come out to each person. I made it very clear that I wanted to do it on my own terms. Coming out to my grandma was also important to me because she’s very progressive and could really help in bringing my parents on-board. But my mom went and called her anyway and tried to hide it. I have refused to talk to her since and when I told my dad about it he immediately jumped to her defense without any regard for how outing me made me feel. 

I feel incredibly conflicted as my parents have shown some support like driving me to Planned Parenthood even tho they’re pro-life. But the complete lack of regard for my feeling during this process even when I have stated that I need my space has shown me a complete lack of regard for me as a person. They’re very conservative and I have grown up hearing horrible things about trans people, so it’s safe to say they have a lot of learning to do when it comes to gender. They said they would probably seek counseling so I hope that helps to understand it because they’ve deconstructed just about every article or study I’ve given to them. 

I’ve only been out to them for 2 weeks and I’m at my wits end trying to get them to support me while simultaneously avoiding the hurtful things they say. I’m at a loss about what to do with them moving forward. I move to college in August(thank fuck) but need advice about what to do about our relationship for the time being."	"ah yes, the “I’m a great parent” parent that borderline bullies their child
I'm so sorry. My Dad thinks the same way but tries at least not to say much since my Mom is supportive. Both of them don't understand it. They, much like your parents, do indeed love you and want you to be happy, but they are also incredibly stubborn. They think that we made a choice to be this way, and that we don't know what we're really getting ourselves into. I wish there was a way to get through to them. It seems like they think they know what's best, but they only know what they're used to, they think we won't be able to 'handle' all this change, when really it's them who can't handle change. It's all new to them, so be patient because it does get better. It's extremely triggering, especially hearing about your Dad's opinion on your voice. For them, support is only acceptance, not support. If they really supported you they would help you feel better instead of using every time you're feeling down about how your transition is going as fuel for what they really want, for you to detransition (they might not be direct about it, but they will use every chance they can to make you feel worse about your transition. They may not even be aware of what they're doing by doing this). Their motives for such are unknown, but it's usually because they're ashamed of you or afraid of change. For me, I just try not to talk about it to them. I'll let my actions speak for myself.

A tip on the voice. So I would just practice every single day on your own and when you talk don't try to force anything, just let your voice do it's thing. The more you practice the more feminine it will become. The more you force it the worse it will sound. Just try to talk naturally, and with practice that natural voice will sound very feminine.
I have found this doesn’t really change when you’re older. I’m 35 and get the same crap. Dad also outed me to my grown brother. There’s definitely a piece of them that wants to dissuade, there’s a piece of them that’s terrified for you, and that gets worse the more transphobic they have been in the past. I’m going the respectful but firm route. Like I respect their feelings and thoughts are real, but my gender identity is not up for debate. So I’ll be around to the extent that that’s honored. I’m just gonna be doing what’s best for me in the meantime. It’s a little different since I’m not living with them, but you can still respectfully set boundaries without being antagonistic.
I understand how you feel my father outted me as well, it really fucking sucks
I feel you. In my case my mom outed me to my whole family just before a family reunion for christmas (At least they where supportive, but I wasn't ready at all). But yeah, it's sucks.   
I was getting ready little by little to go out to my family. And what sucks more is that when I told her how wrong it was to do that, she got mad because of how I was talking to her. 

Parents sucks sometimes.
My dad said some similar things to what you said when I first came out to him several years ago. Due to my circumstances I was unable to find the medical care of hormones until recently. When I told him that I planned on starting that process, he was much more accepting than when I first came out because he saw the history of my identity. I'm not saying that it's right, but when confronted with the sudden change when coming out, most people (I have experienced) are very hesitant. Especially when they don't see the history of where that identity began for you. I hope time makes it better for you and if it doesn't then I apologize.
Yeah, my mom always says, that I'm not a guy but also not a girl and keeps telling me that she also isn't the most feminine woman. But she doesn't knows how I feel at all. Like TRY TO FEEL CRIPPLING DYSPHORIA FOR ONLY ONE HOUR AND YOU GOD DAMN WISH YOU'VE NEVER FELT IT
OP, if you need our go ahead to leave yor parents, consider this permission given.

It is not your responsibility to raise your parents. That should be on them. You are old enough to make your own decisions, so I hope that you will choose yourself. What you could give the world could otherwise be lost to us.

I wish you all the best.
It probably doesn’t mean much but you’re inspiring. You’re so strong and so brave :)
I don't know about your case sorry to hear that.

My sister outed me to my mother and my mother told me if you want to become a woman your not my son and take your things and get out of the house
And I came out to my father as bi and trans he is OK with me being bi but not trans and I e c explained to him but he don't want to understand and told me it's a sin and God will punishe you made me cry and said to me if you appearance change and you continue in his don't count me as your father.

My father can be supportive of this but the people and society iam In is Arabic and Islamic so yeah I
Apologized to my sisters and mother and told them iam not doing this anymore( transition to female)
Of course I will in secret but my mother does not believe I will stop I can feel her disappointment

She was crying every day since my sister outed me. 

Need some advice to manage this situation please.
Hey OP which state do you live in? Perhaps you can crash at my crib till you get up!
My parents are the same way. My mom actually dug through the trash to read my pill bottles. Initially, she seemed a little apprehensive but supportive. The next day she said she was afraid for my safety around strangers if I continued. Her solution was for me to stop transitioning entirely and she said it would be my fault if anything happened. Since then she’s used every excuse in the book to get me to stop. She talked about suicide and becoming an alcoholic again. Which is extremely worrying.. but she blamed it on me and me alone. She sought counseling after that.

It sounds like you’re in a similar situation. Initial acceptance leading to disregard and dissuasion. I don’t really know what to do other than point them in the right direction. I told them to seek counseling and gave them a few resources to learn more but they haven’t changed so far. I suppose just wait it out. If you need someone to talk to dm me.
I feel ur pain that hashappened to me
If it feels safe for you I think it might be helpful to have your parents read your post. After that give them some time alone to reflect on and digest what you've written.

Your post is well written, calm, and clearly lays out why what they're doing hurts you, while also being respectful of their points of view. All of those things can be really hard to maintain while you're in the midst of a conversation that, understandably, could cause you to have some intense emotions.

I probably wouldn't show them the post \*on\* reddit where they can read the comments, but copying it into a google doc or something or just printing it out and letting them know that you posted it seeking support and understanding should do fine.
Please mind language here but what the fuck is wrong with your mom, you told her how you wanted to do it and she still did that. I’m sorry but that pisses even me off
I'm going to be honest, you should just not bother with being open to them until you can get out on your own and not rely on them. When you don't live with them, when you don't need their money. Get some roommates or whatever, work, go to college, begin your transition. You don't need their approval, and if they're conservative or jerks about it, then all you're going to do to yourself is get roadblocked and put through Hell by trying to demand they accept you.

Become independent, transition, and either let them accept it after you transition or no-contact them.
My dad used to tell me he was a great dad because he let me smoke weed at his house in an illegal state at 18 whenever I tried to argue with him because he was indeed a shitty father

He blocked me on everything and threatened to kill me if I went anywhere near his house when I came out as bisexual. Now that I'm trans I'm pretty sure if he found out he would genuinely try to kill me

Any parent who holds it over your head that they're your parent and they do everything for you and let you get away with everything whenever you bring up any issue - probably a sign it's a shitty parent
Literally my whole family when they found out i shaved my legs
Thanks it’s good to know there’s someone in the same situation. As far as it goes with my voice I consistently get called ma’am over the phone and all of my friends have said it definitely sounds female. I’ve had customers at my work compliment me on how soothing my voice is. This was the first time I’ve heard anything directly negative. So when it came from my Dad it really messed with the confidence I had with my voice.
Heck yea
I hope she is going to realise how you feel.
I wish you a lot of luck and support
Damn, your childhood must have been hell. Parents are supposed to support you and be a pillow to fall on when you’re in trouble, not the piston that pushes you down onto the non existent pillow in your case
I find that the phone helps with making your voice pass. Also when you're with friends you're probably not on edge/not overcompensating. This also helps. I'm sure your voice is fem. You may have just been on edge showing him and trying too hard which I've found can sound unnatural, but more likely, Your Dad is just being ridiculously meticulous because of the reasons I stated in my original comment. Good luck with them. Happy for u that u get to get out of the house soon. It will help your mental health tremendously and you'll be able to express yourself. It's fucking pathetic that our parents actively stifle our self expression by just existing. After transitioning for a year I took a weeklong roadtrip on my own and it made me way more independent so I finally don't give a shit and express myself however I want. I think my Dad has gained a little bit of respect for me for doing so. Proves to him that I don't need his support to be myself. I mean I'd certainly like it but I don't need it at this point. I can find another father figure who actually loves the woman I clearly am.
Any tips for how you learned your fem voice? I’ve been really struggling to get mine down
Oh I'd love to tell you how hellish my childhood was but I quite literally can't remember it because of trauma ✌️😁👍

Luckily a pillow did exist when my dad pushed me away. That pillow being my fiancee and her family. I got extremely luckily and am still living with them today, two years later

Me and my fiancee plan of getting our own place this month

I'm not gonna let my shitty father affect my life now. He's a drunkard who lost his license from drunk driving and has pushed everyone away. The only reason I had to go back to living with him was because my mom died..... From literally drunk driving.... Yes he lost his license from drunk driving after his ex wife died from it... And my mom wasn't even an alcoholic and never drank. She just made a bad decision once after a hard night and payed the price - I still wonder why it wasn't my father who is constantly drunk driving that was killed instead of her (as horrible as that sounds)
Seriously thx it’s so good to see someone who has been able to show their parents that ur an independent adult who can express themselves however you want. Thanks for the reassurance and for the voice tips.
I need tips too. Haven't told anyone yet but still need it

The flair on my safety shirt		"The baphomet is so cute!!
This shirt has been with me since my days of compensatory toxic masculinity.  These days it serves as a security blanket with sleeves.  My left pocket flap has become my LGBT road map. 

I love the shit out of this shirt.

If you're interested, the pronouns and Bsphomet are from Dark Spark Decals.  I have no affiliation other than being a happy customer and a huge fan.  You can find them on Amazon and Etsy.
Where did you get that baphomet pin??? I have that sticker on my car, i didnt know they made pins aswell?
that pin is the goat
I WANT THE GOAT THING PLEASE TELL ME WHERE YOU GOT IT FROM
Awww baphomet is super cute 😊
Where did you get the trans flag Baphomet? And more importantly, WHERE CAN I GET ONE? Kitty needs one.
always luv me the baby baph <3
We need to talk about your flair.   Fifteen is the minimum, okay?  Now, you know, it's up to you whether or not you want to just do the *bare* minimum.  Or... like, Brian, for example, has thirty seven pieces of flair, right?  And a terrific smile!

We want you to express yourself, okay?  Now if you feel that the bare minimum is enough, then okay.  But some people choose to wear more and we encourage that, okay?  You do want to express yourself, don't you?
Please where can I buy the baphomet its so cute <333
Question: isn't that the *bad* lesbian flag?

I remember that the new one has 5 stripes like the trans flag, right?

I can't remember but I hink the lipstick lesbian has purple at the top and yellow at the bottom udk
Baphomet is frequently depicted as being intersexed (or hermaphroditic), and is a symbol of ""the equilibrium of opposites"", half person, half beast; half man, half woman; both good and evil; a symbol of balance and the ""goal of perfect social order"". 

https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet

Lot of trans people are into the occult 😅 Baphomet could be interpreted as a symbol for any flavor of trans, non-binary, androgyny, intersexed people, etc

And, uh... I want one of those, now, it would go great on my jacket
Thx that’s really interesting.😁
**[Baphomet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baphomet)** 
 
 >Baphomet is a deity allegedly worshipped by the Knights Templar that subsequently became incorporated into various occult and Western esoteric traditions. The name Baphomet appeared in trial transcripts for the Inquisition of the Knights Templar starting in 1307. It first came into popular English usage in the 19th century during debate and speculation on the reasons for the suppression of the Templar order. Baphomet is a symbol of balance in various occult and mystical traditions, the origin of which some occultists have attempted to link with the Gnostics and Templars, although occasionally purported to be a deity or a demon.

Not directly related to us, but Baphomet is also a symbol used by the Satanic Temple as a symbol of freedom. Their tenets include full bodily autonomy, which means the right to transition. So, a lot of women, both cis and trans have been becoming members of the temple to protect their bodies from laws invading people's home lives. 

Just to note the Satanic Temple despite its name does not actually worship Satan. The church that is the one people think of when they think of Satanism is the Church of Satan, I'd avoid those folks.
Alright I’m a Norse pagan already and don’t plan on changing religion but this is very interesting. 

Plus I’d worship Satan before I’d worshipping god. If I’m going to hell I might as well get some connections 😆

The U.S. keeps getting worse and worse I have seen no improvement.

My state of Illinois is safe and has been,

 but everywhere else seems completely screwed.  Texas is bordering on genocidal actions and Florida's banning of care for trans youth. Arkansas proposed a bill banning GAC for anyone under 26 The spike in anti-trans violence and rhetoric. So much more  Land of the free. That's a straight-up lie.  We preach civil liberty whilst oppressing large groups 

We've seen book burnings, dehumanizing rhetoric, and legislation targeting minorities before.  The 1930's in Germany specifically. Then Minority's warning of what was to come was seen as paranoia and the ramblings of the mad.  

Now trans individuals are treated much the same. Like loons and freaks. They wouldn't listen before, and they won't listen now. Sadly we must fight. Fight for our lives, lest we lose them at the hands of our oppressors.  We must fight any way we know how, but be careful. Your actions now could be used to further demonize us. Tread carefully.  Vandalise and deface the property of bigots.   Leave a message  Make it strong

Make it noticeable  


I felt I needed to say it"	"Oklahoma has a bill to ban trans care for anyone under 26. I think Arkansas' bill was for under 18. So the situation is actually slightly worse which sucks
Peacefully trying to fix things doesnt work, peaceful protests and trying to ""talk"" to nazis don't work, nazis should be afraid of being nazis

You don't progress with peacefully talking with a nazi over tea, they don't deserve respect from anyone, much less from the people they are trying to kill

(This is not directed at OP, I agree with OP's sentiment)
Dear US-based transphobes who I know are lurking here: Thank you for paying your taxes so Veterans like myself can have access to gender affirming care through the VA
I would like to add to OP's stance but add Colorado to the safe zone... we are guaranteed to control the state government for at least another decade. It's a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people. 🏳️‍🌈💯💜🏳️‍⚧️🌈👍❄️🏂🌄🤟⛰️
Basically everything I wanted to say has been said. Even as a cis person I feel scared and want to leave the country before it becomes fascist. Please arm yourselves.
We have to organize.  If we try to deal with this as individuals, we will fail, and the consequences are life and death.  I have already started implementing my exit plan from the U.S. as a contingency plan.  

I'm in a fairly friendly state, and I am planning a sizeable add on to my house in case I need to even temporarily house refugees.
It's insane that I have been telling people this will happen over and over and over and my mom after I actually shared several links over whats going on to let people know lately actually has the audacity to ask me whats wrong. The cis do not care. They just don't. It's not being talked about, it's barely being covered by them so we just do not matter and frankly it terrifies me that even if we did fight back they'd just tell us to get on the cattle cars because it's scaring them to think they would ever have to fight or be uncomfortable.

Just look how they acted when people tried to defend the drag queen bars and you would see comments saying how people with guns are just making it worse and that we would be jeopardizing everyone. We do not matter in their eyes and are only an afterthought.

The irish had the troubles, we have the concerns. Because that's all we are, a concern, a background thought. I try to be optimistic but I can't be right now.
we need to start arming ourselves and protecting ourselves a gay bar was attacked and a gay restaurant had a brick thrown at the window. this isn't new to our people but we need to start self protecting our community. the govt doesn't want to protect us the govt gang(cops) doesn't wanna protect us. it's up to us to protect each other now and im afraid as a trans woman it'll get worse
People are attempting more desperate measures against us because we’ve been making progress, and these sorts of bill (which keep getting proposed, then failing) can help open people’s eyes to the fact that those who are against us are actively trying to kill is and get them to help us. There’s one major step you can take to help: **Tell allocishets in your life about this shit, most of them don’t know, and when they do, they usually get more vocal about supporting us. They won’t fight for us, but once they realize our lives are on the ballot, most will vote for us.** Progress is being made, things are getting better. It’s just a very painful process.
In Arkansas you can drink, drive, vote, etc and do whatever the hell you want but now you’re not mature enough for GAC
America is dead to me. Honestly I don't think anything can save it. 

The worst part is the fact that the toxicity from America is spreading across the border. We've had mass shootings when shit like that never happened here. We're supposed to be better than America not sink to their level. 

At least we haven't back peddled on human rights like you all have. Yet.
I think someone said, that there aren't enough trans people to go full blown Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Movement. One would need to unite every Person under the LGBT+ Label in the U.S. And then I'm not sure if it would be enough.

Of course one could start a counter campaign. Propaganda Posters, Fake News, Fear-Mongering. Kinda using the same stuff they use to unite our people against them. But neither are we that well funded, nor do I think it would work honestly..

But the age of talk and winnning them over through discorse has ended..  it is a war, it is funded, it has a purpose and a goal..

And I don't know what can be done to counter it. Propaply getting armed? Capitalism wins again. Arm both sides and collect per bullet.

I think this will either blow over like every fear campaign has before or it will go ballistic.

In which case: man the barricades, keep the degenerates away from the trans children. We see who kills who, fascist!

I hope this wont happen.. fucking 21 century.
I'm finna grab a couple aks a couple 12 gauges, a couple 9mms and probably a.couple rugs to protect my trans sister
My wife is in prison in Florida and I'm in Oregon. We're petitioning to have her sentence transferred here because she's not safe from the guards there
Thank you! Yes, everyone is needed for unifying against this horrible political trend! It
Keeps spreading to other states and is getting more and more extreme!
With the US burning like this, is Canada truly as good as it sounds? Is that the new safe-haven for all living in the US to move to?
Eventually it'll get to a point where they'll create so many laws, that it'll box in cis people who need access to gender care for other reasons or who don't strictly conform to gender norms.
I wish I could leave but the U.S makes it nearly impossible if you aren't rich which is another issue entirely. I hate this country. ""Land of the free"" my ass.
Good luck and stay safe out there
For anyone looking to flee their state, Trans Activist and mom Erin Reed created a map that shows the best and worst states for trans people. 

[https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative](https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative)

If you’re looking to flee the US entirely, the easiest place to go would be Canada, due to the proximity of the country and also has some great protections for trans people, but there are still issues there. Do your research for where you wanna go!

Personally I live in Alabama and I plan on leaving as soon as I finish my degree.
Massachusetts is still a safe haven as is much of VT.
Personally I love trans women/men. Everyone no matter who they identify as or who they like to sleep with is a human,and deserve the same rights as anyone else. No further discussion should be needed!!!
I had to flee Arkansas last year. I was in a small, very insular town, and the amount of transphobic stuff people would spout on the daily was insane. I was in the closet, for obvious reasons, but I had to go because they were starting to sound serious in their threats of ""damnation"".
""It's a big club, and you ain't in it!""

--George Carlin
I think the problem with that strategy is it adds fuel to the fire. Nobody is going to get their shit wrecked and think ""maybe I was wrong about those people"". They'll double down, it'll end up on Fox News, etc.
I'm thankful Maryland is alright for now, though it sucks that my (thankfully cis) girlfriend lives in Texas
What’s important is that we rely on each other, and be lighter than a feather
While I agree that the US government needs to pull its head in, vandalisation and defacing of property will push those neutral to the other side of the arguement. And given that this community is tiny compared to the population, a civil war is also not the answer, especially given the power of the US armed forces. 

Any attempt at physical action like civil war will only cause those who are agressive towards this minority to believe without a doubt that they are in the right and help them convince others.

You need allies that can support you in the court of public opinion and the abilty to change an economy(thus you need large amounts of people and those who are better off economically). In other words, you need both powerful and large amounts of people to support you so the government has to listen. (Think about how segregation and racism was almost entirely eliminated, minus certain parts of the populace.)

TLDR; you will not win a civil war, think logically and politically, get as many people of all across the spectrum to side with you enough to cause a social, political and economic movement in the culture of the United States.
“Dr. King's policy was that nonviolence would achieve the gains for black people in the United States. His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: *In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.*”

~ Stokely Carmichael
IIRC, North Dakota is trying to pass a compelled speech law that forces all government-funded institutions to use the pronouns ""associated with one's sex as determined by DNA testing.""
Not American, but for some reason it seems like the west coast and north-east coast are the safest places there

Fuck the US

Goodnight   
To all see you all whenever I guess
Spreading this shit around. I want as many of us as possible to read my rant. It needs to be done
Remember that this is happening in many regions of the US  (not only in the South, as many still believe).

They want us dead
I'm in the same state, Chicago is the only widely democratic (aka trans friendly-ish) part of Illinois, the rest is redneck ass transphobic mf's. I honestly hate living in lower Illinois. [Edit: there's also hardly trans help groups in the rural areas. I feel completely lost, I hate this state, country, and sometimes the whole damn world.]
I agree that govt things r bad and things seem to be getting worse, but idk homie, “Texas is bordering on genocidal actions” seems like exaggeration to me. I’d love to see evidence to the contrary if u have it. I’m not saying things r good for us there, but I do think it’s important not to make things sound worse than they r, u know? Like Texas isn’t setting up trans person death camps or anything, they’re just fucking hella w laws that will cause death and misery, but not on a mass scale equivalent to genocide. Also, I’ve found that ppl matter a lot more than politics. Politicians can do a lot of harm, but the ppl who live around us r the ones that really affect us imo. It’s chill if I get downvoted for this, I’m just giving my thoughts as a trans girl.
I live in AR. I NEED to transition one if the reasons I quit trying to commit suicide is so I could transition. If I can't do that what reason I have to live?
I'm pretty sure Colorado is another state that is safe. I know they have protection laws for trans people.
Now is the time to get to a safe blue state. Colorado and Illinois are great options if you can't get to the coasts. At the very least, have a plan if these laws are passed. It's super expensive to move, especially across the country, but the net safety gain is well worth it.
I should probably stay up to date on the topic, but does anyone know how bad it is in Pennsylvania?
My heart breaks for my trans siblings in the us every time a new bill is announced. I'm privileged to live in a country where my rights are not attacked and I wish I could do more to help y'all.
Lots of love from your west-European sibling and stay safe
Not in the U.S., but transphobia here is pretty high as well. Being peaceful doesn't help with transphobia itself at all. It only amplifies all the narration against us, which is broadcasted by priests, gov-owned media and right-wing politicians regardless of the party. The only thing why transgenders aren't the main target is that this government is more ""concerned"" about harassing females at all, no matter whether cisgender or transgender. 

However, peaceful informing still helps with trans-friendly initiatives and spreads a word about them.
It's sadly even worse, [Oklahoma has another bill on the docket that is a de facto ban on gender affirming care. For all ages. ](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB250/2023) 

Most if not all of them will get struck down but it's scary as fuck. Seeing your own humanity debated is not a great feeling.
Damn Thanks mixed them up
Church $ at work ! Its how they network.
I can't help but be reminded of Charlie Chaplin's speech from ""The Good Dictator"". I feel like its more relevant now than ever. I wish I had a way to broadcast it to a lot of people, I would have hope that it could change some minds
Armed self defense now
Martin Luther King Jr. was both peaceful and effective.  Not being peaceful could make things way worse for us.  Our generation may not see change.  But, let's represent peace for future generations, at least.
Me too! I truly appreciate old me’s service now lol
This is what taxes should be for.
Same here, thx yall
You’re not helping.  Transphobes are morons.  Don’t do their mental labor for them.
I agree with this! While I don’t live in CO rn, I have family there and grew up there! A lot of my family since I came out has come to me and said “if you ever need to, you know you can come to us and we’ll help you.” So even if shit hits the fan in my current state, I know I’ll have somewhere safe to go. Honestly I friggin love Colorado.
Most of New Mexico is safe too.
New York is good...legally speaking. Stay out of the rural areas of course, cities are mostly fine.
Yes .Colorado is the best. I can always move back in with family in California if it gets bad here which I don’t foresee
As long has Big Gretch is office, Michigan is relatively safe as well! Especially in the Metro Detroit/Ann Arbor areas
I’ve always wanted to move there, even before I knew it’s a safe haven. Hopefully I can move there someday
Oh dang as someone in the middle of arkansas I feel terrified to imagine myself as a fucking refugee having to leave my home despite its flaws.
We have to make some noise and disrupt. You can try to ignore the elephant in the room by looking away, but not when it shrieks in your face

Or as Miles Bron, fiction’s professional idiot, would put it, we have to go past what people are comfortable with and double down
But the LGBT community is too scared of guns or any method of self defense to actually fight, so we will likely all get jailed and tortured eventually because nobody in this community is going to actually take decisive action.
You’re completely right about this! I don’t live in the US thank god, but I managed to get my dad to see how bad things were getting even in our own country just by mentioning a few examples. It’s easy to feel like the world is against us, but most people’s hearts are in the right place, they just need some help moving their brains to that place as well. Gathering allies is vital, and it’s not quite as insurmountable a task as it might seem, provided you don’t waste time on the wrong people of course
Oklahoma I messed up but they proposed a bill that would in short ban GAC for under those 26   


The scary part is I can see how it might get voted into law.
If you're talking about Canada, y'all are just as bad as us, y'all just lie to yourselves about it. You do remember any the whole ""Indigenous Women"" situation, right? And y'all are just as transphobic and homophobic too.
I love the counter campaign idea.
Look up North Dakota’s proposed SB2199. So extreme, scary and oppressive!
theres many ways to fight, you dont have to go out and literally assault someone. Nazis need to be afraid to publicly hold their ideology. period. These are people who literally don’t want us to exist.
Then we need to make any violence against us as too much for the majority of Americans. We need to stop letting them argue our existence and instead force them to explicitly come out against us.
They backed off of black people because they’re afraid.  They don’t know any language but fear.  They prove it every single day.  In their mind, if you don’t scare them then you’re fair game to target.  They only understand predators and prey; nothing else.

The first pride was a line of people throwing bricks.
X and Newton did more for civil rights than King. The suffragettes were violent too.

Nothing ever changes by peaceful protests.
Yup. Like I feel the energy but it’s just not gonna help
How can this be done you ask? Use what we have available to us, social media, a mix of kindness and maybe a bit of painting those who wish harm against  monorities as monsters(without them knowing of course). Cator to the neutral, do not be extreme, don't give those who wish harm ammunition to use against you.

There is so much more that can be done, only ever increasing with every addition to both sides.
More Kwame Ture (aka Stokely Carmichael) here https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SwEsjhxaG0Y
I hate it here
In general, yeah those are more progressive areas. The west coast has a loooot of rural and conservative area that is often overlooked however.
Same honestly  


I can't sleep at night.  
I fear what will happen if the fascists take over  
I'm there with you. When Darren Baily ran I feared for my safety  
\-\_-  
⫱  
⫱
Fuck.

I hate my GD Country  


It's getting Natzi Like
What's the speech?
I also want peace, that doesn't mean we shouldn't fight and protest

Continue on the ""just talking"" will get more and more people killed, nowhere in history people were able to revolutionize history by just having friendly talks with the people that were killing them
Also

Protesting and standing up for our rights ≠ being violent 

It just means that we need to fight for our rights, and if we are attacked by the people that want to opressor us that we need to fight against them, not quietly, not sitting down and talking, but in the streets, making noise, having our voices heard

You cited MLK, but MLK also said that he wasn't against protests and peaceful protesting was not about keeping our heads down and quietly speaking, it was about fighting for rights, screaming and walking in the streets, witouth resorting to violence 


We still need our voices heard, trying to pretend that we can talk with those people won't really help and will just make the future generation have to deal with more problems we left for them, just like the last generatio left us problems


And vandalizing the property of bigots and etc ≠ violence so
Wish people would stop repeating silliness about MLK such as this.

Keeping your head down has a time and place when someone is actively trying to harm you is not it.
This is a pretty whitewashed stance. The only reason King was able to be effective with peace was because his contemporaries were willing to use force. He was seen as the ""sensible moderate"", but even he admitted that his protests would have fallen on deaf ears had it not been for the more militant tactics of Malcom X or the Black Panthers, among others. King didn't succeed despite them, he succeeded BECAUSE of them.
Yeah, then he was shot and riots broke out forcing congress's hand to put out a civil rights act that's still allowed systemic racism to mount to this vary day.

MLK Jr. is a figure head and a focal point. Had he not been the reasonable offering versus the looming threat of widespread civil unrest, he wouldn't have been capitulated to.
Always means the world to be so accepted and loved within the community. <3 thanks friend!
We're at the point where it is not fear mongering.
I'm in Arkansas as well In the northwest part and this is all getting a little scary. I knew sanders was going to do this though. May be time to look at moving elsewhere
it might be for the best, esp for our trans brothers and sisters
I get you, I had to flee Arkansas myself last year. I know it's scary to leave but, at this point, it's getting dangerous to stay. At least set up an escape route. I'll remind you that the ""gay panic"" defense is still legal in Arkansas.
I finally managed to escape Arkansas last summer. Now living in SF and have already made it clear to several of my trans friends from back home that I would help them settle in out here.
ur right our apathy and weakness is why we are so easily pushed around
Unfortunately friend, if you don't live in the USA, you don't know how little this applies. People in the USA don't give a fuck about each other. Human life is cheap here and problems are almost always solved with bullets. And cis people do not give a single, solitary fuck. They hate us. They are not only ok with us being murdered, many of them actively want it. Even so called allies are tepid little bitches that won't do shit to help us. Most won't even show up at a protest, even with no danger to themselves. They've got their own selfish concerns. They don't care. We are entirely on our own.
We have an alt right but they're not the majority. Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.
Sure, but we would need artists for anti-right posters and the like. We could also use animators for education videos on the rising threat of naziism in the U S. Doesn't matter if it is exaggerated or not. Thats how this shit works. We would also need people who can write articels. Like when the right does something to the community, we fake news the shit out of it, just like they do with us. And then, if we want to get really dirty here, get some hackers and put smut on Ben Shepiro and Matt Walsh etc. Doxx them, hack them, get them out of the picture. One could try to take the daily wire down etc.

Basically.. fullblown transgender shadow activism.

But all of this shit would need financial funding. I don't have that kinda money. Nor would it be ethical. I don't know if we should care about ethics at this point. Thirdly it could make the situation worse by giving into the ""the wokes are attacking us"" mentality.

I don't know.

For riots we need to be united.
Me too. Standing in front of a tank without any weapon is a suicide. We have to fight, not to let them defeat us. And information war is still a war.
Unfortunately, Nazis are not afraid of anything short of physical violence. Often they aren't even afraid of that. These are scumbag, deplorable people who worship violence and murder and evil. They bathe in it. They drink it. They want to hurt you and everyone you love, and unless you're willing to put a bullet in them (assuming they attack you first and its self defense) they will put a bullet in you and think nothing of it whatsoever. And they figure, hey, if you fight back, they get to murder and beat you even harder, and then talk all about the deplorable violence of the ""trans agenda,"" while whitewashing their own mass murders and atrocities out of the picture. They engage in DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim Order. Deny that they are attacking you or that you are oppressed, attack you or your integrity, and reverse victim order to make themselves look like the oppressed victim, fighting for ""American values"" against the depraved, degenerate left. And the conservative right wing media is aiding and abetting them. Fox news and the daily wire are deplorable monstrosities who need to be punished. But there is no way to do so because they have a chokehold on the narrative about whose violence is legitimate and whose is not. AKA, Offensive violence by alt right fascist psychopaths? A-OK. Defensive violence by desperate trans folks just trying to survive to the next day? WOKE MOB. INTOLERANT LEFT.  


To be clear I am not endorsing physical violence here because it will only hurt our cause. As long as they control the propaganda machine and the narrative, neither violence nor non violence has any hope of working. The only way is to take control of the narrative first, to delegitimize their claim to legitimate violence.
We should unite. We can't work this while fractured. Do you have an idea on how we could get everyone together? A new Website, Forum, r/?
Northeast as well.
https://youtu.be/J7GY1Xg6X20
That's not at all what I'm saying.

I'm just trying to say we shouldn't resort to violence. That will only paint the targets on our backs even brighter.

Yes, talk, yes protest. But show them we do it peacefully and lovingly.
We need trans people to be a little less MLK, and a little more Malcom X.
I'm not saying that we stick our heads in the sand, at all, nor did MLK.

I'm saying let our voices AND actions represent peace as well as the disparity and discrimination we are facing.  Actions speak louder than words.  Let their own words prove them wrong by our peaceful, but vocally strong united peaceful existence
What is silly about anything I said about MLK?

I'm saying we have to fight our battles wisely, especially for future generations.  We can't get up in arms and expect them to return peace in response.
I respectfully disagree.  The militant movements were happening alongside his.  And he consistently disavowed the other approaches.  He always tried to make things peaceful.

I see what you're saying, but I sincerely don't think he levied, intentionally or not, the contrast to his advantage.

Do we really want to paint the targets on our backs even brighter?  I say we show them that we are normal, peaceful citizens, living normal, quiet lives, and let time prove we were in the right, for future generations.
MLK's life, not death, inspires many to keep pushing forward, peacefully.  His death catapulted his message to cement the inspiration, which rallies the African American rights movement forever. Whatever happened after his death, the riots, was contrary to his message of peace.

Who was more effective and represented the movement more, him or Malcolm X?  Put it this way, which person has a Federal Holiday?

Our trans community should let peaceful representation contradict the way we're being portrayed, and violence never works in the long run for ours or future generations.

As a side note, I'm shocked the mods of this thread are allowing a continuation of violence discussion on this sub.  Aren't you guys violating Reddit terms of service by allowing this discussion?

No offense at all to any of you who disagree with me.

It's just that I'd rather die a martyr and help future generations than elevate the hatred against us by resorting to violence or vandalism, and be painted as the enemy any more in the media.
Of course! I know the feeling. <3
Yeah it's getting ridiculous the closest state to me is OK and that's not any better might have to go FAR
Oof. Honestly though I really feel like alot of ignorance is bred from lack of exposure and I'd hate to have to run for my own safety I'd like to believe I could put up with any mild harassment.  Been tough finding a job though...
It isn’t weakness to care for about other people and not want to hurt them, even if they hurt you.

Edit: (written concurrently with the response about apathy) and, it’s not apathy to feel disinclined to act in a society that has shown again and again that you are individually powerless to change it.

But, we can and will and do change it, just by being here and sometimes by acting together. As gloomy as things are right now, things are happening and when I look around, I see trans people fighting. This darkness is going to have to get a hell of a lot darker to make us stop.
Sounds like peaceful methods are not an option...
Alt right isn't the majority here either, but it is a shit hole, I'll give you that.
>Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.

I remember Canadian users on here laughing in our fucking faces during the bleakest days of the Pandemic. Your countrymen are every bit as capable of being vile assholes as mine.
I mean... I'm a trans artist. I might f around and find out. But I stay off most social media, so we'd need a coordinator.
Well, you'd need something that can't be shut down easily. So an entirely new website would probably be the best bet. With decoy sites and forums here and there. Right now though, I think reddit will do the job. Also, i'd say that physical locations to talk and communicate is a good idea(although both physical and digital can be dangerous) kind of like what the civil rights movements in the 60-70-80s did.

But you also need to think about what and who you are fighting for, that way you can have true united values so the other side of the arguement can't exploit the lack of unity.
Thanks!
I'm saving this
that was great
Okay you can protest peacefully and lovingly if you want but they won't hear us, they'll laugh at us 

Because the ones in power only hear what the don't want to hear when their position is being threatened or when we make enough noise
Yes!  


Burn things make them pay hold them hostage until they see
Any means necessary.
Your complete misunderstanding and misrepresenting of Malcom X is paralleled by your misunderstanding of political power. He was a great man and doesn't deserve to have his accomplishments belittled by you because you're judging him by the standards of a white supremacist country.

This isn't about great men of history. This is about political movements. By breaking down the civil rights movements into separate figure heads and pitting them against each other, you're missing the whole. It doesn't matter wether or not the riots are what MLK stood for. No one man, moment, or action encapsulates an ever evolving political movement.

Violence against a violent system is a defense mechanisms. If the political structures around us prey upon us, it is only right that we defend ourselves by whatever means necessary. And there are going to be times when it's necessary. Self defense is never something to be ashamed of.
Right. I'm close to Oklahoma as well but I'm just down the road from Missouri.  I was actually thinking of moving to Springfield but I don't think it's going to be any better than Arkansas honestly. May have to go all the way to Colorado or Illinois. Colorado would be my first choice.
It isn't your job to educate them, you don't have to put that on yourself. At this point, they're wilfully ignorant. They know how to learn, and they know where to find information, they just don't want to. If they understood, they'd have to empathize, and they don't want to do that. They'd rather just sit in their echo chamber. If those laws pass, you're in direct danger.
that's apathy and the reason why we are so easily harassed and targeted we will never stand for ourselves if we have the whole don't fight back mentality. care about other people?? idk of u noticed this or not it's not like they exactly want us to be alive so why should we care im not gonna let someone roll over me and pretend to care about them
Peaceful is certainly preferable as all violence does is reinforce their propaganda narrative of ""trans bad."" But we also are under no obligation to stand back as a community while our people are shot to death in bars and on the streets, throw up our hands, and say ""there's nothing we can do.""

An armed guard or two at all lgbt establishments might just send the message that we're ACTUALLY serious about it never happening again.

Being trained in firearms and nonlethal self-defense for those who can, protecting each other by making sure our siblings don't walk home alone or go off with strange men with ill intent, protesting loudly and proactively! All of these tactics are necessary. Depending on our own community for protection is going to be necessary as the social conditions can change rapidly and the state doesn't always have the best interests of LGBTQIA+ folks at heart, to say the least. Only we can help us.
No we don't solve our problems but killing eachother. Unfortunately the toxicity is spreading.
If you resort to violence, you'll end up in jail.  Then, your voice will definitely not be heard, but rather used against you and us
Violence begets violence.  Period.

My comparison of Malcolm X to MLK is being misunderstood.  I don't disagree that Malcolm X was a man of recognition.  But, go ask anyone, who was more influential and effective?  I'm not misunderstanding.  I'm old and wise and know what doesn't work.

I spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm post-op trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.  Do you think I was able to do any good for our cause when I was in solitary confinement?  I had a pencil and one call a day, only to numbers I had memorized.  And, I was non-violent.  Violent people are treated way worse.  I saw it to be true of a ""neighbor"" in jail.

We should never resort to violence.  Our future generations will be the ones suffering more than us.


Again, mods, why are you not stopping all this encouragement of violence?  I'm pretty sure you're in violation of Reddit's terms of agreement.

And, to everyone else including my responder, stop encouraging violence.  I can promise, from living almost 50 years of American history, that you're painting us into a corner that we don't want!  Live for the future generations and quit misrepresenting us!

Don't be who our aggressors want us to be.  It serves us no good.
CO all the way. I still just wish things would change I live where I am by choice I moved back here after living in San Francisco, LA. Denver, some pretty open minded places. And I just love the area I'm in. :( mah home
We are already considered as bad, just for existing. 
I don't know how it looks like in the States, but here insults and radical statements aimed at minorities (incl. transgender people) are allowed by society (mostly using a mechanism of ""they are like that, we can't do anything""), but revenge measures of the same degree are considered an attack. Like we've initiated that when we are only answering to their attack. 

However, I agree.
Except when the ""problem"" is the indigenous population, in which case, it's totally normal to shove their kids into torture centers disguised as schools, where they die in appalling numbers, get shoved into mass graves, and then spend the next 100 years jerking off about how much more progressive you are than your neighbors.
When did I say we had to use violence? Please stop trying to twist my words, my comment literally says that we should protests and yell, I never even talked about being violentnagainst people

You were the one that said we should do things ""lovingly and peacefully "" wich i don't agree, because non-violent protests ≠ peaceful protests
Lmao, yeah, because it's not like the police won't raid our clubs on false pretenses if we just act nice and cordial.

I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

It's not fun. 

Your logic is broken, no offense.  They'll treat you way worse than they did me, if you resort to violence.

And violence would only work against us.  Don't resort to it.
>I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

Do you think that has more to do with you being potentially violent or you being trans?
They told me it was because I've had surgery.  

They actually had two female officers inspect my genitalia and telling me why.

It was not due to violence on my part, but my protection.  I fully complied all along the way."	10ad3x2	trans	387	0.96	2023-01-12 22:37:56
i'm sick of the arguments transphobes try to use	"There was a youtube video that was recommended to me where this (probably cishet) guy was running up to people and asking them ""what is a woman"", and many people in the video were replying with ""um idk"" (which is a valid response, if a total stranger on the street was running at me with a microphone I probably wouldn't want to answer any of their weird questions regardless of whether or not I knew the answer). All the comments were basically just transphobes jerking each other off (I couldn't bring myself to read more than a couple, but it's clear that this video was aimed at people who don't even want to *try* to understand trans issues).

&#x200B;

Like, he obviously just wants to ""prove"" that only cis people can be ""real women"", and even if he were given a valid answer that included trans people he just wouldn't accept it until he gets an answer he wants to hear.

Similarly, the other day there was this post on reddit (in one of the trans subs, don't remember which), where op asked what a woman was. I commented ""a person"", because I thought that was a good enough answer, then the guy goes on to say ""nO YoU nEeD ChRoMoSoMes"" and other BS like that. I thought he genuinely wanted an answer. Who the hell even does that? Making a post pretending to want to learn more then just turning down every good answer you get (not saying my answer was the best out there, but I know for sure women would rather be seen as a person than just a meat sack with chromosomes).

&#x200B;

**I'm tired of womanhood being reduced down to breasts and vaginas**, it's perverse and dehumanising. I'm not even a woman, but as someone who has lived as a woman for about 2 decades (give or take) it makes my blood boil. I've even seen accessories, jewelry, and even **Christmas ornaments** made in the shape of a vulva for the sake of ""feminism"". It's fucking vile. I don't understand why any sane woman would feel ""empowered"" wearing a pair of clitorises on her earlobes. I mean, isn't feminism supposed to be about women being worth **more** than just their body?

&#x200B;

I don't know what I would do if I had to deal with one of those lunatics if I were openly trans. Even if I knew what to say, even if I had the *perfect* comeback to every little argument they put together, they won't stop until I give up and go back to being the wonderful fuckable little girl they would want me to be. No transphobe truly cares about women's safety in public bathrooms, or fairness in sports, or whatever the Bible says, they just want to use every excuse they can hurt people they don't understand - people they don't even *try* to understand."	"This is why when someone asks, what is a woman, I just say “me”.
To the point of wearing vulva's , like I can appreciate it in the sense that it's also about reproductive rights and giving people agency about how they want to express their sexuality and going up against shit like the existence of the clit being denied etc. And as a trans woman it doesn't inherrently make me feel excluded

But yeah it's creepy as fuck when terfs reduce women to wether someone can birth children or be sexualized. They'll even say shit like "" breasts that have never known a lovers embrace"" with a straight face.
I actually try to answer this question on my tumblr 
https://transitorri.tumblr.com/post/679641495597383680/its-a-box-with-nothing-in-it

Let me know how I did or if you have other topics you want me to try and tackle
It’s the Ben Shapiro tactic. It’s where you target people who are unprepared, ask them leading questions until they get flustered, and then declare yourself the winner. It is perfect for conservatives because it beats all the complexity out of politics and turns it into clichés, which is all their ideology is.

btw The best response I’ve come up with to “what is a woman” is “a socially constructed category”
I get wearing accessories or using Christmas ornaments with vulvas, vagina, uteruses etc.  it’s because those body parts are kind of taboo to discuss because of misogyny.  Like, there are huge gaps in our medical knowledge about these organs just because they are “girl” organs and sexist doctors didn’t want to study them because they were “indecent”

That said, I agree mostly with what you say.  These people claim ti be protecting women, but what they are doing is objectifying women in service of policing our genders.
I'm intersex so i identify as whatever gender i want when i want although i prefer more feminine with occasionally going out in non binary mode, i have difficulties passing as male anymore because of the hormones.. I don't understand how you can be transphobic without also being freedomphobic and more, These haters make no sense and i feel sorry for them.
I think I got recommended the same vid. Was it by a guy with a beard and brown hair?
[deleted]
And I'm tired of womanhood / manhood being things altogether
I don't see how ""a person"" is a valid answer to ""what is a woman."" To me it would sound like a smart ass remark considering... every other person is ALSO a person. Being a person is not what makes a woman a woman.
What about people like Bailey Jay?
She is a woman with a penis, so what?
For me, Bailey Jay is a woman and not a man.

It's so ridiculous because:
Without knowing the genital - if people see a transwoman with a feminine voice and a curvy, feminine body in the streets, they surely would think that the person is a woman right?
Feminism stands for equality between both genders.

It has absolutely nothing to do with femininity, despite the name implying that. You dont see any dick decorations for christmas, so that in itself is unequal and the opposite of what feminism is.

These transphobes are too similar to a Christian trying to communicate with an aethiest. Aethiests are the open minded, progressive, critically thinking ones and the Christian's are the close minded, ignorant ones keeping society from developing. 

Change Christian to transphobes and aethiest to transgender and the same can be said.

I know like terfs objectify women in so many degrading ways.
That was a really detailed post. I really loved how you set everything out so eloquently. I was wondering if you had such a response for people who go >!""gender is defined by the genitals you're born with""!<? I've never been able to counter that argument head on (they see intersex people as exceptions to the rule and therefore don't break it entirely).
This was excellent, thank you!
I really learned from this post. You articulated things better than I could have. 

An idea you might consider adding, and I doubt I could say it as well as you: The conservative folks who need to focus on gender assigned at birth conveniently ignore the babies born intersex or those with ambiguous genitalia. It's not a huge number, but it's not zero.
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage. This is not a difficult issue.

Yeah i think so!
It was a pretty short video too, like it was a trailer for something
>""There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't be lgbtq""

Leviticus 18:22 is pretty straightforward. 

Genesis 1:27 is pretty clear God only created two genders.

Deuteronomy 22:5 actually says crossdressing is abhorent.

1 Corinthians 6:18-20, Galatians 5:19-21, Ephesians 5:5-6, do I need to keep going?


1 Timothy 5:20 ""As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear""

So the Bible is actually very clear that being gay or cross dressing is a sin, and the Bible also tells us to not associate with those who would live in unrepentant sin.

It's possible to Love your neighbor and acknowledge the fact they're living in perpetual sin.
It might be a bit smart aleck-ey but it is an important thing to assert. These arguments about definitions of “what makes a woman a woman” have a bad reductive tendency to leave out anything that isn’t strictly unique to women, including basic stuff like “personhood” (and by extension the rights, privileges, and respect that personhood confers).
It's not productive though to sort Christians and Atheists as good and bad. There's some dick close-minded Atheists and there are open-minded Christians. I see your point but not a good comparison.
Not all Christians are bad yk. I loathe people who bring religion into arguments about PEOPLES RIGHTS in ANY way. They aren't related. End of story. Some people can be close minded atheists. Like you.

(Sorry for getting so heated I'm just done listening to this bullshit rhetoric.)
okay. if a woman gets a hysterectomy does that make her a man then?
Women don’t need wombs to be women

Trans women are women
It’s not a wrong answer
If they dismiss the reality of intersex people (who, by the way, make up a larger portion of the population than redheads do,) in favor of their mythical idea of a perfect binary, they’re beyond help, I’d say.
You can't reach everyone is going to be the first thing, if they're super committed to being stubborn and refusing to entertain new ideas then you're talking to a wall. If however, they're sincerer and open minded, the tact I've been toying with lately, is say there's a young man, he goes off to war, while there he's injured, his genitals are mutilated during an explosion, he comes home, gets reconstruction, but elements of his leg and genitals are completely gone. 

Is he not a man anymore? If he's not than what is he? If he is, then why is he still a man? He has no genitals any more? Is it because he used to be a man? So, he still gets to be a man? If that's the case then his genitals aren't the factor that made him a man, because those are gone. 

In a case like this, I want the goal to be on the other person setting the boundaries and trying to define that grey space, put them back on the defensive because often people with this mentality like to take the offensive posture, make sweeping ill defined statements, and make you keep answering their inane questions. Instead, if you can push it back on them by appearing open minded and asking them to nail down the grey space, you can point out all the fuzzy edges in their position instead of constantly being on the defensive. This puts you back in control of the discussion.

The LGBTQ community is fine with grey space, spectrum and scales, we believe they exist, you can be man, woman, both, neither, other, we're fine with this. Make the person who claims those ranges don't exist draw the line in the sand and then attack that line by blurring it at each step, until they acknowledge there's so much ambiguity it can't be easily defined.

At least, that's how I'd try to tackle it if I thought the person was worth the time.
I have mixed feelings about using intersex individuals as pawns in the debate for gender, it also focuses the discussion back to anatomy, which I think is a dead end, or at least outside of what I was trying to hit there. Maybe I should try address that in another post. One focused on biology and anatomy.

The point is really to get away from the anatomy arguement entirely because so little of ""gender"" is tied to parts that we hide with clothes.

People like to hide their transphobic argument in anatomy, but, you show cishet men pictures of vagina having, hairy, strong, bearded transmen (picking on that group, cishet, because they're the biggest offenders) and they aren't turned on.

Why not? If they believe people are nothing more than walking penises and vaginas, well, what's the matter? Not uncomfortable are you? Likewise, if people are nothing but their parts why do they have standards for dating at all, wouldn't one penis or vagina be just as good as the next?

The argument they cling to is flawed at the premise.
Good Ben Shapiro bot
Yeah we've definitely seen the same video. I looked through his channel out of curiosity after the trailer. He made a video about ""woke oreo cookies"". I think that about sums up how pointless his channel is 😂
Mate, the whole Bible argues that everyone sins, and it's exceptionally wild to throw stones using the Bible as a launching pad. 

Also, no disrespect to Christians at all when I say - why should anyone give a shit what your take on it is?
Galatians 3:28 - ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""

&#x200B;

God created wheat and grapevines, but He does not condemn us for turning them into bread and wine. God has blessed us with the ability to change, create, and grow. If it is in His will for someone to grow into a gender different to one they were assigned at birth, who are we to deny His will?

&#x200B;

Also please don't take Bible verses out of context - just because certain verses *could* be used to argue against transgender people doesn't mean that's what it truly means. It's a sin to re-write the Bible to have meanings that fit your own prejudices.  
Revelations 22:18-19 ""**I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.""**

Deuteromy 4:2 ""**You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you.**""

Doesn't mean there is NONE though.
you do realise more than two types of chromosomes exist right?  
also how the hell are you supposed to tell which chromosomes a person has? do you carry around a freaking microscope and a blood test so you can make sure every woman you find is a ""real"" one?

shove off mate
there are also people with xxy and xyy chromosomes, honestly if you do a quick google search you'll realise how ridiculous your chromosome ""argument"" is.  


Not to mention there have been **numerous** cases of people who were born women with xy chromosomes, and born men with xx chromosomes. again, fucking google it
?
No doubt about that, same can be said for aethiests.as far as I've seen theres no open minded Christian's in my area so I dont have any contact with the other kinds

My dad is sending me threatening messages and I'm scared for my safety	"So um the other night I (22MtF) went out presenting as female in public for the first time and had an amazing night in my first gay bar.
But the next morning I woke up to some messages from my dad which were very threatening (for context, he is a very horrible toxic person who has lost everykne close to him through abuse and alcoholism, he asked me if I was gay on my birthday 2022 and I said yes but diddnt mention that I'm trans because he is already extremely homophobic and we was on holiday on the other side of the country for my birthday, and that went horribly, I had to get across England back to London on my own becquse i basicly got forced to leave after the first night and then he spent the next 2 weeks harassing me and ended in getting me kicked out of the flat I was living in because it was a relation of my dads. And since then I've not really spoken to him), so that all happened last September and about 2 days ago I got these texts, saying ""you horrible little c**t, this is all your fault, your putting the blame at my door when it's your problem"" or so thing too that effect, then responds with ""you forget I know alot of people in (my area), see you soon"".

Since then I've greatly feared for my safety as he has a history if violence and has some dangerous connections and I don't know what to do and cant even leave the house.

Sorry for rant just need some kind of support or advice or somthing.
I'm thinking of going to the police but I'm just really scared of how far it'll go."	"Definitely contact the police if you think it's safe to do so where you live.
Ah, I believe you can make a report , basically as evidence, and ask them not to contact the other person, and tell them all of this.
Insist that Police file a police report. They don’t have to question your Dad or make it known that there was a report filed, but this is necessary to establish a pattern of harassment. Document every interaction you have with your Dad, keep all text messages/emails. Save any voicemails and/or record any audio recordings. Where I live in Canada only one party (of a conversation) needs to be aware of a voice recording for it to be legally admissible in a court. Not sure how that differs in the UK but cover your butt, and STAY SAFE. I’m soo sorry you’re having to go through this😥
Remember, just because he’s family doesn’t mean anything if he can’t accept you for you. Do what you have to do to be happy and survive. If that means reporting him to the authorities then so be it. If it means cutting him from your life then that’s one less trauma you have to endure. If you need to move away for your safety then I’ll help with bus fare. Your life is more important than the bonds of someone that can’t accept you as you. You got this hon. 💜💜💜
talk to the police, pursue a restraining order.
Police and a lawyer.   
Would also recommend asking in r/transgenderUK if anyone knows a trans support group where someone could accompany you to the police. Maybe they even have connections to lgbt-friendly lawyers.    
Save any threats he makes and ask a lawyer how to preserve them, so they could be used in court. (Just in case).  

Since your father is that type of criminal, would also recommend breaking up contact with him. The less he knows about you or your whereabouts, the better.
Do you have any weapons? Hopefully it won't come to that but it sounds like you're in a really dangerous situation
Save those texts and file a police report.
From you mentioning England I’m gonna guess your in the uk. It’s illegal to threaten someone. And as they’re text messages you can just give them to the police and they’ll deal with him, although he might get slapped with a charge. So depends on whether or not you wanna burn that bridge permanently, although from how you describe him I don’t think you’ll be loosing much.
Let law enforcement handle him. Steer clear of him and realize he's not being a parent but a bigoted bully. You are of legal age to be yourself.  Huge hug from a Detroit girl whose Dad hit her when he was high on cocaine. Wanna know why I became a black belt? Self defense training is one reason I can stand tall as a woman and at least try to give you sincere advice.  Please please learn how to defend yourself, that's not a ""boy thing"" to do!
CALL THE POLICE, keep a paper trail, take picture of everything he sends you, and record calls if possiable (or just dont answer them). 

COVER YOUR ASS, make sure there is no question as to who is at fault in any sort of legal proceedings

Also get a restraining order immedietly, if he messaged you that you have the proof you need.
Splash pics of him online alongside of the pic of the threat
I have no advice, just love and support
Who are these people he's going to send after you? For someone to actually commit an organized hate crime like that they need more motivation than just some guy telling them to go assault someone. The odds of you getting jumped by someone I'm sure is very low. But you know your dad and I don't, I'm just saying there's more that goes into it then just threats.
I live in London - I'm trans (nonbinary) and live in a queer house with my partner and flat mate - I know I'm a stranger but if you ever need some boots on the ground support nearby please do feel totally free to get in touch <3
Move. Get a restraining order.  Leave.  Go!
Please, please make a report. Being in these types of relationships, he probably knows fully well he scares you. So he thinks you won't tell anyone. You need to make it known. I've gone as far as to send these types of messages to trusted family and friends in case something happens to me.You need to screenshot or save all the messages he sends you. Personally, I would move into a shelter if you can and go no contact for your mental health. Also, I'm the momma of a trans daughter, and I wanna say I'm super proud of you for being your authentic self. 💓
Is there a hotline you can call to talk through your options and see what support might be available? Because you're related, it might be considered domestic violence in which case you might be able to get a free hotel. Even for a night to feel safe and sleep can make a huge difference. I've been stalked before and it's a terrible feeling to feel trapped. Try to make a safety plan. Is there anyone who would believe the seriousness and go with you if you need to get out for safety? I've had meh to terrible experiences with the police and court systems in the USA personally, it really depends on what feels like the right choice to you. More people knowing about the situation is better IMHO, neighbors, family, coworkers, etc.
i’m not sure if there are different laws that apply over there. but arm yourself. purchase a small knife or switchblade or something if you don’t already have one. i’d also recommend investing in some pepper spray of some kind (again, if you can)

you aren’t gonna be bullied into being someone you aren’t. you sure as shit aren’t gonna get assaulted by your own blood’s goons because you dared to “defy” him. stay safe love.
I diddnt expect such a huge response from everyone, thank you everyone for all your support its made me feel safer knowing people care ❤️
I am so sorry. Get a knife or a gun and keep in 2s. Buddy system and just be aware of your surroundings. Text him back that you've shown these threats to the police and if anything happens to harm one hair on your head the police will go see him first and foremost. A little but effective bluff.

There is nothing I can contribute to the safety aspect unfortunately except that you do need to go to the police and preferably also get professional advise from people who work in areas of domestic violence and violence within families. 

But please understand that your dad said this to you in other words: “I do not love you unconditionally. I do not care about the person you are. I only care about how I  look and what people think of me. You are only a status symbol for me not a person.” Your dad clarified for you that he needs to be cut out of your life to keep you safe from abuse even if the physical threads turned out to be unfounded. You don’t deserve ANY kind of abuse.
Thank you for all your support girls it means alot to know my sisters are here ❤️ 💗
Wow, that’s really scary! I agree with what others have said—file a police report to get his abusive/threatening behavior on record. I don’t know about where you live, but it might be worth your time to look up any domestic violence agencies in your area. They can often provide support as well as guidance.
Move to any place with lots of people from afar, if he's a true British man he won't go anywhere near there (cause they're xenophobic)


Jokes aside, mode outta the country if it gets bad
This is awful. I hope everything turns out alright and you find the peace and safety you deserve.
You safety is critical. You might search for a LGBTQIA shelter or advocacy organization that can guide you toward legal protection. If no time and anything escalates, call 911 for help. I am so sorry. You should not have to live in fear.
The best thing I can say is try to pursue a restraining order against him and if you can, move. I know that doesn't help too much but it's the best thing I can say. Regardless I wish you the best and send my support 💜
Wow that's horrible, I hope you have several ways to cut contact from him off entirely. Phone, social etc. I'd suggest trying to make a fresh start and let him wallow in his hatred and anger on his own.
If you need someone to unload and talk to about things to ease your burden feel free to DM me, my mother is anti lgbt and threw me out at Christmas in the middle of COVID restrictions after years of psychologically abusing me this was after previously trying to live independently but after 10 years was forced return home due to financial problems brought on by a recession when i lived 300 mile away from her as she had acted supporting of me i gave her the benefit of the doubt that she had changed.
I’m so sorry your patriarchal biolog is evil, but most are. Most cis gen males are only good for their seed and labor anyway. Just look at feral cats, the males get the girls pregnant, and then go on their way.
Personal protection at ALL times, always be prepared. Notify the police immediately and see if you can be put under any protections and it’s safe to assume this is an appropriate situation to file a restraining order, I also recommend a security system or deadbolt. Enable sos on phone and invest on one of those loud keychain alarms incase you ever end up being followed.
Definite police report - include all the threats.  Ask about a Restraining Order though you would want to be in a safe place when that gets communicated.  Do you have friends you can stay with on short notice?  If possible reach out to a few folks and see if you can set that up.  Can you block his number / email etc. so you just don't receive these horrific messages?  I am so sorry this is happening to you.  He does not deserve you and you will find your own adoptive family.  Take care hon,
File for a restraining order. Give them as much evidence as you can. Do not let up until you receive the order.   
I would also petition your local housing authority for assistance in making your home safer or relocating to a safer area.
Problem with criminal connections, the grapevine is continuous. I would not contact the police. I'd get the hell out of England. Think of friends outside of your area. EU has many options. If that is not feasible at the moment, be sure to stay in groups of people as much as you can. Different looks. It seems like a pivotal time, journal about what you want to do and think of an action plan. Flight > Fight
File a restraining order against him. Put your safety first!
Seek asylum?
I know it’s much harder in the UK, but try your damndest to buy a gun.
If you can, install a camera to watch your buildings exit. And make a habit of checking it before leaving.

If possible harden the door into your apartment, and have something heavy to block your bedroom door. Have a useful defensive item (like a baseball bat, or something else that won't get you in trouble) next to the door and next to your bed.

Mix your movement times and places, prefer places with enough people and police presence, be wary of where you move in the times when there are fever people around, try to use uber or taxi to move through areas you think are more risky.

If you assume that the physical risk is from stabbing, buying a tourniquet and some haemostatic  dressing, and getting the basics on how to use them(YouTube, guide, if possible a course), might not be a terrible idea.

If there is an emergency service app in the UK with stuff like speed dialing, location sharing etc. getting it might be a good idea. 

Also call the cops, live your life and hopefully things get better! Good luck.
I want to but its the fact that he knows where I am now and I think ill be in danger if I report anything but I can't move out either.
Thank you for your advice hun :)
Thank you hun, yeah I've kept everything text so far so I've got alot of evidence dating back to september
Only a sharpened screwdriver but it'll puncture easily enough
You're right though, I won't be losing much
I think that's why I'm hesitant
Aw thanks hun, I actually used to practice BJJ and used to teach the kids classes in my teens, I loved it so much it was a great outlet for me, one of the highlights of my life is sparring with Joyce Gracie (grandson of the original creator of Brazilian Jiu Jitsu).
I was gonna start training again a couple years ago but I've dislocated my left knee too many times and got Oscar shlatters (idk the spelling) in both knees so it's very hard to continue.
I'm so sorry to hear about your dad too x love from London <3
The love and support is much appreciated from everyone love ya all xx
You seem to massively underestimate what hate does to people. If they are filled with enough hate, just give them a target to unleash it on and they will do a lot of fucked up things. Don't forget that in their mind, it's usually the right thing to do.
My dad has alot of criminal connections so I'm kinda worried that someone will be sent.
It doesn't cost much here to get someone ""sorted out"".
Thank you so much, I'm based in East London, what about you? <3
Thank you for your kind words hun <3
I've told 2 of my housemates and my mum and they would help me get somewhere hopefully
If I carry something in public and get caught ill probably get a worse sentence than my dad would for the actual abuse so ill have to tread lightly <3
They are in London so I don’t think they’ll be able to get a gun
I've been considering it actually
Thank you hun x
Thank you hopefully it doesn't last too long:)
Thank you :)
Yeah I've blocked him on my phone and stopped using Facebook and deleted anyone who might have contact with him from all my socials so hopefully I can escape
Yeah I've blocked him on my phone and stopped using Facebook and deleted anyone who might have contact with him from all my socials so hopefully I can escape
I'm so sorry to hear that hun I hope things get better for you, feel free to message me anytime x
Thank you for the ideas :)
Not really got anyone I could stay with near me but maybe a few county's away possibly.
Thank you for your support x
I can try but I'm new to how housing works as this is the first time I'm living ""alone"" and dealing with that kinda stuff
That won't be possible in the city without dealing with unsavoury people if you know what I mean.
Thank youu 💓
This is why he's threatening you. He thinks if your scared you won't do anything giving him the freedom to do what he wants. Call the police.
Why does a report put you in danger?
Why can’t you move?
I know my situation was totally different from your’s, but I once had an abusive ex who started to jokingly send me threats. I took them as jokes but I knew a part of him was serious. My friends told me to report it, I didn’t think they’d take me seriously, but they said it was very serious and they were glad I came in. 

Of course every police encounter is different. Police can be horrible and we know this oftentimes more than most people. But from what you’re saying about the messages, you could potentially get a restraining order of some form. 

Not sure where in particular you live and I’m not certain it would work but I wish you luck. (also I’m in midwestern US)
Play the long game, start planning to get out of town and disappear.
If I were you I'd get a ball-peen hammer, or a D-cell flash light, long kind, might as well be a mace really. The problem with knife fighting, or shank fighting in this case, is that it takes a lot more skill to do it effectively and not get disarmed. The norse used to consider anything under seven inches an ""Eating knife"" because it wasn't nearly the threat something a foot or longer was. At that point you can start slicing stuff off. 

The other problem you'll run into is as I understand it The Met takes a dim view on edged weapons of any sort, particularly if it's sharpened you might survive the encounter but land in a worse situation.

 Clubs are the easiest thing for people to master after spears. Get training if you can, PM me and I'll try and shoot you some links you might find helpful. I did security for the better part of the decade and martial arts since I was 12. The main thing is detecting danger, but particularly if he's sending multiple people after you, you need to learn every dirty trick in the book. There was no human being I couldn't take down with 4-5 people, it was only a question of how much trouble they could cause on the way down. 

London isn't them most transgender friendly place but you have a community over there, if you reach out you may be able to find some resources and go into hiding until you can find a more permanent solution. I don't know much about this personally but I've heard there are countries that will take transgender folks as asylum seekers.
After reading this, we know who the horrible little c word is in this situation, and it's certainly not you.

Fuck him!
Girl, I’m gonna say this once. It’s his fault for being an alcoholic looser who thinks it’s fine to threaten his closest family. And by the sounds of it he may be a danger to others considering he doesn’t strike me as the most stable of people. You’d be doing your family and the general public a favour.

Harshness aside, if you need to talk my dms are open. Even if you just need someone to vent to I don’t mind.
To you also!
Yeah, he's got quite a history of violence too so I know he could and would
Southeast! Lewisham :)
question: how are the pepper spray laws over there? i live in the states and i know in some states, spray is considered a weapon and you need a permit, but for others it isn’t the case
I've been through a similar situation.
It's going to be difficult. No part of this is easy.
Do what you can to gather the information you need. If you have internet at home, Google your local assistance programs.
If you don't have internet at home, go to a local library. 
If you think, ""there probably isn't any kind of help for this or that."" You may actually be surprised.
You can do this.
He can send people after me
Mainly because I cannot even afford the rent where I live now and I'm getting a cheaper deal because the landlord is a freind of my mum and her bf.
Also I have people who help me out quite alot here and I don't think I'd make it on my own somewhere else.
I'm gonna look into it cos it might be different cos I'm in London, England
Thank you hun <3
I'm around Ilford/Dagenham
I'm not sure I'll have to look into it some more but that is a good idea thank you
Thankss :)
Sounds like he's said he'll do that already. Just make sure you impress on the cops that this is an active situation and that if they're going to question him he better not get near a phone without supervision, because he could send the text that gets you killed
Not to make you even more scared than you are, I do apologize if this makes you more scared. But it sounds like he’s already been doing awful shit to you. People like him often escalate when they don’t get what they want (what he wants sounds like you to be cishet and you aren’t that). You will have no protection if he ends up doing something again or doing something worse if you don’t get the cops involved.
If you talk to the police and make syre he knows you talked to the police then he wont be able to do anything. He'll know that if something happens to you he's the one they'll come after first.
Join the military. Its not always the most the trans friendly environments but will cover all surgery needs and will get you away from your dad. Also a huge help financially.
Well, thats not too far- seriously, if there's anything another Londonder can do, get in touch <3
and this sounds incredibly diy, but if you are otherwise unable to carry pepper spray? carry perfume. it isn’t nearly as potent obviously but it does some mean pain when applied to the eyes. plus all that abundance of chemicals at once is disorienting. so it would give you at least a stalling point to run away
Definitely don’t do that. Unless u wanna be surrounded by a bunch dudes like ur dad. The military has a massive history of homophobia, transphobia, and sexual assault 🥴🤢
Not a great idea when we are staring down world war 3, unless that’s what they want to do with their life.  The military seems like a fine choice in times of peace, but nobody wants to get shot at for medical care, not worth it
This depends on where you live but I agree if your out of options join the military especially in the US they will take you in find you something your good at and not only keep you safe but teach you how to defend yourself. 

The moment I’m able to that’s what I plan on doing
Thank you so much :) <3
Thats a good idea thanksss x
You mean world war 3? And you can choose peace jobs or even be in the coast guard. No need to hate when I am offering a possible option
I got shot at because it got me out of the foster care system. But I choose Marines you don’t have to go front lines plenty plenty of stateside non deployed units and jobs. Most the military is support.
Supporting murderers, no thanks.  War is horrific and ending it needs to be higher up in priorities for humans
War is horrible and unnecessary but it’s unfortunately a necessity because not everyone thinks that way.
I live in the us which builds lots of weapons and provokes conflicts all over the world.  Maybe you live in an actual decent country with an honorable military.  The US military exists to make conflicts worse so they can sell more weapons.  Nobody should take part in that
I agree with that. All i did was offer her an option and you jumped down my throat though. Looks like she lives in the UK
I just don’t want to see anyone roped into war just to get medical care, sorry about jumping down your throat, I just feel passionately about it, the military exploits people in these positions unfortunately"	128bup8	trans	317	0.98	2023-04-01 05:03:02
Think about coming out to my parents.	"Hi all, this has been weighing on my mind for about 7 years (I’m 22) and I’m posting here for some tips or advice.

So for some context my parents are super conservative christians that are very transphobic. I’ve moved out of home and have started HRT without their knowledge. My birthday is soon and they want to visit me. I’m 6months in my transition and I’d say its getting obvious that I’m “visibly trans”.

I’m considering doing it over text since I’m semi-scared for my safety and I’m not emotionally ready to deal with any negativity in person. 

All of my friends, coworkers and places I have to interact with know I am trans and I am in a much better place. Its just my family in general… only my sister knows and she is supportive. 

Idk what else to say, thanks in advance from a nervous girl"	"I am a 32 year old who is about to transition. I came out to my conservative Christian parents 2 years ago. The result was frustrating and I wound up returning to the closet briefly. Since then I have come back out to close friends and more recently my parents again. The result this time was better, but I don’t know that I expect my parents to really ever be totally okay with this. I will be alright if they can just tolerate me, which I am very hopeful for. I just can’t believe that I halted progress on my transition for two years over fear of not being accepted. The real key is accepting yourself and accepting that others might not be capable of it, and that is okay. You can’t pretend to be someone you’re not just to make others happy. People who truly care about you will likely come around in time, but you won’t be the one to change their minds. They have to be the ones to do it.
I have not come out to my parents yet(MTF 35); my plan is to come out to them in early November ( I should be on hormones for 4-8 weeks by then). My plan is to send an email explaining how I feel, what this means, some expectations, boundaries and links on how to be an ally. I know this seems a little impersonal but it will also help me convey and make sure I get across all the points and not in the momment forget or ve over powered by them. I am putting that they can call me and talk but it will give them some time to recover and collect their thoughts before they have the react in the moment and say something stupid. My parents are fairly liberal politically but belong to a conservative religion (Mormon) so how they respond to someone not their child versus their child can make a difference.
if you're scared for your safety then definitely break the news from afar. texting seems wrong or maybe I'm too old. lol. just me but if I was concerned about possible violence I'd break the news with a phone conversation. when I came outit was the most terrifying thing I've ever done especially with people who I cared about. be strong be true to you. living your best life in a way that's right for you is worth it.
if it's important to you to preserve your relationship with your parents one piece of advice I'd give is to be prepared to let them behave badly at the first reveal. the storm may pass if it's not escalated at that moment allowing a more reasonable discussion later. just remember you're advocating for your true self be strong immovable and let the bad behavior pass at first. time enough in future to argue if they continue
If your visibly trans I think it’s time you break it to them

I’ll be in this situation soon as well, so GL lol
Be patient with your parents. As a mother it’s a HUGE change. I think once they see how much happier you are, I think they will see that. I did! My child (20yo) MTF seems more at peace and I’m so happy! I’m still adjusting though!
Good luck to everyone here who hasn’t, for whatever reason, come out to their parents yet.

As a parent (41f) , I love my son (11 AFaB) with all my heart. I will always support him and advocate for him whoever he is.  I know that is not the case for a lot of you.
I just want you all to know, however your story goes, there are always people who will love you and support you. You need to make your own life, be happy, and be yourselves.

Good luck xx
I'm sooo happy for you. you sound very grounded and you'll be  fine. I've been out everywhere (except to my senile mom) for a little over 2 years best thing I've ever done but there are still problems just cones with territory. I'm mulling over my course of action for some misgendering at work right now. I work at a transmedicine clinic believe ot or not and some people still insist on misgendering. amazing. anyway I don't wanna get them fired so trying to develop a strategy for dealing with it.all that's neither here or there but just saying it's a process that goes on and on but so worth it
don't feel too sorry for me I have great accepting work environment everybody should be so lucky. just spoiled a little I guess. good luck take care of yourself
Text is great! I came out to someone I felt emotionally unsafe around through text and still had a panic attack afterwards, so be prepared that things can still feel bad. But it will definitely be safer than in person. You don't owe anyone anything during this process.
i suggest turning it into something they may understand. maybe phrase it as your being transgender is god’s way of allowing you to explore yourself and be happy
If you’re independent I’d say go for it.  I haven’t spoken to my family in 5+ years and I’m better off for it

Either your family will support you or not.  If they don’t, it’s their loss.  If they do, great!
I'd say do it over text and then lay some ground rules and boundaries too. Be prepared to have to cut them out of they're awful about it
If you sister is supportive then ask her to be there for/with you when you tell them. When I told my parents I was alone and my sisters said they would have been there with me if I knew I was going to tell them. Rally who you can. 

When I told my Conservative, Catholic parents they gave me lip treatment. “Well we can accept you but it’ll be hard for us” and “but you were such a handsome man”. I finally had to put my foot down some months later and said they can either have me as a woman in their lives, or not be in their lives at all. That was the make-it or break-it moment for them, and they realized I was serious about my decision. I think I shoulda started out with that when I came out lol. 

I’d just start preparing for what they will say. My assumption is that it will mostly be god-related stuff. “God made you a man” to which I’d reply “no, he made me a woman in a mans body.” “God doesn’t make mistakes” and reply “then theres nothing wrong with me being trans because he made me this way.” Just kinda do this debate in your head so you can work out your answers. 

Another big point is to talk about how trans has been around throughout so many eras of human history. They might be ignorant of world history, but it’s still a really valid point to shake up their transphobic views which I’d assume is mainly them thinking this is just some new gay movement beginning in the 1990s-2000s

I hope it goes well if you do tell them! 

Also I assumed you were AMAB because of the nervous girl remark, I’m sorry if my assumption was wrong.
You can try to get them into lgbt churches. Then they might change their mind or be nicer without feeling like ""their Religion is taken away"" or something.
Ok so here's my thoughts as a women with a child that is part of th lgbt community if ur parents cant get with the 21st centry and out of the old ways then thats there problem not urs I'm a former cathic and Christian I believe that god has a plan for all not just some my thoughts r christians have things backwards and god loves u all even more for being who he wanted u to be not what everyone else thinks.
I'm a trans guy who came out to my parents in my mid twenties. They are also conservative christians. I honestly thought I was prepared for coming out to them when I did. I had done my research. I knew all the 'right' things to say or direct them to in order to help them understand. I was an adult, who had the respect of an adult, and the ability to distance myself from them without legal or physical harm if needed. All that wasn't enough, though. If anything, we just re-hashed the same arguments I had as a teenager when they found out I wasn't christian. 

Do what feels best for you, first and foremost. You don't need to put yourself in harms way (including mental harm) for anyone. But if you want them in your life, and you want to try and speed up acceptance...you do have to talk in their language. Which sucks, since you will have to do most of the work here. It's like trying to explain a cellphone to someone from an ancient civilization. Even if you don't have the language barrier, there is still the knowledge barrier. To make them understand, you have to use stuff familiar to them. 

There are some resources out there for trans christians that you can look into to use. That, along with scientific studies about quality of live for trans people who can transition and are accepted vs those who can't or aren't might also be a card to play. Think of any and every argument they might have (including stuff not trans-related, more trans-adjacent religious stuff), research it beforehand, and have responses ready. You will still be caught off guard. You can't predict every question. But know that you can always wait to answer them. The key is to stay cool and calm (which can be hard if they are verbally attacking you). This gives you control, especially if they are already compromised by their emotional outbursts. Just tell them something along the lines of ""I don't have enough facts or sources to feel comfortable giving you an answer at this time. I'd like it if we could come back to this conversation in x amount of time. That way, we can both research our positions better, so we can actually talk about this instead of talking past each other.' Just something like that. 

Whether in person or through text, I do think you should be prepared with either a script of sorts, or just text that you spend time on and have answers ready for quick replies. It's one thing to be confident in yourself, it's another to be confident in a talk with your parents when they are trying to tear you down. Have the tools you need at your disposal, both for the conversation itself, and for any self-care you might need after that. I, for one, watched a few hours of OneTopic and talked to accepting friends after the first night of my coming out to my parents. They eventually came around, but being able to watch something so positive and accepting, and talking to friends who were the same, really helped me on that initial night. Best of luck!
I'm 20 and about 15 months hrt. Still haven't come out. I'm also now at the stage of visibly trans. Although my family would be okay with it I've always struggled to. What I will say is they will figure it out soon enough. You can hide but it's probably best to tell them before. You are doing the right call for doing it over text, if they don't want to see you then that's fine. Assuming you're not reliant on them in any way. You've got a good supportive environment with coworkers and your sister so at least you've got people to fall back on. It's your life, not your parents. It'd be their loss if they cut you out. Best of luck ♥️
When I was 16 i came out to my dad by making a song (he was very involved in my music) and I said hey dad come check this out and I strapped headphones on him so he heard my voice creatively speaking how I felt and he looked at me surprised and hit play again.. After a few listens he took the headphones off and he said "" thats awesome. Best song yet"" .. Im 31 now and i have never come out to my mom (im sure she knows.shes religious and therefore has deemed these topics that of satans work) But my point is that it meant alot to my dad that I took the time to creatively tell him without having to tell him in person. Its a big moment in ur life . make it intersting . make it a good story. (Thanks for listening)
Since you’re financially independent and don’t rely on them for housing and your sister is supportive then I say rip the bandaid off, whisper yolo to yourself and cannonball off the metaphorical dock into a lake you haven’t put your toes into first.

I recommend using I am and I know language. Cis folks don’t question their gender Because they know they’re their gender. They are their sex/gender.

You are you and you know you’re you and this is is what you know to be right. Feels natural to you like breathing is for them. Comfortable. At home with yourself in a way you haven’t felt before now.

They’ll push back with trans trending misinformation. They’ll push back with social media made you this way… 
It was your friends that convinced you.

They’ll push back with its ungodly or whatever hell rhetoric they think will keep you cis and what they remember you to be. 

My father told me i had brain rot and needed to seek professional psychiatric help, that I was an abomination in the eyes of god and that this would cause such heart break to my mom and grandma that they would literally die from it. He went full hellfire and brimstone on me and we live in a pretty liberal area. My mom is still alive and my grandma died several years after accepting me so that wasn’t on me. 

Took my mom a few years to come around and use my name/pronouns and remind my dad when he slips up that my name isn’t that and my pronouns are she her. 

My sister and my niece accepted me radically. (One of my sisters best friends in highschool  was trans masc and she cried and said she just wanted me to be happy and started calling me sister bear.) ((used to be brother bear.))

I wish you luck. Expect the worst but hope for the best.
Are you me from the future in a bad timeline? Im 15 and haven't came out to my parents and you're saying you haven't done it for 7 years at 22 years old

Anyways, now you're away from them, you can transition and not worry about their transphobic asses
My son left me a letter as they were leaving for their mom's house - I don't think my son feared me, but they do suffer from anxiety and our relationship was distant since I was divorced from his mom - (He is 3 months into TRT and and quite happy!)

You're safety matters. If there is any question, do it from a distance. Schedule a facetime chat with them if possible. You deserve to be you if if family can't see that. It's not about them.
You’re doomed girl, I have gone through a bit of gender dysphoria and I’ve come in and out in the spam of a year due to my family and some poor decisions I’ve made (I’m 16) I really wish they could accept my desire to experiment and see if I’m trans or not but they will just not tolerate it. I still love them but I wish they could just accept it. Either way I wish you the best of luck just pray to Arceus and hopefully everything you will get more lucky than me. God bless you
Good points, I still want my parents to be a part of my life but if they aren’t going to treat me like a human being (or hopefully like their daughter), I shouldn’t have to defend my existence to them.
That makes sense, I was thinking of writing some notes for myself. Not sending too much at once so no one gets overwhelmed from a knowledge dump. I feel spacing out that I am bi and trans might help since they’re very illiterate in regards to anything LGBT.
Im going to need to send the exact same email so if you could just bcc me that would be great!
this is what i’m planning on doing. ideally i’d rather write a physical letter, but email is better because i can attach links to resources and time their receiving it which is ideal since my dad frequently travels for work. my situation is similar to OP’s (i’ve been on t for 9 months at this point and have seen my parents multiple times in person over that time period though). they had noticed my voice but i was able to brush it off and they are largely unsuspecting about it since they have no general awareness of the trans community. i wish both of you luck!
Yeah maybe a call could be better, I just feel texting allows me time to respond carefully and keep a “controlled environment”. Just in case my parents become reactionary and/or unreasonable
Yup, I definitely should prepare for that. I just hope they don’t go overboard. My parents play the victim a lot… making genuine discussion difficult.
Thanks, it’ll be tough but I hope they can have a change of heart
Good for you, you seem like a great mom!
My heart gets a little less hard everytime I see another loving and supportive parent post! My daughter came out officially in her mid 20s and I'm proud of her every day
I hope your workplace situation improves. I appreciate your insight. I’m going to have to be patient with my parents then.
thank you so much for this reply, its quite in depth and I hope I can handle this process as professionally as that.
thank you, this puts me at ease a little.
Thanks for the tips and encouragement, I appreciate it. Today’s the day, time to figure out if my parents really meant that “I’m always welcome” or if it was just a figure of speech.
You are absolutely right. You don’t need to defend yourself to them. The first time around for me my parents couldn’t stop treating me like a problem to fix, or a heathen to convert. The irony is I am a Christian too. lol I believe things will get better for the both of us though.
as I said I'm older 62 so texting still seems strange. I can't get nuance through text. it might feel different for a younger person or persons ie you and your family. I tried to avoid ""springing"" it on people so didn't have the conversation while presenting as my true self it seemed to give people a little time to get used to the idea. my coming put is prolly not like yours though. my mom is 85 and partly senile so I never actually came out to her. she still calls me girl and honey so I guess I'm getting it right. lol. at the end of the day it's your coming out and nobody can tell you how to do it. make it safe comfortable and above all joyful.
If text works better, use text. I also feel the next to respond carefully and neutrally, rather than emotionally. Make that clear, for example, if they try to call and confront you, you can reject the call and respond in text.
yep with relationships you want to save that's the ticket. some will just not be able to get there. I lost some friends and relatives along the way
I hope so too. I feel more alive than I’ve ever been, I just hope to celebrate it with the people I love; with or without my family.
Same here. I feel like all of my life I have still been in the womb, waiting for this moment when I truly start to live. My dream is that in the coming years I will be able to celebrate Christmas with my family as the real me."	xfrel2	trans	302	0.99	2022-09-16 13:31:13
I got outed. I feel so lost in a brand new way.	"I’m almost 3 years HRT. I pass, I own a house and I’m getting married. After years of waiting, life saving bottom surgery was only 6 months away. 6 months. 

I changed all my documents, finished college. Got my RN. I’ve got a year of experience on an ICU and was getting to be a great nurse. 

Last night I found out Florida is working on removing trans healthcare for adults. I’m nearly certain that my coverage, medical leave and scheduled date for bottom surgery are now over. 

I can’t lose that hope again. I don’t know how to live feeling this way for any longer then was planned. I’ve gained and lost hope over SRS happening too many times. 

Two hours after learning this I found out that one of my coworkers found old pictures of me and passed them around. I was stealth at work, living in Florida and all. And now everyone knows. My privacy, my safety, was stolen from me.  

I’m in so much pain. Not a single coworker asked them to stop. No one voluntarily told me.  No one. no one

I have so much going for me and I feel like I still failed. I still can’t get the healthcare I need, I still can’t be seen for who I am. I still didn’t do enough to make it 

I deleted my main Reddit account. My photos on there is probably what they found. I’m 25. I pass. I have a partner who loves me and I feel like tonight I lost too much. I was too late. 

I’m committed to living. Don’t send the help line info stuff. I just don’t know who else to tell."	"Is there no sexual harassment in FL?  You can't sue them and the company?  I'd ask a lawyer.  This sounds like a title VII layup.  This is federal law.  This is the whole reason why we vote.  Remember that any time people tell you the parties are ""the same"".

Oh, I swear! If I ever got a hold on the fool that made one of my girls cry, that ICU would be pretty fucking busy! I am too sick right now to be this angry!
So sorry for you. That's horrible and disgusting your coworkers did that.

As for Florida I don't really know what to say about that except it sounds like a hellhole for trans folks. There are better places, but it sounds like you have built a real life there.
Can you at least talk to HR? Why was someone passing around a photo of you and outing, essentially, private medical history without your consent? How could it be anything other than harassment? Seems like a lawsuit waiting to happen. 

I am sorry this happened to you.
Holy shit. I dont even know what to say. I'm so sorry. 

For me, I transitioned but couldnt access HRT for 8 years. So I came out knowing people would know. I didn't pass well and didnt have any hope of stealth. It was hell, but in a way it felt like saying Fuck You, you dont get to hold this over me. Now that I pass tho, and I just want to live my life, Im not stealth but if anything like this happened to me I cant even put into words how id feel. Especially the photos. Its just a violation on every level, the ultimate disrespect, traumatic as fuck, and these are medical staff???!?!?!?! God theyre sick. 

It sounds like they saw a successful person and wanted to tear him down. Yes, obviously its transphobia but I think there was jealousy and vindictiveness here too. If youre happy and successful, you will have haters who want what you have.

And its just straight up workplace harassment. I hope youre able to talk to someone about holding these people accountable 

Sending you all the love ❤️ Seriously, what the fuck. Im so sorry
Contact HR like yesterday. This is some sort of illegal. Harassment most likely. If HR does nothing, find another job and leave when and ONLY WHEN you get it lined up. Then threaten with a lawyer, you don’t even have to go through with suing or anything. Threats are usually enough when money is on the line.
Hugs to you. I am so sorry you experienced this betrayal of trust, you deserve better than that. Can you quietly and quickly find another job elsewhere? Do not tell others where you are going. I’m a cis male happily married to a trans woman for over ten years.
My cousin lives in Florida, FTM he and his wife are moving to Colorado.

I wish people could just mind their own buissness.
I go to work to do my job so i can provide a life for myself, my Gender and sexuality is fking irrelevent on the job. I dont get people, so many adult children in this world.
This is just a new step to our genocide. Stay strong
Srs has been a thing I was looking forward to that was taken away far too many times now. You don't deserve this crap.... I am so sorry Florida is like this.
It sounds like you might have to move from Florida sell your house and everything I would also inquire about an attorney about sexual harassment it does apply.
I’m so sorry; I cannot begin to imagine what you’re going through. I’m also a trans RN, about 6 months into working ICU in New Mexico. I’ve worked with several travelers from Florida, and nursing there sounds like a shit show, but this is something else. You shouldn’t have to being dealing with any of this.
It's not trivial to up and move, but Florida is doomed. Please try to get to a blue state, you'll be welcomed with open arms and the laws here are written to protect not harm.
It's not the best option but you could always relocate. That's something you'd have to discuss with your partner. If you came to Canada, which would be pretty easy as a nurse since we are constantly understaffed in the medical field, you could get permanent residency and your SRS would be completely covered by Canada's health care system.
A big undertaking but an option that could offer hope maybe.
Hey, I’m in Florida as well, and I’m not a lawyer or anything but I don’t believe the bill will pass. If it does it faces a lot of legal challenges in my opinion. If I understand the bill it’s going to hold the employer liable for gender affirming care after it has been provided. In a sense it’s like holding the company or entity liable for a knee surgery covered by their insurance years after it was performed. I don’t know how well that will hold up. I’m not sure if there are some insurance options provided by employers that give individuals access to procedures like BA for non-medical reasons but let’s say there is. It’s pretty ridiculous to turn around and hold the employer providing the health insurance liable for reversing the procedure if the individual doesn’t like it.

At this point though as I plan on getting SRS I’m probably leaving the state. Legislation is going down hill and I’m a state employee so my insurance doesn’t cover any trans healthcare unfortunately. I understand how you feel, I was thinking about leaving the state government for a private employer because of this.
Hey Alison ik it’s hard but know if you ever need someone to talk to or a shoulder to cry on lmk, dm me and I’ll be there
Im so sorry.  All those years I just wanted to be a girl, a woman.  But I didn’t know it was possible back then, and really it wasn’t a thing back then.  When I found a way to make it happen, I had to accept I was a trans woman.  I couldn’t change that, so I didn’t transition.  I tried to push it away… and when I accepted being a trans woman… I knew I’d never be passable… I couldn’t give up my kids and start a new life, even if I was passable.   I envied the gals who could pass and start a new life, but the danger was very evident to me, and I didn’t want to live another lie….  I’d have to be strong, suffer loss, such terrible loss.  

I’m so sorry what happened to you, you didn’t deserve what they did to you, people are cruel.  Especially right wing conservatives.   They are horrible people who will erase us.   

Your only option is to take that wonderful guy you have and move…. If you want to be stealth somewhere… be stealth in a liberal state.  But be a vocal ally….  Please… when I was in hiding, not out.. the only thing I could have the strength for was to support gay marriage and I lost friends over that…. If trans subjects came up, I was quiet.. I didn’t want to out myself.   Be strong.  Move away from that horrible situation and be an ally…. Be vocal.  Be passable… be the amazing person you are.
I'm so sorry this is happening to you and many other Americans.

I strongly believe America will have a civil war or something soon because they are just taking people rights and freedoms away.

Again so sorry can't imagine the pain your going through.

 Wish I could help more than suggest either move to another state or country. 

Hope you have a better day.
~~Blaming trans people for what fetishists and other weirdos are so obviously to blame for is beyond counterintuitive and I can't believe you can't see that OP.~~

Edit: I am so confused because this is not the post I put this comment on. So sorry OP, I hope things look up for you!
This is horible in so manyways. Im sorry i cant help but i wish that you atleast manage to find stable emplyoment elsewhere
God dammit I’m so sorry. Florida has become such a hellscape. It’s amazing to think that just a short time ago it used to be a swing state. Is there any chances you can move to a state that actually supports trans people? Florida seems to be the testing ground for all things horrible these days
OMG I’m so sorry!  Please don’t do end your life.  It’s not all over.  You live in FL and own a house there but that’s not the only place that has nurses.  You can absolutely find work in another state.  Easily.  25 is so young.  Trust me, I started my transition 14 months ago at 41 and it’s been rough.  I own a house and am transitioning in place.  Everyone knows but I’m in a blue state.  

Start looking for work in states that will protect our rights.  You don’t have to give up.  It may be a set back BUT even if it takes an extra two years, you’ve got so many decades left ahead of you to live.  I recognize it’s easy to say “just move” from my ivory tower of a blue state but it’s absolutely possible (though obv hard to do).  You CAN find work outside of FL.  

PLEASE please please please do not give up.
It seems like the time and risk to employment spent fighting that would be better placed by trying to escape the state ASAP

Something that egregious.  Make them pay so it doesn't happen to others there and at other companies.

Is this transphobia from my former classmates?	"Context: I already graduated, my classmates were always really supportive

One of my former classmates just sent me a text message saying that ""Hey! The other people in the classroom decided to do something that is, in my opinion, kinda transphobic, despite it being well-intentioned. They want to send you a ""Are you okay?"" message every month starting your 34th Birthday""

I was like ""Okay, that's kinda specific? I'm 19?"" and she said ""\[Another former classmate's name\] said he read that trans people only live up to being 34""

I was a bit confused and explained to her that that's a myth, statistics taken out of context.

She said ""Yeah, but the entire classroom decided they were gonna do that for your ""safety"" and I found it kinda iffy. Idk, am not trans, but I found it kinda transphobic. Warn them if you want.""

What do you think?"	"I would tell them no. That's not an ok thing to do.

It would be like asking someone who's gay if they got AIDS yet.
Or a black person if they got beat up by the police yet.

Just, no!
Tell them not to, but explain to them why - without calling them transphobic.

I don't think they're being transphobic, they're just ignorant on the subject. I'm sure they mean good, so there's no reason to call them out on that.

Take time to explain why it is a wrong belief. Maybe tell them that rather than message you every year, you could keep in contact in some other way.

They sound like good people to me, just a little uninformed.
I think that’s because the common statistic thrown around is trans people have a life expectancy of about 35 years, so yeah it’s kind of messed up to send a card every year
This actually helps explain an incident that happened to me recently. I'm a Crohn's patient, so I'm in the bathroom at my high school a lot. I've heard some kids insulting trans people while I'm in there, though I'm in the closet still. These boys started banging on the stall door and asking ""are you okay?"" which, at the time, seemed like an alright question, since I'd been in there a bit. Once they did it again though, I realized something was up, but I didn't understand what exactly they meant. I really hate high school.
immm not sure on that one lol
it’s like a joke, but it seems real. Which is a bit uhhhh, ignorant, really.
How about they just be good friends? And not wait around until they think you might die to try. Maybe they're referencing hate crimes or suicide rates for trans folk... who the fuck knows if those are accurate.  But the best way to prevent those things is through connection and support from those around you.

They're focused on the wrong thing and I would find this to be a malicious act from not well meaning people. I think it's awful for people to talk about anyone, especially a friend, so passively about their life. Maybe they've never lost someone so they're ignorant. They're ignorant to a lot of things and would need to shape up quick if they wanted to retain my friendship.
That’s got a weird condescending feel to it. Being concerned about someone’s health is one thing. 

Reminding them of a statistic of minority deaths is just a not so friendly reminder that we struggle. Fuck them. Better friends will come with time. Much love.
Laverne Cox turns 50 this year, she looks very healthy to me.

Whether or not it is transphobic (I'd say it is), it is definitely dumb to take that statement at face value.
Assuming theyre well intentioned, it sounds stupid but like theyre well meaning?
Tell them to Fnck off.  I’m not trans but that’s a bullshit question filled with condescension.  I would ask this so called well meaning asshole if she/he is okay, because it doesn’t appear so.  What an idiotic question to ask someone.
Block all of them
That sounds as welcome as dick pics tbh. A lot changes and people move on in that time. Most of them will be faded memories.
Transphobia aside, it’s also a stupid misuse of statistics. Average life expectancy of a population doesn’t tell us an individual’s life expectancy. I know I’m being pedantic, but your friends are being stupid.
It’s not transphobic but it’s certainly ignorant and in very poor taste
not really transphobic but definitely misguided
I wouldn't say it's transphobic, but it's still very much in bad taste
Let them, then set your phone to autoreply to them with ""Better than you, clearly.""
i ehm.. their hearts are in it but uh...


odd


they should rather put that work into educating themselves. though, a mental health intervention every month sounds like free therapy so if you need that then take it. but i would also try and educate them or tell them to educate themselves regardless
Yeah, that's a good point! Thank you!
Yeah this gave me the ""40% myth"" vibes without explicitly saying it. It could be well intentioned tho, but why start after 15 years from now?
This! Probably an awkward way of wanting to show you they care about you. If they were supportive before, there is no reason the entire class just turns against you. 

I’d tell them that you’d love to hear from them, they can start right now sending you a messages every month😄.
I myself am not understanding this, I'm sorry
Sorry you went thru that.
I don't understand
I can assure you they are well-intentioned, I knew them long enough for that. They're just being stupid
Excuse me?
Ok, sans are you ok!
Yeah, I'm not great at writing. TLDR: Transphobic boys pull the same crap on me in the bathroom, and now I feel even less safe in the bathroom.
Basically I wouldn’t call them transphobic I’d call them ignorant. Its as you said, a myth. It may be well intentioned but its a bit insensitive all things considered.
I'm glad they're well intentioned but it's definitely okay to let them know it didn't make you feel good.
Thats what I would do
Oh, yikes. It doesn't sound like theirs is well-intentioned tho, which is WAY worse than my case, sorry to hear
Jesus, everyone is so nice about this.  Its flat out wrong, period.  Highschool is hard enough, then add being Trans and then add someone asking I f it’s ok to ask you if you are ok every month.  Just in case you were feeling just fine, let’s Fnck that up a bit.  can’t,

Frankly, LaNacha,  ask this well meaning asshole if she/he is ok, as you were thinking they seemed depressed lately.  Let them go home and see how it feels to have someone else examine their feelings whether true or not.  Dead serious. That  will shut her/him up real fast. .
Yeah
My classmates are like a second family to me, I could never do that
I think you're misunderstanding that I already graduated, and my classmates were always nice to me
damn ok yea fair then, kinda jealous ngl since everyone in my class was homophobic gym bros. Im not in contact with any of those pieces of shit anymore.

Hitchhiking as a Trans Woman?	"I always dreames of hitchhiking across Europe. Visiting as many countries as possible, seeing beautiful vistas and visiting historical places, with only whatever I can carry on my backpack.

The thing is I am also a trans woman. Both the words ""woman"" amd ""trans"" don't scream safety, even more so when combined.

I'm still pre-everything and don't pass at all, so I could easily do it in boymode. But who knows where I'll be in my transition journey when I decide to go, and in an ideal world I would much rather do it as my authentic self.

Do you think I'm overthinking the risks of going hitchhiking? How risky it trully is? If there are any trans hitchhikers in here, I'd love to hear your stories and tips for when my time comes.

[UPDATE] Well this blew up overnight. Opinions ranged all the way from ""it's a death wish"" to ""it's pretty chill"", although the vast majority seems to think it's a really bad idea. Oddly enough the few people who were favourable to the idea are the ones who claim to have actual experience with hitchhiking.

Still, it's better safe than sorry, so I'll probably not be hitching any hikes anytime soon. There were many good suggestions on how to move about the Old World without having to rely on the kindness of strangers, the main ones being the ride sharing app Blablacar, and buying an Eurotrail pass for cheap train travel (choo choo!).

I'll admit that I kind of forgot that hitchhiking and backpacking were not synonyms, and I might have used the words interchangably. Still it's sad that it seems to be so dangerous to trust other people. Hitchhiking has a certain glamour that, sadly, seems to be lost in the real world.

Thank you so much for all who showed concern towards me! I trully appreciate you stopping by to show your concern to a stranger. If more people were like you, maybe we could all hitchhike in safety."	"I would strongly recommend buying a Eurorail pass. Yeah you’ll spend a bit of money, but it’s much much safer.
Hitchhiking is a bad idea.  
Every girl I know who did, had to get out of some dangerous messed up situation.  
Also, it‘s totally unneccessary:  
Europe has a great network of trains and busses. Get a train ticket for exploring europe and enjoy.
Hitch-hiking in general is a bad idea.

It's romanticised WAY too much. Doesn't matter if you are male or female, trans or cis. You should NOT hitch-hike unless there is abdolutely no other option.

It's even more dangerous in a country you don't live in, as you won't be able to take account of the 'red-flags' that may be known to locals, and people will prey on that.

Basically, it's a bad idea at best, and s*cide mission at worst.

(Sorry, not trying to come across as harsh, but please keep yourself safe.)
I’m sorry but that sounds like the least safe thing it’s possible to do. I have never done anything like it so I’m not the person to ask, but I doubt it’s even safe for cis men, it’s obviously super dangerous for any woman. Can’t you just take a bus or something?

Europe has all kinds of trains and stuff right?
I do see hitchhiker's in Germany quite frequently, and have picked them up a couple of times. But never solo females. I have also hitchhiked in Norway when I was a guy when I was hiking because walking through the tunnels is very dangerous (not much oxygen, lots of carbon monoxide, you start to get green and purple vision lol)
  
I think from my experience you would be fairly ok in eg Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Netherlands and Germany as long as you were able to refuse rides, but that's not really hitchhiking. In boymode of course.
  
Better and safer idea that's more reliable: We have this ride-sharing thing called blablacar, where people register car journeys they are taking and you can share the ride. It is extremely cheap and you can go very long distances, it is also fairly reliable and there are lots of journeys every day between any two locations. It's quite social too.
  
Also, you should take advantage of the excellent train services. You can do something called interrail that gives you a train pass for a few weeks.
  
Basically, there just isn't that much hitchhiking, and it's probably not a good idea as a trans person. Mostly it's smelly hippies anyway and nobody wants them in their Audi.
Don't.  It's extremely dangerous.
Honestly traveling Europe it’s easiest just to get a eurail pass. They are seriously not that expensive and you can go anywhere. Best way to travel Europe.
Don't hitchhike. No matter how you look, don't ever do that, that's really just inviting danger in. Go with Flixbus if you wanna travel cheaply or maybe go by train, but never ever ever hitchhike unless you have somewhat of a deathwish.
You could do interrailing instead. That's something a lot of people do where they pay for being able to travel by train across Europe for a set number of days. It's not going to be as romantic as hitchhiking but it's safer and you can still visit cool areas. The train network across Europe is pretty good
Hunny. Please don't
Welp everyone seems to be in agreement lol. Yea I wouldnt hitchhike if I was a burly cis guy with US marine hand to hand combat training cause three guys in a car with guns on u is gonna make it rlly hard to do anything, even if u have a gun or knives or any other weapons yourself it’s basically pointless. If ur traveling across Europe a little silent panic button might be a nice investment
No, just no.
I’m a cis white male, and the first thing I think of when someone says “hitchhike” is “I’m gonna get murdered”. I’m gonna say just take a train trip or a river cruise if you want to see lots of places in one go. Hitchhiking no matter what you present as sounds like a great way to become a missing person.
Trans european (french) here! I recommend using Blablacar. It's *a lot* cheaper than a train and usually safe (you can choose to travel with women drivers if it makes you feel safer, and read review about drivers and other passengers. But you may not always find people who speak english.
I have heard that trains across Europe are amazing, they sound like an infintely safer option
Only times I ever felt comfortable hitch hiking was on a small island in summer when we were coming back from the beach, it was a rl small and friendly community so it was totally fine. Other time was when we were going back to our trailer we were staying in on holiday and there was a mom bear on road and we got a lift back with an old lady instead of walking by after dark (also in a small and friendly and generally safe area) Generally Tho hitchhiking is rl not a good idea for anyone even if your a cis dude with multiple friends, anything can happen ya know
Well I haven’t been to Europe so hard to say what the situation is. Now I will say off the top of my thoughts no, I agree with another comment that it is generally not safe for cis gender. In the 1960’s and 1970’s generally speaking was safe in the USA and Canada. I will say no way women hitched in the USA Canada was a different story beautiful girls hitched all over especially Western provinces. I myself hitched all over the USA in the early 1970’s would I today absolutely not it’s to dangerous. I’m older of course and have experience and I’m non binary but I’m married to a girl. I feel your frustration on wanting to be yourself and that’s healthy but please don’t put yourself in harms way. 
Please make the best of it and understand most folks don’t understand what you are experiencing shamefully as it is. 
Hugs and safe travels
There’s a Facebook group called Solo Female Travelers. I would suggest checking it out. My partner uses it and they have told me lots of great things about how helpful it can be. They will have a ton of advice and suggestions for you down to the best places to stay in specific cities if you need that.
On my bucket fantasy list
I am a trans woman andI have hitchhiked throughout Central Europe over the summer and I was fine, make sure u don’t do it alone tho 😅
I do not know about now adays but it used to be common to hitchhike with truckers and use church resources offered to truckers til you hit a town you want to site see or temp live at and pick up a cash job.   (This was told to me buy people who traveled Europe in the early 2000s) so it is probably different
I’m travelling Mexico solo, I have no problems here at all but I do pass pretty well. (Mexico is very homophobic and bigoted unfortunately since they’re very behind in some ways)
Trans man here, I've had the same dream since forever. I'd love to hitchhike across Europe, maybe western Asia as well and/or south America some day. Just go without knowing where I'll sleep tomorrow and try to make new acquaintances along the way. 

Maybe I'm lucky because someday, I might pass enough to hitchhike with male privilege. Maybe I'm unlucky because if I'm not brave enough to transition, I'll have to do it as the wrong gender _and_ with the added dangers of being seen as a woman.

I do believe you could eventually eliminate the trans bit and be stealth, especially since you don't spend huge amounts of time with the same people while hitchhiking. But still that sounds unsafe especially in eastern and maybe southern Europe. Boymode would be safe but I can see how you wouldn't want that. 

Is it safer to hitchhike as a group? I could come along yknow ;)
Even when navigating the world as a little girl, the ""don't walk alone"" fears never got to me, so I'm not giving a superstition / fear based answer.

Don't. At least not in East Europe. In Hungary you'll just have lots of trouble, as a foreigner who doesn't speak the language, as a woman, as trans. And who knows what the situation will be when you get here, both here and in Poland the laws and attitudes are not great... But at least we have trains and barely anyone has guns, so you can absolutely backpack all over the place on public transport and won't get shot.

Edit: btw if any of you are planning a visit to Hungary and need some couch surfing options near the capital, I may be able to figure something out with a few days notice, no guarantees except lots of cat hair
Backpacking is safe enough, hitchhiking alone absolutely not.

Backpacking culture is incredible and everyone looks out for one another. You’ll easily find a group that will give zero fucks about your transness, and you will be safer for their company.

Hitchhiking is usually part of the experience, but is a risk for anyone. I wouldn’t suggest hitchhiking solo to anyone, least of all a non-stealth trans person. Trust your instincts and don’t sacrifice your safety for politeness. Decline a ride if you feel any kind of uneasy, especially if you even think you may have been clocked in a negative way.

Violence is a fact of life for trans people. Don’t let anyone invalidate that fear. But also look at it as a risk to be managed, rather than something that should limit your dreams.
One last thought on your update. While I am not bashing addiction because this has become a relentless problem and people do crazy things on drugs. Hard drugs has exasperated the violence world wide and has to many degrees disrupted some of our most cherished past times “ unfortunately”. The world is not as safe as during my younger years and while I feel most folks would embrace new acquaintances there is always that one that puts your life in danger. Yes I traveled all over the USA in the early 70’s and loved it I had so much fun and the stories I can tell of my experiences. However I will agree with other comments to go for it be you just make sure and analyze what to are about to do. I’m just stating my position that it is to dangerous in my opinion. We will never meet but it would be nice to have met you in a safe place so I could hear about your transition and share my fantasies. Good luck my friend and stay safe!
Just do what you want to do
Not at all it’s not safe anywhere anymore
Hitchhiking is pretty dangerous no matter who you are but especially so for trans folks. If you want a similar but safer experience I recommend public transportation. The public transportation system in Europe is amazing compared to America and you can get literally anywhere
I am a trans man, and hitchhiked for a year in the U.S. also hitchhiked with someone who was trans femme but butched it up on the road (she's pretty butch anyway so it was natural, not hiding herself more than she was comfortable with).

I would not recommend hitchhiking alone. Pairs is where it's at bc it's just so much safer all around. Here in the u.s we call that a ""road dog"". Others can speak more on this from me, but from stories with my friends, hitchhiking as a woman are inflicted with a lot of creepy solicitations and bad vibes.

Wishing you luck. Hope you can find a friend to travel with!

If you have no such luck in finding a buddy, perhaps more traveling with less hitchhiking is in order, like using a euro pass. Plus side of the euro pass is you can sleep saftley on the train (sleep is a big obstacle when hitchhiking anyway).

Good luck OP!

Hit me up if you have any other questions.
Honestly, it depends on the region. Western and northern Europe? Hell yes! Balticum? Hell no! Balkan? Depends on the country.

I'd probably swap hitchhiking for an InterRail pass, though. You won't get a 1st-class suite on any train with it, but it's warmer, cozier and most of all more secure than getting into strangers' cars.
Me even before going on HRT never could trust any unknown male... I never hitch hiked ever or enter strange people's apartment.  They all wanted sex
Please dont hitchhike. Its so dangerous its just not worth it.
Maybe New Zealand would be a better option if you are set on a hitchhiking trip.
You can travel by train all over Europe. Much more convenient and definately a lot safer!
Train trip! Thanks for the suggestion, I'll keep it in mind!
Eurorail would be safe and ideal to explore Europe
Was just going to say the same thing. DO NOT HITCHHIKE in Europe. Especially not alone and most certainly not as a trans woman. Most western states are ok for trans people, Eastern EU on the other hand is def not safe for trans people in general. 

Eurorail passes are cool, but I’d still stay away from places like Poland, Hungary and Italy.
I went to Europe and bought the euro rail pass, big mistake, each train rides cost way less and taking the bus is also so convenient. I ended up wasting half my pass as well and it wouldn’t even work for tgv either
I appreciate the concern. It's a bummer but you seem to be on the side of the consensus.
[removed]
Yeah, even as a grown cis man, I would definitely not put myself in such a compromised situation. Once you step into their vehicle, you are in the space of a stranger.
Do this.
Bla bla car is cheap, useful and most of the time there is a ride to most major cities in Germany.
For the time there won't be any, get a train pass.
I heard about this app before. Can you explain me how it works and how it differs from other ride sharing apps like Uber?
Train does sound like the mist recommended way to go about. And trains are pretry cool as well. Cheaper than an Eurotrail pass would be train surfing but, contrary to what most people in here might think, I don't ACTUALLY have a death wish.
What's this fixbus thing, if I may ask?
It would be a nice chamge of pace to be in a part of the world that actually has trains.
I appreciate the concern, but you make it sound like every person who picks up hitchhikers is a psycopath with a collection of machetes on the trunk. If that were the case, there wouldn't be any hitchhikers anywhere anymore.

Still, train sounds nice and that's probably what I'm going with.
I heard good things about this app. How does it work, and how does it differ from something like Uber?
Thanks for the tip but I'd rather not return to Facebook. Maybe I can find a similar group somewhere else.
Sure thing! Central/North Europe seems to be the saver region to do this kind of stuff.
Alas East Europe/West Asia doesn't seem to be too friendly towards queer people. Even though I'd love to know Poland or Russia I don't think I'd go there any time soon.

I was wondering the same thing about hitchhiking in groups. Maybe having a hike buddy would keep the more undesirable people away.
Hitchhike with a friend!

If you have a buddy, there is always someone able to sit behind the driver and make sure nothing dangerous goes down!
I hitchhiked for a year around the U.S. as a 1 year on T guy. With a friend I think it's a lot safer
While I'd like to visit East Europe, I know that the situation there is not the best for queer people, unfortunately.

But cat hair sounds lovely, sign me up!
Well the backpacking is the priority, so at least it'a good to know that that's still an option. Hitchhiking could be a cool experience but I have no problem switching it for a train ride or a ride share app.
Well it's certainly a breath of fresh air to find someone who doesn't think it's a suic**e mission. Finding a hiking buddy would probably be best for hitchhiking, although I'm leaning towards a train pass. Thanks for the tips!
Yeah, East Europe seems to be a no-go for queer people, unfortunately. Interestingly, you seem to be okay with the idea in West/North Europe, which is more than pretry much anyone here.

Lots of people also recommended the InterRail/Eurotrail pass, not sure what the difference is here. I also heard about the ride sharing app Blablacar, and something called Fixbus.
Why is that? Is NZ that much safer than Europe? I wouldn't mind backpacking across Middle Earth.
No need to be rude about it.

I do know what I'm talking about, especially as someone who has travelled by himself for years. You may have different experiences, and that's cool.

I also live in a place full of backpackers. People don't hitch-hike, it's too risky. Unless they want their body to end up dismembered in a barell, which happens.

When you hitchike you take a risk. When you hitchhike as a woman, you double that risk. When you hitch hike as a trans woman, you quadruple that risk. When you hitch hike as an early transition trans woman, you 100x multiply that risk.

To OP: if you wanna do it, go for it. But know the risks.
Well your comment certainly is a stark contrast to the others here. Interesting how positive you feel about it having first-hand experience. Makes me wonder how many of the people who think it's a super bad idea have actually hitchhiked before.
People only take you on for rides they weee already planning on doing.

I.e you work in Hamburg but live in Berlin, so you drive to Berlin every Friday and back to Hamburg every Sunday. 

So you put in that repeating trip in the app, set where you will be able to pick up someone and then they‘ll book your ride.


Or maybe you are going from Hamburg to Hannover for a business trip. Just put it on the app and earn a few Euros extra.


Hence pick up sites mostly being limited to central features of those cities and Autpbahn Rest stops in between, unless the autpbahn happens to pass right through a city.



Blablacar is an actual ride sharing app.

Uber etc are just modern taxi services exploiting the hog economy.
So basically people who are driving from eg Barcelona to Madrid to visit their grandmother register an account and upload their journey details and any stops. There is a fixed price calculated for the distance that people will pay to take a seat in the car. Blablacar takes the payments for 3 seats people sign up for and sends it to the driver. After the journey the three people give ratings. Most drivers use the app regularly - some people use it on their commute for example.
  
My partner sometimes uploads her ride when she goes from Germany to a neighboring country. The people are normally fine, but having to make extra stops crazy-taxi style to pick people up and drop them off is time consuming.
  
So it's like Uber but it's not professional and the distance can be much much longer - think Paris to Bruges.
You can just get an account and have a look - it's quite sophisticated.
It’s a German company that offers extremely cheap bus fares.
UK has lots of trains here too :) sometimes in London it can get a bit congested but overall it's nice 

You can have a fun adventure
It only takes one psychopath to ruin your life.

Ultimately the question is “how much do you value your safety and how much are you willing to risk?”
I mean, a guy I went to high school with “disappeared” while trying to hitch from our town to Colorado… so I may be a little paranoid.
You act like a person has to be a “psychopath with a machete” to be dangerous. It doesn’t take some special, evil person to do violence. It could really easily be some random guy.

Also, human trafficking, mugging, etc is a real thing, and as a tourist you would be a target. For example, my dad was once on a trip overseas, walking with my sibling (who was like 8 at the time) and a guy tried to convince him to come into an unmarked building to see an art gallery. Sketchy as that sounds, in the moment my dad was about to go in because the guy seemed completely genuine and nonthreatening. But he remembered that he had read about a scam where people do that exact thing to tourists in order to mug them.
So people on Blablacar are not professionnals, they're just going somewhere and have decided to take passengers for some money. You just have to go on the app or website, enter the town you're leaving, the one where you're going and the day. And then Blablacar will give you all the drivers passing by both towns (or towns near the ones you asked for). You pay on the app, and then the driver has to accept taking you (it's pretty fast, a few hours max). If they refuse you get a text and you get your money back. If they accept you get a text giving you the driver's phone number.

You can also send messages through blablacar before paying.
Same. I'll only go there once I'm 100% certain I'm trad looking. We have plenty of friends from Poland (older ones) and while they're all incredibly welcoming and sweet, there is no being queer in their presence. 

At the very least, travelling in groups or pairs would make it harder to trap and/or ransack you
Ohh that sounds great! Now I just need to find a buddy who's okay with having a bit of an unclear travel itinerary, my friends are all used to squeaky clean hotels. Will definitely try one day though. Props to you for getting there! Where'd you travel if I may ask?
Yeah, train pass is definitely what I'd do in Europe!!

Hitchhiking takes a lot of mental and emotional energy to deal with. The expensive part for a Europe trip is the plane ticket and lodging. Train ticket would save you time and a lot of mental energy otherwise constantly planning rides/not knowing where you'll end up.

Hope you can bring your dream to life!!! Good luck!
I took a van trip across New Zealand 10 years ago and it always felt safe. I remember thinking this place would be the place to hitchhike. I don’t know the actual situation now but I did see travelers hitch hiking.
Interesting. I'll certainly keep it in mind.
Yes, as far as I know you can travel to multiple European cities though.
One of the funniest things I noticed when visiting London was how much people complained about hands down the best public transport system I've ever used.
Sounds simple enough! I'll ceetainly consider it when/if I go backpacking.
We left from Kansas City and travelled mostly parallel and West of Missouri. If you look at a map, Westward is much less dense, and so was much easier to find places to sleep for free than the larger metropolises Eastward.

It's so very beautiful
Lmao. It is very very difficult at rush hour. Especially for people commuting regularly. Anyone that lives long term in London hates the public transport as the tourists use the same stuff and it gets super congested. But that's the nature of being a mega city it's going to be like that lol
oh I forgot! they also have bus (which belongs to blablacar) they are *really* cheap. so if you see one take it.
I don't know about that. I worked in London for six months and got on both the tube and bus more than once during rush hour. Sure it was crammed and slow, but nothing compared to my home city. And besides you have maps of the bus routes in every stop! And a display showing the arrival time! That stuff blew my mind!"	s4f295	trans	234	0.98	2022-01-15 07:41:15
26yo, this is pretty much my everyday look, and sometimes I still keep getting stares and comments, even got punched in the face last year for being who I am, so I guess I am asking for safety reasons as well as curiosity... but do I pass?		"As I like to be honest, especially as you've had issues; you don't 100% pass. I watch a lot of makeup subreddits so as I was scrolling I didn't know the community you posted to, and thought ""MtF"" rather than cis-f.


Is this image filtered or have a lot of soft light added?

Contouring will help a ton. You have a bold jaw line and without bangs your head looks longer, which can fire off the masculine thing. 


 There can also be a lot more to it, like body shape and mannerisms.

Edit: thin out your lips if you can so they look wider, as their roundness adds to the bolding chin and cheek area which is more masculine in shape.
To be honest, I would say that you don't quite pass. The chin and jawline to me are kind of coded as masc. Your brow ridges also kind of create a shadow, which is then darkened further by the way you do makeup. I think there are definitely hairstyles and ways of doing makeup that could help with those things.

I'm sorry to hear that you were punched by someone. That was very cruel of them. Trans people deserve to be treated with respect. Also, I really like your dark aesthetic.
I think thick brows and heavy lipstick is the reason you might be off for some people who are punching you and stare. Everything other seems good and you’re quite nice.
I don't like to sugar coat things but as of now no  but you definitely have potential to for sure.
You have lots of potential. I like your style too. I was gonna comment on your hair and your eyebrows. 

Somebody else said it but you would benefit from bangs. For some reason, I feel like you won't like them so at the very least you could try more of a side part. Middle parts are one of the tougher hairstyles to pull off for anybody, cis or trans.

Now for your eyebrows, they need to be higher. You already fill in your brows so this shouldn't be too big of a deal but it will take some experimenting. Think of millimeters ABOVE your natural brow. It'll give you a more feminine, lifted look. 

The best way to achieve this is to stand under overhead lighting when you get to your eyebrows. This should cast shadows caused by your browbone. The trick is to draw the top of your eyebrows above the shadows. You want to open up the eye and it could also help offset your stronger jawline.

I'm sorry you've gone through some shit because of who you are. I think you'd get lots of stares even if you did pass. You definitely stand out and sometimes it's hard to tell if it's because you're trans or because you look good. 🤷‍♀️
I think you are beautiful. And yes.
You look somewhat clockable but thats if im really looking and focusing on the smaller details like your brow line and chin. Cause if im not being nitpicky you give off very much girl next door,maybe even a little toned down elvira.
[deleted]
As others have pointed out, your jawline is your worst enemy right now. But other than that, you're doing awesome! Goth girls are best girls! With some contouring (or a few months of E, if you haven't started/haven't gotten facial changes yet), I'm sure you'd pass just fine. \^.\^
Oh shit that sucks girl, sorry to hear you were punched. Some people should have just been swallowed. To me you pass. Though New Zealand is pretty chill in terms of being trans. Comments and laughter is the worst I've had.
You kinda pass but it's not 100% it depends on the person who's seeing you to decide whether or not they think you're trans
Hey I think the biggest issue might be your facial frame, since my face shape is pretty similar to yours. When you have a longer face its best not to do middle parts, as it adds emphasis to your shape. Id cover your forehead with bangs so it brings more attention to your eyes, thats what I did and its helped wonders
You look great! One tip—when you go with a bold lipstick color (which hell yeah you should), make sure you don’t accidentally widen your lips too much. I do this all the time!
I think you pass perfectly :)
I think you pass very well. Your lips and cheeks are very femme!
Hell yes. Looking good too. 😍
On looks I’d say absolutely
Girl, you look like CHER!
You don't pass
you pass better than i will
Makeup looks nice and smooth, esp around your eyes, but you'll notice a big difference with contouring and slimming the lips a bit as someone else said. Honestly you're giving me [young Cher](https://ibb.co/nRCY7w1) vibes, the only major difference I'm seeing is the (makeup) contouring and getting some volume in the hair. Some of that takes time and learning different techniques that work for you, so take all this with a grain of salt.

Where you live and the population around you is likely a bigger factor in safety than how you present, some areas are just more full of assholes than others. People who are secure in themselves and confident don't respond to someone with violence, even if they don't agree or approve of whatever. Keep ya head up, girl!

Edit: forgot a space, it was bothering me
pretty 😊❤️😊
unfortunately i wouldn’t say you pass all the way. you’re definitely on the way to passing tho. i’d suggest restricting how much you fill in your eyebrows and maybe even thin them out.
Thankyou sm 😁 honesty is what I came for and I'm happy you understand why I sought it, being verbally attacked for being myself ain't nice, but I expected it and I've adapted somewhat, but the physical attack did shake me up and its the biggest drive behind my 'passing paranoia'... I mean there is the dysphoria too 🙄 but I'm more scared of others than myself 🤷‍♀️

I don't actually contour, its not something I've yet learned or even tried, but thanks for that tip 🥰

2 of the images are filtered and 2 aren't 🙂

Yeah they're my natural lips, I used to get bullied at school for the fullness of my lips, being too 'girly' actually, but guess who's laughing now? 😅 but honestly tho, a lot of people these days tell me that my lips are one of my best features? 🤷‍♀️
Thankyou sm 🥰 im honestly open to suggestions, just don't change my dark witchy vibes pls 🥺
Yeah, im still mastering brows tbh 😅 I got the shape right, just not the thickness 🤷‍♀️ nah actually when I got punched I even had my mask on as I was walking between the shop and my house so it wouldn't be the lippy, thankyou for your honest feedback tho and thankyou sm for the compliment 🥰
That sounds promising, do you have any advice? 😊
Thankyou for you advice 😊 eh I've been social transitioning for nearly 3 years but there is still a lot to learn yet 😅 there is a lot I need to try.. and I did have a side parting when it was blonde, I had this style recently 🥲
Thankyou 🥰😊
Aww thankyou 🥰 that's a nice compliment ☺
This is one of my favourite comments! 🥰🖤
Yeah unfortunately I'm not yet on E... I'm British, going the NHS route and unfortunately that means I've been waiting for it for about 3 years now, I hate this so much tbh, but thabkyou for giving me hope 🥰
Yeah Britain is actually quite a transphobic place tbh, im from some small village so nobody really understood, now I live in Nottingham City for university and the city trats me a little better than the village did, but I still get comments here in Notts
Yeah I have a terrible ubderbite, although I might be able to get separate surgery to reset my jaw, not sure tho if resetting you jaw is optional when it comes to ffs surgery? I know they do something with the jaw 🤷‍♀️ but if not then yeah I could get separate surgery for that, but thankyou, I am fully aware of my jawline, it why I never accept pictures of the side of my face 🥲

Many people say that bangs would work wonders for me so yeah I wanna get that done too

Tha know for your compliments 🥰 I suppose I'm not trying to even look pretty, I just don't wanna ever be confused for a male, I just wanna pass, no matter the beauty standards ygm?
I think a side part would look really good on you
Hmm but I don't really do anything to make my lips fuller or longer, these are my natural lips and I try to be really precise with lipstick not to extend them or make them fuller 🤔
Thankyou ☺ its always nice to hear, maybe when I *eventually* start hrt things might go smoother?
Aww thankyou sm 🥰
Thankyou 🥰 I try my best but I still get called out 🤷‍♀️
Thankyou sm 🥰 this question has been bothering me for like 2 years but I never like to ask, and I wanna know why I get stared at when somedays I feel confident 🤷‍♀️
I've heard that before 🥰 aww thankyou ☺ thats such a compliment!
Okay, a bit sharp.. I appreciate your honesty but do you not have any 'constructive criticism'?
I'm sorry if you believe that, but even tho I don't know what you look like, I doubt it hun
Fair enough on the lips, was more so a note that probably can be ignored with other contouring. With your chin and jaw you end up a bit blocky, so contouring is going to be huge. Luckily it's the main focus of a TON of MtF makeup tutorials. 

The first one has thinner eyebrows (or at least looks that way) which is way more feminine that larger blockier shapes.
Oh, dark witchy vibes are the best vibes. I would never dream of trying to change those. ;-)

I'm just a cis straight guy, so I'm not really a super expert on hair and makeup for women. But I think some subs for those things would be able to give you some suggestions about hair and makeup to emphasize or de-emphasize certain features.
Well honestly you have really pretty eyes so maybe bringing more attention to them would go along way, less attention to your lips tho always good having them thick they are probably pronouncing your jaw line a bit too much. Im no make up artist just a regular guy but you definitely have feminine characteristics just have to bring them out.
Damn, that sucks! I hope you won't have to wait much longer. But yeah, just soften up that jawline a bit with cosmetics, in the meantime, and I think you'll be golden!
Wow! Opposite for me. Auckland was kinda phobic so I moved to a small country town in the south island. Kinda famous lol but just stares some people say hi it's cool though
You're definitely not male, trust me girl I have a strong underbite and sharp jaw too, but honestly sharp jaws are universally beautiful. I kind of have a punk look but I did a part on the side of my head and I cover the left side of my face with hair to avoid attention to my side portfolio. I think you could adopt similar strategies to help with passing, im not quite their yet either though. Regardless, you're really beautiful, genuinely
Also I just saw that you were prehrt, your progress is incredible, if you look like this prehrt I wouldn't worry, regardless if you pass now you will certainly pass in the near near future, the fact you look the way you do without hormones is astounding
Wow! You’re better at lipstick than I am, then—I suck at precision. Sorry for making an assumption. You really do look great, girl.
Your look is unique, but very sexy and feminine. I dig it :)
The jawline looks too prominent, I don't know how to address that ...
i look like a fat Gaston
Youre too kind I can't take it 🥺🥰🙈 I've already changed my hair once 😅 hopefully bangs will sort it all out until I can fully transition, and yeah, this country sucks... I've been waiting 3 years for hrt 😭 so I've had to do the best I can with what I can, sure its good as its forced me to change through my own actions, but it sucks because my mental state is fucked and I know hormones will help massively, but its the UK... we have to struggle 😪

Safety!	"Hello everyone, Garrett here!

This is just your reminder to be safe when you bind and to take breaks often!

I sadly had to learn the hard way that you can hurt yourself very easily... But I am fine now and here to remind you that while it may feel good in the mean time the after effects can hurt (a lot) 

Just know you ar perfect the way you are!

Love ya'll ❤"	"Is this supposed to happen with a proper binder?
Oof. Glad you’re okay now!

My son has just started binding and my wife and I have both gently talked to him about doing so safely, and telling him that we’ll make sure to get him properly fitting binders.
This! Esp if you have a bigger chest. I have DDD/F cups and binding for 6 hours a day regularly hurt me bad, to the point I might need shoulder surgery now
I really need a binder, but I have no clue where to find a good one to buy
I've been binding for a month...

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

straight.
I used to bind every day, all day, only took it off to sleep or shower but even though I haven’t been binding for months I still experience discomfort with my breathing and chest pain when I move a certain way, is there anything I can do?
It can happen if you wear it wrong. 

Like too long, when you're doing sports, swimming in it etc.
If I am being honest I don't know, I got a very very cheap one (I do not recommend getting cheap ones) and slept in it, I woke up and I was in a lot of pain 😅

Luckily I don't think I broke anything but I'm still a tad sore from that
So happy to see ya'll being supportive of your son, best wishes you ya'll ❤❤
Same, please be cautious with what you buy and don't get a cheap one like I did
The gc2b binders are pretty awesome and do seem to live up to the hype. They even give me decent results, and I have a *tiny* ribcage despite being tall af.

My US bra size should be 30E, if I converted it correctly,  so yeah, I'm an emphasised hourglass. And they get me to look rather flat, which is nice.
No no no no pls stay safe! I have never seen a situation where that ends well TwT
How long is too long, out of curiosity
Yeah, I would make sure you have a quality one, that is very important.

I am MTF so I don't know a lot about binding. But from what I have seen I don't think it should hurt after several hours.
Hell yeah!

I want him to grow up without any of the pain I suffered through. He has dysphoria for sure, but it’s not coupled with the fear and pain of the closet, and never will be.
Ooo- Tysm!
It's alright haha sorry for the scare! It's pretty loose so it doesn't even affect me that much. Thanks though <3
The time I read most is 8hours 
If youre short-breathed or have pain you should put it off sooner though. 
It's also important to take breaks, go to a restroom and maybe take it off for 2-3mins
I would limit binders to a work day of 8 hours maximum each day.  Medically speaking wearing a binder for more than half the day can absolutely cause shifting of ribs and cause health complications over time, especially if the person is developing still (in their teens).

So huggles, be smart and limit your time wearing binders!
8 hours I think is the standard binding time
Sounds like that was the problem then assuming OP slept for more than 8 hours.

Looking into a better binder might still be a good idea.
Yes with binders, quality is important
I am just very stupid to fall asleep in it, I definitely am looking into buying a better one
I wore it for more than 8 hours, and I had massive back pain. Since not needing the binder any more it got soooooo mich better"	ts5njw	trans	205	0.98	2022-03-30 12:47:12
I’m literally sobbing	So an old (emphasis on old) friend of my late father’s messaged me on Facebook earlier. We hadn’t spoken in many years, and he started the conversation with “is this [insert deadname here]” which immediately sent me into a full blown panic attack. I responded with “I no longer go by that name, but I think you found who you’re looking for” and we talked for a few minutes, catching up, and finally discussed my transition. When it came up, he said “oh! Well that explains the name change!” And spent the following several messages expressing his love and support. Absolutely shattered my very best hopes and expectations, as well as transcending every stereotype in the book about religious elderly folks. We talked awhile longer, and I found out that his wife (whom I knew, and was well aware that he loved very much) recently passed, and that he was in the hospital unable to stand or walk. I’m absolutely heartbroken. We were close when I was young, and he’s never been anything but genuinely kind and wonderful to me. I regret not talking to him for so many years out of fear. If I learned anything from this, it’s to give people a chance (assuming your physical safety isn’t at risk) because they might surprise you. Much love ya’ll	"This is something a lot of people (including myself) need to hear. Thanks <3
My grandpa used to call my dad a sissy for drinking through a straw. I recently found out his brother’s best friend was a lesbian farmer who lived next door. Life is terrible sometimes, but we have to leave room for the good if we want to survive it.
Coming from somebody that grew up in rural Northern Kentucky with only strong republican christians surrounding me my entire life up until I transitioned, I’ve had a few rare occurrences like this. Unfortunately I also have had my own family members say some nasty stuff about me as well as members from my ex church. I do want to say that, especially if you already have a ton of religious trauma, you need to be careful about who you are giving a chance because words they say can haunt you for the rest of your life and/or put more doubts inside your head if you already struggle with that. Somebody on my mom’s side of the family told her that they did not want me coming around near their children bc it might confuse them… then the father of that person said that he doesn’t want to see me at all dressed in women’s clothes due to how it would be “hard for him” to see me like that. Those are extended family that said those, I also have a uncle who has always been like a close older brother to me that basically told me he wants nothing to do with my anymore. To be clear, this person was one of the closest people I had at the time, he was my uncle but we called all the time, played video games together, and even watched the same shows & movies. I could go on and on, but I love that you have had this interaction! ☺️☺️❤️❤️ I wish you the best of luck to your future relationships as well
A very heartwarming story. Until I read further, I thought it was going to go the other way
[removed]
I know what you mean about being afraid to tell certain people certain things. I’m a GAMP and a Witch. I’m more open about being a Witch, because I’m a High Priest and my wife and I run a spiritual group. But my love of trans women and my affinity for sometimes cross dressing, I’m afraid to tell some people. I doubt that those people will ever be on Reddit so I really feel comfortable here. I wish I could just tell the world who I really am but I have reservations. I wonder how many people would be as supportive as your friend turned out to be for you. I’m very sorry that you weren’t able to find that out for so long and that you may not have him around much longer. Life is short. It sucks in that way. Your story is touching and inspiring.
Of course:) it felt like something I should share here. Best of luck, stay safe
A similar variety of trauma is what trigger my initial panic attack when he messaged me. One such example is my mother. We went from speaking every day (despite living a couple thousand miles apart) to not speaking. At all. It was like that for a lot of people in my life. Most people actually. This was a nice break from that really
You remind me of a lot of folks I knew when I lived in the-middle-of-nowhere Wyoming. I mean that as a compliment, some of those people were among the best I’ve ever known. Thanks for the words friend, and take care"	uugkx8	trans	177	0.98	2022-05-21 05:34:18

I got a transphobe permanently banned!!		"I always report them, and usually, nothing happens. But this time, they actually took action. Bunch of transphobes down voting me, other trans people, and allies on that thread. Tossing them some up votes and down voting the transphobes would help. 💖

I recently got a transphobe banned, too. Good work!
Deleted my previous comment cause I figured it’s possible OP was actually supportive of trans people with their post. Shitty of the commenters to be so awful about it.
Yeah, I took the OP on that post to be supportive too. At least there is 1 less bigot on here now :)"	10v93as	trans	163	0.98	2023-02-06 15:16:33
Rejected by a cishet guy	"Today i went to the store to pick up something , as i was leaving a guy who saw me from the store asked for my number so we could possibly go on a date in his words "" you are a good looking woman and was wondering if your personality matches your good looks "" smooth af if you ask me.

I gave him my number and before planning a date i told him im trans via text for safety reasons and he told me "" sorry to inform you but this is an issue but it was nice meeting you"".
Honestly no matter how much im good at hiding that rejection doesn't hurt when they reject me for being trans it hurts in a special kind of way that makes me feel like a freak. 
It doesn't hurt if someone rejects me for superficial reasons like clothes , looks etc. but when they show interest and do a whole 180 turn after finding out about my medical history it just hurts always.

Im sorry for the rant i needed to vent somewhere."	"I’m so sorry for this. Clearly, he could not tell you are trans, so it sucks that he rejects you after finding out. Unfortunately, too many guys are so afraid of being perceived as anything less than totally hetero that they have this kind of reaction. I hope that one day we will be just people loving people. Unfortunately, I don’t expect to see that in my lifetime. 

Inside, I’m crying  to Queen’s “Find Me Somebody to Love”.
Ok BUT! Girl he thought you were hot. So take the positive and don't let his other feelings get to you. Just,ya,he asked for my number because he saw a pretty girl
I totally get guys or lesbian gals not wanting a trans woman, especially if she is pre op.  I get it, some people have preferences for genitalia.  But that doesn’t make it hurt any less.  I’ve experienced both guys and gals to reject me for for being transgender, some… both guys and gals, more guys than gals, said if I was pre op it would be okay.  That hurt even more as for very personal reason, I choose to be pre op even though I’d rather “it” be gone.  

I wish I had something to say that made you feel better, but I’ve been rejected by people that I really liked, connected with that I was both attracted to and thought I could spend a lifetime with.  Similar interests, professionally aligned with advanced professional careers etc.  all made it worse… I gave up on dating … 

Just keep your self worth…. Keep your standards and feel good about yourself on who you are and being true to yourself.   You are worth it.
Sounds like they wasn't the one sis
Sorry that happened. Rejection hurts. Sucks that people are so quick to dismiss or reject. You were obviously looking hot, so that's a positive! Sending support your way!
That sucks and of course it hurts. It's sad that in clinging so tightly to his frail ego and pathetic masculinity, he threw away an opportunity to meet a special somebody who's unique in her own way. His loss.
Girl, I feel ya. I’m sorry 😣
You'll find someone! I think you dodged a bullet though. Anyone who has a problem with you being trans is not worth keeping around
No every cishet guy want to date a trans woman, not a big deal
Rejection always stings, no matter the circumstance :( I’m so sorry you experienced this. I’d be hurt too. Being trans is absolute magic, and we need partners who see and love that magic. Never settle for less. Sending big hugs <3
I know it hurts. It's not at all comforting to just accept that people's orientations are part of who they are, even though it's true.

As an old broad trans woman, I can tell you it's possible to find love and companionship as a trans gal, but like with many other people who are not trans, it can take time.
[deleted]
Theres two versions of cishet guys that I meet.

One is okay. He just wants to have kids in the future. Or he is just sexually attracted to penises. Okay, I respect that.

The second and more common one is not. Just a fricking transphobe.
At least you passed.
That's definitely a big W. In my opinion anyway.
He will be back.... give him time.
Why not just not say anything? What we can see in the pics on your profile pass fantastically? I'm guessing it's just for the trans viability/ help squash some transphobic myths?
I’ll prob get downvoted but ever since surgery i haven’t told anybody and the cishet guys i did tell told me to never tell anyone again . You’re a woman now . But burn me at the stakes lol
Literal pass goals (to keep it positive here)
Can you elaborate on the ""orientation"" part ?
No he's not a bigot, sorry. Even if you think his preference comes from a place of ignorance, that's ignorance that he's entitled too. The guy just doesn't have a thing for trans people apparently and that should be respected. It's not like he was being an asshole about it either. He just doesn't find trans people attractive. Just because someone is not sexually or romantically attracted to transgender people doesn't make them transphobic.
That's the thing more people need to understand. My crush transitioned FTM and there was some intimacy between us, but it didnt work out for unrelated reasons. But I learned from him, and seeing other comments online that level headed trans people agree it's not transphobic to not be attracted/comfortable with someone pre-op. But then to still refuse someone like in some of these subreddits is transphobic. Some of the pics from some of the NSFW subreddits look better than what some cis women have.
No second chances even if he gets back I wouldn't go on a date with him , the train has left the station!
We shouldn't have to disclose our medical histories i agree cis women dont tell men before a date that they have pcos or that they are infertile or dont have a uterus. 
But we live in a world were if a man is transphobic and finds out our lives are in danger and i fought so hard to come to this point im not gonna risk it all just for some dick or mediocre sex.
I woud die to get asked for my number in public... If hes a jerk afterwards.. his loss!
You get it!! 💜
I should have been clearer. I meant sexual or romantic orientation.
He literamy rejected her cause she's trans and nothing else. Now best case he assumed op was pre or non op and has a genital preference. But the assumptions still transphobic. And again he gave op his number cause he was attracted to her untile he found out she was trans. Like come on what's that other then transphobic.

Literaly rejected her cause she's trans.
Trans women are women, a straight guy in a relationship with a trans woman is still straight
So what? It's a preference. Even if the reason is shallow like ""she's trans"" that needs to be respected. There doesn't need to be a reason if someone doesn't like someone else.
That is too simplistic an answer. I'm presuming he turned down the OP because he assumed she had a penis. Him not being interested in dating anyone with a penis is also straight.
Im post op and i pass he literally was all over me until he found out i was trans , i respect genital prefereces but now i was literally rejected because im trans not for my genitals since im post op. The only difference between me and a cis woman is that they have a uterus and biological kids is not an excuse to reject someone because even a cis woman can be infertile.

Thats the definition of transphobia being rejected because they don't want to be with you because you are trans dispite the fact that they are attracted to you.
But Why Though?

Like literaly what is the reasoning behind that being ok
So you are implying that a man dating a trans woman who has a penis is not straight ? Pretty sure thats what internalised transphobia looks like.

Regardless of genitalia a straight guy being attracted to a trans woman and dating her its a straight relationship.
Yes some people have genital preference fine but the ones who don't are still straight non op or pre op trans woman as just as much women as post op trans women and cis women.
That is incorrect. Orientation is about gender
I think we are agreeing, actually. I was including genital preference under the umbrella of orientation.

Almost all the men I have dated over the years were straight-identifying, so I certainly get it about them. I well remember the talks with the ones who wondered if they had to start calling themselves bisexual. I told them they didn't.

I did briefly date one man in the beginning who didn't know I was trans. It wasn't pleasant when I told him. I was even a chickenshit about it, telling him by email.

I didn't mean to start a side debate. I understand how you hurt, been there. I guess I just failed to say anything helpful. Sorry about that."	z6bke2	trans	144	0.97	2022-11-27 20:25:10
The BBC responded to my complaint about their transphobic article	"For full context on the article and the sort of complaint I made (and advice on how you can complain too!), please watch this video made by youtuber Shaun.

[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4buJMMiwcg&list=LL&index=7&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b4buJMMiwcg&list=LL&index=7&t=1s)

\---

My original complaint (copied and slightly edited from Luke Correia in the comment section of Shaun's video):

"" As stated by the BBC in an article on PinkNews, Chelsea Poe, a high-profile media figure and trans woman, was interviewed for this article. This proves that Caroline Lowbridge's statement ""\[no high-profile trans women\] wanted to speak to me but my editors and I felt it was important to reflect some of their views in this piece"", is an intentional and malicious lie.  


Chelsea Poe has also stated that she had warned Caroline Lowbridge about Lily Cade, a contributor to this article, who has since been removed from the article following her blog posts calling for the murder and sexual assault of trans women. This is alongside Lily Cade's prior history of sexually assaulting women, which she has admitted to doing long before this article was published.  


Given the harm that has been directly caused by platforming and legitimizing Lily Cade on BBC, alongside the flagrant disregard for the author or the editors to do their due diligence in checking the backgrounds of their contributors, the article should be amended if not outright removed.  


The article should, at the bare minimum, be changed to explicitly state that Chelsea Poe had been interviewed, and that Caroline Lowbridge and the BBC at large decided to omit her interview while lying about Chelsea Poe's involvement.  


If you care about journalistic integrity, honesty, and the safety of sexual assault survivors as much as your editing team currently pretends they do, the article should be removed entirely and followed up with a public apology for allowing such blatant hate and bigotry to have a platform through one of the largest news publications in the world.  ""

&#x200B;

The BBC's response:

""In preparing the article, the BBC conducted a number of interviews with a number of people over a number of months. However, it is commonplace for some interviewees, who may have been spoken to during the research stage, not to feature in the final version of an article due to a number of factors.  

As the article states, a number of high-profile commentators on this issue were contacted but declined to contribute. The definition of ‘high profile’ is clearly open to debate but the journalist considered it appropriately reflected the wider public profile of those she contacted and their track record in discussing transgender issues.  

There is no obligation upon the BBC to include a contributor purely on the basis that someone may wish us to do so, or indeed because a complaint about not having done so is received.""   

&#x200B;

\---

I responded back again: 

 ""Your response fails to adress the fact that the article features and intentional and malicious lie; the KEY component of my complaint.  

Caroline Lowbridge states: ""\[no high-profile trans women\] wanted to speak to me\[...\]"". This is a LIE, as proven by the fact that Chelsea Poe, a high-profile media figure and trans woman, was interviewed for this article. 

 Your response to my original complaint states both that a number of interviewees were cut for unspecified reasons AND that all contacted high-profile commentators declined to contribute. So, which is it? You are either LYING, or ADMITTING to willfully writing the article in a transphobic angle by excluding certain interviewees. 

 The definition of ""high-profile"" is certainly open to debate. This does NOT address the original complaint on why the interview with Chelsea Poe was excluded. Why is Chelsea Poe, an openly trans woman who has contributed to several media outlets such as Huffington Post and Glamour to name a few, not considered high-profile enough to feature as the viewpoint you disingenuously claim you felt it was important to reflect? 

 The statement that ""the definiton of 'high-profile' is clearly open to debate"" and ""there is no obligation upon the BBC to include a contributor purely on the basis that someone may wish us to do so"" is a transparent and malicious moving on the goalposts to try to be able to claim journalistic integrity. You are aware that you have been caught in a biased lie, and are now trying to shift the goalpost in order to remain technically correct.  

You have utterly failed to address my original complaint in any satisfactory way. The orignal BBC article, as it stands, is still a dishonest, harmful opinion piece written with an agenda and biased perspective, and to pretend it is anything else is a total failure of showing any journalistic integrity.  

The previous call to amend/remove the article and issue a public apology for platforming hate and bigotry still stands."" 

&#x200B;

\---

The BBC will never admit fault on this. They will try to squeeze by on technicalities and moving goalposts. The only thing we can do is to not support them and try to challenge them wherever possible."	"BBC is terfy antiscience that platforms hate speech. They should not be taken seriously ever.
Every head of the BBC should go ahead and choke on a BBC
I got the same response word-for-word. Guess they had to take a week to draft some bullshit up that doesn't even answer our complaint.
I mean, the Beebz platformed an admitted rapist and pedophile who called for literal lynching of trans women.  You think they're going to give any fucks whatsoever when a trans woman complains?
Would love a tally of the number of times they used the word ""number."" Did they even proofread their response? Seriously though, thank you for writing such an excellent and thought out email.
Yeah this is the same response they sent to everyone. So you know, they don’t respond to any responses you send them to their initial response. They did send me a survey though and I was very clear about how awful their answer was.

Cis people aren't the CEOs of gender	"throwaway bc obviously lol

TL;DR: nobody needs to look cis, not even cis people themselves.

&#x200B;

so I've noticed a trend not only in this subreddit but also in the trans community in general that ""passing"" is like the highest achievement of being trans. Passing as a cis person obviously. No one's asking if you pass for a gamer or if you pass as an engineer.

I can't help but wonder why? I genuinely think that ""passing"" as a cis person shouldn't be the ultimate goal of transitioning. In fact, I think people who are gnc and don't pass are bitchin' and lichterally the pillars of society.

Nobody needs to ""pass"" not even cis people themselves. In fact, the whole notion of ""passing"" seems like internalized transphobia and racism and fatphobia to me. When I thought I was like 1100% cis I didn't ""pass"" for cis. I'm fat and I'm not USAmerican White. I'm what people would call ""exotic"" and yet, I didn't pass 100% of the time. Not even with this hell of a rack I have.

One of my friends, who is a Black gnc person didn't ""pass"" as a woman because her nose is wide and her back is wide and they were constantly asked if they were a ""real woman.""

And let's not get into how transmasc people apparently need a beard to pass half of the time. A lot of native American cis men don't grow a beard naturally, they wear their hair long and they're still considered men. Except when it comes to White spaces where their masculinity will be questioned on account of their long hair.

And what about people who for safety reasons can't pass because they can't transition. Are they less trans because of it? Do nonbinary people have to look androgynous to be nonbinary? Not really, because gender presentation/performance is different from gender identity and I think we all know it right?

Do you see what I'm getting at? Thought? Opinions?

btw this is in no way meant to attack or invalidate people who want to pursue a physical transition or dismiss people who have suffered transphobia bc they dont pass. This is meant as food for thought on how we perceive the trans experience in general, but also to question our own biases when commenting on people's posts. Especially because most of the ""Do I pass?"" posts are made by wh1te people who ""pass"", so people who know they don't pass or who don't pass 100% of the time are looking at them and maybe even thinking to themselves ""well, I'll never look like that"". Hell, a lot of young people use reddit and they're looking at all these people who pass and internalizing all these ideas of what being trans means, instead of discovering it by themselves.

In the end, being trans is a deeply personal experience and no one can tell you how to be trans, but I think that aspiring to be cis shouldn't be ***it***, y'know?"	"Additionally, when I see someone in public who doesn't ""pass"" (i.e. is obviously a gnc person), it makes me feel a little safer. Like there's some sort of unspoken alliance just by existing near each other.

There's certainly something to be said for being able to go invisible in a group of people, but damnit I just extra appreciate those who are open and visible and proud.
True. Some people will never pass but they aren't lesser trans people because of it.
I'm openly trans to everyone in my life. I wear a trans flag dogtag, a trans flag lanyard, and find visibility very important. I also did everything in my power to be able to pass. The reason I did that is because part of my dysphoria was social. More than being misgendered, it was not being ""included in womanhood"" in people's minds unless they actively reminded themselves, and if you have to remind yourself that I'm a woman, then you're going to treat me differently. It others me from the social contexts and constructs of womanhood.

I pass these days, and it's a good place, because I'm still openly trans, but people don't need to remind themselves that I'm a woman, so I don't get ""othered"" in a thousand tiny ways like I used to.

I don't want to be cis. I don't want to be seen as cis.  I just want people to not have to mentally prompt themselves to include me in the category of my own gender.
In my experience there's a big gap between people who mostly interact in gay or trans subcultures and have a lot of gay and trans friends vs people who don't have those community connections (especially the ones who were straight-married before coming out). If you're in the former group, there's a lot less of a sense that \~\*\~passing\~\*\~ as cis is the goal compared to the latter group. Both of these are obviously competely valid ways to express your gender although on Reddit members of the latter group sometimes talk in ways that sound like internalized transphobia which is saddening.
The whole point of being trans is having gender incongruence. Most of us would give anything to be cis. Passing allows us to look in the mirror and see someone who looks cis, someone who matches what we see in our heads. It's also security and safety. Passing is a very very reasonable, understandable, logical, and commendable pursuit for a trans person. I do not personally understand the internal workings of anyone who desires to NOT pass but I obviously don't think less of them for it and I believe whatever path they desire to walk is fine and they should be able to do so, ideally in a society that is kind and accepting of all where they can be safe from harm. Passing isn't always the end all be all for everyone but posts that seem to disregard (unintentionally, I imagine) the immense gravity it holds on most trans people just kind of get to me sometimes.
I tend to agree agree but I also noticed you put passing at odds with being NGC which isn't necessarily the case. If I have a passing goal it would be to present as a man even in full femme drag so not everyones passing goals are just meant to conform with cisnormativity.
Fam I just don't want dysphoria and want to look pretty. Plus no harassment or misgendering.

It's not that deep.

I totally agree, but I’m too busy laughing at the title because it reminded me of the CEO of sex meme 😂😂😂
I totally agree that passing as cis doesn't have to be the goal. In fact, this site has a great article on this topic. 

https://www.transjoy.co/2021/10/04/why-passing-doesnt-define-your-transition/
As a trans single parent with mixed abilities from a mixed heritage blended family… I just want to send you endlesss unconditional community love and solidarity sibling for writing this. 

Trans liberation 💙
I agree with it all. I wish I could openly not pass more in public but it feels too dangerous. I’m non binary but would enjoy the option of passing as a cis woman because it would make life easier sometimes. Even though I’m not a woman (or a man)
I agree with the sentiment, but you lost me at racism and fatphobia. How is that relevant here?
Then what is the point of us being trans? If not to reach the male or female state we’ve been deprived of our whole lives. While I agree we don’t HAVE to “look” a certain way, don’t we? For the sake of our mental health, and to reach that physical state we were never allowed to fully express. I think non-binary ppl are very different from us in this conversation, they’re not trying to be male or female or present as fully one or the other. But we are trying to, we’ve always been trying to. Ofc those who can’t transition, I sympathize with, it can’t be helped and I feel horrible for them. But for those who can, isn’t that the point of it all? To reaffirm our identities. How we dress doesn’t really matter-not trying to say we have to wear the stereotypical dresses-don’t wanna play into misogyny or being sexist there. Also agree on the beard thing, definitely not needed, but it seems to help a lot of transmasc folks feel much more validated when they can grow one.

I think the issue we seem to face is that if we’re going to enter all these spaces, and let people know who we are, and live our truth, we need to look the part, which plays in our favor bc it’s so validating! Because we’ll never be cis, but getting as close to presenting as such has always been the goal has it not? I think if it isn’t, then maybe someone is more on the non-binary scope (which is totally fine!).
Nor are trans people
Thanks for that 🙏🏻
I agree. Whether or not you pass shouldn't matter. However, I want to pass. Not because society expects it. I want to pass for me. I want to feel like a girl and be treated like one.
One of my biggest issues as a trans guy is my height, because every white cis guy I know is taller than me, but a lot of men of color are even shorter than me. It’s something I definitely need to work on internally, but fucking hell do I wish dysphoria wasn’t so based on what the world sees in me
Thanks for saying this, I absolutely needed to hear this
I agree with what your saying. I don’t think anyone should feel like they have to pass based on social pressure from others. If someone is happy with how they look, even if they are not passing, that is more than enough. The biggest thing, in my opinion, is that the person is happy. For many trans people passing is what makes them most comfortable, for those who prefer a less (idk how to word but I guess I would say) “stereotypical” look of a male/female that is great. 

I know I personally prefer to pass. It makes me feel more comfortable. It also allows me to avoid awkward conversations. I seriously respect trans people who can talk about their experience and share. I just struggle to be one of those people. I hope one day to get there, and I’m trying my best to become more confident but until then I do prefer to pass. 

I do feel like the “do I pass” question is mostly asked by people just starting transitioning, and it’s understandable why. You are still figuring yourself out and sometimes what feels like the safest way to do that is to pass completely. 

To the trans people who are openly trans I love you guys. You make the stealth trans people feel safe and valid by just being around and that’s amazing. To those who are stealth I love you guys too and take your time to find out who you are!
being in a community with lots of trans people completely ruined my sense of what “passing” looks like. Half the cis people I meet, I “clock” as trans and then they’ll misgender me or say some dumbass cis nonsense and I’ll be like “damn. but ur the one that looks like a tr*nny”
The trans panic defense is a closely related legal strategy applied in cases of assault, manslaughter, or murder of a transgender individual with whom the assailant(s) had engaged in or was close to engaging in sexual relations with and claim to have been unaware that the victim was transgender,[1][2][5] producing in the attacker an alleged trans panic reaction, often a manifestation of homophobia and transphobia.[6][7]

straight from wikipedia pal

some people really need to study lgbtq+ history
trans people are the ceo of sex
Cis Black women get called men/man-like animal names as an insult, especially in the USA. Trans women of color experience this doubly so. Anti-blackness and racism is in our hair preferences, teachings on haircare, color schemes, and even the cut of our clothing. Fatphobia also has roots in anti-black rhetoric as well. 

Societal beauty standards that one ""must achieve to pass as a trans person"" are absolutely influenced by racism and fatphobia. Like shaving and bleaching ""requirements"" for example. Even things like OP posted about like nose and shoulder width are judged based off of racist or fatphobic tropes. I've literally seen so many posts like: ""hey am I allowed to be a transman if I'm brown/black/fat/etc? The only trans people I see are skinny and white""

I think an example of this type of thing happening in community is when Native American transmasculine people or transmen post about their transition/passing and people will start commenting like: ""You don't pass because your hair is long!! Gotta cut it OMG"" while completely glossing over how masc hair is done in that culture, and the USA/Canada has had a raunchy bad history of doing f-ed up things to their hair, so suggesting a cut is way out of line when put in context. Or when people will be talking about how 'feminine' full lips are, and how it keeps you from passing, when lots of POC have full lips on all genders, it's just a fetishized trait, so now it's associated with just women in pop culture when it's just....lips!

TL;Dr Trans people get told that to ""pass"" they need to live up to certain beauty standards. These standards are often rooted in racism and fatphobia, and so are even more difficult/damaging to achieve for POC/fat people/ disabled people/anyone who doesn't fit the ""perfect"" mold.
racism comes into play because beauty standards are typically eurocentric, but imo it’s more the effect of colonisation than just general racism
I'm reading Whipping Girl right now, and it addresses what you're bringing up. It's an excellent read and I recommend it.

A point she makes is that ""passing"" is not something the trans person does. The term ""passing"" is an oppressive term used to cover the fact that in a cis centric society everyone is gendering everyone constantly. If you meet all of a person's criteria and they condescend to gender you correctly, then you ""pass"". But that's shitty. That's them judging you. Fuck that. 

What trans people do when they transition is we attempt to resolve the gender dysphoria we are experiencing--not pass. That's about us and our self perception and we owe that judgey clerk at the supermarket that misgendered us nothing but a face full of spit. Our goal is not to get shitty people to gender us correctly. 

This is a subtle distinction to make but it's important. Feeling comfortable with your gender presentation and happy with who you see in the mirror is your job. 

""Passing"" is an oppressive game forced on you by a bigoted society. 

Think about what it meant/means for ""black"" people to pass as ""white"" in the states. First of all, the categories are all screwy, because the ""black"" person in question could have as much African American ancestry as a ""white"" person who's never had to think about ""passing"". Second of all, ""passing"" is not something that the person can actually do. It's a status conferred on them or not by each person they meet--and that status comes with the privileges that would be due anyone in a reasonable society.

That situation is obviously insane and oppressive. So is ours. We might be forced to play that game for fair treatment or safety, but we should not for one second fool ourselves into thinking that that's our game. That oppression. 

Even the word ""gender dysphoria"" conflates these two problems. Some of what we experience as gender dysphoria is all the social baggage dumped on us for being trans. The other part of it is internal gender incongruence.
For a lot of trans people, passing is a major goal, and that is completely fine and sometimes necessary for safety or a positive self-image. But passing is sure as hell not the overall ""point"" of being trans, and not trying to pass does not make someone non-binary. For a good illustration of this, just look at cis people. There are tons of butch women who do not try to look passing (and often get harassed just like trans people) or even explicitly try to not pass as women. That doesn't make them non-binary in any way, it's just how they present themselves; Vice versa for feminine men. Gender is not stored in the presentation, so to speak

TL;DR trans people can be GNC just like cis people can.
When you say ""different from us"", do you mean to say that non binary folks are not trans then?
The point of transition for me is addressing dysphoria and eliminating the suffering it causes me ; some of what this entails also has the side effect of making me pass for cis, and some of it has no bearing on whether I pass or not but still helps with dysphoria. I.e , I may be able to alleviate my dysphoria in ways that do not require me to pass for cis necessarily.
And to add more onto the fatphobia element, my partner is transmasc. His boobs are so big that binding does nothing. We live paycheck to paycheck, it's likely he won't afford top surgery for a long time. During that time, he's taken less seriously or told he isn't trying hard enough. The standard to ""pass"" to be taken seriously is bullcrap.

Also, I'm a transmasc who likes presenting feminine. Basically, I'm gnc. I've got the hairy legs, the facial hair, but I rock skirts and crop tops. I'm not taken as seriously for it. Not sure what point I'm making, if any, by sharing. P much, OP is right
Anyone insulting people for their looks is a complete ass.
Different cultures have different beauty standards, I do suppose that there is a certain eurocentrism to western beauty standards but this is to be expected given that we're majority white (especially in Europe). People of one race tend to prefer features of their own race and I don't think that this is necessarily racism in and of itself, in the same way that being gay doesn't mean you somehow hate the opposite sex.
I know that some trans ppl can Also be non-binary but if I’m being honest it’s very hard for me to wrap my head around it and I’ll often forget about it. When I said “different” it wasn’t meant in a negative way, just in a -I believe the context of this conversation in particular should be more steered towards trans people- but I’m always open to learning more and I’d hate to make anyone feel shitty. I just don’t like seeing conversations that would make more sense split up be grouped together when the experiences are so vastly different.
Eurocentric beauty standards (coming from a US standpoint) are a direct result of colonisation and racism. This isn’t a “people like people similar to them” thing. it’s a “POC historically were and still are treated as lesser than whites” thing.

Even asian beauty standards lean towards whiteness, despite white people being a minority in Asia. it’s partially colorism that has been ingrained in society for ages, and partially how there are so many rich white people people in media."	vxhfk9	trans	137	0.91	2022-07-12 18:01:13
Trouble with getting on T, what should I do?	"I just went to the doctor's this morning for a couple things bit one was to let my mom ask some questions about starting testosterone. The doctor suggested I wait until I turn 18. I feel extremely bummed and honestly wish I could just disappear. I've been wanting to get on testosterone for two years and people still act like it's a phase. I was told I could get in touch with a gender therapist if I give a month to think about it. What is there to think about!? I just want to be myself and be seen as myself, why should I wait any longer to have someone help me. I fear if I don't get on testosterone quick enough I might just give up. I feel so shitty. I want to be able to do what I want while still being a guy. Maybe the doctor meant no harm by it, but it can heavily sway my parents opinion. I can NOT wait another two years for testosterone, I honestly think I'd be risking my safety and happiness if I don't get on it soon enough. Is there anything I can do. My mom says her opinion relies on what my dad has to say so I have to somehow convince my skeptical father to allow me on testosterone. I don't see my dad caring or wanting me to get on T, he heavily believes in ""my body my choice"" but I don't believe he really believes that with certain situations, especially this one. Throughout my life I've had to convince my parents to let me do trivial things like start birth control, or cut my hair or get piercings, I've been able to get this done but it's been years of battling for certain things. And if I can't convince my dad to say the okay to my mom I'm not sure if I can continue. What do I do?"	"if you’re in the USA, you can start HRT with Planned Parenthood. you start within a week of the appointment from what i’ve seen.
You could try and find a second ""opinion"" or doctor. If you are in the US, I have heard some things about [https://getplume.co/](https://getplume.co/) (I am not in the US so can't answer any questions about it). Here in Canada, there are docs who can prescribe HRT without being your Family Doctor. Ask around, find some online support groups specific to where you are based and ask questions. You'll find a way and you are loved. If you have not already, find some youth groups you can make friends at and comfortably share you experience and feelings. Don't give up <3
Sounds like your parents are stubborn, but not completely opposed. You can try to convince your parents, in the meantime ask for hormone blockers maybe? You can also seek a second opinion, start by looking up clinics where you live that are trans friendly. Unfortunately, parents tend to believe doctors a lot more than their kids sometimes, so if you find one that’s trans friendly you might get a more favorable outcome. You might also come across as like you’re doing your due diligence by seeking another opinion which could look responsible in the eyes of your parents. Unfortunately, not sure if you have a lot of options under 18. They will come around, but the timeline blows.
I went to an informed consent practice, didn't have to prove myself and left with an Rx in hand. I'm in the south east US so I used transinthesouth to find them. I'm sure your area has a similar database where you can find actual trans friendly Drs.
Check if there’s any planned parenthood near you. If there is give them a call and ask if they do HRT. Let them know you’re wanting to start, they’ll tell you the next steps. Since you’re a minor you’ll need both parents consent if they’re both still in the picture. It’s a quick process. That’s how i started :).
If your parents don’t want to consent then you’ll have to wait until you’re 18 unfortunately. You can still go to planned parenthood for it when you’re 18, it’ll be a quicker process.
Seconding checking into your local Planned Parenthood. Depending on local laws, they may or may not be able to prescribe HRT for you but many of their locations operate on an incmformed consent basis; if you (or you and your parent/guardian if you're under 18) review the effects and sign some papers acknowledging this, they can prescribe your requested medications. 

Not every location does HRT though so you'll have to verify what's available and where.
DIY HRT is an option however it cost money which you might have to make yourself if your parents don’t approve. Also it is generally its just risky. But before doing anything I do recommend asking your parents because their support can mean a lot and possibly help you get T from a doctor. Obviously take my advice with a grain of salt because I’m just an internet stranger, best of luck brother
wow… like, a week out from the first visit wuth a therapist or… what? cause thats extremely quick :0
with QMED, i had my first appointment (online ofc) with their doctor and got the prescription for my first shot that same day. HIGHLY recommend QMED if possible
Time to move to the USA 💃💃
plume and folx aren’t available in all states, and require you to be at least 18
DIY usually isn't an option for trans mascs, as testosterone is a controlled substance and purchasing it without a prescription is illegal (at least in the US). Obviously illegality doesn't mean people don't do it, but it's much riskier, and not something to be recommended lightly. Especially to a minor.
For 18 and over, it's informed consent. For minors, parents or guardians would have to approve I believe.
Mine was prescribed on my initial visit. Did a phone call interview and 2 weeks later was my first appointment. Left with HRT. She apologized profusely for the 2 week wait, saying it usually doesn't take that long. I agree with other commenter thou, I'm sure you need to be 18 for informed consent.
is that in the Uk?
I'm under 18 but my mum is willing to consent to anything (as long as it isn't dangerous) and my dad is out of the picture so would they still give me it??
Thank you for clarifying! I didn't know the ins and outs.
You’re right, That’s true in many countries…UK is an exception if OP lives there because having unprescribed T is legal. However a better option than DIY that’s legal (in the US at least) is informed consent places like planned parenthood where you just sign, if OP wants I have a list of stuff for informed consent places for T (although again, it’s gonna be costly like any hrt access)
yes this is the case!!! :-)
If you’re under 18 your only option in the UK is [GenderGP](https://gendergp.com)
They've been great with me so far, there's been very little in the way of BS. 

I was not for waiting 4 years for an appointment through the NHS. I've been waiting 28 years for this, I'm not waiting another 4."	vzaso2	trans	134	0.98	2022-07-15 00:24:26

Reddit's Policy Update on Gender Identity and Advertising	"[Some of you may already be aware that Reddit has changed it's policy on self-diagnosed gender identity and advertising](https://www.reddit.com/r/reddit/comments/12boszd/policy_update_on_gender_identity_and_ads/), but either way we figured it may be worth giving some help regarding this change in general.

For data privacy reasons, in general we suggest _NOT_ sharing any of these details on your account, **ever**. The more you link your profile to who you are, the more easily it is for evil people to attack you, whether it's IRL, or via hacking your account. This includes sharing:

We trust Reddit as a corporation about as much as any of you do, which is to say not much, if at all. While individual Admins are great, and we've formed good bonds with a few of them, in general a corporation is an entity by itself.  
What we're trying to say is that with the data they gather from what you post and the data you hand out freely to them, there's a lot of unknowns in terms of what happens with your personal information. While we're sure they mostly use this data to more adequately target advertising, it's also entirely possible that it's used in other ways that we are unaware of.

Telling mum tomorrow... need some support! Can feel a transition tipping point coming.	"So I’m 28 mtf and have been transitioning for the past six months (in denial for 8 years).  I’m living overseas so I’ve been lucky to be able to control a lot of my ‘coming out’. I’ve been able to decide which friends know, been able to start using my real name professionally in my art career but stay ‘closeted’ at my other jobs for safety and convenience reasons. 

My University just processed my name change for my Masters degree yesterday and I got a new uni email address so a lot of people will start to find out very soon. 

I’ve started to feel more angst about lying to people who still know me as male than coming out which feels like a tipping point. I feel really horrible that my work friends don’t know because it feels like I’m deceiving them and there’s a walk between them and me because of this secret. 

I’m actually really excited about telling people though, but I’m super worried about my family. I feel like it’s such a huge shift in the way they see me that I’ve been avoiding talking to them at all. 

My sister has been really supportive (she’s bi and has a long term female partner so she has a bit of experience with my family - although she never came out to them, she asked me to do it for her! haha). So she’s going to talk to my mum after I do to help her debrief and to support me. 

I just can’t imagine saying the words to my mum or how I would even approach the subject and I’m pretty scared even though I know it’s something I need to do  

Just need a bit of courage to go through with it really. 

Sorry for the vent. Thanks to this community for helping me get to this point. I’m excited about the future for the first time in a long time and it’s all thanks to you guys! Xxxx

❤️



UPDATE: Everything went really well. I called her and when I said I had “important news” and asked her if she was somewhere private because it was sensitive she actually guessed!
She asked me if my girlfriend is supportive (which she is) and offered to make me a wedding dress ☺️🥰😂"	"I'm sure it will be all right.

Thanks! Here’s hoping xxxx

1. 40% is less than half. How could you think you're superior to other people if you can't even do simple math?

2. Attempt rate =/= suicide rate. The vast majority of people (both cis and trans) who attempt it don't actually do it.

Here we see the ""American Incel"" exploring outside of it's natural habitat. Usually this species stays in a particular corner of the internet, drooling over statistics about IQ and crime rates, but today it's feeling particularly brave.

Subsisting primarily on chicken tendies and breast milk, this species lives in it's mothers basement and has internalized issues involving masculinity and self esteem. Because of this, the species lashes out to show strength, hoping to ""trigger"" some ""SJW libtards"".

The species is currently being naturally replaced by chads of various racial and political backgrounds, and this brings about insecurities that show themselves as anger.  A fascinating species really, we need to study them before they go extinct.

I ran away from home in October. I am now an emotional wreck.	"I guess I just need to hear encouragement and advice from people who may have gone through similar things. I’m a trans man, pre-T and I turned 18 earlier this year. I had been outed to my mother, who in turn outed me to my father. He said that me believing I was bisexual and trans was a perversion and even compared my “sin” to being a pedophile. They later told my sister that I was possessed by a demon. Due to a heavy mixture of general and religious trauma, anxiety, emotional abuse from my parents and encouragement from my friends, I made the decision to leave my home a few months ago at the time of me writing this. The only person in my family who knew I was leaving was my sister.

I was only able to mail a few boxes worth of personal items to my new home, and carry a few bags worth of clothes with me. My parents tried to reach me many times during my journey, to the point where my sister had to text my girlfriend to reach me, and I can tell I had hurt them badly. They begged me to come back home so I could discuss this with them like an adult, and so that they could get one last hug from me. Of course, I didn’t go. This was a heavy talking point when I had to call them a few days after I’d arrived in my new home- and I only did that because they had been giving out my phone number and email to family members and were threatening to send out a missing person’s report if I didn’t speak to them. Now, between a phone, I felt safe enough to tell them that I would be legally changing my name as soon as possible. My dad… didn’t like that. I know I’ll have to have another talk like this eventually.

It hurts me to talk to them, but it hurts me even more to think I’ll never see them again. I miss my mother terribly. My older brother has only just now started to speak to me again, and my sister and I have only exchanged texts a few times since everything happened. I don’t talk to my dad at all if I can help it. I don’t know how to ask for them to address me as their son and their brother. I’ve been getting nightmares at night and I don’t sleep well anymore. I don’t really know what I can do to move forward with them- or if I ever can. I didn’t want to have to be the first out queer person in my family, and while I know I had to leave for my own safety, my mental health has just been absolutely destroyed. Whenever I think about them or I have to talk to them, I feel anxious, scared, and very sad. I cry often. I get depressed and homesick and I miss my old room. I don’t know what to do anymore and I wish my adult life didn’t have to start out like this"	"Oh, boy. First off, I'm sorry shit escalated to this level. Second off, a relative considering you a pedophile? That's my jurisdiction, *hello.* I do wanna say that I'm sorry for whatever you had to deal with - while my family *threatened* to send me to an exorcist, the threat was never fully realized, and to pretend otherwise would be both inconsiderate and ignorant of me. I do wanna say, however, that regardless of how drunk I am(very) it seems inconsiderate to acknowledge the difficulties you've gone through.

I'm sorry about your nightmares, I truly am. I think, though this is only one person's opinion, that it's absolutely normal to have nightmares after everything you've been through. The same goes for crying, and feeling anxiety. Life is tough, without everything you're going through, and expressing emotions however you will(through tears, anger, apathy, violence) is perfectly natural.
I admire your strength to have run away from the abuse. That is incredebly hard, you have every right to be emotionally drained after such an ordeal.  
It‘s natural that all of your thoughts are filled with your family rn, but if I can give advice that helped me heal- concentrate on yourself for a while.  Not the past, but the future. Like, do you want to start college soon? Or work a job that interests you? Wanna do anything to your current room to make it more comfortable? Took me a (too) long time to fully realize the amount of things I could *do*, instead of just accepting things that happen *to me*.  
It‘s going to get better, but it‘s a slow process. Any contact with your family is hard rn, but it‘s going to get easier.
I applaud your strength and willingness to walk away. The next step is to keep moving forward. 

Are you seeking therapy or counseling? I would reach out to people who do support you and let them know how you're doing. If money/insurance is a concern check local transgender groups who might know therapist who have pro bono or reduced rates for the uninsured.

You just had a massive shack up of your emotional support base and are feeling a lot vulnerabilities. Find the people who will move forward with you before worrying too much about how to drag the people you left out of their hole. 

Guilty is a powerful tool of manipulation don't let them tie you up with it. They wouldn't say such hurtful things if they truly wanted to help you. Find the people who will help you, the authentic ""You"", the ""You"" you know you should be. They can't understand the struggles you've gone through, the mental agony. To them it feels sudden and impulsive, they aren't trying to relate to you or understand you. Time might help them but first you must help yourself because they are only interested in helping themselves.
Using the fkn police to lure you back home so they can ""convert"" you? Disgusting. They are toxic to your mental health and physical safety. You may have to also cut your sister out of your life to prevent her from sharing your cell # with the parents.

Your parents are using psychological torture directly and vus your extended family. Damn I feel for you
hey man, first of all i'm proud of you for doing this. with the shit they told you cutting contact seems like the right course of action. i'm very sorry that things are still hard, it's completely understandable after what you've gone through. i've gone through something similar and i'll just share my experience with bits of advice.

i ran away from my folks in july. we've had a rocky relationship forever. i've been living with other people for about half a year at that point but due to financial reasons i was moving back in with my parents. i thought my relationship with my mom had improved since last i lived there but the shit they said to me on the first day i came back made me snap. ran away without even putting on fucking shoes. but it had to be done. i know that had i not run away i would've thrown myself out a window soon, taking that abuse from my parents would have killed me. that's why i'm proud you put yourself first in your situation. i implore you to remember that you didn't run away from your parents to ""hurt them"", you escaped a situation that was dangerous for you mental and physical health.


after a scary but mercifully brief period of homelessness i managed to move in my new place. but as soon as i could finally relax in this new apartment i fell the fuck apart. like the worst depression pit i've ever experienced. destroyed sleep schedule, nightmares about my father and no hope for better days in sight. it really shook me to realize that the people that put me on this earth without my consent, the people that are supposedly the ones who should help and protect me more than anyone else in the world would be so focused on their own comfort and ideas about how things ""should be"" that they would drive their child to suicide. i felt very alone and hurt. (and seeing how homeless people are treated firsthand left me with a fair bit of resentment towards people at large.) i'm still not sure how exactly i'm not in that awful pit anymore but i guess the few friends i have managed to keep me afloat long enough for me to start wanting to live again. you've been separated from the people that should have been your biggest supporters and protectors, it's not something anyone can just brush off. what helped me was seeing that other people care about me and will do things to help me. keeping friendships alive through this period is tricky however, remember that the better you communicate, the bigger the chance that your friendships will grow stronger and healthier. it's gonna be hard but a found family of people that truly love you is so worth it, people can overcome so much when they can rely on each other.

you said that you get homesick and miss your family. it's completely understandable, something has been ripped from your heart. you need to properly grieve the loss of that and be able to put it behind you. i'm no therapist so i can't be more helpful here, but looking into getting professional mental help is definitely something worth a look. therapy is stupid expensive for how vital it is for people, but a good professional can help you make sense of your feelings and help you work through traumas that keep you down. lgbtq+ orgs near you might have some counseling options, or at least contacts of specialists who are queer-friendly, there's probably other options too.

keep fighting. keep your friends close. remember that there are good people out there, it just might take a while to get to them. i hope this helped <3
I've been there, and I want you to know that it's going to get better from here. It's going to feel raw for awhile but try your best to push through. There are people out there who will love and support all of you, but you have to keep pushing forward.

 I still have a hard time sleeping regularly, but my nightmares are far less frequent than when I left. Try to find a therapist that specializes in traumatic experiences. They'll help you learn to cope with your past and move on. You also may qualify for some financial assistance from the government. These programs can help a lot if you do qualify. 

Hang in there man. I know it's all scary right now, but you're on the right path. I believe in you!
I would recommend therapy and if that doesn't help get a psychiatrist to prescribe prazosin off-label( its what helped treat my flashback nightmares that I get from having C-PTSD). 
I'm sorry you have to go through all of this. But family is the people that actually care about you and when your blood relations don't sometimes you end up having to make your own family out of friends.
my advice is to talk with them.  Raise your vibration before you do.  Remember not to let fear rule your life.  My daughter (17) to get out of the house went to drastic measures.  She ran to CPS and the police and accused her father and I of horrid abuse because she didn't like living with us anymore.  Now, for the 4th time we have CPS up our butt hole and my husband has a pending battery charge against him.  No abuse was ever done to her.  She likes to use the system for ""punishing us"" for us being too controlling.  The best advice I can give to you is that your family loves you.  They may not understand and may not ever understand what you are going through but they love you just the same.  If you are living your life authentically you have nothing to fear or be ashamed of.  Coming from a mother's veiw....anytime she blocked me from the truth or hid anything from me robbed me of truly knowing my daughter.  She didn't let me see her or get to know her by either lying, avoiding or omitting.  I would rather her have spoken her truth authentically than be avoided and lied to.  Your family misses you and they're probably worried.  Give someone a call and just let them know that your ok and tell them how you feel.  Keep it light.  Life is supposed to ebb and flow with all of the situations and all the emotions.  There's a reason why we have to go through something.  You can't go over, under or around...only through to the other side.  Only then are we wiser.    Much love.  I'll be thinking about you.
The violence option seems more appealing every day.

Seriously though, it all feels so… abrupt. I was supposed to have been in college by now. Now I’m thousands of miles away from my family and I’m living in a place where people use the right name for me, but the quality of life overall is so astronomically different. I don’t know when I’ll feel like I’m ‘home’ again. I don’t even know if getting my own place is going to fix it. It really hurts
Right now my plans are to stay put and work. In about a year I’ll be able to afford my own apartment, and my girlfriend and I have been talking about moving in together after she’s done with college. I want to get a car and I’d like to be able to own a cat. Perhaps someday I can think about going back to college to pursue a degree in Graphic Design, but for now I’ll just continue to work on my silly animatics in the meantime. And of course, as soon as I can start working, I’m going to look into starting HRT

I’m trying to look forward to the future. I just know it’ll be a long time before I can move past everything that happened to me in the last year
I just wanted to let you know I think about this reply a lot. And I'm trying. God I'm trying
You might never feel like you're home again. Uh, again, sorry for my bluntness, but yeah! Sometimes you have to choose between being physically ""comfortable"" or choosing to be around people who respect you as you are, using the right pronouns for you and shit. There are probably going to be situations where you have to choose between being respected as a human being and having a comfortable place to sleep(and, of course, everyone would choose something different - neither option is necessarily bad, I'm just pointing out you might not have both).

I *am* sorry you were forced into this sorta situation, though. I know it's not great - I've had to choose between the people who raised me and being fed the next day. It's not great, but I bet you'll get out of it.
Hsjqhsjajhsj maybe not the *best* choice of words but I get what you mean. I’m doing what I can. I know that’s really all I can do right now.
Hey i know i came out of nowhere, but i just wanted to say thank you for the advice cuz your advice applies to my situation too. So thank you
I’m a trans girl who moved 3000 miles from where I grew up to live as myself. And even after that it took me almost 3 years to work past the trauma, fear and shame to finally be out as myself and start 2022 as me.

It’s hard. But it does get better. Home is where your heart is. My heart is here, with me, my partner, my friend group, my chosen family.

I’m 10 years older than you, and I can tell you for a fact, it can and will get better but only if you take care of yourself. 

You made the right choice. You deserve and NEED to be respected. My family is crazy and religious and my father (the only non-religious person in the family) is the only person I talk to. It hurt for a long time but….

Trans people get a unique chance to REALLY see people. Their true selves, as twisted, hateful, fearful as that might be. This hurts us sometimes, but I’m grateful for it too. When I presented straight Christian male, I could see how fake everything and everyone was. Trapped by illusions and falsehoods, propaganda and they wanna say WE are the delusional ones??? Fuck I’m glad I am 3000 miles away from that conservative dumpster fire.

It’s hard now bro, but it gets better. My messages are open if you ever need advice.
3000 miles is 4828.03 km

Shaving on E is some sort of blessed witchcraft	"I genuinely never thought it was humanly possible to shave your legs without bumps or irritation. This is actually mind blowing and my worldview has collapsed.

Using a safety razor has also helped a LOT as-well. With some advice from r/feminineboys since shaving is probably the second most common question there

AND THE HAIR. I no longer feel bad for not shaving for a day or two, or a week, or a month, as I feel the motivation to do it draining from my soul knowing it'll take hours and won't even look good for longer than a day

Now it takes around a week for it to get to the point I want to shave again, and it only takes an hour or so max. I find myself actually \*wanting\* it to grow faster so I can shave again and get that sweet, sweet gender euphoria induced serotonin

PLUS IT'S SO SOFT. My skin doesn't feel like the carpet I spilled pepsi on yesterday anymore!!

Even though I've been on E for 8/.5 months, it's still really the beginning because it's only been a month & half that I've been on a regular dose. And this has to be my favorite effect I'm finally starting to notice!

I was, and still am a bit bummed that things weren't going fast enough, but the wheels are starting to turn and smooth legs are keeping me going rn"	"Love ❤️ love ❤️ love ❤️ this!!!
God, reading these posts just makes me so excited for when I actually start E. Happy for you!
Smooth legs are nice and all, but _smooth cheeks_ after laser sessions, good god ❤
It's apparently one of the first effects you notice too! Best of luck to you ❤️❤️❤️
GOD I wish, one day"	qpdcn2	trans	69	1.0	2021-11-08 13:12:44
"Don't Underestimate the ""Heightened Emotions"" Side Effect"	"  So I got my first t shot on Friday, June 24th.  If you don't know, that's the day they overturned Roe v. Wade.  I didn't find out until several hours later, but man did I lose it.  It was everywhere and the only escape was to get off of the internet, which I foolishly didn't  think of.   The anxiety was so bad that I became suicidal and had myself admitted to inpatient psychiatric care for my own safety.  There were other stressors over the past couple weeks, but I know myself well enough to know that I wouldn't have crashed that badly if it weren't for that side effect.

  I have lots of coping mechanisms and years of practice at successfully using them but it wasn't enough.  It was like I was sixteen all over again.  I was NOT prepared for that, and I went in overconfident in my ability to manage my emotions, not helped by the fact that I didn't take it very seriously BECAUSE I thought I could handle it.

  So maybe avoid potentially triggering content after the first few shots until you get used to the way you react to things on t."	"I'm sorry you had to go through that but I'm glad to hear you are ok. And yeah post injection mood swings are intense and not to be underestimated. I'm not sure if the same can be said for T injections, but after the first month of E injections my hormone levels started to stabilize and my mood swings became far less intense.
Yeah, unfortunately testosterone mood swings are very intense and come entirely without warning.
my mood was destabilized for the first month of t. it was pretty bad flipping to irritability , anger, sadness, hopeless to random bouts of euphoria  throw in there. it gets better the further you go into it.
Yeah, I'd heard it's less bad in second puberty than in the first go-around, and I took that to mean less intense, rather than less long-lasting.  Oops.  I'm glad this happened now, rather than later, at least now I know what I'm in for and won't get cocky.

I took a mood stabiliser when I was younger and decided to resume it in the hospital and that's helped a lot.  My second t shot yesterday had no mood swings.  Hopefully it'll curb the ""increase aggression"" side effect as well, once that comes along.
Yeah, not looking forward to it, but I resumed a mood stabiliser that worked for me in the past while I was in the hospital, so hopefully that'll negate the worst of it.
When I got home after my first shot, I bounced around the house, cleaning like I've heard is common of people on crack.  I was a bundle of energy.  Later that evening, I was browsing YouTube and saw the news.  My mood tanked.  Not the best first day, but better sooner than later.  Thanks to my hospital stay, I was able to find a working sleeping medication, live as an out trans man and make a new friend for the first time in my life, so I'd say I came out of it on top.  It wasn't a bad experience in my eyes, just a learning experience.  I'm glad to know it won't last very long, though.  Being fully out for the first time was eye-opening in the best way, as well."	vpqvwt	trans	69	0.97	2022-07-02 12:36:45
I've started a one-person charity project to provide trans people clothes for free. Please take a look!	"&#x200B;

[ The Trans Closet is a personal fundraising project run by one non-binary individual, which aims to provide trans people with beginning their transition by providing them clothes for their preferred presentation style. ](https://preview.redd.it/kzwva6xxf1061.png?width=1800&format=png&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3c907b082ec93d7690c796020aa76c202cbed4e0)

[https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/](https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/)

[https://twitter.com/transscloset](https://twitter.com/transscloset)

The goal is to provide one full day outfit (tops, bottoms, and socks) and one set of pajamas to trans people (more specifically minors, but adults are more than welcomed too!) who otherwise cannot afford to begin a new wardrobe or wouldn't be able to have access to such items because of their family situation. Each package works on a $100ish budget, so any additional requests that are made after what's already promised will be squeezed into there as much as possible.

Binders ARE an option, and will be guaranteed to be in the packages if requested, even if it goes a bit over budget. Same for bras. The only clothes I'm currently not willing to include is underwear, as I don't exactly feel comfortable picking that out for strangers, let alone minors. BUT everything else is fair game (you can even request shoes, makeup, or anything you can think of!). \[EDIT: After some consideration, underwear is a possibility - though we'll be going very generic with it via bulk on Amazon, so check out the wishlist if you wish to help with that specifically\]

I've already planned ahead for safety concerns, so please don't be afraid to request one if your situation's a more closeted one. You can request your items to be shipped within a backpack or other nondescript item for concealment, and chose how much pride items can be included, what the name is on the shipping label, etc. I want this to be accessible to as many people as possible!

I am accepting donations, but I've designed this to be able to be done out of my own pocket, so please don't feel pressured to do so. For now, I'm taking in request forms for the next month or so, and will begin fulfilling them at the start of January 2021 at the very latest. Please share this with anyone who you think could benefit!

EDIT: Since so many people have been offering clothes, I want to clarify that for the most part, I'm not taking a ton of donated clothes. I don't have a lot of space for it where I live currently and the main idea is that the clothes people get still feel very ""new"", or at least not super well lived in. But since so many have offered, you're welcome to DM me if you have clothes in good condition. I'll be revising the donation page on the website too to clarify things.

**EDIT 2: We haven't even gone 24 hours yet, and already the outpouring of support has been incredible! I've already exceeded the amount of requests I thought I'd ever get. I'd like to be able to fill these out faster if at all possible, so if you'd like to help, please check out** [**https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/#donate**](https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/#donate) **! I'm accepting physical donations of clothes and makeup (new), as well as Amazon wishlist items, Ko-Fi donations, and gift card donations. If there's some other way you think you can help, then please message me! I'm open to hearing ideas on how to get some more support.**"	"Please dm me I have a lot of masc clothes that are in decent enough shape to donate. 

I would love to help.
Congrats, that’s a great cause, I wish more people did cool things like this!
Aw no way I’ve just gave 4 bags of my old clothes away to charity too
You are doing God’s work my friend :)
Would you be able to ship somewhere like Mexico?
done!
thank you!! i'm honestly very excited to get started on this. i had assumed this was something someone was already doing but i found nothing, so if i can fill a niche i'm happy to do so <3
that's totally fine! it's going to help someone for sure even if its not specifically for this purpose.
thank you! that's very sweet of you to say. hopefully in the future, this sort of thing won't be considered so abnormal - normalizing caring for each other would make the world a nicer place to be in.
hi! totally an option, though as it states on the site (i think unless i forgot to) it might take me longer when i get to you on the list just because shippings a bit pricier. but international requests are 100% okay
I hope the goes well! I would donate but quarantine has got be running out of (presentable) clothes already, and I like not being nude all the time...
It’s a really nice thing that you’re doing regardless 😊 hope it takes off. I remember when I just started HRT, I was tempted to ask if anyone wanted to do a clothes swap 😂 I could still do with some new clothes now lmao
Thank you so much for what you’re doing, the world needs more people like you <3
yeah, please don't go nude for charity sakdjAKDJ we're not really helping if someone goes without for someone else to not go without
if you're struggling financially to put together your wardrobe, you can totally put in a form! you might be lower on the priority list but i can add you on.
thank you! that's really sweet of you to say. <3
Aw that would be amazing. Thank you 🥰
[https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/](https://thetranscloset.carrd.co/) just go to here and hit the big ""submit a request form"" button, and you can go through it. don't worry about requesting too much or asking for wilder stuff.
Wilder stuff 😂 I don’t even want to know what some people are requesting
oh nothing risque kasdJ i'm still only at one applicant and their requests were very tame. i just mean more along the lines of if there's an item or accessory you want that not really needed but would make you happy, then you can throw it on there."	jwkwy9	trans	65	0.93	2020-11-18 18:11:07
Do I Pass? Any advice? (Face covered because dysphoria and personal safety. Wearing breast forms, stick on bra to create cleavage, and shapewear to help create an hourglass shape.)		"You definitely do! Look beautiful ❤️.
Absolutely great body 😍
you absolutely pass! you look really nice 💙
Face is a huge part of passing, so it's really impossible to say without that or knowing your approximate height (if you're 6'4"" you're fucked for instance). Your body looks like it won't be a huge issue, kinda big shoulders but that alone won't make or break someone normally, but maybe try to wear clothing that helps hide it.
Last I checked I was no taller than 5’10”. Any suggestions for clothes?
Bi colored shirts/hoodies work pretty well (similar to this) http://www.rosevictorian.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/black-moschino-bi-colour-t-shirt-womens-tops-black_1.jpg
As long as it has dark sleeves/shoulders it helps make that area look a bit smaller. It only goes so far obviously but it may help."	c06fbf	trans	65	0.96	2019-06-13 14:22:13
I'm Afraid	"I feel like a lot of the more outspoken transpeople have an uncompromising ""I don't care about your cis feelings"" attitude that can sometimes come off as unthankfulness or ambivalence towards cis allies. Although I want to avoid pandering to transphobes I want cispeople to know how much their opinion affect transpeople. 

So I want the world to know that I'm always afraid that my safety and my position in society will be attacked. I'm terrified that trans acceptance is a trend and will soon die out. I'm scared of people seeing my trans identity as an extreme mental disorder that renders me incapable of rationality. I'm afraid that I will never be taken seriously. I'm afraid that nobody believes me. I'm afraid that I'll never be able to have a life unencumbered by my trans identity. I'm afraid that I will create or enforce negative stereotypes of transpeople. I'm afraid that I will always live under a stereotype. I'm afraid that nobody in a mathematics field understands gender identity and vice versa so I'll be stuck in the middle I'm afraid.  "	"You are not alone, you just share the same fears of many of us. Have  hug from me and probably all the other people here too. Don't let your life be controlled by your fears. Hugs and best wishes.
For me, being trans isn't my defining characteristic, and I think cis folk appreciate that. I work with a bunch of Trump-loving righties and I think I surprised them after coming out just how normal I am.

Be yourself, whatever that may be. People can like it or not, and that's okay.
Don’t worry. I’m a white cis male with pansexual friends and I see what oppression they go through. Don’t worry. Everything will be ok. It can be hard, I’m brand new to reddit and I’ve already have been called a troll for my viewpoints, but it gets better. We will win!
To me it's not about asserting my dominance or telling people that I don't care what they think of me. It's knowing that, no matter what someone may say or do to me, I know who I am, and I will stand by my identity. Nobody can take that from me. Of course I'm afraid of what can happen to me for it, but if something does happen, at least I can say that I was true to myself.
Wow this is so me
I share these fears, especially seeing the wave of backlash washing over the US. It helps to have a clear-eyed view, not focused on only the worst elements. You will be surrounded by a mix of people: some whose support for trans people is genuine and fierce, some who loathe us and may never come around, many who have knee-jerk reactions that they easily abandon when they meet a real life trans person, and many who have just not thought much about us at all. I'm trying to say that it will not be all or nothing, there will be ups and downs, and take refuge as much as you need to.
The transfolk you are talking about in the first paragraph are a loud minority. The majority of us just live our lives and the fact we are trans is just something about us like the fact we have a certain eye colour, or are a certain height.

Sure, it can be something others notice, or changes whether someone finds you attractive (which can be sucky, for sure), but it doesn't DEFINE you. I am trans... I'm also a scientist, a musician, someone who likes playing video and board games, enjoys physical activity. What makes me me is the combination of  ALL of those things, not just one of them.

If you view that as an 'I don't care about your cis feelings' vibe, then I can't change our view of that - but I've been passing now for a year or 2 (started transitioning in 2012). People haven't changed how they've treated me. That is, with kindness and basic respect, because I haven't changed how I've acted.

We understand the fear. You are not alone. Just be sure to let yourself be who you really are. Life is for living, after all! If you think people in a maths field won't understand transpeople, you're probably wrong. There are a fair few trans people in STEM and in the programming community. Maths is not going to be an exception to this. You will be able to live your life, should you choose to, despite the ups and downs that it may take to get there.

I'm finally getting a binder!	For context I'm a nonbinary transmasc person who's still in their early teens. I have very supportive parents (I'm very lucky for this and am so grateful to them) but nonetheless have been scared to bring stuff up about things that can help with my dysphoria. Yesterday I built up the courage and asked if we could get a binder! I had been thinking about this for a while and doing research on binder safety and some nice binders on Amazon and settled on one. My mom was super nice about it when I brought it up and we weren't sure if we should do the small or the medium even after measuring so she got both sizes! I'm super happy and so so so thankful. It's arriving next Monday and I couldn't be more excited! 😁	"what does a binder do
Awesome, just ordered my first binder too, really excited. I'm 30, bit of a late blumer lol. One thing I saw in my research is that for exercise you should go a size up, so if you are lucky with getting two sizes one will be good for normal wear and the other for exercise or later if you are still growing.
I'm really jealous, I hope it gives you lots of gender euphoria!! :))
Congrats!! Remember to bind safely!
It hold your loose paper together
It pushes back your breasts and makes your chest look flat/flatter. Which is great for me since my chest causes me a lot of dysphoria. 😁
A binder is something that helps flatten someone’s breasts and gives them a more masculine/flat chest, which helps a lot of transmasc people with their dysphoria
In my opinion it's never too late. I didn't know that it was good to use a size up for exercise so thanks for the info! And yeah that's another reason why I'm really thankful my mom got two since I'm pretty sure I'm not done growing and ordering a new one later would be a bit of a hassle. Probably not a huge hassle but it's still nice that it should give me more time until I have to get a new one. 😁
Thank you so much! I hope yours does too! 😁
Thank you so much! And I will; I've done a ton of research and am aware of the possible risks if I don't so even if I may not want to I am ready and prepared to responsibly bind as soon as next Monday comes around. Even if that means taking the binder off before I want to! 😁 (I can't wait for next Monday which is a sentence I never thought I'd say lol)
Glad you’re prepared, and I’m excited for Monday for you! :D"	mpylcs	trans	61	0.95	2021-04-13 09:13:09

Girls, I need help, what’s the best way to shave your face?	So I’m an almost 20 yo trans girl, I haven’t started HRT yet (will start in January) and I have a big problem. In the morning I carefully shave my face with a normal safety razor blade, after shaving my face looks clean without any fur (except for my eyebrows and lashes) but at the afternoon (around 4pm) I already have a little bit of beard and that gives me a lot of dysphoria. What is the best way of shaving to avoid this?	"I keep a small battery powered electric shaver in my purse, and around 3pm I give it a touch up. The shaving gives me a little bit of dysphoria, but I feel much better after I'm done.
Honestly with a laser, especially if you're starting HRT soon - laser is more effective while your beard is thicker and darker and less so after you start hormones.

Failing that, I used to do two passes with a three blade men's razor - with the grain then against - followed by moisturizer, primer to smooth everything out and color corrector before regular  makeup routine.

For me, two sessions of laser got me to the point where the only shadow was my moustache, after four I could skip the primer and color corrector and just use tinted moisturiser without the need for other makeup
I think laser is probably the way to go if you can access it, but if not you can bring a small electric razor with you when you go out and you can touch up the shave half way through the day. It doesn't take very long at all since there's so little hair at that point and you can use an electric for it to avoid cutting yourself.
I use Harry's. I do two to three pass overs finishing against the grain. I also use concealer first then foundation over.
I find manual razors terrible to use; my skin is sensitive and stretchy so if I want a clean shave I need to accept some cuts, or go so slowly that it takes a long time. This was exacerbated when u started HRT and my skin got much softer.

I use an electric foil razor, for my skin this gives a closer shave than anything else I've tried, it's much faster, easier to use and I've not cut myself once yet. I use it regularly, mostly every other day. I can highly recommend picking one up as an alternative if you don't like using manual razors, one of my favourite transition purchases.
Definitely I think you should consider laser (&/or electrolysis depending on your hair) electrolysis hurts a LOT laser is very easy imo but both have given me better results than shaving with a razor. That being said it still definitely takes time and patience with your skin
I exfoliate then shave in the direction the hair grows then apply shaving cream again and shave against it after I use aftershave and once the pain is gone I use makeup to cover up anything visible under the skin. 

Also found out that there are conditions that affect cis women (like my mom) that make them grow facial hair which helped a bit when I miss a bit of hair.
All types of laser treatments and also Eflora cream works.
Shaving causes inflammation / irritation of the skin, the repetitive inflammation of cells, called “inflammaging”, would be one of the main causes of skin aging.
1: exfoliate in the shower, hot water opens pores

2: shave in the shower or immediately after

3: use only clean, sharp, high quality razors

4: moisturize

5: Exfoliate again before bed

6: moisturize again before bed

Laser is preferable to electrolysis bc laser requires less sessions and therefore less pain. Unless you're blonde like me then RIP its electrolysis only. Hope this helps
I have the same issue as you! Have you tried using an epilator? It can be painful to use on the face but if you’re careful then its not that bad. It’s like a razor but plucks the hairs instead of shaving them so usually for me they wont be noticeable for another week or so
I'm AFAB and have the exact same issue. Surprisingly many AFAB/cis women have the same issue!

Personally I have a JML purse sized electronic razor in my bag. It's pretty crap but it keeps the stubble at bay, I shave every morning at 8am using my husbands electric razor (proper babiliss razor most men use) and moisturise then as it grows back over the day I use the JML razor to keep it clean shaven.
Depends on your skin and sensibilities but I got the best results when shaving once with the grain and another run against the grain
[deleted]
I’d try waxing since shaving might lead to cuts or uneven shaving, while waxing will make it so that it takes longer for the hair to grow back (I believe, not exactly sure)
I use a double edged safety razor with a good quality blade. One pass following the path of growth, rewet my face or put more shaving cream on- second pass sideways through the path of growth, and then the third pass rewet/reapply cream and go against the grain/path of growth. It may take upwards of 30 minutes, but you will have less noticeable 5 o clock shadow.
I did the cheap version. Tweezers and go on. Everytime it took more time to regrown. After month it takes about 5 days to make a dark spot, and at 6 im able to pluck again. Im not on HRT 22 yo.
No amount of shaving will slow regrowth, I'm having laser hair removal to tackle my moustache & beard while waiting for HRT. It's expensive but shop around, I used Wowcher (UK) & got a brilliant price for a course of laser, I've had 7 sessions so far & have seriously reduced shadow & much less regrowth
That’s a good idea, re shaving during the day just like you redo your makeup, thank you.
I considered doing lazer before but thought it wasn’t worth it, tho that was 2 years ago, now a day it grows a way faster, so I will consider it again. Also thank you for the shaving advice, it will be really helpful in the mean time
Thank you, I will consider lazer, in the mean time, do you have any suggestions of a good electrical shaver? I have an epilator that I use for the body, but it’s not battery powered, plus, I think epilator on the face would hurt a lot.
Thank you
Do you have a recommendation? I tried electric razors before and it hasn’t been a great experience so far.
For what I have seen eletrólise is more painful and need more sessions but is permanent, while lazer isn’t really permanent but helps a lot and I could get ride of beard in around 4 sessions. I will do some more research and see which one is better for me
I never used Exfoliant before, maybe I should give it a try. The only problem is this seams quite big for a daily routine
What’s eflora cream?
Normally I use a good shaving foam/cream and hot water on the blade to avoid irritation, but thanks, I will look out for it
For when you start facial hair removal..

1: drink a gallon of water beforehand

2: load up on aspirin and ibuprofen

3: get tktx brand numbing cream, its the strongest I've found

4: apply a thick layer on the area 1 hour before treatment, cover it with plastic wrap so it doesn't dry out

If that's still not enough you can legally buy kratom and dxm and that usually does it for me if all else fails
Thank you! Will try it today, and also thanks for the advice to prepare for lazer.
Wait whuh? Plz explain why blonde does not work with laser.

If it's true... do u have room in your grave?
Signed- a dumb blonde
I use an epilator for the body, but never tried it on the face
Intresting, thanks for the advice, I will look into it
Thank you for the tutorial, I use makeup often, but didn’t knew how to properly cover it without calling for even more attention (by getting the skin on that area a different colour than the rest and things like that)
Thank you
What is Cheal versio? I try looking it up on Google but it autocorrects to “cheap version”
i should do the same...
In the first few years of my transition laser was the single most impactful thing I did to get me to where I wanted to be. The difference it makes in your day to day life is enormous
It might not be applicable, different skin types seem to do better with different methods.

Electric trimmers will never give a close shave, and I don't know without more specific info from you, but this is what people usually refer to when talking about electric razors. They have their place but won't give a close shave.

Search for foil razors, I've had good success with Braun and Phillips brands. I usually do a once over with a foil razor, then go back through for the stubborn hairs that were missed and do small circular motions to remove them.

Like I said, I've found this to be the most consistent, and quickest, way to get a clean shave. I don't see people talk about foil razors much so it makes me think it's not a good option for a lot of people.
I go to a place that does both & my first appointment was a lot of looking at my face up close to figure out the best treatment and we wound up doing a combination, I think if you find one like that as well that’s your best option as there’s a lot of smaller factors regarding your hair and skin that a professional is very helpful with knowing.
It can be a pain sometimes to do. Usually if I shave in the morning I skip exfoliation. For work I shave the night before in the shower with a waterproof mirror and just use makeup in the morning to cover up the stubble keeps it short and hard to see plus covid masks kinda helped my confidence. 

At the same time all skin is different so you might find say an electric razor might work better but makeup really helps hide it regardless
It is a cream for woman’s facial growth. It is for trans and cis woman who have facial hair growth. It will slow down the growth . If you use it with an at home laser or get professional laser hair removal it will work even better. You can order a bunch on a website called All Day Chemist. Google it. Apply it once in the morning and once at night. Wait 5 minutes after shaving tho.
Laser works best on light complexion dark hair. And the darker your complexion or lighter your hair the less effective it is because it targets the contrast. Blonde as described is basically no contrast so no effect.
Imagine a hot sunny day. Now imagine your clothes are all black. That's the best explanation I got
No problem! This will buy you extra time between shaves, but you may still need to do it daily if your facial hair grows fast.
I think that's what they meant.
sorry, thats my spelling mistake
Thank you!
Oh, ok, I thought it was the name of an eletrical shaver or something
It’s ok, thank you for the tip
it's seem that is Revlon Mini Tweezer Set To Go, just tweezers.

Actually the best way is to pull out the hairs and not to shave them, moreover shaving damages the skin, worse under HRT the skin is thinner and more fragile.  
therefore prefer the tearing (tweezers, hot wax, ...) even if at the beginning it is more painful
Noted, thank you
Hand pluck all of your beard hairs? No there has to be better ways
hot wax, tweezers for finishing, after a few years there is not much hair left.

the sooner we start the better, the less the hairs will grow, will be finer and finer, hair removal will be faster and easier, the most important thing is to avoid shaving"	ypzql9	trans	58	0.94	2022-11-08 21:53:11
I was denied a job because of my transitioning.	"Hi, friends!

So, just as the title states, I was denied a very nice job opportunity due to the fact that I am transitioning.

And I haven’t really figured out how to process that, or how or what to go about doing about it. 

It was for an account executive role, with lots of responsibility and overseeing several stores. I did two interviews, a working interview, and then a third and final interview.

After my working interview, I met with my would-be supervisor to discuss how it went, my findings, etc.

It was then that he let me know that I was the perfect candidate for this role, my qualifications fit great, and he would hire me today…except for that I was transitioning, and he wasn’t sure about my safety in the role. He said that if I lived anywhere else but the state I lived in, he would hire me. Apparently some of the clientele that I would be working with,  come with a very heavy dudebro environment. He also mentioned that he thought of this the night before my working interview, which means that he let me do it anyway, knowing that he wasn’t going to hire me.

So I don’t really know what to think. Is he actually looking out for me? Was it just transphobic? Do I wait for this opportunity to come again in a state that I would want to live in? Do I take the whole company down and dine on top of the ashes of what once was?

Let me know your thoughts.

tl;dr - I was denied an executive role due to my transition, but was told I was the perfect candidate"	"That’s literally illegal and it sounds like he tried to play it off as him being in your corner which is just deeply insidious. It’s not up to him whether or not you’re up for that environment, it’s up to you. Burn it to the ground babe. I’m so sorry you had to encounter that right now x
If they were on your side they would inform you that it might be an issue with clientele, but leave the choice up to you to accept or decline the position.

As far as abbie goes, I really don't know what I would think and feel in this situation, so no recommendations here.
Make your own informed choice what to do about it, and best wishes and hugs from me
Now I don't know the law where you live, but where I am that would be considered discrimination on par with racism etc. and would be enough to file a lawsuit
Illegal AF, sue them into the ground
honestly, bullet dodged. if they weren’t willing to go to bat for you now, they wouldn’t in the future, so them doing this, while definitely shitty gives you insight enough into them to know that they would suck as an employer.


as far as taking legal action? idk. i’d ask them over on r/legaladvice but i don’t really trust the law to help me/have the time to deal with litigation. 

it’s definitely shitty and sucks, sorry.
You should get any and all info pertaining to this in front of a local advocacy group or lawyer asap, they can help with sitations like this

How tf does a company fuck up the most basic stuff like EEOC, AND also completely admit to violating it?
That’s horrible! Discrimination is a fact of life for us. What happened to you doesn’t sound legal, but it might be more painful to try and litigate it, bc it sounds like it’s a he said/she said situation. I’ve had quite a few interviews where I’ve felt being trans was at least part of why I didn’t get hired and it’s hard to process. Also, try to gtfo of whatever shitty state you’re in, because any GOP-led state would criminalise our existence if they could. Most blue states that I’m aware of have some solid statute intended to protect us from discrimination. 

My honest opinion is to try your best to let it go knowing that an unjust part of being trans is knowing people are going to treat you like trash. They key is not to listen to it, nor let it affect who you are. People suck; let them be Miserable people and kill them with kindness.

I don't believe this is due to the company being transphobic. There are known reports of certain states having much higher rates of transphobic murder, and the company wouldn't want to handle an employee being murdered. If you want to follow the legal route of 'sue them under federal law' go ahead, but i believe that they were covering their appearance as much as making sure you don't get shot in the mouth for being trans.
If an employee got killed while working, by a client, how do you think that makes the company looks?
Similarly,
Do you want to run the risk of running into a fanatic transphobe, and getting murdered for no reason other than the fact you're transitioning and picked a job that put you in that position?

It's probably better for both you and the company if the company appeared transphobic than if they gave you the job and you got killed
This is just about the most blatant case of workplace transphobia, and it is absolutely giant civil rights violation. You absolutely ought to take these fuckers down.

If you didn't record the conversation, transcribe it in detail from memory immediately--with a date, time, length of conversation and the person with whom you chatted. 

Call the nearest U-S attorney's office, and set up an interview. Do it now. Don't wait til Monday. Then contact the nearest LGBTQIA+ Center and set up an interview with one of THEIR attorneys. Again, do it now.

Please, PLEASE don't this go. We trans people need to start fighting for our rights, and the only way we can do that is to make an example of the people who think it's OK to do horrible shit like this to people like you. 

Us!!

Now that we have a sympathetic administration in place, this kind of action will NOT be allowed to stand. 

WE HAVE TO STAND UP FOR WHOM WE ARE!!!

Look, I was in television news for 30+ years. This is a HUGE story--and has the makings of a landmark case. 

I beg you: FIGHT FOR YOUR RIGHTS AS A PERSON AND AS A TRANSGENDER PERSON!!!!

And yes, I am screaming at you in print!!! This is a big fucking deal. Your fight is OUR fight.l 

If you wanna talk about this in depth, please DM me. Or text. 707-640-0876

Many blessings and be strong!!!

Maybe reach out to The Sylvia Rivera Law Project in NYC, they don’t deal with employment discrimination cases but they can refer you to the right people as far as lawyers and governmental agencies that will investigate anti-trans bias. It’s a trans led org so you know the girls will look after you x
~~It's not literally illegal in all states in the US. Plenty don't have anti-discrimination laws that protect trans folks.~~

~~https://www.hrc.org/resources/state-equality-index~~

~~If OP *is* in a state that protects against this kind of discrimination then there's potential for a lawsuit here. But, the burden of proof falls on OP. It's not typically easy to prove, and it sounds like this was only ever spoken. The hiring manager would only need to deny that comment. There's likely no paper trail to subpoena.~~

~~This situation really really sucks. ~~

~~OP I feel for you. If you have the means and are up for a move, looking for work in a state that grants protection might be the way to go.~~

~~Hopefully some day we'll get federal protection and things will change for the better everywhere.~~

Ignore all that. Title VII in the civil rights act protects us against this as the other commenter pointed out below. OP should sue.
Actually whether or not the state has anti-discrimination laws in place, if the employer maintains a staff of at least 15 employees OP would generally be protected under federal anti-discrimination laws (Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964). The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) would generally launch an investigation to establish proof through interviewing current employees, visiting the facility, reviewing documents, etc. so the burden of proof does not fall 100% on OP by any means.

https://www.eeoc.gov/fact-sheet/federal-laws-prohibiting-job-discrimination-questions-and-answers
Ooo, you're correct and I am wrong. I forgot that title VII recently gained transgender status as part of the sex clause. OP should bring a suit. 

The proof will be some work, but with what was described it seems like OP was very well qualified. If hiring manager recorded all the good marks, or they didn't immediately hire a similarly experienced candidate it might be feasible to prove. Interviews and such would make that even stronger!
They don’t make the legal system in this country confusing & verging on impossible to navigate alone by mistake. But yes 100%, it wouldn’t be a clearcut thing to prove but very much worth it. Cases like this move us forward little by little and if OP can collect a bag in the process I think we’re all here for that 😌"	ouvyvl	trans	51	0.96	2021-07-30 23:03:32
Checking up on everyone again as your trans dad	"Hey, i know that everything is chaotic and stressing but there are people here for you to talk to, im sure there are hundreds of people that are more than willing to help.

My Ukrainian children, im sorry that this situation is happening. You have people to support you, Polands borders are open. Take care of yourself and *get somewhere safe*, i love you kids. Its all gonna work out, just get to safety. We will all do the best we can to help you.

My texan trans kids. Hey, i know life feels like pure hell, like a nightmare maybe. But it’s going to be okay, im sure this whole thing will be fixed soon. Lots of people are working towards stopping this whole thing Greg Abbott started. Just stay safe and stay in the closet, for your safety. I know its going to be hard and im sorry, but its for your safety.

Everyone else thats having problems, im open to help you. Your wonderful amazing people, take care of yourself. Drink water, eat food. Take breaks when your stressed, your a human person same as all of us and humans aren’t machines (heck even machines need breaks) take breaks when you need them. 

Everyone im always open to giving encouragement, dad jokes, and anything i can do to help. Need someone to call you your pronouns? Absolutely, i would love to! Need advice? I’ll do my best. Need a crisis hotline? My personal favorite 741-741!"	"[removed]
Thank you I need that and my pronouns are she/her and just came out and struggling really bad
Thanks for supportive chill dad vibes. Sincerely your late 20s daughter. Doing good all in all. Seriously I feel the estrogen shaving years off it's great!
No problem
Your an amazing woman, and i am proud of you and how you have dealt with your problems. Are you comfortable with headpats and good girl?
Im glad your doing well
[removed]
Yes head pats are good
Sure am all in all. Minor health things. And lack of $$ lol. Dentist appointment in a couple of days. Stuck on benefit since omicron took my job. Also waiting on hernia operation surgery list is long about a year. So I'm just happy aside that enjoying my transition
No problem :)

What do sprinters eat before a race? Nothing they fast.

my partner and i are so afraid of living in the US…	"hi ive never posted here before but im just hoping to get some support and release some of this emotion,,,

my partner (20) and i (19) have been together for over a year now, and we’ve been seeing America decline in real time , and with SCOTUS doing all this crazy shit it’s really starting to take a toll on us. He is a mostly cis-white man and im a pre-everything trans man, and we both view the world in an extremely queer light. 

Last night i was woken up by a call from him late at night. he was crying and telling me how much he wants to keep me safe from the world and to be able to express myself however i want. We started to talk about how dangerous society could start to be for me as a trans man, and that from his perspective the government is going to make a huge and rapid decline, that it’s quite possible i’ll never be able to change my name/get on hormones/top surgery. (he has always been extremely political on the leftist side) 

it means so much to me that he cares about me and my safety and happiness enough to cry, and we’ve even started talking of ways to move out of the US as soon as possible … but we both have zero money of course … 

i’m not really sure how to end this, but if anyone has kind words or advice for me/us id really appreciate it :’)"	"My state of NC has been great for trans people, just this year alone the state has passed 3 positive laws protecting trans people!
Don't let them break you. Don't stop being you. The whole world is watching in terror hoping you will get your rights back, hoping you will get justice. Never settle for this bullcrap. Keep fighting, keep voting. 

But most importantly don't give up on yourself ever.
As a British person who moved to America: there are some extremely worrying things happening here, obviously. But America seems very much a place of extremes, good and bad. I have seen openness and community demonstrated here that I never saw in England. 
I also think the structure of the US in States can be something of a bonus. Say you live in Texas. You can move! Leave to a much more trans friendly state in terms of legislation and a more friendly area. If you're in a European country and they changed the law, you're stuck in that country. 
Not saying moving is easy or simple. It absolutely isn't. But there are both bad and very good places here, and real differences if you live in one compared to another.
My insurance covers all my meds, and currently covers bottom surgery (I'm mtf), and I'm sure covers top surgery for FtM here in California.
Muy advice Is to start preparing for leaving the US, in case things get worse, because honestly I don't see that the Dems are actually trying to help women or trans people.
Yeah our country ls beginning to lose its core values
It's  who you are   I don't understand the problem!!!!!!!!!!
Washington state is very LGBTQ friendly I got on HRT hormones within 3 weeks after my first appointment with Planned Parenthood  I had virtual video appointment my first time and second visit was in person. She just asked me some questions about my gender identity and when I started identifying as trans woman. And took my blood work for future results. So got the hormones sent to my Walmart pharmacy. Had check up month after being on hrt everything went good and she upped my doses. Got another appointment 3 months 🙂👍🏳️‍⚧️ Hope you and your boyfriend find right place for you guys 💖🏳️‍🌈
Um? I'm sorry, but the United States is gon n a be one of the safest countries for trans persons. And this same scotus also just extended discrimination protections to gay and trans persons. This reads as just a flame post
Same here with Delaware! We even have a trans woman senator who passed a bunch of anti discrimination laws for trans people
I've also heard Colorado is one of the best states for trans people
thank you so much ❤️
I'm in Washington state and same with me everything is covered by insurance 🙏🏳️‍⚧️💖
… people like you who are saying everything is fine is the reason things continue to not improve. i currently live in florida, in a pretty politically charged city, and everytime i go outside im afraid of getting confronted with trans/homophobia :/
YES colorado is absolutely amazing when ut comes to lgbt stuff, i can add that minnesota is rather good too!
Fantastic! If anything happens in Washington, you won't have far to travel to California, lol.
I'm sorry, but the word fine was where in my reply? -thought so. Go build your bubble and live in it because there are assholes everywhere. When you're a hammer then everything in the world looks like a nail."	vnmace	trans	50	0.94	2022-06-29 18:13:15
Parents told me they think I shouldn't have children	"Trans guy here. 17. My parental units have been looking into surgery options for me (without me asking them to) to try and be supportive, and while I'm grateful for it, I mostly feel like I have no choices with my body. They hate my name, too, and don't call me by it even though everyone else does- they stick with the first time I chose in a panic. That's besides the point though.

Finally put my foot down and told them I don't want any surgeries until I have my own biological child that I've carried. I'm totally down with fostering and adopting a child, but I also really want to experience being pregnant because I think it's fucking awesome and hardcore. I'm totally down to be someone's surrogate, too, though I also want to breastfeed my own child. So I don't want any surgeries that would interfere with any of my reproductive organs.

Anyways, when I explained this to them, they immediately shut me down. Their reasoning was due to safety and legal rights given the political climate in the US, particularly our state, but it felt like a punch in the gut. They suggested talking to family members who'd be willing to carry my embryos, but I don't want that. I'm really hurt for their quick dismissal. I tried to reason with them by giving them my vague plan. I'd be willing to travel anywhere that would guarantee my safety as a pregnant trans man in the future, but they wouldn't listen and kept telling me, ""You shouldn't have children.""

I'm really hurt by this. I know I might seem a little obsessed with being able to conceive, and maybe I am, but it's what I want. It's what I've wanted for a long time. And maybe I'll change my mind in the future, which is totally cool, but I want the option for a while. My parents are a little controlling of my transition in general and I'm just tired + angry. Don't know what to do.

Sorry for the rant. I'm not sure if there's any solution to this or words that could be said to make me feel better. Maybe I should be grateful my parents are supportive, but they're weird about it sometimes."	"They totally overstepped your boundaries in a gross way, it‘s okay to be angered by that, mate.  
Your body and reproduction is your decision and yours alone.  
As ColThig2 said, ignore them and do not let them pressure you into anything.
Parents don’t get to make choices, just don’t expect them to help.
Ignore them
Not okay on your parents part, clearly you are old enought to make your own plans.  


Somehow I get the feeling they have not yet processed the thought of you transitioning and are still stuch at the ""Our child is going through this and we need to do all we can to help"" kinda mindset.   


Maybe you could try to talk to them about, you haveing to manage, your very own kinda grownup problems and I you want advice or need help, you will ask them? Not talking about anything specifically, but the fact that they are deciding about Your life without including You in it.
NOBODY SHOULD BE IN CONTROL OF YOUR TRANSITION BUT YOU. It is YOUR transition. Also surgery is scary af
I got pregnant long before I realised I was trans, but if I hadn't had my son then I think I'd want the option too, at least until I knew 100% that I didn't want kids of my own. This is your choice, for you and your body. This isn't something your parents can force on you.

If you haven't already, the seahorse dads subreddit is a great resource for trans-masc people to read up on being pregnant as a man and a great place for support.
Are you on hormones already? If so then their justification is probably that they don’t want you holding children while you’re actively altering your body chemistry, which isn’t too outlandish.
Do what you want and is best for you, some people may disagree at first but will come around, and those that don't can fuck off lmao. That's what I always try to keep in mind when I feel pressure from others.
And being pregnant and having a baby is also scary af even though it is badass (I've done it twice. Both difficult pregnancies but no regrets) but only YOU have the control of these things
Both are super scary! but I think I'm more afraid of the top surgery videos I've seen where every single surgeon literally rips them out 😭 If I may ask, were either of your pregnancies while you were IDing as trans/nb or before? If before, how do you look at those experiences now? 

Sorry if those are intrusive, feel free not to share. I don't get to talk to many transmasc parents/people who happened to bear children. btw your hair is fantastic
I don't mind sharing but are you ok with me DMing you to share? It's just a lot for comment sections lol
Yeah, of course! Just keep in mind I'm really bad at replying to DMs, I apologize in advance
Totally understandable
I just sent you a very long one about my experience, current experience and how I feel about things"	vq000f	trans	49	0.95	2022-07-02 20:07:31
Hi, I’m Ashley Lilith, and I am trans woman (33mtf)	"I have no idea how to start any of this. I think this will be a long one. There is so much to say. 

My egg cracked a few weeks ago. I first came out to my wife (32f) as pansexual. Then a few days later I came out saying I think I want to be a woman. My wife is part of the rainbow team, and she is very supportive. We’ve had conversations about it since. I am a massive lurker online and don’t really comment on anything (i think I am extremely socially anxious even online, and I also think I am autistic/ahhd but that’s not what this post is about). 
	I’ve been reading posts across a few lgbt/trans sub reddits. I’ve been learning so much reading everyones journeys and questions and answers. My wife suggested for me to make a post when I first came out but I said I wasn’t ready yet, even through an anon account. Today I’ve found the courage to start sharing a part of my life’s journey…. (omg, my eyes are tearing up, wtf… I’ve always forced myself not to cry because men don’t cry, right?)

I hope that I will share more as I continue this journey. I also hope the read that follows is not an incomprehensible mess of words.

I’ve spent the last few weeks reflecting upon things. I’ve been making small steps. Picking a new name was the first. My wife helped because I didn’t want to choose a new name she didn’t like. We both like my new name. I’ve spent time reflecting upon all the feelings and thoughts I’ve had over my life which I pushed down because I thought I was a weird person, or I made myself believe what I was thinking or feeling is wrong. Now I’ve learned normal people think about what it’s like to be a girl/woman, or wanting to be a woman, as often as I think about what it’s like to be a bird. (Spoiler alert, I’ve thought about being a bird maybe 3 times).

Since coming out I’ve been stressing over giving up my perceived manliness, which is, in a way, just a fabrication at the end of the day. In the last few days, I have noticed that I am ok with that, I want to be me and I want to be happy. I have decided that I do want to completely transition but at the same time I am unsure I want bottom surgery (this is probably a separate post). What is also scary and exciting is the part where I get to learn and be a woman.

I shaved my legs a couple of days ago and I freaking love the feel. I was so dysphoric about my legs, but after shaving them and seeing my skin for the first time, I kind of like them. I always told my wife I don’t mind if she doesn’t shave, I know it’s normal to have body hair, and I stand by that. But for me, never again (as annoying as it is, 100% worth!) 
	I’ve also been growing my nails out for the last few weeks, and I did my best first attempt at applying nail polish. They are a bit messed up, some cracked in the first hour of drying 🤷‍♀️ and I’ve dinged them a bit. But omg! I love them so much, so happy with it :) can’t wait for them to get longer, and get better at nail care.

I also bought womens silky pajamas yesterday, light pink with greeny flower patterns. I was so excited for it. The shorts are perfect but of course I don’t really fit in the top. My upper body is my dysphoria, including my head. Big fat muscles, I am close to 100kg. I love muscles but the way. When it comes to muscly men I think “good job, well done”. But I am so jealous of muscly women, give me your body! (Or just any women tbh). Maybe I will be a muscly mommy. 
	Over the last fews weeks I think I’ve come to realise that I will be ok with losing my large build and strength. I know it will be worth it. I can continue with my fitness journey regardless, I just won’t be as strong or big and I am ok with that. I also thing it was part of my dysphoria, trying to fit in as a man. If I am big, strong and muscly then I must be a man right? 
	Oh this point, and back to my perceived masculinity. I have thought about the dangers. I’ve never directly witnessed any of it. It is a bit scary. I will be giving up my white male safety privilege. 
	I would like to add that I don’t have my male body, nor do I hate being a man. I don’t love it either. If my choice was taken away from me, I could continue to live as a man. But I don’t think I can find my true happiness until I am complete woman.

I’ve already made contact with a local trans friendly health centre. At the time I said I was still thinking about whether I want to transition. Over the last few days I made the decision that it is what I want 100%, and I will be seeking to start HRT asap. I am planning on getting laser hair removal asap as well. But unsure if I should wait until after I’ve been on HRT for some x period of time.

I’ve only come out directly to two people. My wife and the person at the clinic. I plan to come out to my wife’s brother and his fiancé when it feels right. They are both part of the LGBTQIA+ community, but it’s still very scary. I haven’t made plans about coming out to the rest of my or my wife’s family yet. Or at work. Weirdly enough, coming out at work has me the most anxious.

I can’t believe I am trans. I would have never thought this as my teenage self. There was so little exposure to this when I was growing up. Everything seems so grey looking back, so dreary. Even my high school uniforms where literally grey, with just a splash of yellow or gold. 

I think I will finish up. I don’t want to turn this into a book.

P.S. I wanted to share a picture I drew the day after I came out as trans, but apparently you can’t do picture posts with descriptions on reddit because of reasons. So I’ll post that separately another time. It’s not fancy or anything, but made me happy. My wife said to me she has noticed I am more open and just in general more happy since I’ve come out.

TL;dr; I am trans. I want to be a woman. I am going to be a woman. I am a woman."	"Aw this made me tear up just reading it! I'm so happy for you! It is a hell of a thing to come out of the closet and out of denial and open yourself up to other people. So congrats girl!
Hi Ashley! Congrats on making the first step! So happy for you! If you have any HRT or transition questions feel free to message me!
This was such a delight to read, I’m so happy for you Ashley!
Hi Ashley, I’m Ashley! Great name :). Glad you’re finding yourself, and glad you have a supportive partner.
Hi Ashley, beautiful name 🥰🥰💕

Welcome to your big journey 🫂🫂🫂🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍⚧️
I'm very happy for you but I'm just in love with the use of ""rainbow team"" lol
I'm very excited for you Ashley! I'm just a smol trans guy on the internet and I teared up reading this. It reminds me of the summer before my senior year of high school (which was literally August of 2021 lol) when I finally cracked my egg. Realizing that I wasn't going to be truly happy as a woman was a big first step for me. Going at first was hard but now that I've moved out of state for college and have been able to socially transition properly it's been so worth it to get through the harder baby steps and there's still more hard steps for me to take. I'm happy that you have such a supportive wife at your side. Having people like that in your life is gonna make things a lot better. It's all gonna go up from here. I'm sending you all of my well wishes on your journey. :)
Thank you so much :) I was so scared to come out. I can't believe how much of a relief it is to finally be out. Can't express how happy I am to be called a girl!
Hi, thank you :) I will definitely keep that in mind. There is so much, I am trying not to overwhelm myself.
:) Thank you. I was so anxious that I am just dumping too much out there. But there is so much I have to say.
Omg! Hi Ashley! It is such a great name! Thank you so much. I am so ready to fully discovery myself. :) :)
I'm also an Ashley from Australia. Hi Ashley's :)
Thank you so much, I do love it. :) I am going to try to be brave and share more as I progress :) :)
Thank you :) haha it is so great, and it just makes sense. Everyone should use it. And someone should make a someone should make a rainbow team banner with characters representing everyone. :)
Thank you so much for sharing with me :) I am so happy for you. I wish you all the best, and that every steps gets easier. But it will be so worth it 🫂🏳️‍⚧️ I am very new at all of this but feel free to reach out if you ever feel like talking.

My boyfriend calls me boyfriend	"I'm nonbinary and go by they/he. Im also afab and present super feminine, think long nails and skirts 24/7. This has caused nearly everyone in my life to call me she/her. Even all my past partners call me girlfriend. But my current boyfriend? He's the only one to ever call me boyfriend. He says it with such ease. He's never identified as queer either and has had more ease with it than my partners in the past who have. He's just so in love with who I am as a person he doesn't care. He would rather see me happy by saying ""i love my boyfriend"" than question it. I still remember the first time i got the text ""i love my boyfriend"". At that point he'd said ""my boy"" but he never said boyfriend in full. I ended up crying happily in my uni's library by myself. Today he said on face time ""i want to introduce them (his extended family) to my boyfriend"" and I cried again. On his birthday when his parents called me girlfriend he said “partner is fine”. He gives me a sense of safety and euphoria I've never felt. Even after 5 years of drag and 7 years of all queer friend groups, he makes me feel safety and validity i never thought possible. He truly makes me feel like my (lack of) gender doesn't matter because I'm just a person with him. And there's many amazing things about him other than this like nerdy hobbies, fashion, our communication styles, our wants in life, etc! I always found the saying ""when you know you know"" when it came to finding ""the one"" cheesy. Thats until i randomly bumped into him in the park during a basketball festival. He's my fairytale love. If you ever read this dear, just know i never intended for you to, just a late night gush to the void of the internet, but you changed my perspective on love forever <3

TL;DR My boyfriend is my gender safe space and is the first to call me boyfriend"	"I hope everyone on this sub finds someone like your boyfriend. I'm happy for both of you.

(Can you clone him or something? :D)
The void hears you and loves you for it!
Marry this manz! There are so many bad partners out there, he's definetly a keeper!
He seems like an amazing person and I'm happy for you two
yaaas!! <3 Im so happy to hear this, it's so beautiful! My boyfriend recently introduced me to his classmates as his boyfriend and I felt so gushy and valid I wanted to get all excited and hug him but I didn't at that time XD Gotta act pro.  
But after the class I was so gushy LMFAO. And now he calls me Boyfriend, lill mans, baby mans, cute mans, etc. Just because he enjoys seeing how happy I get about it ;0; It's such a good feeling and I'm so glad there are others that are like that! Not everyone, but it really gives hope for the lot of us <3
wish i could cause then I’d have 2 of him :(
thank you!! im glad the void appreciated my need to appreciate him to the void
definitely my plan! we both want marriage years and years later since we’re still in our 20’s but as of rn we both have voiced we want to eachother to be endgame which is so refreshing:)
HECK YA!! I’m so glad u feel the same way dude!! i think everyone deserves a suppositive and gender euphoric partner its such a different type of validation to be loved so deeply non cis gender identity and all. its v lovely u have that u deserve it !! im so happy for u too!  <3 ! )•u•(
Noo we need hundreds, no thousands!!
u can have 200 if we find a way to clone him"	yv4gqi	trans	45	0.92	2022-11-14 16:27:49

# Every day I post an instance where /r/the_donald harassed or threatened violence against transgender individuals. Here's the subreddit stalking and harassing one individual person. 

The subreddit /r/the_donald found a photo of a person and then stalked and harassed this person. This person was just a bystander who they targeted because they believed they have the appearance of transgender person and they think they are ""ugly"". This person may not even be transgender but /r/the_donald labelled this person as transgender as bigoted motivation to stalk and harass them. No one deserves this.

This has clearly escalated way out of control. The subreddit started a hate campaign against a random bystander and promoted finding this person and taking photos and videos of them. This is dangerous behavior. This is more than a violation of site rules. This is a violation of an individual's personal safety. Something needs to be done to stop this.

Holy shit. How has reddit not gotten rid of this? This is blatant harassment as well as doxxing"	53i1sa	trans	46	0.91	2016-09-19 15:19:49
Transfems, how do you avoid breaking out when shaving body hair?	I've tried multiple different methods to get rid of body hair, all of which either were a pain to do or straight up didn't work (Nair, epilation, electric trimmers, disposable razors). I recently bought a safety razor which definitely made the process easier and it's probably what I'll continue to use until I have access to laser. Every time I shave with it though, (this also happened with disposable razors) I get a ton of acne and ingrown hairs that refuse to go away for weeks at a time, even after using acne body wash twice a day in the shower. I'm already prone to acne regardless and this just makes it worse. It doesn't seem to make a difference whether I wash the areas before or after shaving. It also makes it much harder to find the motivation to shave on time since I don't want to make the breakout worse than it already is. Does anybody else have this issue and if so, have you found a way to help prevent it?	"Shaving usually involves hot water which will open your pores and allow stuff in. When you're finished shaving, wash the area and then rinse with cold water to encourage the pores to shrink back down
i dont bother going for a clean shave anymore, its just more work than its worth for me lol. i just buzz my body with my electric razor every week or so. the only spot i get consistent breakouts is my chest though, but hey, im wearing a shirt 99% of the time so its not a big deal either

what kind of electric razor did you have before? its possible it was designed specifically for facial hair only, so its motor might not have been strong enough to do body hair consistently
Idk im a trans guy and i shave my legs (bc i wear dresses and my mom gets rude) and my legs always break out, i think its about the pressure. My legs break out less when i gently press down, unfortunately it leaves a slightly hairy feeling texture
I personally prefer an electric foil razor. It's easier on my skin. It's just not as close as some of the others. I think I've got a Braun series 5 which works well enough
when you shave (or whichever process you use), make sure to wash your face afterwards and scrub it gently with a shower poof or a coarse washcloth. Edit: also use face wash!
Make sure you exfoliate before, rinse out the razor after each pass and shave the direction you hair in growing in.
I have big issues with this. I shave WITH the hair, not against. Not as close a shave but far less irritated. Trimmer for legs above the knees, as sitting + sweat = irritation (especially back of thighs). 

Chest, pits, face, and below knees are my spots I really care about as they have the greatest chance of public showing. Everything else just keeps short with electric trimmer.
Full send and drop $8,000 on electrolysis permanent facial hair removal like me 🥲🥲🥲 I’m still crying.. and broke but at least no facial hair.
I very specific method I learned from my mother.

Fill a bathtub with hot water and baby oil. Soak in it for 15+ minutes, then shave with a two sided safety razor using the oily water. I pass over the area once with one side, then pass over it again with the other side to get a pretty smooth shave. I do it as quickly as possible, not overly focusing on getting it exactly right.

It's not only fast, it doesn't result in as many red bumps / in grown hairs because the oil stops it from cutting the hair bellow the skin line. (I think that's what's going on)

Do not use this method on your face. I tend to use shaving soap to shave my face, with the same razor but a fresh blade.

Don't use the same blade you use on your body on your face, it gets duller much faster, and still works when much duller. A clean sharp blade makes a big difference on the face.
Usually when shaving hair I wash with just warm water first, shave and then wash with warm water and soap. Make sure to dry off nooks and crannies as much as possible. It also gets less frequent the more you shave those areas, don't wait for it to come back. Just go over it with a razor when you shower
I've been doing everything people are saying here and still getting them on my legs, to the point where it is making me question my commitment to IPL. (Except the hot water part because that's apparently debunked. Shower will have to do but can't hurt to try again I suppose.)

Really don't know what to do here? I have no razorburn, but break out when hair starts to grow.

Swimming in the ocean does seem to bring it down some. Otherwise I am focusing on trying to avoid irritation and sunburn. Is exfoliating a lot (during the week) something I should be doing?
Ok I have tried every single hair removal trick in the book, and have been epilating my body hair for the past few months and I can confidently say that epilating is the best thing that works for me so far. Since the hair doesn’t come back for multiple weeks, any additional redness or bumps was worth it. 
I then found an aftershave with glycol in it called “bump patrol” that eliminated ALL of my acne, redness, bumps, ingrown hairs and everything! All I had to do was apply it immediately after epilating and I never got any bad side effects! I’ve tried it on my arms, legs, and torso after epilating and all of those areas were perfectly clear the following days!
Highly recommend an aftershave with glycol in it, Google says the glycol helps with redness specifically.
Wish I could find the picture again but it basically goes over the proper method to shave.

1) Shower/Wash your body off with Warm water. Nothing thats too hot or you may risk frequent cuts.

2) Exfoliate your skin with a Loofah, scrub or anything else that is meant for exfoliating skin.

3) Lather up, cover the area you plan to shave with a shaving cream. Do not use shampoo or conditioner as a replacement.

4) Start shaving! Shave against the direction of the hair for the smoothest results. When it comes to sensitive areas just shave with the direction of the hair so those sensitive areas dont get irritated.

5) After you've fully shaved the areas you desired, once again take a shower and wash off first with warm water so that your pores may open and you can remove any possible residue from the shaving cream, then end the shower with cool/cold water to encourage your pores to close.

6) Moisturize! If you are prone to acne then use an oil free moisturizer. This can prevent itchiness and help your skin feel silky smooth!
COCONUT OIL!!!

Cannot say this enough, but I rub coconut oil all over my legs and pits especially after i shave and it keeps everything smooth
I have a few parts of my body that will also break out if I shave them. I will also break out there if the hairs get too long. I am currently just using a trimmer to keep it very short in those areas. The rest I can use a regular razor to cleanly shave. I am doing that until I can get hair removal done on those areas.
Pores can‘t shrink or open. Heat or cold can maybe soften or tighten things for a short period of time but nothing other than that
I used to use the trimmer attachment on my epilator (Braun Silk Epil 9) and it worked okay but it took me too long and it works better dry so by the time I'd finish I would be all sweaty and it would make it even harder. I may start using it again for certain areas like my thighs since my razor has a skinnier blade than the epilator and it still gets a decently close shave so it may speed things up
So she is okay with you suffering with razorbumps and razor burn but not a bit of leg hair? I don’t understand how people can lack that sort of empathy it just seems entirely illogical
My epilator has an attachment similar to that, although it has a single blade and one of the cylindrical parts rather than two
Yep! I’d say the same, also a hot/warm shower helps me
I might give that a try, my epilator has a trimmer attachment with a pretty wide blade and it may make the process easier as well since my thighs are what takes the longest usually. I usually shave in whatever direction is easiest to reach but generally that tends to be against the grain
I would do it if I wasn't still with my parents. I can get away with shaving (they make comments about it sometimes, they don't really like it but they also don't try to stop me) but there's no way they'd let me do anything permanent. Plus even with something like Groupon its still a few hundred dollars so it's quite expensive for me right now
I have an epilator but I couldn't handle the pain so I ended up just using it for the electric trimmer attachment before I got my safety razor
I'll have to give exfoliating and the cold water a try, the rest are things I already do when I shave. Thanks for the tips!!
That was certainly what I meant, I probably could have used more specific language though, you're right.
She says it embarrasses her, i usually wear pants so i dont have to shave though.
Yup, ""with"" is a bit tougher but worth it if less irritating. I started doing that with my face a while back and have way less razer burn.
I see. But still, the aftershave works no matter what shaving method you use, so I highly recommend you try it at least once? It worked well for me at least.

And may I ask what part of the body you tried it on first? Cause arms are the easiest for me, followed by legs. 
And after the very first time you epilate your hair, it gets SO MUCH easier. The hairs that grow next time are much thinner and were 90% less painful the second time.
Epilating underwater in the bath also is much less painful but a little slower.

This is true for *all* shaving methods by the way: hot water on your skin before shaving makes it much easier to remove hair. I find the hotter the water the better.
Hopefully it helps! I've just recently started doing this routine myself
Allow me to go against this recommendation but I had the same problem till I started using conditioner instead of shaving cream, I could find a link for exactly what I use (it’s cheap as hell don’t worry) but I think it has like oil in it that lubricates way better than conventional shaving cream. Also if your skin is damaged then ide let it heal back to atleast close to full health even if it means the hair gets long (I just wear jeans to get around this) [here found it ](https://www.walmart.com/ip/Suave-Professionals-Invigorating-Shampoo-Conditioner-Rosemary-Mint-Dry-Damaged-Hair-Paraben-Free-Dye-18-oz-2-Count/201079865)
But assuming your the minimum age to have Reddit which I think is 13 and your mom was the minimum age of consent that puts her at atleast 31 which should be old enough to stop caring about what people think of you and at that age she should have the maturity to realize that it’s not her body. But then again the older generations also have some interesting habits of trying to please strangers and will go to very strange lengths to make sure the stranger they walked past gets a good gander at their child’s legs and lord knows they have to be “presentable” for such an occasion. Idk nothing about it seems logical to me, if I had a daughter (because that’s the assumption she’s under) I wouldn’t exactly want people ogling over her legs especially if she is getting razor burns, ide take the comfort of my child over the opinions of strangers any day but that’s just me I guess. Stay safe, stay happy dude
My face tends to be okay regardless of which way I shave, it does make my acne flare up a bit (not nearly as bad as my body) but I don't usually get razor burn, especially not with the safety razor
I tried my pubic area as well as my tummy and legs (below the knee). Whenever I shave I do it while taking a hot shower and that's where I tried epilating as well.
Make sure to wet the skin then rub in the conditioner and then take a bit of water and rub it till it feels super slippery, idk the ratio but you get a feel for it

For what specific reasons do you not use it in public? If it's not a problem to answer this...

Anyway just my area isn’t very trans friendly sadly
Aaah then I'll tell you a secret...lol  
  
I think everyone has a hidden side that they don't show to others (I'm like that too)

I'm a cis woman and my girlfriend is trans...	"I'll tell you my story

I've been in a relationship with M for five months now. She recently completed 1 year since she started hormone treatment, and to make a long story short, we've been living together for 3 months, since I was kicked out of my house when my parents found out about my relationship.

Living with her has been an experience that has changed my vision of what it means to be a woman and of course, of what it is like to live with dysphoria in daily life.

From the beginning we were never a conventional couple. At first I was afraid to go out in the street holding hands, when we kissed in public, when she dressed more feminine or the simple looks of rejection and confusion of the people (In fact we always went out with a knife up our sleeve for safety reasons.) Being normal has never been an option, and I assumed it from the beginning.

From time to time I ask her questions about her transition, about her childhood and the changes she is noticing in her body. It's always interesting to listen to her, or well, at least for me. I admit that in spite of this there are times when I really forget that she is a trans woman, I think I have her so internalized as one that I even have dissonance when I see pictures of her past.

Anyway, I tell you this to put you in the context of the following fact:

&#x200B;

Today she, my sister and I went out. My sister is younger and innocently asked her: -What's the best thing about being trans? to which she drew a blank and said: -nothing-.

As you can imagine, the thought haunted her for a while and she started to get sad. I tried to console her, and the truth is that... I will never know what it is like to be a trans woman. 

I come to this community to get more insight on the subject, plus I don't know any other couple like us, we have no representation and no one to turn to for advice in these situations.

&#x200B;

How can I help  when dysphoria overwhelms her?"	"Well when my dysphoria overwhelms me it's sometimes hard for me to really listen to what others say because we are our own biggest critics and media is plagued with alot of negativity towards trans people especially the trans women so it's easy for us to be affected by those kinds of negative things if I was her I'd want pampered like a girl having my hair, nails, and makeup done make her feel as beauty and cute as possible make it hard for her to see her old self in the mirror I hope this helps you so you can help her😊
The best thing about being trans is just being authentically me everywhere.

My wife and I don’t need to carry weapons but are considering carrying pepper spray.  We got married and lived as a straight couple.  I get what you mean by the looks when you’re out there.  Cishet people are weird.
When I'm super dysphoric, just having somewhere to hold me or be with me while I cry, not trying to ""make me feel better"", just letting me cry and be sad... that all I need... sadly most of the time I have no one and just cry alone in my bed...

It is different for everyone, and possibly my way of dealing with it isn't that good... but that the only way I can calm down later...

After that I'm usually just exhausted and can really use some comforting (that I also almost never have)

Hope this can somehow help you!
I love being trans, it has brought so much happiness into my life. Sometimes it's hard. When I'm not around cis people and can just fully relax into myself, I'm finally able to breath. My girlfriend is also trans and there is a joy and connection we share together. Rather than dealing with 2x the dysphoria, we are each able to help the other and experience 2x the euphoria.
I treat my dysphoria like I treat my depression or anxiety and I try to change it's course, mentally. I try to focus on how it felt that first time I saw myself for the first time: Crying tears of joy in a Torrid changing room with my friend! Any time my dysphoria makes me doubt, or second guess, I remember the joy I felt, and it loses it's sting.
When dysphoria overwhelms it's like a thunderstorm rolling in off the water. Theres not a thing you can do to stop it, you have to embrace it. 

Dont try to fix things, dont try to lend a helping hand. Dont try to pull her up out of it. She must go through it and will come out stronger on the other side.

Just be there to help bail when the water gets to high.
Just be there. Try to distract her with something that makes her feel pretty. Dysphoria is tough, I'm struggling everyday and I'm finally 2 months on hrt after staying in my egg for 50 years. I feel better more at peace with myself but society and the biases of ignorant people sure don't help. She's lucky she has you. Hug her, tell her you love her, that means more than most realize, until they don't have it. Your a good person, you'll do the right thing.
Came here for advice because I’m in the same situation, I just want to support her. I wanted to thank OP for posting and the commenters for giving advice.

I wish there was more to be done. I value the advice here and I’ll try to suppress my desire to fix and deal with it separately from supporting her in her time of need. But the anger I feel towards people who trigger her and the world at large is so so big.
literally she is my barbie and i love it :3
This
You're right, that's good advice. <3

Sometimes I think that I am very invasive with a subject that, I feel, does not correspond to me.
no that's ayn rand nonsense
OMG really  
I'm glad you started treatment. This is just the beginning.
I wish I had a girlfriend that would do that to me but I have neither haha
From experience, having a single voice there to help keep you grounded is worth more than anything. 

Dont stress about being too invasive. All you need to do is pay attention. She will give you the cues as to when to press and when to back off. Mistakes will be made, but everything can be learned.
I would be careful taking this entirely to heart, as what works for one person may not work for others. It could even be worse if she is used to care and support from you, only to see that going away because you think her facing it on her own will help.

Personally while my partner can't swoop in and make all the dysphoria better, or even understand it all the time, she does so much by being there for me. Holding me while I cry, pointing out the positive changes when I'm being down on myself, showering me with affirmation even when I'm skipping along with joy. Its all helps.
Our experiences with it must be different. Maybe yours isnt so bad?
Another thing that may help her is if you surprise her with a bunch of flowers. Not for anything special, but just to show her how beautiful she is to you. Little things like that that aren’t always thought of because they are so simple and easy to do.
Maybe the right girl hasn't arrived yet...

Always remember...	"They grew up never questioning.
We grew up confused.
They never tried to be different.
We challenged our roles.
They can blend in.
We choose to stand out.
They get relative safety.
We live in danger.
They don't even get asked.
We have to explain why we exist.
They get ignored.
We are scrutinized constantly.

We've all made this choice.
To be who we truely are.
To not hide.
To walk the longer road.
To take the harder path.
It make us strong.
It makes us powerful.
We are amazing creatures.
We are gods and goddesses.
Be proud.
Be unafraid.
Be who you were meant to be.
And know that you're not alone."	"💖💖💖

Do I Pass? I’m in the closet and trying to understand myself again. Finding trying different outfits helpful. Wearing breasts forms and shapewear which makes me feel more comfortable in my own skin. Any advice would be great. Keeping face out of frame for safety reasons		"Yeah you seem to me to pass👍🏳️‍🌈

For the most part yes.  One thing I noticed is your breasts seem slightly more spaced and rounder than natural ones but I'm paid to look at bodies and it's not something everyone will notice."	bvlgk2	trans	38	0.95	2019-06-01 14:38:12
Confronted My Transphobic Dad -- CW(Mild Transphobia)	"Today I bought my first set of femme clothes, that I actually loved the look and colors of, and I even picked'em out myself in the store. For context, I'm 34, MtF (she/her), eleven months into my transition, ten days from three months on my hrt meds.

For a lil context... the last time I actually wore clothes I loved... I was like fifteen, maybe sixteen years old, and the insecure, hateful preacher I lived with at the time, humiliated me and made me feel so bad for just being authentic to me.

Back to this afternoon...

My dad says to me, ""Keep it in your private life."" -- Referring to me being authentic to who I am.

I said to him, stern in my reply, ""No, it's because of people saying things, just like that, that humanity, loses precious lives everyday. I refuse to live in secret because of your insecurities, lack of understanding and lack of empathy."" He shut up after I spoke those words to him.

One day I'll be 100% out to the entire world and I am so over playing pretend and putting on a face for the happiness of others... over choosing my own well being and happiness.

Trans lives matter just as much as cis lives. No less and no more. We are equal and we deserve to live and be happy just as much as any cis person. However, f*&k the hateful, ignorant people who refuse to just try and understand where another human being is coming from. I will live every day of my life, till I've got no life left to live, doing my best to raise awareness, help and stick up for my brothers, sisters and brethren found among the LGBTQ+ community. The very community that has encouraged me to be authentic to myself and try my best to be happy as myself.

Wish me luck everyone, but like it's been my goal now, for almost four months, that in two/three years time I'm a certified mental health peer counselor in my state. I can't ignore the hate I've experienced and lived through in my life... let alone the hate and hell wrought upon so many people just trying to simply live and be happy as themselves.

Peace, safety and love to you all!

You are so strong. I’m so happy for you. Show the world how you truly are.
I love this so much🌈🏳️‍⚧️🏳️‍🌈♥️🌻
Thx hun, I really appreciate the support. Peace, safety and love to you always!

--edited to add my intention--
Thx for the reply!
I don't think I could be this strong, or alive, without the awesome support my higher power blessed my life with and the welcoming and loving LGBTQ+ community that very same God blessed me to be accepted and supported by. I don't really have any real family, but, I personally, thank God I've got some friends who actually believed in me and had the courage to be like, ""Hey hun... plz try and heal yourself."" or ""There's not a dang thing wrong with just being yourself.""

One thing led to another, over the past few years, some shadow work and EMDR and some time later:

 True story, I just took my first long actual bath in like idk...  twenty-six years. 

Lavender Dr Teal's... candles, my fav incense, my favorite cottagecore soundtrack and my favorite book. I don't know if I've been this happy before... 😭 Like oh my gosh, I am so thankful to be alive and able to say I have decent health, electricity, food and shelter.

My hrt meds changed my entire existence from completely miserable, from my lowest point, the point I hung myself in my literal bedroom closet during the dark winter of 2018.

The only reason I am still alive right now... honest to God, my dad, same one this post is about, woke up from a nap and came into my room to see why I was so quiet. For a lil context, I have a trauma bonding kinda relationship with him and he'd had me in complete tears earlier that day.

Well, needless to say, he found me with our dog's leash wrapped around my neck on the verge of losing consciousness.

That was after what had happened to me on July 5th, 2018. From complications due to the flu and Diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA) I got to spend like my sixth or seventh time in a hospital bed, of my local ICU. 

Ever felt potassium chloride in your vein without enough saline pushing behind it? I have... spoiler alert... it feels like literal fire moving through your vein. Not fun... anyhoo...

I used to hate my life every single day. I still do sometimes, but goodness I look forward to being myself always and never hiding my face in fear again.

I've been through a lot and honestly, my God as my witness, I am thankful to be able to say my last HbA1c was 6.4 and not 14+ like it used to be. Pretty amazing what happens when a human being embraces themselves as they are and doesn't try to morph into the f'd-up social constructs forced upon everyone from pretty much birth till said person is able to experience their form of freedom from those societal constructs; societal constructs, mind you, that are used to destroy and dehumanize normal, everyday, human beings like you and I.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

I just wanna live long enough to see peace for everyone, not just some, privileged few. I literally have vowed, before my higher power, I will live the rest of my life never to harm another. It's not roses and daisies, but this is a life I've never had before More importantly, a life I chose myself and even a name I absolutely love and cherish, not one my abusers gave to me with zero thought of how I would feel later in life

My life today vs just two years ago is one filled with peace, happiness, belonging and fulfilment.

I will not repeat the hate shown to me. Nope, this girl isn't about the violence she was raised by. Lol 

Also, little secret about me, I despise the society around me that, I feel, basically worships violence and not caring about your neighbors and having excesses while others suffer from hunger and complete hopelessness. I cannot ignore those things... not after everything I've lived through and watched happen in my short life.

Thx for letting me share. I never dreamed in all my life that I'd be blessed with a community that would help me find courage and strength to heal and grow to be happy as myself.

Like I feel pretty blessed reading everyone's comments. This is just a lil of what I've lived through, but my gosh it's so relieving to be accepted by friends here and to know I actually do have a place of belonging now... like I used to feel so alone and like that it was me vs the hateful world...

I was wrong, big time wrong, it's my community and my friends and family, found in that community, who are fighting right along beside me and so many others to stop the hate and injustice brought down on so many who are completely undeserving of the hate. 🥰

Stay strong everyone! ✌️ 🏳️‍🌈"	py7fwh	trans	34	0.97	2021-09-29 23:32:04
PSA - invisible bra for summer!	"For all the girls on HRT that are starting to develop breasts but still need to hide them. Summer is hard, especially if you live somewhere warm and can't wear multiple layers. I found an excellent bra that hides puffy areolae / developing breasts under a t-shirt **without** **showing a bra strap at all**.

I hope this doesn't violate sub rules. I'm not advertising - just trying to help. **Mods** \- please let me know if there's a more appropriate way to go about this - I really just want to spread the word. I see this as a safety issue for some trans women (it is for me), and so I think it's worth sharing.

I bought this bra on Amazon and it has been a game changer for me. I hope it helps you out too!

I've had a hard time finding this style of bra strap, but it's comfy as heck and gets the job done.

**EDIT: I'm 165 lbs, 6' tall, and I ordered a medium. I'm pretty slender, and it's not too tight at all.**"	"I think you for this very useful advice 💖

[SERIOUS] Fellow Trans, how do you defend yourself? Do you consider yourself prepared if assaulted?	"Hate crimes seem to be on the rise. Our position as a very vulnerable minority is already tenuous. We all know the horrid statistics around being trans and getting bullied or even murdered... So how come self defense isn't a more prevalent topic? 

Therefore I ask you all: how do you plan on defending yourself? Have  you ever taken a self defense class? Do you own a weapon? Are you morally opposed to such things? 

I feel strongly in preparedness but not hysteria, which is why I put the serious tag up. I believe our future is survivable but dangerous, especially for those of us not willing or able to ""pass"". I'd like a conversation, if not a more regularly recurring conversation, on our safety."	"I conceal carry a pistol. Sorry not sorry
I did cross country and track in high school and still run a fair amount.

I am a firm believer in the ""flight"" side of fight or flight response
I live in a liberal town in the UK. That, more than anything is my self-defence technique.

I know a little self-defence from my youth, can keep one person away. But in any realistic scenario my self defence is a good pair of running shoes and a very fast sprint. I suggest others learn the same technique. 
I live in a tiny semi-liberal college bubble in the middle of a poor LA neighborhood. There was a 3 person shooting three blocks away two weeks ago, and a drive-by two blocks away a couple months ago. I've been called a fag out of car windows. One of my neighbors loudly complained about fags when my BF and I hugged in the pool. A few months ago someone slammed on our door in the middle of the night and pulled the screen off one of our windows.

I carry a Kershaw folding knife when out after dark. It's the maximum legal length for LA County. I don't have formal self defense training, but I was in a few fights in middle/high school and won most of them despite being fat and weak, by being ruthless and fighting dirty. I don't have excessive confidence in my fighting ability, but at the very least I should be able to make the person regret it.

I do own a WW2 rifle, but it isn't really suitable for home defense. I plan on selling it and buying a home defense shotgun -- Mossberg 500 with an LED flashlight and tritium sights, with the adapter to shoot Aguila mini buck shells.

I wish I could carry a gun. An LC380 or a Makarov would greatly improve my peace of mind. But the LA sheriff won't give anyone a concealed carry license unless they do him a ten thousand dollar favor, so...
I concealed carry a 9mm, I have karate, judo, and boxing experience that my broken back makes a one try option anymore, and I am hopefully going to get a concealed carry training license to offer classes to the local LGBT community here in a month or so.  
  
Also I'm not morally opposed to putting my life and safety above people going out of their way to damage me temporarily or permanently.
I am MtF and a former new roomate tried to rape me after days of harrassment. Unfortunately for him I am 6'2 and was quite athletic as a young male. Muscle memory and anger took over and I knocked the guy out with a single punch.

But I live in Canada, where any type of self-defense is a felony unless you have bold, factual proofs against the agressor. Contextual narratives, even when blatantly credible, will never make cases for sel-defense. So my agressor pressed charges against me and I got prosecuted. His bruised face seemed like a good enough evidence for sending me  to the judge. 

I suppose I should have let the agressor molest me before giving him the k.o.
Speaking just for myself, my parents kind of knew I was going to be bullied growing up. They enrolled me in Akido and Karate and made me take a few years of each. I hated every minute of because I was a stay at home videogame nerd. It wasn't long before I understood the value of such things tho... When I got to high school it wasn't a week into my freshman year before some senior bullies got interested in me. I defended myself and got left alone for the most part. 

I don't think martial arts are the sole cure to our safety issues but surely it couldn't hurt to build our confidence up. 

What other avenues should we explore?how can we promote a culture of preparedness?
I have 4 years of intensive martial arts training(2-3 hours a day 5-6 days a week) and I carry a collapsible baton in my purse. It's been some years now since I practiced but I've maintained at least enough muscle memory to give me an edge. I'm thinking of getting some mace too and just saving the baton as a plan b for especially windy days when mace might backfire. 
I'm ftm and currently living in a homeless shelter. Most of the other guys know, thankfully only a few have grumbled about it and I do have friends who have my back. But after Trump won the election I got scared, sure most don't seem to care, but I sure as hell don't want to be cornered by the ones that do.

My boyfriend (also homeless but employed and working on getting out) offered to buy me a knife, but as luck would have it, this morning while everyone was packing up and leaving (they kick us out for two hours to clean) I saw a folding knife just sitting on the floor so I grabbed it. I did read up on knife and self defense law in my city and state so I'm good there.

I haven't had any recent training but I will be practicing with it. We're supposed to check our weapons when we come in but I know several people that don't and they're really less than thorough in searching us for contraband. I know I risk being kicked out for a few days or so but I sure as fuck don't want to be raped and/or murdered.
I did mma for a while. And muay thai. I'll kick the shit out of anybody dumb enough to assault me unarmed. If they are armed well then I'll.......probably cry
I conceal carry a pistol and use a sword cane

I took self defense classes YEARS ago but I'm kinda rusty. I wear steel toed boots a lot of the time, so a quick kick to the shins or testicles ought to provide enough distraction for me to run away. I'm in super good shape because of the physicality of my job, so honestly I mostly plan on running away if necessary. I feel like staying in top shape is always a good plan. When all else fails, I'm friends with two trans women who own more than enough weapons.

Also, and I know this isn't a popular idea: do NOT wear headphones in public. Be aware of your surroundings as much as possible, including actively listening at all times. I know that headphones give us an excuse not to speak to people, but if you're concerned for your safety, you'll have to deal with public interaction some other way. 

Edit: for anyone thinking about arming themselves, train yourself first. Weapons can easily be used against you if you don't know what you're doing. Basic knife and gun defense moves are good to learn in the event that your assailant disarms you and threatens you with your own weapon.
I Live in Canada. Defending yourself is almost a crime up here...

My only weapon are my fists.
I own a business and I'm trans so I carry a 9mm pistol, a decently sized knife, and a bright flashlight. I also live in a bad area, just last night there was a drive by shooting down the street. The knife and flashlight have great everyday uses at work for opening boxes or seeing things in dimly lit areas but their primary use is for defense. Of course it's never good to carry such a load out and expect trouble or you could end up causing trouble. The best thing for defense is to avoid places or situations that could be problematic.
My first response is to disengage from an altercation, so I've been working out to increase my stamina and endurance. If that fails, I carry either a 9mm (in the city) or a .45 (in the woods). 

I have no moral reservations about killing someone if my life is well and truly on the line. That is a choice you need to make WAY before you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife. 
i have two knives
I have a knife, mace, and some martial arts knowledge, and I'm going to swing by a dojo I think I want to start attending today.
Krav maga
Defending myself through physical violence was my way back when i identified as a male. Now i use charm and seduction, assuming all they want is to use my body for some quick fun. If they're after my money or life, i might risk breaking a nail to punch em in the face.
I plan on escalating the situation and getting myself killed in a plausible not-my-fault scenario.
I have mace, a knife & I usually just fight. I haven't started moning yet so it's rough sometimes. 
I carry a super-bright tactical flashlight and a pepper spray.
Hell yes. Train with that thing..
This is exactly why I became a stealth runner.  When I needed to run, it was my superpower.  No need to fight back or even block when I could just run.  I was the fastest runner in school, but never competed.  When I was depressed, I could pass everyone on the track.  But the locker room was still my worst nightmare waking up each morning and the single reason why I dreaded going to school.  I did take martial arts and learned how to use lower body strength in defense.  Never had to use it that way fortunately.
I've said for years that the best martial art for self defense is track. It's usually not what people want to hear when they ask that, though -_-
I totally agree, I also invested in a rape alarm and some defence spray. The alarm is more important IMO
Sorry to hear about your neighbors and the harassment in your local community. That's so disappointing. I sympathize with your statement on confidence in fighting back: do you have any plans on yelling a self defense course? How do fellow Trans deal with their own experiences where you are? Do you belong to any local groups in your area where this topic could come up?
> I live in a tiny semi-liberal college bubble in the middle of a poor LA neighborhood. 

Do you go to USC? We want our bell back.
I would recommend against a shotgun for home defense, they can honestly just make a serious mess of your home and injure people you didn't intend to injure. A pistol is more practical. 

[deleted]
> sword cane.  
  
Sploosh. So awesome!
Check the YouTube channel ""Active Self Protection"" 
What's a stealth runner?
I've considered a pistol, I like them and really want a 1911 (specifically the S&W EMP 9mm), but I'm a crap shot with them. And I'm worried about being disarmed. I've always been more of a rifle/shotgun gal, my ideal home defense gun would be an SBR 9mm carbine. But tough luck owning something like that in California. So shotgun is a good compromise for me. Especially with low recoil ammo like Aguila Mini Shells.
I ordered one online, but a friend who already had one traded me for his since he said mine looked a bit flimsy. I think he bought his at a gun show or something like that. I can't remember the site I ordered mine off of. 
http://i.imgur.com/Y2WJpIi.gif
I have to use a cane, so I got a sword cane for self defence.
It's pretty cool.
Shotgun is actually great. Lead spheres don't tend to penetrate things as much as pointed copper, and the spread isn't like a video game. Maybe the size of a splayed hand at twenty feet. Serious kinetic energy. You won't hurt people to the sides of you, it's a great choice. 
This is a bot I can get behind.  
  
Phrasing! bot incoming?
This is always what I was told. 

If you live in the middle of nowhere and have long hallways, a handgun or rifle is acceptable; however, if you're worried about hitting your neighbor because your rifle bullet went straight through your wall, you should likely be using a shotgun. Much easier to hit a target with a shotgun and minimal training, than it is with a pistol. "	5dapbd	trans	30	0.9	2016-11-16 18:10:51
Crazy Cis People Who Think They're Allies	"Im a traveler. When I arrived in this city I was invited by another traveler Id met prior to come visit, someone cis who considers themselves an ally.

I drove out to the suburbs and found this person staying with some nontravelling people. These ""normal"" folks are quite nice. They gender me correctly and dont bring up being trans. Theyve never even met someone they knew was trans. My traveler contact, lets call her ""Jane"", was a different story though.

Immediately upon arrival Jane asks me ""when did you change?"" And then, when I tell her thats a rude question, goes on to explain that she thinks her child might be trans. So, I opened up a bit to her out of duty to the child, thinking nothing of it.

That night we all went out on the town and i ran into some jerk that wanted to fight me for ""being a faggot"". Jane starts a Facebook conversation about the incident without my knowledge, proclaiming her duty to trans people, etc. This post did nothing to help me, the trans person she supposedly ""supports"". It actually just further decreased my safety by publicizing my transsexualism. But whatever, her heart is in the right place... Right?

Today I was showing the ""normal"" folks daughter, Amy, and Janes kid (who Jane suspects is trans) how to sew something. Janes kid keeps calling me ""he"". Amy and I keep correcting them. Finally, feeling guilty, this poor child of Jane's (the child Jane suspects is trans!) gives a completely unessecary apology:

""Sorry. My mom only calls her ""he"". So I thought that was right.""

Sometimes the less people know, the more respectful they are. They have no experience with trans peole so they take your word for it and let you lead.

Sometimes people who have done a little bit of research get to have a bias about it. They haven't done enough to be an expert but just enough to be a dangerous asshole.
On the bright side, there is hope for the kid and it sounds like you've made allies of the ""normal"" folks.
People like that aren't supportive for us, they're supportive for themselves. It's nothing but a means to feel good about themselves without having to actually earn it. People always find ways to cut corners when it comes to reaching a desired sense of self. They have to believe that they are progressive and aware because it makes them feel like they are doing their part as decent human beings. But their focal point is so centralized around their own ego that they can't see far enough past it to realize when they're lying to themselves.  
  
They choose to blind themselves to what they don't want to be true rather than making what they do want to be true into a reality, because trying comes with the potential for failure and their desire to be seen as one of the majority of ""good people"" itself stems from a sort of cowardice. Because in truth most people aren't ""good"", they're only neutral, and as a neutral majority they sway whichever way most people do(or at least what most  attempt to emulate) and that path, to them, becomes defined as ""good"".  
  
It's basically a form of saving face in light of an existential dread that most are too afraid to face, and far more people are guilty of that than people seem to be aware of because the same sort of self deception applies to that fact as well. Life is unfair, indifferent and selfish, and deep down we all know that it doesn't have to be that way, yet the only thing that puts us in this position to begin with is a, ""if we can't beat them, join them"", sort of mentality. People love to complain about the current human condition as if they're above it, yet they never actually remove themselves from that torrent of destructive psychology because nobody wants to feel alienated, so they just flat out deny their part in it instead.  
  
That's *most* people, and that's why most self proclaimed allies will only disappoint. Progressive movements attract these parasites of well intentioned causes like flies to honey and there are far more of them than there are people who are actually willing to face reality with all of its harsh judgment and potentual for failure. A condition that they themselves caused by attempting to break the curve of ethical decision making by cutting corners to meet the status quo. As a species whose evolutionary tendency is towards a sense of community, fear of being an outcast is one of our strongest motivators. So it's no surprise that this sort of thing happens within a neutral majority who claims that they know what it is to be ""good"". 
This sounds like the same kind of person who commits acts of ""selflessness"" and then quickly posts photographic evidence to social media.  Being nice to those ""transgenders"" is really just food for the ego.  

I'm really sorry you had this experience, it sounds pretty awful.
While I am with you in this sentiment, I ouch a bit at the use of the word ""crazy.""
I love you.
Personally I'm a huge fan of the ones that tell you they are ""all for transgender rights"" and then immediately go on to talk about bathroom segregation, as if forcing people into the wrong bathroom ""protects everyone.""

Might as well say ""I'm all for black rights, which is why I think they should have their own toilets""
More than that. The 12 year old has no idea. Or at least she didn't last time I checked. This situation actually most reveals the falsity of this ""ally"" because theres no relying on her not to out me; in fact, its just more likely. 

And this has brought me to a crossroads. For, when I began transition I lost many people and now Ive come to a point in my physical transformation that I stand to experience that again! In the form of being read!  So it seems to me I need to step into a life that minimizes my relationship with these types. I dont need any extra variables or liabilities.

What's more, I've never experienced the world without these ""allies"" and it strains my sanity. Am I passing? Has my therapy been effective? Who knows?!
I just assume everyone, even so-called allies, has some form of cis privilege, until proven otherwise.

Texas Creates Chilling Trans Registry, similar to the Nazi process of identifying Jews.	"https://jezebel.com/texas-creates-chilling-registry-of-16-000-people-who-ch-1849898809

""Earlier this year, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton’s (R) office requested the state Department of Public Safety to compile a list of transgender residents in the state, a DPS official confirmed to the Washington Post in a Wednesday report. A spokesperson for DPS told the Post that Paxton’s office made “a verbal request” calling for the total number of Texans who had changed the gender on their driver’s licenses or in other government records within the past two years.""

This is fucking wild. Putting registries of trans people together with public records. let me say this loud so the hateful bigots can here it. 
THIS IS WHAT THE NAZIS DID TO IDENTIFY AND ROUND UP THE JEWS. 

""German officials identified Jews residing in Germany through the normal records created by a modern state. They used census records, tax returns, synagogue membership lists, parish records (for converted Jews), routine but mandatory police registration forms, the questioning of relatives, and from information provided by neighbors and municipal officials.""

https://aboutholocaust.org/en/facts/how-did-the-germans-know-who-was-jewish"	"I don't want to downplay what's going (it's obviously worrying), but the Jezebel article is extremely misleading. Texas did not create a registry of trans; someone from the legislature asked for a list and was told it didn't exist.

Keep fighting for our rights, but don't fall into panic-mode either.
You can't look into someone's head, you can only judge the content of someone's character through their actions. Texas politicians are acting like Nazis because they are Nazis. They may wave a different flag (although, they may wave the same flag as before somehow), but they hold every ideal and spout every value that was held by the white supremist regime of old. At least post-war Germany had a reason to turn to fascism in the wake of their crushing defeat, though. They were angry at the sudden changes, the reparations and the humiliation. That made them vulnerable to being manipulated, pacified just long enough to do nothing while horror rolled in and took over.

What does this new Confederate Reich have to fear? Unparalleled prosperity and safety? Political opposition that's committed to improving their lives? What they fear is imaginary boogeymen fed to them by mass media by their own representatives. And, now, their representatives are pulled from the same society, fighting ghosts that they themselves created! And they will try to round us up. Then our families and friends, then anyone we've come into contact with, then anyone they've come into contact with, and so on until they turn on themselves. It's not a long road back to feudalism and brutality, and it never will be.

Don't forget that they're already kidnapping immigrants, caging children, openly falsifying paperwork, defying and corrupting the judiciary. And not once do they suffer anything but a slap on the wrist. The American justice system at it's current best, can't even properly freeze a single buffoon that openly started a coup attempt and stole top secret documents. It's not that the Confederate Reich will secede, it's that they already did years ago, but somehow, they're allowed to occasionally control the Union's government and fuck up their shit for a few years.

Get mad! Let people know that there isn't a hint of hyperbole when you say that the GOP is the Nazi choice. It **IS** the Nazi party! And even if you didn't give a shit for anyone else but yourself, don't forget that no one suffered more under Nazi oppression than the Germans. It's almost exactly 100 years since the Third Reich started brewing, and the ideas and mistakes responsible are coming back into fashion. I refuse to believe that a ragtag band of misfits like us are the only people that are willing to stand up to that. The community stands against fascism. We don't have a choice, it stands against us. Let people know that fascism stands against them, too!
Is there a way to hide posts with the “possible trigger” tag? otherwise idk what the purpose of it is, especially when the trigger is in the title
I live in Texas. I'm terrified. Trying to move asap.
Wait you have a mode besides panic mode?
There has been so much reporting about this in the last 3-4 days, and not all has the whole story.  Yes, they have created a list.  They have a list of over over 16,000 individuals who changed their gender on their drivers licenses over the last 2 years.
Sorry if I upset you, my goal was obviously not to trigger people, just to point out the glaring similarities between the GOP's current actions and The Germans in WW2. It's a slippery slope that needs to be talked about.

Tips on surviving Texas	So I'm in the process of transitioning to female (I'm solidly in the She/They demigirl camp). I'm planning on moving from Connecticut to texas in august of this year to live with my girlfriend. It's only for two years at the absolute maximum because she hates the state as much as any person with a soul does, she just needs to finish college. I'm not very far into my transition and still am okay with presenting as male, although it is far from ideal. I'm about to start hormones, though. What should I do to balance both my transition and my safety?	"Be yourself, but I'd avail yourself of Texas's SECOND passion behind being bigoted and backwards, just in case. Better safe than sorry.
What part of Texas? I’m FTM from Texas and left about three years ago. People weren’t great but they were rarely directly aggressive or unpleasant. I just would avoid going to public restrooms or any gendered spaces, and keep out of straight bars. Otherwise you’re probably fine.
Whereabout in Texas? Cities are waaaaay different than rural towns with this kind of thing. 

Especially if you're going somewhere rural, look into options for getting prescriptions near where you're planning on going, and definitely see if there's a waitlist. Telekind, which covers the entire state as it's entirely virtual, currently has a 3-6 month wait list even if you're just transferring care to them. Planned Parenthoods in cities tend to get booked as soon as the monthly schedule comes out. If you're going to Dallas, I know a smaller clinic with a shorter waitlist if you want to dm me. 

You'll want to do research into the more accepting areas where you're going. There are some places I will not go in boy mode (ftm) for fear of getting hate crimed. A lot of times, even accepting areas have people who clearly want to say something once they realize you're not cis, so it becomes a matter of learning to recognize those people. 

Generally as long as you stick to urban areas, you'll be relatively safe. Then it's a matter of finding support and a good pharmacy. Chain pharmacies are usually better about this, from what I've heard, as long as you avoid walmart pharmacies. 

I wish you good luck in your transition and journey here! I promise we're not all as awful as the news makes you think! (though sometimes I'm unconvinced by my own promise... heck greg abbott)
My tip is don’t move to Texas /j kinda. I lived in Texas for 3 months and they were all about sports and completely against Gay
That was the plan! It's actually one of the things I'm looking forward to when moving.
San Marcos. I also don't want to get murdered in a gay bar either. How safe are gay bars.
San Marcos, which apparently is one of the most LGBTQ friendly places in the state.
San Marcos is a cute little college town where a lot of student-age people live, so it's a lot better than other places. If you can, come up to downtown Austin, since we've got a pretty solid queer nightlife scene!
Austin is just 30 minute drive away and its very LGBTQ friendly as well. I live in Austin now and it feels pretty safe to me. Theres plenty of inclusive bars and stuff and I’ve never felt not included in a clothing store even tho im pre everything as well and pretty much boymoding

Pro tip: you gotta float down the san marcos river in the summer 👌🏻
Oh yeah San Marcos is fine. You’ll go out in Austin, I would presume/recommend, although grabbing a beer inSan Marcos should be just fine. I reallllllly hope you have a car. It’s generally a decent area, although it’s just been a glorified gas-station and coffee stop for me, driving between SA/Austin/Houston/Bastrop… San Marcos is sleepy and a little dull, but alright. It’s largely a commuter/bedroom community for Austin and San Antonio. So, more family focused than the nearby cities.  

SAFETY: I’m from a progressive NW city, so TX has taken a bit to get used to. I try to explain to people there’s more toxic and dangerous masculinity in rural Washington/Oregon than Texas, but no one wants to believe me. They hear “Texas” and they assume it’s socially primitive with toothless cowboys in boots and spurs. Granted, toxic masculinity is a bit more visible here, but it’s more tame; less gun-rack-Proud-Boys shit that you see in rural NW. Austin and San Antonio are incredibly vibrant, successful cities. MY WORST SAFETY STORY: A Marlboro Light woman in Galveston recently told me she was gonna kick my ass, after I asked her nicely to please stop her children from throwing buckets of sand on a grounded seagull. This was two days before the dolphin incident that made national news. So, yeah, Big, Huge, weord state.

The Governor sucks but you know that. Lots of scared religious people afraid of change. Lots of weird small towns. But also lots of progressives, especially in Austin. All the big cities vote Blue if that tells you anything. Other than that, the state runs fairly well, although there are counties without a single doctor, rampant obesity and terrible proclivities for barbecued meat. And, not surprising, a HUGE rub between liberal cities and bumf%ck rural. 

Austin is a major Tech manufacturing and research Hub and is full of coastal transplants, in addition to its pre-existing eclectic/arts community vibe. Like, it’s still got strong willie Nelson music vibes, ancient roadhouse taverns, SXSW, etc, etc. Move there if you can or at least get up there and enjoy one of America’s best cities
Yeah San Marcos should be good, it’s about a 45 minute drive from me but the Austin area should be nice to you as well. It’s a bit of a college town so just be aware what comes with typical frat/college town stuff. 

Italian Garden, Fuego tortilla taco’s are fantastic and 24/7 and 54 Street were all some of my favorite places to eat there. As a side note my car was accidentally stolen by a friend one day and the cops found it about 4 minutes after getting all of my information so good response time there I’d say, my friend was a little confused though, lol.
oooh, it sounds like a fun place
Does it have a metal scene, that's the last thing I need to know XD
Wait, I need to know, how does a car get accidentally stolen
For sure. But Definitely indie and hipster country are its most famous genres. 
Hmm… I wouldn’t be surprised if the SA metal scene was better, though, cause rents are much lower for bands and Austin is a tad too hipster. But I’m not sure
I was staying at my then girlfriends place, her roommates friend was supposed to take her room mates keys to go to work but took mine. Me and her room mate had very similar color and looking cars,  we just heard the door close, no one else was home so we were like that’s weird, looked out the window and saw my car door close, ran outside and saw my car pulling away."	u62xw8	trans	27	0.91	2022-04-18 02:50:07
I don't want this	"I'm struggling pretty hard right now with stress. Egg recently cracked and I realized across my entire life I've had little moments where I should have recognized I wanted to be a girl, but instead I had the whole list of excuses you've all heard a hundred times by now and I'd just go play video games until it was out of my mind.

Now I've been forced to actually confront it and recognize that I want to be a girl, and I think I'd be happier as a girl, but I'm terrified of it all. I don't want to be trans. I wish I could just be happy as a boy and not feel gender envy. I don't want to risk transitioning just to discover E didn't do much for me so I will never pass. My life was so much easier before the egg cracked; even if I was lying to myself there was a certain safety in the lie that was comforting. I thought I knew who I was back then, but now nothing is certain and I'm so afraid. I wish I could go back to denial.

I don't know what to do. Everyone here seems so confident and proud of their identity and excited for the path forward; I don't know how you got that way. I mean I'm happy for you all, I just can't seem to figure out how to feel that way myself.

Sorry for the rant, I just...I'm hoping someone has something that'll magically make things make sense and I'll feel better. Not expecting really, just hoping."	"Hun, I'm so sorry you're going through this. Yes, a lot of us have been there. Do you really think life is going to be easier living a lie? Really think about that question.

In my teens, I wondered sometimes if being a straight male and acting like one would've made life easier. Probably would have in some ways, but I would hate myself and probably hurt myself because I would be living a lie. Not everything in life is going to be an easy choice, and being true to yourself is sometimes hard. The important thing to remember is that your happiness with who you are is what's most important. I hope that helps, hun. Let me know if you ever want to chat. ❤❤❤
The exciting part isn’t knowing what’s ahead of you but knowing you are a fully self-actualized human being.  Transition leaves you vulnerable.  It’s terrifying at times but it’s a great adventure in growth and reaching your potential.

It’s a process too.  My first year of transition was one of the most emotionally turbulent times in my entire life.  I’m at two years now going onto three and the nature of the challenges have changed but are still present.  I am still evolving; still growing.
I think that many - if not most - trans individuals are hesitant, lack confidence, and/or afraid when confronting the possibility that they may be trans, when wondering whether or not to transition, and even during transition. That's pretty normal, because the decision to transition is huge, and will change the rest of your life in a very fundamental way.

The confidence you see in others can come about in various ways. Some people have it because, either by luck or by design, they are surrounded by supportive individuals who understand and encourage them on their journey. Some people don't have that. Sometimes it takes years to build up that sort of confidence, and if you choose to transition and get the results you want, that can go a very, very long way to boosting not only your confidence but your entire outlook on life.

You mention being afraid of transitioning only to find yourself dissatisfied with the results and failing to pass. I think that it's fair to be worried about that, as unfortunately failing to go stealth has the potential to make everyday life more difficult, depending on your particular environment and circumstances. But you seem to be focusing exclusively on the most negative outcome possible. It also has the potential to make your life better in ways that can be hard to imagine until you've actually experienced them.

To draw on personal experience, I remember having periods of intense doubt both pre-transition and well into my transition. However, I knew that I was unhappy playing the role of a male, and that wasn't going to go away until I did something about it. So I started transitioning, and even in the years I waited to actually come out to anyone, my life was already greatly improved. Just by being able to be myself, even if it was just me alone in my own home. I was happier, and I loved myself a whole lot more, even if no one else knew.

This may not be the magic answer you're hoping for, but hopefully it can give you a little bit of what you're looking for :)
If you're able to, find a counselor or therapist who knows about gender identity. 

It's incredibly helpful, they will hopefully be able to help you figure out how to understand, accept, and be happy with your identity.
Hello. I'm feeling and experiencing the exact same thing right now. 

I know the feeling of what It was like being in denial or just putting thoughts to the back of your mind, while you go play video games. Keeping everyone else happy and having that safer comfort of not being different. 

I compare it an obedient dog that's only had life in cage, except it doesn't know its in a cage. It doesn't even want to leave the cage. Its the only life its known, everything fears the unknown.   

My life was easier for sure but it wasn't fulfilling or really all that great. Now at least I see a way out of existence I was living. Sometimes adopting a fuck it I will do what I damn well please attitude helps for me or just having some self acceptance ever now and then goes a long way as well.
One of my fears with transitioning is that, while I definitely feel I'd prefer being female to being male, if I try to transition and can't pass, I'd probably hate that more than either. Which naturally makes me wonder if it's worth the risk to even try, because I might get 10 years and 50k into transitioning just to realize I'll never actually be seen as female.
I have actually been seeing someone, per some pushing from my girlfriend, and while it has definitely helped in understanding I can't seem to get the whole accepting and being happy part. The state I'm in right now would be better described as, ""Upset and scared by the understanding, which makes me want to fight it or hide it more than accept it."" 

I'd been crossdressing for a while just because I liked the way it felt, and now when I look at the clothes I have I'm almost disgusted by myself because I can't see it as just goofing off and being weird anymore. I hope that doesn't come off as transphobic because I don't mean to say in any way that I'm disgusted by trans people. I'm just trying to say that now, the feelings I get from wearing them feel....wrong somehow. Like I'm not SUPPOSED to like wearing girl's clothes. And while before it was just weird fun, now it's like a reminder that I'm not who I want to be and I feel like I shouldn't even want to be that in the first place.
I’m no expert, and I’m also struggling with my own identity. I’m also experiencing a lot of fear, and something close to the disgust you describe. 
I’ve had to face up to some internalized transphobia, and learning to understand transphobia a little better has helped a lot. 
It’s not your fault if you have some internalized transphobia. Society teaches you to be transphobic. But you can try to understand it better, and work to overcome it, which is a good thing regardless of your one experience with gender. 
I would say that if you feel ‘disgust’ based on your own gender expression, it might be related to some transphobia. Just a thought.
Damn that’s Soo me right now, it’s a bit scary!
Also a bit reassuring that I’m not the only one:)"	murt8h	trans	26	1.0	2021-04-20 14:39:55

Dysphoria, and AI? I was just wondering if anyone else uses apps like FaceApp to help combat your gender dysphoria? I can’t come out for my own safety. 😢 So I do what I can to feel like my true self. (Also the names Dakota 🥺😘)		"FaceApp makes it worse for me. Just makes my hair longer to remind me that my face still looks male.
100% Have done this very thing. I got such major euphoria hits when the FaceApp algorithm started to actually gender me correctly last year.
That app misgenders me half of the time, and since I have long hair, it literally does nothing...
Well, yeah I get that completely and usually after I take the pic and look back later I do. I make it work I guess 😅

"Russian LGBT activist Elena Grigoryeva stabbed to death after her name appeared on the list of a ""gayhunter"" group Saw. Gets officially framed as ""domestic murder"", victim slandered and blamed. Authorities lie, refuse to acknowledge the political motivation and do nothing. LGBT people are in danger"	"[News article in English](https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/russian-lgbtq-activist-killed-after-being-listed-saw-inspired-site-n1032841)

>According to friends' and colleagues' online posts, Grigoryeva was worried about her safety after she found her name and personal information listed on the snuff site.  
>  
>“I learned today that Lena asked a mutual friend to take care of her cat in the event of her death when she was threatened with murder,” [friend and fellow activist Dinar Idrisov wrote on Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/DinarSpbRu/posts/1425612460923295).  
>  
>“The state of Russia was obliged to guarantee her the right to life,” Idrisov wrote. **“Lena and her lawyer appealed to law enforcement agencies both on the fact of violence and on the fact of threats, but there was no noticeable reaction.”**  
>  
>On Tuesday, Idrisov updated his post to note that Grigoryeva's mother had identified her body and that investigators in St. Petersburg had taken over the case. Other activists said on social media that Grigoryeva's body was found near her home over the weekend with stab wounds and signs of strangulation, The Moscow Times reported.  
>  
>On July 18, just **days before she was killed, Grigoryeva** [**posted an alert on her Facebook page**](https://www.facebook.com/lgbtnet/photos/a.178639678924393/2295138960607777/?type=3&theater) **about the “Saw” website.**  
>  
>Grioryeva wrote that the site, which organizes a “hunt for homosexual, bisexual and transgender people,” went online in spring 2018 and was shut down several times but always popped back up. **The website posted the personal data of “presumably LGBT+” activists, “including photos and addresses,” and offered prizes to those who completed an attack.**  
>  
>**“Law enforcement agencies have still not done anything to find the creators of this ‘game’ and bring them to justice,”** Grigoryeva wrote. She called on those opposed to the website to contact the Russian prosecutor’s office and the FSB, Russia’s intelligence agency.  
>  
>“IMPORTANT!” Grigoryeva wrote. “The Russian LGBT network has repeatedly tried to find people affected by the actions of this group, but failed. We did not find a single attack case directly related to this group.”  
>  
>**Three days after her post, Grigoryeva was dead.**

And finally,

>**Police in St. Petersburg confirmed she had reported being threatened repeatedly, but said the threats had not seemed a risk to her life and were related to domestic conflicts** with people she knew, the RBC media portal reported

But *there's actually more*. An [article from the official Russian investigative committee site](https://sledcom.ru/news/item/1376526/) (Russian) also says that

>...a previously convicted man from the Kyrgyz Republic,  born 1981, was detained---  
>  
>She lead antisocial lifestyle and often got drunk, sometimes in the company of the suspect

That's **Russian victim blaming classics**. Tell how bad and antisocial the victim was to imply that she *deserved* it and that her death is not significant anyway. Blame a foreigner who already was a criminal. A scum killed a scum during an argument, nothing to see here folks. And a big fat lie. A *social activis*t lead an *anti-social lifestyle*? Was repeatedly getting drunk with sketchy types? And he *just happened* to kill her right after her name appeared on an anti-gay website and she knew they were after her? It is not certain whether the suspect was a member of Saw (or just not said) but there are too many coincidences.

&#x200B;

**LGBT people are forced to leave the country.** They receive death threats and threats that their loved ones will be killed. [Here are screenshots](https://imgur.com/a/qmDQwll)  (Russian) of the threats Artyom Shitukhin, who is also on the list, received, and his story about how they tried to burn his house.

In short, after the attempt he ran to Netherlands and they told him to pay for his friend's ticket too or he'll be dead in a few days.

&#x200B;

**Tomorrow we may wake up to another victim.** Spread the word. How many people must die so Russian authorities acknowledge the problem? The world can't let it continue, can't let Russian LGBT people live in fear and wonder whether it's their last day alive. We need collective action to stop the gay hunting.

Am I over-privileged or spoilt for wanting to be trans?	"I have a lot of deep regrets and resentments towards myself for acting on this so late (I'm 20... already past puberty) and towards my parents for ignoring my cries for help in this area when I was young. But... whenever I catch myself feeling any dysphoria I keep thinking about how growing up in a first world country with all these prospects and safety nets and the generally high probability of leading a happy/safe lifestyle and how I should just shut up and enjoy my life. I feel so guilty... 

Furthermore my mother keeps talking about ""how I'm lucky I have such a nice body and I'm so handsome and I have no disabilities"" and how I'm doing something ""unnecessary"" that's ""voluntarily putting me in danger for no reason"" (father's out of the picture atm). I ""know"" I deserve to feel dysphoric but... I guess I need to hear someone else say it."	"Sometimes parents like your mother use guilt to try and protect you. Because all they should want is for you to be happy and healthy. My mom had concerns about me, but it's my choice what I do with my body.

As for privilege, those in the world that struggle to survive, like finding food and shelter will need to take care of those things first. But once they have those, these needs still come up. I know, I used to struggle.

I grew up with little, and the entire culture of fashion and clothing was seen as unnecessary extravagance by my parents. So wanting to express my gender in a typical way was against my family's moral code, even if I was born a girl.

I tried for years to ""just be happy with what I got"" like I'm sure your mom wants you to do. I was miserable, depressed, just an emotional mess. Finally, my parents wanted me to be happy more than anything else, and could accept that meant coming to terms with me being trans and wanting to change my body. Unfortunately, in my case, that was many wasted years in the process.

If I could travel back in time, I would have followed my heart, and not let my parents doubt get in the way of my happiness. I hope you find the right path for yours.

I think seeing first world vs the alternative as a positive/negative comparison is mostly a first world habit. Really there are pros and cons to each. First world countries have much higher rates of suicide and mental health issues due to the negative affects of social pressures and many who visit places like the US from poorer countries will say how put off they are by our lack of community and un-neighborly behaviors. We might have a wealth of resources which other places lack, but someone from some isolated tribe in a third world country would likely be amazed by how little emotional support we're offered from family or friends. 
You're trans now. There is no want. Transitioning is somewhere between a want and a need for most of us. You should make that decision based on what will make you happy long term, not based on pleasing your family. 
Go for it. I realized at 24 and started HRT at 25 and I have zero regrets. I have a few more hurdles in front of me than I initially expected, but my life is so much better now and so much more full of love. Be the best you that you can be and you'll have no regrets.
I started just days before my 24th birthday. I felt the exact same way. But I'm one of the younger people I've actually met. 

Yeah, I wish I had been like Jazz Jennings and demanded my gender when I was little. I wish I had been more vocal about it. I wish I didn't have to worry about vocal training (although, I've been able to get a good regime down, I now have a high pitched, natural sounding voice than some of my cis friends), or facial hair (thankfully I've never grown much, hormones helped a lot, and so has laser).

I struggled in a similar fashion to you. My boss ended up pushing me out of the closet by accident (bit if a story there), and he's gay and very supportive. Ignorant as fuck sometimes, but well intentioned and supportive. I'll take it.
You shouldn't feel guilty for being trans. There's a huge difference between wanting to be and actually being. You are trans, my friend. You're no fake; you experience dysphoria, you've struggled at the hands of it, and you're prepared to move forward. 

That being said, there's not a single thing wrong with you. When your parents say that you're throwing what you have away, just know that it's not true. That nice body will carry on being nice, that attractive face will continue being attractive, and your health has no need to suffer either. 

Live your life, find peace with your body, and I hope happiness comes your way.
Thank you for this. I didn't expect to hear from someone who grew up in unfortunate circumstances, so again, thank you. You didn't have to go out of your way. Maybe she isn't prepared to hear the truth about me, I'm beginning to feel. I think it's best I just start off on my own for now. I can't wait any longer, for the first time in my life the dysphoria is beginning to hurt (brought on by the feeling of inevitability at having passed puberty). I don't think I could take that getting any worse... 

That said, I hope things go as best as possible for you. I'm happy your parents finally understood, that must have been a huge relief! Oh, and I hope you now have the means to take good care yourself and your loved ones! 
Thank you for that first part. It's like the first thing everyone says (even if they're trying to be nice) ""oh, aren't you a little old for it"". I had managed to convince myself otherwise but after a spate of 2-3 close friends saying it again my resolve began to crumble a little. 

To be honest, I don't hold my body ""sacred"" in any respect and refuse to subscribe to the bordering on ableist desire to ""respect my body in all it's glory and never change it"" especially when it's damaging my mind which, imo, is the far more important part of me in the long run (assuming both remain relatively healthy =S).... 

Anyway, thank you for your story. I know the wait times can be 2-3 months for these things *(+ the 1 month wait to even speak to me GP ;_;)* but I'm sure it'll be worth it. Better late (or not so late) than never!
I suppose I forget this sometimes, even when explaining it to others. It's *not* something I want, you're entirely right. It's something my head does completely of its own accord....
You won't believe how many times I've received this answer and yet still I dither. That said I called the dysphoria clinic today so that's a step! <3

Awesome! That's a real big step. I'm proud of you.
Thank you... <3"	6h8kwf	trans	22	0.93	2017-06-14 16:23:25

My principal is forcing me to use a gender neutral changing room	"I'm in JROTC, and once a week we have to change into PT shirts. It's literally just ""shirt off, shirt on"". I'm stealth at this school and we asked the counselor and my instructors if I'd be able to change with the guys. There's no locker rooms or anything, the girls just go into a back room while the guys stay in the main classroom. Everyone we talked to said ""yeah, it's totally fine!""

This past Tuesday, my instructor pulled me aside and said he'd gotten news that I'd have to change in their office. I said it was okay, because like, what am I supposed to say? When I got home my mom was pretty pissed and started emailing and making calls. Meanwhile, I decided I'd just wear my PT shirt all day so I wouldn't have to change.

I go there Wednesday, the guys start stripping, and the instructor says ""wait wait, no, stop"". Pulls me aside and puts me in the office. I said, ""but I'm already changed?"" He says I just gotta stay in there. That he'll knock when everyone's done.

It's not district policy. It's illegal. I'm so humiliated because all the guys were looking at me when I came out. When we got back and had to change back, it was only me and the girls who left. It sucked. Today, I just couldn't make myself go to school. I don't feel safe or supported there at all.

My mom kept saying that she thinks the principal will work around it for us. She's been calling and sending emails all day. Right now she's on the phone with my principal and he says I have to not only use the changing room with the sex that's on my birth certificate, but that I have to use the restroom with the sex on my bc as well. I've been using the guys room for two years. My mom keeps arguing, the principal just says it's for my ""safety"". I don't feel safe at all being asked to leave the room because the guys are changing.

Looks like I'll be switching school districts."	"That is so creepy and unacceptable, im glad you're takimg action against something like that, and sorry it happend ♥
Aw guy that's horrible, your principal is a dickhead (reminds me of my own) I hope the best for you going forward and not having to face that bull again :/
Report him to the department of the Army by contacting the CID. Beter yet, have mom do it.
Nah, it's not his fault. He was emailed by an administrator after putting my medical info in the system (because binding would affect my performance in PT). We're seeking legal advice but I'm not going to go through that again."	wm6bwr	trans	22	0.86	2022-08-12 00:01:32

I was defending my standpoint on human rights on a public post. and the reason safety for Trans people and children are so critical. And they just didn't get it. Every single word was a hate filled contradiction. So I finally lost it and blurted out that I was A Trans woman and dumped a bunch of pictures to shut them up. It totally worked in case your wondering. But now literally everyone who didn't know knows. Haha oh the shit storm it caused. Any hoo I'm fine. But everyone else has lost it.

Queer friend is suicidal because his parents don’t accept him. PLEASE HELP	"My friend who wants to be a boy is starting to get suicidal ever since he came out to his parents and I am so scared of loosing him. I already try my best to be there for him but I am also dealing with mental health issues of my own which is really difficult for me since I am the only person he trusts. His family tells him that their ashamed of him everyday, that he’s ruining the family and has the devil in him. they desperately try to fix him when there’s nothing to fix about. They tell him to be normal and dress like a girl, that hes never allowed to cut his hair again (that’s also kinda my fault cause I encouraged him to cut his hair since he told me he feels more comfortable with it) ever since everything went downhill for him. he’s not allowed to be himself and is desperately struggling on his will to live. Even his sister who’s usually supportive of him is getting brainwashed by his parents and told him she’s embarrassed to go with him to church since hes ruining the family. I don’t know what to do, he tells me everyday that he can’t do it anymore and I am so afraid that his family might be putting him completely on the edge.

I made this account just for the sake of the safety of my friend. PLEASE HELP OUT I AM SO WORRIED"	"If you're in the United States, there's the National Suicide Hotline and the Trevor Project. The Trevor Project is specifically for LGBT+ folks. They're free to use and I believe at least one of them offers texting instead of call, though I can't remember which.  If you're not in the US, I recommend searching online for similar initiatives.
Are your parents or is any1 else supportive?

Take them out of that place. Hang out with them.

Not sure what country (maybe share that - not too specific)  but look at local resources for the rainbow family. Ask them & use this Google machine. Emergency housing, doctors, 24/7 crisis lines
Yeah that's difficult. Pretty tough on him and anyone who cares. Age? Is there any school counselor or support line they could talk to in confidence?

They really need an outlet and safe housing. Do you speak to the sister (older I'm guessing.) I had accepting and otherwise intelligent siblings  turned against me while being gas lit from parents. So you might get some sort of turn from the sister but unlikely.

USA?
We are seventeen, I told him we could go to the school counselor together but he literally refuses to go to anyone. I even offered him to make an appointment with a therapist together but he also refuses to :/. I don’t talk to the sister at all but it seems like she’s already turning against him now, his parents are trying to get through him by his sister by telling her to “fix” him. We don’t live in the US.

Depending on where you live, you have options. In Canada, you are considered old enough to leave home at 16, and can choose to change your guardianship at 12. Wherever you are, check out your family law and learn your rights. It would also be worth it to call Kids Help Phone, possibly a SUPPORTIVE teacher. 

You friend needs help that you are limited in providing. You can't help those who can't help themselves, it sounds like you are doing everything right. Might also be time to take you friend away for a week or two. Camping is a normal activity for teens in the summer. Time away from that family might be what he needs to make the move. 

Good luck.
Thank you!!!! Unfortunately we don’t live in the US… And my friend also doesn’t accept any help other than from me since he feels “weird” opening up and also starts to believe that there’s something “wrong” with him for feeling this way. His parents are literally the source for his brainwashing and it’s really getting into his head.
My family is supportive and I already offered him to take him in if he wants to get away, the problem is that his parents are getting into his head and quite literally brainwash him for being “wrongly” born and taking the direction of the “devil”. That also makes him not reach out for help at all and his mom is literally insane, she threatened to sue the hairdresser that cut his hair :/ and I am afraid she will also do the same when we will take him in
Either he accepts your help or not, there really isnt anything else to do.  Unfortunately you may just have to wait until they do something horrible enough to him for him to realize he needs to leave.
Fuck off transphobe
*he
I will try get him out as much as possible, the only problem is that he doesn’t want to get help since his parents are really getting to him and I feel like he’s starting to think that there’s really something “wrong” with him even though I told him countless times that there’s something wrong with his parents and not him. He’s also afraid to be on his own just because he chooses to be himself, I also think that’s why he’s refusing to get any help accessible for him.
All you can do is give him resources to get help. You can't force him to get help, no matter how badly he needs it. Just assure him that depression amd suicidal thoughts are nothing to be ashamed of, and there are qualified people out there who are ready to help when he's ready. And I cannot stress this enough: it is not on you to get him through this. It is not your burden. You're doing amazing as a friend even doing this much. Coping and recovery is a long and difficult road, but ultimately it's his journey. You can't do the driving for him. I do wish you both well though ❤ these things are never easy.
Family probably might try to go after anyone seen helping as you say. Making sure you're there without worsening it or getting the only person they have as support cut off (props because that's a fine line you're already dancing.)  Look for resources in your area, they are kinda meant for this. Definitely walk that line for them. They need someone.
Yeah as you mentioned you have things on your plate too and I've learned a few times that you can't pour from an empty cup which you at 17 seem to realise. I'll leave that alone unless you ask more.

Maybe just some fun activities away from family / church / gpop that aren't ultra gendered? Let them take point on topic of conversation?

It's a bit hard without any geographical / societal knowledge. You can DM it if that's a concern, it gives more context. For what it's worth I grew up Western (not USA) and was out of home at 16 and am now working in a full Sharia law country by choice and 0 immediate family support, don't know where they live. Also some hope for the future is a good way to brighten things. Family and school or whatever seems immediate / immovable in this moment doesn't last forever.
Thank you so much for your comforting words, it really puts me at ease. I am just afraid of loosing him since he’s already starting to push me away again and it’s really upsetting to see him dealing with all that on his own. I can’t imagine what pain he’s going through right now and it’s just painful to watch him suffer. I am sure we will make it through at the end :). There’s a Happy End for him, the one  he deserves and I am gonna make sure he will see. Thank you so much❤️
Thank you so much! I will be willing to walk that line for him and try to find as much as help as possible. It’s just so stupid that I have to look for help in the first place, since I don’t get how people try to force you to be someone you don’t want to be. ITS FRUSTRATING.
I am sorry that you had to go through that! I think the best solution right now is to distract him from his problems whenever he’s with me and have some fun. When he wants to talk, I am gonna make sure I am available. For now it just seems very difficult, I just hope I get him out of the house and do something fun. Thanks for taking your time and offering your help! I hope you have a great one <3"	v9jp84	trans	23	0.96	2022-06-10 22:47:07
Grieving my deadname/middle name at birth	"I know this sounds silly, but I'm genuinely struggling. I've tried for years to find a name that keeps my deadname's first initial, but recently, I think I've come to terms with the fact that my name won't start with the same letter as my deadname. The name I like doesn't mesh well with my middle name either, so I think I'll need to give up that name as well.

I shouldn't be taking this as hard as I am, but for some reason, I'm quite upset. I know that these are just names, but I still feel horrible that I'm unable to keep them with me. I think it has to do with me wanting to cling to my past relationships that are already beginning to sour as I take more steps to transition, as well as me just fearing change in general--these names are a huge tie to my family and a relatively safe life before I realized the extent of my dysphoria, and it feels wrong to just abandon them entirely rather than keep a piece of them with me. My middle name in particular feels like a safety blanket, as it's a gender neutral name that I've used for years to avoid coming out while still going by something more comfortable.

I don't know. This all sounds very superficial. I know the easy solution here is to just go by my middle name full time or brute force a first name with my deadname's initials, but it's like a door's been opened by this new name that I just can't close. Everyone makes ""finding your name"" sound like so much fun, but it's been oddly tough on me when I realized that it would involve giving up a part of me that's brutally complex and painful to confront. Is this common at all? Does this mean I'm not trans?"	" It doesn't sound silly. Names are powerful things and change can cause all sorts of strange feelings. 

You say they're ""just names"" but a name is the cornerstone of an entire Identity. Mourning the loss of an identity isn't unusual, the important thing is to not let it hinder you. I wonder if there's something you can do to honor the person you used to be. The mask you wore to protect yourself.

Wishing you the best of luck in finding peace in this.
I don't know if it's common but you're definitely not alone in this, and it definitely doesn't mean you're not trans -- it just means that change can be hard, especially when you're giving up something that's been a part of you for a long time. And in your case, especially because you had hoped to keep a reminder of the old name and now are finding that's not going to happen, so you're losing sort of a grounding wire that you meant to keep. Hey, if the reason you're changing the middle name is just to find something that flows better with the first name, is there a way you could make it flow with TWO middle names, your old one and a new one? IDK, it's a thought.
If you ever thought that was silly I spent daysss checking and testing names, I hate every fucking part of my dead name. Yet right now it's Hannah Brew. I'm on Mexico-
It's ok to give up your deadname.   
I remember seeing a post on IG that comforted me and perhaps it will comfort you.   
A dad told their kid that their name is like a gift and it's ok to not accept that gift. 

I chose not to accept that name and I wish my parents would knew about that when they shamed me for rejecting my legal name. (which they knew because I forgot that I put the name that I was previously going by when signing up to get a vaccine. 

I'm still finding the name that I like to go by.
My birth name is beautiful and a lot of my identity is wrapped up in it (Melody) it was always a talking point and I had truly made it my own.
I was super reluctant to give it up but it just outs me as trans immediately. I’m still salty about having to change it because society thinks it’s a girls name. However I picked a new name with some meaning to me which I love and I’m getting over it 😂.
Thank you. Hopefully I can try to find something else to ground me and keep me close to my family. Unfortunately, I don't think I'll be able to go down the two middle names route--the name I'm eyeing rhymes with my middle name, and I don't want to sound silly. Thanks for the suggestion, though!
Fully agree with everyone, you are def not alone or weird in finding this process stressful. I am struggling on even more basic steps 😅. So you are def making moves!

I just wanted to add that my given first and middle name don’t even go very well together haha. But also… and ik you want it to go well together (which is NOT superficial if it is something that makes you feel more comfortable/ confident) ….. but… devils advocate:
unless you are using/broadcasting your full name, on a regular basis, no one is going to be thinking about… or even know your middle name. 

Outside of family…off the top of my head right now I can think of 4 peoples middle names (2 bc that’s what they go by and the other 2 are Katherine 😂). 


So, I don’t have an answer to your question, but hope maybe asking one will help. 
And I don’t want it to sound like a leading question or judgey or w/e bc I just want you to find a way to make peace with your decision, whatever it may be. 

Do you think having a new middle, which flows better will bring you more joy/confidence than keeping your current middle name will bring you comfort?"	sajqtn	trans	23	0.97	2022-01-23 03:14:53
i hate that i cant just exist	i dont understand why people are trying to get rid of us for just being us. i made a post asking for advice on how to get clothes after throwing out my super girly pink part of my closet and considerably shrunk my closet and was met with advice about my gender, not about my clothes. not to mention all the shit thats going on in the us is making me fear for my safety as i live in a neighboring country. im so scared for all my trans friends and members of the community who live there. i dont understand why this is happening. why cant we just live?	"also not to mention that all this detrans stuff on twitter is really fucking with my self perception. i just accepted that i was trans and now all of that shit is being thrown up in the air again. im just so confused and wished there was a gender specialist who could help me figure this out.
IK. It’s hard. I got shamed ON. A. VIDEOGAME, for being Trans.
So I just watched an interview with Bernie Sanders on capitalism falling us in the US.

8 media companies own most outlets in the US

3 people have more than the bottom 50%

The top 1% has close to the same amount as the bottom 99%

Hospitals are run for profit.

Public services are often cut to save money from the tax cuts state governments give to the rich.

We are more productive than we've ever been.

We're making less than we've ever made.

Half of all inflation currently is likely from corporate greed.

Another portion of it is due to supply chain issues from climate change.

We are experiencing more natural disasters than ever before.

Food and housing is more expensive than ever before.

There's more income inequality than the Great Depression, even though the country's economic output is much higher than it was then.

Political PACs are places where anyone with $500 million to $1 billion dollars (the est price of a presidential election,) can be donated and spread to any candidate in the country. State senators, who arguably have as much effect on law as federal senators, often have election costs anywhere from $2000 - $20,000 depending on the size of the district. There are 1000s of politicians receiving donations from PACs every month all over the country, and legally, the public will never know where that money came from

Because the media companies are owned by the rich, no one on TV or social media really goes in depth on these issues. 

Our country is for all intents and purposes COMPLETELY falling due to our due hard dedication to making capitalism ""work."" In fact that failure is by design, to funnel cash from the poor to the ultra rich.

How do you distract from that?

Pit people against each other:

Racism, homophobia, xenophobia, climate denial, science denial, pitting employees against each other instead of bosses.

Ever noticed how when you have a problem and you call a customer service person, they act like you're crazy for having a problem? You're not. Everyone is having that problem. But we are not really talking to each other. So we think we're alone. And we get mad at the customer service person. They get mad at us. And neither of us realize that our struggle is actually united against the employer who is threatening to fire them if they don't withhold good service from us.

Scare the poor into hating each other and they will never realize how much the rich are screwing them all.

This is not new, but a tactic used by kings and emperors all throughout history. This is only a modern spin.

Just an fyi, it's not because these people are inherently hateful. It's because large corporations have created marketing profiles of all these people and force fed them a false reality.

It doesn't make them less dangerous.

But fighting other people suffering in this system is not our way to freedom.
I honestly wish I knew the answer why. If I had to guess, the conservative and far-right media fear mongering us as either groomed children who are sexually confused or predatory adults. The other guess would be that some people cant handle the idea of a woman who doesnt have cis-conforming genitalia. Some think that trans people are erasing cis people. All of the things I said are fucking incredibly stupid and wrong.
 Don't ask questions if you don't even wanna hear the answer
Fuck the Twitter stuff, it's been getting more vile every friggin day I swear. I'm not sure where you're located specifically, but you might look for online resources like Pride counseling that cater to LGBTQ persons.

Don't forget that the world is also getting better every day in other ways; protests are happening, marriages are being legalized and transition processes are being made more available. Not everywhere, but these things Are happening. Love yourself and screw everybody else.
Twitter has always been infested with brainworms. Even seeing this dogshit through the filter of my favorite content creators dunking on it was too much for me. I was gone even before the muskrat took over.

You really shouldn’t use Twitter at all anymore. The new ownership has made their stance very clear. By being on there and engaging with content on there you are feeding that beast.
I second that.. and the last part.

Cis friend here, ily all of you.	I'm just over here, a cis boy, casually going through trans boards after going from one link to another, and finding trans boards with trans memes and posts that even I love. Just wanted to say I love all the memes of self love ~~or self-deprecation~~ and the posts that are on here, and the overall safety that these boards have. I can't imagine being trans and living that complicated and sometimes burdensome or scary life and then finding safety on reddit of all places, and at this level of love too. Idk if these posts are allowed, and I'm sorry if I come off ignorant or annoying, but I know the world is a scary place and I know that cis people have a bad rep ~~usually~~ when it comes to gender stuff, but i wanted you all to know that you're amazing and powerful. I love all y'all. Trans rights.	"Thanks man, your support is much appreciated 🏳️‍🌈

Unpopular opinion: Please stop talking about states like Florida, Texas, etc. as if we're horrifically dangerous places that everyone needs to evacuate immediately. It doesn't help.	"I know this might get me some hate, but please read the full post before commenting. I'm a Florida native and, especially lately, I've been seeing a LOT of rhetoric that my state is dangerous to live in, that every queer person needs to evacuate and find other places to live, that our governor is going to round us up and take us to the firing squads, etc.

I'm not going to lie and say my state is some safe haven; it's bad. Every one of us that lives in these red states **knows** it's bad. If you're a parent of a trans kid, you have legitimate reason to get the hell out and protect your kid.

However, there are still places in the state where it's relatively safe to be visibly queer. Orlando especially is still aggressively accepting, and other cities (Miami, Tampa, etc.) have large queer communities as well, with robust support networks and regular actions and protests. Queer people can and do flourish here.

I'm not saying it's everyone's responsibility to stay and fight and risk their own personal safety. Decisions like fleeing a person's home are deeply personal, and I'm not faulting the people who leave to protect themselves or their kids.

However, when we start talking about evacuation and getting all queer people out of the state, it makes the rest of us feel abandoned, written off, like we're lost causes. There are a lot of us who can't leave or, more importantly, simply don't want to leave the community they grew up in and the friends and connections they've made over their lives to start fresh, isolated, in another state.

It does us a disservice when people who have never stepped foot in our community, who only know about Florida through national reporting on our *many* transphobic bills, pass judgements on the entire state and write us off as a dangerous place to be. 

That kind of rhetoric only stresses out those of us who can't or won't leave, and it's also **exactly what the Republican supermajority legislatures want.** Their long-term strategy is to cause everyone who disagrees with them to leave these states and further entrench their hold on the legislatures.

**It only takes 38 Republican supermajority legislatures to amend the U.S. Constitution**, and there are already **20**. If enough people flee to the same few blue states, nobody will be safe, no matter whether they're in a safe haven like New Jersey or a ""deep-red hellhole"" like Florida. And if that doesn't sound realistic to you, ask yourself whether our current situation felt realistic five or ten years ago.

The point of all this ranting is: when you're talking to someone in one of these deep-red states or talking about those states, instead of immediately encouraging them to GTFO, first help them to connect with their local queer community. See what resources there are for them in their state (e.g. to access HRT despite state bans, legal representation, etc.) and leave evacuation as a last resort. It's a much more sustainable strategy."	"You are a frog in boiling water. 

At this point in their fascist escalation it is irresponsible and even dangerous to suggest for LGBTQIA+  not to flee Florida if they have it in their power to do so. Preferably before they start setting up the ""deconversion"" camps that they've already been eluding to. I'm sorry if that makes people feel left behind. I would encourage you to get to know your local queer community in an effort to seek aide in fleeing the state. 

Your governor is breaking laws left and right to turn the state into his own little authoritarian playground, and since your state legislators are Republican majority they are happily going right along with the fascist transition. 

Florida, is at the point where they are using the force of the state to target and eliminate certain demographics of people very openly. Swing states we can argue there is a possibility of redeeming, but Florida very openly wants blood and violence. 

 I cannot understand how someone from within the groups these people are targeting can still be deceived by the illusion that we are going to be able to ""ride out the storm"" in these conservative areas. That mentality is not safe and has proven to be a terrible bet to make in times like this. History proves it is safer to relocate and fight for wider national acceptance to beat back the outliers like Florida, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and many others. 

Republicans are out for Genocide, for real.
Asking people to go to war who are ill-equipped to fight is the same as sentencing them to death. It's one thing if you want to volunteer to fight. As an adult that's your right. But we're supposed to be creating a world where children don't have these sorts of concerns for their safety and security. Obviously we're failing at that. It's time to get children and vulnerable people out of Florida.
The point of telling people to evacuate *now* is because when it's ""evacuate immediately"" it will already be too late.  

Florida Republicans, as well as in general nation wide have made it clear that getting rid of us is their.  Yes, leaving technically gives them what they want, but you will get out with your life and relative freedom.  

The question you have to ask yourself, when they decide to put ""eradicate"" into practice, will they *let* you leave?
Florida native here. 
My insurance coverage is a major factor in my decision about staying or leaving, also my ability to access health care in general.
I'm investigating a web based platform that might bridge the gap, but the increased financial burden might be prohibitive. 
I do not want to leave my home or my community, but I might have to. 
Solidarity with everyone who stays and solidarity with everyone who leaves.
I’m in Florida and my opinion is that of Michael Bolton in the movie office space. When asked why he doesn’t change his name since he hates the musician Michael Bolton so much he says why should he have to change his name, he’s not the one who sucks. I feel the same way. Why should I have to move they are the ones that suck. I am going to stay and keep fighting
Generally, I agree with you in the concept of if you flee, you can't change the system. I also agree that we have to fight for visibility and get allies to fight with us.

My biggest fear in all this is the numbers. As trans people, we aren't very many, about 1% of the population. Add to that and a lot of people, even those who would support us are uncomfortable with the whole transgender thing and that blocks them from trying to understand.

A lot of people in my social circle are what I would describe as supportive liberals, but I've gotten near complete radio silence from them when I've talked about how much the right is coming after us. Its like they don't want to engage, they don't really actually believe its happening, and I get the clear sense that if I really push the issue, I'll actually find out they have 'concerns' about trans people and that the right actually has a few good points. AAAHHHRRRRGGGHHH!!!

So, yeah, that's where I start freaking out and saying, at some point, you gotta look after yourself. I'm all for fighting the fight, but I'd also recommend keeping an eye on the escape hatch too.

Because the people who are coming after us don't care about us at all. We trans people are a complete political sacrifice to them. We're the perfect target minority: We are a pretty small group, we're easily misunderstood and demonized, and there's little political consequence for them to try to eradicate us.

Add in the general over polarization of our country, the republicans distrust in elections and their outright corruption in gerrymandering and general governance and I genuinely worry for this country. They're gunning hard for democrats, and they have absolutely no issue using us trans people to further their goals.

Ultimately, its not about us, its about their power. They're punching down on us to boost their power with their base. And as long as a big portion of this country looks at trans people with skepticism, we are endangered everywhere.

Evacuation should be a last resort, but a last resort isn't really a viable option most of the time. By the time you consider it to be time to use that last resort, it might already be too late. It's very difficult to judge when it's too dangerous to stay, and even when it is it's hard to come to terms with that. The reason people are saying to evacuate is because of that fact. It's easier to evacuate now and then if you wish to move back after the dust clears, than to get stuck in the crossfire and be in worse shape when the dust does eventually clear. 

Please note I am not American this is just my take as someone watching this unfold from an ocean away.
Just cause you aren’t being dropped in boiling water right off the bat doesn’t mean the water isn’t close to boiling.  

They’re openly talking about eradicating us in Florida.  It’s well past the point of debating whether or not to leave.  Leave NOW while you still can.  Homeless and alive in another state is better than dead or force-detransitioned in a camp.
So long as the democrats won't play dirty like the GOP, they're helping the fascists take over.  Look how they're standing by allowing all of this to happen to us.  While the attacks against us come every single day, we might get a halfhearted rule proposal once every several months, at best, or a letter with words and no action.

That being the case, we don't only need to be working on getting queer people out of red states.   We need to be working on getting queer people out of the United States altogether.  Nobody is on our side.  The 14th Amendment has forsaken us.

At this rate in another ten years, the United States will be New DPRK.  As such, we need international treaty organizations enforcing agreements with sanctions and preparing for the very real possibility that the United States will become the next rogue state to threaten the species.

The human species can either act now or wish we had while we wait for the nukes to fall.  The GOP doesn't obey the law, violates principles of democracy, and openly aspires to genocide without consequence.  It's time to accept we've already lost.
I think the idea is that sunshine (metaphorically) is curative. For instance, we saw what just happened in Tennessee. The more we talk outside of Texas and Florida, the more likely these states may feel external pressure to improve.
I'm an Australian and I'm genuinely scared of travelling to the USA. The world does not view well the fascist behaviours that a lot of the states are exhibiting.
I also just don't want to get shot. You have too many guns!
Florida is going to pass a law legalizing them kidnapping trans kids from their parents even if they are just visiting or on vacation in Florida it's outright dangerous. There is a good reason people are told to flee, Jews had some warning in Germany before it led to genocide, most didn't leave and the rest is history, actually the Nazis actually tried to ship a lot of Jewish people to other countries, Canada denied taking in Jews same as many other countries, Ron DeSantis won't put trans people on a bus or boat and try and get rid of them like that. They literally have ERADICATION on their minds it's a GLOBAL fascist movement against trans rights, they are trying to bring fascism everywhere but they can only get a hold in red states really and places like Africa legalized the death penalty for gay/LGBT+

If everyone stayed there are still way too many Maga fascists you won't make much progress at all that's another reason people are saying leave if you can, much safer for people to regroup make sure blue states stay blue, the maga fascists had a mass exodus moving out of blue states to places like Florida. Many of us I'm Canadian are exposing Floridas corrupt laws they aren't budging because Florida is full of Maga fascists DeSantis won by a large margin, if the media didn't control the flow of information then truth would show some Maga supporters they are an authoritarian Orwellian state, those two words are looked as bad by the far right, people are brainwashed by propaganda it takes time and lots of consistency exposing it for people to slowly realize they were misled, I wish people could be convinced this year just won't happen the first reaction of Maga is denial, they won't realize until they physically see concentration camps. If we had massive support exposing Florida then they may backtrack but even within the LGBT+ community barely anyone actually supports truth people aren't sharing my news articles or YouTube videos, how can progress be made with so much ignorance? Google shadow bans my news articles so they don't show on Google News even though it's setup to do so...we could get around the algorithm if people actually liked my YouTube videos so it can be shown to more people. We need to consistently share truth plant the seed and slowly more maga supporters will come to their senses it's going to be a process. If people were supporting my content Debunking antitrans misinformation and other peoples content then we could make progress this year and turn things around. It's sad. None of my friends in real life will even like my Facebook posts or YouTube videos so the algorithm can show to more people. MAGA are supporting each other a lot and I don't see many in the LGBT+ community supporting people who debunk the Misinformation.

Only a few select already popular trans activists are getting good support, we need everyone to support every trans person Debunking the lies we can't afford to say oh screw people like Megan (me) the movie disclosure pointed out that only a few trans voices are elevated seriously if people are opposing me within the LGBT community it doesn't look good. I wish it was safe for people in Florida and I'm trying I've exposed Ron DeSantis for a long time now since he went the antitrans route after tricking people to think Florida was freedom because they opposed lockdowns, I exposed how government denies science how cannabis saved lives with covid i got them checkmated on several angles and almost no support barely anyone likes any of my YouTube videos I get lots of dislikes and hate Maga are trying to make sure my content doesn't reach the masses. I've exposed details almost nobody else has. I made the sustainability Space Travel Documentary Antimatter Future antimatterfuture.com I advocate trans rights how come LGBT community is not supporting an LGBT documentary made by a trans woman? NASA are In Florida space coast, science can unite people but not if people refuse to support and share.

Everyone needs to support any source of information Debunking the lies we need the good content to be seen by more people. If there is a rise of people support media like me Debunking the antitrans misinformation we can make serious progress, since the support isn't there I blow the whistle on this, for people who choose to stay I'm still fighting and I'm Canadian would be nice if we had lots of support and could realistically say it's smarter to stay but for every trans woman like me Debunking the misinformation there are 100 antitrans media already popular. We Need lots of support not just elevating a few voices. People should be supporting debunking misinformation no questions asked I should not have had to make this post really seems Maga hijacked trans activism because explain opposition to me Debunking the misinformation? My 2k YouTube subs and lack of likes means my content doesn't reach many people my channel is not monetized

You're the second person to use this metaphor, and it's still wrong. We're not under any illusions. We **know** the water is already boiling. Again, I'm not saying it's not bad. 

What I'm saying is when people act like we're insane for not leaving, it does everyone else a disservice, especially the people who cannot leave and do not have the resources to simply flee. I'm saying there's still value in staying and helping to prop up the community, even if it might be a better/""safer"" decision for others to simply flee.

It simply doesn't feel right that the vast majority of people writing off Florida and implying people are insane to **not** be fleeing have never stepped foot in the state and have never lived in our communities.
The answer to that question is that, when they decide to put ""eradicate"" into practice, they're going to have a **lot** harder of a time rounding people up when they knock on doors and find robust communities who are armed and willing to defend themselves, instead of the dregs of the community, the least privileged, who couldn't simply up and leave. That's literally all I'm saying here; there's value in staying just as much as there's sense in leaving.
This is EXACTLY what a lot of us are saying, actually. Not unpopular at all, at least not in Florida's trans community. We've got a pretty robust anti-fascist movement here and they are not afraid to fight. Thanks for the well wishes <3
Again, I'm not saying it's not bad, but there absolutely is a place for people who choose to stay to support those who can't simply just leave. It doesn't help when people insinuate we're irrational or insane for choosing to stay and support our community, especially when they're not even from the state.
I am not implying anything on individuals. I am using my knowledge of history, politics, civil rights, law, sociology, psychology, and rhetoric, to try and explain why speaking out against fleeing fascism is wrong. 

For those who do not have the capabilities or resources to move, I will fight to aide in any way I personally can, and fight to make the system aide those people trapped in the Authoritarian capital of the United States. People who cannot flee should not be talked down to either. Which I certainly don't intend for any of this to come across as, so apologies if I've missed the mark. 

I speak with such ferocity to get the point across to people who may be less informed. They're not becoming fascist in Florida. They're already there, and leading the way for the rest of the nation to follow. Trump is a distraction at this point. People should be learning about DeSantis and what kind of monster a smart fascist is, compared to the bumbling narcissist that fueled their movement to this point.
Wouldn't be much harder for them since they'd just call the national guard. Then when the trans community fights back with weapons the Republicans will see that as justification for their laws and violence and cause more hatred among the country. 

No one's gonna be supportive of a group of people they feel like they need to tip toe around to avoid getting shot.

Wanting violence means wanting separatism. There's a difference between self defense and arming yourself. Someone who wants to self defend does not stay in hostile territory. They leave so they can advocate integration among others who are more willing to act in their favor."	12kug4h	trans	24	0.68	2023-04-13 16:18:47
I think I caused my coworker to get fired. Yeah they were transphobic but I still feel guilty for coming forward to management about my issues with them.	"So I had a coworker who was genuinely friendly and sought me out for conversations so I felt special. I liked hanging out with her because she seemed proudly androgynous. I admired her ability to hype up guests at the theme park I work at. But she always misgendered me but a lot of people do and I just stop thinking about it sometimes even though it bothers me.

But one day she introduced me to her friend and they both asked really intrusive questions in regards to my name and gender identity and also remarked on how little I pass physically. They specifically commented on my hips and lack of bottom growth. It seemed mostly to be out of ignorance that they said such hurtful things but it hurt my trust in them. I didn’t report it to leadership to begin with because I thought they wouldn’t take it seriously. 

The next time I worked, I worked with her and she really tried my patience by becoming impatient with how I was operating the ride. She didn’t understand how much work I was doing inside OCC with maintenance and leadership to correct a technical problem. She later complained incorrectly that I was on the phone. I was using the ride phone and not a cellphone and I am allowed and in fact encouraged to communicate via ride phone to get maintenance and leadership assistance. She also didn’t seem to have patience for me getting my forms organized for the day. She kept jumping the gate which is a safety violation. 

So when I was pushed to my breaking point, panicked, and shutdown, I was rendered useless until leadership came back and escorted me away. I had to tell them the truth but I still feel responsible. I know how much being let go sucks. She probably thinks I hate her but the thing is that I wanted us to get along. But she never respected me. That’s clear to me. 

I worry that this event caused management to revoke their consideration of getting me to full time. I am more resilient than it seems. Mentally I put up with more public humiliation than I will ever open up about. But so often it seems, from the outside, like I explode over a minor inconvenience. I don’t want to seem sensitive or weak. I’m tired of getting burned out in jobs I’m passionate about."	"\> ...one day she introduced me to her friend and they both asked really

Oh, she knew EXACTLY what she was doing. She is what I call a, social predator. She deserved to be fired, and I'm happy to hear that your company's HR did it. This had nothing to do with you being trans. This has to do with her being a disgusting human.

Social predators go around emotionally hurting people for pleasure. She even brought her social predator friend along to share the joy of hurting you. They ask questions that are stated in a way that they can plausibly deny any intent of harm. But their intention is to harm. I think if you reflect back on your conversations with her, and consider that she was always secretly getting off on hurting you, you might see it more clearly.
So just to be clear, she did shitty things, management found out about them, and she was punished for the things she did, right? None of that is on you, you didn't bait her, you didn't lie, she just reaped what she sowed. You can't take responsibility for the consequences of her actions.
Her behavior sounds abusive and unacceptable. And that’s what got her fired. You have nothing to be ashamed of - wanting to be treated with some amount of professionalism and human decency at work is completely within your rights.
No one gets upset for no reason, it's the fault of those who don't take the time to understand why you are upset about things that would accuse you of exploding over a minor inconveniance. 

She should have known better than to misgender you and scrurinize your appearence, that isn't just rude to trans people, that's fucking rude to everyone. 

I would suggest in the future, when someone is making you uncomfortable with stuff like that, tell them you're done talking about it. Putting your foot down lets people  know you won't put up with them.
As someone who works at an amusement park, hopping the gate would get your ass fired immediately, assuming it's into the ride envelope and during operation (even if at full stop).
They asked about your bottom growth?!!! Where's the line? Cause I can't even see it from here we're so far over it.
You shouldn't feel guilty coming forward was the right thing to do.

For one thing she was really over the line with some of the things she was saying to you.

And secondly she was literally being a safety hazard at work. 

Even without her personal issues with you someone that jumps the gate like that deserves to be fired they could get themselves or someone else hurt very badly.

You didn't do anything wrong here. You had a socially abusive coworker who was also a safety hazard.

Edit: I can't emphasize this enough. This was not your fault. She brought it on herself by being both personally abusive transphobic,  and  being a walking safety hazard.  You have nothing to be guilty about you did the right thing by finally reporting it. 

 Someone who doesn't respect their coworkers or safety regulations does not have any business working a potentially dangerous job like amusement park rides.  You probably saved people from an accident happening with her jumping the gate again.
You should never feel bad about getting a wanker sacked, especially if that wanker is cruel toward you or anyone else
Yeah it just sucks as an Autistic person because I always fall in with people like this who treat me nice and then hurt me. I feel betrayed every time and people wonder why I don’t make friends anymore. I almost prefer the guys here who just act like everything I say is completely out there, like I’m a freak. I know I’m not cool and socially I’m a failure because Autism makes communication hard for me. Cis men know they’re better than me…they think they are anyway. If they knew half of what I’ve been through…
I don’t even correct people who misgender me. It’s taking a lot to demand respect but after everything I have gone through, I deserve it.
Exactly. I'm the same way cuz cis world, but, disrespect like being critical of my body will not be tolerated, and you shouldn't tolerate it either."	uw8z4s	trans	23	0.9	2022-05-23 20:02:31

DO NOT JOIN THE MILITARY..	So with the lifting of the transgender restriction (was never a ban on them serving. Just required 5-8 years on hrt to where they were emotionally stable with or without them hormones.) I wanted to post this. The reason for this restricrion is due to the high suicide rate in transgender soldiers. Imagine being in a warzone or overseas for a year with no hormones.. okay? Its much harder if you havent experienced it. IF you want to join please wait to start hrt or wait 5 to 8 years FOR YOUR safety.. I care about everyone in this community and that suicide rate is a number i dont want to see skyrocket.. Look out for each other 💞💖. Stay safe	"It's also not the ""win"" we need for this reason and the fact that we have so much to fight for on the homefront
That is good advice for anyone. Being in the military sucks ass, and not in a good way. It's basically indentured servitude.

Not to mention that the military is chock full of wrong-wing wackos who writes in their daydream journals about different ways of torturing and killing people like you.

Then imagine if such a person is above you in the chain of command. I've had something like that happen to me and it is a living hell.

If you want to join something that takes you halfway around the world, join the damn Peace Corps or something.

And whatever you do, don't become a Scientologist. They're worse than the military!

I know I don't pass well but I'm closeted for safety. Any passing tips?		"Here are a few things I do
- keeping your hair out of your eyes can be seen as more masculine and more confident 
- black hoodies are really good if you can get a binder
- use contour to make your face look more square (there are plenty of videos on YouTube to do this)
- look up vocal deepening videos and practices them it helped me a bit

Remember to stay strong!
Hello. Thanks for sharing this. Don't pass? Oh yes you do totally. Beautiful face & amazing potential. You need to do 1 thing only. Ditch that hat & grow out your hair- boom done. Please have hope cause I promise you look great. I'm a mtf almost 23, & nearly 1yr into HRT
I'm ftm btw
Yeah, to be perfectly honest, I got a bit confused too. Thought you were a pre-HRT MTF. That's a good thing. A very good thing.

&#x200B;

Dude, you can totally pass with ease! When I first saw you my instinct said 'boy'! You got a great mini-androgyny thing going on, but yeah, just a few touchups here and there and boom, full dude. Congrats man!

Damn do I love seeing trans brothers here. I never liked the erasure you guys get. So the more visibility, the better. Keep up the great work.
This 's amazing thank you
Oh no thank you but I should have clarified ftm
Thank you
Oh my sorry! Well than keep the hat & keep that hair style cause it reads masculine😊 You got this✊
I've gotten confused for being mtf before so it's ok ahaha
I felt awful. But I seriously thought you were a male but with a few feminine aspects. I think HRT aka T will do wonders for you as ftm. Love that t-shirt btw. Good luck on your journey😊
It happened to me in a target restroom once, I find it more funny hana
Honestly you'd look good in either gender. You're one of those people who's like in between & reads both lol. Glad you don't feel upset😉 I'm happy for you & your journey to being the boy you are inside.
Thanks hon

The Human Rights Committee Almost Destroyed My Life	" 

So, the HRC (Human Rights Committee) just sent me some mail. It was basically one of their mildly aggressive ""join our membership so we can fight for *YOUR* rights as a person in the LGBTQ+ community!!!"" Had a sticker, membership card, everything. Awesome. Normally I'm really happy when this stuff shows up to my apartment, which is in a different state.

Except

This mail arrived at my parents NEW address

In my DeadName

Where I no longer live or legally reside. (Due to weird laws in the state I attend college/actually live, I can't become a state citizen until I am out of college, so my legal address is my grandparents' house). My parents moved a while ago, and I've never lived in this location. It isn't my legal address. I honestly didn't even know my parents' new address, I hadn't visited since they moved and I hadn't needed to mail anything to them.

My parents are highly homophobic and often snoop in my mail. I was ***THIS*** close to being outted by HRC. Ya know, the organization fighting for LGBT rights and ***SAFETY***? Yeah, *that* committee. The committee that just put my life in danger AND almost cut me off completely from my family. I'm in the closet for a GODDAMN REASON. I live in a completely different state.

I still depend on them in some ways for food and rent due to being unable to work full-time while I'm in college. Also, I'd like to maintain a relationship with my sister, who is a minor and would probably be banned from communicating with me if my parents disowned me. Also, Idk, maybe I haven't come to terms with the fact that my parents might not really love me for who I am so I'm afraid to cut that illusion off? but D*ON'T JUDGE ME on that part, THe point is that thAT'S MY DECISION,* ***NOT*** ***HRC'S.***

*TL,DR;*

**I DIDN'T EVEN KNOW MY OWN PARENTS' ADDRESS**. HRC SOMEHOW DID, AND MAILED DAMNING THINGS TO ME THERE. IT WAS SPECIFICALLY ADDRESSED TO MY PARENTS' ADDRESS so it's not like it was addressed by mistake to their previous house and forwarded here.

Second, They're already suspicious. Obviously.

Mel R. Groves was a victim of such deep systemic violence. [Please Share]	"For the last few days, all I have been thinking about is how this culture of transphobia, racism and cissexism ultimately led to Mel’s murder. 

I think a lot about how his immediate family turned their back on him the moment he came out as trans, a fact not to be disputed because they have literally been absent from his life for the last 5 years. Since he was 19 years old, Mel had to deal with persistent discrimination, poverty, homelessness, victimization and criminalization.

Mel was discriminated against while he was at Tuskegee university, and he felt that blatant transphobia inside and outside of the classroom. Professors refused to use his chosen name and pronouns. He was just 19 and 300 miles away from home, but university housing denied him safe and affirming housing.

While he lived off campus, Mel was the victim of numerous transphobic assaults. Over and over, he’d been beaten up, robbed, threatened and worse. He had to leave school, where he had a full scholarship because he couldn’t make it work. He needed time to just survive and meet his basic needs. He needed safety and security that he just didn’t have.

Mel was on the streets periodically. He had his demons, but please let us not pretend like they came from nowhere. Mel had very little resources in his position. Which shelter was he going to go to? Which national organization was he going to turn to? His own community was struggling to survive around him. Where could he go? What was he supposed to do?

I think a lot about how his interactions with the police only exacerbated everything that he had going on. Black cis men regularly talk about how horrifying it is to be in the custody of a system that doesn’t see value in them. Mel interacted with a system that didn’t and doesn’t see humanity in him, with officers who brutally abused him not only because he was a black man but because he was a black trans man. 

Mel embodied resilience. Up until Monday, Mel was a survivor of all that violence, all of that transphobia, all of that cissexism. Mel did his best in this world that was so determined to kill him every step of the way.  Every day, he kept getting back up. Every day, he kept waking up to a world where he felt depressed, disregarded and dehumanized. He persevered through an experience that would have irreparably broken anyone. 

In the last few months of his life, Mel was able forge a better life for himself with the support of Que Bell and The Knights & Orchids Inc. - TKO. Mel was in school again and working, hustling to get housing and documents together. For a time, there was nothing but forward movement, with the momentum getting stronger every day. Even when things started to fall apart again, Mel still kept resisting. He kept surviving. Bleeding to death behind the wheel of his car, he fought to live, to see another day, to see all of us in his chosen family one more time.

Mel wore the scars of a survivor when he should have been an adolescent, a young man safe and secure in college with an affirming and uplifting family at home. He should have been playing sports with friends, scrambling to get assignments in on time and hustling for a little extra pocket change to buy the latest video games. He should have had a university that protected him, a state that stood by him and a country that defended him. 

Instead, Mel was a victim of violent transphobia, racism, and cissexism. A war was waged against Mel by a culture that devalues black trans lives, a culture that threatens every black trans person. It is a tragedy that this system which has been killing some of the most vulnerable people in US society - our black trans youth - for so long will continue to take our youth from us, just like it took Mel."

I'm fucking scared	"After hearing about the death of Brianna Ghey, I've been really scared. It's been about 4 days since her death, and who knows how many more will die? I'm (ftm) the same age as her, and I'm really worried about my safety. Not only do I have to worry about my rights for gender affirming care in the US, but I now have to worry about if I'll even make it to the next day. I'm scared. 

Now, I go to a school that's pretty accepting, but there's still a lot of conservatives there since it's a PWI in a red state. I don't want to live there anymore. I want to leave. But that's not really possible for me since my family cannot afford to move out. So I'm stuck here until I save up to move or get killed. I don't know what to do anymore."	"❤️❤️❤️
I'm not gonna lie. Things are scary right now, even for us adults. You're 16,  right? The best thing you can do now is make a plan. If you don't have a part-time job, now might be a good time to get one and save every penny you can with the plan of moving out the SECOND you're 18 to get to a blue state. You'll likely have to either go to college out of state or find a roommate to do that. 

Please don't give up. There are still some safe places left where we can live a normal life. We have to fight to keep every right we possibly can. And we need every last trans person to stay alive and help us. You are young but more powerful than you know. You, as the next generation, have the power and responsibility to change history. Be cautious and keep your guard up but not so much that you stop living. I'm a bit of a hypocrite for saying that I guess, but damnit there's nothing more important than that this next generation of trans youth stands up and refuses to be the next punching bag for the right.
Yeah I'm 16. Thanks for the support! I do plan on getting a job in the summer, im planning on working at a movie theater full time during the summer and part time during school. I will also be selling art work in a local artist market in April so that'd probably get me a few hundred dollars.

My girlfriend is tired of being a secret and so am I	"So recently I had a conversation with my girlfriend (currently ex but it’s more complicated) about me coming out and her feelings around my family not knowing about her. For context, I’m trans (ftm) and I’m bisexual. I’ve come out as bisexual but not trans and I did have a plan to come out by the time I graduated (which was early June) and I never stuck it through. 

I’ve grown comfortable with my situation but I’ve ultimately lost the woman that I believe is the love of my life. She’s willing to wait for me but she isn’t willing to wait for years for me to finally come out and be who I am because she can’t stay in the closet with me. I understand where she’s coming from. 

I don’t know how my family will react but I do know that I’m just as tired of keeping myself a secret from my family as my girlfriend is. I guess what I’m asking for through this post is some help towards coming out. I don’t know how to drive and I do have a job of my own but that’s about all I have in terms of a safety net."	"If you are in a situation that you won't be put in danger by coming out, you should come out.

I'd mention LGBT things around your parents and guage how accepting they are. Based on that you should know whether it's safe to come out or not.

If you're not dependant on your family it's possible to cut ties if they reactly negatively
When I came out as trans to my parents I wrote a letter and read from it. This was to make sure I didn't forget anything and also it's easier to look at a paper than faces haha
Hmmm this is tough. If it doesn't compromise your living situation, coming out is fine. But you also shouldn't feel obliged to come out for someone else's sake, regardless of how much you love them. You come out when it feels right for *you.* But thats just my hot take. I hope you'll be accepted with open arms and hearts.
My mom has been pretty supportive of me being bi but idk if that extends to me being trans so I’ll definitely try out bringing up the topics. Thank you so much for your advice!
It’s okay if this question is too personal but how did they react to this? How did you build up to it? Did you just ask to talk to them or?
She told me the same thing. She told me she doesn’t want me to come out for her but for myself, it’s just that she can’t wait forever for me to be ready. I do feel ready I just don’t think I’m in the right position to come out as of now, thank you for this though. Hearing it come from someone else makes me feel validated
Trigger warning ⚠️ 

Tldr: it went horribly. But things got better over time

Long version: I was in a psychward for suicidal intentions. We had a family meeting about halfway through my stay.  A social worker was present which made things easier. 

I had written a letter. It was short. I read it aloud.. Something like ""mom, dad, I love you. I have something to tell you. I'm trans. My name is marceline. I hope you accept me."" Something like that. I don't remember it exactly. I think I have it somewhere. 

Their reaction was awful. Immediately they denied my identity, said I was a man, said my deadname. They both started to cry. To be fair I cried the whole time lol

I mentioned that trans people without support from their family are in danger of suicide. To which they said I was emotionally blackmailing them. Nice right.

Without much else being said they left. The social worker turned to me and said ""that did not go well.""

Overall I'm glad I did it 1) with a letter 2) with a support present. I knew it was going to go poorly but them being there made sure it didn't get physical.

Fast forward several years and things are much better.

I always recommend everyone come out as soon as you can. Hurts like heck but for real it is a relief. Like pulling out a splinter.
Yeah that's the thing, sometimes we might be emotionally ready but our environment just isn't there yet. I personally wouldn't reveal anything until you're certain you'll be safe or you have a way out if you aren't. I'd lowkey bring up topics that are trans adjacent to see what sort of reactions you get.
I’m really proud of you for getting through something that difficult. If anything it gives me hope that I can be just as brave as you are 

I don’t think it’ll go this bad but I don’t have super high hopes. Your idea to use a letter is perfect though and I’m gonna go ahead and write one while I learn how to drive to better get my independence. 

Honestly this really did help…thank you so much for this. I want to come out badly honestly, I wish I had in June and I think a letter would’ve made it an actual present thing for me to go through with it so again, thanks for the letter suggestion. 

This means the world to me, so much more than you might think. Thank you for the dose of hope and reality

Trans Day of Visibility is for YOU, even if you're questioning or not out yet.	"This is for EVERY TRANS PERSON WHO’S NOT OUT YET, but also so cis people can understand what a double-edged sword it is. 

This post is also known as THIS IS NOT FOR YOU aka GATEKEEPING aka AM I TRANS ENOUGH. By which I mean the kind that others do, directed at us, but also of the kind that we do to ourselves.

I was fairly sure I was trans for a long time, but I knew I couldn’t transition until a certain date, so I took my time exploring things and figuring myself out. That doesn’t mean I was any less transgender, though. I’ve been trans my whole life.

If you’re trans you’ve always been trans and nothing can change that (just like you cisgender folks can probably realize there’s nothing in the world that would make you suddenly not cis). It’s just who you are.

And so for a long time, things like Trans Day of Visibility were really painful for me. Because here is a thing that was SPECIFICALLY FOR ME, and yet it was NOT FOR ME because as far as the world knew I was just a cisgender man.

That was so, so difficult to deal with. I’d see opportunities for trans writers… people who wanted to read us, help us get staffed or get our projects in front of the people who could make them happen, and there was nothing I could do about it.

I had to watch those opportunities dissolve because they were NOT FOR ME, even though they WERE FOR ME! And I really never needed that extra pain on top of all the pain that gender dysphoria already brought me. 

It’s a special kind of hell seeing a thing meant to help you that you cannot get to. I couldn’t even celebrate pride month, because again as far as the world knew I was just a straight guy. I mean I could have said I was bi, but that felt like lying. It’s ladies for me, thanks.

It got to the point where, in the months before I came out, my wife and I were saying we were a “LGBTQ+ writing team.” Which is true, if suuuuuuuuuuper vague, but it was the best I was comfortable with at the time.

After coming out that bit got easier, obviously, but a new problem presented itself. And it’s one I’ve heard echoed by a lot of trans people I’ve talked to: AM I TRANS ENOUGH?

I had this… this GUILT, I guess, at calling myself transgender. Even though I CLEARLY AM. Because Trans Person A did X thing, and I didn’t. Trans Person B did Y thing and I don’t want to ever do that.

So am I even “trans enough” to call myself transgender? Am I disrespecting and denigrating the people whose dysphoria is worse than mine? I mean hell, mine never came with the severe depression that so many experience.

And what’s even worse is that I’ve seen this kind of attitude from some trans people. There are those who say you’re not “really” trans if you don’t get bottom surgery, or if you’re not on hormones, or if you don’t do X, Y, or Z.

I don’t know how much that contributes to the feelings of not being trans enough, for me. I never bought into that bullshit but who knows about all the little ways these things can affect us that we might not even realize.

I’m sure it impacts some others, though. Imagine a trans person just beginning to explore what being trans means to them and wanting to transition, and seeing those things and feeling they wouldn’t be accepted if they didn’t conform to some arbitrary standard.

It’s kinda horrible. I’m a member of a lot of different trans communities and a lot of them are wonderful and affirming and supportive. But in some I can see cliques forming, and it saddens me.

And it’s such a complicated thing, because trans people have spent our entire lives feeling excluded, and left out, and like we’re not part of things. So once we get to be included, there’s this feeling of wanting to keep it closed, to keep it safe.

Which is of course SUPER important with the amount of harassment we often face. But think about how those who are excluded feel… you’re accepted into this community, but only so far. You don’t get to be part of all of it because someone else hasn’t decided you can be, yet.

And that really sucks, doubly so after never feeling like you belonged or had anyone to talk to about all these weird feelings you were going through in trying to figure out your gender and whether you wanted to transition or not.

And that can definitely play into (or exacerbate) the feeling of not being trans enough, even if unintentional. And that breaks my heart. I don’t want anyone to ever have to feel that way. We’ve been through enough.

But there’s another aspect of Trans Day of Visibility you may not have realized, the aforementioned double-edged sword. We NEED to be seen as who we really are, and have our rights and autonomy respected. But being more visible puts you more at risk.

Coming out wasn’t an issue of safety for me, at least as far as my immediate home life. And I live in California, where I'm respected for who I am. But for so many others it’s dangerous. Even if not in their immediate household, all the states trying to legislate us out of existence is terrifying.

A reminder (though damn, I hope you don’t need to be reminded) that there has been more anti-trans legislation introduced in THREE MONTHS in 2022 than there was in all of last year, which held the previous record. It’s unprecedented and horrific.  
[https://www.themarysue.com/why-are-there-so-many-bills-targeting-trans-kids/](https://www.themarysue.com/why-are-there-so-many-bills-targeting-trans-kids/)

Can you imagine trying to come out under these conditions? Why it almost seems like Republicans want to make it impossible to do so. But news flash: that won’t stop people from being trans. You can’t force people who make you uncomfortable to change their gender, pops.

So this is for all the people who are questioning, idly or actively. It’s for the ones who aren’t sure if they’re trans enough, or if they can or should come out, or if things meant for trans people are also for them.

I’m here to tell you YOU’RE TRANS IF YOU SAY YOU ARE. 

NOBODY KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN YOU. 

There is no “enough” to being trans. Whether you want every surgery you can get, or only some, or none. Or all the hormone replacement therapy, or only some, or none. 

If you can’t come out for any reason, you’re still trans. Whether you only want to transition socially, or can’t (or don’t want to!) transition at all: YOU ARE STILL TRANS IF YOU SAY YOU ARE.  
If you want to come out, I believe in you and you can do it when the time is right. If you can’t, that’s okay too. If you’re just questioning and unsure, that is also okay! You’re wonderful and valid and can and should be exactly who you want to be. Who you ARE.

I see you. And you are enough."	"God I'm really feeling this right now, I really only figured myself out recently, so the feeling of belonging isn't quite there for me just yet. Hell, even commenting here has taken a lot of courage
It's definitely tough at first, but know you've already taken such big and important steps to becoming the true you. Go at your own pace, and don't let anyone tell you what you do or don't have to do. It's all up to you, and what you discover is right for you.

Rant: do people really think we choose to be trans because it makes life easier? (CW: transphobia, sexism)	"I know quora is a horrible source for information but seeing as how it was the second thing that came up when I searched ""why are there more MTFs than FTMs"" I thought I'd check it out to see what people were saying. Oh man do I regret that. 

The top answer on there was from some guy claiming the primary reason more amabs choose to transition is because women have it ""so much easier in life"" I'll spare you the details of his horrible argument, if you really wanna know what he said you can look it up but he spewed the usual ""men's rights"" bs about work place injuries and how women don't need to put any effort into dating etc. And used this to explain why more people are MTF.

Not only does this ignore the fact that women DO NOT have it better than men in many areas of life (career opportunities, safety, getting respect, I could go on but you get the point) but it also completely disregards how hard it is to be trans in any society. We're the constant target of hostile legislation trying to strip our rights. We have the highest suicide rate of any group. Hate crimes against us are the norm. Many of us have lost jobs, friends and families because of who we are!

The idea that I CHOOSE to be like this is INSANE. I spend nearly every day in a constant state of misery because I can't just be myself without being rejected by society. If it was a choice to be trans it would've been one of the WORST decisions I ever made. If I could be happy as a cis man I would do that in a heart beat. But I'm not. This is not a choice I or anyone else made to gain a leg up in society BECAUSE IT DOES THE EXACT OPPOSITE. 

I'm so mad that people think like this. Sorry for the rant but I'm obviously pretty upset and needed a place to share my thoughts after bawling my eyes out. 

Stay strong everyone 💜💜"	"Yeah its pretty disgusting how people view our community. They either think we are mentally ill or seeking attention. They fail to realize we just want to live our lives like the rest of the worlds people. And it never fails to amaze me that sexism is so prevalent that people think MTF people transition for an easier time in life, its like really people do you not realize the target i just painted on my forehead.
I had the same reaction when I read something similar, I still remember that fateful day where I’m like am I really going to look up “what is the ration of trans mtf vs ftm” but yeah, IDK if you want to talk about it feel free to dm me other than that, I get you.
Let's just read this bunch of stupid 

>There are more MTFs than FTMs today, because women’s lives are so much better than men’s lives.

Being trans is not a choice

>Women can chose a traditional gender role or a more equal gender role but regardless, men are still expected to be the primary breadwinners.

They can't always choose the more equal gender role and also some males are still gonna act like they're superior to women.

>Women lead entited lives of priviledge and men lead lives of servitude.

Are. You. Brain-dead?!

>A female can verbally or physically assault a male with little or no consequences, legally or otherwise but the converse is not true. If a male reports that he was verbal or physical assaulted by a female, rarely if ever, will he be taken seriously by the law or by society. He will instead be told to “be a man” and “suck it up”. There are very few domestic shelters for males abused by females.

His conment is just a bunch of garbage text, but I think this is actually true and thus a problem.

>When men are single, our society requires men to have to deal with rejection to ask women out, but women are not required to do the same. Men have to be charming, funny, attractive, etc. and buy women drinks and meals and compete with other men, when they want women to go out with them. Women can just sit back and pick and chose which men they want to take them out. It is like a queen picking which slave will serve her

Sorry, that's how nature works sadly. Also, why don't you just NOT date? Problem solved.

>Men have to propose, risking rejection and/or embarrassment, and buy an expensive ring (the norm being 2 months of income).

Or you just DON'T get married. You don't HAVE to get married.

>98% of military casualties are men.

98% of the Military is men so that doesn't count.

>93% of prison inmates are men.

Doesn't that mean that men commit more crimes then women?

>Men then have to revert to the single life where he has to compete with other men to win the affection of a woman.

Or not. Why does nobody understand that being single is an option?
Just a thought, but there could be more MTFs due to the way sex is assigned. Common knowledge that everyone starts in a template similar to that of a girl when growing (in the womb).

So perhaps, since a woman is more likely to produce estrogen and such, so it means MTFs are more likely to be exposed to the hormone at a level and time that changes our brain chemistry or something? 

For FTM it would just be a lower chance as women naturally don't produce as much testosterone, so there's less chance of exposure at a certain time of development?

For non-binary folk? Honestly no clue, perhaps an eldritch being opened space and time and blessed them whilst in the womb. 

Just rambling thoughts. I'm sure scientists will figure it out eventually. It could be equal, and there's something in society that prevents the results from showing clearly.
Yup because who wants to give up the happenstance jackpot of being born with cis male white privilege in the US to be one of the most stigmatized minority groups in society today. Yup gave up a winning mega millions ticket for transphobia, dysphoria, sexism, attacks on job and housing opportunities,  a 42% suicide rate due to the amount of people who's family and friends abandon you, and get to spend years fighting with a for profit medical system that cares more about whether they can make a dollar off me than if they should cover my HRT. MAKES COMPLETE SENSE.
Sorry for the rant, that's some of the same logic my family had used to discredit me and my existence and it kind of gets under my skin."	mixp4b	trans	20	0.92	2021-04-03 00:39:09
First proper night out as myself. Amazing night, terrible ending.	"I've been out as a transwoman for a few months now, and apart from some issues with my family my day to day life has improved dramatically. Until last week I didn't have any trans friends though, so I popped to my local LGBT foundation and joined a group. Met a translady there who invited me for a night out yesterday.   


I was super excited, make up was on point, got all dressed up in new clothes and bootheels I got for Christmas. Unfortunately when I arrived it turned out she had gone out early because she was bored and was already very drunk. She had to go and I was stuck with her friends... who she had met that day. And then soon after two of them had to go early too.   


So I was left with the only other person who had arrived at a similar time to me, a lesbian from London who wanted to check out the local gay village (I'm from Manchester). Neither of us knew each other but we'd both come for a night out and we agreed to go for it together.   


What followed was one of the most amazing nights I'd ever had. We had a conversation about queerness that I'd needed for a while. She assured me that she saw me unequivocally as a woman and the way everyone treated me all night reinforced this. Complimented by other women in the loos, hit on by a lesbian, and met a few more trans people. She even convinced me to come with her to Vanilla, which is a lesbian bar - this being Manchester I knew I shouldn't have been worried, but I was terrified before going in. Everyone was lovely to me in there though.   


Unfortunately, it all went wrong when she decided to go home. I was pretty tired myself (and very drunk!) so I was gonna get a taxi. But these two lads came up to me and were very complimentary and charming. Being naive I fell for it and when they suddenly disappeared I realised they had pickpocketed my purse and phone. Immediate emotional crash, and in the midst of my panic some guy pulled up next to me and tried to solicit me as a prostitute. After such an amazing night it was like hitting a brick wall.   


Fortunately the Village Angels sorted me out, dealt with my panicking, drunk crying self in a lovely manner and got me home in a police car.  I can't thank them enough.   


I learned a couple of things last night. I love myself, and I love living as a woman. I already knew this - my life has just been better since I started presenting as myself and I'm generally happier, but last night was really special. I have never felt so legitimised. But I had a very rude awakening about safety and looking after myself. Despite not yet making any physical changes, I am more vulnerable now than I was before and I need to be far more careful, even in spaces I consider safe like the village.   


TL;DR: Amazing affirming night ruined by a robbery at the end. I learned a harsh lesson about the difference between being perceived as a man and a woman and the dangers involved."	">But I had a very rude awakening about safety and looking after myself.

Im sad you experienced this, but it's good that you did and didn't get hurt. I've had similar rude awakenings, and all but one of them turned out to be fairly harmless. But one occasion I was sexually assaulted, and at that moment is when I realized that I could not defend myself. I was as scared as I've ever been in my entire life. 

But since then I've made changes to my lifestyle with that in mind. When I can, I am armed. And if I can't, I try to go out with other women, or men because we are safer in numbers. 💕E
Wow!  What a roller-coaster in the space of one night!  Sorry about the bad spots, but I'm glad you are safe.  Slow down a little, girlfriend!  One step at a time!  ❤️

By the way, I found that my tolerance for alcohol was lower as HRT progressed: a given amount of alcohol hits me much harder now, so I've had to ratchet back a little on drinking,  Not sure if you are on HRT, but just thought it might be a good thing to mention.
That’s downright terrible and upsetting to hear there at the end. I’m so sorry a night like that was ruined in such a screwed up way.

Do you have the ability to track your phone to help police find it?
Oh gosh, I'm so sorry that happened. 

My mum carries a cudgel with her when she's out on her own, I'll probably start doing similar. And next time I'll make sure I go out with people I actually know.
I'm British so I'm probably a couple of years before I can make start HRT sadly. :( But yes, I felt really, really stupid and embarrassed. I was gonna replace my phone soon anyway (though I am upset that I've lost all my transition selfies) and I've cancelled my card so in real terms I've only really lost £20. But the fact I was so naive messed me up. I'm trying to focus on the positives but I do still feel crap.   


Thanks for the comment. Getting it written out has helped me process. I'll definitely be more careful next time. <3
There's not, but fortunately I already had a replacement and was gonna switch my sim over soon anyway, so I've cancelled it and am just waiting for my provider to send a new SIM. I only had £20 in my purse so in real terms I haven't lost much, I was hurt more emotionally by what happened.
Thank you. I wasn't physically injured, but that was a rude awakening to beat all rude awakenings. I took it as a learning experience. 

And the funny thing was, I have had hand to hand combat training in the past. But without any strength I was helpless. I didn't want to start fighting because I didn't want to get the shit beat out of me. 

Taking our own safety into consideration is something many of us didn't have to do before transitioning, as we were more than capable of Defending ourselves.

Situational awareness is key, and don't forget your wingwoman! 💕E
Learn from the rough spots, but treasure the good moments!  💋
I haven't physically changed my body yet, but I've never been a fighter. Thing is though, just because I appeared masculine I was generally left alone, nothing like what happened to me last night has ever happened before.   


Definitely gonna avoid being alone and drunk in future. Felt so naive and stupid."	egwxin	trans	19	1.0	2019-12-28 21:58:57
Calling out of work?	So I’m 19 and transgender. On Sunday at work half way through my shift I got approached by this woman who asked me for help, soon as I turned around she saw a pin on my vest of a trans flag, I’m guessing she wasn’t a fan as she started going on and on about how trans people are the filth of this world and how they all deserve to die, she also told me that she should be taking off her shoe and beat me with it as I’m deserving of it since I’m trans, this is basically word for word what she said. 15 mins after that I tried to regain composure and complete my shift, but I couldn’t… It kept eating me up inside and I told hr what happened and I left early that night, now a couple days later it’s Thursday and I have my next shift tonight. I’m terrified, not for this woman or my safety but feeling trapped that I have to put my mental health aside and as everyone says “be an adult” while this is valid and there is truth to it, it weirdly makes me feel dismissed. Maybe I just want some advice on how I can handle my emotions and the feeling of being trapped at work and putting my mental health aside. Any tips would be fantastic thank you. Made this post on my works subreddit too… but this is a trans issue as well and all the work subreddits are riddled with work junkies who think I should work 24/7 and not complain so now I’m here	"Mental health is health, so you are well within your right to call in a sick day ❤️
I'm not sure what field you're in but if you can't focus on the work that day, that's exactly what sick days are for (aside from the obvious preventing the spread of disease  that is :) )
Once a customer threatens you, they should be refused service and trespassed if they don’t leave. At one of the jobs I’ve had, a customer started throwing shit at my cashier and I stepped in between them and told her to leave immediately or I was calling the cops. 

If your management won’t step in to protect you from abuse, you’re not working where you need to be. Unfortunately it can take time to find a job that is actually run by decent people, but NO JOB is worth you feeling anxious about going in, especially when that anxiety lasts literal days. 

Personally, if you like the job you have now, I’d recommend going in to your shift (this or the next depending on how you’re actually feeling) and talking to your boss(es) about it. Explain you were threatened with violence and you shouldn’t have to put up with it. Request that in the future any guest who is violent/cussing/overly rude/etc can be told to leave upon threat of the cops coming to trespass them. 

If they say no, I’d tel them your safety is not a compromise and put your notice in right there if you will be able to safely do so - ie won’t lose your home/car/anything you need to survive. 

There is always a better job around the corner somewhere when you need it. Just might take some time to really find it.
if people at work are telling you to put up with that, it's time to find a different place to work. I work at Kohl's and if a customer tried to pull that, half our staff would be violently glaring at them as they're dragged out of the store and banned
Imagine being so confrontational that you can't even enter a store without descending into death threats and violence. What a psychopath
Fuck that. Don’t. If work makes you feel like shit, for one reason or another, then don’t do it- you deserve better!!
I worked at home depot in the past so it was hardcore like that by customers. I’m sorry this is happening. I personally would have taken the smart ass route by saying if you don’t need anything, I have task to do and walk away. I always have a rule that if I need a day, I’m taking the day as no retail job for 11-15 a hour is worth my health.
Heres a thought stand up for your fucking self and dont be a passive bitch. Haha dont take this as harsh, this is the same advice i would give to myself! And have many many times. There are bullies everywhere. Living life is learning how to deal with them. The best way, IMO, is to shut down their shit in an insant, if they go to 10 then go to 11. Excercise, work out, and practice your fight stance. Being trans doesnt mean being soft whatsoever. It will make you a target and you just gotta realize that and be mentally and physically prepared. Remember its about heart. If you got that then nobody can ever harm you mentally, and they will sure as hell have to try phsyically.
As someone whose your age and has basically worked in customer service since I was sixteen, I’d say call out! As long as you haven’t used up all your days you should be fine. 

My advice, don’t do what the work junkies say. They may not ever call out for mental health days but that’s why they’re so damn bitter. Your job has been able to run before you even applied, they’ll make it through a day without you being there. It may be a tight shift without you but that’s a problem they can get through their self. And as for the customers who act like that, you do NOT have to put up with them. And just her mentioning she ought to hit you with her shoe proves she may have had the intent of physically assaulting you. I would have a talk to your managers and see if they can do anything about her being banned from the premises. Working customer service is hard (especially if you’re trans) but eventually you learn to deal with ppl like that.
Thank you, it really means a lot… I’m just not in the mental state to go in tonight, I’m a full time college student yet work at target in the evenings. I just need to think about things… think about myself and think about how I can be the person I want. I don’t want to cower in fear like I did… but I was so scared…
If you can’t go in, don’t. US-based answer but - Your health and safety should be your priority. If necessary, and possible, go to a clinic and tell a doctor your anxiety is bad and most of the time they’ll write you a note off work for 1-3 days depending on what you want/need.
So I have a medical note from my therapist and doctors that explains everything, also I’m very friendly with the head of HR and they absolutely know everything that goes on with me so they usually just will take me off the schedule."	12dpbob	trans	19	0.77	2023-04-06 16:20:08
How can a trans girl stay safe when out drinking?	"What are some things I should do, look out for, and be prepared for?

All the experience I have in bars and at parties is as a guy, where my biggest safety concern was people wanting to fight. This weekend I'm going out with some guy friends who I trust, but am 48kg lighter, a girl, and not confident in passing 100% to 100% of people, so I'm a little worried."	"It's pretty much the same rules that any other girl would follow.  

Be aware of your surroundings. Make sure your friends are nearby and that you're never left alone. Don't leave drinks unattended. Don't go down dark alleys. Stay in groups of people when possible. Don't engage with people who seem sketchy. Don't go home/leave with anyone you don't know. Prioritize your safety at all times and follow your gut instinct. If something feels wrong, remove yourself from the situation.
It might not be as crucial as you think to ""pass 100% to 100% of people"". A lot of people are too focused on themselves to care what's happening around them. I expect that you won't be confronted by strangers or anything (but I'm from Portland, and I haven't been out in a while).

I would say there's safety in numbers, just in case.
Good luck.

Not sure I would agree about not expecting to be confronted - my experience going out tells me the boys think anybody with long hair and boobs is fair game for flirting and general chatting up - be advised!
RIGHT!?  

People say ""not all men"" but like.. THEY DIDNT HAVE TO FOLLOW THESE RULES! ALL. MEN.

but my parents didnt let me. they told me if i did, theyd be taken away from me and put in jail. me, my therapist, and doctor have no idea where they got that idea from. though me and my therapist do suspect its them trying to keep police as far away as possible due to how theyve treated me and my siblings.

My first outing as myself!	"On Saturday I decided that I was fed up with waiting for lockdown to end, so I went on Facebook and bought a pair of sandals and a purse. My plan all week was to go out in public for the first time as a girl! I did a trial run under my baggy jeans while I picked up my items to test for any “wardrobe malfunctions” that might give away the most obvious AMAB feature. 

On Sunday morning I did my makeup, drank as little fluids as possible to keep my bladder as empty as possible for the day, and just went for it. I was so excited to get out the door I forgot my phone! After returning to grab it I headed down the backstreets to head for a quiet trail to snap some pics in nature. 

After I was done that I headed for the pot store but lost my nerve to go for the door because my voice is not at all feminine. Walking down one of the busiest streets in my city now, I began noticing men looking at me! When I looked in their direction they would look away like they weren’t checking me out, but they don’t realize how damn obvious it is. That honestly boosted my confidence to astronomical heights, knowing that I pass so convincingly that I actually had men staring at me! Being told online that I’m beautiful is one thing, but being seen and checked out by guys in real life is a whole other rush of excitement that I wasn’t expecting.

It was a hot day and I was getting very thirsty, so I went to McDonalds to grab a small drink, which I didn’t even finish because I was so scared to have to pee at any point. I took the bus downtown and would usually go right to the back of the bus, or even stand if it was half packed in case any women or elderly folks need to sit in the front, but today I was that woman so I took a seat near the front of the bus and sat pretty while I played on my phone like any other girl like me does. 

Realizing that my mask and the drink straw messed up my lipstick, I got off the bus and went straight for the nearest window at the bus depot downtown to check myself out and reapply some lip gloss. Now the part of the city I was in before has almost zero pedestrian traffic, but downtown is full of pedestrians all the time. With my rear facing out towards the sidewalk as I was looking at my reflection I noticed this man slow down and change the direction he was walking to come and tell me “nice pants”. I just grinned and got the f*ck out of there before any more men approached me. 

On my way to the Park I got a few honks because traffic is very slow downtown. I felt like everyone was looking at me at this point! Even women were looking at me but I didn’t notice until I got closer to the park where hundreds and hundreds of people were enjoying the sunshine and warm weather. I never had women just say hi out of nowhere to me, smile at me and wave just because... well, just because I guess! 

In boy mode I would stare at women and look for outfit ideas, but never too long because I never wanted to look like a pervert. But as a girl I could stare all day and when they noticed they all smiled back at me and even checked me out too! 

Then I had to pee. After knowing how well I pass I did not hesitate to go into the ladies washroom which was, to my surprise, ABSOLUTELY PACKED! I just stayed quiet, smiled, fixed my makeup in the mirror, and waited my turn. Two cute old ladies said “Miss, you can go ahead now. There’s a stall open.” Not a single girl in there looked at me funny! I fit right in! 

I began walking the whole park and enjoying myself. I felt so incredibly feminine and attractive! I began REALLY paying attention to the men at this point, men with their wives and kids were checking me out and they weren’t being smooth about it either. I felt so bad because I didn’t ask for this, their poor wives...

Leaving the park I realized that I got my first taste of “safety in numbers”. I began feeling very nervous walking back to the bus depot knowing that any man could just rape me if he wanted to. Or that if I coughed or sneezed people downtown would hear my male voice and begin harassing me. My city is not the most inclusive in Canada. There’s a lot of crime and drugs downtown. People get assaulted and robbed all the time. I could almost hear the insults like “faggot” and “tranny” coming my way if I let anybody find out I’m AMAB. 

At a crosswalk two vehicles rolled town their windows and the men waved at me and watched as I waited for my crossing signal. I just shyly waved and tried not to smile. One old man in a very expensive car singled with his hands “I’m going to turn around”. I ignored it and kept walking. He met me at the next crosswalk and introduced himself to me. I didn’t want to get him mad by ignoring him or insulting him, so when he asked for my name I said “I’m Summer.”

“Are you a man?” He asked, visibly shocked by my voice.

Without bothering to confuse the situation I just said “Yes” in hopes that he would leave me alone and he just chuckled and drove away. At the next crosswalk he actually came back and said “being with someone like you has always been a fantasy of mine, I was wondering if I could have your number?”

Before I could respond I pointed at the traffic light to show him it turned green, and just walked away glad that it was over. But further down the street I saw him pulled over waiting for me! “Summer! I was wondering is you could suck my c*ck.”

I have a newfound appreciation for how brave women are yesterday. Girls who are a lot more attractive than me. I could only imagine the type of things they have to put up with on a daily basis. My opinion on men has changed forever. They’re awful creatures.

I took the bus to go makeup shopping because I was excited to show the girls at the drug store what I’ve been doing with all the makeup they’ve been helping me pick out over the last few weeks, but none of them were on shift yesterday and I had to chat with a new girl who had so much to ask me about my makeup and style. We had a girly talk at the counter for like 10 minutes because it wasn’t very busy at all. She complimented me and kept everything very professional despite her obvious curiosity about my life. With a big bag of makeup I began heading home.

Now my high school sweetheart works at the pot shop close to my home, I wanted to surprise her with my new look but she wasn’t on shift either. There was two guys working there. One calls me “boss” and the other calls me “bro” on a normal day, and when they pulled up my account they were shocked that “Captain Kirk” from down the road was now a girl that they were checking out as I walked up!

I walked down the trail home and took more pics until my phone died. I got in the door and messaged my dad. Coming out to him and telling him all about my story, and showing him pictures from my day in the town. He was asleep and read them this morning, and good news! He’s super supportive and happy for me. Now all I need to do is come out publicly to my friends and then I’m fully out of the closet! Yayyy!!!

This coming month it will be my 27th birthday. I knew since I was 7 years old that my future was going to lead up to today. That would mark 20 years of hiding if I don’t come out to ever this month. It’s also Pride Month! My miserable life of hiding and being afraid is coming to an end soon. I have my family and that’s all that matters. I don’t care if I lose all of my friends now, I know I will attract better friends being myself.

Thank you for reading, and I love you!"	"That sounds like an amazing day minus the few things wish I could do that I know one day I’ll be able too
Yay and congrats!!!  Sounds like you had a very wonderful first time out and that you passed very well! The freedom to be able to walk out the door as your true self is mind-blowingly (yes that’s a word, I just made it up 😊) euphoric. Good on you for your courage too. Thank you for sharing your experience and best wishes for more similar experiences to come! 🌸🌈🙋🏻‍♀️"	nplhuo	trans	18	0.91	2021-06-01 04:17:47
Anyone Feel That In A Perfect World They May Be Happier Transitioning But Don’t Want To Give Up Their Cis(Presenting)-Privilege?	Like I don’t know I’m not extremely dysphoric. I just feel more comfortable in female spaces and feel that I’d probably make more sense many of the times are a woman. Growing up I often wished that I was female and still sometimes I do. I’m okay with the fact that I’m male, but I wouldn’t mind being female either. I’ve considered transitioning and have come to the conclusion that being black, my privilege is already pretty low in society. The idea that I’d have to give up most of my family and would have to feel unwelcome for uncomfortable in my conservative work environment and state that I live and would have to look over my shoulder for potential violence while moving around in public —especially since I’m black, because black trans women face violence as disproportionate rates — that I wouldn’t be able to travel safety in some countries, like if I decide to go to some countries in Africa, which has always been my dream —giving all of that up just doesn’t seem worth it to me. Is that wrong to feel?	"HAHAHAHA ohhhh boy this is extremely large brained. I didn’t even know this is how I felt, but yeah. I would compltetely agree with you
This is something that troubles me a lot, I'm still so deep in the closet only my wife knows. But if it was the **perfect™**world then there would be no privilege, instead there would be equality.
Black non-binary trans here . Yes this fear is valid and you aren’t crazy . I present publicly  but it can be scary. I say do it at least once because life’s short! I am constantly in this middle ground because I love presenting femm and hang on to my make privileges but being black in the south can make you feel “it’s not worth it” like you said. But I would never take back the days I was being myself ❤️
Oh baby. Yup. 

It’s probably one of the biggest hang ups I have about transitioning, and it’s compounded by the fact that I’m non binary. I want to be male-presenting about 75% of the time, but the remaining 25% I just... can’t give up. I’m thinking about how easy it is to attract positive attention when I look like a cis Asian woman. I’m thinking about how safe it is to travel as a cis woman with a male partner, than a transmasculine “male” with a male partner. I’m thinking about how I don’t have to take extra medicine or spend money for my body to fit my AGAB. I’m thinking about how good I look in a skintight dress and how I still want that sometimes, even when I’d rather wear a suit and look like a guy most of the time. 

It’s so confusing. My daily life right now, I’d be safe to transition in it. But I don’t know if things will change for me. Maybe I’ll want to live abroad again. Maybe I’ll want to move out of my liberal city and into the more conservative suburbs. 

I just don’t know.
I'm in a somewhat similar boat. I enjoy being a girl and experimenting with gender identity but I'm reluctant to take any steps that I can't reverse because being an outwardly cis person gives me more options
Yeah I agree 100%. I’m trying to get the courage to present as myself her soon for the first time in public. But it does mean leaving behind white male privilege to do so. I still need to be be, but knowing I benefit from it and willingly giving it up is hard. I’ll still have white privilege of course, so I can’t imagine how hard it is for you. But it’s definitely something that’s crossed my mind too
But also I feel like this is a problem with the conception of privilege. Having privilege is not a bad thing. It's called privilege because it's bad that not everyone has it. You have absolutely no obligation to make yourself suffer for the sake of some abstract metaphysical idea of social justice. The only thing that matters are the actual consequences of your actions"	l8mgd5	trans	18	0.91	2021-01-30 14:09:53
Passing.	"I want my trans siblings to know that passing is not the end-all-be-all goal of transitioning. It does not define your worth and it does not define your beauty. And also your beauty doesn't determine your worth either.

If you don't pass, you're valid and I love you. 

If you need to pass for safety or dysphoria reasons, that's valid too, but your ability to pass does not in any way limit your value or your desirability as a partner."	"I mean I pass and people still blatantly use the wrong pronouns when they find out I'm trans. It's dumb. Don't ever let anyone tell you they're going to ""struggle with your pronouns"" that's complete baloney. When I was not passing, many people around me used my correct pronouns without ever slipping up. I show no leniency to those who use the wrong pronouns. Unless they are a stranger who I will never see again. 

Edit I also don't care if you knew me before, you need to make an actual effort to use the correct pronouns. Before I even started my transition certain teachers and friends insisted on using my correct pronouns despite me telling them it was fine if they didn't.
Yeah that's hard-core bullshit. Don't you ever let up!
I find its my mom who has a hard time with pronouns...my dad simply doesnt use them when he can haha...
She's trying, but 32yrs of using male pronouns is a hard habit to break.
Not anything against your mom, but that is 100% her own stigma and issue. It has nothing to do with using male pronoums for that long, it is her that chooses to not make the change and see you as the woman you are. I had this convesation with my parents when they told me ""16 years of calling you male pronouns is hard to break"" and my response was, ""no, you are being stubborn,"" and they corrected it pretty quickly, save the occasional slip up. They would also joke about ""wow I mess up everyone's pronouns now,"" and I told them that was extremely inconsiderate and it made me feel horrible about myself, like it was a joke to them. The next morning they both messaged me and said, ""we're sorry, we should be taking your pronouns seriously, it was wrong of us to joke about them,"" 

It's not a habit, it's stubborness. No matter who it is or how they have known you, if they still want your love and respect, they better give you love and respect."	jagnq7	trans	17	1.0	2020-10-13 16:16:45
Looking for honest opinions and advice if I pass enough (body and outfit) to be able to go shopping at the mall. I live in the south so deeply concerned about safety before taking the plunge. Face hidden because no makeup and i need a fresh shaveand I dont want the face part to throw off opinions		"As far as body goes, I wouldn't question wether you were female or not if I saw you in public
I wish you nothing but the best and I hope that this isn’t considered bashing, because I want nothing but the best for the trans community, but I looked at your profile and your face will out you, honestly. Again, this isn’t malicious, but you told me to be honest and that you live in a potentially dangerous conservative area —otherwise I wouldn’t say anything. I live in a conservative area too, but honestly, this is America and you have just as much right to be here as anyone else, so maybe it’s worth a try to go out and screw the haters
Hi love, 
Sorry for my broken English :) 
I think your body does pass well. Your breast looks modest yet visible and to my opinion it gives you a natural look. As for the outfit, you have great legs so the skirt and the shoes looks good on you, but the top seems too tight and a bit short and that would be the detail that would catch my attention. I would rather go for a light and loose top with a wide neckline for an effortless and age appropriate look. Paired with a thin gold necklace maybe to compliment your skintone. It would still look sexy, but a little more chic. And your curves would still be visible as they would be suggested as you moove. 
Hope this help !
Thank you for the input. I feel my breast inserts are a little small proportionly to my chest and shoulders but I only have a one cup size up insert right now. I think bigger breast by 2 or 3 sizes would help. What do you think?
I dont find your comment rude or bashing in any way. I know there are features on my face that will give me away no matter how good my makeup skills get. I dont think estrogen would change some enough either. FFS would be my only option there.  My voice will also give me away. 

I was looking for more of opinion if I was walking through the mall would I be completely detechable or would would i pass to some extent.
Thanks and I appreciate the feedback and suggestions"	i97rc6	trans	17	0.89	2020-08-13 20:36:42
How to be an ALLY, written by a trans person	"I've had a lot of cis people ask me for advice when people they know come out as trans. Here are a few things you can do during pride month to treat your friend or new coworker with respect. Tl;dr: at the bottom


1. Person comes out as trans but doesn't offer a new name or hints they may want to change it.

Here's an example of something I have used with a friend of mine when she told me that she was using a gender neutral name around certain people. Of course I want to respect her so it's my responsibility to make sure I'm doing my part to make her feel safe.

""Would you still like me to continue to use [insert name here] to reflect your beautiful identity or would you prefer me to use something's different?"" is a phrase that honestly goes a long way for some people I know that have told me they wanted to use one name and then changed their mind later.

If they give you a new name but tell you that you can only use it when you're alone with them, take note. Do NOT out a trans person without their consent. Some trans people are stealth for certain reasons and you could be jeopardizing someone's safety.


2. If someone gives you more than one pronoun option, use all of them [unless otherwise specified]

A lot of people I know will use he/they but never get called they. Switch it up a bit! A little goes a long way.


3. Do *NOT* ask us what is in our pants. It's none of your business. We're you're friend or coworker. It's inappropriate and VERY offensive.


4. ""Oh you're trans? You don't *look trans*"" is NOT a compliment. Don't say it.

5. Don't post under trans people's transition photos that they looked better before or do a ""bi panic post"". Many of us don't want to hear that you would have been attracted to us either way and diminishes the fact we have tried so hard to do something important for ourselves mentally, physically and emotionally.


Alright, I can think of more things but I ran out of spoons. I'll probably add more later. Feel free to add tips for our allies below!


Tl;dr: DON'T BE A FUCKING ASSHOLE and happy pride month!"	Thanks! Really helped me. I have a firend that's theans so now i know what to say and what not to say to him.	o8f19u	trans	17	1.0	2021-06-26 17:21:17
Would it be cowardly to come out with a letter?	"I'm trying to come out to my family, but whenever I try my nerves get the best of me. I already came out to my mum and it went kinda not the best (she doesn't really get, is confused as to how I can ""really be a woman"", and is more concerned for my safety than happy for my euphoria. She's trying, but it's a work in progress). I feel like I would be able to get it all out better if I just wrote it down and left it for my dad to read/text it to my sister. It feels like the easier approach for me, but a part of my worries that this would just be a cowardly way to come out, and I can't quite shake the idea. Any input?"	"That's how I came out to my family. I wrote a long letter and emailed it to everyone. I suck at talking and it's much easier to express myself through writing when I can take the time to think and choose my words. So if writing a letter helps you express yourself better and helps you feel safer or more comfortable to come out, then do that. There's no right or wrong way to come out.
I don’t think so.  I told my dad about my name change in a letter.  I told my shrink that I did it so that ‘I won’t be responsible for his initial response’ and I think I was both correct and very forward thinking.  
Right?  
Bc, whatever their response is is their responsibility to manage.  They need to mull it over and feel their feelings and figure out how they want to respond.  Plus, you get the bonus of really getting to think about it, edit it, fashion the wording exactly the way you want and, if you desire, to *ask them to think before they respond*.  It puts a cushion around the whole thing for everybody.

Best of luck on your journey.
Yes, it can feel cowardly but work.

I came out to my family (didn't live in the same town) by writing a long letter to my mother. Once it was in the mail, and I was committed to the disclosure, I found the peace and strength to call her and talk to her before the letter arrived.

And the process of writing the letter helped me clarify for myself what I wanted them to know. I came out in the spirit of wanting to no longer hide, I was ready to accept any consequences.
I came out in a letter to my family not because I couldn’t speak to them, but because there were 2 major benefits:

1) It allowed me to say EXACTLY what I wanted to say without being sidetracked, nervous, interrupted or forgetting something 

And 

2) It gave my family space to process this information without me literally being in front of them. Perhaps they were shocked, perhaps sad, perhaps they already knew! Regardless, their initial emotional response is theirs - not mine - and I didn’t need to witness it.

I personally think letters are the best.
Make sure you're in an environment that will not lead to any major harm that may come ur way, I don't think it would be ""cowardly"" to write a letter. tell them however you want to and a way that makes u feel comfy slime 🌈❤️
I don't think so. I came out in a text to my daughter and her husband the Sunday after the night club massacre in Florida.A ketter us way better than a text me thinks 🤷‍♀️
No I don't think it's cowardly at all. A letter is how I came out. I wish I still had a copy for memories.
However you decide is the most comfortable way to tell people is how you should do it. Never feel pressured to do something you know feels wrong. ❤
If they are offended by the way you come out, that is their problem, okay?
I came out as queer to my family via a letter, then spent the night at my girlfriend’s place. What I would change about it is including that I didn’t want to talk about it. That led to issues for a long time. So I wouldn’t say that.

Decades later I told my sisters I’m trans over text; it wasn’t a surprise (they knew I’d been thinking about it). 

I don’t really frame a letter as cowardly, though I don’t think that “brave” is honestly all it’s cracked up to all the time, anyway.

This is self care. You’re respecting yourself and what you need. You need them to know. You need a way to keep your thoughts together and to make sure you said what you want to say.

It also gives them time to have an initial response. They don’t have to control their faces. They can be surprised or whatever without worrying they’re hurting you.

Be prepared for the time before their reaction. That wait can be hell.
I don't think that's wrong. It's a hard message to deliver, and there's often so much you want to say that unless you write it all down you're going to worry about forgetting something. And writing it down gives you the chance to say it the way you really want to say it, rather than fumbling through an ad-libbed coming out.
Writing a letter to your family is still brave. You are coming out, you are exposing your true self to people close to you. It is almost better to do it this way, they might complain or not agree, but this is about _you_. It gives you space to get out what you need to get out in words without being interrupted and in a format that lets you communicate better with more thought and purpose. It also gives them some space to read and react and process.

I have come out in person, over zoom, in a text message (i.e. ""btw, I'm trans"" - it was very situational) and via letter. I think the letters were the best, a close tie with zoom, but that was because it was with my sister and her husband. They knew about LGBTQ+ people and had gone to school and known transgender people.

I liked sending the letters and also including the American Psychological Association's pdf that is kind of a Transgender 101 for people - https://www.apa.org/topics/lgbtq/transgender.pdf
i came out with a letter. i recommend it, as it gives people time to process what you’ve said and can prevent the awkward silences
[removed]
You have no duty to come out to anyone at all, let alone in person. If writing a letter is how you feel most safe and comfortable then go for it! I say make it a fun little craft night for yourself to make it even less stressful. Get some stationary and stickers (whatever your aesthetic, super girly or neutral tones or whatever you think looks cool) and write a letter to each person you want to come out to.
i came out to everyone via facebook post so...a letter would probably be better than that at least? :P
not at all!! thats what i did and it made it a lot easier

Hello r/trans, please help educate me on gender dysphoria!	"I am a 22 year old queer female who believes in inner peace and resolution through gender identity. I’ve always seen my expression as more androgynous, though I’ve recently discovered the joys of feminine power through the gay, trans and drag community. The LGBTQ+ community has helped me discover aspects of my sexual orientation and better my relationship with my own gender identity. And for that, I’ve sworn to myself to always stand up for the safety to safety of other members of this vibrant community on all spectrum of the rainbow!

However, the recent discourse and subsequent hate aimed towards trans activist Dylan Mulvaney leaves me genuinely anxious about how transitioning women, and I realised that I know nothing about the anxiety, mental turmoil, and overall experience of gender dysphoria. 

Therefore, I am humbly asking you folks, the lovely beings of this community to educate me on your firsthand experience, the social, mental and physical, aspects on the dysphoria and how transitioning has both positively and negatively (if any) affected yourself in this journey of life.

All comments are welcome, and feel free to leave as little or as much detail as you’d like!"	"Start here: https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en
Imagine walking into the wrong classroom or hearing a recording of your own voice. 
That’s the feeling of living as my assigned gender at birth
I explain Gender Dysphoria like this:

Imagine you wake up in the opposite gender. You now have to go out into society and get dirty looks from the people who knew you when you were the opposite gender. You even get dirty looks from other people because they still see traits of your previous gender. AT some point, a feeling develops where you start to hate your new gender, you hate how it makes you different from everybody else, and how you get treated differently because of it.

Eventually it builds and builds until and causes emotional distress. The first things that cause this distress are the very things that keep you from being your true gender, like the pre-op chest on a trans man, or the genitals on a pre-op trans woman. Soon they narrow down to the nit-picky things that obviously differentiate a biological male from a biological female (examples: AMAB have stronger eyebrow bone lines, wider shoulders, AFAB have wider hips). Using myself as an example, I'm not super dysphoric about my penis, but the dysphoria I do have is painful because it means I'll never be a woman genetically, and be able to give birth or have a motherly connection to my future children. To me, a period is like a rite of womanhood, which feels invalidating as I am a woman. The best way I can describe my feelings about it all, is like a deep sinking feeling in my heart. This feeling never really goes away. On the best of days, I feel gender euphoria (like painting my nails, or getting complimented as a girl out in public), but on the worse days it's debilitating and leads to intrusive thoughts.

This is all before the media and transphobic people get to you, accusing you of being a pervert if you use the bathroom that is associated with your gender, or assuming that you a child groomer. It really causes dysphoria to become so much worse.
Being trans is different for everyone. The best way to get an understanding of a trans person , is to meet one . And then you’ll have an understanding of that one trans person. To understand us all, you’d have to meet us all. You’d see how different we are and how the only thing we have in common is the fact that we have some problem with our gender in relation to our sex. All of this stuff is confusing , and I don’t know it. All I can say is in my experience I enjoy living my life as a trans woman. My life is worth living now. I get called pretty and people are very nice to me. I have affirming people in my life. I am not hurting anyone or causing any conflict in my daily life with how I look and live. You’d have to meet me to understand
Hi. Your intentions may be good but running into a group and demanding emotional labor isn't.
For me it's just the body dysphoria, because gender identity is nothing more than the fitting between body and mind for me.
Like something is fundamentally wrong with your body, but people don't believe you.
I unfortunately can’t speak for the effects of transitioning, however the dysphoria I can definitely talk about, though it’s hard to explain but I’ll try my best.

Whenever I notice something that makes me feel dysphoric, such as my voice or my chest, I get this pit feeling in my gut and it just feels yucky. Sometimes it gets so bad that I just refuse to speak or look at myself because I just can’t stand it. When I’m deadnamed or misgendered, it just doesn’t really feel like the person is talking about me, more like just a shell of myself. My name particularly bothers me and always has, but that’s the part that gets abused the most as well.

I’m out to my family, I’ve told them my prefered name/pronouns but they’ve just refused to call me that basically saying that “because we’re your parents we’re the exception,” and they couldn’t be more wrong about that. They’re the ones I need the support from most and the fact that they aren’t providing that makes me more upset each day. More people need to understand that the more important they are to us, the less likely they’re “the exception.”

Of course there are good days and bad. I feel somewhat cursed and somewhat blessed to be trans. On one hand, I have to face discomfort and discrimination every day, even and especially in my own home. On the other hand, I have a wonderful community who will always be here who always support each other. I’m proud to be trans and a part of this beautiful community; not just the trans community, but the LGBTQ+ community as a whole. It’s as flawed as any other community, but it’s still full of amazing people, thank you all for being here!
I have to wake up everyday look in the mirror and see a body that will NEVER make my only dream come true. I’ve tried just living as my assigned gender at birth for a long time until i was able to pay for my bills and not need parental assistance. Growing up i didnt fit into the groups i was “supposed” to always felt out of place yet i liked and felt more similar to people of the opposite gender up until puberty and that is when my brain initially cracked bc i knew for the next 60-80 yrs of my life until i die my dream would never come true. So i would mask and pretend to be happy and lie when i would be asked if im ok. Well im done lying about being happy and now i just try and live out the rest of my life with knowing what i can change and just cry about what i cant. Adoption as a concept is helpful but its not as real for me you know? No one chooses how they are born so knowing that we shouldnt try to force people into doing things they dont like doing. Why should someone be forced to eat vanilla when they want chocolate ice cream and the reason being for them not are others that were born similarly enjoy vanilla instead so you MUST eat it same with clothes, hobbies, friend groups, etc etc etc. And it doesnf help when youre just trying to snjoy life when politicians are criminalizing you for wanting to stay alive even though society wants to make you their slave.
Thank you so so much!!! This genuinely helps, though I’ve gotta lot of reading to do :3

How important is it to tell my dentist that I am trans and pregnant?	" I (trans masc) haven’t been to the dentist in a while. A combination of lack of insurance (US) and money. Now I am pregnant and I don’t have places that I know are trans friendly. So I just made an appointment with the first place that had an opening. I am nervous about disclosing but it might be relevant for treatment and the safety little fetus. Any dentists or health professionals that know the answer?

Update: I had a great experience at the dentist! They were nice, I was so nervous and I wanted to work out mainly because I can walk to them. Obstetrician said that as long as they use extra protection for x-rays I should be fine but that in reality, it is overkill just to make sure everything is 100% safe. I got a toothache today and I am glad I had this ready. Thank you for your advice!"	"(not a medical professional) I'd assume anything that doesn't involve having to use a drug would be fine? Like a cleaning or regular appointment is probably fine, whereas something requiring painkillers should probably be disclosed
I’d mainly be concerned about X-ray.  Did a quick search and I’m seeing that the dentist will want to know that you’re pregnant prior to administering an x-ray.  

https://swfamilydentistry.com/im-pregnant-should-i-undergo-a-dental-x-ray/
Dental assistant here. As mentioned elsewhere, if you need x-rays or a CBCT scan, the protocol is probably to give pregnant patients additional protection (such as two lead aprons or a more robust one than they normally use). The radiation is in a fairly low dose, but I'm not qualified to just tell you not to worry about it. That being said, if you ask for additional protection without outing yourself, they'll likely just give it to you.
On top of what other people said you should also usually tell them if they plan to do an xray so they can properly shield the torso from exposure to radiation. I know sometimes they do imaging depending on what tooth problems you might have had in the past or if they discover certain issues, so be aware of that!
Thank you 🙏❤️
There's something I remember about Dental work causing a bacterial issue that's a big deal for pregnancies. Not sure tho. I would mention it. If their a medical professional, they should handle it professionally with no problems.
Well I don’t think your teeth or you being pregnant have anything to do with being trans…
Seconding this.

Painkillers, anesthesia, etc.

If somethings being consumed, the dentist should prolly be made aware.
This is superhelpful! Thank you!
Oh hon. Pregnancy can cause teeth decay, the obstetrician told me to go. I have to be careful with everything I put into my body because it can affect the fetus and my body reacts differently to medication and illness in this condition (I can't eat deli meats, soft non-pateurized cheeses, had to stop some medications, etc).

I miss being loudly queer (i.e. Trans and out on public)	I moved to a city that's more conservative than my hometown. I had so many queer friends and felt that I could be out and loud and happy about it, but now (mostly for safety/gossip reasons) I feel the need to hide my transness. It makes me yearn for the time in highschool/college where I felt the most proud of being queer. Now I just hold shame and secrets. Idk just a vent :(	"i understand that. sometimes i feel that way, but i have also learned to love my stealthness & the comfort i feel being perceived as cishet.

finding friends that know & love your queerness may help. being extra queer on the internet might help. or maybe you find that you don’t need to be as discreet as you think in your new city. i wish you luck!
I wish I could feel proud of being trans publically. My family, my extended family, my local friends are all transphobic. My state (Queensland in Australia) is easily the most transphobic state. It makes me feel so vulnerable and alone.

The only consolation is that I have friends in England that validate me. I was actually able to come out to them, and I feel they love me so much. A shame they live on the other side of the world, and that Covid has made travel absurdly difficult, but one day I will be able to travel and be around people that support me.
Get really buff so you can be loud about it and be able to defend yourself if need be
You know I have thought about that, but I'm also a pacifist and would much rather not deal with physical conflict. A wonderful fantasy though :)

Trans Geography	"A review of selected countries for livability for Trans people :) 🏳️‍⚧️

Canada- Easier access to medical care, far less transphobia, good hate speech and anti- discrimination laws. Just be warned that Quebec is not the safest province and like the US a right wing movement is occurring (although much smaller)

United States- The West Coast (Hawaii, California, Oregon, and Washington), Chicago, and the Northeast Corridor (D.C, Baltimore, Philadelphia, NYC, and Boston) are in the same boat as Canada. Colorado is mostly safe however, with recent tragedies be on guard there. The rest of the country can be dangerous and hard to live in especially in Texas due to extreme Alt- Right/ Facist beliefs there, causing laws that discriminate against us and make it much harder to get care. The US is especially dangerous for trans people who are also POC.

Mexico- Being an immigrant makes living here easier although prepare for microagressions as Trans issues are fairly ignored. If you are a native Mexican discrimination is much higher due to the high religiosity of the country. The main issue with Mexico is harder to access medical care (get around it by getting a perceptions and surgery in another country).

Brazil- With Bolsenaro out of office things will get better however, there is still lots of Trans discrimination in Brazil and good care can be infrequent and costly. 

South Africa- Best country in Africa to be Trans in however, discrimination is still frequent (especially outside of Cape Town).

Kenya- While it may be safe to visit as a Trans tourist living in Kenya is a different story. Trans people are feared, discriminated against, and ignored all together (think 1970s America)

Nigeria- DO NOT LIVE IN NIGERIA.  It is illegal to be transgender here, do not risk your life by moving here.

Spain- Easy access to care, anti- discrimination laws, and siestas. Spain is a fantastic place for trans people to live in as long as you can find a job.

Ireland- Same as Spain (minus siestas). 10/10 :)

United Kingdom- Put any plans on hold for now as in the short term transphobia is running rampant through the conservatives. The NHS is notorious for bad cate and jobs are nonexistent outside of London. My advice would be to wait until a Labour gov't improves things.

France- While Care and protection is guaranteed the French people are going through a transphobic phase (although not as extreme as Britian, America, and Italy).

Italy- Alt- Right ideas are taking the country be storm and any rights in Italy are being threatened. It would be smart to avoid this country (although Milan isn't bad).

Germany- Fantastic for any trans person. There could be snags getting Hormones but it is a little better than the US.

Scandinavian Countries- 11/10. No complaints from Norway, Denmark, and Sweden.

Hungary- LEAVE, like Britian is is best to wait until the political winds change as the fascist Orban turning the country over to Russia and coming after Queer people (especially Trans) hard.

Russia- Do not live in Russia. Although not illegal the discrimination, violence, and lack of any medical care makes it impossible for any form of healthy living especially after the invasion of Ukraine.

Turkiye (Turkey)- Things are getting worse (just like Eastern Europe) and safety is not guaranteed.

Israel- An Oasis for Trans peole in an area where although there is fantastic culture, food,  people, and architecture; the discrimination against trans and gay people is way to strong.  Israel is a good fit unless you are of the Islam faith where discrimination on religion occurs.

UAE- ILLEGAL TO BE TRANS. DO NOT LIVE OR TRAVEL HERE!

India- Trans Rights are growing in India although at present it is difficult to get care and discrimination still occurs (although mainly out of ignorance rather than hate like in Britian or America).

Japan- While Japan is a fantastic country and a world class tourist destination, living here as a trans person is especially hard due to the government ignoring trans (and gay) issues all together. Beacuse of this people are extremely ignorant here so don't count on getting HRT started from a Japanese doctor. 

Taiwan- Best in East Asia. Pride is celebrated here although most of it is focused on LGBA+ people and not trans people. However, people are getting informed and rights are expanding.

China- If you are an American citizen than forget about it as China and the US increasingly get at each other throat and it is unlikely you could get a Visa if you do not already have one. For other nationalities transphobia is all over as well as xenophobia so there is virtually no care for trans people and discrimination is very high.

Australia- Better than America but not as good as Canada. Still a great choice to live though (if you like spiders)

New Zealand- Same as Scandinavia 11/10. :)


As for me I am Trans femme and have been born, raised, and currently go to College in the United States however, in the red state of Indiana. I plan on leaving the US as soon as I graduate"	"In case you are wondering about traveling to these countries. 
Most of these countries are safe to visit except Nigeria, China, Russia, and the UAE. Be safe in the US as mass shootings are WAY to common. Also, it is preferred to travel as the Gender (which means boymoding for Trans Femmes, girl modding for Trans Mascs, and the same for Enbys) on your ID and passport, at least going though customs. :)
Be safe out there everyone ❤️ 

Also I know I've made a few spelling and grammar issues. I'm sorry 😔
I’ll add that Tucson, AZ is surprisingly LGBT friendly.  Also, that gender affirming care in the entire US is spotty.  Stick within 2 hours of a major city and be prepared to travel for good care.
There is a single, solitary up side to the US: is easy as fuck to get hrt in most places. Don't get sick or need any sort of medical care though 😂
New Zealand is pretty cool! i’ve barely encountered any transphobia here at all! there is a bit of a waiting list for hrt and surgeries, but i’ll be able to get it next year!
I'd be careful about Sweden. Far right is gaining traction there, especially among young people which is a bad omen long term.

Came out to my parents + bro	"Came out to my bro and parents cuz I was super depressed after what happened with old friend and I wanted to let them know for safety reasons. 

Ended up being on a current friend’s bday. I came out to my family with my partner present for support and I let them know via a Minecraft world I made for the occasion. It went well :-)"	"Congrats fren! Welcome to the family 💖 make sure to take care of yourself!
Thank you! It’s been a slow recovery, especially since I’m still learning to cope healthily. It’s a little awkward having parents know now (just explaining shit I guess) but my fiancé’s got my back 100%. He brings a smile to my face just thinking about him ❤️

Sorry for the ramble 😅 happy to have you guys here! Like I’ve said in previous posts, I’ve never felt like I’ve had to prove anything to you guys. You make me comfortable to explore myself without being put in a box right away. 

Stay safe, and have a lovely day ❤️
Oof I remember the 3 years of explaining I had to do for my parents cause they were worried they did something wrong 😭 So happy to hear your fiancé's got your back 💖 you too love! ❤️
Aah I felt that way with old friend. I got the impression she felt betrayed cuz I was trans. Kept saying stuff like “I’ve known you so long, it feels forced/fake”. Like being trans is a death wish or something 🤷‍♂️

I hope your parents are more supportive now. I know I’m just an internet rando, but you have my support as well.  Take it easy ❤️
That's awful :( and yeah parents are 100% accepting! They just wanted to make sure I was going to be happy, so once I showed them that they backed off lol"	vlj25m	trans	15	0.94	2022-06-27 00:58:19
"[possible TW] Congress about to pass KOSA bill censoring everything LGBT online under the guise of ""saving the children""."	"[link to article](https://www.vice.com/en/article/g5v9b7/lgbtq-youth-are-under-attack-why-are-democrats-pushing-a-bill-that-hurts-them-even-more)

possible trigger warning for mentions of hate speech

long story short, like anyone claiming they are ""saving the children"", this bill has such more insidious intent. That's why the leading democrat on it is working with [known transphobe marsha blackburn](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/10/21/u-s-sen-marsha-blackburn-headlines-anti-transgender-rally-in-nashville/). that's why the heritage foundation stated [they will use KOSA to censor](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans) twitter, tumblr, tiktok, wattpad, youtube, practically everything. earlier this month, 90+ human rights orgs, lgbt, and tech orgs [signed onto a letter](https://cdt.org/insights/coalition-letter-on-privacy-and-free-expression-threats-in-kids-online-safety-act/) calling on senators to oppose this bill. in retaliation, 230+ health and ""for the children"" orgs [signed onto a letter](https://twitter.com/APA/status/1602392617282568206) urging senators to pass it. they include groups like NCOSE (formerly known as morality in media, that rebranded as an ""anti-sex trafficking"" organization but still holds the same far-right christian fundamentalist leaders, connections, and goal: to eradicate all LGBT content from existence). senators are more inclined to push for this bill because APA is saying it will help kids when it will simply not. they have ignored the LGBT voices overwhelmingly and are only listening to the positive PR

**KOSA will lead to mass censorship and surveillance online of anything the Right doesn't like, because the way it works is that it gives every state attorney general full authority to sue any platform for having anything ""harmful to minors"". you see what is going to happen, yes? (which is why 90+ human rights, lgbt, and tech orgs told the senate not to).** 

the bill has so much positive PR. so so much that it keeps me up at night. we have to fight back, there is no other option if we don't want to get censored out of existence online. the best way to fight back is to CALL YOUR SENATORS and tell them to not put this in the end of year spending bill. 

**Call Chuck Schumer (202) 224-6542**  
**Call Maria Cantwell (202) 224-3441**

**if you need a call script,** [**use this**](https://linktr.ee/stopkosa)**.** there are also petitions and letters you can sign in that same link that take less than 1 minute"	"This is very reminiscent of Russia's anti-gay ""propaganda"" law.
What's further disturbing is how based on a cursory glance and research, there is at LEAST 10 organizations with fundamentalist/anti-LGBT ties:

Global Hope 365

Save Our Children (supported Anita Bryant, known anti LGBT crusader back in the 80s and 90s)

    NCOSE
    
    Lynn's Warriors
    
    Reflective Spaces Ministry, Corp
    
    Protect Young Eyes
    
    worthy2
    
    We Stand Guard LLC
    
    Traffick911 (reblogged pro-EARN IT)
    
    Resiliency Foundation

Those have ties to anti-LGBT groups, are following anti-Trans people/senators or ARE anti-LGBT like Exodus Cry.

[OH, and Lynn's Warriors are known to have forged a letter from Chuck Schumer for the Earn It Act in the past, so their credibility is already pretty suspect.](https://imgur.com/a/nhzUAgP)

Wealth Management Ministries hasn't updated their Facebook since 2018, and website looks dated, so possibly just a name to pad things out.

Realized Potential Inc hasn't been active since 2019.

I can't find any proof of Porn Free Colorado existing.

While there are far too many legit groups in the letter, the fact that there are so many shady groups or ones that haven't been active/don't exist for YEARS puts the credibility of this into question.
The right always says their freedom of speech is being limited when people call them on their shit, but here they’re actually trying to remove our right to publicly acknowledge our existence
Does anyone know how likely this crazyness is to actually pass and become law?
it would work the exact same way too, by eventually having everything get censored.
Yup. Which is why we have to fight back . the best way to prevent this bill is to call
It is very very very likely but we have to blow up those senators phone's NOW

"I wrote a letter to an RA about her bathroom policy (what do ya'll think?"""	"I frequent my best friend's (they/them genderqueer afab) dorm floor often, since I only live two floors down, so naturally I use the restroom on their floor. It's a women's floor. The RA (basically the student assistant who monitors the floor) saw me exiting the bathroom and stopped in her tracks. She told me she's seen me in there a lot and I'm not allowed to be in there. She said only residents can use the restroom. This is not a building rule. I don't know of any other floors that have the rule.  She also mentioned how a second friend (they/them enby/trans woman amab) used the shower one time which is ""against the rules"".

To be frank, she pissed me off. It happened over 24 hours ago and I'm still pissed. So I wrote this letter and slid it under her door.

There's more context in the letter:  
\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_\_

Dear ((RA's name)),

I apologize for using the 17th floor restroom. I was not aware you had a policy for restroom users. Of course I will honor your wish, as it is your floor's bathroom and not mine. However, I would like to explain a few things and hopefully clear up any misunderstandings.

I live on the 15th floor, a woman's floor, as I said before. I usually use the men's bathroom in public, but I am a transgender man, so I feel safer showering in a women's room in case anyone sees me naked. Using the 17th restroom is also much more convenient than going downstairs to use the restroom. I have never had a problem with my RA or any female residents on my floor, and I frequently see ((the Community Mentor, aka her boss)) in your restroom and she is always friendly and has never told me to leave. You said only residents can use the bathroom, but if that were the case, guests would have to go all the way to the lobby, which doesn't seem realistic. I'm assuming you really meant that only women can use the restroom. In that case, my friend ((the best friend/ the resident of the floor)) would not be able to use the restroom since they are genderqueer, not a woman. If it were based on having female anatomy, then I would be allowed to use your restroom. You see my point?

Further, the person you mentioned who showered in your restroom (tall with blue hair) is a trans woman. She dresses in masculine clothes as a safety precaution. She was spending the night at ((the best friend/ the resident))'s dorm and had nowhere else to shower. She has never caused issues in the restroom or purposely disturbed residents. While she could have gone to the 16th floor ((a men's floor)) to shower, it would have been quite humiliating for her.

I completely understand that you saw me and her and assumed the worst. I assure you, our friend would not have given us the bathroom code if we were potential threats to the 17th floor residents. (My floor also uses the same code.)

I don't mean to write this as an argument; I was genuinely shocked and upset and simply wish to explain myself. I come from a queer background. I don't believe in bathrooms separated by sex, especially given the unique gender identities of myself and my friends. I believe separating sexes by bathrooms is part of the problem. It creates a social divide between sexes. But like I said, I understand that for the majority of society, cisgender/passing men are much more likely to sexually harass women, so your concern for the safety of your residents is valid and I will respect your space. Maybe someday, men will learn to respect women's bodies, and we will not have a reason for bathrooms to be separated by sex.

I hope to have sufficiently explained my side of the situation. If you are unclear on any of my points, or if you would like to talk more about transgender bathroom rules, ways to be conscious of transgender guests/residents, or any related topics, don't hesitate to text me.

Thank you for reading and best wishes,

((My name and phone number))

It definitely could have been better, but I was writing on paper and I didn't want to write it all again.

What do you think? Did I do an alright job? It made me feel better at least."	"I wanna know what her response is. I'm willing to bet it's not good, if she even bothers.
I really think split bathrooms is a useless concept. All removal of clothing is in the privacy of a stall, and the rest of the bathroom exists to clean your hands. In the modern day, there's no good reason to have them separate. Not only is the split useless, but it's harmful. The question of trans bathroom choice (in the minds of trans people, governments have no say), if one bathroom is full and one is empty there's no way to alleviate traffic, it reinforces some unbreakable wall between the genders, and so on.

Hope this gives you some ammunition for future bathroom conversations.

Semi colon instead of first period, love! It will make your first sentence reflect your intent and be more impactful (instead of two separate sentences that do not do enough on their own).

I don't know if I should change my name on my ride share apps or not	Pic is usually what I look like driving, as I don't yet have the confidence to go out all day and end up God knows how far from home with makeup on and the like. I driver for Uber, Lyft, DoorDash etc. You have to call them to get them to update your name. (It apparently doesn't have to be your legal name the customer actually sees on their end, you can set a nickname.) A lot of times when someone gets in, they will ask for my name to confirm, or tell me what my name showed up as and ask me to confirm. It causes a lot of dysphoria a lot of the time, I want nothing more than to change it, and only hear my chosen name. But I am worried about safety. I have my nails done and these are ladies sunglasses, so I think some people might probably already 'suspect' *something*, but still. What would you do if you were me? My chosen name is Victoria or Tory, and I'm most often driving in the DFW area, but usually closer to Dallas than Fort Worth.		11uvm1n	trans	16	0.89	2023-03-18 18:15:42
Being trans in The Netherlands (as a foreigner)?	"Hello!

In a few months I'm going to start my first year at university abroad in The Netherlands. I am a coward, however, and would like to ask here if anyone could tell me what it's like to be trans in The Netherlands, in regards to safety and acceptation and the likes. Apart from that, I'll also need to find a GP there (for matters of health insurance) and I wondered whether there is some kind of database online with trans-friendly healthcare providers like the one we have in Belgium or not.

so done with it	ever since i started questioning in december i’ve been going through phases of feeling either euphoric about finally cracking my egg and then wishing it never did and today unfortunately is the latter… i wish i could just be a happy cis dude but that’s so far from who i am and it’s like uuuufgfgfhhh why does the world have to make it so hard to be trans i wish being trans was as mundane as brushing your teeth because rn my biggest concerns are worries about my own safety post-starting hrt and family members disowning me rather than my own imposter syndrome. i apologize for rambling on somewhat in circles… being trans is just already such a difficult experience. i think i’m just overwhelmed by all the external pressures	"Hun, I get where you're coming from, but don't let this feeling best you! You know what makes you happy, so take each step slowly. You'll make it there.
ive heard the saying ""cracking my egg"" a lot what does it mean?
i hope so, i’ll admit these backward flows of thoughts have been coming back less and less so i’m hoping that keeps up
it’s sort of a euphemism for coming out except it’s specific to the trans community. basically, all of us are an egg, and the egg cracks when the person realizes they’re trans - so cracking the egg, parallel to coming out, is different in that it requires you to have the epiphany that you are in fact trans 🏳️‍⚧️"	ubzshs	trans	14	0.94	2022-04-26 00:26:45

I go outside everyday, not knowing if I'll even be able to get back home without being fucking murdered. This isn't the type of shit that should be happening in fucking 2023, we should be advancing as a society, not going back. I'M 15 AND I HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT BEING MURDERED IF I EVEN DARE TO SHOW MY FACE IN PUBLIC! IS THIS WHAT THOSE DUMB FUCKING CONSERVATIVES WANT? DO THEY JUST WANT EVERYONE THAT EVEN SLIGHTLY DISAGREES WITH THEM DEAD? I'm fucking done. This shit just keeps bugging me so fucking much.	"Learn how to fight. Both physically and politically. Involve yourself in politics. Bring in candidates who support you. Start at school councils, school boards of education, and townships. 
  
In the meantime you must learn to defend yourself physically. We're quite literally getting murdered in the streets. It is horrifying and stifling. Never give up. Never give in. Find allies near you so you can protect each other.  
  
If you're white and look like a guy, utilize your privilege and have police protect you. Get in good standing with your local police officers. 
  
Good luck.

Wtf with murdering trans people in USA? Is that common?
It's surprisingly common. There's a 10 stage system for genocide, and trans people are already starting to approach the 9th stage.

How do I reassure my parents?	"I (male, 27) started wearing ""women's clothes"" and make-up a few months ago and as a general rule, my parents are okay with it. I even got lots of gifts regarding this ""subject"" for my birthday yesterday. But I has come to my attention, they that - especially my mother - are concerned for my safety. Is there anything I can do to calm them down?"	"What are they specifically concerned about safety-wise?
Any kind of fear usually comes from the unknown. Of course, any parent fears for their child’s safety. That happens every day... and when you throw in this extra layer, it throws a little gas in the fire. 

Transphobia and homophobia are real official concerns. I’d guess the only thing you can do is talk about it with her. I mean, I don’t think looking up crime rates of gay/trans bashing will help relieve her fear, so all you can really do is thank her for her concern and support and realize it’s a pretty cool problem to have a mom that cares and is worried for your safety. If nothing else, buy her some flowers and thank her for that. 

As far as hormones, maybe you can look up info about that, or y’all look it up together. Regardless, if his isn’t a light switch thing. It’s part of the process. You’ll always be her baby, which is code for she’ll always worry for your well-being. Include her (and your dad too) in the journey. You’ll grow and develop together.
Mine were the same, there just concerned cause they care and honestly there’s not much to do to reassure them besides telling them you know what has happened to other trans people regarding attacks and murders along with knowing the side affects risks regarding infertility and breast cancer and that you will try to be safe. Mine were mostly reassured when I let them know this is what I want and anything bad that can happen from it is worth it.
I can't say for sure, but my best guess would be transphobia and the ""side effects"", because in my country this kind of thing isn't as accepted as I should be and sometimes even treated as a ""freak show"", for lack of a better term.
I don't know exactly how to deal with this type of thing, but if the ""side effects"" are what I think you're referring to generally having a support network and a supportive household should kind of prevent it from going that far. You may experience stuff outside of the house but I'm not sure how to deal with that.

Jealousy	My friend is consulting with his doctor about starting T on the 17th. I’m so unbelievably happy for him, but I can’t help but feel a little jealous. Maybe I’m wrong for that, but it just sounds so nice to have an accepting family and be able to be out and start transitioning without having to worry about your safety. But good for him and I’m wishing him the best. He deserves it because he’s been through his own struggles and made it a long way.	It's normal to feel jealous of people who are ahead of you in their transition. I think everybody feels this way at times. It's not wrong to be jealous because not being able to transition really sucks and it can be really hard to contend with.	pewz1x	trans	13	0.93	2021-08-31 02:34:13
Feeling wasteful as a male and want to be treated like a woman (20M)	" Starting off, I'm a 20M Asian gay guy who I can self-describe myself as softly effeminate, reserved and soft-spoken. Recently, I've been having growing feelings of the desire for people, mainly guys, to treat me as a straight female. The best I could explain it is with how some women wanting to be treated by their male friends like fellow 'bros' or 'homies', it's a reverse sentiment for myself, wanting my male friends and also guys in general to see me as a woman.

As a guy, I never hold many traits that I could consider masculine (never associating myself with bromance) and I feel more comfortable being in touch with traits considered feminine. For one, I crave deep-rooted intimacy with my male friends (unlike most guys) and am extremely affectionate with guys in general (when receptive or asked). I'm very open-minded when it comes to any intimacy... putting my head on a guy's chest, playing with his chest hair and listening to his heartbeat and deep breathing, being kissed on my forehead from time to time, sitting on a guy's lap to holding hands whether we're just friends or much more.

I feel like I want to be nurturing, supportive... loving. I just don't feel appreciated as a male to be in that role and I feel if I was a female, I would be treated differently and the fact is, I want to. My guy friends wouldn't have to be so emotionally distant, and I feel like they would do better in opening up to me through our friendships if that was the case. I desire guys whom I can completely trust without hesitation and be nurturing to them, to make them feel all gooey on the inside. In return, the safety, feeling of being protected and I matter to a guy is something I deeply crave.

On the sexual side of things, I find that if a guy wanted to make me or treat me as a woman, and if he would ask if it's alright if he made me wear some lingerie to make me feel feminine, exposed, make me more beautiful... I'd would like that very much. I've started to nurture my female persona by giving it a name... Cassie. I would gradually become more self-aware in my mannerisms, subtly changing them to be more feminine (e.g. waving my hands more when I'm explaining things, sitting in lady-like positions with knees closed and ankles crossed)

Most nights, I would read cheesy erotic fiction/romance stories where I would imagine myself more and more in the character of being feminine, trans/cross-dressers, wanting to escape in the fantasy of being a loving gf, and a wife... with a manly husband I'd want to wash over me with his tide of testosterone but holding a gentle and caring heart to take care of me and nurture me too. Sometimes, I would cry myself to sleep hoping it would be true in my life.

Growing up in a conservative household, my parents haven't been the most emotionally nurturing or supporting parents. In the past, my relationship between them has been heavily strained and to this day, I still don't trust them or haven't completely forgiven them for the past hurt they've placed on me. I don't think I ever will. It's not something I like to talk about in great detail.

I feel like my male friends wouldn't understand or be open-minded to what I'm feeling right now, and all I want is for a guy who can do so and won't reserve no judgment, but I want to take a step and trust at least one. I'm getting in touch with one of my guy friends soon and thinking it would be best to come out to him but I don't know how would I express it, I don't think I'm even trans enough but I would like it if people would refer to me with female pronouns and calling me by my female name, even if it meant I'm not strictly going through MtF, SRS or HRT any time soon. If it gets to that stage, then it shall be but for now, I want to take baby steps and be comfortable where I want to be. Any thoughts?"	"[𒀭𓆏𒀭](https://i.4cdn.org/pol/1573959144406.png)

Looking for advice on relocating to a safer state.	"Hello folks,  


Like many here, my partner and I find ourselves in a difficult situation: We live in a deep red state and it's clearly becoming more dangerous by the day to call it home. It's time to GTFO for our safety and sanity.  


I'm especially interested in advice on finding LGBTQ+ friendly employment or job placement agencies that are used to working with the community. We have out of state friends that are willing to give us a place to stay, but putting that kind of burden on them without having *some* kind of work options lined up hurts my soul. They're *amazing* people, but covering for two extra adults and their pets for an indeterminate amount of time is a huge ask, especially when I'm still in the transition phase and we don't have any savings to speak of.  


If you've been through something similar and have guidance or suggestions I'd really appreciate it. Thank you in advance."	"In a friendly state, any nonreligious university would be a great employer. As academia, they are almost always extremely friendly to LGBTQ+ people.  They have all kinds of positions too; larger ones are like a city unto themselves.
Would it be possible for either of you to find remote work in your industries? That would allow you to have some income while you transition to the new state.
I live in Washington State. There is a lot of acceptance for trans folks here. Health insurance is required to cover most of our care, including hair removal. There is still hate here, just like everywhere else, but it’s not anywhere near as bad as the red states. 

There are a lot of us here, with a lot of supportive allies. 

I hope you find a safer place to live, and I’m so sorry that you feel unsafe in your current community.
That's really good to know, thank you!
Possibly; we both have prior experience in customer and tech support. It's been a while since we worked in those fields, but we'll take what we can get. Thanks for the suggestion!
Thank you! Washington state has been on our short-list of destinations for a while and hearing that just makes it all the more appealing."	11q31n3	trans	12	0.84	2023-03-13 07:24:23
On passing (and not passing), and how trans people are complimented.	"I've seen this a lot, and in no way do I mean to shit on the desire to pass. I have it, and I assume that the majority of us do. For many of us it's also a safety thing. But: 
I don't think ""you pass"" should be used as the default compliment. I don't think we, as trans people, should measure our worth on whether we look cis (tbh measuring worth by looks is unhealthy whether you're trans or not). And I also don't think the epitome of trans beauty is to look cis.
I've seen hot trans people who don't look cis. And I've seen ugly cis people who look cis.

Trans people can be hot and sexy and handsome and beautiful, even when we don't pass. 

Trans people are valuable, whether we pass or not. We have inherent worth as people, no matter how we look."	I agree 100%. I’d also like to add as a transfem enby there really is no definition of “passing” for me personally. One of the biggest steps I’ve taken in self acceptance is internalizing the idea that trans people showing up as themselves is in itself beautiful, no matter if they fit some societal standard of “looking cis”. The desire to pass is completely valid, but I personally don’t want to look cis. I like embracing femininity, but being called a woman still gives me dysphoria (albeit not nearly as much as my AGAB), so being told I pass as a compliment is a mixed bag of emotions for me because on one hand they are not seeing me as my AGAB but one the other they still aren’t seeing me for who I really am.	m6x315	trans	12	0.94	2021-03-17 10:07:31
Family member has just showed a hint of falling down the terf pipeline, i need some links and info to stop it	so a family member of mine sent me a very disappointing text today saying that they “support trans people but just think “”men”” shouldn’t be allowed in womens bathrooms and shouldn’t compete in womens sports yada yada yada” the same old shit we’ve all heard. they have JUST dipped their toes into this kind of thinking so i really think theres hope to turn them around. theyre coming from the angle of worrying about “men being stronger than women so they could hurt them” and stuff and worrying about “women’s safety” (basically falling for terf propaganda.) i feel like i spiritually and emotionally may not have enough energy right now to 100% explain all this to them myself, though i will try, i would like some nice videos, reading or links that tackle these points and show that trans paranoia is not valid. i would love to get some great stuff from the community if you have it.	"Point out that there have been more senators who have gotten in trouble for lude acts in bathrooms then trans people, and noone is saying they can't go in bathrooms.
A cis woman posted on here yesterday in support of us and telling us how she had been harassed for using the women's restroom because she didn't look feminine enough and was assumed to be trans. 

Ask her if she thinks cis women suffering collateral damage because of bigotry is acceptable.

Any advice for a genderfluid kid going back to school?	"I recently came out as genderfluid and had my name changed in my school register. I’m also planning on getting my hair cut as soon as hairdressers are open (I live in the UK so we are currently in lockdown). 

I’m kind of scared because my school is absolutely filled with transphobic and homophobic kids. I know I’m going to get asked questions and made fun of. Best case scenario, people just brush off the name change and my friends don’t out me, but the likelihood is that it will be revealed to the rest of the school pretty quickly. I’m really scared that I’ll get bullied.

I’m planning on just politely correcting people when I hear my deadname and hoping they won’t connect the dots (name change + haircut + suspiciously flatter chest from a binder) but what should I do if people directly ask me? They’ll probably suspect that I’m trans even if no one outs me.

I can’t just stay with my queer friends for safety all the time as we have different classes.

Changing schools isn’t an option, and I wouldn’t want to anyway because of my friends.

Any advice for coping with bullying, deadnaming (I know many people will refuse to use my new name) and invasive questions? School is getting closer and closer and this just makes me dread it even more than I already did."	"You have to be honest. If they get mean, then leave, if they support you, then that’s good. If you’re never honest, then you won’t get anywhere in life.
Congrats on taking these steps! I wish you all the luck as you navigate what I’m sure is a challenging and complicated transition back to school.

The thing about bullying is, you can’t control other people. They’re going to do what they’re going to do. What you can control is what you do about it. I’d work on building self-esteem (so you are able to love yourself, and arm yourself against what the world throws at you), journaling, making time with friends who support you, etc. I’d also see if you can set up regular counseling, either through your school or through your insurance if your school counselor isn’t trans-positive or isn’t very helpful. It’s helpful to have someone to talk out these things with even before they happen. 

Also, I suggest keeping records of anything that you might need to bring to administration later.

I’m sure you know this, but you are a fantastic human, and anyone who doesn’t accept that or affirm that needs to work on themselves.
[removed]
I’m not gonna lie, this isn’t very helpful? I can’t just leave school.
Aw, thanks a lot, this helped. I’m going to mainly try to stick with my LGBT friends whenever I get the chance, and will probably try to build self esteem and learn to defend myself or deal with bullying when I’m not with them.
the fuck
Please stop :(
I did not say leave school. I was saying to leave your group of friends. Administration and fuck themselves. Make sure you secretly AUDIO record them. (People always act different in front of a camera, but not in a “music studio” aka, just record with your microphone)
Oh hey
[removed]
Yeah recording is probably a good idea. But I’m not leaving my friends - they’re not the issue here. My friends are very accepting and I love them
I just am. I didn’t choose this. I wish I were cis.
Ok and recording is a good idea.

please be kind to your own journey	"my experience pre hrt was probably similar to a lot of other trans people of all ages. I read a lot about the changes you'd go through, how your body would react and mould itself around this new thing. all of the mental, emotional impacts that came along with any physical growths. I wouldn't say it became obsessive, but there was certainly this level of anxiety surrounding what hrt could do for you. dealing with your thoughts and feelings regarding the many other transitions you find online and coming to terms with what they mean compared to your own perceived future journey. I struggled to be kind to myself even at the age of 21, thinking nothing would be the same as those starting in their teen years or those who were just naturally gifted with desirable features for their respective genders. of course admitting to envy wasn't a bad thing, rather it helped me understand where that jealousy came from, my own reconciliation with beauty standards, with cisnormative ideals, with what passing means in regard to safety and less stress. 

but coming into the 10th month of my hrt and having seen the growing changes in my body and mind, you realise that a lot of that energy placed into comparing and expecting your journey to work one way is fruitless. it's not wasted, because those anxieties have very real reasons to exist. but you begin to see that appreciating what your experience with hrt is giving is the positive growth you sought after for so long. sure I may not have the thinnest waist, but I can tell how my hips have grown and will continue to do so. yes, my shoulders are a major source of dysphoria, but it honestly matches up to my thick thighs. for me, being trans has always meant a tireless self-judgement of my ability to be accepted and fit in with what I expect to see with others of my gender. but that doesn't leave room to love yourself for all the unique ways that your own body and mind have flourished with whatever place you are at in your journey. it doesn't give room to see all the potential for things in the future that will grow out of the many positives of you. dysphoria and impatience with your journey is hard to deal with, but also remember that it'll be you. it'll be unique. it'll lead to things you didn't expect for yourself that will only bring happiness."

Coming out regret	"First post, not sure where else to talk about this so here ya go. 

I've been dealing with some major reconsidering lately when it comes to being trans (16, FtM). I've known I'm genderqueer of some sort since around middle school but tried to just repress it, but eventually everything became to overwhelming and I finally just accepted the fact that I'm a boy. Around freshman year (i think?) I came out to some internet friends and started exclusively going by he/him online, and while I've never once regretted that or felt uncomfortable, I'm getting mixed feeling about being out IRL. 

Coming out to my school friends wasn't really that difficult since basically none of us are cishet in any way, but my reaction isn't nearly as euphoric as I expected. It's a lot better than the constant misgendering and everything, don't get me wrong, but there are a lot of times where I feel very alone. I miss the safety of being closeted, and I hate how it feels like everyone around me is just ""tricking"" themselves into thinking of me as a guy rather than just actually seeing me as one. Then I came out to my managers, too, and while most of them are incredibly supportive, I still get the same awful feeling in the pit of my stomach. Constant reminders that I'll never be seen as a cis guy, or some degree of doubt in my identity.

I came out to my mother two years ago now, too (I live with her and her husband/my stepdad). Texted her about it and we later talked about it. It's kinda funny cause her first response over text was ""you know i'll always support you, just don't turn into a junky"", but when we finally talked she basically completely shut me down and said I shouldn't be putting myself in a box. Now she just acts like the whole thing never happened, she probably just thinks I'm a confused butch lesbian at this point, idk. I've considered talking to her about it again or telling my stepdad, but with the way that coming out IRL has left me in the past/present, I'm really not sure anymore.

I still feel immense dysphoria every single time I use the bathroom, change clothes, catch myself crossing my legs, talk or sing, get misgendered, or have straight guys hitting on me. I still don't identify with being a girl or woman or lady or miss or anything in that realm. But I miss the safety of it so much, I miss when I wasn't constantly fighting to get people to see me for who I am, I miss being closeted. I'm an extremely anxious person that can't handle any kind of change. I nearly had a breakdown when we ran out of the cereal I always eat for breakfast, how the hell am I supposed to make it through a whole transition?

Initially I was writing this to get opinions on whether me transitioning is a mistake or not, but I'm pretty sure I just answered my own question. Just curious now if anyone else relates or has found any form of coping mechanism for this. I know part of it is just learning to accept the fact that you'll never be a cis man, but that's a hell of a journey itself.

TL;DR: loser boy misses being closeted and doesn't know how to deal with change while socially transitioning"	"i relate to this a lot. i'm also ftm and i know that nothing i do will make anyone see me as a guy before i go on T. i miss the freedom of being closeted, i miss going swimming, i miss being able to buy clothes without wanting to cry. i even tried going back into the closet, but the feeling of 'this is wrong. this is wrong. this is wrong.' just kept building up until i just was like 'oh for god's sake, fine. here we go again' and came out for the second time. difference is, this time i'm not trying so hard to pass because i know it won't work and it's just a lot of effort. hopefully T will change everything, and i'll be able to live (almost) as freely as when i was closeted. sorry for the rant, but yeah, i feel the exact same way as you do.
I sadly have no advice, I'm not experienced enough to offer anything helpful. But you have my encouragement. You are a brave, strong, incredible young man. You will only grow stronger no matter the hardships that come your way. You are supported, you are valid, and you are completely amazing. I wish I had more to offer than support, but I know that you can handle this change of having come out with strength and dignity, and hopefully someone with better wisdom than me will have something more helpful to say. But know that you aren't alone, that you have the moral support of the community.

For what it is worth, I doubt that your friends are just amusing you. You seem too smart and kind to gather shallow friends like that. Have more confidence in them, and yourself.
I can't say better than the previous comment but don't worry things will be better, you don't have to be a cis man to be a man and I wish you to have less dysphoria and a beautiful day
Nah don't say sorry, I hear you man, it's nice to see other people have the same thoughts. Change of any kind can be pretty daunting, but I'm sure we'll get through it alright. I'm basically just waiting for when I turn 18 and can finally get on track to go on T too. Here's to hoping lol
Thank you, I seriously appreciate it! I think I do just need to spend more time in trans communities, cause this alone really did help. With all the transphobic/terf rhetoric in the mainstream media and just day-to-day bullshit it can be pretty easy to fall into a slump. Thank you again for the kind words.
Thank you sm :)
The news/media can suck hard - sometimes you just gotta watch cartoons.

Scared for my Trans Sister	Hello! My older sister recently came out as a transgender woman earlier this year. I’ve been very supportive and love her dearly. I had been worried about her safety but had tried not to think too much about it until recently I saw that the average life expectancy of a transgender individual was 30-35. This really scared me. Is there any way you’ve found to cope with this besides just trying to safe and advocate for transgender rights?	"I know that stat is widely reported but I believe it’s misleading. Trans women, in particular, have had a higher likelihood of a life of drugs and street life, which is dangerous and lowers life expectancy. On the other hand, being trans itself isn’t know to significantly lower life expectancy. Your sister can expect to live a long and healthy life as long as she’s supported by her friends and family.
Transgender people definitely face prejudice and violence, but that statistic (which gets cited a lot), is probably mostly baloney. That said, having social support from family and being in a safe housing and work situation will help any one, especially trans people, live a lot longer. Be there for your sister and make sure she isn't forced into dangerous situations due to stigma or bigotry.

Pretty good takedown of the statistic itself and where it might come from:

[https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/09/23/41471629/is-the-life-expectancy-of-trans-women-in-the-us-just-35-no](https://www.thestranger.com/slog/2019/09/23/41471629/is-the-life-expectancy-of-trans-women-in-the-us-just-35-no)
Thats a statistic ive never heard ?! Where did you read that ?
From looking around, it looks like that number/stat gets reported, but none of the articles actually provide where that number comes from.

I do believe the age is lower, just not sure if it is that low. 

If the number includes suicides, then the best thing to do for your sister is to give her as much love and support as possible.
30-35 is just complete bullshit. Where have you even heard this from? Were this true i doubt so many people would do hrt
I know enough Kung Fu (various Chinese martial arts) to feel I can competently defend myself and I carry a gun (legally).

Also I'd check if that statistic includes suicides by people who were not able to transition because of social
pressures and experienced intense dysphoria. Seems kind of low considering I am just starting the journey at age 32...
It's been a while since I looked at the original source, but that number is from a older study that was looking at life expectancy for trans women who are houseless and performing street level sex work. The conclusion of the study is that trans women without a support system who are forced into houselessness and sex work very young are at an elevated risk of being subject to violence.

Houselessness is dangerous for trans women. we are not allowed in many homeless shelters when we are subject to violence, and are often forced to house among men, which increases our risk of suffering violence. 

Houselessness  makes it more likely  a trans woman will be a target of police violence and incarceration, where they will be subject to violence from prison guards and the general male population they are housed with. 

To get off the streets, trans women in these situations often have to turn to sex work, which makes them vulnerable to pimps and police and the violence that the law puts on them for trying to earn a dollar in the profession they have available to them.

Some takeaways: 

Unless these apply to your sister, she will have similar life-expectancy to a cis person. 

BUT you should absolutely make sure that people understand that these obstacles DO exist for some trans women and understand how laws that criminalize sex-trafficking and homelessness are laws that harm trans women, and any other person of that profession and housing status. Also, donate to organizations that help trans women improve their lives with access to housing, such as [Trans Housing Coalition](https://www.gofundme.com/f/trans-housing-coalition-fund?viewupdates=1&rcid=r01-161616036222-a3ecf92c84944f3e&utm_medium=email&utm_source=customer&utm_campaign=p_email%2B1137-update-supporters-v5b).

Most people don't realize that the legal definition of ""Sex-Trafficking"" (at least in the U.S.) applies to sex workers who solicit a john for sex, not just the Ghislaine Maxwells and Jeffrey Epsteins of the world. So, if you want to help trans women, advocate against criminalizing legislation like [SESTA and FOSTA](https://www.antitraffickingreview.org/index.php/atrjournal/article/view/448/364), advocate for the [defunding and replacement of Police departments](https://theappeal.org/chicago-public-mental-healthcare-system-emergency-responder-program/), and for the [abolishment of prisons as we know them](https://theappeal.org/justice-in-america-episode-20-mariame-kaba-and-prison-abolition/).
Do you mean for you to cope or for her to cope?
This is true typically for trans women. I don't know if there is research even for trans men but I suspect it's higher than 35. This is double if it's trans women of color. It's a dark part of our reality, at least in the US.
Its not it's to hrt. I dont know if they pull numbers from countries that support trans people either. So I think the overall life expectancy would be like 5 or 10 years shorter than average for trans folks in the west but my best guess is that its 35 because of those transphobic countries who dont care if we live or die.
Oh 😥 would that be due to medical reasons or social reasons ? ... when you think it cant get any worst 😔
Social : discriminations (job, housing or healthcare), ostracisation, harassment/bigotry and assault.
Attitudes towards trans people in the US vary greatly but unfortunately we have a lot of bigots here. While I hesitate to say ""trans men have it easier"" trans men don't seem to be murdered at the same rate. Could be because there isn't enough data. Trans men tend to be underrepresented and it can be difficult to get find similar statistics. 

However there is this common thought I see where when trans men pass or stealth they are assuming male privilege. In regards to the bathroom or sports debate no one seems to care about trans men doing the same thing that causes controversy for trans women. Trans women are assumed to be ""giving up privilege"" and the perceived superior masculinity. This challenges and instills fear into bigots/transphobes. 

While it isn't mandatory to pass as a cis person, it can provide a shield from bigots. Unfortunately."	ocwmlb	trans	13	1.0	2021-07-03 11:52:54
I wish I was just born a guy.	"i'm a trans guy (he/they pls). i constantly go through my day-to-day being misgendered and deadnamed since i refuse to come out as trans. i'm scared that as soon as i do, i'll become an outcast and be bullied more severely than i am now.

i'm already hating the deadnaming and stuff, but then i look down at any time and i just see a woman. i see someone who has curves and cute little eyelashes and a chest. i wish i had a binder to cover it up but i don't because if i had one, it'd risk my own safety. i'm not sure how half my family feels about lgbtq+ people, much less me being trans. some people support it until their own friend or family member comes out as trans and i'm so scared. 

i don't want to be abandoned or abused because my parents don't support my choice of being who i was really meant to be and i'm so scared and i'm so tired. i just want to reveal who i am and end this whole cycle but i can't.

TLDR: Black transmasc non-binary person now starting to more frequently pass but feeling very annoyed with being coded cis man and aware of newly acquired safety	"Feeling mixed feelings about passing on occasion in public around oblivious cishets. 

Since the COVID-19 pandemic, mask-wearing has impacted how I’m perceived since I have fuller non-groomed eyebrows and visible facial hair (i.e. light but noticeable mustache, connected sideburns and beard). My cheeks (somewhat round) and un-adjusted voice out me.

As a Black non-binary person, I wish I could live in a world devoid of the racist patriarchal cisheteronormative gender binary entirely. I also recognize that my ability to pass (on occasion) can protect me from some patriarchal queerphobic harm. I, especially, don’t desire proximity to cishet men given their degree of broad-reaching global violence that I and those I have loved have faced. [Unfortunately, cis Black women I have dated have experienced heightened (mostly cishet male) homophobic violence because of how they’re coded sexuality deviant when in proximity to me.]

Facing anti-Blackness and having knowledge of gender theory/studies/binary history has helped me understand that the gender binary operates inconsistently when projected onto Black people (especially cis dark-complexioned monoracial Black women whether straight like Serena Williams or gay like Caster Semenya).

I’m pre-T with no immediate plans of doing HRT and, my whole life from early adolescence until early adulthood (now, in my twenties), I have been coded deviant (sexuality/gender). I have never liked the projections and harm from cishet people ranging from visual and verbal questioning (puzzled looks and bigoted remarks) to more extreme interpersonal harm (physical, psychological, emotional).

Growing increasingly tired of the gender binary, its societal and interpersonal implications, and my newfound coding from mostly androgynous (queer) to less ambiguous (binary cishet man) depending on circumstance."		120zr4q	trans	11	0.76	2023-03-24 21:43:02
Barely out of egg	"So, I’m walking around all day and going to meetings, and I thought I might just wear my most comfortable boxers and a man’s tank top under my masculine presenting clothes. I’ve got plenty of bras and panties in the hotel, but I figured I should give them the day off.

I’ve only just come out to myself, my wife, and my therapist. I haven’t begun to transition… other than the fact that my wife bought me a lot of feminine underwear to have on like a security blanket until I’m ready to take hormones and be out to everyone. 

But it’s more than just about keeping the wardrobe simple. I’ve been having doubts. Maybe I’m just a dude, and I’ve been seduced by an idea and gotten obsessed, and maybe I should back away. Maybe all these unforeseen changes that come with transitioning are just too much. My wife is supportive, but what if she’s not attracted to me any more? My marriage is the cornerstone of my life, and I don’t want to risk hurting it.

I’ve been wishing to be a woman for decades, and a few weeks ago I finally realized that it’s not a phase or a fantasy. I am a woman! And it felt so good to make that breakthrough, I started making all kinds of plans. 

But this morning I was ready to hang it up, call it off, tell my wife and therapist that it was just a fluke and I was wrong, and just thank God we hadn’t told the kids, or work, or my parents before it got too far.

This was the idea in the back of my head when I put those boxers on. It wasn’t that I was worried my thighs would chafe if I did all this walking wearing a thong under my slacks. It was about trying to go back into the safety of the egg.

I didn’t make it thirty seconds. I pulled those boxers up and looked in the mirror and thought I could do it, I could just wear these boxers and be a man and keep things safe. But the black lace in the drawer caught the corner of my eye, and as soon as I put the bra on too I felt a flood of relief. And it wasn’t about arousal… it was about feeling right.

So, onward, I guess. When I get back home from this conference I’m going to look for an endocrinologist. The real me won’t wait any more. She’s ready. 

It’s going to be some months before I’m ready to throw out the suits and ties. I need to get further down the road first. But I think it’s safe to lose the underwear. I wonder what the custodial staff at the Holiday Inn think when they find all my neatly folded boxers in the waste basket… straight from the suitcase and never worn."		tesqls	trans	12	1.0	2022-03-15 16:20:15
Help me make a care package for my sister's kid?	"So my sibling's kid(Imma call them G for privacy reasons) is trans, and they are going through a hard time right now. My sibling is divorced and they have shared custody, and the ex is .... Let's just say very bad. G is out to our side of the family, because they knew we would be accepting (I'm openly nb and have talked to the families kids about it), however someone on the ex's side is out and treated like trash(I'm told they also shit talk about me alot too), so G has not come out to them for safety concerns. 

G has just started puberty and is thus dealing with alot of the disphoria that entails. They are also dealing with isolation as my siblings ex took them out of the school they had been going to their whole life and they have not made any friends at the new school. (The new school is also very anti lgbt+)

We are all very worried about G, and recently they said some things that set off huge red flags. We have talked to G alot about it, expressed our love and concern, and they will be going to therapy for even more help (something they are happy about as they had gone before but my siblings ex took them out).

I talked to them alot about my own experience, and gave them some tips on how to fight intrusive negative thoughts. I gave them a journal to help them get out their thoughs and feelings. I ordered them a few binders, as it is something they have expressed wanting to help with the disphoria, but I still really want to do more. 

I've decided to make them a care package. I have a nice big shoe box that I plan to decorate. I bought them a  cat t-shirt in the colors of the trans flag(they love cats), some stickers from their favorite show, some pronoun pins, and a big trans flag for their wall. I plan to make them a card or a poster or something like that that says things like ""we love you"" ""things get better"" ""this too shall pass"" ""your valid"" and things like that, and maybe have the family sign it.

I would really appreciate if y'all could give me more ideas for either things to add to the box, or things to add to the card/poster. What do you wish someone had said to you, or given you as a young trans kid? (I had no idea I was nb until I was in my 20s, and had already been dealing with my body for years.) Or even things I can just say or do to help support them. I know I can't make everything better with gifts, but seeing them like this is breaking my heart, and I know something small can mean alot when your in a bad place."	"I wish someone would’ve told me “Im proud of you” you could add that. I think it’d be nice to just include a couple snacks too, i know it isnt trans related but that would be nice.
Honestly, a super heart felt letter. I had to suppress being trans as a kid into my teens (didn’t come out till 26) and I know that kind of stuff would’ve meant the world to me growing up. Also I dunno what kind of support y’all have but honestly, that kid should in no way be living with that kind of negativity. Being a teen/kid is tough and to add being trans on top of it, I honestly fear for situations of SH and such. I hope they find acceptable and love where they currently are 🥺🥺
I don't know about things to add there, they'd heavily depend on G's gender (which all I really know here is they wanted binders to help with dysphoria, so not transfemme I suppose, but as a non-binary person yourself you of course know that there are still multiple other options from that). If G is a boy or aligned with that sort of stuff (which I guess is probably the case considering the trans flag and not immediately also thinking non-binary flag), then I'd probably add in some more clothing that aligns with that (although I guess that'd work for any gender depending on what the clothes are), like not just a shirt but some new underwear, pants, maybe a new hat or something, some cologne, body wash, all the stuff that's generally gendered but doesn't directly relate to sex characteristics. Also make sure for the clothes that there's stuff that's relatively ""neutral"" in there too without any direct trans implications, because in some bad environments it may be necessary to hide but you wouldn't want them in clothes that make them outright dysphoric. Also, maybe a packer would be helpful? (in case you don't know, a packer is just like, a fake penis to put under clothes to have a bulge, packing is like the opposite of tucking, which I (a trans girl) liked doing (I say liked because as nice as I think it looks its not worth doing for me, can't keep tucked for long enough without it hurting, but that shouldn't be a big issue with a packer). Do also clear that last thing with your sibling though. You don't want to be sending their barely pubescent kid a plastic penis with no context. And of course some of these might not apply depending on G's preferences, which you should ask them about in regards to each of these things if you aren't sure.

Edit: menstrual products. As much as its gonna suck to receive them, it'll suck even more to deal with dysphoria on top of having the first period without them, and it'd still suck to have to get them in an emergency and not be able to seek out specific ones that don't assume everyone who uses them is a woman.
Thank you all for your input! It's very much appreciated!
Seconding this. Be honest, speak from empathy and personal experience. Platitudes like “it gets better” or “you’re valid” are nice and catchy, but they can sometimes feel empty. 

I have one really honest and supportful letter I got as a kid from a summer camp counselor. When I read it more decade later it still hits home."	sgwnpe	trans	11	0.83	2022-01-31 08:49:28
On passing and identity.	"Simply out of curiosity, I’m wondering how many trans people who pass don’t identify themselves as trans.
I know quite a few people who’ve said they’ll stop calling themselves trans when/if they pass.
I get why a lot of them do this, for most it’s simply done out of safety because a lot of the world is a shit place full of transphobes.
I don’t do this, however. I pass and I’ve never been shy about telling people I’m trans. I don’t blurt it out as a conversation starter, but if there’s an opening to insert that reveal, I have done so before. Most people are surprised, and say they wouldn’t have guessed, but otherwise almost everyone I’ve run into and told I’m trans has been cool with it.
I actually like revealing that I’m trans to others, since I’m the first trans person a lot of them know. I feel like I’m showing them that we’re just ordinary people, same as anyone else.

I should state that I don’t begrudge anyone for not telling others they’re trans, and I hope I haven’t given that impression. 
Like I said, I know there’s a lot of awful people out there, and I believe every trans person should prioritize their safety above all else. If telling people you’re trans would put your life at risk, absolutely DO NOT DO IT!
In fact, I’m really only able to do this in relative safety because I have the privilege of living in a suuuuper liberal state where LGBT people are generally tolerated.

I’m just wondering what are everyone else’s thoughts and experiences with this?
Feel free to share!😊"	"When I’m fully transitioned, I’m going to tell people I’m trans, (unless I’m in a very homophobic place or it’s like very overtly dangerous), because it’s a big part of my identity and I want to. I 100% get why some people don’t and that’s totally cool.
I have no idea where I'm going to be 2/5/9 years from now or if I'll pass but I hope I'm in a place to be open about my identity. It only serves the LGBTQ+ peoples to become a mundane example of humanity.
This might be that I'm in a small town in Texas, but I definitely do not disclose unless I'm dating them. For me, being trans isn't something I'm really proud of, just a necessary means to an end.
I continue to tell people I'm trans, because if I don't, then anyone who's got less passing privilege than I do has that much harder a time being treated with dignity and respect. And if being honest about myself helps so much as one person realize they can also be themself, then I will have done good in the world.

I don't fault anyone who goes stealth. I transitioned in Texas in 2000. Half my support group disappeared after therapy. I know a lot of reasons why someone would and I don't begrudge anyone who does. But to those who don't, especially if you could and choose to stay visible, you're doing divine work. Bless you all.
there's a difference  between  not telling people you are  trans - Stealth edition  and  not telling people you are trans because you are over outing yourself ...
I get it too, but I do like hearing that someone else is gonna be open about it.😊
I think telling people plays a big part in demystifying all the things others might have heard about trans people. It humanizes us."	ror8i4	trans	11	0.88	2021-12-26 06:33:19
Am I moving too fast?	"Just today I got a set date for my first HRT appointment (yay!!) and I am super excited. But I just started college, and my mom thinks I might be tackling too many important life changes at once, but I don't think that is all there is to it. The way she talked made it seem like she's scared that this is the wrong thing for me and I will end up in an even worse state than I am in now, and wants me to think on it a bit more, hence the question, am I moving too fast? I came out about 8 1/2 months ago, and had been questioning for about 4-5 years prior to that. I really think this is right for me, but I just don't know at this point and I need some advice, even just some kind words would help. 

Also for context, my mom is super supportive, she is just older and doesn't really understand it, and is only worried for my safety and wellbeing.   


Tldr; Is 4-5 years of questioning and 8 11/2 months of openly being trans to early to start HRT or other medical stuff?"	"Honey there is no “timeline” for being yourself, your journey is yours to travel❤️
Everyone is different I’d say. I’m at around 2 years questioning and am starting HRT next month, still not publicly out, and out to a handful of people. The only way to say if you’re moving at the right speed is if you feel comfortable and confident in making these decisions. Plus doing things like HRT is always better sooner rather than later.
I started HRT a bit over a year after I started questioning, but I also figured out I wanted HRT pretty quickly. as long as you know you want HRT, you aren't moving too fast.
Started transition in December 2019, living full time on hormones June 2020, name and gender change by August 2020. Now 71 y/o.
Honestly there’s not a timeline. I knew fully since 13. Ended up coming out at 26 years old on 11/12/21 and started hormones 11/23/21.
Just because you're starting HRT doesn't mean that you have to immediately present as your authentic self is going to take you months and months before you'll see any real physical changes that can't be disguised. So you still have time to present as you do currently for a while.. You were essentially going through puberty a second time, so I think it might be a good idea to get started and not really socially transition until you're ready
thank you, my mom is the biggest pillar of stability in my life, and it means the world to me that she is supportive even despite what she thinks I should do. It just that because I hold her opinion so high, it makes me question my own judgement at times, even if I feel so strongly that I am making the right choice."	xcyoav	trans	13	0.88	2022-09-13 05:07:59
Coming out to my folks....	"My (37, MTF, pre-HRt) parents are coming in to town for the holiday. They are here mostly to see the grandkids, and me...i guess. I feel like I am finally ready to start the discussion with my folks that I am trans. 

We've been drifting slowly apart over the last few years made worse by the pandemic. They always encouraged me to share anything with them, to dicsuss anything that was causing me trouble...i always assumed that never meant my GNC tendencies which i mostly hid from them. They frequently reminded me that i could talk to them about anything while growing up...and now my therapist belives that maybe they were signaling an invite to talk. That while growing up in late 90s/00s we lacked the vocabulary to discuss LGBTQ stuff, let alone trans issues. 

I told her that I was not nervous to share, and i feel like i need to while i have an opportunity to do in person. In person meetings are becoming more rare and i would rather not do this over the phone or through email. 

I do not rely on my folks for anything nor do i fear for my safety or career wellbeing. They live half a continent away, if i had to cut them out...then it would just accelerate the natural decline. But...i feel like they need to know, before i possibly end up separating from my wife. 

I feel like the 'Hey, we're done b/c I'm trans' is a little too much too quick. While separation is not a forgone conclusion...(and I really dont want it) i fear it is inevitable if i continue my (very slow) transition. 

Any words of encouragement or advice on how to break the news as a older gal would be quite welcome"	"No advice, just recognition. I'm 44, nonbinary, and currently starting to come out socially. Telling my parents is the thing I dread the most, even though I expect nothing but unconditional love and acceptance from them.
UPDATE: So I did end up coming out to my folks, not exactly the way I had expected but...the truth is out there now.

They were very accepting, like ""okay, that's a little different, but sure, you are our kid, we'll love you no matter what.""

It felt so relieving, but very anticlimactic. I was expecting a battle, some weird Fox-news fueled push back, but all i got was a ""We wish you could have shared this sooner, but understand that getting to this point was not easy.""

I was expecting to cry...but i just felt drained. And then the depression kicked in. I felt like a fraud. Like I'm yanking their chain, that this hasn't been a nearly constant signal in my head for years.

I'm feeling better, but the weird relief followed by depression was/is weird. I know that my desire to be more me will now be further boosted, but wow...what a kickback.

Anyone else feel this way?
Why do you need to tell them now, issue an internal ultimatum, and are presuming the worst outcome? If you have not begun your transition in earnest or are not in control of who you are, then consider holding off. In trying to understand your post, there seems to be insecurity/self esteem concerns that may doom the conversation even if you were to have it.

In all likelihood your parents want to see their grandkids more than you. Your parents have already lived with you for your whole childhood :-). Let them and your kids enjoy being together after a long COVID break. If you want to raise something, perhaps you could indicate you and your wife are going through issues and you may need to call your parents for their support.
I guess telling them along with having some semblance of a plan is what I would do.  They will be curious if you will transition and start hormones.  They may ask if your kids or wife know.  Personally I would tell your wife first.  She is the one who should be closest to you in the world.  And I would be kind of upset if you were telling others before her if I were in her shoes.

Otherwise huge hugs be safe it's really tough.   I came out to my wife nearly ten years before I transitioned.  I also started transition at age 37 and understand the challenges.  It's really tough when your life is interwoven with others.  Transition is a necessity for many of us to survive.  But it's also a fairly greedy process of self focus and finding your new footing and routine.   It's really hard to balance when you have kids and a partner relying on you. Not impossible but certainly more difficult.  Huge hugs I hope you get through it 🤗❤️
So I’m 42 and started hormones last December.  I came out to my wife first then we spoke to the kids together.  After that I came out to an older lesbian friend that was like a mom to me.  She was like, oh I thought that’s what this might be about. 😂

After that I came out to my boss, my parents, and my brother.  My parents aren’t together so that was two seperate phone calls.  Like you they’re half a continent away.  My mother took it badly and said hurtful transphobic things.  It’s since become clear that she’s also homophobic (all wrapped up in religion).

Coming out is hard.  It takes a lot out of you.  It’s stressful, nerve wrackin, just plain scary.  After those I had to take a break.  They were all pre-HRT.  

Over the first 7 months of hormones I came out to more people over time until now where I’m fully out in my personal life, I just need to come out at work which I’m doing this month. 

Even if your parents are completely accepting, they’re definitely going to ask why you aren’t staying with your partner.  I’m assuming she’s straight and told you that she would not want to be with a woman?
❤ Thanks. I used to dread telling them, but something recently broke/clicked and there is no fear. I am NOT looking forward to it, but it seems nessecary, like taxes.  I am hoping for the same...we'll see.
You bring up a fair point.... I guess, i'm wrestling with the idea that i would prefer to share this in person, not over phone and especially not a letter.

You are right, this is internal pressure - completely artificial. Though, if i let this opportunity slip...i dont know the next time i will have to do this in person. I had planned to take this to my grave or perhaps let them pass...but i hope that will be a long while. The plan to just internalize this has failed and i am on some sort of trajectory to transition. 

My wife is not an ally in this and i have no friends that are close and supportive. My wife's family is borderline adversarial to ' the transgenders', my family might be more accepting. I am not out to her family, but their casual transphobic and homophobic comments are just too frequent to belive rehabilitation/education will be effective.

If my folks are just neutrally acceptin or even just 'meh', that's lightyears ahead of any other feedback I've recieved.
This is so wrong.  She should come out when she’s ready.
Thank you for your suggestions. I have already come out to my wife, a while ago, but it now a thing we don't really talk about becuase she has been emphatically and consistently vocal on that she cannot continue in a relationship with a woman. Fair and valid.

So we dance, me exploring who i am and what i need, somewhat clandestinely so that i can have data about me and so i can do the weighing between staying in a realtionship with her and never achieving full actualization, or not...but at the cost of much of what i hold dear.

I guess i have reached a point in my journey where i am trying to seek allies...but more importantly safe harbors from the storm i see on the horizon. I do not wish to pull into port, and i hope the storm disappates, but...i've been on the ocean long enough to know to have a fallback.

Looping in my parents...now, at this point in time, is me trying to chart out safe harbors.
So...now I am curious...how did you feel after you came out to them (your parents). Were they accepting, and was that anticipated?
Aye, you hit it on the head. Like i said, separation may not happen, i hold out hope that we might be able to renegotiate our relationship...but she has been pretty firm in the not-into-femms side of things...so i dont see that changing.
>Coming out is hard. It takes a lot out of you. It’s stressful, nerve wrackin, just plain scary. After those I had to take a break. They were all pre-HRT. 

So...i think I am better understanding that. Coming out to my wife was brutal, just terribly hurtful. Coming out to my therapist was easy, my parents was easy...but unexpectedly so. Like walking into the bosses lair only to find the baddy absent and the loot chest still there for you. Weird. 

Didn't get a chance to come out to my brother...that could be interesting, but i the next hurdle i fear is my wife's family. Hard to call that one.
Fingers crossed for you <3
The time to share is in your control. It sucks. Hope I shared some thoughts for you to consider.

I absolutely love your Reddit name. It is powerful, assertive, and thoughtful. Imagery to aspire to. Better than a spiked critter, searching for knowledge. Philosophers are always sea urching.

Love you. Let us know how the visit turns out.
That makes sense.   Honestly my wife didn't think she could stay with me either.   I waited too though I wish I hadn't, things mostly worked out.   But I can understand your situation.   Its almost impossible to choose maintaining a marriage over transitioning.  How can you or your partner choose being miserable to stay together.  You can't.  If either person is put in the position of living a long term lie to themselves it eats the relationship inside out.   

So huge hugs what you face isn't fair.  And it's a huge reason people should push for children to get the love and support for gender issues early.  So they can transition earlier in life with confidence rather than later where they may face impossible life decisions.
My dad accepted me over the phone without issues.  But he's sexist and I was his ""perfect first-born son"".  So he's not actually taking it well at all.  We essentially don't talk.  Keep in mind he's not a great guy so I'm not missing much.

My mom was freaked out initially, she stated she loved me no matter what, but she was clearly a little confused from our first call.  Apparently she then outed me to my siblings asking if they knew why I felt the need to transition.  They fortunately told my mom it wasn't surprising I was actually a woman and made ALOT of sense.  My mom called me back a few weeks later and our conversation was completely different. She was extremely excited to be getting another daughter and had lots of questions.  Every since then we talk every week or two about anything and everything.  So its been great with her.

Honestly coming out to family is a crapshoot.  Some people will amaze you.  Others will really hurt you.  And you'll find acceptance in the strangest places!
Good luck with the in-laws.  We have so much coming out to do.  It can be frustrating and feel never ending.  It feels like looking up and seeing Mount Everest.  It’s amazing any of us get through this.
100% this! At least this is an area my wife and i agree-mostly. Let kids be themselves, they will tell you what they need if you listen without judgement."	x3trll	trans	11	0.87	2022-09-02 05:57:45

Wow, *what*? Was this guy posing as a trans girl IRL too? I'm a little confused what you mean by ""he was in trans activist circles in my city"". This stuff is happening way too often though, in our local IRL trans groups we've had to kick out *so* many cis men who claim to be ""allies"" because they were blatantly trying to use these groups to meet trans women.

u/RoninAndGeisha I mean that at my University, there was a activist group lead by trans people (including me) but welcoming cis allies, and in the past he helped out (barely). He moved out of the city since then.

He was posing in Telegram and Discord, talking to people he catfished from here, and to the surprise of absolutely no one would always back out of video/voice meetings with excuses.

He's not meeting anyone in person *afaik* but it's still obviously super gross.

Either:  
He stole her identity for catfishing (what I described)

Someone else hacked his accounts and used his identity to catfish with her pictures/identity

Blocklist of Mental Health Profesionals	"So, I know there's a list that's maintained showing the pros and cons, and results and controversies of surgeons offering trans surgeries. I'd like to know if we already have something like this for mental health professionals and if not, I believe it's something that may be important for us to have. 

Given what's coming to light with the new WPATH standards legitimizing/ adding credence to the idea of being transgender as a social contagion and other ROGD myths, I believe it's important that we work on establishing and maintaining a blacklist of professionals that subscribe to these debunked ideologies, as they're wholly unfit to treat transgender people or have transgender people as patients in any capacity. This could also help the community keep a close eye on mental health professionals offering ""gender exploration therapy"", which has been equated to sugar coated conversion therapy.

While people are speaking out against these sorts of requirements being laid out by WPATH (under the rule of Dr. Marci Bowers who subscribes to these sorts of rhetoric and ideologies), I believe it's unlikely that the community speaking out against it will affect any sort of change as she has been unresponsive to the community and other professionals to date.

This may be the only way we have to weed out the educated professionals from the uneducated professionals and prevent harm to trans people, both youth and adult. It could help trans people, both youth and adult, find providers that will give them relevant, meaningful, and equal care. On the flip side, it could be a resource for transphobic parents to find places to throw their kids in cuddly conversion camp or find a doctor that will provide the results *they* -being the transphobic parents- want, regardless of the safety or well-being of their trans child.



What would you think of such a list? For trans adults, do you believe the potential pros outweigh the potential cons? For trans youth, do you believe the pros outweigh the cons? If this gains traction I want to hear the opinions and other potential ramifications of such a list from both trans adults and trans youth, with an emphasis on the latter as the impact of Bowers' WPATH will have the greatest effect on them.


-------------------------

Note that unfortunately I'm not a mental health professional, so neither my input nor the implications of this list would affect the mental health professionals community. I am however a cyber threat intel analyst (I interpret data on threats, predict the moves of adversaries, and employ protections for future threats), and this seems like the next step forward against this system in order to protect trans lives, at least from my perspective. 

TL;DR - Should we generate a blocklist of mental health professionals and physicians that subscribe to anti-trans rhetoric and ideologies? Sound off below. Trans youth get greater visibility. Support them. They're most impacted by the new transphobic WPATH standards. Do you believe the pros of such a list outweigh the cons?"	"I think we should take it further than Reddit and establish a global register of health professionals in all fields related to transgender care, with a classification system telling people who to seek out and who to avoid.
Are you thinking of a scoring system like the BBB which provides ratings based on crowdsourced data?
Sort of. You could search for a given doctor and their page would come up with their info plus icons and labels indicating what to watch out for and whether or not to just avoid this doctor, eg. Kathy Rumer would have a big screaming ""WARNING: AVOID THIS DOCTOR AT ALL COSTS"" label on her profile."	rfo1oe	trans	11	0.92	2021-12-13 19:37:40
Mtf: Learning to pass - my journey	"I haven’t really told anyone about this, and I’ve been dying to share my story. But I also wanna be useful, so I structured this post in such a way that if the non-passing me of 2-years ago came across it, she’d find it at least a little helpful. **Here's the bullet-point TLDR:**

# TL;DR

* Certain personal circumstances are preventing me from getting HRT.
* As a result, over the past two years, I've learned not only how to express my gender identity, but also—for safety's sake—how to pass without HRT.
* It was a gradual process that involved getting clocked multiple times, engaging in awkward conversation, and feeling heavy bouts of discouragement. But eventually, I figured out what works for me, and life is incredible right now.
* If passing is one of your goals, I hope you can find something in here to help you.

# Brief Context: My physical appearance

I'm 5'9 with brown hair and blue eyes.

**The parts of my body that are advantageous to passing are as follows**: I have no body hair other than my legs and underarms. No facial hair either. My Adam's apple doesn't show unless I lift my neck all the way up. I also have longer-than-average legs, a flat stomach, a round face, and a small waist.

**The parts of my body that are less advantageous to passing are as follows:** I have broad, masculine shoulders and trapezius muscles. My arms are masculine as well. My leg hair grows fast. And my hands/feet are particularly veiny.

**My voice:** I've felt dysphoria since I was 4, and the first time I publicly experimented with my gender expression occurred when I was 13. More specifically, I had joined internet chatrooms and told everyone I was a girl. Nobody believed me until I joined voice calls. My prepubescent voice helped me a bit, but sometimes I'd get vocally clocked in these chatrooms. Consequently, I practiced feminizing my voice at a young age. **As of today, I'm in my twenties and have over a decade of experience feminizing my voice. This is one of the largest—if not the largest—contributing factors to my passing.** However, I did cough \*a lot\* while practicing. Not to mention, I've drank buckets of hot water and tea to soothe my throat as I fleshed out the details of my voice.

Today, I'm in stealth, and a decent amount of people in my life don't know I was AMAB. As a result, I'm not posting pictures just yet, just in case someone I know stumbles across this post. Nevertheless, the following are the five ""checkpoints"" of passing I've reached over the past couple years.

\--------------------------------------------------

# Checkpoint 1) Not passing

**What I looked like:** I still had the body I described above, but I was too impatient to let my hair grow out. As a result I wore a wig. A hideous pink wig that looked synthetic, even from afar.

I wore my baggiest boy clothes because I didn't own girl clothes yet. And I had no makeup.

**How I knew I was at this point:** I got clocked left-and-right. Strangers snuck photos of me in public places. I'd get some double-takes in the restroom. People would squint at me from across cafes, bars, stores, and restaurants only look away when my gaze shifted in their direction.

Also, restaurant/store employees flubbed my pronouns a bunch. And people would often engage in verbal gymnastics to avoid having to use the words ""he"" or ""she"" when referring to me.

But despite the social backlash, it felt good to publicly present a little more feminine than I had typically done before.

**What needed to change:** I *badly* needed to change the wig. And I needed girl clothes. And makeup. I wasn't playing to my body's strengths. Sure, my baggy clothes hid my most masculine features, but I wasn't wearing anything that accented my more feminine features.

Also, my body language was a mix of maculine and feminine. I'd been socialized as a boy, and my mannerisms reflected that. I spread my legs when I sat down, broadened my shoulders when I stood up, and rubbed my chin with my hand every now and then.

**How long I was in this stage:** 2 months.

# Checkpoint 2) Passing, but only in passing

**How my look changed from the previous checkpoint:** I got two new wigs. The first matched my natural brunette hair. The second was blonde (because I heard they have more fun). I also got girl clothes that accented my body's more feminine features:

Namely, all my tops were long-sleeved to hide my shoulders and biceps. And many of them were cropped enough to show my waist. I also started wearing and stuffing a bra, which made my waist seem even smaller compared to my upper body. I wore high-waisted jeans and shorts. And of course, I waxed my legs and underarms. And at this point, I didn't do any makeup except mascara.

**How I knew I was at this point:** The stares stopped. Nobody looked at me strangely in the restroom, or even in the restroom line. Sometimes other girls in the line would smile at me or start some small talk, especially in clubs/parties. But I'd intentionally keep these conversations short, since I wasn't confident enough in my looks just yet.

I do remember a couple times where I was clocked mid-conversation. Sometimes it was my body language that gave me away. Other times, it was my outfit. For example, I remember once a boy was trying to buy me a drink at a bar. He started off flirty and confident. But halfway through the conversation, he started squinting at me a bit. Slightly tipsy, he flat-out asked, ""Are you trans?""

I panicked, said no, and planned my escape. Thankfully the bartender—who had carded me and eventually had befriended me after regular visits—came by and saved the day. She joined the conversation and made up a story about how she and I were members of the same sorority. (I was still in college at this time.)

And that leads me into perhaps the biggest indication that I'd \*just\* started passing: my treatment in bars and clubs. Every weekend, I'd go out with either a couple girl friends or a few gay friends. As usual, bartenders and bouncers would check IDs. And whenever I'd hand mine over, I'd get a ""Hey, sweetheart"" or something to that effect. Then they'd look at my ID and do a double-take. They'd remain professional, but you can't hide unexpected shock.

To me, those double-takes represented progress. If the difference between my in-person presentation and my photo ID presentation were different enough to elicit suprise, I'd say I'm more passing than I was when I first started wearing wigs.

**Some ways I got clocked at this stage**:

1. I was silly enough to wear leggings without tucking, so I got clocked at Lululemon. But the saleswoman was extremely nice and inclusive.
2. At this point, I was using my feminized voice for 8-10 hours a day on weekends, and my vocal cords would sometimes get tired. I don't have this problem anymore, but back then I remember one time I got clocked while buying Girl Scout Cookies. The mother behind the counter was guiding her daughter through thre transaction. The mom said things like ""Can you tell the nice lady how much a box of thin mints costs?""

But then my voice cracked mid-transaction. And suddenly the mother started stuttering and doing those verbal gymnastics I'd been so familiar with just a few months prior.

3) When a wig is new, it looks too perfect to be realistic. I learned that the hard way. Little tip: before bringing a new wig into the public, spend a day wearing it in private. Toss it around, tie it up, etc. Just fluff and mess with it a little to get rid of that fake, packaged look.

4) Certain clothes gave me away, but others didn't. I had to learn—by sheer trial and error—which clothes helped me pass. Thankfully, I had a couple friends in one of the campus sororities who were willing to help me out. After class, they'd bring me to the house, and we'd determine to the best of our abilities which outfits worked.

5) I learned the blonde wig was too blonde for my skin tone. A very sweet, extroverted woman approached me while I was sitting at a bar, and after we exchanged introductions, she said two sentences: (1) ""You're really pretty"" and (2) ""I love your wig.""

My eyes widened at the second sentence. Then she explained she was a hairdresser. ""I've seen that wig before,"" she said. ""That's the only reason I could tell. I'm certain that nobody else could ever know.""

She bought me a drink and gave me some hair tips. Since then, I've been a full brunette.

**How long I was in this stage:** 3 months

# Checkpoint 3) Passing in the short-term

**How my look changed from the previous checkpoint:** I'm a full-time brunette. I learned how to do makeup to varying degrees—whether I'm just keeping it casual with gloss and mascara, or if I'm doing everything.

""Everything"" for me, by the way, is moisturizer -> foundation -> concealer -> tinted SPF -> powder -> eyelash curler -> mascara -> lip gloss -> lip oil -> perfume. In that order.

I had also been applying lotion daily for 4 months at this point. And twice a week I’d exfoliate my whole body and wear a face mask (those fruit-flavored Sephora ones). The result was smoother, softer, glowier skin all over.

Also my voice doesn't get tired anymore.

And as for clothes, my wardrobe expanded \*a lot\*. I now had clothes for winter, spring, summer, and fall. I also got a few formal dresses, party dresses, business attire, and business-casual attire.

**How I knew I was at this point:** When I say I'm ""passing in the short-term"" I mean that I'm passing for a few hours or maybe a few days. At this point, I'm going to class in full female regalia. Nobody's misgendering me *upon first glance*. I'm partying at the frats with girl friends. Boys would hit on me, and sorority girls would try to ask if I was seeing any of the fraternity guys, ""so we don't step on each other's toes."" And if a bartender doesn't card me, I'd typically get a few free drinks.

What I find funny is that more than a handful of times, those bartenders would brag about a cocktail of their own creation that made it to the menu. I'd always just say ""Cool!"" and nothing more. Then a few moments later the drink they were just talking about appears in front of me as a ""free sample.""

But even though I was passing to bartenders, my classmates, and fellow partiers, I knew I couldn't pass for more than a few days or weeks. I couldn't, for example, spend the night at another girl's place without taking off all the stuff that helps me pass: wig, makeup, clothes, etc. Settings like beaches and yoga classes are also a no-go.

One time, I was with a girl friend at a bar. We ran into another pair of girls—tourists from Belgium—and struck up a conversation. Long story short, we hit it off. But I was stupid enough to drink too much that night. In my stupor, I don't know what I said or did, but the next morning, the four of us met for breakfast, and one of the Belgian girls asked, ""Are you transgender?""

They were super nice, but I kicked myself for getting clocked.

Nevertheless, if I stay sober, I can pass for hours or days:

Weeks before graduation, I ran into one of my best friends, Alexa, at the mall. Alexa's always known I'm trans, but the friend she was with—Lauren—had no idea. Alexa invited me to tag along with them. They were going dress shopping for graduation, and they needed something white. I spent the whole day with Alexa and Lauren, trying on dresses, getting frozen yogurt, and just wandering the mall.

A few days later, Alexa visited me at my dorm. I asked her if Lauren clocked me.

Alexa said, ""No, she had no idea. Actually, when we got back to our car, the first thing Lauren asked me was '*Hey, is your friend's hair always that perfect?*'""

I've kept the same hairstyle ever since.

**Ways I got clocked**: At this point, I'm only getting clocked if I make a ""mistake"" like showing my arms or messing up my voice. As long as I'm covering my biceps, nothing happens.

**How long I was in this stage:** 1 year

# Checkpoint 4) Passing in the long-term

**How my look changed from the previous checkpoint:** No more wigs, just my natural hair. I have a go-to hairdresser, nail tech, and waxer now. Also, I added highlight and blush to my makeup routine. I tried eyeliner for a bit, but I couldn’t really make it work. Occasionally, if I feel like putting in the effort, I'll wear false lashes.

Through a new workout regimen, my body became naturally curvier—more toned legs, the classic ""11 line"" abs, smaller waist, less fat in my cheeks. Sadly, my ribcage and hips are still about the same size, but there's not much I can do about that.

**How I knew I was at this point:** I'm in full stealth, and anyone new I meet has no idea I was born male. I pretty much get cis-woman treatment all around. For example, my dating life is pretty normal. While I've accepted that being trans is a dealbreaker for some boys, a good chunk of my Tinder/Hinge matches don't mind. Though I'll admit there's an element of pretty-privilege there.

I've also learned that I pass in my sleep: This past Halloweekend, I ended up crashing at the house of a girl I've never met after a whole day of barhopping/partying. Neither she nor any of the other girls in the house clocked me. There were no weird looks, no passing glances, no random ""subtle"" references to the transgender community. We just woke up, shared brunch, and got into our costumes for Halloweekend Day 2.

During that brunch, by the way, the other girls and I learned a lot about each other. I didn’t come out to them though. But when they found out I was single and heard what my type was, one girl actually set me up with one of her guy friends on a date. (It went ok.)

**How long I was in this stage:** I'd say I'm still in this stage. Though there's another stage I wanna talk about...

# Checkpoint 5) The people who know I'm trans forget I'm trans

**How my look changed from the previous checkpoint:** I've just looked the way I look for a long time. Consistency does amazing things.

**How I knew I was at this point:** Only people who've known me my whole life—my parents, my childhood best friend, certain other family members—can really vividly recall what I looked like growing up. But newer friends, coworkers, and romantic interests don't really pay attention to my being trans at all.

I have a page in the Notes app of my phone dedicated to the number of times someone has said, “Oh yeah, I forgot you’re trans.” So far it’s happened four times: once from my old roommate from college, once from a local bartender, once from the guy who runs my local smoke shop, and once with my bestie Alexa.

As of today, I'm fully in stealth.

# Denouement

A good chunk of my local neighborhood knows I’m trans. Though we never really talk about it unless something happens in the news or if there’s a pride parade.

I still have my limitations: Although I’m passing enough to date around and go to clubs, I don’t feel comfortable enough to go to the beach or visit the Deep South (where I partially grew up). I think activities like those will only be unlocked once I start HRT.

Learning to pass wasn't easy. And there were moments in my journey that still make me wince to this day. But as a friend once told me, ""Reaching your goals—from passing, to language-learning, to performance art—often requires you to pass through a valley of cringe as you make progress.""

Anyway, if you’ve made this far, thanks for reading about my little journey. I haven’t really shared this with anyone, so it feels really good to finally let it all out. Hope you enjoyed!

Doing my best,

Liv"	thank you so so much for sharing. this makes me so hopeful for the future for myself. I'm just really starting my journey and this helps so much. thank you.	12ndulw	trans	11	0.79	2023-04-15 18:31:14
Can your workplace force you to use your dead name if you haven't officially changed it yet?	"My partner just passed a licensing exam for his job and got an email from his company asking him to use his dead name. He's still waiting for his surgery and doesn't want to change his name legally before that.
Plus his dead name is super feminine. He passes as a male too. I am petrified that him using his dead name is a safety concern. Tralnphobia is so real and he will be in a customer-facing role. I don't want weird looks, judgements, or mean words flying his way while he's just trying to do his job.
He's comfortable using his legal name (dead name) on the licence and pay role etc. But why dies he have to use it fir his business cards and email signature?
It's so disheartening and I will fight with the world for him. He deserves to be respected and valued.
He's the kindest human ever and I just want him to be happy. This whole situation is bonkers and I don't know what to do.
Please advise!"	"do they make cis people use their full legal name, Elizabeth instead of Liz, Abraham instead of Abe, etc?
I'm so sorry your partner is having to deal with that shit.   
If possible I would definitely check with a lawyer about the legality of what they are asking to do.

I work in the laboratory field and we need to have official documentation regarding name, initials, and signature since we sometimes do GMP activities. Nicknames here are normally fine for your official signatures unless its something significantly different from your legal name, in that case an official name change is usually needed.
If his name isn’t legally changed then a license for whatever would need to say his legal name. Just like payroll. Idk about business cards and such. Why doesn’t he want to change his name legally?
I did have to use my birth name at a job.  I was going to change it anyway.  But, that sped up the process.
Yes, as long as you have not legally changed your name.
You can ask to be called your preferred name but your pay check will still be in your legal name.
Surprising yes. For instance, they allow Chinese people use English names. My partner's colleagues are some of them.

But now he says that they're going to ask everyone to change. Which is also strange. So, Idk.
Like I said in another comment. He wants to change is name after the surgery. And I support that 100%. He should change his name when he's ready and not when he's forced by rules imposed by an unfair employer.
You should change your name whenever you're ready, not because you're rushed by the pressure of fitting into the corporate culture.
And that's totally okay. All banking and legal purposes have my partner's legal name. I just don't see the point of them asking him to update the name on his business card and email signature.
did they only ask everyone to change when he started? that would be kinda suspicious
 If it’s a license it needs to say the legal name. I went through the same situation prior to my name change. I came out socially and use a preferred name but my license for insurance company so I could sell insurance and make sales I made had to be in my legal just like payroll. He’s free to change his name whenever but his employer has the right to put their legal name because that’s what’s on the ID and they probably have to for legal purposes. Also I didn’t see any other comment, I didn’t scroll through the conversation recently.
I’m 50.  I don’t need anybody to tell me what I *should* do about my name, or anything else.
Only asked everyone to change after asking him to change.
100% suspicious. It would have been a total case of discrimination with a massive shit storm for them, but he told them in the interview that he is trans and he goes by his current name while using his dead name for all legal purposes until he gets it officially changed and updated.

The most unfortunate part is that they're holding his licence hostage. I am so infuriated. I am a cis-woman and guess what? I don't go by my full legal name. I have a preferred name and lot of my colleagues do too. Granted I am in a senior management, corporate role with a whole 'nother company, but my partner's company sings about inclusion and diversity unlike any other I have seen before and thy don't know how to handle it.

My partner worked so freakin hard to clear his exam and now for him to be experiencing this BS urrghhh! It makes me so mad.
Thank you for sharing the added context. The lincense is okay. He has his legal name on all legal documents and payroll etc.
His concern is business cards and email signatures, primarily. As an insurance professional, did you have to use your legal name for the email signature and business cards?
still could be a discrimination lawsuit, I'd have him talk with a lawyer. it's pretty hard to hide being trans if you're post-HRT with a fem/masc dead name.
Yep, I could tell my clients my preferred name but any documents I had to send them for policy or survey or email had my deadname. Their wasn’t an option to change it in the system since it was my legal name it had to be used.
Do you know if this is a violation of any specific laws. (I understand that you're not a lawyer) 
We're in Canada, if that helps.
I too live in Canada, and that is definitely illegal. We are a protected class in canada, purposful deadnaming and misgendering in the work place is considered discrimination. Your legal name must be on all legal documents, but that's it. Does the company have an HR you can talk to? If not, this is probably a talk to a lawyer moment. If the company likes to yell about how inclusive and progressive they are, they really wont like a public scandal outlining how discriminatory they are.
This is great information. Is there a source that we can use to cite during our conversation with a lawyer/HR?
You'll want to look up Bill C-16. I have linked a webpage outlining some basic examples of discrimination, but there are a good amount of pdfs available to read through if you google search ""trans discrimination law canada"" or similar. 
https://nelliganlaw.ca/blog/2slgbtq-human-rights-in-the-workplace/ 
Unfortunately there are a fair bit of places in canada still that blatantly break this law. I highly recomend documenting all interations with the work place in question until it has been resolved (saving all emails, and recording conversations when possible- only 1 person in the convo needs to consent for the recording to be legal).
Thank you so much. This is super helpful. You're an amazing person and I am so so grateful for your help."	yghud4	trans	11	0.88	2022-10-29 12:01:30
Someone I work with apologized to me but I'm still upset	"I work in a drug store and there is a high level of theft that happens so one of my responsibilities along with everyone else in the store is to work with the security guards to make sure people don't steal. Tonight a guy who was seriously buff came in and shoved some expensive perfume in his shirt. My gut was telling me was dangerous so instead of calling him out i called the security guard to help. The dude got away.

The security guard came back and got mad at me for not calling him out. This has been going on for a while now and its frustrating. I don't pass perfectly and some people are really mean. 

He treats me like a dude and misgenders me and I feel like he expects things from me that he wouldn't ask the cis women who work there. 

This time I finally stood up for myself and told him that I'm just looking out for my safety too and then I walked away trying not to cry. He apologized to me later and I believe it was a sincere apology but I'm still upset. I'm just so tired of the way people treat me when all I'm trying to do is pay my rent and get through the day."	You did the right thing on both accounts. Any self-respecting company always tells their employees to comply and not try to be the hero. It's about your safety first. Your job isn't to be the security guard, it's his. He seems like a swell guy for sure. /j You still have a right to be upset. If I was in your shoes, I wouldn't trust his words cause it seems he's made many mistakes he hasn't tried fixing.	wjtbqu	trans	12	0.93	2022-08-09 03:57:18
24, AMAB, identified as NB for years but figured out that I’m actually just a woman. Worried about my partner.	"First time poster. I usually spend my time on this sub looking at all your gorgeous faces and thinking “YES MAMA” and “YES PAPA” and “YES YOU BEAUTIFUL ENBY ANGEL”.

So I’ve been thinking that maybe I’m trans for a few months and then, while speaking to one of my trans friends, it just sorta clicked.

I’ve never felt particularly “manly” or that the label of “man” fit me. Since I was about 19 I started identifying as non-binary. That worked while I was studying because I could just wear and act however I wanted but then I graduated and had to get a real job. I grew a beard and started acting more masc to fit in with the kind of people I work with. (Coming out as trans at work is gonna be HELL but that’s for future me to worry about.) So the acting manly thing really triggered some dysphoria and discomfort for me. I thought maybe I just wanted to present as NB more often (I use they/them pronouns) but, long story short, I’m a woman.

I’ve come out to a few close friends and it’s been amazing. They’ve been so supportive and helpful and caring and it’s made me feel incredible. Obviously I’m a long way off HRT or any procedures, but I have an appointment with my doctor to get the ball rolling soon.

My problem is the interaction I had with my partner when I came out to her (cis woman, been together 7 years). She’s always been accepting of and comfortable with me identifying as NB but I’m starting to think that comes down to how masc I was presenting because of work and where I live. She doesn’t care that I’m trans. She is happy to be in a relationship with a woman and if I could flick a switch tomorrow and wake up a cis woman, she’s still be here and happy.

But she’s worried about our safety and how she’s going to have to approach her family. We may have to move because of the area we live in. Her family and our neighbours think I’m just a cis man because who has time for the NB conversation with obvious bigots? But I want to be an out trans woman. I want to present as a woman in public and at family events. And this seems to make her very uncomfortable. I understand the safety issue because I might have a hard time passing (big chin, like 3-foot shoulders and I have to shave my face twice a day), but I tried to convince her it’s all a long way off and I haven’t even spoken to a doctor yet. But for me it’s getting more and more real and I want things to move as quickly as possible. How do I make her feel OK? I told her I understood if she didn’t want to go through all this and that I’d understand if she wanted to leave. Her life shouldn’t have to get worse because of me, but she says “I’m gonna have to do it because I love you”. Which was nice to hear but it feels like I’m forcing her into a different, dangerous life where she might have to cut ties with her family. 

TL;DR my partner is worried about me publicly presenting as a woman because of her safety and family. What can I do to make things better/easier?"	"[removed]
Thanks for the kind words. But also fuck off with that NB erasure shit. My identity was valid before I came to this realisation and my NB friends are still valid. Don’t spread hate in the name of trans pride, please.

I’m scared for my safety at school	"Hey all, this is my first post but it feels like I don’t have anyone to tell or talk to about this. I’ve felt so nervous these past few days. I used to be friends with a person at my school that I came out as trans to, up until we had a falling out over their behaviour and violent outbursts. We haven’t talked to each other in ages but yesterday they were talking to a group of girls I don’t know and all of a sudden I heard, “They’re trans?” With the girls looking at me in confusion. I’m scared they might be outing me to people in my high school, I told my best friend about it and he said I should report them to pupil support but I’m scared I’d get outed to my parents if the school takes action? What can I do? Whenever they mention me they always deadname and misgender me and they’ve told random people about my medical history too, I feel so trapped because they know such a private thing about me and I can’t do anything about it.


[TL;DR] I think my old friend is outing me as transgender to people at school and I’m scared because I’m not fully out yet."	"Ok this is a very scary situation and I'm sorry your going through it. First you need go talk to your freind maybe there not outing you maybe they are but you need to know. Also you might be able to steam the flow. Next go to the councilors they are trained to help in these situations. You might also want to consider just embracing it, once its out you take the power away. And you will be suprised about how much support you have in building. 

Just make sure you dont freack out and do something harsh are with out thinking you have options. It will be better.
Thank you very much for responding to me so quickly, I think I’ll ask the girls they were talking to to definitely make sure and I will see a school counsellor like you suggest. :) If push does come to shove I’ll try my hardest to embrace being out at school, I know it’s gonna be hard, but I have a few close-knit friends that’re also LGBT+ so I know I’ll always have them to support me, so it won’t be all that bad. Reading this made me feel a lot less scared, thank you so much for giving me advice
No problem. 

I'm a teacher my self and if you need any one to talk to are any insight from the teachers perspective please dont hesitate to ask.
I will, thank you again, you’ve been so kind to me and I can’t thank you enough"	douwh7	trans	10	0.92	2019-10-29 19:34:22
Husband might be trans but says he doesn't want to transition	"Note: I'm saying he *might* be trans because he isn't sure he actually is.

A week and a half ago, my 40 y.o. husband of 12 years told me he has always felt like a woman in a man's body. I'm trying to be as supportive as I can be, and told him that I never want to be the reason he doesn't transition if that is what he wants. But I'm 36, cis woman and I'm not bisexual, and told him I'm only attracted to men, so we very likely wouldn't have sex anymore, and I wasn't sure if I would want to remain married, but I'll always love him and be his best friend. He is not attracted to men. 

He has done tons of research into surgery, treatments, etc., as he has been thinking about this for years. He claims he is fine with continuing to present male in public for the sake of his safety and career (he's pretty high up in a residential homebuilder company). He says he's lived half his life as a man so it's no big deal to live the rest of it that way. Most of all, he says that I mean more to him than anything and that alone is enough to deny his longing to have breasts and curves and facial reconstruction. He's 6'1"" and has a very masculine frame and proportions, and he's handsome and has very manly features.

He has decided he's non-binary after I introduced him to the concept (probably poorly) and he's happy being able to wear women's clothes at home (I took him shopping and have been helping him find clothes and learn the complexities of women's sizes), and wearing panties and pantyhose under his guy clothes is enough for when he's out of the house, but I feel that he is compromising for my sake, and it won't be enough for him in the long run. 

I admit that I'm having a hard time, and it's selfish to be thinking about how this impacts me and my happiness. I'm happy that he is happier, and he really is. He loves his new clothes (bonus for me is we wear the same size skinny jeans and skirts and we're both fine sharing clothes).

Is it possible that he really is/will be okay with not being a woman? He is looking for a therapist, at my insistence, to help him figure out what he really wants. I am also looking for one who specializes in treating the partners of people who come out later in life. 

Does anyone have any advice for me? I love him so much, and I love him even more now because him being himself is more to love. If there's a better sub to post this in, let me know.

Edit to clarify that he had previously not known non-binary existed until I brought it up.

Edit again - we've been together for 14 years, married for 12"	"Transitioning (or even not transitioning) looks different for everybody. And it might take some time for your partner to know what feels right. It’s all valid though. 

Therapy is a good step!
Ultimately it’ll depend on them. I know I compromised a lot along the way even after coming out for fear of disappointing my loved ones. They may be saying that they are ok only so far as to please you. Then again, I don’t know you nor your partner and I’m a random stranger on the internet to take this with a grain of salt."	iof3tw	trans	11	0.93	2020-09-07 20:13:33
Dealing with transphobia is taking a toll on my perspective of humanity	Ever since coming out socially and waiting for the insanely long queues in my country's mess of a transgender healthcare system, I've found myself spiralling down. Suddenly I notice transphobia in places where I never expected it. Other subreddits, the media, friends of friends, even a few friends with whom I've cut ties. It feels like all I can see is the worst in humanity and trust has become a rarity. On the streets I'm just counting down to the next time I'll be harassed. I've found some kind souls who are accepting, but there is just so much fear. Where coming out is objectively a step towards happiness for me, every step I take towards making sense of myself and my life is at some point thwarted by people actively pursuing hate speech. Where do these people even get the energy to hate on people wanting to just exist? All trans people ever ask for is for a place in society without fearing for their safety. It is such a test of my patience to not respond to hate with hate. Trying to educate people who simply don't want to understand differences is tiring me out. Do you lot manage to stay positive at all? How do you do it?	"[removed]
I've been thinking about this a lot lately too. How can we really hope for a better future, when people are so easily manipulated to hate us. It's hard not to be a doomer sometimes lol.
You've missed the point of OP's post.

This is not about ""our healthcare has been deprioritized because of the pandemic."" Our healthcare has been deprioritized because right-wing populism, in some cases, outright fascism is on the rise globally in response to capitalism's failures, and under fascist and proto-fascist regimes any and all perceived differences can and will be used to justify othering and dehumanization.

OP, I stay positive by reminding myself that the kinds of things you're seeing are symptomatic of a deeply unhealthy cultural malaise and I do my best to isolate myself mentally and spiritually from it. I look for others who also see how toxic the world has become and I do my best to help keep their spirits bright. I keep my eyes on the future and I do my best to live my truths despite the world turning to shit."	roysjr	trans	11	0.93	2021-12-26 15:14:16
I feel less like a whole person and more like a constant swapping persona	Due to my circumstances, I don’t feel safe enough to come out as a trans woman, so I constant am dead-named and misgendered. Instead of having a ‘true’ and ‘fake’ identity (true being a woman and fake being a cis man) I constantly feel like I’m swapping between two different personas. Findlay (birth name) out of a need for safety and Lily (chosen name) which is just me. Due to how often I am forced to live as Findlay, I don’t feel I have enough time to cement Lily as myself, as I only realised I was trans recently, but I can’t make any changes to my environment aside from forcing myself to come out and hope that in don’t suffer any invalidation. I feel more like I’m living two different lives rather than simply using a facade for safety, which makes the self inflicted doubt and invalidation much harder to manage. Does anyone have any advice and/or is this a problem that other people have or are facing?		rifwhm	trans	12	0.94	2021-12-17 11:59:01
How should I approach using the bathroom at school? (Ftm, 16)	I recently asked my principal if I could use the men's, he told me no because of safety concerns on his part. I am allowed to use the gender neutral bathrooms in the office but I am rarely near by there, so I have to hold it in or miss some of class. I really don't know what to do besides just going against what he said and using then mens.	"I don't know a lot about your situation, or what you're school is like. But if you feel safe, and think your principal is over reacting, then you shouldn't need anyone's permission. You shouldn't have to miss class time because someone else is anxious. If you get in trouble, ask your principal if they've seen the movie Hidden Figures. It illustrates how unfair racially segregated bathrooms are. (though it isn't historically accurate!)
yeah, just use the mens

fuck authority
You might remind the principal that their policy violates title 9 protections and cough pointedly about lawyers
Discrimination in schooling title IX makes such discrimination based on sex illegal and a recent policy decision by the justice department says this is to be interperated in the same way as title 8 so it includes gender, sexual orientation, and weather you are trans or cis
Connect with the other trans/non-binary students at the school. And either go to bathroom as a group or show the necessity of a policy change
Thank you, my school is very safe and I am well trained in self defense anyway. There has never been any type or rape or things as such here. I worry that I'll be in trouble and it will reach my father, in which he is not supportive.
Title 9 protections?
Sadly I'm one of the only trans kids here, there are 3 nonbinary people but they dont really seem interested in messing around with that stuff.
Maybe you could have a talk with your principal. You could tell him that you understand his concerns, but that his decision is causing greater harm, and is impacting your education. Maybe mention that scene from a Hidden Figures, so that he can put his decision into a historical perspective. Asking good questions can also be powerful. You could ask ""how can I use the bathroom in a way that doesn't negatively impact my education?"" Or ""what are your safety concerns, and how can we address them in a way that's more comfortable for me?"" That way, you're not telling him what to do, you're giving him an opportunity to reflect and emphasize. 

I hope that helps!
If you're in the US, you legally have the right to use the boys' bathroom at your (public) school.

"should be fine if you can get access to it, but it might be hard to find . Secondly it's important to try and make sure you're getting the correct dosage.

A letter to my parents:	"Look, I know a lot has been going on lately, and you both are worried about a lot of things at the moment…

I, too, am worried about a lot of things as well…

I know that you worry about my safety and well-being, but I am not 10 anymore; I am 21. I have been a legal adult since I was 18. 

The thing is, I can’t allow you to pay for something that won’t help me in the end. I can’t be “more manly”. I can’t live my life that way…

 I totally understand where you are coming from, because you both grew up in the time of Exodus, which was a “conversion therapy convention”, if you will… Conversion therapy has been banned by the American Psychological Association, and has been proved to be a false therapy practice for YEARS.

Conversion therapy won’t help me. Testosterone won’t help me. 
HGH won’t help me.

The only thing that will help me is an actual therapist that is both licensed and that deals with gender dysphoria.

The DSM-5 states that someone with gender dysphoria has only one type of treatment; for children, it is puberty blockers until they reach 18 when they can start HRT treatments; for adults, it is a strict regimen of the corresponding HRT to their gender identity.

I’ve been on this road for 4 years now, and I’m not backing down this time... Every time I back down, you think that it’s done and over with, but in all actuality it’s never left. It won’t leave, and I’m old enough to know the risks and benefits to HRT treatment.

I overheard your conversation this morning about this treatment, and I’m trying to save you both some money…

I know that you’re afraid of what family might think, or what friends might think, or how I’ll get a job, etc etc, but I don’t care. This is my life, and I am the sole person that is allowed to make that decision. I am the patient, after all. 

I will literally be going through another puberty when I start HRT. It will take some time for people to adjust, and I understand that. It will take time for me to adjust at first too… I am mentally aware of that.

Dad constantly says that he doesn’t want another dead son…

Do you want your child to be depressed and angry all the time, or do you want a happier child in the future? 

To put it simply:
 Do you want a “dead” son, or an alive daughter? 

I have been mentally numb for the last 4 years, and over those years, it has been getting increasingly worse. Sure, there are some days where I am happy, like when I work on the drift car or go to a drift event, but there are some days that I don’t pay attention to the day-to-day things, because every time that you bring up this stuff, I mentally shut down. 

Accepting me as who I truly am is choice that you have to make… I have made my choice, and I’ll keep pursuing it, one way or another, even if that means that I have to push on without you both, or even if it comes down to the possibility that you turn your backs on me…

“Dead” son, or alive daughter? 

Think about it; take the all time you need. 

Please respect my decision that I don’t want to discuss it without a therapist."	"[removed]

Best ways to be supportive?	"Hi all! I'm a cis woman and my fiance is currently transitioning. She's on hormones now and she and i are working on building up her wardrobe with cute stuff and I'm teaching her how to do her makeup. She and i have been together for 7 years, although she just came out about 2 months ago. I'm so happy she can be herself now and the happiness i see in her makes me so so thrilled!!

The issue is she came out in kinda a big, explosive way. I love her with all my heart, but it had some repercussions in both my family and her work place. Luckily the family stuff is being worked through, but for a while I was grieving them because I thought I would have to cut them out.. my family and I are close but if I had to i would choose my partner in a heartbeat. 

She works in a very toxic masculine field. Almost everyone who works there is an over 40 cis-white-man. She decided to confide in some people there and that, along with her official coming out, has unfortunately caused major issues. She is now being verbally assaulted by the customers almost daily, sexually harassed, and grabbed. She still presents masc at work but that didn't help. Her boss and coworkers haven't done anything either. 

It's breaking my heart when she comes home broken like this. She gets so depressed and upset (rightfully so, it's honestly horrific) and i don't know how to help her. She starts talking about if my family knew what was happening at work they'd want her gone even more. I don't want to get into exactly what happened with them as it'd be too identifiable, but while I know they weren't exactly comfortable with her, that was never the issue. They were worried for me because of what I would have to deal with, like safety walking with her down the street or emotionally if it was too much for me. I don't agree at all with what they did and I don't think I'm ever going to truly forgive them for what they made her feel, but it was never about her transitioning. But she won't believe that and I don't know what to do.

We're working on getting her another job, obviously, but we can't survive on just my income. I try so hard to be there for her but I don't know what else I can do. I can't make her believe my family cares for her, I can't stop her workplace from being hell on earth, and it seems like any suggestions I have for making her feel better are turned down. 

Please if anyone can offer any advice.. I need her to be happy again. Her being herself has been amazing but it's killing me to see it become a source of pain."	"Depending on where you live, your fiancée may have legal recourse. I would look up laws for country or locality where you live to see if workplace discrimination like you’ve described is against the law. If it is, I would encourage your fiancée to carefully document all acts of harassment. I would notify the company that they are in violation of whichever laws are in place, and that if the discrimination is not addressed then legal action will be pursued.

Thank you for being supportive. There are countless transgender people who lose support once they've come out - the time they need support and love the most. It's really a tough journey filled with a lot of unknowns. Just letting her know that you have her back should help tremendously. As trans women, many of us have grown up always feeling like we don't fit in with our birth gender and are somehow ""letting everyone down"" by not living up to the masculine ideal. It breeds a lot of fundamental insecurities and self-hatred that presents many ongoing challenges.

I guess I would recommend redoubling efforts to find another job. I know in my city there is an LGBTQ business focused group. There might be one in your city, and networking with them might prove beneficial. If you find a similar business that is run by a LGBTQ person or is expressly friendly to them, it might be a good opportunity.

I don't know what business she's in, but many professional organizations now are actively looking to increase their minority representation, and from what I understand a transgender person fits that description. So I don't think it would hurt to ask. I always believe in turning lemons into lemonade. I know a trans woman who was in a male dominated field as well. She started transitioning and very soon started a successful business consulting with other businesses about being inclusive with their transgender employees, almost always via Zoom.
Thank you for the link! I've told her to start documenting things, but she thinks that unless she has proof it happened like an email from her boss that it won't help. I'll keep trying though!
People are horrific. Thank you for your support though 😊 we're definitely job hunting for her and have some good prospects... it's just in the mean time she has to deal with all of this. Thank you though!
Thank you!! I didn't know that LGBTQ business groups existed, I'll definitely look into that! Unfortunately the company she works for is extremely conservative. Like, to a point that it's ridiculously gender based. But the couple of places she's applied to are definitely more on the accepting side so I have my fingers crossed! Thank you 😊
I’m not a lawyer, so I don’t know what is sufficient. Your local ACLU chapter may be able to give you more information https://www.aclu.org/know-your-rights/lgbtq-rights#can-an-employer-discriminate-against-me-because-of-my-sexual-orientation-or-gender-identity

The threat of legal action may be enough to get your fiancée’s workplace to understand that such harassment to her is unacceptable. But if it’s not, I would encourage you to do everything in your power to keep them accountable.

It’s a very scary situation for her. I am sorry she is facing such hate and transphobia from her coworkers.
That's so helpful thank you!! I really appreciate the resources!!"	xrkw05	trans	10	0.92	2022-09-29 22:26:32
Coming out to parents...	"The only people I have come out to are my closest friends and this summer I plan on telling my parents.
But I won't talk directly to them or send them a text message. I have been planning this, let's call it a letter, with my point of view of all my life. I wrote everything I can remember from my childhood to now and then I started talking about the LGBTQ+ community and how I am part of it. For safety I also wrote something about my situation as a trans person's and some curiosities and facts.

I hope and wait for the best, but I'm nervous and don't know what to expect from them. I'm aware of some of their opinions on this topic.

Let's see what comes out of it....."	"I hope it goes well!

1 year and 3 months of HRT	"- This started out as a small text about HRT and turned into a big diary about the last few months 😅

Hey all! Felt like celebrating my 1 year and 3 month celebration with more than just myself 😅. I'm 20 now and while I'm not quite living the dream (yet), I'm getting there! I don't need antidepressants and therapy just to *survive* anymore. I've gone from surviving to actually living and it's wonderful. 
It wasn't all smooth sailing though, that's for sure. I lost the person I called Mom along the way, replaced by a zealot who trashed my clothes and my pills numerous times, before eventually having her macho boyfriend ""escort"" (violence; physical assault >! I did get physically assaulted before I could leave the house. Ended up losing a toenail to his work boots, multiple bruises, a busted up lip, and a bruise around my neck from a chokehold!<) me out of the house while she watched. Hell, even the police didn't do anything after I called them and they got there, guess I shouldn't have been surprised since I'm living in the South. But you know what? Even a thundercloud has a silver lining. With absolutely no idea what to do, I ended up calling my estranged father and ~~maybe while bawling my eyes out~~ told him what had just happened. And you know what? Halfway through that phone call he dropped what he was doing and drove over to pick me up and brought me to his place, telling me I could live with him for a while. I was hugging the heck out of him while bawling when he asked me if I was wearing a bra and taking pills. I remember going full panic and trying not to make it apparent, but looking back I guess it was pretty obvious given that I'm B-cup 😅. I'll never forget that he told me ""It doesn't matter"" and hugged me tighter. This was late August/early October. These days, things couldn't be better. I can't put it into words how much of a relief it is not having to fear for my safety 24/7. Not having to life with the fear of coming home one day to find my room torn up and my things gone. I'm living happily with my younger brothers and my dad for now, while I save for college! I'm slowly showing more and more of my true self to my family here, slowly gaining more courage. I've gotten pretty close to wearing a dress in front of family a few times! I feel a lot better having shared all this too 💜
No matter how bleak your situation is, or how hopeless it seems, there's always hope... And there's always people who will accept you for who you are 💜"	"That’s a rough road you traveled. I’m really sorry that happened. 

Happy to hear you’re in a safe place, and focused on a brighter future! Also super happy your dad came thru for you. Stay strong! Sounds like you’re in a great position for a reboot.
all my support, stay strong <3
It's most definitely a wonderful change 💚

Still in the process of slowly rebuilding my wardrobe again!
Luckily my hoodie collection was spared!
I’m 11 months into HRT, and my body has been changing so much I’m reluctant to invest in a new wardrobe. Stuff I bought a year ago doesn’t fit me anymore. I’m trying my best to be patient tho.
I feel you on that! I've had to donate quite a few of my clothes cause they don't fit anymore. On one hand I hate having to donate said clothes... But on the other hand I love not being able to fit in them anymore cause it's an example of how far I've come. It's a complex love-hate relationship"	10ypb16	trans	11	1.0	2023-02-10 11:09:09
I’m scared and angry and I’ve got nowhere else to say it.	"Hi there. This is my first post on any trans subreddits mainly because I’ve been too afraid to say anything and I’ve been really busy, but here goes nothing.

My name is Alyssa (she/her) and I’ve slowly been coming out to friends and getting advice from some of the people in my friend group who happen to be trans themselves so I can hopefully start to transition once I get away from my family, who I’ve avoided telling. I can’t say a word to most of my family in conversation in case I accidentally start an argument or cause them to start ranting about the LGBTQ+ community. They’re just the worst in general where anything political is concerned. They have some very strong opinions about trans people in particular and they love to bring up all kinds of stuff from all the “debunks” to some really fucked up experiments done by some weirdo under the guise of research (having looked up what happened, it genuinely makes me want to vomit), claiming that trans people support forced transitions and being trans is an ideology built on child abuse because of it. It drives me insane that I know I can’t tell them who I am or defend my views because I know I’ll get told that my views have been brainwashed into me. I never used to question it, but they started sharing some insanely bigoted stuff with me when I was 12 and that’s when I knew they were nut jobs.

Some of the stuff they’ve said is starting to get to me and it’s made me drop back into the questioning cycle of weather or not I should be who I want to be for the sake of ensuring my own safety and that my family doesn’t reject me. I’ve been dealing with this while I’ve been revising for exams (that I literally finished yesterday), which makes me even more worried because I feel like I’ve messed on a few of them and I won’t be able to get into uni, which would be a place where I would likely be able to start transitioning.

I’m constantly paranoid of what other people will think of me if I come out or if somebody outs me because some people see trans women as predators or freaks, even though I haven’t even started to properly socially transition yet and know that the people who I’ve come out to (hopefully) wouldn’t out me. It pisses me off that people see being trans as a precursor to becoming one of the worst kinds of criminals or, even worse, as a crime in itself and I just don’t understand why. All of this paranoia hangs over my head like a dark cloud and makes me feel hopeless and like my life could come crashing down at the drop of a hat.

Everything seems so uncertain and just want to curl up in a dark corner somewhere and cry because I know that if I try to come out and socially transition, there’s a good chance I’ll end up getting dragged back into the closet kicking and screaming. I’ve been avoiding mirrors because I hate how I look and I don’t like to speak because my voice is so low when I’m not being femme in secret (which basically never happens because my parents would catch me). I’ve basically destroyed what social life I used to have because I can’t be myself in public without fear of being harassed about it. The only times I genuinely feel happy is when I’m home alone, where I’m free to be myself without raising any eyebrows because I’m talking high pitched or wearing a tartan skirt and when I can be open about being trans to somebody and not tread around the subject like it’s a minefield or a sleeping dragon.

I feel lost and so angry at the world and it’s reduced me from a semi-social person to a sleep deprived gargoyle who depends on video games to escape from their worries."	"It's very easy to be GnC and hide the fact you're trans. Even in queerphobic places. Because they view trans people as *other*. And not as *you*

But you're at the age of moving out of your parents house. Even if you don't make Uni, there's always more options at your disposal. Working at a coffee shop while pursuing higher education for example. Or learning and practicing a trade while pursuing higher education. All viable options.

When you've got time to yourself to figure out *you* you'll figure it out. It'll be Ok.
I was thinking of what jobs I could get over summer to earn a bit of cash to spend on some clothes I want, but I don’t think I ever. I could get a tech support job for somewhere to troubleshoot computers, which is right up my street since all I do when I’m not playing video games is code stuff as a hobby. I just have to hope that I can find a place that would be ok with me if I started to transition just in case I don’t get into uni.

And you’re right about my family seeing people they dislike as “the others”. They’ve said “you’ll never be a part of LGBTQ+ because you’re one of us” in so many different ways that I can’t count. I assume it’s because they expected me to share their beliefs, which they no I don’t, so they try to convince me I’m just falling for some big conspiracy that they believe is happening. The way they go about doing it is rather aggressive, but they still believe I trust them. 

I needed to hear someone else tell me things will be ok after all I’ve heard from my family and the downward spiral my mind’s been in in the past week. Thank you so much for being that someone."	vkj4jb	trans	10	0.92	2022-06-25 16:49:04
I feel like bras are my safety blanket	Having smaller boobs I probably don’t need that much support, but wearing bras gives me that safety feeling like a warm hug. My boobs have been hurting like crazy going from sharp pains to sensitive nipples to feeing like I put icey hot on them. So wearing the bras has helped with some of that pain as well. Can anyone else relate to the warm hug?!	"YUSS!! Isn't it interesting?

It really goes to show just how much of an impact hormones have on the body.
When I got my first bra it did feel exactly like getting a hug! When I told my brother that I loved wearing it, he said I was the first woman he's known that didn't enjoy taking it off.
That's pretty sick! Do you get any itchiness or other things you notice?

I'm still growing~ but one of the things I noticed was just HOW awesome it feels to have something warm to cuddle with. Never had that until moodiness set in (proceeded by buds after three days)
The crazy part about my situation is that I have gyno that gave me natural 36B boobs and I’m not even on hormones. Despite not being on hormones I still have all the pain like my boobs are growing. I can’t imagine if I did start E of what that would look like 😳
Oh for sure. Sometimes itchy but the thing I notice more is nipple sensitivity. Not wearing a bra they will rub and although it feels good, I still need a barrier. Most of the time I can’t wear bras since I’m not transitioning yet and I just want to cover them up and keep them in check with the safety blanket.
You made my day~

Thank you for sharing!

I was forced to come out as trans and it turned out okay, but I'm still upset	"My mom and I were arguing bc she wanted to put my son in church and I was trying to explain to her that I wasn't comfortable with putting him there but she wouldn't take no for an answer. So I told her I was trans and that with the current political climate and how christianity has been playing such a huge role in influencing my safety and livelihood I just felt it wasn't a great time for my son to be put somewhere where he'll get told that ppl like me and his dad are evil.

She did a 180. She called me her son and completely accepted me and said she understood. I'm incredibly happy that she accepts me, but I hate that it took me saying that for her to take no for an answer."		11ws364	trans	9	0.77	2023-03-20 19:00:42
Is it controversial to say that “trans people(specially those in America) should arm themselves”?	"Most of you probably know how many anti trans bills are being passed in the United States, most of you have also probably heard about the 10 stages of genocide and how trans people are already on step 7.

Trans people have been victims of violence for a long time now. If our countries won’t protect us, if our own police will not be of help, how can we protect ourselves?

I am hugely in favor of gun regulation and I in no way think that everybody should have a gun, but if we live in a world where the people hunting us have guns and know how to use them and we don’t, that’s clearly not good for us. So I do think trans people should arm themselves and learn how to use them.

But remember, only use it if there’s no other option, right wing media won’t threat you like they treated Kyle Rittenhouse, but your safety and happiness is what matters most.

Let me hear your thoughts in the comments! Stay safe, stay happy, stay proud."	"I would make the argument that if you think you'd be safer with a gun, carry a knife. Buttt, if you're in a rural region such as I, ya DEFINITELY need to carry a gun. No one realizes how easy it is to make people,  transwomen especially, disappear.
Look, if it makes you feel safer to have a gun, then by all means, do so. But I personally, have seen enough of guns to last me a lifetime and the only person I'm likely to use it on is me. It's not a thing everyone can just have
Glances over at my medical bag, body armor, and firearms. Yeah, totally havent been convinced for years that the far right is going to come after us. I will defend myself by any means necessary and will not go silently.
We need to not only arm ourselves, but organize.  We’re a lot less vulnerable with other armed trans people a phone call away.
i wish there were no need for firearms. and i wish there was no more school shootings.

unfortunately, the combination of an enormous amount of firearms in the US (quite often owned by those who specifically hate trans people) and the violent rhetoric towards trans people in the US, that i will not be giving up my firearms anytime soon.
the only problem i have with this sentiment is it kind of ignores the fact that, even if you have guns, the government has bombs. tanks. nukes. the whole nine yards. there’s so many historical examples of groups that the government hated that Were armed that still got slaughtered by the government (great example could be the ‘MOVE’ civil rights group, a black civil rights group that had their compound and entire block blown up with C4 by the police, at the request of the government. they had guns, they had man power, but the government wanted them dead so they were killed).
I agree, not everyone should have a gun
I agree that ideally no one would have guns, but that’s not the reality we live in, the people who want to kill us have guns and we have nothing to defend ourselves with
I wasn’t thinking of protecting ourselves from the government with them, that’s not the main threat right now. I think guns would prevent other civilians from coming after us, like hate groups for instance. It’s not unheard of that trans people get followed home and such.
We don't need to worry about the government coming after us, we need to worry about paramilitary groups like the Proud Boys coming after us, at least in the near term. I'm also pretty sure the federal government or even a state using ""bombs, tanks, nukes"" on their own people in 2023 would draw just *a little* reaction from the world.

Edit: Also, in this scenario you predict happening, is your solution to just die without a fight? Fuck that."	11s6ma3	trans	12	0.76	2023-03-15 19:30:16
Mom needing advice	"Reddit has never let me down for advice and this group has helped with many indirect issues we have encountered. (Like sweating off estradiol patches). I thought this might be the best place to ask. 

I have a cis daughter with congenital pituitary issues. Her most obvious symptom was a lack of growth hormone. Since she was approaching puberty she was given a blocker to allow her time to grow. Worked great she made it up to 5’ from 4’8”.  Now she is on estradiol patches (her amazing endocrinologist did give her a choice and we live in Texas) to get her back on the puberty path since it wasn’t really starting on it’s own. This probably would have happened anyway with or without the blocker. 

During this process she has told me she is not straight. I pretty much always knew this because she was nothing like her sisters that showed a definite preference even as toddlers. 

The only thing I have ever said that might be less than 100% positive is that I wanted her to not completely wrap her identity in one thing or another until she actually makes it through puberty. Since we are manipulating her hormones I am concerned she gets to the other side and when she is back to just her own biological hormones she might feel differently and it is hard to let go of a personal perception you have had for a long time if you discover it isn’t accurate. 

My biggest concern is she is identifying as non binary and asexual. That’s fine but once through puberty there is a decent chance she will not feel the same way. 

I’m hoping this is a large enough group that there might be someone who used a blocker prior to hormone therapy that could give me some advice. 

Once you made it through your chosen puberty did you still feel the same way you did before puberty especially if you had felt asexual prior? Did you at some point with adult hormone levels decide, “hey, that person makes me feel all hot and bothered”? If you did in fact develop different preferences was it difficult to adapt to the change? What could have helped with the process? 

I’ve tried asking about this in some of the online hormone/pituitary groups I am in but most parents are terrified to talk about anything because the treatment is basically the same as for trans kids. They don’t want to become targets. I get it but damn. It’s because the treatment is the same I go out of my way to educate as many people as possible about the safety and known effectiveness of treatment. (Particularly, puberty blockers.) Some people just don’t want to know the truth but I’ve gotten enough people asking me questions that give me hope. 

Thanks in advance."	"I can't comment on the hormones, not at that age. 

I can comment on the fact that it's really invalidating to be told, ""okay, but you'll probably change your mind later."" Often, when people double-down on an incorrect identity, it's because others have forced them to defend that identity for so long, they don't want to admit those people were right. Those people made them feel like crap. They caused spirals of doubt and shame that lasted for years. If those people were right all along? That hurts. 

It's a lot better to just keep an open dialogue. Let your kid ""have phases"" without calling them phases or doubting their current feelings on the matter. Support whatever's going on in the moment, so they never feel like they have to defend what they are or build something up like that. Leave space for fluidity by letting them be.

The more you doubt and question and forcibly remind your kid that ""oh, well, it might change later!"" the more your kid hears, ""I don't think you know who you are or what you want, so don't try to tell me about it."" The more your kid is going to think, ""I *must* be this, just to prove that my feelings are real,"" even if those feelings change, later. 

You demonstrate for your child how to react to change. Right now. When they tell you things like this. If you don't care, it's all fine, you're just glad they're happy? There's a much higher chance that they'll respond to any future change by not caring, because it's all fine, you're just glad they're happy. If you respond right now by saying, ""Nah, I bet you're wrong, I can't accept that,"" then what have you modeled? That they should respond to change by saying, ""No, that's not right, I can't accept that.""
I dont mean this rudely so if it comes off that way I'm sorry but even if it does change later on what's the harm in accepting what they say at face value and supporting them now if they turn out to be fully straight later you'll be the loving mom who allowed them room to explore and find themselves and if they turn out not to be you're still the cool mom who was there for them when they needed love and understanding the most. I will never understand the cishet mindset of absolutes you're one or the other and the moment you say it it's in stone if they say they arent straight roll with it and if it changes roll with it the only way you can lose in this situation is to fight them and make them struggle my advice is just be there for your kid and dont sweat the labels too much
These are valid concerns don't worry! I am a 14 non-binary person, only out as bisexual to my parents. My parents told me they love me no matter what, even if I change labels I'm still the same person. It made me so happy to be unconditionally loved. And yes hormones do sometimes play a part in it, but isn't it better to accept your child now and make them feel loved, than reject them and make them feel unloved later in life, even if they change labels again?

You also mentioned your child is non-binary? From what I can tell you are okay with this but you are not sure how to go around the whole pronouns thing, and you also said you have a ""cis daughter"" which is not true. No hate you are new to this let me just give you some advice, from a non-binary teen.

Practicing pronouns in text is a lot easier than in person, so if you were to start using their they/them pronouns in the comments it will already feel a little easier. Also, they/them is both singular AND plural, that's the beauty of it. ""Someone left **their** wallet here, I'll call the number to get it back to **them**."" ""Bob is running late, **their** car broke down"".

Making mistakes is okay, don't let anyone tell you otherwise. As long as you try, it does not matter. But don't get annoyed when they correct you. You are doing great though, good luck with the advice your getting!!
Same for the hormones at that time, I can’t comment on it, but what I do know is that I hated my first puberty as I knew very early I wished I was a girl, what confused me during puberty was also like girls, I mean I didn’t know being a lesbian was even a thing.  Not even knowing about transgender people I just made the best of it and left my desires to be a woman as a fantasy or something to secretly dream about.  

As for changing preferences after puberty, no the desire to be a woman was stronger and depressing as my body had developed into a man…. My sexual preference didn’t change during my first puberty but during my second I started to look at guys differently after about two years.  Some of that was definitely my looks changing and liking the way men treated me…. I even had dreams of men, mainly just Ryan Reynolds lol.  So I tried dating men, but even while liking the way a guy treated me on a date, I’d see a pretty woman walk into the room and wish I was on a date with her.  

My only advice is to not factor in the sexual preferences for attraction and just keep being supportive of the “identity “ parts of your child.  

*I personally hate to say “I identify as” because I am and always have wished and been a woman in my mind and spirit. Non binary people are a mystery to me because my desire to be a woman was strong from the beginning, im not sure there is a set standard for how they feel or what the right hormone/puberty they want to have.
something you need to remember is that gender and attraction have almost nothing to do with each other. the fact that they say they’re asexual and non binary are completely different. both might be affected by puberty but it’s unlikely in my experience. what might happen is that puberty will help them find who they really are. many people will find themselves better as they get older and get better informed and learn about themselves. personally i went from straight male-bicurious male-bi male-pansexual male-pansexual non binary-pansexual trans woman, in about 7 years. people are always finding themselves and puberty may or may not help them expose that in themselves. some people take 50 or more years. there’s no real time period for finding your true self.

edit- kinda rambling but i hope some of that makes sense
I think that's a valid concern since hormones play a good part in your body. She might change her mind and she also might not. As someone who went through a lot of different labels, I'd never want to tell you how to raise your kids, but if I was her I'd appreciate my parent respecting and treating me as my current identity but also reassuring me that it is okay to change my mind and that they'll respect my ""future"" identity if I do, and if I don't change my mind that is okay too. Good luck :)
Wow, I really appreciate this. I did only say it once and have just tried to keep any thoughts to myself. It’s hard to have perspective when you truly care about your kids. I know I have been guilty of trying to protect her only to realize it wasn’t actually helpful. I would never want her to feel like I don’t value her feelings. Thank you.
I don’t see that as rude at all. That’s pretty much how I’m acting, just letting her know I will always be here with unconditional love. Just figured it never hurts to seek information from others to have a plan if there are future bumps in the road so I don’t cause harm. Life is hard enough on it’s own.
Thanks for this. You seem much more aware than many 14 year olds. I see a bright future ahead of you. I’m glad you have a loving home. 

I can see the benefit of using pronouns writing. It’s not like I actually address them directly with any pronoun.
Thank you for sharing so much. In a lot of ways I think it would be easier for me to get my mind around this if it was just she felt a certain way and that was that. Not knowing if it is a result of a medical condition (they have congenital pituitary issues)makes me question everything. I really don’t care who they like or how they see themself but worry that once we make it through this part it could be traumatic if she no longer identifies the same way. Does she feel asexual because she lacks a working pituitary? Once she gets to the point she has her reproductive system working will it change and possibly be overwhelming due to an influx of hormones she has never experienced before. 

I guess I’m just trying to make sure I’m prepared for any possibility, even if I know I could never anticipate every possibility. Talking to your children is awkward under normal circumstances. The unknowns make this even more so. I just don’t want to have a knee jerk reaction in the future to make her think anything about how she feels is wrong. I am terrible at masking my emotions and have inadvertently had a split second reaction that wasn’t in line with how I really feel that has caused pain to others, no matter how much I try to explain. This is far to important to not at least try to prepare for as many possibilities as I can.
I get it. I once described sexuality like ice cream. Some like vanilla, some chocolate and some prefer swirl. Now I realize it’s much more Ben and Jerry with flavor combos I had never dreamed of. It’s also hard for me personally to understand as I was always very sexual and her older siblings (all adults) are very (responsibly) sexual as well. Luckily, I am not afraid to learn new things. In the end I just want her healthy and as happy as possible.
I knew this was the right place to ask. I think I get stuck in the medical effects of dealing with manipulating her hormones I lose sight that since they are only 16 there will be wildly fluctuating changes no matter what. My oldest daughter was planning on being a roadie and living in a van at that point in her life and now she works in the legal department for an oil and gas company. 

As a parent I accept I’m going to screw things up from time to time but I really try to make sure it’s not the mistakes that cause lasting damage. Lol
Cool I just know I have a tendency to be rather blunt and sometimes that's not always taken the way I mean
What I mean by in text is what you did just then. “It’s not like I actually address THEM”. When talking about them, in messages to your friends (assuming they want you to tell people, don’t tell people without their permission) use they/them, it will feel more natural.
what are they’re pronouns?
I came to this sub because I knew I’d hear truth from people who have similar experiences. It’s ok to be blunt. What’s the saying - you’re not responsible for how others interpret what you say. Unfortunately too many people interpret things defensively. I have mad respect for anyone on this sub because it means you have the courage and value yourself enough to seek information and a greater understanding (and camaraderie) from people going through similar circumstances. Knowledge is power.
I was just informed the other day (like two days ago)  it is they/them. I am not used to it yet. I keep forgetting and having been raised by grammar police it is hard to use a plural pronoun for a singular person. I’ve been avoiding it this weekend by just using her (new) name. I’m sure I’ll get used to using it and it will be fine. I’m glad she’s my youngest so she gets much more undivided attention.
they/ them is not only plural. it’s also very much singular. such as “oh shoot, diane left the pie here, they are so forgetful.”"	y04b5i	trans	10	0.92	2022-10-10 03:29:18
My Coming Out Journey, or: How I Learned to Fly	"Hey all!

I've wanted to accomplish more personal writing now that I'm out of college, and one of the first things I ended up finishing was a short essay about how I came to realize I was trans and began transitioning. I wanted to share it with you all, too.

Something I am fully aware of is that none of us has the exact same experiences as another of us, this is just how my experience through life was before and has been since starting hormone therapy. I’ve been very fortunate, and I acknowledge the privileges I’ve had that other trans men and women don’t. The strength and courage I’ve seen from others here on reddit and on other platform is truly awe inspiring.

Definitely let me know what you think; I love reading comments and constructive criticism! And if you like my writing, I bought my own domain name for my blog where I'm going to be posting more stuff later, but it'll be a little less heavy. Find me at [mscoffeesq.com](https://mscoffeesq.com)

Okay, no more further ado:

# My Coming Out Journey, or: How I Learned to Fly

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

For a very long time I was unhappy, and I never really knew why.

Let me rephrase; for a very long time I was unhappy, and I refused to acknowledge why.

I still don’t quite know when or how the thought first entered my head, but sometime around elementary school I’d first wondered what it would have been like if I’d been born a girl instead. Curiosity plagued me for years, and I’d often have vivid dreams of a world where a girl stood in my place. She was so like me, but different in many ways; for one thing, she was happy. When I was a child, even as recent as it was in the grand scheme, there were no public figures or characters I knew that were trans, so I had no word, no name, no idea to put on what I was feeling. And so I did my best to ignore it, but I became more unhappy.

As I moved into adolescence, my unhappiness turned to depression. I had trouble picturing a future for myself, and struggled to find anything to care about. I hated looking in the mirror most of the time; I hated what puberty was doing to my body; I hated having my picture taken; I hated myself, without really knowing why.

No.

I knew why.

I sought out stories and media that revolved around the characters transforming in some way - into superheroes, into animals, and especially into the opposite sex. I almost always chose to play female characters in games. I always wrote it off as just wanting a change of pace; wanting to try something new; an escape from my own life. I just never admitted that I wished it could be a permanent escape.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Eventually, I graduated, and found myself in the Navy, serving my country while earning a living and hoping to eventually go to college. The “Don’t Ask, Don’t Tell” policy was repealed in 2011, two years after I joined. The world was barely starting to accept people for who they loved; would they ever accept who I knew, but didn’t want to say, I wanted to be? In 2013, while visiting and drinking with my best friends, I broke down crying. I admitted to them out loud what until then I’d never dared let leave my lips: “I wish I was a girl.”

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Being in the military, though, and being in a job that had zero tolerance for anything considered a mental illness, for stability and safety on the job (hell, you couldn’t even drink energy drinks, because they had a chance to impair your ability), I kept it to myself, and soldiered on. However, I’ll never forget the first time a dear, dear friend of mine helped me with my makeup, assured me of how beautiful I looked in a dress, and was there for me as I attempted an experiment. We went to see Beauty and the Beast on stage, which was fitting I think; a story about appearances being deceiving, and it being what’s on the inside that counts. I had fun, but was a bundle of nerves and self consciousness, fearing that every eye on me was one of judgement. I should have taken baby-steps, instead I jumped straight into the deep end without any support. I was too afraid; I’d tried to fly before I could even walk. So it all went into a box, and I went back into denial. The year was 2013.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

It just so happened that, when I returned to my parents’ house after I left the service, we happened to be living across the street from a person who seemed to be going through their own transition. I never got to know this person, so I don’t want to assume their story, but they appeared to be an older person transitioning from male to female. I couldn’t begin to imagine what they were going through; they seemed like a solitary person who didn’t interact with the outside world. We’d speak to their wife and other family living there, but nothing was ever said nor asked about them. My family would crack jokes and make comments about them, not understanding what transphobia was and that the comments they made could be hurtful to a trans person who heard them. I would laugh, but it was the empty, hollow laughter of someone crying on the inside. And I’d retreat a little further inwardly.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

Romantic relationships always seemed to be held back by my inability to connect with my partner physically. The hatred and disgust I felt with my own body made it difficult to be intimate, and I can’t help but fear, even now, that my personal hang-ups made my partners feel that I didn’t find them attractive. The dreams persisted - small rays of sunshine in an otherwise gloomy life I was choosing to live - but I continued on, growing more and more depressed as the years ticked on; though there were times through the years where the mask would slip again. It wasn’t until I joined the online dating scene, and went on my first date with a trans woman that the mask began to  crack. 

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

She was beautiful, smart, funny, but mostly so confident. I’ll always regret what a nervous wreck I was that night. A few years later, I met another girl in one of my classes. I never would have guessed she was trans, until she told me. She was gorgeous, and I was enamored. But, also, I was ever so slightly envious. Sadly, neither relationship lasted long, but I came away from each with fractures in my facade. I began to wonder, did I want to be with women I found attractive? Or did I want to be them? Of course, deep down, I knew.

In 2019, I started joining LGBT+ spaces online. I wanted to be supportive, but, also. . .

With each circle I joined I was exposed to more and more people finding their truth and happiness, all the while I was still living with a cloud over my head. In 2020, I discovered a space called ‘r/egg_irl’. An “egg”, I discovered, was a trans person who didn’t realize they were, or was in denial about being transgender. And I realized that I related to every joke and story that was posted there so much. While the country was descending into madness, I was going on a journey of self discovery and realization. Of course, it all made sense: I was an egg! A trans person who wasn’t ready to admit they were. But, I was afraid. What would my family think? What dangers would I face if I followed this thread?


I found myself at a crossroads. Down one path, the road I was on already, was safety, assurance, but also sadness and regret. Down the other, well. . . the road was mysterious; winding; frightening; exciting. And it ended with a cliff. A leap of faith. I realize now that I couldn’t choose who I was inside; I could only choose between happiness, or misery. I knew what I had to do.

I took a breath.

I leaped.

My first visit for a Hormone Replacement Therapy consultation was nerve wracking. I decided to go through Planned Parenthood. I sat in a lobby with a few other women, worrying about what they thought I was doing there. What if this was a mistake? What if I didn’t really belong here? All fears left me when I met my doctor. She was so kind, so caring, and she didn’t even bat an eye, or second guess me at all when I said what I wanted. It made me wonder why I second guessed myself at all. I knew what I wanted.

&amp;amp;amp;#x200B;

I started telling my closest friends and family, and the outpouring of support was overwhelming. I was so worried about being judged, hated, and feared, I hadn’t stopped to realize how supporting, caring, and loving the group of people I’ve chosen to let into my life could and would be. It’s been a few months now, and I finally begin to see a person in the mirror I don’t hate, and I actually enjoy being in pictures now. It’s like the clouds have finally parted, and the little rays have become a full shining sky. My family and friends continue to give me confidence to know I’ve made the right choice, and act as my wings on this amazing journey I’ve decided to take. And sure, every now and then we may pass a dark cloud; the skies can be rough and treacherous out here, and sometimes an angry little thundercloud will rumble and try to knock me down, but I know I can rise above it. I spent a long time running and hiding from who I wanted to be, and those days are far behind me.

My name is Mason Coffe.

I’m a trans woman.

Watch me soar. 🕊"	"This was beautiful! Thank you for sharing your story with us 🥰
Amazing story. I connected with alot of the things you said. Being unable to connect with a partner, not knowing if I was attracted to other trans people even though I knew deep down that's who I am. Hell, I was in the navy too. Much like you I leaped and finally accepted myself and although some people in my life aren't accepting, the vast majority of people close to me from the navy and friends before that have been amazing. I started HRT 3 weeks ago and even though the changes are small so far, I know I'm making the right choice. Congratulations on finding yourself, I know how hard that internal struggle of accepting it can be. Keep moving forward and being your true self girl, you deserve it! ❤️
Thank you for writing this, I’m just barely starting my journey, but I see so many parallels between us that I know I’m on the right path. I was a submariner at roughly the same time frame and my first interaction with trans women was in Hawaii, where they seem to have been more accepted. After finding this community and especially the dysphoria bible I finally feel like I understand myself so much better. I’m looking into VA resources to start my transition. It’s intimidating but thanks to reading stories like yours I’m ready to be myself ♥️ thank you so much
Thank you for reading it 💚
Nice to see a trans shipmate 😄 Congratulations to you, too!
When I initially came out on social media to friends and family, I’d asked that those who didn’t approve or couldn’t be supportive to kindly remove themselves from my life; definitely noticed a few less friends, but their loss. Same goes for the people who don’t accept you: they don’t deserve you 💚 At 6 months I’m not very far ahead of you, but speaking from experience it’ll only get better.
Congratulations! I hope they’re able to take good care of you. I realize now that I was probably making a big deal about this at the time, but when I started questioning the only major trans people I knew of who were trans were Caitlyn Jennifer and Chelsea Manning, neither of whom were taken seriously or talked about well by people I was around (I think Chelsea’s great, but at the time her labels among the military were trans and traitor). 
And thank you for reading! 💚"	mcvafg	trans	10	0.72	2021-03-25 10:40:40
Hi I'm Eve mtf 23 new here and excited to get to know everybody	New to reddit, new to transitioning, realized I'm a woman a bit over six months ago and trying to figure out where I fit into the world. I would love to have some other trans people to talk to about things especially because I don't know any irl. I live in a small town in Missouri so for my personal safety and job security I've yet to socially transition but I'm hopeful for the future and if I'm lucky I'll be starting hrt in the next few weeks; can't wait to get to know some of you and learn more about my new community.	"Welcome queen! I'm just realizing myself! The only important thing to really know about the community is that we love the Ikea shark /s
Hi Eve! I'm Taylor (MtF 33). Welcome!

I also don't know a lot of trans people irl and am looking to make friends online. Would love to chat! Feel free to DM me if that's comfortable for you 🙂
Hi, im from TN. Experimenting with femboy but having egg moments about ftm.

Is it a bad idea to transition with no support?	I’m MtF, 29 years old and have no support group at all. I would be going into this completely alone. I’m mostly concerned for my own safety. I moved into a new home recently and don’t know the town too well yet. So far, I don’t think that it’s an unsafe neighborhood. People here seem friendly and I do see some LGBT flags while I walk my dog. But I know that’s no true indicator of the town.	"I think that a support group during transition us important. If you can't get a physical one I'd suggest making friends online. Talking to other trans folks could help.
Recommend a therapist at least. Find one you like, may take a few to find the right one. I wish you the best with journey.
If you have money, good insurance, and ridiculous strength then you could conceivably do it. But I’d strongly recommend having someone you can turn to when feeling overwhelmed."	vatp86	trans	10	1.0	2022-06-12 19:42:44
Update to coming out to my mom	"Here is the previous post I made last night : 

https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/vntvvf/i_came_out_as_transmtf_to_my_mom_and_she_wants_to/?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share


To update, it didn't go well. It didn't go the way I thought at all, and she didn't disown me or anything, but it didn't go well. It started as her being concerned with my safety with where I live(Alabama isn't known for being trans friendly), how my fiance is taking this(third time I've told her my fiance knew before we started dating), then moved onto how I need a better job in an accusatory, berating tone. 

It wasn't what I expected, but I kind of wish I hadn't said anything. The only upside is I can stop pretending at least, but I won't be talking to her for a few weeks at least. I know she cares, but she has a messed up way of showing it that only leaves me feeling frustrated and defeated.

Happy pride month everyone, I hope your coming outs in the future go better than what I went through."	Oh man that sucks, I really hope that you don't have to deal with her much in the future!	vojzlh	trans	9	0.86	2022-06-30 21:53:52
If you support trans women being sent to male prisons you support rape	Nikita Dragun was sent to a male prison and it’s so ridiculous. I don’t care about your personal feelings, every study done shows no evidence of trans women being more dangerous to cis Woman in prison than cis woman are. However, there is mountains of evidence that trans women are subjected to rape at disproportionately high rates in male prisons. I don’t even like Nikita but person feelings about someone shouldn’t mean someone to be put in danger. This isn’t about politics. This is about safety.	It’s absolutely backwards that trans women get sent to mens prison!	yrn7jy	trans	9	0.84	2022-11-10 18:13:57
So I’m confused and upset after coming out. I have a LOT of questions.	"Hi. I’m 15 and FtM. 

So I came out to my family a week ago. And they didn’t take it well, at all.

Before even coming out, I’ve felt this way ever since I was 12, but didn’t tell anyone because my family isn’t the most welcoming with LGBT+. 

And with this quarantine, I’ve had more time to think about this. I was genderfluid, then non-binary. 

After that, I told my mom I felt more masculine but she brushed me off and told me she doesn’t think I feel like that. So I second guessed myself and told myself that I was a Demi-Girl, so that I could be somewhat feminine to not make my mom upset. 

But even then that didn’t feel right. The idea of being trans messed with me for awhile because I knew that my parents wouldn’t take it well. 

I felt disgust towards my body, I didn’t hate it, it just didn’t feel right...like something else was supposed to be there but it wasn’t there. 

So I looked up testosterone, getting a binder, top surgery, gender therapy, even looking up bottom surgery. I wanted to be sure this is what I truly wanted. Talking even makes me slightly irritated because I want my voice deeper but it’s squeaky. 

I told my therapist about it, and she fully supports me. 

When I finally told my parents, my mom said that trans is trendy, she believes I’m mixed up from my concussion. (I got that in 2016 and still have daily headaches from it), that it’s such a miracle to be a girl because I can “give life”, and I like penetration so “why would you want to be a guy??”.

That I “should have told her earlier”. 

My dad said that it’s a HARD NO, he’s not going to be Dwayne Johnson, that’s is for my “safety”, and when I’m out of his house, I can do what I want. 

But they “support me”.

They won’t allow me to get testosterone, a gender therapist, no surgeries, mom won’t buy me any masculine clothes, and when told her I was buying a binder with my own money, she looks disgusted. 

They won’t allow me to come out to family, nor will I, because both sides of our family are pretty conservative. 

They don’t ask for pronouns, so I’m getting misgendered everyday, all day. I changed my name but I can’t tell them, so I’m being dead named too. 

They do it on purpose, and won’t even try gender neutral pronouns. Even with my siblings, the youngest (13) , get mad when I correct her on my pronouns. 

And our baby nephew is living with us because of the pandemic, so I wanted to go by Nana instead of Auntie, but she’ll still call me that but get mad when I tell her to call me by Nana. 

And with his mother/my oldest sister, she tries but can’t call me by my new pronouns and name because of my parents. 

I’m lost. They’re making me question everything but I KNOW this is what I want. I feel trapped and my best friend has been my rock. 

She uses my new name and pronouns. But...it’s not enough and it’s making my mental health worse.

I can’t even pass as slightly masc because my chest size is too big, and my hips are wide. I don’t have any masculine clothes and because of the way my hair is right now, my mom makes me wear a bow around my head to make it look “presentable”, and I can’t cut my hair too short because it’ll look like a “ni**a cut”...

What should I do? It’s like they refuse to believe this is what I want. I want to leave but can’t, so ya. 

Thanks :) 

i know it’s a lot but wanted it to be detailed"	"""It's a miracle to be a girl cause you can give life"" Big yikes... Such comments are both transphobic AND sexist (not all women NEED to have kids)

Oh and eh, I'm only out as lesbian so far and I look so feminine that people don't even believe that. I would end up with a man one day, I would crave a pregnancy one day... I'm ""too young to know things""

Well I'm 22, have a decent fulltime job and don't live with my family anymore, but it doesn't get easier... You need to grow balls (no pun intented) and that's hard, really hard when most people around you are so shockingly conservative... I understand that it might come as a shock for your parents though... But no need to be so disrespectful towards you.

hi, a dysphoric enby here :)  (17 afab)

""I felt disgust towards my body, I didn’t hate it, it just didn’t feel right...like something else was supposed to be there but it wasn’t there."" 

that 100% sounds like gender/body dysphoria and i believe that you are trans, whether non-binary or a guy. i hope you know that there's nothing wrong with you, your family is just transphobic, and i'm very proud of you for trying your best to research everything to make sure you understand what you want. bind safely!!

i'm in a similar situation as you, and i personally know a lot of trans guys who are too, so you're not alone. you *could* try your best to educate your family by discussing with them, sending them articles and videos explaining what gender dysphoria and being transgender is, etc. but unfortunately some people will never change or open their minds. and if your family is abusive/violently lgbtphobic, it's better to not try to fight/convince them on this as your safety is more important. 

try searching for ""closeted trans boy/ftm tips"" to pass or at least to make you feel less dysphoric. what my friends and i used to do(before covid-19 happened) is save up on money, hang out after school, walk to stores nearby to buy clothes from the men's section, stuff them in our backpacks, then slowly add them to our wardrobe so that our family wouldn't notice; and even if they did, it's not hard to lie that it's from the women's with most things. with things like underwear, my friends with abusive transphobic parents had to hide them, wear them in secret, and do their own laundry, but it works out if you're very careful. 

last of all, you're 15. it's ***just*** 3 more years(or sooner, depending on your state laws) until you're in complete control of your own body, medical choices, everything! and you don't even have to keep in contact in them when that time comes. if you have questions or want more tips of passing, medical stuff, dysphoria, anything, lemme know :)
The miracle to give life as a girl thing is bullshit anyway. I have a newborn and I’m legally male as well as have had too surgery. I hate when people act like all women and only women can give birth.
Absolutely (and congrats!!)

Anyone with healthy female organs can give life, but no one HAS to, and if you can't or don't want to, you're not less of a woman if you identify as such.

For me, it triggers such intense dysphoria... I can't even describe it without risking a panic attack and suicidal thoughts ahaha...

Precautions for a trip to Florida	I’m a transmasc PhD student traveling to Florida for a school-related event. Do I need to take any precautions to ensure my safety? I currently look very androgynous and it’s kinda clear that I’m gender nonconforming. I’ll be there for about a week and I’m a bit scared, especially since there will most likely not be unisex bathrooms everywhere.	"If you're flying and have time get tsa precheck or global entry. 
Also, Familiarize yourself with this and take a printed copy with you:
https://www.tsa.gov/transgender-passengers


If you want to go overboard:

If your name is different you could take a copy of the court order and birth certificate


I also carry my old drivers license with me
I’m in Florida. If you are traveling to one of the major cities you’ll likely be fine. I’d be more concerned if you were in one off the more rural towns here but I imagine your school related event won’t be held in one of those.
I live in a pretty major university town in Fl. You can get away being pretty GNC. I'm nowhere near androgynous, have worn skirts out and about, and had a fine time. I see GNC people a lot around here.
I'm currently in a large city in Florida right now for vacation and I haven't run into any problems actually here. When I have to use public bathrooms (I've only done it once though), I just make my dad go in with me. You could take a friend perhaps. Also, don't be afraid to layer clothing to pass better. The people here in February are wearing multiple layers because it's cold to them.
Depends on where you're going. Orlando area's fine, most you'll probably get is a weird look from an old person but there's plenty of queers here. Most of the bigger cities, especially in central Florida, should be fine
Orlando? You’ll be fine. I can’t speak for anyone else

hrt timeline questions!! @ trans women	"hi! i’m an eighteen year old trans woman recently on hrt and i have a few questions for my queens who’ve been on hormones for at least a little while. answer all or just a few, share what you want. thanks so much. love y’all. 

- when does breast development begin and plateau? 
- fat redistribution timeline?
- what are the mental/emotional changes like?
- has your hair changed? what abt hairline?
- face changes?
- does muscle dimish? if so, how quick for you?
- is there really any way to know if you’ll pass on hrt?
- social changes? 

wishing everybody safety and well-being. much love."	"[https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/191325003256561664/498582844516466688/unknown.png](https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/191325003256561664/498582844516466688/unknown.png) here, this should kinda answer some of your questions
Hi girl im 22 mtf and 7 months now on hrt and this is my experience so far!!

- I noticed breast growth at aboyt the 2 ish month area (obviously diff for everyone) and now i can definitely see the shape feel the weight and need to wear a sports bra but im definitely still growing and constantly sore. 

- I have not noticed a ton of fat redistribution yet but i will say my butt is definitely bigger than before but that is about it. 

- For me it was by the end of the first month i was actually happy and not just faking happiness all the time and as days and months continue to pass i find myself more and more often being happier than ever before. Other emotions however are still blooming especially when it comes to crying, before I almost never cried and if i did it was a dire time usually ending with me in the hospital, now i cry at a lot but only when im by myself however it can be about the smallest things and recently (past couple weeks) i have at least been able to get emotional in front of others almost to the point of crying. Mental changes were also starting to be apparent by the end of the first month into the second and mainly towards my outlook on myself where before i was constantly doubting myself but since then and especially now with emotions and everything im a lot more confident then before wearing clothes i want to, jewelry, makeup, and perfume almost on a daily basis. On the other hand though i do have to say my dysphoria has become increasingly worse and worse with the months so i am very careful with mirrors and showering and such. 
  
- Hairline for me has not changed, but hair elsewhere has definitely. Probably was around the 3+ month mark that it was noticeable but when i shave it would come in quite a bit lighter and more soarse than before and keeps seeming to get better and take longer to grow back in. 

- My face has softened and i have had people i work with that i hadnt seen for about 5+ months say something to me about my face changing/ me looking different.

- Muscle has definitely weakened and noticeable. At my job we have boxes full of stuff that weigh around 30 lbs. Before hrt even though i didnt workout basically ever i could lift them no problem and at the start of going back about 1+ month ago it was definitely a lot harder but not impossible to do so and now i can hardly lift one without getting out of breath and needing to use our cart to help move them around. 

- Unfortunately theres no guarantee that hormones alone are going to give you the results  that you think pass especially if youre like me and unfortunately didnt go on blockers before puberty. Now this isnt to say they couldn’t give you what you think of as passing features even if you did go through puberty before everyone is different so you could end up with exactly what youll think of as passing its just not a guarantee that you will. 

- Im not sure if you mean social changes purely based on hrt or bc of the effects of hrt or of telling people. I feel that if you didnt say anything to someone thay might not notice that something i happening for a while or at all, however bc of the effects of mental and emotional change you might appear more confident or act more fem or just diff in general and that could be noticed or it could lead to you talking to someone and if youre with a person almost every day they might not notice physical changes as much whereas if you only see a person every couple of months or longer then it will probably be more noticeable. And if you end up telling people that either youre trans or trans and on hrt then they may start to act differently towards you or you around them and this can combine with if your sexuality and theirs align or if you’re attracted to them. But my experience telling people (and i have been extremely lucky that everyone i have told is very happy for me and supporting and loving) is that if they’re accepting and loving then theyll act pretty much the same around you with some added courtesy but thats not to say that that is exactly how everyone will be even if they are accepting. 

I hope all of this helps and if you want anything clarified or to ask other thing feel free too. Lots of love 🖤💖🖤"	iooylu	trans	11	0.93	2020-09-08 06:58:17
A few questions for the trans community!	"Disclaimer: I am not personally a member of the trans community. If any questions/topics are a means of concern/offense, please correct me. Any mistake comes from a place of ignorance not intolerance ❤

Recently, at my work, a trans man has been hired. He has a button on his shirt that says his pronouns (he/him). I have noticed twice that a few customers have labeled him as ""she"" in pure spite of the button, despite the fact that if he where to not have the button you could not really tell that he is trans-gender. 

This made me mad, more than him surprisingly. However, I dont speak anything political with coworkers at my job for safety. I was curious to know if it would be encouraged for other coworkers (despite sex) have buttons stating their pronouns. Would this be rude in the eyes of my coworker? I imagine it would make members of the trans community feel safter/less alienated. I could be wrong!

If this sounds like a good idea, where can I find ""reliable trans sources"" that could help me make an argument for this to be a part of my companies uniform? My company is pretty progressive, and I beleive that if I made a strong enough argument I could have substantial impact. 

Thanks for any help! Happy Thanksgiving"	"Everyone having their pronouns displayed is a wonderful idea. The more you normalize showing your pronouns, the harder it is for transphobes to discern if someone is trans or not and intentionally harass them.

For reliable trans sources, well you’re in a whole community of them right now!

Good luck on this! Worst case if it doesn’t become a corporate policy everyone could most likely just do it anyways since your coworker clearly is allowed to :)
You definitely seem to have the right idea, I know I'd be 100% on board with that at my workplace, or anywhere really.
Good idea. Yes, it normalizes stating preferred pronouns without singling out someone specific. The more people who engage in this, the more welcoming it is for trans people to do.
I think it would be a great idea. If your workplace already has nametags, then a pronoun tag isn't even unreasonable. As long as there is a 'prefer not to say' option. that should always be an option."	k0ywtz	trans	8	0.79	2020-11-25 19:24:11
Kim Petras winning the Grammy is amazing!	A lot of older people watch the Grammys like my grandfather. He know I’m trans and asked me if I watched it and I didn’t, but I heard Kim mentioned she was trans, which is great. Seeing a trans person succeed at the top level help normalize us even more. I think a lot of people are becoming accepting and it’s really great to see. The narrative is changing. Kim Petra’s has a big stage and safety to come out to the world, not all of us do. Some of us keep our identities more secret to most of society and blend in and it is nice to have a good representation of us. I’m so happy she won.		10wgonj	trans	9	1.0	2023-02-07 23:27:48
I am so tired	"I’m so goddamn tired of being a political battleground. While we are being pushed to the breaking point and slaughtered by hateful people, politicians debate whether or not we deserve to exist. I’m so goddamn tired of having to fight for every single freedom we deserve.

I never wanted to be an activist. I just wanted to be happy and safe without having to beg for my happiness and safety. I want to live in my own little bubble and go on cute dates with pretty women while being the woman I really am. 

I never wanted to be a fighter. But one time, I didn’t know how to defend myself and it almost got me killed. Now I spend every other day learning how to hurt people and it scares the hell out of me. I just don’t want to become another martyr. It breaks my heart when I see their faces and think of their families and I know I can’t do that to mine.

I’m just so tired. But we can’t afford to stop. We are in a fight for our lives and freedom and we cannot afford to stop. So I guess I’ll be an activist. I don’t really have any choice but if it’s what I have to do to not feel useless, I guess I’ll do what I must."		112l4kw	trans	9	1.0	2023-02-15 00:44:43
How do I feel worthy of being called a girl?	"I’m 17, mtf, pre everything because of family. I’ve finally managed to accept myself, and come out to my online friends (working on my irl best friend). But I just don’t feel worthy of being called a girl. 

I look like a dude, sound like a dude, dress like a dude. I know it’s for my own safety, at least until I’m on my own, but I still feel like I’m just a guy who wants to play dress up, or that I’m just an attention whore who’s only saying I’m trans to get noticed. How do I get past these thoughts?"	"I read a book called ""Yes, You're Trans Enough"" by Mia Violet.

It cleared up a lot of this inner chatter for me.
I feel that, so, so much. It’ll pass once the transition is made. I’m sorry I can’t help any more than that; I’m sure there are other things you can do but I got the switch way early so I don’t really know how to deal with it. Hope someone else in the comments has your answers.
This is something that i really struggle with as well, and it's really mainly about self perception. As you start to really believe that you are a girl it will feel more and more normal. Unfortunately there will probably be a while that it doesn't feel right and you don't feel worthy of being called a girl, but just know that it won't be forever."	pqwb4e	trans	8	0.91	2021-09-18 22:50:33

Transition Envy	"Hey fellow beings,

Anyone else have really bad transition envy? I hate it. It makes me feel like a shit person when I get envious of other people. I hate it a lot. I wish I didn't feel that. 

I was listening to the Gender Rebels podcast the other day and they were talking about it, too, and how you cannot compare yourself to anyone else's timeline because each person has their own unique one and comparison really is just...terrible for mental health. And it is. I've experienced that, comparing and hating and tearing myself down over it... 

The only one, they said, you should be comparing yourself to is you. Compare yourself to how you were 6 months ago, a year ago, hell, a day ago. That is the true comparison that should be being made. 

And I get that, but at the same time, it's human nature to compare. And it sucks. It's not like I want to compare myself to others. Especially when that someone is your friend. It makes me feel like a complete asshole. It makes me hate myself, in a way. I know it's a natural human emotion but jealousy and envy make me feel disgusting and dirty and gross all around. 

But when people boast about their transition and how far along they are and how great they look post surgery and hormones etc it just...makes me feel like I'm absolutely stuck. I'm still over here waiting on fucking blood work (third damned round) to come back a-ok before I am even allowed to try hormones. It's ridiculous. Well, it's not. Logically I know that this is for the best in regard to my safety and health, and that this is part of my process, but it still sucks seeing people so far along in their transition...especially when they're younger than you. Like. Fuck. Why can't I have realized this all sooner and done this sooner? It's frustrating. And unfortunately, part of the process. 

I guess this is sort of just a vent/time-passer while I'm waiting on these damned blood results. Anyways. What's your experience with transition envy? Do you have any? Any good ways to help you deal with it? 

&#x200B;

Thanks"	"I had some at the start but the path I took was to try and not compare and focus on what I could get done while I waited.  Not saying to ignore that envy.  Gods knows when you do start hormones, ignoring feelings is a fight uphill, but try to think of your other transition goals during this time.  The beauty of this process is that it is multifaceted.  Some get the name and legal stuff handled before going on HRT, others focus on their appearance, and others get right to the HRT,  and surgery research and goals.  

We each approach this differently.  And once you start? You'll still feel it.  Body changes happen at different rates, some people have a natural physicality that makes them present (I hate that term) their gender in a way you feel you never will.  Its gonna be something you face all along you transition but there is something that will help.

Share your progress.  Celebrate your wins with us.  Let us sympathize and emphasize with your losses.   Know you have a bunch of people here who have felt the same emotions you are along the way.  And when you get on HRT and those mood swings and food cravings hit? You're gonna have a lot of people who wanna share in those stories too. 

We support each other by being the support system we would want for ourselves.   By upvoting or simply saying, ""Damn you're looking good today!"" We are being the voices that push the dysphoria back a bit.

And know you're not alone in this feeling of envy, but know people are cheering you on at the same time.
Thank you for your support and share. I really appreciate the supportive words and spirit. It made me smile, at least. I hope that you're right about it all, too. I feel like I'm stuck in quicksand right now, not moving forward at all. I know logically that this is not true, but my impatience and desire to start HRT and dysphoria is really kicking my fucking ass as I wait...and wait...and wait... It's hard to hear others go through such happiness when you're not. Granted, I am trying to be supportive as possible to others in their transition too because you're right, we are a community to support one another! No doubt about it. I just wish I was...further along too. But I will keep going.

Thank you again."	c0pd4x	trans	9	0.86	2019-06-14 21:12:23
Why do they hate us so much?	"I’m genuinely wondering. We haven’t done shit to them. Our transitions don’t take their tax dollars, space, privacy, or safety. 

I find it kind of funny to go through some of the transphobic subs sometimes though because of how misinformed they are. I’ve seen the usual “you have a dick you’re not a woman”, but what really caught my eye as absolutely hilarious was when they compared transitioning to, and I quote, “magic”. It just showed me how misinformed they are. Science (which is the basis of ALL their arguments) has confirmed our existence. We are real. We have a whole assortment of reasons for transitioning, but we are real. 

What I’m trying to get at is that you are all valid, and those who would try to take us down are contradicting themselves all the damn time, and don’t have any evidence for what they’re claiming. You are all valid. Don’t let anyone tell you otherwise."	"People fear what they don't understand
People always hate something not themselves. It's pretty shitty but sadly human nature at its base instinct is to fear what is not understood.

Never understood and never will the hate for transwomen or transmen. People miss out too because everyone has something beautiful about them in some shape or form :)

Those people with hate in their hearts are missing out something fierce.
They want something to hate, they don't know how to deal with their lives or their emotions so they scapegoat all their toxicity on something they don't understand.
They see transpeople as deviant persons who in their mind should not exist. One of the main characteristic of conservatism (what anti-LGBTQ-people often are) is obeying rules. Especially when it comes to gender norms that are seen often (with nuclear family) as glue that holds society together. So, breaking of the those rules and norms are viewed as an attacked towards the whole conservative society. Transphobes often seem to think that the whole society will collapse if being trans is allowed in public. That's why they fear and hate us.
Idk I don’t get it either, people are treating us the same as lesbians and gays were treated like 20 or 30 years ago
They hate us because we represent what many of them feel and want. I don’t mean they want to transition or are necessarily secretly trans but it shows how fluid gender can be . It reminds them of their feminine/ masculine traits...most hate(not all) is directed at MTF as we have “betrayed the brotherhood”  by going over to the other side.  Our existence somehow threatens them...they react in the way they do because they are insecure in who they are and many know they could be LGBT. For others they see it as a weakness to be exploited without realising how stupid that really is. 

Be a man
Your gay...thats gay ...its gay
Boys will be boys
Only sissies cry
Fem men are less than real men

The ridiculous tropes in various forms go on and on and we have all heard them.  This is our society and its need to have everyone conform.

Lastly...many of them are deep inside their own closets and have been taught to hate themselves, turning that hate outwards is far easier than taking care of how they really feel until one day their lives are nearly over and all they feel is hate and anger for a world  in which they were not strong enough to be who they really were.
I never understood this mindset.  Why can't they let people live their own lives?  The worst part is when they don't understand something, they suddenly become experts in that thing.
I do not hate trans people and am sorry that so many do.  I do not understand it though, and while I have done reading about it I do not feel like I understand how to communicate about gender with my children.  I just wanted to speak up for the confused portion of society - some of the concepts are more challenging than others, and its new to many people.  I just want to say for people like myself - I have a lot of empathy for you and am sorry trans people so often are hated, and feel hated.
Oh damn thats sad
Humans will always hate outsiders, group mentality rules.
Sadly this is the truth.

Nervous about going on dates	"Recently I have been interested in starting to date and have had many men ask me out on dates ( flattering and tempting ) 


I’m always honest and let potential dates know I’m Trans, not something everyone should feel obligated to do but something I do. 


With that being said… I’m terrified to take that next step and go out on dates… I’m always worried about being harmed or ticked into going out, maybe I’m listening to too many true crime podcast but I’m super nervous and wanted to know what you all do when accepting dates ect for safety."	"Same thing I do for camping trips: Send someone a trip plan. Tell them where your going, when you're going there and approximately how long you'll be. If it's gonna be way longer just send them an update. Maybe also send them the person's name and photo.
First of all, congrats on transitioning!!! 

General advice: always have a fully charged phone, make sure you have a friend who has your location on find my friends or whichever service is best for your phone, and have regular check ins! Many of my cis girl friends do the same, so it shouldn’t be too hard to find a friend willing to do this. Don’t go anywhere alone with them until at least the second date, maybe have first dates be during the day if possible, always have the first couple dates be in public, and make sure you’re picking queer friendly restaurants/bars—a lot of bartenders etc will help out if you indicate you’re uncomfortable. 

Also, I’m sure you do this already, but i would advise against disclosing you’re trans in person. It’s totally your call to tell your dates that you’re trans, but try to do it over text before meeting, since that’s less dangerous! 

(I’m FTM, but this is the routine most if not all of my cis and trans girl friends follow!!!)
Can always start with a double date?
Honesty is good. I'm proud of you for that.

Use common sense:  
\> If it seems too good to be true, it is not true.  
\> If your gut doesn't like it, pay attention.  
\> Stay aware of your surroundings and of what's going on around you.  
\> Don't allow yourself to be put in a compromising or dangerous situation. It's ok to walk away.  
\> Have a plan.  
\> Let someone know where you are.

In spite of all this, let yourself trust. And don't give up.
Thank you for your time, super helpful!
Thank you, very helpful! Everyone is making me feel a lot better ❤️
No worries
Of course, I hope you have some wonderful dates!!!"	vdjqd1	trans	7	0.83	2022-06-16 11:23:40
A story of two trans strangers working together (#illgowithyou)	"So I’m FTM.  Been on T for 8 years, haven’t been misgendered since 3 months in (I recognize this is a privilege and I’m very thankful for it) 

My wife and I were celebrating our 12 yr anniversary and went to a town by the 1000 islands in NY to celebrate.  We went bar hopping and saw a lot of the same people were doing the same, so we ended up seeing many of the same groups through out the night. 

Later into the night I went to the mens room and it was one of those where there was no stall.  Just 2 urinals and a toilet out in the open.  No lock on the door either. It had a few guys in there already so I left and decided to hold it. I tried again later that night and as I was about to go in I saw a girl leave the mens room.  I once again couldn’t find the courage to go since other people were in there.  

I talked to my wife about it, and I asked if it would be weird for me to go up to the girl and have kinda like a “buddy system” thing (like the I’ll go with you campaign) and they said it couldn’t hurt and we could just leave if it went badly. 

So I walked over to her and explained that I was trans (she thought I was mtf and just starting out which is always flattering) and asked if she’d come with me.  It was a little awkward because I don’t think either of us expected to be in this situation but we were both determined to make it work.  She was so nice, waited outside to make sure no one came in, then asked if I was with anyone to make sure I was safe.  

My wife and I left shortly after. I just wanted to share this experience because it warms my heart knowing so many of us have each other’s backs! 

There wasn’t much conversation out side of safety and names, so I’m assuming her pronouns and how she identifies."		xhxr6a	trans	11	0.87	2022-09-19 01:12:17
depressed vent because hope is hard to come by	"Massive tw: su*cide, extreme sh, general self-doubt and lots of self-hate.


It’s hard. This whole thing is hard. Its been years and i still don’t know if I’m faking it. My parents don’t believe me, i picked a name i’ve grown to hate, and nothing has really changed. When I picture myself hanging from the ceiling fan, on the note I don’t imagine “I’ll never be a girl” written on it, I imagine “I will never love myself.” 

I cant stop thinking about it either. My thoughts keep going back to cutting it off with a serrated knife, or cutting into my skin again. I’m tired of this. I’m so tired. I’ve been clean for so long but it’s getting worse again. The only reason i haven’t gone already is because i don’t want someone to be sad. I’m afraid if they leave, I won’t have any safety left. 

If i was just born a girl this would’ve been easier. Maybe I would’ve ended up with just depression and anxiety. I can deal with those most of the time. Maybe I would be able to stand my own voice. Maybe I would be able to finally sing. 

It all feels really pointless. I was born wrong, and there’s almost nothing i can do now. I’ll be seventeen in a year and after that there won’t be any time left to experience life as a teenage girl. To experience anything but being a weird, depressed, pessimistic, self-hating, teenage boy. 

The worst part is, i don’t think i will make it long enough to be happy. I know there will be some extreme depressive episode that will take everything i have left. Some panic attack that will make me leave without a warning. Or maybe it’ll just be me. Maybe I’m doomed to hate me. 
But I don’t want to die yet."	"First thing I want to say is that your a very brave person for writing this message I don’t think many people could. Also when it comes to missing out on teenage years I wouldn’t worry about it to much I’m 22 and still act like I’m 18 😅 please know that this feeling is not permanent and thing WILL get better I promise you that ❤️ if you need to talk some more my dms are open and I’ll gladly help anyone that needs it ☺️
That's the exact state I was in two years ago... I know all too well how it feels. Hell, I still experience it almost every single day. I promise you, not getting to start hrt until your 18 isn't the end of the world. Will I ever get to experience what life is like as a teenage girl? Not at all. Does it still occasionally haunt me? Sure. But I don't let that stop me. You'll still be gorgeous if you start a lil later like I did. I'm nowhere near my goals nor in a good home life. But ik better days are ahead. Im sure beyond the shadow of a doubt that your friends care about you deeply and same you them. Let them be there for you. That's what they're there for. It helps more than you know. But if anything else... You. Will. Get. Through. This. Feel free to message me if you would like. Much love <3 and you got this sis
Everyone is unique. Being trans is a part of you, and you should be proud of it. If you hate your voice, I really recommend you to listen to Awfultune, she’s an amazing trans singer. Does she sound like a stereotypical cis woman? Nope. But, does she have a beautiful voice? Hell yeah!! Your voice is YOURS, and it makes you unique.

Scared for the future of The US	With Roe v Wade being overturned and all the anti lgbtq laws being passed im scared for my safety and rights especially if the republican party wins the next presidential election. I live in a consistently blue state with a good governor but it’s still scary.	"Try to move away if possible, I'm serious.
mainstream media and basically any news outlet will try and scare their audience or exaggerate things. don’t get me wrong, things could be better but this isn’t the end of days as some people make it out to be. I’ve been thinking about this older game named We Become What We Behold, a game where you influence what happens in a little sandbox area by taking pictures and putting those on the news. specifically the lines, “be scared. be angry.”

even as things start to turn bad, there’s still plenty of outrage and plenty of ways that these things can change.
You have nothing to worry about. Republicans have no desire to get rid of us. The United States is by far the most free and accepting country that exists, despite its many flaws.

Finally Accepted Myself (but am terrified at the same time)	"To start off I am ATM, a 23 y/o male (psychically) and finally realized I'm in the wrong body. After finally being off my nuclear cocktail of anti-anxiety meds (a story for another time), I've been able to think clearer. And thanks to the quarantine in my area giving me more time to think: a lot of stuff has come to light.

For years I have struggled with self-esteem, self-hate and loathing, lack of motivation, and general disgust for myself. When I was with my friends I would always joke that ""I don't want to live past 30"" because the world is crap (bad financial place, work prospects, PTSD), and I always looked past the reason for those thoughts.

My doubts about who I am started after my crap phase of life that was high school. I always loved the cutesy tomboy kinda girly outfits. And I always played as the female characters in video games, especially with create a character. Deep down I think I always knew I wanted to be a girl, but my mind at the time was so clusterf@cked that I couldn't think properly.

I than noticed I began to loathe my little sister (F18). Which shocked me because she is my best friend, and I love her with all my heart. She's a tomboy with a very cute girly side when she feels like it. I think I wanted to be like her so bad, but I was projecting like my dumb ass lizard brain does at times. What really sold me were the extremely vivid dreams of me living as a girl and being happy.

I've talked to my therapist and psychiatrist who have both said to keep quiet to my folks for now (who are wonderful parents and are not LGBT+ phobic) I've even given myself a new name as my old name never felt right. To think it took me 15 years to figure that out.

I'm just scared of this discovery. 2 of the things I am are considered grave sins in my religion. My town is also a conservative stronghold. I'm scared for my employment, my safety (all types), and too some extent my life. My confirmation sponsor is a die hard conservative and is basically my second mom. I just don't want to disappoint anyone. I've already lost a good number of friends due to being called a crazy Tr@nny it hurts.

I hope talking to some people who are also trans (on HRT, not, or transitioned) can make a trans-lesbian like me feel so not alone. (apologies for the long post)"	"i lost my friends and family, but i found a wife and happiness.  it hurt a lot but i am so, so glad i was brave enough to do it.  good luck, niijiikwe 💜✌️

A Clocked Work Transwoman	"In the midst of my pre 29th birthday mania, I found myself headed towards CVS on behalf of my boyfriend who was having major low back pain. I was getting out of my soccer mom car when I saw a group of preteen to teenage boys heading into the CVS. I was completely unaware of what would happen next. 

As I walked towards the back end of the store I notice that same group of boys. It was then when I realized they were unaccompanied by an adult. This began to worry me. Because unaccompanied boys are ""traviesos"" or in english, trouble makers.  I also noticed at that point that all of their attention was on me. They spotted me but what would happen next? 

As transwomen we must always be hyper aware of our  surroundings. Or at least to a point. I need to personally work on chilling out from time to time. But safety is really so important. I can always tell when people are clocking me because I'm always aware of my surroundings. Sometimes I wish I wasn't so aware so that what I didn't know wouldn't hurt me. For some reason I was not too worried about this group of boys because they seemed young enough to not act so foolishly if they were to see someone they believe is trans. Too bad this was not the case. One of the boys was daring enough to blurt something out. 

As I was searching for what my boyfriend needed. The boys found their way to my vicinity. It was then when a couple of them decided to run through the aisle. One of them innocently joking about the pull-up diapers he was holding. But the rest of them not laughing. I overheard them carrying on their escapades in an aisle behind me. This is when the clock struck trans doom. One of them was about to say something that would sting so much and lead me on a spiral of depression. 

From my somewhat foggy short term memory of just yesterday I can remember one of them saying something just remotely offensive before the next boy followed suit with a very loud and clear clock. It also was the most gross and crude clock I have ever heard said about me. Okay here's it goes. This is what he said: ""is it just me or did she have a boner"" I instantly started to shake. Not only was he clocking me but pervertedly lying all for a laugh from his friends. Suprisingly I heard no laughter. I wanted so bad to say something back like a teacher or a neighbor would. But I stayed quiet and I am glad I did. 

Thanks to a post on reddit. I realized that staying oblivious and quiet is the best thing you can do. It makes them doubt themselves.

The boys passed by my aisle shortly after, heads down in what seemed like shame. One picked his head up and looked me straight in the eyes as if to say sorry. 

I think about this cisgender men who are man enough to admit their attraction towards transwomen. I am thankful for my boyfriend and think back to all the times he has shared his stories of having a thing for transwomen at such a very young age. I realize guys and even adult men still act the way they would have on the playground. And still what happened yesterday made me feel ugly, hurt and depressed. 

I used my 10 extra bucks at checkout to buy snacks that I hoped would bandaid my pain. Of course it won't. It will just make my digestion problems even worse. Anyway that was my experience and I'm calling it ""A Clocked Worked Transwomen"".


Ruby Flores"	"At the very least they knew they messed up... that was out of line, I would have looked them all to make it loud, clear, and embarrassingly known to them that is unacceptable especially in a public place!

Is it possible to come out in uni without it reaching your parents?	"Couldn't find anything on the Goog. On all of my applications, I used my AGAB and my legal name (my preferred name is just a spelling variation; I can fix this easily with my parents knowing, no problem). I did this for safety reasons. A lot of the unis I applied to leave options for specifying your correct identity (in my case nonbinary or genderfluid) and a preferreed nickname. I filled neither when they were available, because I am terrified of my parents knowing. In the end they didn't check any of my applications like I thought they would so I'm beginning to wonder about whether I can come out in uni.

This seems stupid to me, because in what way would it reach them? I just don't want them to have access to any university documents that list things as my gender but I want to come out there. Or, for example, if I'm going to be mentioned somewhere in the future, like idk an article for whatever reason, I would technically be forced to misgender myself out of fear. Is it a good idea to inform uni adminstration if they're lgbt-friendly? Do you think I can safely go in stealth or come out to friends that I make without it reaching the wrong people?

Extra information to those who want to say ""cut them off"": they're overprotective, so I have no choice but to stay with them for the first few years (Bachelor's) as I learn how to manage things myself.

Final note: I have no intention of being openly trans AT ALL. I am a loner and the country I'm going to is overall lgbt-phobic but support groups exist inside universities, which shocked me."	"You could try contacting the student government there, or seeing if the school has an LGBTQ+ coalition or something, they could definitely help you navigate this!

You can also just go change it all when you get there. Think of people who become themselves part way through Uni and don’t know at the beginning—they get all this changed while they’re there. 

Hope this helps! Good luck and enjoy Uni!
Yes!!!! I actually did that last year haha. I came out to my team and school and it didn’t get to my parents. Even with them coming to my tournaments for wrestling. Though I live 12 hours from my parents.
Find out what information is included on your tuition bills. That's what's going to get sent to your parents.
Thank you!

You're right, I could easily just change my name when I get there, but I'll try the LGBT groups if I end up going into the university with one. I'm planning on dressing how I want to, so I think I'll stick with being out to that group only.
That's amazing! I'll have to check if my university is supportive first; if not, I'm sticking to people closest to me and trusted professors and faculty. It sounds wonderful!
Thank you! That's really smart.
It will be great!"	v46nfz	trans	6	0.81	2022-06-03 19:13:36
Coming out	I really want to come out to my family as trans but they really hate the lgbtq+ community and I have talked to my friends and they said safety comes first and I totally agree but I really do want to come out. Mind you I'm a minor and I don't have a car and I don't have a job either what do you guys suggest I do	"Get to a safe space first.

Work on getting to independence before you open up and come out.
I have to agree with your friends. As someone who knows a kid in a similar situation I know it kills you inside, and it kills me inside seeing them have to suffer. But safety is first.
Totally, the first step has to be independence, that is what I did.
Just to add to this.  I didn't grow up in a safe place to be out.  One parent is great, the stepfather was not.  The town was small and anti anyone being different."	swqzx5	trans	7	0.82	2022-02-20 02:55:26
Need some info as a parent please	Hello everyone! My child asked me to buy them a gc2b binder, they are 13 y/o. Are there any safety concerns I should be aware of? I did some reading and it seems like if they fit right and you don't wear them sleeping, it should be ok but I thought maybe people with experience might be able to tell me more. Thanks	"Don't wear it for more than 8 hrs, and make sure to hand wash it rather than machine wash it.
don't swim in it, don't exercise it, don't sleep in it, and try not to wear it for more than 8 hours.

always wash by hand, and never put it in the dryer or on a radiator.

as they're only 13, they're still growing, so make sure to measure every so often to check it's still the right size. if they think it's too tight, try sizing up.

also, i would recommend looking into other brands. never tried gc2b myself but i've heard their quality has really deteriorated recently. i have a binder from spectrum outfitters (uk based) and it's really good. they're usually out of stock, but if you sign up for emails then it will notify you when they restock. i've also heard that underworks are good.
Don't wear it for an extended time (about 8hrs as someone already said) and make sure it fits right. Otherwise there shouldn't be any safety concerns
Id suggest a binder that isnt from gc2b, as theyve had quite a large drop in quality. Spectrum, Underworks, and Wolfpack are some good brands to look at. My first binder was a gc2b one, and it didn't bind very well and hurt a fair ammount despite being the right size.

As for safety concerns, don't wear the binder for more than 8 hrs and dont swim, excersize, or sleep in it.
Depending where ur located there are other brands such as spectrum binders that are better then gc2b. I live in the uk and got mine from UNICMI
It is also not recommended to exercise in them as it might cause extra stress onto the ribs. But yeah that's all. Also, Thanks for supporting your kid, having supportive parents helps a lot.
Gc2b runs small
I believe you can also check with the National Center for Transgender Equality for binders and they make have them for you, or The Human Rights Council might also have them. Worth looking at each website to see what you might be able to get for your child, plus they will have support for the both of you.
Hey! So there is actually a peer reviewed paper in a medical journal about this
I suggest getting a sports bra or a binder one size larger for exercise or longer days.

It's also a good habit to take it off an hour before bed. And take 3 deep breaths to help your lung capacity.
Thank you for the replies!
This especially. I started binding at 14 and for some reason thought I wouldn't grow anymore so was confused when my binder started feeling too tight. I've sized up 2 more times since then so that point of listening to your body and sizing up (even if you think you don't need to) is important. I was nervous sizing up would mean my new bigger binder wouldn't bind as well, but it actually binded way better than my smaller one
Thank you for the info!
We are in the US. I will look into that brand. Thank you
Tl;dr probably about 15 years ago a set of “binding rules” started getting circulated around the community. They’ve never been studied for if they actually do anything. The only association this paper found with negative effects was number of days/week somebody binds. Spending more than 8h/day in a binder was not statistically significantly correlated with any negative side effects. My advice? If it hurts stop. Take days off when you can. But understand while binders have risks (most often skin infections), they also have massive benefits in terms of mental health, and the two have to be weighed.

His parents suck!	"My daughter is a fem, her gf is now a he. I’ve known for months! I told him that I’m 100% supportive. He wanted to join the Navy, and he was almost set to go. Huge sign on bonuses, the works! His recruiter is gay, and they spoke at length about his decision, and she was blunt. Trans have an 80% chance of being harassed and beaten up. They have a 31% chance of being gang ^aped. 

I’m infuriated, and I decided to lobby for trans safety. I’m glad the recruiter was straight w/ him, but there needs to be change. I msgd his mom, and asked if she’d like to help me write letters, get petitions signed, etc…she’s actually pissed off that he’s no longer joining! Wait what? What kind of parent would put their child in danger to beaten up or r*ped??? 

His mom quipped that  there was a 20% chance that nothing would happen to him. I want to take him in and give him a huge hug. I don’t understand his mom. I think she’s a pos, and it’s amazing he turned out the way he did. I love him for the person he is, I don’t care if he wants to change his outward appearance. I love him, for him!
He got accepted to a vet tech school, and it preps you w/ all the credits needed, if someone then wants to pursue to be a veterinarian. I’m so proud of him! He’s always wanted to be a vet, however, I just found out the reason his mom wanted him to join the military. Bc she thinks he’s too dumb to be a vet. I’m about ready to gather the town’s  ppl, give them a pitchfork and a torch, and march up to her front door. He said he feels like he now has a mom w/ me. He’s never been told he’s smart! Who does this to their child? It’s cruel, and I believe it’s abusive. I’m so heartbroken that she is angry he didn’t choose the military. That he was selfish by not joining. Idek if this makes any sense, bc I just  had to put it out to the universe. She’s horrible, right?"	"She's absolutely horrible. You make a way better mom. Thus, I will caller you Better Mom. You sound like you deserve it.

Good of the recruiter to be honest. Probably saved a lot of time and a lot of tears because of them. 80% is a number that I would prefer to be aware of before I decide to put myself in such charming company.

Holy crap! That's so cool that he got accepted to the school. I bet he'll make an awesome vet. From what I know, it's a tough job, but it also maximizes your chances to come into contact with kitties! Yay! I think it's the right choice.
Yes, I'm ftm and my mom is the same. She has narcissistic pd, likely comorbid with bpd. She always said I was smart, even a genius (idk about that), but she would swing back to calling my sisters and I ""fxcking stupid, rxtraded, @ssholes, queer (in a slur/mocking way), mentally ill (in a nasty way), crazy,"" etc.

She would hit us and scream at us. My sisters have fetal alcohol syndrome. It missed me bc I was the first and therefore she was careful I guess. There's a photo of me as a baby with a black eye trying to crawl up a wall to escape a room. There's a story my arm had to be pushed back into me as a kid cuz I hurt myself and totally didn't get my arm yanked. 

My mom declared none of her kids would be gay and jeered nastily that I'd failed at all my relationships. She hated me the very most. She goes on to say it is I who hates her. I don't. She hated my father who is no longer alive and she claims I'm just like him, which is ironic considering my gender identity. Her hate for him is intense, I mean, she didn't even marry him or have me on purpose and she broke up with him. You would think 25 years later she'd of learned to love her one gift from him and let go, it's like it happened yesterday and he's dead.

But she doesn't view all us accidental kids as gifts. She's said she wished she had ""Chinese slave children"" instead. She's racist and thinks this is funny. Meanwhile I love Japan and took Japanese in high school over here. She's also said we ruined her life and she wishes she never had children. She should've used condoms then. :)

People like her are abundant, they just usually fly under the radar because they know their abusive, sadistic ways are reprehensible. They would get mad others see it that way too, or else dramatically contort their face and play victim for having been exposed, such misunderstood creatures they are! They have faults for everyone and are high level manipulators. 

Sociopaths are not necessarily all these goofy serial killer caricatures we see in movies. More often than not, they're just moral devoid, miserable people. I've even read on Quora that they _can_ utilize empathy, they just switch it on and off. They all operate the same. Exaggeration and slander are favorite techniques of theirs, as is twisting reality and projection. NPD is absolutely worth studying.

I wish to someday see a world where this is common knowledge. I'm so happy this young man is going to save animal lives for a living, what a beautiful thing. It's too bad about his mom. But look at what a blessing of a mother he now has. Thank you for looking out for him.
Thank you for looking after your daughter and her boyfriend. They are lucky to have you! 

A minor piece of feedback on your language, mostly because I’m not sure it’s on your radar. Your first sentence “…her gf is now a he.” In future, I’d recommend putting that as “her boyfriend recently came out as a trans man.” That has the same effect but doesn’t misgender him.

I came out to my parents, it went well. I need some help with what to do next.	"I came out to my parents over the phone. not ideal but i am out of state and i needed to get it off my chest. My parents said they were surprised and that they needed time to process and understand. They also said they want to talk about it in person. My mom seemed to take it better than my dad. My mom was mostly worried for my safety and worried about school.

My dad didn't say much but i could tell it wasn't news he was expecting to hear. My sister is home with them and she said my dad wanted some time alone after the phone call. 

I also told them i would send them resources to help understand what i am going through. I have sent them the gender dysphoria bible and [i also sent this article](https://medium.com/gender-from-the-trenches/gender-dysphoria-isnt-what-you-think-6fdc7ae3ac85). if you have any resources that would help them understand that would be great.


I am worried that between now and when i get home they will read false information about hrt or something and will say its too dangerous or something. or that they will want me to go to a therapist for a while before starting hrt. I am going to start after i finish freezing my sperm with planned parenthood, which should be february at the latest. 

any advice would be helpful."		z4v6xd	trans	8	0.9	2022-11-26 02:09:48
Coming out social media post.	"I wrote this for International Transgender Day of Visibility. Im not officially out yet. This will out me. I need your advice, guidance and thoughts. It's long and can be triggering but I would be forever grateful if you gave it a read and shared your thoughts. Thank you.

Coffee Thought of the Day: International Day of Transgender Visibility.

Today my feed is filled with the brave entertainers, individuals and allies who have made the leap, found happiness and never looked back. Today is the International Day of Transgender Visibility. A day to debunk and confront societal prejudice and discrimination by showing how many there actually are, living life free, normal and liberated. I wouldn't feel right if I didn't write something today, not for me but for someone without the defensive and coping tool set I have honed in my 40 years of living in this world. You see I have known my entire life that I don't fit into what society says Im suppose to be. Im not the masculine, emotionless, tough guy, or “real man” that's expected of me. No, I'm much more rounded than that.

The past:Day care – I've known of an inconsistency since the age of 3-4. I remember being in a onesie pajama suit and seeing a commercial for a polly pocket toy or something and asking it for Christmas. Only to be corrected, “that's a girl's toy”. Or wondering why I don't get to wear colorful dresses like my friends. You see, this isn't a sexual thing or a fetish. It's an identity thing that's wired in from day one. I didnt have sexual thoughts until many years later. I could barely wipe my own butt. This was a part of my makeup. I remember being in daycare, playing house and wanting to be the mom. I had a mom, I didnt have a dad. She was a strong roll in my life. She was the only role in my life. Dad's kinda came and went. Yea they taught me things and treated me well. But my mom was the role I knew and I was proud of that role. I knew as I played house that the role I was playing was not what friends and adults expected of me, at 4 years old. This was told to me on a daily basis by them. And to be fair, I understand why. This was the early 80s. Much different than the safe space kids get today. Gender incongruity was gay and being gay was wrong, immoral and illegal in most places according to straight people, even though it had nothing to do with being gay.

Elementary – Throughout my early school years I oppressed half of my psyche as a defensive mechanism. When you're reminded of this through teasing, bullying and policing on a daily basis you do what's safe and you fall in line. This created two persona's driving one body. The masculine, Christopher which stayed in the forefront and the feminine, Christina which was oppressed to the shackled dungeon of my soul. Much like having two identical twins in one body but opposite genders. Every now and then I'd drop my guard, she'd emerge and I'd get teased for it. I was called a f\*g more times than I could count. It was an every day word I became numb to. Back in your shackles Christina, the mob has spoken. You have to understand, there was no non-binary or gender spectrum. There was man and woman and the only time you saw someone deviate from this they were lined up on Maury or Jerry like a side show act and the host would say, “Which one's got the wiener? Find out next”, while the crowd yells phobic obscenities. Kids today don't know how good they have it.

Puberty – Throughout my childhood I did boy things. I played street hockey, guns, had a bmx, and developed a sharp wit whenever I had to defend Christina. For all intents and purposes, I was a boy. But I knew every moment of every day, she was with me. Shaping my compassion, my empathy and my creativity. I remember being about 9 years old, the world was just starting to talk about gender diversity and telling my best friend at the time, “I think I might be somewhere in the middle with this”. He responded, “So you'd let a man stick his d\*ck in your a$$?”. I didn't know what to say. I liked girls so this was confusing to me. I immediately retracted and talked about hockey or something. As I entered puberty I was playing with small engines, video games and riding my bike. All the while saying, maybe one day when it's safe I'll let her out. And then girls found me. At the time I was often reminded I looked uncannily like Jonathon Brandis, a teen heart throb plastered on the front page of every teen magazine out there. This got me attention with girls. They mainly came to me, and I was ok reciprocating. From the age of 13 on I never had problems spending time with girls. Guys never talked to me like girls did. No one ever bought me flowers. So I spent my time chasing girls. And it was fun until the first big love of my life broke up with me after 2 years because her older sister convinced her I “wasn't man enough and she should get a 'real man'”. She's on my friends list and if she's reading this, I never forgot this moment. It's shaped the core values I seek in my partners. I remember in grade 9 the cool kids in my class voted I would be most likely come out as gay. This really confused me as I was literally dating 3 different girls from 3 different schools and living a real life episode of three's company. That was before I learned dating morality. Im sorry if you were one of them. I was a selfish teen at the time.

Survival – For most questioning their gender, puberty is a tough time of exploration and dysphoria. For me puberty was about survival. I was teased and bullied heavily at school and my folks and I were very much not getting along at this time. It was around grade 9 I decided to stick up for myself physically. I became the hyper-masculine loose canon everyone wanted of me and at that moment I was no longer bullied. It's still with me today, regrettably, whenever I feel threatened. I remember spending so much of my time focusing on my walk, my mannerisms and my posture. I needed to look the role. From the age of 14-16 I was either running away or getting kicked out. At the age of 16 I left for good, got a job and never looked back. But I never had the privilege to do something as frivolous as explore my gender. And no one around me would accept it anyways. This was the late 90s. I knew this would have been social suicide so I didnt do it. Back to your shackles, Christina. It's been this way for most of my life. Trying to make it as a public figure in a public world without committing social suicide. I'd bottle up, hide half of my psyche and hope everything would work itself out. The problem is, it didnt. I was reminding every day that half of my being was not allowed to exist. I have memories throughout my life. One that sticks out at the moment was in my early 20s in a nightclub. A girl was giving me attention. Her friends came to her and said, “no, lets find you a real man”. Admittedly I did not compare to the meat that walked in that place. I was 5'9”, 150lbs and had around 5 chest hairs, all individually named. I never had the dose of testosterone my counterparts took for granted. I think this is why I was saved from full on dysphoria for most of my adult life. I didnt get masculine features so it was easy to oppress. Until my 30s when I started to develop an upper body, hair in places I didnt want it and fat in all the wrong spots. It was the second puberty I didnt want. That's when I started to feel body dysphoria although I didnt have a name for it then. It created a looming sense of depression and identity crisis I couldn't solve. It only got worse.

The Present: Covid - When covid hit I saw an opportunity. I could grow out my hair and let the other half of my psyche breath. I didnt have to answer to corporate gigs and social expectations. I could be free. The problem was I liked it. As my hair grew I started to hear a voice yell from inside of me, “THAT'S ME! THERE I AM”. I knew this was problematic as I would have to be publicly honest and deal with social pressure, stigma and discrimination. This, not being allowed to be honest and free at the risk of what others think brought dysphoria to the forefront. I started to hate everything about my image because that's how others expect me to be. That's how my friends, my Aunts, my estranged father I haven't spoken to in a decade, my work, my peers and my colleagues all expect of me. To break from the norm is to bring on accusations of mental health, weakness and inability. This, in turn, created a deep dive into anxiety and depression. I had mental health issues because I feared those close to me would feel I have mental health issues. The world is not a safe place with this stuff. I know because friends, family, peers all openly tell me. Im told Im a fad, not valid and not accepted. I'm weak, a fetish, a freak of nature. And as I spiraled farther and farther down the endless pit of dysphoria and the prospect of social alienation I started going to dark places. Places Ive been to in the past that speak of self-harm and suicide. Not again. February 2021 I made a pact with myself. I would no longer shackle and oppress the feminine side of me but rather lift her up and protect her. Christopher would stand at guard in support of Christina instead of oppress and shackle her down. This moment created a wave of euphoric liberation that words can't describe. In the LGBTQ world they call this cracking the egg. It was as if for 40 years half of me had her head held under water and was suddenly released to breathe for the first time. The depression, the thoughts leading to potential suicide, the dark places, all of it was replaced by freedom and liberation. I haven't been the same since. From that point on I've been posting not so subtle hints on social media. Pictures of long hair and painted nails but also pictures of Christopher holding the fort. Those who hold prejudice and stigmas have come out of the woodwork just like before. And while I deflected with comedy and wit, this would fuel anxiety and depression. The genie was out of her bottle and she refused to go back. Im not sure I could live with myself if I continued to oppress half of me to make others comfortable. As time went on I started to see other entertainers I've known for years in the same boat being authentic and I thought, if they can do it, why can't I? They were an inspiration to me. Maybe this is possible. A month ago I went to see a psychiatrist about this under the guise of ADHD. Dont get me wrong, I very much have ADHD but I wasnt ready to talk about a gender crisis publicly.  Not when those close to me are making fun of or denying non-binary and transgenders so openly. But you know what? It's not me they're attacking. It's their own insecurities projected onto me. Here's the reality. This has been me my entire life. If I've told you it's because I trust you. I've never kept this a secret. I just didn't advertise it. If it came up respectfully among trusted friends I was happy to discuss it. But that wasn't the norm and it's still not today. I have to make a stand. Take me for who I am, truly and fully or go away. I don't want you around me if simply existing makes you uncomfortable. You clearly have demons you need to work out and that's not my cross to bare.

The future: As of writing this I'm currently one month in a 9 month waiting list for a gender therapist. They may tell me nothing. They may prescribe me hormone therapy. I might be the same Chris the next time you see me or I may have some bodily changes. I'll discuss that with the educated medical professional assigned to me. As of this moment I would very much classify myself as non-binary with dysphoria. This has always been me even though I didnt outwardly show it. I didnt have the words or safety to express it. I am not a fad. I am not weak. If you think this about me no matter my appearance just remember, I can rebuild an engine, repair a PCB, wrist the top shelf, shoot the gap on a tight track, grease a bike, fix your car, shoot and clean a gun, been trained by a former South Korean royal guard to crush a larynx, get put on a police registry because of that training, be a loving father and a steadfast husband. And if you think this makes me gay just remember as a touring entertainer who uses charm and wit to command crowds in the hundreds and thousands, I have likely slept with more woman than you. I can out man you. This doesn't make me gay. Gender and sexuality are not the same. Im bi-curious at best. I'm ok with being gay even though I've never been gay. I dealt with my prejudices long ago. I suggest you do the same. I don't equate my partner to what's between their legs. If my girl friend told me they wanted a sex change I wouldn't dump her. I don't parade her around saying, “this is my pussy”. Who you are as a person is what attracts me. Not your junk. In today's terminology I would be classified as demisexual. This is not a coming out story. I was never in. This is for those who can't protect themselves. That's why I write this.  This is for them."		tsplfk	trans	6	0.76	2022-03-31 02:26:13
How to help someone outside my immidiate area?	"Hey friends, I am an extremely minor internet personality. I point this out only to emphasize how far removed I am from the situation.

One of my fans is a trans person living in flyover country. They posted on twitter that they were assaulted today (they called it getting ""beat up"") and that this sort of thing is a regular occourance. I am incensed. I want to help if I can, but I'm not sure where to start.

I only know this person because they won a raffle from my show. We aren't the sort of friends that I would feel comfortable poking into their business. I also know my feeling that authorities would provide safety is probably more than a little built on privilege. Still, I know this isn't right. This person is 24 (not that it is ever okay at any age to be attacked) they must be dealing with adult assailants. This can't be safe and I am worried.

Are there any resources I can point them to? Or way I should go about checking on them? Or am I grossly overstepping my bounds as random person on the internet? I feel like I am out of my depth."	"Jeez.

It's great that you want to help this person! But I'm not sure how you could do so without potentially making everything worse for them.

I'd say that you should start with a private message that apologizes for the world being so shitty to them and says that you are angry about it happening.

You could then ask them if they have any desires or ideas about how you might help. I wouldn't try to do anything without at least their permission. If they refuse help it might not just be because of pride or humility. Lots of things can easily end up in shame, anxiety, violence, and discomfort, and they know this all too well.

Above all, respect their wishes.
If they are assaulted, then the attackers need to be reported to the police. Assault is a crime, and I think you would be pleasantly surprised to find that the police are accommodating in instances where a crime has occurred regardless of who is attacked. 

Contact the police. 
Yeah I was pretty sure I didn't have much place trying to get this person help but I didn't want that to be an excuse for inaction.
Well wishes and just telling them you're on their side will do a lot more good than you could imagine.

And if they want your help, then totally do it! I'm just worried that you'll make things worse for them unintentionally. 

Also, as a more general form of help: You could start lobbying your congressperson or find other political ways of being an ally and trying to prevent this type of abuse and hate from continuing.
On the show, we have a segment every week where we ask our audience to call their reps about different issues. Trans rights are frequently highlighted. I'll throw together some non-invasive ideas. Thanks for your insight!
That sounds great! Anything political helps, because trans people are usually disenfranchised, and even then they aren't, it's extremely scary and dangerous to be public and political as a trans person.

You're doing good work."	78wkgl	trans	8	1.0	2017-10-26 16:07:38
Chest binder recommendations?	"My binder is kinda falling apart, as it was a lightly used gift from a friend anyway, but I’m looking for a new one. I know about gc2b and I’m heavily considering one, but my current one is an underworks binder, which I do really like. I was wondering if anyone had certain recommendations or links? 
I’d like another one from underworks but I can’t figure out how the site works. 
And my mom is actually helping me shop for one (yay for support!) and wants to get one off amazon, which I don’t fully trust for safety reasons, but if anyone knows any good ones from there that’d be cool!
Any suggestions or help is appreciated!"	"underworks binders didnt last me as long as gc2b. i love gc2b
im really liking underworks rn because its higher strength and i dont really find it as uncomfy as other people say they are
i personally found gc2b binders much more comfortable and breathable than underworks , but their sizing is kind of weird (theres a huge difference between small and medium and i happened to need one right in between the two lol), and the fit isn't as aesthetically satisfying/dysphoria reducing in my experience ! also i found that the elastic started to degrade weirdly in gc2b ones so theyre basically unwearable . however , i had to quit binding awhile back due to chronic pain being exacerbated , so these things might have changed . in any case i hope you find one that suits your needs and is comfy ♡
You can get underworks binders off amazon, if that helps! That's how I got mine. Other than gc2b and underworks I've heard good things about flavnt (which has binders that are also made to be good to swim in) and shapeshifters tho they're both more expensive so might be less of an option
Thanks! I will definitely keep those two in mind, and knowing that I can get underworks off Amazon is very helpful"	ilc0ab	trans	8	0.85	2020-09-02 18:07:06
Requesting advice	"Hey all! I'm in a bit of an identity crisis and rather than drowning it in iced coffee I'm coming to someone to ask for help. 'Someone' happens to be the relative safety of The Internet! Because anonymity.  
I'm 26, a male assigned at birth and for the most part I'm comfortable to identify as male. The most part. Much to the detriment of my peace of mind I find myself wondering how life would be if I were either a girl in my entirety or even in part. It's hard to describe accurately; the feeling changes daily and can range from a little to a lot in both intensity of feeling and the degree to which I'm uncomfortable in my own skin.  
So what I'm asking is basically...what's up with me? Does anyone else have some answers I'm not able to stumble upon on my own? All my YouTube searches and chats with close friends hasn't yielded anything definitive - aside from the fact that I'm loved no matter what I choose. As much as that eases my heart, my mind remains restless.  
Thanks in advance for any help offered, and I'll likely thank everyone who comments profusely as well <3  
Until then, be brave and be safe."	"I guess it’s time to experiment. I can’t tell you who you are. All I can tell you is that exploring your identity is a fun, exciting thing. Have fun with it. Don’t stress yourself out over not knowing. Live and learn and explore.
hmm well there are tons of options, really. the first few that come to mind are genderfluid and girlflux. i’d suggest researching those terms to see if either fit you, but here are some brief definitions (from my head, so they might be weirdly worded lol): if you’re genderfluid then your gender changes, every day or every week or even every few minutes. the amount of time varies per person and so does the actually genders that you change between. for example, some people switch between male and female, some between male/female and agender, some between demiboy/demigirl and male/female, etc. and plenty of people switch between more than 2 genders, like female, male, and agender. it may be hard naming exactly what genders you identify as at any given time, so you could just say you’re genderfluid and not have to elaborate. 

the other one is girlflux, which is the female version of genderflux, which basically means that you feel female (or whatever gender) but the “amount of female” changes. for example you could feel 100% like a woman one day, and the next only feel like 20% woman, and maybe the rest is agender or male, or whatever you feel like. most of the time people who are genderflux only fluctuate between being agender or non-binary and whatever binary gender they identify with, but of course you don’t have to completely fit that label, and you could do some more research to find one that fits better
I think it might help you to look up gender dysphoria and see if that matches what you feel. I’d also encourage you to try something small and feminine - painting your nails, maybe - and see if it feels good. Read through places like this and hear our stories, see if any of them resonate with you. 

I can’t tell you who you are, only you can decide that. But there’s this idea a lot of people get that trans folks are absolutely miserable all the time about their assigned gender and/or their bodies before transition and I do want you to know that that varies widely. For me it was just a sort of vague discomfort. So yeah, seek out trans voices, which you’re doing, experiment, and keep thinking about what life would make you the happiest is all I can tell you
I can relate to this and for me I thinking I was gender fluid was a good start to understanding who I am, so go to Google and spend some time experimenting with different labels and gender expression. If you can afford it do some shopping online for things like nail polish and makeups like lipstick and eyeliner. Looking at trying cloths like a skirt or dress can be very for filling. Depending on how doing these types of things makes you feel can say alot. 

Just remember there are no requirements for you to feel any which way when experimenting but how you feel can help guide you to who you are.

Best of luck on your journey
Stressing is all I'm good at though TT3TT  
All I have to do is learn how to turn a profit from my anxiety and I'll be too rich to care about anything from my super yacht XD XD XD
First of all I love your name dude X3  
Secondly, flux is definitely a good way of describing it. Everyone's been giving me some good stuff to go on. The more I learn the less I feel I know! Aaaaa
It's definitely solid advice! Thanks friend\~
Thanks\~! I'm hoping I can find my answers swiftly
ty! and that’s a good sign imo, obviously being confused isn’t fun but the more options you have the more sure you can be that you choose the right label, if you ever do choose one. and if you don’t go with one, you’ll be extra sure that’s what’s best because there are so many things you could have gone with, if that makes sense. i know it can be scary but there are tons of people on here to help you and you can take as much time as you need <3
Don't try to rush it, for some people it can take years. You don't choose how fast you find your gender, your gender choose how long it takes.

Does this belong here?	" If this isn't the right place for this, feel free to delete it. I'm new to Reddit, and I don't want to do something wrong.

I'm here because I'm trans. And I've literally never spoken or written that down before today, even though I think it multiple times a day. I'm 35 years old, and this is the first time. 

I'm scared. I'm afraid of losing my family, my job, my safety -- I'm even afraid of losing my body. I hate it, but it's what I know. It's *all* I know.

As far back as I can remember, I always wanted to be a boy. I have 2 sisters, and when we played pretend I always wanted to be the prince, or Tom Sawyer, or whoever the male character was in the world we were pretending to live in that day. I vividly remember getting in trouble when I was 6 because I took my shirt off like the boy next door had just done.

Puberty came late for me. I was 14 before I got to the point where I had to wear a bra. I hated it. Hated my hips, my breasts, my period -- at first, all I wanted was to go back to the way I was before. Then the dreams started -- and this is embarrassing af, but if I can't share it with total strangers I'll never meet, who *can* I share it with, right? Isn't that the whole purpose of the internet lol? 

Anyway. The dreams. They were sex dreams, but 'wrong.' I was the one on top. I could *feel* down there, and in my dreams I was hard. I can't explain it any better than that, and I'm turning bright red as I type this, but I was most definitely male. And they're recurring. I still get them sometimes. Idk if anyone else has had a similar experience, but I'd love to know if anyone has.

It's not just the dreams. It's everything. I want to be myself. I want to be the person I'm supposed to be -- and I'm terrified. I can't even tell my family I like other women. Telling them I'm trans would almost certainly mean instant expulsion from their midst, with a boot in the ass on the way out. I don't want to lose them, but at the same time, this is killing me. I wake up every morning and do my make up the way I was taught, but I can't meet my eyes in the mirror. I present as very feminine -- my hair is down past my waist (and objectively it's beautiful, but all I want is to cut it off and give it away), and as I said, I always do my make up and dress nicely. I was raised to behave like a lady, but it makes me feel sick inside until I get busy enough to forget what I'm wearing.

Idk if anyone else felt/feels this way. I don't want to say 'I hope so,' because this sucks. On the other hand, I don't want to be the only one. I want my experiences to be the door that opens onto who I'm supposed to be, instead of just a constant feeling of wearing the wrong skin. I can't put it any more clearly.

I'm sorry if I should have posted this elsewhere. I just couldn't find anywhere else it would fit. I just want someone to tell me that this is normal, that I'm not losing my mind. I can't tell anyone irl, so the internet is my next best choice lol. If this is in the wrong place, I apologize, and feel free to delete it. Thank you."	"Here for you! Pronouns? Also if you need to talk about anything message me!
He/him. I've always used she/her -- but I'd like to give the other a try. Even typing it out makes my hands shake, but in a good way, if that makes any sense? I'm still fumbling my way through this, but the way I felt just now when you asked is something of an answer in itself. Thanks so much for reaching out.

Thoughts on breast implants?	I feel like I'd look better/feel more confident w them but the safety concerns scare me. Anyone here have either good or bad experiences with them? Breast implant illness seems to not have a ton of research, and none w trans people, so I don't really know what to think. Would love any thoughts or advice on the matter. Thanks!	"I had breast implants, stayed 1 day in the hospital, a little discomfort for 2 weeks, mainly if I  raised my arm over my head. After 1 month, recovery complete
Look into fat transfer.
Have you been on HRT for a few years and are you unhappy with that growth? I’m very satisfied with my natural breasts. Implants never quite look or feel the same as natural breasts so if you haven’t had the time to grow them yet so suggest you wait until you know for sure.
1.5 years or so on hrt, and I'm roughly a 36 b. They look nice, it's just that they're not noticable at all w clothes, even w pushup bras. I think about implants all the time, because I feel like I'd be more confident if they were bigger, but safety is important. Fat transfer is possible but it's hard to estimate what they'd look like after that procedure as compared to implants
I see. I have an AA cup and mine are really obvious but I’m pretty big. I like small breasts though so I guess I won’t mind them shrinking as I lose the excess weight. As for you, if you choose to get implants, I really suggest you look into a c cup. It looks the most natural and it’s what they offer for free here in Sweden. Whatever you choose to do, I hope you end up feeling more comfortable in your own skin 💖"	kyzj1s	trans	9	1.0	2021-01-17 04:39:23
I'm horrified and need advice/encouragement	"TW/CW: transphobia and venting

This is the first time I ever make a reddit post and I will probably delete it later because I'm scared of being outed but I apologize in advance if I used the wrong flair or if I made a bunch of grammar mistakes.

So basically I'm ftm, I have known I wasn't cis since I was a child because I always experienced social dysphoria and when I got older I figured I was most definitely not a girl. Even though I knew I was in denial for a really long time and tried to force myself into being cis because I knew if I came out there was a chance that my parents didn't support me.

In 2018 I came out to my mom as pan/demisexual and she was accepting and understood, which led me to thinking I could discuss the fact that I'm trans with her and last year I tried to come out to her. I use he/they pronouns so I was explaining to her my pronouns and gender identity in general but she started telling me she wouldn't call me a ""thing"" and started telling me I was a girl and would always be and a bunch of transphobic things. After that I was incredibly upset, told her to just call me whatever she wants because I was frustrated and upset and went back into the closet, went by she/her pronouns and my dead name. This once again made me incredibly dysphoric and upset. I still tried to explain to my mother and educate her but no matter how much I tried she kept saying things like ""trans people can pretend they are something that they are not but they will always be what they were born as"" or ""trans women aren't women because they don't have a uterus."" (I apologize in advance to any trans women reading this because trans women are women and I ended up telling her that it's incredibly misogynistic that she thinks like that because she herself had to get her uterus removed because of health issues.)

I forgot to mention I also had a therapist who was ""supportive"" and ended up outing me to my transphobic parents and I had to convince them I was cis once again for my own safety because she didn't discuss telling my parents, she only discussed telling my parents about me wanting to change my name. Either way I talked to my parents about them using a more androgynous name to refer to me for now because I told them I simply disliked my dead name and they never listened, they keep dead naming me even though I try to remind them and I think I will have to live the rest of my life hiding because why the hell can't I just be a cis girl. I just feel like there is no hope for me and I just have to live the rest of my life in the closet because I don't want to lose my only friend for coming out or disappoint my parents even more than what I already have.

TL;DR: I have transphobic parents and I feel scared and hopeless because I think I will have to live the rest of my life as a girl when I'm not and I'm scared to come out to my only friend.  

Edit: I forgot to add TL;DR"	"One day you'll be an adult and move out and even if you love your parents you'll talk to them at best 20x per year. And if they hate you you never have to contact them again. 
  
Despite what movies tell you, being young sucks. You'll be fine eventually and you're far from the only one here with transphobic parents.
I'm sorry you have to live through that. I hope your friend will be more accepting if you ever do come out. All the love to you and feel free to poke me if you ever need to vent. I'm sure there's more people willing to listen here as well <3
If you know you are FTM, you should not have to live as a cis female. That choice is solely yours and if you want to live as a guy then you should live as a guy. If the people around you are shunning you or turning their back on you because you are male, then turn your back on them. They do not deserve you. You deserve better. There will be other people out there that you can make friends with that will be supportive of what you're doing.
You are right, thank you!
Thanks, I hope so too (he seems to be pretty supporting but due to past experiences I'm still a little scared) If you ever need someone to talk to I'm here too :)
Thank you, you are right it wouldn't really be worth it living as someone who I'm not
Scared is understandable. I recently came out as genderfluid to my best friend. I was really nervous, but he took it really well. Asked me what it is and just took it as that's how it is. Was really cool. I know that's not always the case but  it does happen 🥰 Just remember it's ok to take your time as well. I'm currently not able to really live out as much as I want, but I use online as a forum to really live out my girly side and it helps alot.  Maybe you can find some kind of outlet too? It doesn't solve everything but at least for me it makes me feel better and happier 🙂
Congrats on coming out to your friend, I'm glad it went well :)

yeah that's a good idea, thank you!
Thank you. It was alot easier then comming out to my mother :D Everyone have taken it well though, but then again I mostly present agab with them, and they all live about 13 hours drive away so they don't really have to deal with seeing me otherwise ;)

Considering moving to IN, advise?	"tl;dr: anything we need to know about being trans/lesbian in Indiana before moving there? 

My wife (mtf, 31) and I (cisf, 29) have lived in AZ most of our lives, and have been in CA for the last 6 months. We are currently thinking about moving to Indiana, specifically near Angola or Fort Wayne. My best friend and her family live there, so we will have a small community of accepting people to support us. We also don't have a community where we are currently and already have to travel to see family, so that's not a consideration. 

We're worried about the cultural differences moving to a very red state, where there have been multiple anti-trans/gay laws passed, and some very vague hate crime laws. A few other pretty scary things popped up when reading about lgbt laws in that state. 

Is there anyone currently or previously living in Indiana that has any advice for us, or things to know? Specifically interested in:

1. Daily discrimination issues
2. Health coverage and access
3. Physical safety concerns
4. Employment discrimination (I know there are laws in place, but realistically, is this an issue?) 
5. Housing, etc. discrimination 

Any information or first hand experience would be helpful!"	"I’m on the Kentucky side of the Indiana border, I’m not really sure how it is in Indiana, but I feel like I’m the only trans person in a 500 mile radius lol. Sorry I’m no help
Indiana is definitely not the best place for trans care (ftm in south bend here, born and raised in california). Discrimation laws are almost non existent and depend on the town you're in. I don't know about fort Wayne personally and you should definitely research that. Catholic hospitals are the norm and I've been refused treatment at them multiple times. As far as employment goes, that really depends on where you work, how well you pass, and if there are any indicators of deadname or gender on your documents. Denial of healthcare, eviction, and firing are legal if your county doesn't have protections.

That being said, the people in general are extremely friendly and are the type where if they see you in a ditch in a snowstorm they'll stop and help.
I currently live in Indiana. I'm only out to my friends currently, and while there are accepting people to be found, I wouldn't necessarily say they're what you should expect especially in rural areas. 

***Also! Regarding healthcare:*** 

Franciscan Physician Network owns a loooooot of medical offices and hospitals and such, and their policy is to not provide gender-affirming or reproductive care. Pretty fucked up, but they don't advertise their bigotry too openly; you can set a preferred name and gender in their patient portal app and while the staff may respect that, the physician will not prescribe any reproductive or gender-affirming care, upon pain of getting fired. 

So if you do move to Indiana, make sure that you are going to have access to appropriate medical care beforehand-like, call up the office or provider and get an answer from them about their position on providing that care, because otherwise you might not find out until you've made an appointment and brought it up in person, and at that point you're stuck paying a copay to have been told to get fucked. 

...please excuse my language, I'm still bitter. 

If you move to a more urban area of Indiana, (Indianapolis) it's possible you won't have to deal with that kind of thing. I can't offer any information in that regard unfortunately, having lived only in the northern part toward lake Michigan, myself. Either way, I hope everything goes well for you, and that you have better experiences than I've had. :)
I live in Indiana, originally from Oklahoma. I'm FTM, so this is also from that view.

Avoid Angola with a 10ft pole. They're very backwards there. As for fort Wayne, it's not too bad. Depending if you're passing or not. A lot of your treatment, especially as mtf, is going to be dependent on this. As for lesbians, 100% good for ft Wayne. 

That said, I go to Indianapolis for my healthcare. Fort Wayne doesn't really have much for trans healthcare. Goshen has one clinic, but Eskenazi also has a vast net with a specialized transgender health clinic. I love it there. It's worth the drive.

I'm brown. Disabled. That's where most people discriminate against me. Not against my trans status. But, trans men have it much easier in Indiana whereas trans women have faced violence. Our state statistics aren't promising.

As noted above, I have amazing healthcare with eskenazi's clinic. I'm very pleased and my coverage has been great. I'm on UHC and Medicaid. 

Yes, employment discrimination happens. But, I've never not been hired. Just had to correct ignorant comments, even from bosses.

Housing I haven't updated my information yet, but I don't expect much issue. I'm visibly masculine and my landlords have not said anything. My neighbors let me be. 

Any questions you have I can give more info
Hi, Indy trans gal here! I’d avoid Angola personally, but places like South Bend, Lafayette, bloomington, Indianapolis (and Indy suburbs) and Fort Wayne should all be relatively fine places to live in regard to how the general public treats queer folk. Yes, it is a red state and there are some crazies out there, but largely I haven’t had much in the way of problems in regard to my transition. Only had a small handful of transphobic situations I’ve been in, even early transition, and none of those were violent. That said, I’ve only ever seen 3 trans people in Indy out in the wild. It was hard for me to seek gender affirming care at first, but resources like GenderNexus can get you pointed in the right direction there; I haven’t had any issues with medical providers since coming out, even though my ID doesn’t match how I look at all anymore. I can’t speak much on employment discrimination, but I can imagine that some business owners will defer from hiring you for being trans since this is a pretty red state in spots, but in my own experience, I’ve kept and held the same job since coming out and have had 0 issues from coworkers or superiors; I’m now just another girl in the office. The President of our company told me to personally go to him if anything were to ever occur so he can make sure it would be addressed. I haven’t faced any housing discrimination either, but that one’s a weird situation- I stayed closeted from our property company until I got my legal name change and it turns out the person who manages my lease had a second job at an Ulta I would regularly go to so she already knew. All in all though, it’s my understanding that housing and employment discrimination laws exist, but are minimal. Largely, it just depends. Most larger cities in indiana are fine, but I wouldn’t touch anything south of Bloomington with a 10 foot pole.
That's definitely good to know! I'm sorry, though. Sounds a bit lonely"	s52uae	trans	8	1.0	2022-01-16 03:55:53
Um hi please tell me it gets better	So I’m 13 and a trans girl and I just got a death threat, my exact address and the whole cablam, we’ve talked to the cops and taken every precaution to i sure my safety but I’m still really scared, my paranoia is at it’s highest it’s ever been, I’m laying next to my bat and a lot of knives, checking every door and window every 5 minutes, I’m really scared. Please tell me it gets better, I know trans people are targeted a lot but I’m just so scared, anyways hope this made sense I’m just really scared bye love you all 💜	I don't know where you live but it should get better.

Let’s dissect the term “cis bootlicker” and it’s sometimes Freudian undertones real quick.	"Disclaimer: this isn’t to say that some trans people don’t repress themselves or talk *loudly* against their own community just in an attempt to make themselves more palatable to a society that actively persecutes and oppresses us. Obviously, that’s not an uncommon thing in *any* minority group. Human nature is to assimilate when you’re the odd one out… it’s for survival first, then for comfort, a feeling that you belong, etc. and more often than not it stems from an insecurity that the people you are *attempting* to liken yourself to have caused for you, if it isn’t simply a must for safety reasons.

We have all done this at some point, be it on a lesser or greater scale. We’ve tried to explore people’s likes and interests so they can relate to us, we’ve changed the way we dress, we’ve hopped on social trends, we’ve learned to repress our thoughts and excitable energy in the company of people that might find us annoying. Some code switch, often because they have to, some mask, others pretend to like something they don’t in the company of someone they want approval from. *Of course there are trans people who do this to an extreme.*

… but am I entirely wrong for thinking it’s become a bit of a buzzword? I’ve seen all sorts of people be called this, even the most progressive of sorts. And I can’t help but feel like, at least sometimes… the phrase is problematic in of itself.

It gives very “I personally value the thoughts and words of cis people more than I do any trans person, so it’s easier for me to credit them for your own personal thoughts, opinions and words… because it is unfathomable to me that you could formulate nuanced individual thought all on your own.” as if cis people are inherently more capable or something.

If you stray from what people assume is the trans monolith in any way, your individuality must be entirely due to the influence of cis people. It shifts any potential value in a trans person’s words, expression, *everything* right over to the people that oppress them. It’s… dismissive (but I’m sure sometimes a fair albeit crudely worded critique) at best. Shows that you, on a base level, think that trans people cannot function on their own or *live* without it being *for* people you clearly regard more highly than you should, at it’s worst.

Here’s some extreme examples I’ve personally witnessed of why different trans people have been called cis bootlickers:

• Personally feeling uncomfortable with it when they’re asked their pronouns. (Everyone’s entitled to express their personal wants, even if it conflicts with yours.)

• Being stealth. (This person I’m thinking of specifically was literally outted in the process.)

• An ftm man mourning the fact he wasn’t eligible for the top surgery he wanted despite meeting some of the requirements.

• Somebody made a vent post because their dysphoria was especially bad at the time of posting, and couldn’t bring themselves to leave the house.

• Somebody *wanted* cis people to ask their pronouns.

• A nd person expressed confusion with xeno pronouns. Nothing mean spirited was said, they just expressed that they weren’t sure how capable they were of understanding a concept that was so foreign to them.

• Someone told me being “trans species” falls under the trans umbrella because the word “trans” doesn’t only belong to *transgender* people. I said uh, yeah, respectfully no. A separate person, a 13 year old, called me and anyone that agreed with me cis bootlickers. I wish I was joking.

• A trans woman expressed some discomfort/fear with her inability to pass while living in a bad area.

I could probably think of others, but I feel I’ve already made my point… outside of the scope of these people’s personal perceptions, it feels as if nothing any trans person feels thinks or says is of any value to them, not because we’re actually bootlickers, but because *they* personally *grossly over value* cis influence, while undervaluing how capable we are of living outside of it.

laser for mustache shadow? thin it out enough to shave away?	"Hello, i am amab, transfem but nb, and have a mustache shadow that i can. not. shave away. 

would like one round of laser, or one of those home-use lasers thin out my mustache hair enough for it to shave away without leaving a shadow? without getting rid of it totally and permanently? I’m still boymoding/am ok frida kahlo-ing it a little sometimes but I just want to be able to remove the shadow when i want to! 

any other advice totally welcome, i use an ice cube and DE safety razor already. i can get rid of it if i don’t shave for a while and do this method.

thanks!!"	"I'm brand new to this myself, but I've done a bit of research. From what I've found electrolysis will do the trick and shouldn't break the bank, assuming you're looking for permanent removal. I hope this helps. ☺️
The shadow is hair under the skin (as you know). If you laser it (or home ipl) the hair follicles are weakened (weaker hair = maybe less shadow, but probably not enough hair for a moustache) and hopefully die (No shadow = no hair) .
If the hairs are dark, which it sounds like to me you are, you can probably go laser. But if light haired, you'll probably need to go electro.
Yes, laser. (That’s it.)
I am a cis woman with facial hair (South Asian) and I use hair removal cream. If you shave it just gives you stubble etc and doesn’t look as nice imo
I used to get my face waxxed before Covid. And I'm hoping to again soon. After the few days of redness, my face was clear and smooth
I'm afab, but I know its super common for people to get their upper lip waxed. That would take away the shadow for a couple weeks at a time."	meh6jm	trans	9	0.85	2021-03-27 16:29:07
Concern for relative	"Hi all 

My cousin is 21(ish) and mtf. They haven't started hormones or anything like that and only just come out and is involved in university societies for lgbt and trans issues.

Theyve live a very sheltered life up until now, I follow their universities pages etc and the groups are involved with very extreme movements and other extreme political parties. They've always been sheltered in a quiet town now they're in a big city with all this stuff going on and I'm genuinely concerned for their safety at times when I see the things that they've been involved with.

Any ideas how I can appropriately convey safety advice without coming across wrong? I'm concerned they're getting involved with extreme political movements and or the darker side of the lgbt community which they are completely I'll prepared for (we are very close relatives I know the social history/dynamic not assumptions)

Any advice would be appreciated"	"Not update but have noticed I've used they pronouns throughout this post. They use she / her pronouns but its just the way I type. I completely support her and am not attempting to invalidate pronouns through this post.
Could I get more information about what these politics are? That seems extremely relevant and important.
Protests and counter protests to violent groups, chaining themselves to buildings and blocking roads etc. 

The groups they are involved with are linked to extinction rebellion and other groups. I'm not arguing the politics or anything like that I couldn't care. But the protests and demonstrations I've seen on Instagram stories often turn to violence, there was one in my city and 3 people got stabbed in a riot that got formed. I was going home from work at the time and had to break up an attack that happened on a trans person after a pride event (that one is unrelated)

I'm concerned that they don't know how to be safe. They seem to be involved with alot of Acab and other things and where antagonising police when they had counter protesters being violent for the trans march. Just simple common sense stuff.

I'm not a genius or anything but my upbringing is the opposite of there's I've lived a very rough life and theyve been so sheltered and now theyve been thrown into this world. I just wanna give them tips on how to stay safe but don't wanna come across as insulting
Personally I think it is both extremely brave, and immeasurably important that they've chosen to get involved in direct action.

It is just as admirable that your focus is protecting them. But don't let that desire to protect become a need to insulate. You definitely should not try to stop them from going to protests and counter protests, etc. but try to keep her save when she goes out. And I think that kind of support would be invaluable so someone trying to make a change. If you're able to attend any events with her then you should go, few better ways to keep someone save than by being with them.

Most orgs that do direct action also have ways of keeping protesters save, i.e. a buddy system, basic first aid, etc. So ask her what kind of safety measures are involved and taught. And if you think anything essential for safety is missing maybe you can bring it up at a meeting, or at least give her what advice you know on how to stay safe. You can also gift her some safety equipment, football pads, first aid kit, some milk just to make sure they're covered.
Were on compeltly different sides of the country so going isn't really a option I'm afraid. She has no family down there and it's purely just the new people she's meeting. Its part of growing up and getting independence but as we both know, activism and the lgbt communities have sensible sides and also some outright malicious and nefarious sides that often get hidden in the mainstream.

It's just from what I've seen me being frightened for their wellbeing. They're gunna do what they're gunna do but I just want them to be safe. The world can be a nasty place sometimes and I dont wanna see them get hurt. They sent me photos at the last protest where they where being very disrespectful towards the police and it turned into a them vs police protest. When there was a anti trans islamism protest happening on the other sign if the police line fully prepared to fight them. I had to ring them and very sternly tell them to get home now and had to guide them through the city on maps to get them out. 

They need the world exposure but she needs it safely and I think there teetering on the edge of radical with these groups and one step and she's in a situation she can't get out of.

(I know several people caught up in cults through these groups and others who have ended up addicted to chem sex from similar situations and they are an vulnerable person hence my concern)"	r5bmsa	trans	8	0.9	2021-11-30 01:52:02
Rec for city to live in USA?	"Hi all y’all :) I’m looking to move out of my small rural area into a bigger city and open to literally anywhere in the United States, looking for recommendations.

Relative safety and resources for trans/lgbtq people, cost of living, general vibes, music/food scene, job availability, and community are some considerations for me! 

Also love me some outdoors but Ik that’s a lot to think about :)"	"DENVER COLORADOOOO trans laws are pretty good and trans care has to be covered by private insurance next year!
The Atlanta area has a thriving LGBTQA+ scene, and most people I’ve encountered here are pretty chill. 

The rest of Georgia is kind of a right-wing dumpster fire, but here in the ATL (I live in Decatur actually) it’s good and queer.
I think generally the bigger coastal cities have bigger queer scenes, but they’re all pretty expensive places to live in the city, and community and acceptance rates go down as soon as you get into the suburbs most places, but New York, Los Angeles, Miami, SF, Boston are all good places to be for trans people. Another consideration is state laws, like some places have better requirements for what transition surgeries are covered by insurance.
(Western) Washington has nice Trans laws for insurance and beautiful forests. Most areas are safe, crime-wise, beside Seattle and the weather is just lovely. Rent in some cities are rough, but not God awful too.
Anywhere out of the US. If you can, go to Canada. Live your best life. You won't regret it.
I’ve always wanted to move to Colorado if I can’t move to Iceland or Canada
Okayy honestly that would be amazing but like how tf does it work 😭
Out of the big liberal states, I feel like this one is the most affordable but still on the expensive side for sure. I heard Canada is great too! Don’t know much about Iceland. Wishing you the best 🤗
Thank you! Iceland is one of the safest, if not the safest country for trans people and probably the LGBTQ community. I don’t know much else though, and I may have to learn a new language. So not my first option as of now
Wow I didn’t know that! Seems like a really wonderful place! I can imagine it being super expensive tho. But I don’t know much about it."	xs8jn9	trans	8	0.9	2022-09-30 18:23:31
Why I unsubscribed from TYT	"If you are not aware, Ana Kasparian, one of the main anchors of The Young Turks online news network, has recently been making statements very similar to a pre openly terf JK Rowling. When hosts of other online left wing shows pointed out the problems with her statements, her response was to double down - this time with the support of owner of the company, Cenk Uyghur. The failure to even consider the viewpoints of people who are on the same side - and in many cases had actually cohosted the main TYT show before - made me realize that I really didn’t want to give TYT my money anymore so I cancelled my membership last night and sent them this email as to why. (And yes I know this shows an inflated sense of self importance but isn’t that what Reddit is for?)

————

Earlier today, after 4.5 reasonably happy years as a subscriber of TYT, I cancelled both my website membership and my YouTube membership. Since my reason for doing so was the actions of two members of the leadership of the network (and two people that I actually greatly respect and used to admire quite a bit) I am writing you an email to explain why.  


Simply put, I canceled my membership because I refuse to ignore comments that I know are dangerous to my existence as a transgender man just to remain a fan of a television network. My friend (who is also trans) is a devoted fan of Harry Potter to the point that he writes HP fan fiction and I have spent years watching him contort himself into knots to justify why he continues to do this when he knows that the creator of the work doesn’t believe in his basic humanity. After a couple rounds of tweeting “what I think Ana means is this…” and then explaining why what she said is wrong in the hope that she will read and learn from it, I have realized that it is futile to do so when Cenk and Ana’s response to their peers doing the same was to attack them on Twitter and on the main TYT show. 


I am not sure exactly what led to Ana starting to believe transphobic talking points when as recently as a few months ago, she was criticizing people on the “right” for doing the same thing but I hope for the safety of trans people that it stops soon. As a transgender man who until a few years ago was a person with a uterus but not a woman, I intimately understand the importance of inclusive language especially in healthcare.  People die when healthcare workers don’t take into account the fact that someone who does not appear to be a  woman could be pregnant or suffering from undiagnosed reproductive system cancer and consequentially fail to check their patients’ reproductive systems. Before I had my ovaries, uterus, and cervix removed, I had to get a Pap smear while still having a deep voice and a full beard from my HRT. No amount of imagination would have described me as a “woman” but I was for sure a “person with a cervix” that needed that examination. 


I am concerned that Ana and Cenk will intentionally (or unintentionally) influence their followers to also believe that recognizing the healthcare needs of trans people somehow harms cis people thus leading to even more erosion of trans rights and the time has come for me to stop acting against my interests.  


This is not a decision that I take lightly as discovering TYT in 2018 basically saved my sanity by showing me that other people held similar political views to me. It showed me that the world was crazy, not me. But it also taught me that when an institution is doing something wrong, I should vote with my feet and leave it. And that is why I have cancelled my subscription. 


I sincerely hope you listen to your well meaning colleagues and realize that inclusive language isn’t meant to harm cis people. But until then, I will be watching from the sidelines.

My partner came out to me as a trans woman.	My partner came out to me as a trans woman. I love them and this doesn’t change how I feel. I’m wondering how I can navigate this new change and be the most supportive person I can be? We’re 22, I’m a female. What questions should I be asking? How can I support her? Do you have any nice ideas on how to celebrate this new awakening? I was thinking of buying her some clothes or makeup. But My main concern right now is her families criticism and her safety in public and how to come out to friends.	"I suggest standing up for her when the time is appropriate if anyone is being rude to her about being trans. 

I would definitely ask her if she would like any clothing that would make her feel more comfortable. there are lots of online shops that sell women’s clothing that are better suited for trans women to wear (certain kinds of underwear and bras and tucking gear)

The number one thing is to NOT go around telling people. That’s up to her
It's great that your first response is support! You may find sine helpful discussion over at r/mypartneristrans

Communication between the two of you will be very important: although your partner's transition will obviously be an huge deal for them, it will impact you and the two of you together as well. Being open, honest, and communicating with one another - especially if things are awkward, unknown, or uncomfortable - is critical. 

Having just gone through this with my wife last year (I'm transfeminine, she's cis), here are some things we're found very helpful: 
- talk right away about what you can do to have space for her to explore and express herself right now when it's just the two of you: name/pronoun use in private, dress, presentation, etc. Creating that space can be an huge relief and gift to your partner, and can be lots of fun for you both, but only to the extent you manage the communication. There may be things that catch you off guard and might make you uncomfortable, you may do or say something without any ill intent or seriousness that she takes badly.  You both have to talk about the possibility of that up front and know that trying things out may not always work as well as either of you hopes, and be ready to talk to each other openly and lovingly if you hit a speed bump 
- identify what resources you have available for community and individual support: knowing that now so you can turn to others for help/info/counselling is a wonderful psychological safety net, and makes it easier to look for help if things start getting rough, rather than after something is already bad
- in line with the above, talk together about identifying at least 1 or 2 mutual friends that she might be comfortable coming out top early so YOU have other people who know you both that you can potentially talk to 
- let her lead the way for timing, but ask that she keeps you in the loop before any major steps in terms of announcements to new groups of people about who she is, it'll be smoother and happier for you both if there's regular coordination around that so you're never on eggshells about who she's actually out to
- encourage her to lay a good foundation before going too fast or too far with coming out. Even with wonderful responses, it's an emotionally draining process that can build up and leave behind a lot of stress, and that needs time to work itself out if anybody. Also, taking small steps at least early on and coming out to ""segments"" of your social circle that are strongly expected to be supportive (it's never a 100% guarantee) are a grwat way to build confidence and comfort, and start creating spaces for her to explore how she wants to express herself socially

As for a gift - ask her! Anything you offer her now has extra meaning, as you may have the chance to give her her very first makeup lesson, or skirt, or perfume, or who knows what. Sharing something like that together can be a lovely way for the two of you to celebrate this big event. 

Wishing both of you lots of love and happiness together!"	eiqqpl	trans	7	0.9	2020-01-02 00:58:02
Very Worried About a Trans Friend of Mine, Need Advice with Boundaries and Safety	"This is going to be a bit long, but here it is:

A very close high school friend of mine is a trans woman who began transitioning about a year ago, she currently lives across the country from me (in the same city as one of our friends) and I'm very concerned about her mental health and safety. Like me, she is in her early twenties and graduated college last spring. As of right now she is unemployed, does not have stable housing (is staying with friends), and does not have a clear path out of this situation. According to my other friend, she has been getting by through the kindness of friends and by shacking up with strangers she's met via tinder and whatnot. Obviously, this is not a stable situation for her and my friend and I are incredibly concerned about this.

On top of this, my friend and I are very worried about her mental state. Last spring, she was committed to a psychiatric facility for what she described as a ""break from reality"", and my friend has stated that in person she appears to be manic, somewhat out of touch with reality, and generally not acting like herself. From my interactions with her online and over the phone, I tend to agree (based on admittedly limited information).

She has a college degree from a very prestigious school, has good work history, is very smart, and comes from an economically stable family. Transphobia aside (and that's a big aside), she is very well equipped to make a stable living for herself. My friend and I are both unemployed, so we can't give her financial support, and the responsibility to help her obviously lies with her family.

However, the problem is that (according to her) her family is totally unsupportive. Her mother is somewhat accepting, but has not accepted her trans identity; Her sister has totally rejected her trans identity; and her father has become substance-dependent and emotionally unstable because of his transphobic reaction to her coming out. As a result of her father's toxic reaction to her, her parents' marriage has been breaking down as well. 

But based on her shaky mental state, my friend and I are not entirely sure about the family story. She has had a tendency to lie in the past (including details about her family) as well, which adds to the problem. This also seems to be very out of character for her family, which by prior judgements was a stable, supportive, and progressive family (of course, abusive and intolerant family dynamics can hide beneath this veneer). This has made us question how much of the rift between her and her family has to do with their rejection of her, or her rejection of them.

We're really worried, and we want to talk to her family about the seriousness of her (tragically common) situation. And on the chance that the story about her family isn't entirely true, and they may not be as fucked as she's said, we want them to help her out (because she's their fucking child). 

I don't want to stir up the family situation any more, and put her or her family members at risk by contacting her parents about this directly (as they, mostly her father, seem to be the source of the problem). So, as imperfect as it may be, I want to talk to her sister about what the family situation is; and based on this information, make a judgement about whether or not to contact her parents). Obviously, I would want to have this conversation under complete confidentiality and I wouldn't reveal any details that might compromise my friends safety or mental well being (contact info, location, etc). 

Does anyone here have experience with situations like this? Would I be putting my friend at risk? Should I try something different?"	"I've had a very similar experience a couple times with non- trans people. This a tricky situation and quite often in real life there are no right answers. You very likely don't want to hear what I have to say from my experience, I'm sure. So I'm going to give more generic advice. 

Talk to your friend about getting a job. Don't lecture them if they don't ask for it, but maybe send a text every once in a while asking how they are, how's the movie she just watched, and how the job search is doing.

Secondly, don't do (or not do) anything that would make you uncomfortable. If it makes you uncomfortable, there's probably a reason for that. Stop and think about what makes you uncomfortable before doing anything uncomfortable.

Thirdly, be a friend for your friend. Text/ call/ message her often. Your support is invaluable.
Be the best friend you can be long distance. Chat with her about her day, ask her how things are going. If you can afford to I'm sure sending her some money would be a gigantic help. Even if all you can afford is $5 that could help her get a fancy coffee or a couple slices of pizza. Small gestures like that can mean your day or week when you don't have much.

"I live in an extremely transphobic (perhaps homophobic, they have no clue I'm bi) household, and a few months back I told them that me being trans was 'a phase' for my own safety. I did it online as well, and only told some of my closest friends that it was all a lie. I was being ignored at home and bullied at school. I felt like I was walking on eggshells wherever I went, my brain constantly dissociating to hide away from everything. Recently, I started going by he/him pronouns again at school which has been practically impossible to hide from home. Whenever I have friends over, they refer to me by my real name rather than my deadname and some even call me he/him pronouns around my mom. I can feel her eyes glaring at me every time they say something, as if there's a lazer going through my body. She even asked me about it, asking if I identify as transgender again. Even though I said no, she's been treating me like shit again. When she believed it was only a phase she treated me like her kid again. Now I'm helpless, scared, and vulnerable again, not to mention I'm out of a job. What if she does eventually kick me out? I would have nowhere to go. I have next to nothing in my savings and not to mention they have co access to them and can take advantage of that anytime. They have threatened to put me into foster care more than once this year, and I truly am scared of them.

This was more of a rant than anything, which I apologize for, but I really just needed to get that out there.

Wish me luck,

Jury duty	I have jury duty tomorrow and I’m worried about my appearance and safety due to living in Texas. I’m about to be 7 months on t and have a poofy pink Mohawk and don’t know how I’m going to minimize stares, should I dress according to my agab or just go for my comfortability? Is there any suggested ways to style my hair to make myself blend in more? It’s for a very typically conservative leaning county and I really do not want to stick out, any suggestions would be greatly appreciated	Damn, I hate this for you. It might be worth it to go with “gender neutral” clothing just to have a nice balance of ensuring your safety and being comfortable.	wehniu	trans	7	0.82	2022-08-02 17:26:53
[discussion] it's not about gender, it's about the socialized expectations. Potential triggers.	"So I know this is more of a ""duh"" title but hear me out.

I was reflecting on the hate we receive for us just being ourselves, socially and/or medically transitioning, when it dawned on me. It's not about *us*, it's about defending/maintaining the socialized (patriarchal) roles, expectations, and order. An indoctrination over years social pressures and micro aggressions to craft a resolve that is blind to other  socioeconomic statuses, patriarchally permitted normalized experiences, and most importantly the acceptable expectations of others. This is the default narrative many of us are socialized into and the intrinsic assumption/framing made in discussions (academic and cultural) that has pleaged trans and queer social narratives.

""Normal"" is an artificial ideal, yet around this patriarchal indoctrinated framework whole life's have been built and expressed. From an early age, our biases are hijacked and formed to defend against any cognitive dissonance that could challenge this default assumption. As trans and/or queers we expose this for the false framing that it is.

Our need/desire to have a body that matches how we innately understand ourselves rattles the self-imposed cage of systemic socialized conformity. After socially transitioning, many of us are ok with our new socioeconomic status in exchange for the safety that conformity provides. Yet we will forever carry the knowledge that this framing we and society is a house of cards that many blindly defend; even to their own detriment."	"[deleted]
I don't disagree with you or profess to know your experience. However, how much bottom dysphoria someone feels is kind of on a sliding scale. Some people have it really bad, others not so much. 

Although I didn't like mine, I was okay with it until I started to date while on HRT and then I realized this is not how I want to have intercourse ever again...my bottom dysphoria kicked into overdrive. Now, several years post-op, the idea of something swinging between my legs is unimaginable. 

Likewise, for trans men they might experience something similar to either of us about the desire for lower bits. Everyone is different and how they feel about themselves is only for them to determine.

Came out to my boss	"So yesterday I came out to my boss, after 2 years of HRT. I presented exclusively male at work all this time primarily for safety and to avoid gossip and drama. Its become nigh impossible now to hide some changes, particularly hair, which was putting me in the crosshair for being out of dress code. Since there are no rules to address or manage transgender employees, this may lead (hopefully) to significant rule changes in the company. My case has been referred to senior leadership for consideration into how to proceed with gender segregated dress codes. I hope this creates a positive environment where other employees can feel safe to live their true lives without retaliation or harassment.

After my meeting, I went home and discovered it was TDOV. This was unplanned on my part, but the coincidence was wildly appropriate."	"Wonderful! Congratulations. I'm coming up on 9 months in stealth. I just cut my hair back down because I was accumulating too many female gender markers to feel comfortable.

I'm hoping to keep stealth until next year, but I'll have to get creative with my clothes too hide things well enough."	1290ghd	trans	8	0.83	2023-04-01 22:04:53
Can I tell my (horrific) coming out story? TRIGGERS!	"TRIGGER WARNING, lots of violence and trans/homophobia

.

.

So this is something that's been a long time coming. My therapist (who is great in every other way and has saved my life, so don't say anything about her) is adamant that I'm not really trans, just confused and traumatized from sexual abuse (maybe true) so I don't talk to her about this. I'm scared of chasing my boyfriend away because he knows I'm trans but choses to ignore it (for which I'm pretty grateful) and my brother doesn't reaffirm me so I have almost no one to talk to about this. 

I tried to come out 14 years ago. FtM. I was a pretty little 14 year old, I'd just lost a lot of weight (through an eating disorder), developed boobs, had long flowing hair, etc. I looked like your typical ""any other girl"" but I wasn't as greasy and nasty because I hit puberty early and got it over with lol. I fell madly ""in love"" with my trans friend and realized that I didn't feel like a girl. Hearing how he (FtM, now back to F) talked about his attractions, his feelings, his body, it made sense to me. I never got along with girls because I never felt like one. I always felt out of place in friend gatherings (until high school when I made some really close friends) I related more closely to guys because I WAS ONE.

Because I was so pretty and traditionally feminine and quiet, no one expected me to be the one to save her allowance and buy a bunch of men's boxers or ask to have her hair flipped and buzzed. The hair thing wasn't allowed so I just kept it in a tight bun and away from my face so I wouldn't look like Rapunzel or something. When I was out with friends, I'd change into lose fitting jeans and hoodies. I LIVED in hoodies in the Louisiana heat lol. At home and school and church I'd wear skirts, skinny jeans, figure showing things that I'd normally wear. I was also very sexually active at 14. My therapist thinks its got something to do with sexual abuse and trying to cope and deal with my feelings.  

When my mom found out that I was wearing boxers to school under my skirt and an ace bandage + tight sports bras around my chest, she flipped out. Not for my safety, but because she and my dad are VERY Catholic. My dad was the leader of the Knights of Columbus (its a Catholic men's club that prays and does charity) and she was a member of some committee, so they couldn't afford to have their reputations tarnished, even though the church we attended was 2 towns over from where we lived and no one I knew went there. But no, their standing in the church was important. So my mom found my stash of men's/loose fitting women's clothing, my rainbow accessories, my boxers, sports bras and ace bandages, and made me burn them all. She made me burn things I had made. I use and to sew and I took a lot of creative liberties with some of my outfits and she made me burn them. 

I tried to come out to her but she (and I at the time) didn't know ""trans"" was a thing. I thought it was just a feeling that all lesbians felt, being 14 and undereducated about the LGBT community, so I said I was a lesbian and that I felt like I was in the wrong body. My parents sent me to church to be prayed over. They never told anyone why the priest was seeing me so often or why I wasn't allowed to go back to mass, just that I was ""sick"" and needed a priest. My mom also told me I needed ""some dick"" to get over it. She told a 14 year old to go have sex to cure her identity crisis, essentially. 

There was a lot of physical abuse over the course of a few months. She would strangle me until I passed out, she'd beat me with a broomstick, my dad would tell me he was disappointed (which hurt more than anything else) and they tried to turn my younger brother against me. He just told me he loved me and that I would always be his sister. He came out last year as gay and moved out shortly afterwards. I wasn't allowed to see my friends. Especially not my trans friend. He was banned from the house, even though he was also my brother's friend. My parents talked to the school counselor (small school, very conservative town) and they were told to keep an eye on me and make sure I stayed away from my friends. They went along with it because my parents told them that they were making me do bad things like cutting (untrue) and experimenting with drugs (also untrue). 

I guess that about sums it up... 14 years later, at 28, I still am in the closet. The only concession  I'm permitted is being called the male version of my name (similar to Charlotte = Charlie). I haven't moved out because my parents are getting older and need help and I'm too indoctrinated to care for my aging parents to leave them. My mom tried to apologize, saying my neurologist and pediatrician and a priest friend told her what to do when I was 14. I don't believe for one second that she is remotely sorry but I told her if I ever came out as ""anything"", it would be hundreds of miles away when she's on her death bed. If ya'll have any questions or want to talk or even just want to tell me that my story is fake because its Reddit, feel free."	"Charlie, I read this whole thing, and I am so sorry that happened to you. You didn't deserve any of that. *gives you hug* (if you like hugs)
I think the stories that hurt the most to hear are the ones where someone is betrayed by their parents. I never wanted to be a parent, and I figured that out from a pretty young age. People would talk about it like it was just this thing you do, like it wasn't even a choice, it just happened. I saw it as a tremendous responsibility that I may never be able to live up to. The skills and intelligence you need to even have a chance at doing a satisfactory job is staggering, and that's if you have a great government and community supporting you. Most don't have that. And then there's general culture and ""common knowledge"", which encourage you to fuck your kid up so often, it's like they have money riding on your failure.

Even considering all that, knowing how ridiculously unprepared most parents are and adjusting my expectations for that, I still keep hearing stories like this where they disappoint me utterly. The biggest point of solace I take away from so many of them is that these kids turn out to be pretty fantastic people even when so much was working against them. I try to stay positive, need to, really, and people like you help a lot with that. The world has become a much better place because of people that rise above the petty cycles that we so often lock ourselves into. This community has introduced me to so many people that do just that.

If it's any consolation, I think you're a wonderful son. If I had a son, I hope they'd be something like you.
I am so sorry this happened to you. Actually after reading this I realized/finally allowed myself to think about something which I have always suppressed
I love hugs.
If you'd like to talk about it I'm willing to listen

I might have to tell my some what transphobic mom I’m trans if I can’t think of a reasonable excuse for this	She has apparently been receiving the same college emails as me. All of which refer to me as a different name. She just texted my sister asking and she seems to not be upset. She was asking if that’s something I want to be called or if it’s a mistake and said she didn’t want to make me uncomfortable by asking me. Honestly it’s not a dead give away I’m trans but it’s still weird enough. Like to have colleges refer to me as something other than my legal name is weird if I just use the excuse that it’s a nickname or something other than being trans. I don’t know what to tell her because I was going to wait a lot longer before I told her. My step dad is transphobic and she has on occasion said some things transphobic as well. I don’t live with them though so I wouldn’t be risking my safety it would just kinda suck if she doesn’t accept me. Anyone have any advice?	"No advice, but here's my support.
I think you can be honest without fully claiming you're trans.

Sweeping anti trans bill passed in Kansas	"Even if Governor Laura Kelly vetos the bill as expected, the legislature passed it with a veto proof majority and will likely overturn it. This bill has explicit language classifying sex and gender as one and the same with no room for transition AT ALL. From the article: 
""However, the Kansas measure also covers prisons, jails, rape crisis centers, domestic violence shelters and other spaces “where biology, safety or privacy” prompt separate facilities for men and women. It defines male and female based on a person’s physical anatomy at birth.""
I know Kansas is a small state, but there are so many people who will be hurt by this."	"I hate this fucking state so much

I'm scared that I might be wrong	"This post is going to ramble a bit, I'm sorry about that, just...bear with me? I'm looking for some help answering one of the bigger questions that's been gnawing away at me for a while.

So, at this point, I'm probably about 70% sure that I'm a trans woman. But I still don't know for sure; there's still that 30%. If I'm right and I am a trans woman, I still probably won't actually transition for a few years because I want to keep my mother out of it (not because of any safety reasons, just because I don't want her involved), so I've got all this time on my hands. I think that's going to be a real problem, though. All that time is just going to give me more chances to doubt whatever conclusion I come to.

The main thing that is eating away at me is the possibility that I'm wrong. What if, in a few years, when I've moved out and I've reached the conclusion that I am trans...but that conclusion is wrong. What if I'm a cis guy who has convinced himself that he is a trans woman? What would happen? Can y'all help me out?"	"Hey there! I'm FTM, If it helps I've been questioning for about 5 years now. I do little when I feel comfortable to make myself feel better. I'm not jumping all in. Though there is a HUGE part of me that wants to. I want to do the hormones and have the surgeries. There's still a small part of me that wonders if it's real. So I do things for me. I just cut my hair in a masculine cut yesterday. It's amazing how awesome I feel just by doing that. 

For you, start small. Paint your nails. Do a clear polish if you aren't comfortable with colors. Have a nightly face wash regimine. This sounds dumb buy I would love to grow a beard...thats not possible now as I'm not on hormones yet. But I do shave my face quite frequently. It feels awesome to have a shaved face and to actually shave my face. 

You could also shave your legs or underarm hair or chest. People most likely won't notice or question it. BUT on the off chance they do, you can make something up. There are so many reasons to shave body hair off. 

Slowly start growing your hair out. I know lots of people (men and women) with longer hair. Again  most people may not notice and if they do, won't question it. If they do, you can always just say your trying to find a new hairstyle and leave it at that. 

These are all small changes you can do for yourself to see how you feel as you go. If doing these things make you feel better and better then you most likely are a transwoman. But truthfully labels don't matter. Just do what makes you feel the best you and if you choose to label it you can. Just don't feel obligated to label yourself.
I've never met a cis person that wonders ""What if I'm cis?"" Just saying 

And also. Just be you. You don't have to fit completely under a specific label, just be who you are. Do whatever feels most comfortable whether that's transitioning or not. When you make a decision, don't think of it as like ""oh I'm trans so I shouod transition"". Just do what feels right for you and forget the labels until you need them. 

Much love.
I can't tell you that everything is going to go as planned. But if you're 70% confident in any decision, you're doing better than most. Whether it be your gender or the school you go to or where you choose to live, 70% is a solid place to be.

Take a bit longer, think it through and you'll be fine.
I've given this some thought too.

There's is no pressure on anyone to do hrt or operations. 

It's a strange thing the idea of certainty, and questioning is probably a good thing and it can give you room to ask yourself questions and mind opinions and read in material thay can help you understand yourself.

Let's say you go a few years going be she her, wearing makeup and feminine clothing, and suddenly realize your a cis guy.  Well all that happened was you spend some time experimenting and learning about yourself, and there isn't any pressure to remain be trans.

Ofcause the thing is anyone who start asking these questions like does not entirely fill their assigned expectations, and since, as of yet, society gives you a gender and you are likely going to sit in thay role for a while.
But there's a whole spectrum and it isn't as simple as being simple as cis vs trans. 

The thing is the person you are today is not the person you are next year, and what you find is the truth for you will likely become more clear as you grow and learn.

I'm pretty sure I'm a woman, but I don't feel like diving in head first,  I'm trying to live as what I think I am, in attempt to be more true to who I am. And I feel more free and less like I'm just fulfilling others expectations, and this isn't just gender but education, work, live, life hobbies friends.

I always hated pants everyone did, but it turns out others don't hate them the same way.

Getting to know others is a great way to see how your different. I thought I was cis and now I slowly realize not just that I'm different from cis people, but also what they are.

Anyway I hope this was any help
Just be you, that's all, don't look at other trans people here and try to be like someone. Honesty, I am still questioning myself some moments, even though I am having hrt and I came out with many people. So I think that is ok. Some of my trans friends decide not to get grs. One of them even can't get hrt and plastic surgery due to health issues. 100% trans, 70% trans... whatever, they don't care much. They just know what they truly are and live happier than their past.

You may need more time to find out, give yourself time!

I want to say a lot but my English is not enough, ha ha, excuse me :p
I appreciate this.

But I'm essentially at the last step of the process. For the most part, I know what I like. I feel confident in how I express my gender, it's just a matter of answering that question. At this point it's really just that label that I'm looking for. I'm not really in a position to be experimenting or in a position where experimenting would help a whole bunch, it's just finding that final piece, that yes or no ""Am I trans?"".

I'm sorry to be so all over the place. I really appreciate your help here.
I appreciate this. I really do. Your kind words mean a lot to me.

But I keep hearing that phrase 'just be you' and it always gives me this sinking feeling in my gut. Having a specific label is the way that I'm trying to be me. I'm not saying to myself 'I'm trans so I should transition' I'm trying to decide whether or not to transition and to do that, I feel like I should find out if I'm trans. Does that difference make any sense at all? I'm not the best when it comes to...words and things.

But again, I don't want to make you feel like you're doing/saying something wrong. Thank you for the love and for the kind words. I'm sorry that I'm confusing.
Oh sorry about that!
No its OK. I understand what you're saying. I just think transitioning and being trans are two separate things and one shouldn't necessarily involve the other if it being so brings you so much stress. But if you can't separate the two in your head, then that's completely valid. I just thought a different perspective could help. I hope you find what you're looking for. 💙
Don't be! I'm the one who wasn't fully clear.
Thank you. That different perspective did help, no doubt. It's just that it wasn't what I was looking for at first. I should have made my thoughts more clear, that's on me.
I get it!! I'm still questioning and asking things constantly. In my head I know what I want to ask, but I can never fully get it out what I'm trying to say."	nm68vh	trans	7	1.0	2021-05-27 12:23:59
Beings trans in an islamic country	"I (16) recently found out I'm trans (MTF) last month, and I've started to come into terms with it. However,my environment isn't....good. In case my username wasn't obvious , I'm from egypt and being anywhere in the LGBTQ+ community is punishable by a prison sentence, and the prisons here are god fucking awful. I know a guy who's been in one of them, and he's changed drastically,not a good way at that.

So I've obviously been keeping this hidden to save my bacon. And words can not describe the amount of stress, anxiety, and depression this has been causing.
Being afraid of being found out, getting called my dead name, being misgendered, it all hurts. I have some very close friends online, but my chances of escaping for my own safety are grim at best due to how hard it is to acquire a new passport and ditch the Egyptian one. 

Overall, being trans in an islamic country is nothing but pain. I wish I could leave right now."	"I'm sorry you're going through that. I really hope something changes or you can get away from it. In the meantime sending big fluffy cuddles your way.
Can you leave the country after school, for studying?
Thanks for your support kind stranger, my situation really isn't good, but I try to manage. But I really can't control much
Won't be easy, also I can't afford it
Unfortunately not many of us have any true control. But you have the rare gift of knowing who you truly are inside. That is more precious than anything and all too rare in these times. My heart really does go out to you and all our sisters and brothers in places like that.
Maybe look out for some things like study abroad programs or exchange programs, they often provide funding in some kind of way. I got the idea because usually academics and general career building is a strong arguments for people who want to leave a place, as there are few arguments against it. And, once you are in a safe space, staying is always easier than escaping ftom an unsafe place.
The fact that we get punished for being ourselves and these countries get away with it sickens me to my core

Just came out to my mom. Love is a fickle thing	"I knew the response would probably be bad, but I had no idea how bad. I set up for it as well to cushion the blow for her and myself: I texted my sister to make sure she had just had a cigarette and coffee and wasn’t busy. I made sure I was back at my apartment across the state for safety. And yet…

She didn’t say anything to me directly. I was expecting questions on sex and gender and whatever, but instead she just listened until I mentioned wanting to transition and then hung up. According to my sister she started blaming my school and my therapist and said I wasn’t allowed in the house if I wasn’t a boy.

What’s also crazy is that she claims to be Christian, yet when my sister started explaining it in Bible terms (after I had been hung up on) she didn’t believe her.

Love is a fickle thing. Just earlier this week she was saying she loves me and asking how the train back was. Over Christmas she said how happy she was to see me. And just before I said I was trans, she said she was happy to hear from me."	"Friend, that's not love. Love is trusting you to know yourself better than anyone else can and accepting you no matter what changes you make. A loving parent that doesn't understand might ask questions about how transitioning would impact your health and safety. Hanging up on you and blaming outside forces for ""changing"" you before saying a changed version of you wouldn't be welcome? That sounds like a controlling parent.

Maybe between you and your sister, you can make her understand but there's no shame in keeping your distance either"	104kgrh	trans	7	1.0	2023-01-06 04:17:51
Coming out Message at Work	"Hey compadres,

I came out at work yesterday and it was positive experience. I would describe it as utterly terrifying as I just ripped off my safety blanket. But also relief; like 18 months' worth of pressure being steadily relieved which I'm still processing. One thing I found difficult was not knowing what to write and how to come out. For context, I work in the NHS (UK) in an office. I came out to close colleagues over the last 6 months and finally reached the point when I was ready to legally change my name and update my gender where possible.

So I worked with HR and my IT department to have everything updated this week but I still needed to let everyone know. I made the below message to email close colleagues, work friends, the wider department and people I'm in the middle of messaging, (about 150 people in total) to come out with my new name and pronouns. Happy for anyone to use this as a template and use your own details, it worked well for me and I felt it was a good balance between professional and thoughtful. I didn't realise how much of a burden it has been but I no longer have to hide who I am to the people I know and hold myself back - I hope it can help someone else out there

&#x200B;

""Hello Everyone,

Most of you know me as \[Deadname\], your \[My job role\]. I felt it was time to let you all know that I am transgender or more specifically, a transgender woman (male to female). As a small number of you already know, I began transitioning a little over a year ago, and now I'm in a position to finally come out at work.

May I ask that you please refer to me using my new name, Amelia and she/her pronouns. I realise this is a big change for people but I appreciate everyone's effort in respecting and supporting who I am.

I also want to assure everyone that I'm still the same person and fulfilling the same role, but as a woman. If you have any genuine questions about my transition, I'm happy to help and spread awareness, otherwise you can discuss it with my Manager, \[My manager's name\], also we have an LGBT+ network (Chair: \[Network chair's email address\]) in the trust that have some great resources about this. If you have found any of the terms in this message confusing, there is a handy list of LGBT+ terms on the [Stonewall Website](https://www.stonewall.org.uk/help-advice/faqs-and-glossary/list-lgbtq-terms) that you may find useful.

Is it weird that I (mtf, 29) still really enjoy shaving my face?	"Hey all. So I've not been on HRT long enough for shaving my face to be unnecessary, but I got to thinking about how this may be one of the only ""man"" things I miss as my transition continues.

From a young age, I got into wet shaving, collected different kinds of brushes and shave soaps, even learned how to use a straight razor (don't worry, I use a safety these days and trust that shite to the barbers lol). I guess in a sense it was a way to accessorize and escalate everyday grooming in a way that wasn't the ""masculine"" norm from my experience growing up.

Anyone else have a similar experience, or even just a random stereotypical ""man"" thing that they've got a sentimental attachment to? Or am I just an oddity"	"Uh, I don't think hrt removes facial hair at all. I thought it's one of those things that are permanent from a testosterone-based puberty just like the deeper voice is. I was always under the impression we girls would have to get electrolysis to permanently remove the facial hair. Am I wrong?
Girl, it's your body and you're living a subjective human experience. If you enjoy shaving, then that's amazing for you. It's good to find satisfaction in those little acts of maintenance. 

And I don't think it's weird to get joy from ""man"" things. Like, I can pull out a deep gravely voice from when I smoked. And I lowkey love the way it sounds when I sing in that voice.
Nah lol
I don’t think it’s weird at all, it seems like it’s just a part of your self care/skin care routine
you are mostly wrong. hrt won’t make facial/body hair go away COMPLETELY, but many trans women experience it massively thinning out after starting hormones, sometimes to the point of it being no longer noticeable. i used to have very thick, dark hair on my legs, and now if i don’t shave for a few weeks they get some thin, fine light hair
From what my doctor told me it won't remove it but will soften it somewhat and make the growth less noticeable? Are they off base here
Right, I could see that happening to leg hair. But facial hair is usually more concentrated, so I would think even with it thinning some, it will be noticeable.  Unless OP's facial hair isn't more concentrated like mine, I wouldn't think she would have to stop shaving
I must be one of the unlucky ones, I needed laser and my body hair hasn’t gotten any lighter or thinner even after a year and a half of hormones 😔
Oh they are correct. It will be softer and thin some, but it should still continually grow if you don't shave it.
i mean, the same exact thing happened to my facial hair, but i dunno, i’m not everyone. i can pretty much get away with not shaving my face now, though i still do it just because being able to feel facial hair on my face is uncomfortable for me, even if it’s very difficult to see
Huh, I guess I learned something new about it. Thanks for sharing! I legit thought it would only change the facial hair and not potentially make it entirely unnoticeable."	ssuc1h	trans	7	0.74	2022-02-15 04:27:10
"Amazon's ""Culture of Inclusion"" put me in a really uncomfortable spot."	"I work in an Amazon warehouse and it's a job and it's fine. I ended up having to go to safety to get my shoulder checked out (I have a pulled muscle and had a really bad knot, this isn't the main reason for this post)

So, one of the requirements when you get admitted is you fill out an incident report. Fair enough. A nifty thing in this is it has a little slot where you fill out your pronouns.
If it wasn't Amazon I'd give them a big high five but I'm not naive. 
My issue isn't that they had pronouns as an option.
My issue is that you're required to fill them in.
I'm not good at denying things. At all. This means when I was handed paperwork that asked my pronouns, I opted not to fill in the blank. I left it blank. Because for me, letting someone assume I'm a cis woman is easier than saying I am a cis woman (and safer than saying I'm a trans man). I feel sick when I have to fill out stuff and say female. I like the option of letting people assume whatever without me saying yes or no to one or the other.
I was forced to make a choice. And I can't say I'm a girl. I'm beyond that point. So, I begrudgingly checked the he/him box which means I was inadvertently backed into a corner about actively lying about myself or telling the truth in an environment where gauging how people will respond to that information could be potentially horrible. I'm partially out at work because I was basically forced to check a box I didn't want to check. 

Does this make sense to anyone else? I vented at my friends about this but I'm hoping to get some thoughts from some fellow trans I guess."	"""WE WILL INCLUDE YOU WHETHER YOU WANT TO BE INCLUDED OR NOT""  


Is not inclusion, it comes across a bit authoritarian to me. In cases like this there should always be a ""none of your damn business"" option

No, they are not overthinking this. You seemingly don't understand that someone was just accidentally coerced into outing themselves in a workplace they weren't prepared to out themselves in.

Is it common for feelings for your partner to change (pre-transition vs during/post-transition)?	"My partner (non-binary MAAB; 42)  has started to consider feminizing hormone therapy to help them achieve a more non-binary/feminine appearance. I (cis F; 36) had some initial concerns about safety and how it would affect our sex life, but I have mostly gotten comfortable after doing some more research on these topics. 

Part of what my partner is most excited for are the emotional/brain chemistry changes, and as they have been describing to me what they’ve read about from various trans women, it sounds like it is common for there to be significant changes in how people process thoughts and emotions pre-transition vs post-transition. 

So this has got me kind of scared…if all of my partner’s emotions are going to change, will they still love me? Will they still find me attractive? Will they still interact with me in the same way?

 I can get pretty comfortable with the idea of my partner’s body changing and I feel like I will still love them and grow to love and appreciate new things about their body. But what about me? Will they still be attracted to me once their hormones and brain goes through all these changes? 

I would love some guidance from anyone who has been through this. How did transitioning affect your existing relationship(s)? Did you lose interest in your partner? Did your emotional connection to them change? 

My partner says that they can’t imagine that they would feel differently about me, but also acknowledges that this process affects everyone differently and they really have no way of knowing the specifics of how HRT might change things between us. 

All experiences welcome — I recognize that some responses may not be the answer I am hoping for, but I think I need to be prepared."	"Maybe my anecdote can help— Afab & go by she/they. I think the first thing to think of is gender does not equal sexuality. For me, I am attracted to men and that hasn’t changed when I realized I was genderfluid. I recently had to go on birth control to help with some hormone imbalances I have and I was honestly pretty afraid that if I had hormonal estrogen in me that would either effect my genderfluidity or make me feel less attracted to who I’m attracted to and it really hasn’t, other than helping me not feel so low!

Although your partner may go thru some physical and hormonal changes from this, I really wouldn’t worry too much about it. They made a choice to love and be in a relationship with you for a reason, despite whatever gender they are.
I don't have statistical data to look at so maybe I am wrong, but if someone has changed to the point where thy don't love you anymore, it's not cuz of *those* hormones.I'd imagine an attitude change comes from breaking free from your shell. It's quite liberating. It seems to make plenty sense people would be happier and look at life in a new light.People also just naturally change over time too especially when coming from young - this itself can sadly kill many relationships, but also why they recommend not to get married so young.

So will they be different? Quite possibly. But different in terms of not caring about you anymore? I have my doubts. Assuming you guys aren't struggling with relationship issues as those are what would end it. But if you guys are happy together, chances are you can still be happy together after treatment if you're both cool with it.
GF (cis, 30), Me (MtF, 30), together 2 years now.

I'm a week and a half away from 4 months on HRT. My feelings for her haven't changed whatsoever and my personality has not changed. I'm no psychiatrist but in my opinion any loss of attraction and love for you on their end would mean that it was always just sexual attraction and love. Again I'm not a professional, it's just my thoughts on that matter. 


My GF and I are having less sex, mostly because of our work schedules but partly due to how the hormones are affecting my libido. It's not that I'm not attracted to her and it's not that it is difficult to ""get it up""; it's that getting into the mood is different now. Foreplay is going to be important. Since you are a cis-woman, think of things that you like and experiment to see if your partner likes any of it. 


Trying to stay PG here, but have you ever had a guy fail at trying to get you in the mood (or if you were kinda in the mood and they completely turned you off) because they were doing the wrong things? That's most likely gonna happen if you think that you'll be able to get your partner in the mood with rapid cranking.
From what I know and have experienced, HRT in general doesn’t change your emotions, it just changes how you feel them, if that makes sense. For example, people who take feminizing hormones may cry more often at things they find sad, or smile more when they feel happy, but it’s not the hormone making them happy or sad they just feel it stronger/ it manifests outwardly more. Meanwhile people on masculinizing hormones may experience difficulty crying in situations where they would have before, or more irritability at things they found mildly annoying before. Basically HRT tends to increase or decrease how strongly you feel or can express emotions, but isn’t necessarily responsible for the emotions themselves. (Also I should mention that estrogen can decrease libido and the ability to get hard/finish, and testosterone typically does opposite. So be aware that your sex life could change and you might have to be more creative or at least patient.)

However, some people on HRT might see changes in their personality, attraction, sexuality, etc, but that’s not due to the hormone it’s due to what it’s doing. Suddenly, this hypothetical trans person is feeling better about their body, they’re feeling sexy, they’re more aware of what they find attractive in others, they don’t have to uphold to the same standards they used to, they feel more free.

What I’m trying to say is, someone is still the same person before HRT as they are during/after it. But the HRT can raise them from 50% themselves to 100%. Idk if any of that makes sense, I hope it does. My partner has been with me since day 1 of mine and a year later our bond has grown stronger and stronger. If this is something your partner wants, support them through it. It’s very unlikely that they’ll lose feelings for you, and with feminizing hormones they may likely feel even stronger towards you. This is an understandable fear and an important think to know is a possibility going into it, but could just as (if not more) easily not happen, so don’t be paranoid waiting for it to happen cause then it probably will. Ride it out with em. Best of luck to you both
Thank you — I totally agree….remembering that we are both growing older and our bodies and temperaments are going to change with time regardless is what convinced me that I am comfortable with whatever challenges may lie ahead. 

LOVE your cute nerdy username, btw.
Thank you. Luckily “rapid cranking” was never my go-to move. 😅

 It’s reassuring to know that your feelings for your girlfriend haven’t changed with HRT. Thank you so much for your response!
Thank you. This is really helpful. I keep reading it over and over. ❤️
Hehe. Thanks! You're the first one to comment on it :p

Best of luck to you two on your journey! \^\^

What can I do to help people feel comfortable approaching me?	"Apologies if this is the wrong place to post this! 

I am a cis woman from the UK; I work in a public facing/visitor services role in a security capacity, and see hundreds or thousands of people a day. I am the person you approach if you need help or have any questions. This can be simple things but also extends to more serious incidents and queries (evacuation, conflict management, health/safety, and ofc responsibility to respect people’s privacy and wellbeing!) and I want to know if I can do anything to make people feel safe in approaching me. Especially since the UK is increasingly unwelcoming to trans/GNC people.

As it stands, I make an effort to use gender neutral language, and try and promote it amongst my colleagues, and I have a little trans flag pin a friend gave me attached to my lapel. But are there any things I should be aware of - either to do or to avoid doing - or are there any things people have noticed from other staff in visitor services that have stood out to them? I don’t want to be patronising or performative, and I can only apologise if this is an inappropriate question. I simply want to ensure that I am able to do my job effectively, and make sure people feel safe, comfortable and welcome to approach me if they need anything."		11r3z0s	trans	5	0.69	2023-03-14 11:47:16
Best States to move to	I currently live in North Carolina, and my mom advised that for my safety I should move somewhere else. I was thinking Northeast to Vermont or Maine or something along those lines, but where would I feel most safe and be able to get the most out of life?	"Northeast is generally always a good pick, I live in Connecticut and things are… decent here *if* you can afford it. I’ve never encountered hostility from strangers, and there are multiple good options for trans healthcare… if you can afford it. 

Things are really expensive here, unfortunately. I’ve heard good things trans-safety wise about the rest of New England too, so just be careful expense wise. If you’re all set on that front, the world (Northeast) is your oyster!

Do you prefer rural or urban living?
State of denial. No, that's the worst.
I was born and have lived in Michigan my whole life. I've traveled the states a lot and always come home. So my rec would be here, but I'm totally biased. Good luck! 🖤
Come to Asheville it's basically the LGBTQUIA+ capitol of North Carolina.
You should try to find a place near a city with lots of gay people, I live in NJ and Asbury Park is very gay. If you put gay after any city name you can see how many bars and events pop up. And healthcare is important like Vermont is pretty but New Hampshire is too and has Dartmouth college town and Dartmouth Hitchcock hospital
I’m so glad to run across this post. I’m hoping to move in the next couple years.  I’m currently thinking Vermont.
I recommend not Wisconsin, if it's not a bigger city like Green Bay, Appleton or Madison it's not that safe. The LGBTQ+ resources are sparse and the bigotry is everywhere. I agree with others, I've heard the Northeast isn't bad. I've also heard Colorado isn't bad either.
Don’t go to Utah. It’s a trap I moved here as a kid and before we knew it my family got trapped. It is surprisingly way over priced living here. 

And in recent years since tech company’s have been moving here it’s only gotten much worse. 

My family is trapped here financially and they only way we can hope to get out of this hell hole is if all of us put our money together and get really good remote jobs that will allow us to move and get out. My family has recently been thinking of the northeast (thankfully that’s a good spot) specifically the Great Lakes area but I heard from my inquiring post that the Great Lakes area isn’t that great.

I also hear Washington and Portland as long as you are west of the cascades are great places to be if you are LGBTQIA+.
(Western) WA, you can get decent gender affirming healthcare even if you're very poor and has a lot of queer people that look out for each other. It's like living in a bubble. There's been an entire trans pride event in addition to regular pride for years. Rent is rough though.
Come to California. No one even has the guts of saying homophobic shit here nowadays
I’m honestly good with either! Though I don’t prefer living specifically *in* the city, a place like NYC would not work for me
This. People have been so much more friendly since coming out. So many people come up to complement my toenails or shorts. It has been amazing
Ay there we go, we can bunk
I’m the same way. I like CT and Mass for the fact they’re somewhat urban but not too city like in most places. They also have spots of rural towns here and there, although western Mass is decently rural.

Vermont, New Hampshire, and Maine are *really*  rural, although each has spots of urban living near their biggest cities and/or state capitals. I couldn’t tell you anything about healthcare there though, but I’ve heard they’re pretty accepting. 

I’m probably not much help, because most of what I know is hearsay and my tiny experiences, but I hope at least it helps you gauge what you want a bit more. 

I hope you move someplace you love!

Muscle and other things (Other things and muscle?)	"I've been hypothesizing for a while that there might be two distinct veins of dysphoria. The first is that background dysphoria that a lot of us feel, the nagging feeling that something is wrong, the kind that generally goes away on HRT. The second kind is more conscious and comes when efforts are made to present a certain way but those efforts are hindered by perceived bodily faults. I've been trying to chip away at everything holding me back, (that I can actually address atm as there are significant financial hurdles to overcome in my case before I can do anything big), and I think that when you get to the point that you're dealing only with the second type of dysphoria and it's not stemming from the whole genital situation, you're essentially dealing with a problem everyone faces which is fitting into some societal ideal.   

I might change my mind later but right now I'm deciding not to deal with that type of dysphoria. I spent a decade trying to get over how sparse my facial and body hair is/was, \[funny how the moment I conclude that I don't need hair to be a man is the same point that I decide I don't want to be a man and simultaneously start growing hair (screw you, God/Hormone Monster)\], and the whole thing was stupid. I'm not about to put myself through that same mental torture over being ""too manly"" if/when I get to the point of presenting. Besides, there are some things I love about my current self. I climb and it's made me strong as heck, plus I figure if ( [https://www.pinterest.com/pin/426997608400953507/?autologin=true](https://www.pinterest.com/pin/426997608400953507/?autologin=true)) \[Alex Puccio\] can be powerful then so can I. I want to keep my ape arms if I can. I also like how wide my vocal range is, I'll shift my resonance when I speak but I don't want to get to the point where I feel I have to censor part of myself to sing or laugh, at least not when I'm in good company.

I get that for many people it isn't a choice what you feel bad about, and there's a strong chance that my feelings on all this might change in the future but if I ever get to the point where stealth is an option and not a necessity for my safety/mental health, I hope that I don't feel that I have to limit myself to fit in because these 20ish years and the parts of myself I've learned to love aren't a part of my life that I want to erase. Thanks for coming to my Ted talk :)"	"I think that the second one is more an issue of bodily dysmorphia due to societal norms of gender and that when we try to break those societal norms of gender by presenting as the gender that we were not assigned ta birth, those societal norms come and kick us in the ass.

Something that bugs me about running	"*Note:  this is discussing a future in which Republicans are able to take their transphobic agenda to the federal level in a violent way, i.e. Trump or DeSantis with a red Congress.  This future is of concern but far from certain.*

So, if we see the writing on the wall and decide to run, that is perfectly valid.  Every one of us deserves a good life with loving people.  Do not take this as an argument for staying in the U.S. even if things turn really sour.  I want you safe.

The frustrating thing though is we're not an ethnicity.  If America went literal Nazi repeat and targeted Jewish people, I would say yeah we need to get Jewish people and their children out of the country.

The problem is that a trans person can be born to anyone.  You cannot just move all the trans parents to safety and then have all new trans kids be born somewhere safe, obviously it doesn't work like that.  So thinking about what my actual line beyond which is ""gtfo"" would be, it feels like a harder calculus.  Like, should I wait until there's nothing I can do for other members of America's trans population?  Until there's too great of a threat to my own life?  Should I stay in my home of Washington unless my state either gives up on defending us from the feds or turns on us?

The fact that we would be absolutely guaranteed to ""leave people behind"" makes me literally nauseous thinking about it."		10tcz8p	trans	6	0.87	2023-02-04 10:17:44
I have to come out to all of my coworkers because Allied Universal’s primary tool forces use of legal name	"I’m a security guard, and today we began using the company’s latest reporting tool (that they’re pushing hard nation wide). It’s only capable of using your legal name (it pulls from the employee database where legal name must be accurate for tax purposes etc). Everyone at my site, and the neighboring sites we work with, is now using this. At the login screen, there’s a list of everyone’s legal names. All daily log events have legal name on them, and they are shown to other officers, especially the ones following each shift. Thusly, I have to tell everyone what my legal name is, which of course is a gender mismatch. Apparently I pass better than I thought, and it is coming as a surprise to some.

Because I live in a trans friendly place, and am not stealth, this is mostly just an inconvenience for me, and I’ll have to clear up all the confusion. I don’t feel this jeopardizes my safety and I know people will continue to respect my current name. (side note: their company email address policy is the same, so I’ve already had to explain this to some of the ones I work for and work with)

But this being used nation-wide, it definitely will have consequences – possibly life or death – for many others who need or want to not use their legal name, trans or not.

Locally, the company is very trans friendly. But it seems like such an oversight for the corporate development team to decide everyone going by their legal name was a good idea, especially after the lessons Facebook learned from their real name policy.

Does anyone else work for Allied and face this?"	"Sounds like the perfect motivation to get that legal name change done. But yeah, that sucks.
I'm so glad I don't work in security anymore. With the people I worked with (and especially the ones who worked under me for the brief time I was a supervisor), this would have been a major issue.
It is not financially accessible, and even if it was, there are other reasons I do not want to do that *yet*. Similar to how Muhammad Ali never legally changed his name because he saw no need to “go according to the white man’s law”, I do not feel like I should have to buy the privilege of being addressed by my name. And quite frankly, I want to see at what point my driver’s license will be rejected when I get carded, if I am ever able to pass that well."	usrxn6	trans	5	0.86	2022-05-19 01:22:07
My Tragic Backstory lol	I realized I was trans when I was 21. I came out as a man a little tentatively at 22. I wasn't confident or assertive about it, but I really tried to physically transition and took testosterone for almost a year. But I ran out and didn't have access anymore. I kinda mentally spiralled and went back in the closet. It wasn't hard because nobody in my life used my male name or pronouns. They actually just kinda ignored my coming out like it never happened, making me second guess myself and feel crazy. Everybody pretended it never happened for three years. Now I'm 27 and I've come back out to my friends, none of which live nearby but all of which are supportive. Now it's time to come out to my family who I actually see IRL. I know the mistake I made before was being a doormat and never correcting anyone. Now I'm just trying to mentally prepare myself to do this and do it confidently. I'm not expecting any overt anger or risk to my safety, mostly just disregarding my gender completely. Any advice on how to do it would be much appreciated since I'm starting to second guess if I really am so much stronger and more confident like I thought I was lol	"I 100% feel this post. I'm in different circumstances but the family aspect of things is definitely the toughest. 


Ideally, I would say if it's uncomfortable for them in the beginning, if you stand your ground and do you, maybe they'll come around and see you're happier, etc. and realize you're still you, just the most authentic version. 

I know family is like super fickle though sometimes, and coming from a primarily conservative, mostly religious family myself, it's definitely daunting, and something I am heavily thinking about myself right now. 

Whatever you decide to do, definitely good luck and I hope that you can find the best way to do what makes you happy.

Coming out	"Hello everyone, my name is Geileis (for pronunciation, please see my Reddit nick 😘).

TRIGGER WARNINGS: I’m not sure yet what to be cautious of, so I’m going to let my social work training caution out some things. My story contains themes of resolving a splintered identity, personal denial, sub/dom, repressed memories and their realizations.

I’ve been living with an identity inside me for 38 years that I was too afraid to embrace, or I had just been too young to realize her. Because she was primarily my gaming identity, I had recently chosen a nickname for her. After 20 years of running from relationship to relationship, trying to find why I couldn’t fill this hole inside me, I was about to find out why.

About two weeks ago, I had connected with a fun buddy to get my mind off of things after a particularly devastating ending to another relationship. I had already begun plumbing my mental depths since it had ended about a month ago, and I figure I should try embracing my feminine and/or sub side (my ex wife had pointed it out, but I was too ignorant to know what she meant at the time. I wasn’t toxically masculine, I just didn’t understand that submissive didn’t mean you were a pushover; an issue I wrestled with my whole life).

Things are way more fun, but we started having a conversation about Geileis, and how I had an image of her in my mind, but I felt silly. She told me not to feel silly, it’s a part of me regardless of if she’s real or not. I felt compelled to describe her stoic but peaceful and warm nature, and was scrambling for people to describe her… 

One thing led to another, and I remembered a movie that I recall loving to death, but the rating wasn’t very high, so I was sitting there trying to recall why I was so drawn to recommend it, and why I was so compelled to bring it up in connection with Geileis’ personality. Before I knew it, I had a repressed memory fizzle into existence right before my mental eyes, and a game of “controlled detonation dominoes” ensued in my mind, digging up memories about the different times she’d showed up in my life.

When my life was at my worst, my old self credited me with getting him through, hauling him through the fire and battle around him to safety.

I wrote a letter to myself while it was still fresh… and honestly, from the bottom of my heart, I told myself  “I love you.” For the first time in my life, the hole is filled.

For the first time in my life, I feel complete.

For the first time in my life, I see my future. 

For the first time in my life…

…I am free.

Name change.	"I came out in November of 2019 as transgender. Since then, I've been living my life as a man, and even started testosterone at the end of last November. When I came out, I took the name Alex; it was easy to remember, convenient, and a simple enough name. I know, I know, it's a go-to for a lot of trans folks, particularly trans men. That's not really my problem with it.

It's neutral. I loved it for the first 8 months, but after moving in withy boyfriend, and hearing it constantly rather than once in a blue moon when my grandmother remembered, (TBI when she was a kid, not her fault at all and not out of malice, she just forgets.) I realized it's not for me. Looking back, I think I picked it out of a need to be more androgynous for my own safety, rather than because I thought it fit. Sure, once in a while, someone will call me Xander, but even that nickname feels incorrect.

I have an appointment with the local LGBT center on the 19th to begin the process of legally changing my name. (Fully funded by them, btw, which is mind blowing.) I have a name that I think I love, that's masculine and fits me, and makes me feel good about myself when others use it. My big problem, and why I'm coming here to seek guidance, is that I don't know how to breach the change with the people in my life outside my partner and my youngest sibling, who is nonbinary themself. I don't want the judgement, or the assumption that 'oh, he's going to be doing this every year' or what have you.

Has anyone gone through something similar? How did you go about letting others know that you were going by a different name after already being out and on hormones?"		m180sq	trans	6	1.0	2021-03-09 14:54:02
Are there people who know they are trans but present cis and are fine with it?	"For context, I grew up as a tomboy, who never really fit into gender norms except for playing I guess more ""girly"" video games and played with dolls, which honestly doesn't matter that much, I was a kid.

I went through a lot of trauma and also was the youngest and the only daughter at that point, so I really have tried to cling to that identity. My parents always expressed ill feelings toward LGBTQIA+ people, and someone in my family came out to my mom for me when I was 12/13 which put me in a really bad situation.

As I started going through puberty more, I started wanting to dress really masculine (and use a binder) and go by a different name (only when I was around my friends.) I chose my brother Jake's name because he is someone I really admire and aspire to be like. I chose a last name for myself. I was very happy in that identity, even if only I got to be that person very little.

Things got a little out of hand though. I was very insecure in my identity. I started using one of my other brother's pictures from his teenage days to catfish people on Facebook, and an online game I met strangers through. I knew this was wrong but I genuinely wanted people to see me as a boy. I didn't want to be Sarah. I wanted to be Jake and a boy. But I told myself no one would ever believe that I was a boy, so I used my brother's pictures. And I still regret it to this day. But I have no idea if that was a manifestation of dysphoria or gender incongruence or a cry for attention due to aforementioned trauma.

Eventually, I grew out of it, I think, but there's always these lingering feelings of what would be different if I had any idea about gender and such when I was that age. For additional context, I'm 22 now so 9/10 years ago this happened.

I am hesitant to explore these residual feelings because my sibling came out as trans and my dad pretty much disowned them. I am so proud of her for being her authentic self but I don't have the bravery it feels like. 

The people I live with (my bfs family) besides my boyfriend all regularly use slurs and invalidate trans people which if I say anything about it, it'll get us kicked out. Let alone if I came out, haha.. I honestly don't know if my partner would remain with me (romantically as least, he would stay with me because of his own reasons) bc he is straight. So I settled with the label of gender non conforming, nonbinary, genderfluid, words that make me feel more disconnected than anything from my gender, and even that I do in secret. 

And what's worse is every time I get on tiktok these videos with the audio ""Just know that if you hide, it doesn't go away"" with people who have transitioned makes me feel so alone and afraid. I am so genuinely happy for these people but it scares me.

I know I should probably see a gender therapist but I honestly don't know if that will help. Anyway, I guess the question is, is it possible to be trans, know you're trans, but present cis and be happy for your own safety? Or maybe have a small amount of people who know and just not medically/socially transition?

Anyway, I'm sorry for this long-winded post, and if anything was offensive I am genuinely sorry. I appreciate anyone who has the spoons to give me any advice or support."	"First of all I’m so sorry about your family situation. That sounds really tough to deal with ❤️

It’s possible. Though I don’t think there’s any kind of guarantee of happiness. A lot of people have similar situations and choose safety first, which makes sense. But I don’t think that should necessarily be the end of it. The ultimate goal in most cases would probably still be to transition. I mean the feelings of anguish at not being perceived how you want to be, and not feeling or looking like yourself, those won’t ever go unless you transition. 

Transitioning (whatever form that takes, it doesn’t have to include medication or surgery) is the ONLY way to deal with dysphoria and other trans issues. 

I’d recommend a therapist. If you find a good one they can really help you to decide for yourself what’s best for you. As all of us have slightly different journeys 😊

It’s hard to tell trauma apart from dysphoria/gender issues sometimes. That’s where a therapist helps. 
But I know I and a lot of other trans people ‘catfished’ or at least presented as different to our assigned gender at birth, online, as teenagers. 

It sounds like in a way you already did start to socially transition around friends. You changed your name, wore a binder… Maybe that’s a good start, present as you want to in places you know are safe, and remain in ‘girl mode’ other times. Also being yourself more in the safe places might help you to figure out what if any label fits (though you sound pretty sure your trans). 

As to your partner, I think it might be worth asking specifically about those worries on r/asktransgender ? I see a lot of those kinds of questions there, and someone might be able to help you figure these things out.

Hope this helps!
Thank you for your answer, it means more to me than you know! I guess I just really am afraid more than anything to even just explore the idea that I am trans (even if I'm not) due to everything that's happened. I definitely want to talk to a therapist or maybe just find a friend group that accepts me and that let's me be myself. I don't really have that anymore, unfortunately.

My childhood friends were so accepting of me back then even though we were all sheltered and hidden from the entire community. I felt so safe around them and I hope I can find that kind of peace within another friend group someday.

At the very least I am pretty sure I am not cis, and I really hope to find out who I am meant to be!

Again thank you for taking the time to respond, I know my question was long and trauma dumpy and I appreciate you!
That’s ok, I hope you find the support you need 😊"	rowl4u	trans	5	0.78	2021-12-26 13:06:04
Help for a friend	"Hello. I'm not sure if this is the right place to ask, but I'm looking for some advice. This isn't for me, but for a friend. Basically I want some advice on how to support her. This has been something giving her trouble for a while, with one issue in particular being her mother who kept asking questions like ""are you SURE you're trans?"", and kept turning the issue around to discussions of safety and trans issues, which in turn has caused her to doubt herself and worry over whether her mother was really accepting or not. So I just want to know how I can help her feel better, basically. Also, if anyone knows any good trans spaces online, that would be good as well. I remember her mentioning how she's had a hard time finding some places where she just express herself and have some other trans individuals to talk to. Just remember that she's a bit socially distant and sometimes has a hard time putting herself out there. Again, sorry if this isn't the place to ask. I just wanted some advice."	"I dont have much advice. Definitely just reminders that she's valid and only she can decide who she is and figure that out. He mom's opinion shouldn't change who she is. Good luck 💕
honestly, this is probably one of the more honest places to get advice. send her here, and always let her know she matters to you.   
We're our own worst critics, regardless of anything.  
that was one of the hardest things for me. i knew what i knew, but always had this fear in the back of my head. like a lingering...""you sure about that?"" i've always been cynical in nature, and figuring out who i was took a long time.  
I've been lucky, but i can see where it is a big step....because it is. With that said, you should always be you. it is...i don't want to say accepted or expected, but ..there are some who just don't get it.  


If you care enough to post on her behalf, you obviously care. just be there for her, do your best, and always stay positive. We're here for her and you as well.   


You are strong. you are loved.  
Chin up!
Thanks. I’ll do what I can
I know, it's just she's also suffering from depression and has talked about wanting to just ""go away"", and I guess I'm just worried. Like I don't know what to do. Thanks for the help, though. I'll try to see if I can get her to come here just to look at the place, but I'm not sure if I'll be successful. You have a nice day."	k09t50	trans	6	0.8	2020-11-24 17:46:09
I need help finding information to convince my parents to give me hrt	I'm mtf and trying to get hrt, or atleast hormone blockers, but I'm having trouble convincing my parents, and my therapist isn't helping with getting it, or atleast proving that I have serious gender dysphoria and not just a phase, especially because I live in a southern state. I've had signs of gender dysphoria my whole life, but my parents still don't want to get hrt because they're afraid it'll affect my health negatively, or I'll change my mind. They think that if I go on hormone blockers I could get brain damage or something because hormones control body functions, they say that the majority of people who transition regret it, and also that these feelings are being caused by something else. I know that this information isnt true but they have different sources that say it is, and when I say other sources say otherwise, they dismiss it, saying its probably made by a company that profits from trans products. I don't know any sources that I could use to help convince them so if anyone has any sources on the safety of hrt, how most trans people don't detransition and are happy with their transition, and other information relevant to this, it would help	"It sounds to me like they are unfortunately suffering from confirmation bias, and that regardless of what is given to them, they probably won’t change their mind. That being said, here are a few sources that might be a good start? 
This is pretty un-biased, and while it might not be make your parents immediately agree, it is a pretty fair and true source for what puberty blockers actually do. https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/gender-dysphoria/in-depth/pubertal-blockers/art-20459075

This seems generally useful https://www.acog.org/womens-health/faqs/health-care-for-transgender-teens

And finally, be aware that is your parents are pretty right wing or conservative, vox is known as a pretty, “left wing biased” news site, but if nothing else it might help you get the words you need to talk to them in a way they will understand, even if you don’t necessarily show them this article. https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.vox.com/platform/amp/2018/10/22/18009020/transgender-children-teens-transition-detransition-puberty-blocking-medication

I know all of this probably isn’t that helpful, but I really Hope you get healthcare you need, and I hope some of these help even just a little!!
You don't say how old you are. 
I would try to concentrate on puberty blockers since, depending on your age, your body is about to go through some changes that can't be undone without surgery. 
Personally, as an older person now, I can't imagine someone young making this big a decision, to transition.  Some people are sure very early that they want to transition. I totally understand your parents side. 

No doctors are going to do a surgery on a young person anyway. Hrt is different and doctors will do it later in the teens . 

Puberty blockers are a good compromise for you and your parents. You will be able to stop those changes in your body AND give your parents the assurance that it's not just a phase. Once you become a legal adult, you can get hrt.

Family issues	"I never asked to be trans. I never asked for any of this. Yet my mom and the rest of her side of my family treat calling me Cass or using she/her as an option, or a switch they can flick on and off whenever I'm not around. At the end of the day I don't care if they don't use my name and pronouns behind my back, i can't force them to but I've been publicly transitioning for 3 years now and my grandma can't even get she/her right on command and even when she corrects herself, it's only after I'm visibly uncomfortable and it's too little too late. 

Even my mom isn't perfect because while she gets my name and pronouns correct in front of me, it's very obvious that it's like a switch to her that she can flick off whenever I'm not around. Don't get me wrong, I have so much respect for my mom lowering her pride and ego enough to do that. I know where she lies politically and religiously, so the fact that she has those beliefs but respects me enough to use my name and pronouns around me shows me there's love in her heart. Unfortunately it's just not enough because she doesn't think I'm a woman, it's only an option to her, and as for every other trans person they're just groomers and she's actively voting for legislature to restrict trans rights for minors. Is it a coincidence that this is the same woman who helped force me back into the closet for 3 whole years back when i was minor? This isn't about the safety of children, this is about stopping them from becoming what she doesn't like and it's very clear she views me as the exception, as ""one of the good ones""

she won't support my surgery in any way, even though she doesn't work a job and could be perfect help around the house while I'm bed ridden and recovering. her excuse is that she might go back to work, despite the fact that other than some admittedly admirable volunteer work, she hasn't had a job in 4 years. This isn't me trying to slam her for not getting a job as I admire her volunteering and using her nursing skills, but rather this is me saying it's just a lame excuse to get out of helping and supporting me when I need it just because she's uncomfortable with the operation. It's an inconvenience, and I can work around it, but the fact of the matter is I'm not asking her to look at it or touch it, just to help me around the house while I recover and i know damn well if it was any other surgery, say i got in a car crash and was bed ridden while my legs recovered, she'd be more than willing to help.

All this to say that I don't hate everything about my mom, but it's very clear she would be overjoyed if I went back into the closet and pretended to be her little boy she was given. In her words when i first came out 3 years ago, she yelled at me while crying ""God gave me a son! I will never have a daughter!"" which broke my heart because while she says Cass and she/her she's never acknowledged me as a daughter and shows visible cringe while saying it. She doesn't love me for who i am.

I don't need my family, at the end of the day my step mother is way more supportive and nurturing than my own mother and as soon as I'm in a position to, I'm cutting my mom and her side of the family out of my life until they choose to accept and love me for who I am. I have a step mom and step siblings, I have a wonderful loving and supportive fiancé who has my back ride or die. I don't need my family but it hurts knowing they don't love me."	"Sounds like to me you have all the family that you need..
I don't know. I'm not close with my sisters or my step mom, and I'm deeply ashamed of that. I argue with my real mom all the time and she uses the R slur to my face, even acknowledging she does it because it upsets me. I have had positive interactions with her but even in them I'm walking on eggshells hoping we don't leave angry at each other"	ymerwv	trans	6	0.88	2022-11-05 00:09:55
anyone know a way to dye hair that can be hidden?	Hi, so I'm currently in the process of transitioning and I would like to dye my hair or do highlights but im scared of being judged at work. I have long hair and have to have it in a bun anyways for safety so i was wondering if there's a style that colors my hair without being noticeable while in a simple bun. Thank u in advance!	"well i’m not an expert about hair dye and all, and changing you hair colour would be pretty noticeable, wouldn’t it? haha, hmm, i have dyed my hair once, more of added dark red highlights that are only noticeable under the sun (i have no idea what hair colour you have, i have black so i could do that) but it’s a suggestion ^^
I have dark brown hair so that might work. Was hoping while in public it's a subtle way to show I'm in the community. My work technically allows colored hair but I've seen how my coworkers talk about trans people and there's been off hand comments about cutting my hair from my bosses. As long it's up in a bun there's nothing they can do about my hair length though because it's not a safety issue while up."	wstlzw	trans	7	1.0	2022-08-20 00:34:13
