In-laws showed up to our door unannounced after learning I am trans (MtF)	"Some background before I begin, my wife and I have been together for 8 years and married for 3. Her parents are incredibly conservative, outwardly racist and clearly homophobic. They do not know we are married; it was a courthouse marriage done for paperwork reasons, and we plan to have our 'real' wedding later. Her parents do not know this, as my wife assumed they would not take it well. For the last few years I have been on a bit of a process of self discovery, which led to the realization that I am trans, and I began HRT about 7-8 months ago. My wife and I have talked a lot about our relationship and the challenges and changes that transitioning can bring about, and we are happier now than ever, and plan to stay together.

&#x200B;

This past Sunday, my wife decided (after months of planning) to finally tell her mom about me transitioning on her weekly phone call. We expected this to go poorly, and our expectations were met. Basically, they don't view trans people as people, and don't believe that it would be possible for us to ever be happy together. Her mom was convinced that I would leave her for a man, highly unlikely given that I'm a lesbian (and we're married). Her mom cut her out of the family, saying anyone who wants to be with a trans person can't be a part of her family. Obviously this was sad and disappointing, but not unexpected.

&#x200B;

Monday (the next day) was my wife's birthday, so I made her meals and gave her gifts when she wrapped up working from home that day, a little before 5. We had just finished unwrapping when there was a knock at the door, and I saw her mom's frizzled hair from the window. I was in running shorts and a t-shirt with no bra, no makeup, and no shower after working out, so in no way fit to talk to people who have never seen me as a woman. Mind you, they also live 60-90 minutes away, so this was clearly a planned trip. When my wife answered the door, they walked right into the house and demanded to speak with both of us immediately. I was hiding in our laundry so as not to be seen, and begged my wife to make them wait outside or in their car for 10-15 minutes while I got ready. Eventually they moved to our front porch, where they stood staring into the windows.

&#x200B;

I went upstairs, tried to calm myself and change clothes, then went down to deal with them. They were waiting on the front porch, and when I opened the door to walk out, they refused to back up or give any room, so we were extremely close to each other. Now, I will tell you, I had kinda always expected something like this. I have never shared that I am very progressive in my politics, but over the years I have known them, they have always worked to push my buttons. I typically don't speak when we are all together, and they have never seen me actually behaving like myself. Tbh, they have no clue who I really am, and never cared to know. I figured one day they would push me over the edge, but I always thought I would be able to control myself and my emotions. Please know, dear reader, that when I tell you what happened next, that I have no hate for people who alter their appearance for happiness. Clearly, I am willing to do the same, given the amount of HRT, hair removal, and makeup I go through on the reg. But when I opened that door and stepped outside, the first words out of my MIL's mouth were, ""Nice breasts"". Almost immediately and without thinking, I scoffed and said, ""Well, at least mine are real.""

&#x200B;

So that's how the conversation started. Everyone gasped and took a step back (except me, since my back was already on the door). I think she was extremely taken aback, as she has never known me to talk back, nor do I think she was aware that I knew she had a boob job (they're not big). But I think it surprisingly made everyone calm down a bit, as she realized she wasn't ready for an insult fight. For the next 5-10 minutes, she talked about how we are terrible, lying children, and could never understand the pain we were causing her as a mother. They said that there was no way my wife could make the decision to stay with me, as she couldn't view it objectively since she was in a relationship with me. They tried to convince us not to get married (bit late on that one, lol) because, as they put it, ""it's only a 50-50 shot this even works out"", and that I couldn't decide until I'd ""finished all that transition stuff"". They said it was fine for me to decide to live a perverted lifestyle myself, but immoral to bring their daughter into it, and that my wife's mother had the right to tell her what to do. My wife was amazingly calm, and made it clear that she could make her own independent choices as an adult, and that we were very happy together. All the calm logic in the world wouldn't help, though, as my MiL is nuts.

&#x200B;

Then came the real anger. My MiL said that her sister was threatening to strangle me with her bare hands, and to 'just wait and see what happens when I tell the rest of the family'. She then took out some cheap-ass dishware that I assume she was going to give as a gift, and started throwing it on our porch to break, screaming that this is what I was doing to her family and her mind. She said that her mind was broken, and that she couldn't control what came out of it, and that I should be worried for what that might mean for me. After breaking all the dishes (or trying, she isn't very strong so some of the dishes survived), she said ""clean up your mess"". I responded that it wasn't my mess, it was hers, but that since I was a reasonable adult that I would clean it up for her, and not call the cops if she left. That really got her going, as she started screaming that she was not afraid to go to jail, that I should call the cops and see what happens. At this point, her husband, who had remained relatively calm, began to physically drag her away to their car whilst saying, ""you promised not to go crazy... You promised not to lose your mind!"" She was raving the whole way to the car, foaming at the mouth and all. Not a pretty sight.

&#x200B;

We cleaned up the dishes and tried to decompress after. In hindsight, I'm super glad we made her leave the house before talking to her, as she clearly had planned this to happen in our home. I think she probably would have broken our own possessions as well, given the lack of control she had. I was extremely proud of my wife for handling herself so well, and surprised at my own lack of control in the moment. Guess the lesson is that it's really hard to control 8 years of pent up anger, harder than I would've thought. Luckily, I only responded in kind, and never even thought of getting physical or yelling. We haven't heard much else from them, other than one ""damn her"" text from the MiL on the way home (which, honestly, props for using the correct pronouns, I wasn't expecting that). We have been cut out of any wills, family events (thank god, they sucked), or contact, but since we never relied on them for money or anything else, there's no real effect here. Now I won't have to plan and pay for their funerals when they die.

&#x200B;

PS- I have nothing against anyone getting a boob job. If I weren't happy with mine, I'd totally consider it, but for some reason my mouth managed its own response in this situation.

&#x200B;

TLDR: Angry parents ambushed us at our house, screamed and broke things until they were dragged away. They ended up looking like fools, and we're still a happily married couple.

&#x200B;

Edit: My wife filed a police report yesterday, we may pursue a no contact order or something similar, but we have put up a security camera and arranged some pepper spray around the house for quick and easy access. Naturally, if I ever hear from her again, I will update all of you accordingly!"	"Proud of both of you for handling yourselves the way you did. It's very brave to stand your ground especially around parents. So I commend you on your strength. I'm also happy to see your positive takes from this experience. Though I am sad that this is something you two had to deal with. Thank you sis for sharing this. I think it speaks volumes to those that are looking for the courage to be their authentic selves. Hugs and kisses. All the best on your ""wedding day"". My wife are in a similar boat on that front. We married in the courthouse for papers and our love as we couldn't wait, and have our 'wedding' planned for this September. No more taking off my wedding band. It hurts so bad to hide that.
Whoa, that's literally the craziest thing that I've read in a while!

You should think about posting this to r/insaneparents.
Omfg ""at least mine are real"" best response lol
Yeah the MiL needs‚Ä¶ something‚Ä¶ probably a psychiatric hospital stay if I‚Äôm honest. Yikes.

So glad you two are okay! üíô
> ‚Äú*props for using the correct pronouns*‚Äù

I lol‚Äôd

These guys are nuts, hope you and your wife are okay OP.
Honestly fuck your FIL for driving your MIL all the way there with plates to smash and then trying to say ""you promised not to go crazy"" like he didn't know exactly what she was going to do. He just wants someone else to blame when he dies alone in a cut-rate retirement home
As someone about to get top augmentation surgery, I personally gotta say I nearly pissed myself laughing imagining your quick and witty response, don't feel one bit bad about it.
I would have lost my shit when she stormed into the house. 

I used to be incredibly patient. This story only validates why we shouldn‚Äôt tolerate anything. Long before she appeared on your doorstep unannounced she made it clear she doesn‚Äôt respect either of you. 

I would call the police, and at least file a report. It would be nice to have that on record in case it happens again. Tho I would imagine when her local police knock on her door, and explain what she did wrong, it will most likely stop her from doing this ever again. If you don‚Äôt, she will most likely come back and do it again. Maybe even behave worse.
You're calmer and you're wife is calmer than I'd ever be if someone insulted my fianc√©e for being trans. Time for a restraining order! I doubt this is the last time MIL will go bonkers on your doorstep. Expect more. What a nut job. Sounds like my fiancees birth mom! We cut contact with her.
Good for you and your wife!  You are both so lucky to have each other.  

TBH you should probably report her uttering threats to the police anyways.  At the least they will go over to her house and put a little fear into her rage driven brain, and create a paper trail if anyone does ever try physical violence.  Don't underestimate crazy, it's always worse than you think.

My wife and I are in a similar position.  I haven't come out to anyone but my wife, and both our parents are religious.  My dad is fairly progressive but her parents are openly racist, sexist, homophobic, hateful people who only like people who are exactly like them.
[deleted]
Doubt I would have been able to remain calm in a situation like that, super impressive. May you and your wife's relationship only get stronger through this.
Wow. That's incredible, but sadly too believable. The nerve of them to do this on her birthday. Y'all handled it awesomely. I sincerely hope to demonstrate the same strength if ever forced to deal with something similar. Good for the both of you, stay strong and solidarity!
Proud of you and your wife standing up for yourselves

They can suck an ass for the way they treat you but you are valid no matter what :) üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Honestly this is pretty comedic, makes it clear who‚Äôs really the problem. Sorry you‚Äôre having to go through all this though ! Glad you have such a sweet supportive wife üíñ
And transphobes will say trans people are mentally ill


Sheeeeesh üôÑ



In all seriousness I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through something like that, at least the trash took itself out though.
Proud of your wife and you for not putting up with the MIL's bull, and your initial comeback had me cackling. It's hard to stand up to family sometimes, but it seems like your wife and you are a great support to each other, so I guess it's easier that way.
Stay safe, OP, and congrats on the two of you getting that kind of toxicity out of your life. Much love to you both!
‚ÄúAt least mine are real‚Äù
*GREAT ENEMY FELLED*
About the boob job comment‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm enby and took HRT briefly. A relative told me changing how I looked was not god‚Äôs plan. She had a breast reduction surgery the previous month since it was causing her back pain. And I looked at her and said ‚Äúwell god didn‚Äôt plan for you to have smaller breasts but that didn‚Äôt seem to stop you‚Äù
You get all the hugs OP. Way to stick it out. And a little bit of sass looks good on you girly
I think you handled it nicely. I want to encourage you to stay nice towards them. They can treat you like shit but they can‚Äòt force you to dirty your hands as well.
I'd get a restraining order against them lol.
I kept expecting a ""and that's when [you/your wife] punched the bitch in the mouth,"" turns out you're more composed than me!
She sounds like a  grandiose narcissist, I love the dish she brought to demonstrate what you are doing to her. She says you are doing this to her family but she really means herself and her idea of what a family is. 

You handled yourselves perfectly, that one smart retort about her fake breasts put her back on her heels, she was not expecting that at all.. why ? Because she felt so %100  confident in her moral highgound she was thrown by your calling her on her imperfect world
I hope you both have endless happiness out of spite for such lowly creatures that shouldn‚Äôt even be compared to human.
This makes me so angry. Hopefully you can go no contact.
""At least mine are real""  
GOD THAT'S AMAZING

you go girl, don't feel bad about it, i probably would have said something worse
Ummm‚Ä¶ If I ever become so narcissistic and bigoted that I hop in a car, ambush my daughter and try to destroy her relationship ON HER *FUCKING* BIRTHDAY, please dump me into a pool of lava. The sheer audacity of this woman, good grief.
You promised not to go crazy! You promised not to lose your mind!

ü§£ Poor guy he probably just wanted to stay home and watch some sport ball too
that was really great and satisfying to read.
well done
Whoa. Great job keeping yourself together. I don‚Äôt know how I would react in that sort of situation. Also, nice burn!
You need to get no contact orders of protection against the entire family asap. They will try this again. They will step it up. They are insane, violent, and very dangerous.
Wow that's fucking insane!

Side note: I enjoy the way you wrote everything down. You reminded me of a character in a book , in a good way.
1. Proud of you for responding this way!! As calm as I am generally, if my MiL (or my own mother) acted liked that, I‚Äôd be hysterical.

2. I don‚Äôt think a response to ‚Äúnice boobs‚Äù (I rolled my eyes so hard when I read that) required anything more polite that how you put it. 
Don‚Äôt dish it out if you can‚Äôt take it!
Honestly this was kind of nice to hear for a vent. I mean that experience probably was anything but pleasant and your wife maybe doesn't feel too good about her relationship with her parents, but other than that it sounds pretty positive with you two continuing your loving marriage and them straight up making fools of themselves. 
That boob line may be a bit harsh for anyone not deserving of it and I get the feeling of regretting not being able to hold your tongue but in that situation it kinda was a killer comeback. (And as you said it even took the wind out of her sails for a bit.)

Can only wish you two the best ‚ù§‚úå
So sorry you had to deal with this but it sounds like you both handled it amazingly well. Your MIL is a not a healthy human and, honestly, I just feel bad for her that she can be so corrupted and disconnected from reality. 

I was in a similar situation where my partner's parents were not kind. My recommendation is to support your partner as much as possible and keep communicating. This is likely a very hard time for them. 

I love your boob comment and good on you. With irrationality, sometimes dishing some creative language is the only way to defend yourself and stifle a dangerous situation. 

I'm sending you and your partner all the best, and please be safe!
Funny thing is i had this happen but with my own parents they drove 6 hours to my place while my wife was home and i was at work so when i got home they tried to get me to move back and talk to a pastor lmao
Please take care of yourselves. I can‚Äôt believe people still behave like this. It‚Äôs 2022 ffs üò¢ 

Why can‚Äôt people let other be who they want and live who they want. X
It‚Äôs really nice to see that your spouse continues to support you in the face of their family. That is an incredibly challenging thing for someone to do. Even when their family comprises of psychotic cunts.
As someone who cut their parents out of their lives 7 years ago I would advise your wife to do the same. You can love your parents with all their faults and also have zero relationship with them. It‚Äôs not worth either of your mental health to have to deal with people like that. Just because someone is family doesn‚Äôt give them the right to treat you poorly. It‚Äôs truly liberating once you do it and realize how much stress is reduced in your life. If family truly loved you they would disagree with your choices but at the same time respect them and not act like this. I hope both of you have a great life together.
How did you manage to not burst out laughing when they said not to get married?
That is unfortunately - there is an increase of fascism, racist and cynicism growing in out country - glad you still together and let us hope progressive thinking wins this what I see war
Holy woah. Those are some wild in laws. I‚Äôm so sorry that happened to you - but major kudos to you and your wife for taking it so well!
Also your MIL sounds totally batshit MY GOD üòÖ
It's these kinds of stories that make me terrified to come out, and have no idea how to get HRT and not be homeless. You are amazing to have been able to put up with that crazy bitch, and I hope you never have to experience this again
op that was the best clap back.
While there‚Äôs nothing wrong with the boob job, the comment was certainly well placed. Seems to have shaken up her own confidence a bit, and told her that this wasn‚Äôt going to be a situation where she‚Äôd just be able to say or do anything she wanted. Shifted the power to you. So I think it was a good thing to have said anyway.
This is obviously a horrible thing to deal with but my takeaways from this are all positive. You sound like you are happy in your journey of self discovery and your identity and relationship and you have great support from your wife. That is the most important and is inspiring to read and makes me happy. Second you stood your ground without getting too aggressive or physical. It sounds like the incident could‚Äôve gone way worse and you handled it great. So did your wife. Plus now you have all these pent up feelings getting a bit of release, they saw the real you and you don‚Äôt have to pretend any more. Also you seem to have cut ties with a toxic relationship for your wife and yourself. Just be sure your wife gets whatever support she needs cause it‚Äôs her family, but I‚Äôm confident you are already doing that. I hope you feel all the positives from this and take pride in your strength and your marriage and your future. A lot of times I read stories on here that make me worried or sad for the person and this just made me happy and inspired and optimistic for your future! I wish you and your wife all the best for your lives together though I don‚Äôt even think you really need any help, you seem to be doing great.
Sorry you had to go through this. On the bright side, your wife sounds awesome!
>""at least mine are real""

OP you are my new hero
Maybe I'm so used to managing other people's feelings but if I was in your shoes my first priority would be to make sure my wife is okay.

I am estranged from toxic family that gets explosive like this and it takes years and years to process the trauma. Their transphobia is in no way excusable and I think you did a fantastic job of showing that you won't be pushed around for their stupid ideals. 

Take care of yourself, then take care of your wife. She lost her parents today. Even if she felt like she lost them a long time ago, the day I made my estrangement official changed how I felt quite dramatically, even though I already wasn't talking to them or sharing anything. 

I'm glad you're okay and the MIL stopped when she did. Monsters.
And they call us dramatic üò≠
Is it really loading control when you planned to do it hours in advance?

I mean, it sounds like the FiL believed she wasn't gonna, but she knew she was gonna have a fit when she bought those plates.
Personally not bodyshaming is only for people, and bigots aren‚Äôt people
Love the ""atleast mine are real"" comment, best I've gotten to use is "" atleast mine are fresh and perky, untouched by the hands of dozens""
""Nice boob job"" I just love that special brand of misogyny cis women reserve for trans women.
Your wife is an absolute boss!!  Wow

Also unbelievable catty instincts üî•

The boob zing was sooooo solid
well. congrats on both of you for staying reasonably calm and mature in that situation, im glad neither of you were injured and that you dont rely on them for anything at all.

i hope your wife had a nice enough birthday despite that, and hope that she isnt too emotionally hurt by her family xx
Wooow. You're a hero, OP!
Honestly you should notify the police about this and get some kind of incident report just so you have a paper trail started in case she decides to do something even more unhinged.
Doesn‚Äôt sound like you lost control. Sounded like you honestly and clearly stated your boundaries.
Oh goodness sending hugs and astral projected tacos!  I am sorry you had to go through this
That‚Äôs awesome that you and your wife stick by each other like that. I don‚Äôt think I could have been this calm if someone insulted my fianc√©. We are both mtf, and I know my parents are very conservative, so I have not even told them about our relationship yet. Much love sis.
Yall handled it perfectly! 

I would get done house cameras. We have blink from Amazon after my brother went off the deep end. It‚Äôs reasonably affordable compared to what‚Äôs on the market and motion activated, hooked to WiFi and you use an app on your phone. 

Unfortunately there is no reasoning with these people and your safety (and your wife‚Äôs) is paramount.  It wouldn‚Äôt surprise me if she comes back and does property damage.
Amazing story. Good luck with the rest of your transition
I would also add that the one thing I hate about this which in fact may hurt your wife but does makes your decision easier is that your MIL is putting her moral values and judgments above her daughter, they are more important then her daughter. They never got to know you at all before they found out. And they just bring the hammer down on both of you with no attempt at trying to understand who you are and what you are doing. It's all very impersonal to you and it's all about her.
Good for both of you! You each stood up and didn‚Äôt tolerate what was being thrown your way! Now if I could do the same and stand my ground with my in laws‚Ä¶le sigh. I‚Äôm FtM and yeah‚Ä¶they don‚Äôt approve of it. I met my wife before I started transitioning too, took them awhile to get used to their daughter being with a woman! Anyway!

Proud of you! Keep it up and don‚Äôt take anyones crap! üß°
Holy fuck, that‚Äôs awful of them. Absolute Trash Bags‚Ñ¢Ô∏è, full stop. Kudos to you and your wife, the strength and perseverance you two have is a testament to real love. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüòé
I just wanna say congratulations on standing your ground. Screw that crazy lady.
Oh. My. God.

I absolutely lost it at your father in law saying *""You promised not to go crazy"".*
And this is exactly what I'd be afraid of my parents doing if they ever found out. We certainly can't choose our family, but you'd think our family would choose us over their ignorant bigotry. I'm sorry you had to go through that, but it seems like you and your wife are handling it just fine so far. üíú
Kinda sounds worth getting a restraining order against the people who might be physically dangerous to you. I wouldn't expect police to take action for a ""family member showing up to your house"" unless you can also say they're not allowed to by law. You could diffuse the threat by telling those people that the restraining order is just for your safety, and if they want to bridge the gap, you can talk about it over text.

It is better to be safe than sorry
So sorry you had to deal with that. 

Honestly it sounds like you handled it incredibly well. Props. Not sure I would be able to remain that calm and reasonable.
Wow!!  That woman is a serious nut job.  Credit to you for standing your ground and refusing to be bullied.
I'd look into an order of protection. This doesn't sound like it will de-escalate. Sounds like she's rallying the troops for round 2.
I was literally talking to my therapist about my birth family today, and how I would probably never be able to come out to them, as they attacked and still don't respect my ex, who came out as a trans man at the time. While I know for a fact that I would only be making things bad by telling them, it still hurts a little to think that I can't tell them and have supportive, loving, non-hateful family members to talk with, go shopping with and invite over to see thier new gorgeous (IMO) daughter and maybe help her find her new style.
did i miss the part where you ‚Äúlost control‚Äù? as far as you‚Äôve written you said a single thing to the MIL. you were as cool as a cucumber from what i read!
am so, so sorry you had to go through this nightmare. you are so incredibly resilient in the way you handled the situation, though! hoping for the best for you and your wife! üíú
Congrats on getting married! And honestly your clapbacks were great. ""At least mine are real"" is a banger.

On a scale from 1 to ""hackles raised,"" what's the likelihood of them following through on whatever threats your mil made in her meltdown? They sound like empty threats from a madwoman, but I want to be sure you two are proper safe.
Don't deploy pepper spray indoors, pro tip from a seasoned security guard, just taze them
Uhhhh i read some real threats of physical violence in there. If you're willing, able and can afford it... if it were me... id get a g*n and make a safety plan for who to call and where to go in case shit pops off
First co grats on coming out and I hope you have a good transition. Second atleast mine are real made me fucking laugh so hard
Fuck your parents. I laughed at ""Well at least mine are real"".
I mean your a woman soooo *swing her by the roots of her hair üòà*
I feel like these are the kind of people who actually need ‚Äúconversion therapy‚Äù and by that i really just mean a proper education on why all of those assumptions are baseless and misunderstandings of who trans people are.
Well they seem to be threatening your well being so I would consider making preparations to defend yourself. It almost sounds like she is threatening to like get her family to attack you. If you live in a place where you can get learn firearm safety and your right about defending yourself and get a gun. If you can't get a gun maybe a knife or really anything. Cause they do seem to want you hurt.
Honestly this is why I'm not that into the whole family thing. My brother is an ass and if he shows up at my house I'm calling the cops. 

So disappointing. I'm glad you guys were prepared but I'm still sorry you had to go through that.
Shoulda called the cops
Thank you for sharing, it was educational!
That's awful! I can't understand how some people can be like that. Props to you two for staying strong during it all and let Love win! Also props to your writing skills. This was surprisingly easy to imagine. Ever considered writing as a profession?
I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through that. Also I‚Äôm oddly pleasantly surprised the dad was basically there to manage the mom and didn‚Äôt say much?
Hugs to you both!
Good response, 10/10 meow. Making us proud OP.
Woah sounds like something straight from a horror movie! Sorry you had to deal with that!
I am littrally going through the exact same thing now apart they found out off other people and now I‚Äôm the worlds worst and my gf is making the worst decision of her life blah blah blah
Tbh while my parents are homophobic for the most part  cus some people in my family are gay and I myself is Trans but hiding it. If someone did this to me I'd be the person saying they need to leave or I get the sniper to take the shot. Kinda like a way to avoid being followed
Wow. I'm impressed with how you handled the whole thing. I would have probably lost it. Lots of love and happiness to the both of you
Time to file a restraining order against them.
Just to let you know I'm happy for you both. And don't let people like your wife's mom and dad Get you down.
My goodness what a read! You handled that better than I would of (I only just came to the conclusion I am Trans, lots of things to think about) but your wife is amazing too! She handled that so well. It is never easy when family are not open-minded. My father (if he was still in the picture) would have lashed out badly. I commend you both on how that was addressed and wish you both a happy future together. Your comeback to her was sublime and by all means justified.
>She said that her mind was broken

She was not wrong. But it wasn't broken for the reasons she implied.
Word of advice: call the cops early.

It takes a minute for then to get to you and if things go south it‚Äôs better for them to already be on their way.

Cops would much, MUCH, rather deal with cases where they can intervene early and prevent paperwork from needing to be filed than fallout after-the-fact.

Stay safe
I am so sorry you both went through this. I think if this is really what her parents are like she could consider going no contact. That was straight-up narcissistic rage.
Yup, this is the craziest shit I've heard in a hot minute. Damn, girl. I'm so sorry. I hope y'all are hanging in there üíï
I‚Äôm not sure what country/area you‚Äôre from, but if it‚Äôs the US, please consider getting a gun. 

This woman is clearly planning on hurting you herself or pushing another family to do it for her.

A police order and pepper spray won‚Äôt do much if somebody shows up armed at your home looking to harm you and your wife.
This is more or less my biggest fear about being out to my extended family‚Ä¶ I have a lunatic grandmother who has done things, including, but not limited to: kidnapping the bride at a wedding that she apposed, trying to get my parents to divorce (twice), and screaming at everyone in the household over me saying one swear word (damn) and leaving in a rush. I‚Äôm terrified that she would haul her ass up from the south just to try and stop me from being me.

I‚Äôm glad you made it out of this situation. I hope I don‚Äôt have to go through something similar.
Thank you for the kind words! Idk if this post will help anyone else, but it was nice to at least vent a bit. Moving forward, the best thing is we no longer have to hide who we are from anyone, and no more awful family gatherings! Last one I went to I lost like 5 pounds from anxiety induced nausea, which isn't something I've ever had before. I hope your wedding goes really well, and you get to wear whatever you want walking down the aisle!
Yeah, it probably does belong there, but I feel like this community might be able to relate to it as well. I don't think I've ever had someone hate me as vehemently as this woman does, so that's a new experience! We're locking our doors a lot more these days
Thanks for the award, btw! I don't think I've ever gotten one before, at least not one I know about, so that's pretty cool
Posting this to a non-trans sub will draw in the transphobes like vultures to a fresh carcass.
That is the harshest thing I've heard in a while but kinda deserved ngl.
Yeah, a psychiatrist said it sounds like she has some undiagnosed and untreated mental illness, but it's never good to diagnose second hand. Maybe this will cause her to get the help she needs, but probably not. That's her problem now, though!
I figure it'll be a few weeks/months before my heart rate stops skyrocketing every time there's someone walking past our house, but the relief from not having to deal with them will last forever!
Lol- kinda my thoughts as well, my wife had a point when she said that at least he was largely in control of his conduct and emotions, but I pointed out how low the bar is if being a slightly quieter bigot is all it takes to get praise.
My wife filed a police report yesterday, to basically do what you said and establish a record of her behavior. If something else does happen, hopefully that record will make any future legal actions easier. I don't plan on pursuing anything as long as she never comes back, but I'll still prepare!
My wife filed a report yesterday after we cooled off which was probably a good idea. I hope if/when you do end up having that conversation, they at least don't act violently!

One of my favorite parts of the conversation was when I described how the first time I met them, they were talking about how bs it was that the Confederate flag couldn't be flown above state capitol buildings, and her dad's response was that he didn't recall that event, but ""yeah, obviously we support it, we are conservatives"". I was like, yeah, so maybe you can see why we were hesitant to tell you guys at first?
One juicy bit I forgot to add, but you may appreciate. At one point, she gestured around us (to our house, flowers, plant stand, front yard, pride flag, etc) and asked, ""Does this look like happiness to you?"" My wife and I just laughed and were like, you mean living our lives in peace with friendly neighbors? Yeah, this definitely looks like happiness to us. She goes, ""well, it may look like that now, but give it time. Things can change!"" And I said, yes, HRT has been a lot of changes, and they've all been really positive! I've definitely become way happier, so I hope that change keeps on coming!
You're definitely right, it took some effort to not write a snarky text to her, but it's not worth stooping to her level.
That's the hope! Unfortunately that seems to be largely up to her, and she has nothing to do all day other than stew in her own anger, so idk what to expect. I know they own a gun, so I've got pepper spray strategically located throughout the house. Plus some fire extinguishers in case arson is afoot...
I was thinking this too, like how was mil able to text on the way home? Block block block
Oh, it was tough! Especially once I realized their main goal was to stop the wedding from happening, it just became so clear how impotent their rage was. Like, I couldn't help you if I wanted, it's too late. We already did the big gay
I agree, I am more shaken up by it than I thought I'd be, but it's definitely even more personal and tougher to process for my wife. It took my mom a while to come around, but her reaction was nothing like this, so I can only imagine how it feels when your own blood is saying things like that to you. We are helping each other as best we can, plus therapy, so I think we'll get through it!
I'm kinda wondering if I'll find some fresh paint on our house or cars. I'm pretty handy, so hopefully I can deal with any damage she tries to cause, but we did also set up a camera and we're locking the doors all the time now, and the dogs are on high alert!
Yeah, I've certainly considered it, but honestly idk if I can justify the cost at the moment. I did put pepper spray all over the house, plus our dogs are kinda scary, so I'm hoping that plus home field advantage will play in our favor. Plus she's got bad joints, so I think I've got her beat 100% if we take it to the ground
[deleted]
That was my wife's reaction as well, he definitely had some opinions of his own but managed to keep his cool. If he hadn't been there, I doubt she would have left so soon or so easily, so probably good that he was!
Wow, yeah, that's very intense! Honestly I just don't see where they get the energy to be so damn angry. Not caring is the easiest thing to do! I hope you don't have to deal with her, she sounds like a menace
You‚Äôre probably right tbh. I wouldn‚Äôt venture too far out of trans spaces with trans stories. Because there are a lot of people on Reddit who want to make our lives permanently miserable or worse.
Yeah unfortunately I've already seen that sub in particular side with bigoted parents of trans kids/adults and giving them all the unwarranted uwus of ""ooohh but it's a big change for them give them time,"" so I would definitely stear clear of posting this to other subs. Alas. It does have very r/justnomil vibes too tho lol. 

Anyways, proud of both you and your wife, OP. You did good.
If you don't have security cameras, now might be a good opportunity to install some and a setup to store footage so you can keep an eye on things both remotely and to have a paper trail in case the MIL escalates things or contacts some irrational male relatives to harass y'all.
NP, yinz earned that:)

Stay safe!
Too true! Can‚Äôt help people who don‚Äôt want to be helped.
Maybe some outdoor cameras would be a good measure? Then if they ever show back up again, just immediately call the cops. :( I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre in this hypervigilant state because of her craziness. That shit is the worst‚Ä¶
Yeah it really is a low bar. Though if nothing else, at least them each reacting in that way led to the conversation ending before it went further. Your FIL being quiet and perhaps a bit embarrassed probably saved you a lot of headache.

If they both flipped out things could get scary, and if they both tried to be quiet but condemning, you could be dealing with passive aggressive bs for weeks on end before it reached a boiling point.

Wish you guys luck and mad respect to your wife for standing up for herself, her decisions and for you. It's horrible what her parents are doing to her by making this an issue at all and it takes a good backbone to recognize it's them, not her, not you, in the wrong here.

Side note, I'd be super tempted to use the shards of those plates to make some cool artsy thing after painting them with trans colors just to spite your MIL. xP
Sounds like you handled everything the best way possible. Hopefully you‚Äôre done with that bs.

Thats incredibly scary jesus christ. Id suggest buying a gun if you think they are that serious about harming u lile thay

Did you get to rub that in their faces?!? Oh I wish you had recorded their faces if so!! 

I'm so sorry lovely that this is happening. But you and your wife sound awesome and wonderfully supportive of each other. üíú
I would get a couple more cameras. The proof will help should anything happen.  Please stay safe!
You could install dummy cameras and motion sensor lights, those are cheap and can be enough to make someone think twice. Maybe reinforce the doors with a second deadbolt

Yup. I‚Äôve seen a lot of users experience that. I knew my my home state and town‚Äôs subs would be a toxic cesspit. So I don‚Äôt even bother.

‚ÄúWith Pride and Determination.‚Äù	"Zooey Zephyr has now been officially silenced, for good. She has been silenced on party lines for one reason: she is trans. It is entirely undemocratic at best, and in reality its another step in the trans genocide. 
This may make you feel hopeless, and that would be fitting. However, do not let this shut you down. Zooey may be silenced, but you are not. Let them hear your rage. Show them your anger. Resist, ‚Äúwith pride and determination.‚Äù
We, as a community, cannot let this be. Make noise. Draw attention. Do everything in your power. We deserve representation, we are owed the right of speech, and the right to hold office. 
Please do not let this burn you out. Lets this add fuel to the fire. Let this make you angry. People of Montana harass your representatives in the state government. Do not let this stand. Do not stand down, stand up. Fight. For us all.

It's really past time that our community organize and mobilize in a similar way which Black Americans did during the Civil Rights movement.

I think one day humans will look back on this time with regret.  But for now it is up to us to survive and thrive in any way we can.
What do we learn from banning history, nothing. What do we get from forgetting history, nothing. The people with hate in their hearts will also get nothing. Learn from history don't forget it. These haters will lose, they know it. It's why they fight so hard for something that makes no sense. I will continue to pursue happiness how I see fit under the constitution of the United States. If that's with hormones well it's quite frankly no one's business...
If anybody here is able, willing, and in a reasonable position to get into politics professionally, now is certainly the time. We need more heroes like Zooey. ‚ù§Ô∏è
A little hopeful note: I'm pretty sure she's only silenced until next week. A new session starts after that.
This is fascism. Robert Reich just wrote about the root causes of this anti-trans ideology currently sweeping the Right. He makes very good points that this is part of a larger push by the Right to take over our institutions and enact authoritarian rule.

[https://robertreich.substack.com/p/whats-really-behind-republicans-mounting](https://robertreich.substack.com/p/whats-really-behind-republicans-mounting)

>As philosopher Jason Stanley notes in his How Fascism Works (2018):  
Men, already made anxious by a perceived loss of status resulting from increasing gender equality can easily be thrust into panic by demagoguery directed against sexual minorities‚Ä¶ . The fascist leader is analogous to the patriarchal father, the ‚ÄúCEO‚Äù of the traditional family‚Ä¶ . Attacking trans women, and representing the feared other as a threat to the manhood of the nation, are ways of placing the very idea of manhood at the center of political attention, gradually introducing fascist ideals of hierarchy and domination by physical power to the public sphere.
In this dark time, a little bit of light to ignite the battle cry within all of us. Zooey and the Tennessee 3 are hitting the news channels and getting national platforms to talk about this travesty. Every time they tread on us, they give us more of a platform. Let the fire ignite within us, let their fascism be their downfall. Let them show the world who they are. Don‚Äôt let them silence us.
This is what fascism looks like right here. The GOP is straight up going the fascism way with this, and they will get away with it because they always do. There will be more acts like this throughout the country, especially if Ronnie or Donnie get elected again. 

It is vitally important that the up and coming 18 year olds register and vote in 2024 to preserve democracy and restore it to what it was meant to be.
They can‚Äôt get rid of us forever!
A friend of mine pointed out that these horrid MAGAT legislators own businesses. That‚Äôs where we direct our ire. They hear only through their wallets.
Here is a link to petition to reverse this decision.

democracy is dead in the US. we are getting close to dictatorship
she isn‚Äôt silenced, she can still connect remotely.

#LetHerSpeak
she has not been silenced for good. she has been taught that she has been heard, like a clarion call .. 

she has learned her enemies.

she is not silenced. i expect her battle form to emerge ..
Signed, shared. Fuck em. I want a war against these unhinged pedophilic religious fuckwads.
Seems as though the only way towards change is for all of us who can, to start running for office
She wasn‚Äôt barred in the same way, unfortunately. They were removed completely, then voted back in. Zoey has been allowed to keep her job, but forced to work remotely and forbidden to talk. It‚Äôs a lot worse, because there is no existing mechanism for her constituents to get her back beyond protest.
I agree completely. Is it ok with you if I plug this link at the bottom of the original post, with credit to you? Your energy is exactly what we need and what I am attempting to incite.
I agree. I would love to have some kind of coalition of trans people. Our numbers aren't nearly as large as other communities, but we *need* to come together.
I want to. I‚Äôm in dc, I have all the background quals, but I‚Äôm utterly lost where to start.

Navy veteran, trans, Hispanic, worked at pentagon, now I work with diplomats. I just don‚Äôt know what the first step is‚Ä¶
I‚Äôd love to, but it‚Äôs not my path‚Ä¶yet. I‚Äôm a month away from moving to Paris for a giant promotion in my (largely) climate science work, but also to get away from shit like this.

When they killed Roe last year, I just knew we were next. I didn‚Äôt think it would be so fast, but I also didn‚Äôt (want to) think our support would be so soft on the left. :-/
It is until next year now from what I've heard.
There's an irony there about a man named Reich explaining how the GOP is fascist.
https://www.instagram.com/reel/Crius7ftsbz/?igshid=YmMyMTA2M2Y=
And we need to do whatever it takes to vote out every single one of those Republicans responsible for causing the rise of fascism in our nation. They absolutely don‚Äôt deserve to have any power or control in the legislature.
Agreed. I voted as soon as I could and encourage everyone to do the same. We cannot just accept that they will get away with this though, we must fight for justice until we are free.
They keep trying, but we keep coming back‚Ä¶ like every generation, in ever history, in every culture, since the Dawn of humanity, almost like we‚Äôre a part of the human existence‚Ä¶. Forever !
Thank you! I added it in the post
Awesome!
She can still vote remotely but she is not allowed to speak on any bills, so yes, she has effectively been silenced.
Debate is the heart of the legislative process in a representative democracy.  

She can vote but not speak to the chamber.
You came here to say this dumb shit 3 MINUTES after OP posted this. Amazing.
Hhahahaha, you are hella funny
If you think trump even deserves a place in this country you're wack. Especially as a trans/LGBT person.
When has reality or facts every stop the opposition? 

Fuck that. This is way close enough to be fired and removed. For us to protest and yell the same way that happened in Tennessee.
Does anyone know the reasoning for this being allowed? Like did they just enact some rule? Like why would it make sense to be able to silence someone but not remove them? 

Also what are the consequences for violating it and showing up and speaking? Then can she get removed and reinstated?

God, these people act like such children. Just deal with it head on and lose. Don‚Äôt kick the ball into the woods.
Yes please!

Let's get this moving.

As I said in the piece I am no expert on community organizing but we need to enlist those who are.
And trans allies to add to the numbers. If someone wishes to take down my gorgeous, smart, brave daughter, they will have to go through me first! A coalition is absolutely what we need.
Oops I was talking about the OTHER piece I posted today...

Start by contacting the city manager or which ever office handles voting in dc and ask for candidate qualification papers
https://democrats.org/run-for-office/

I can write, public speak, and am knowledgeable about the issues. I spoke with an org looking for dems who want to run, but I've been too nomadic and have too many skeletons in the closet for public office.

You might have better luck.
Hey I'm also in DC. Would love to chat with you
Well if you're fighting climate change I still consider you a hero :)
The legislative session ends in May pretty sure. Still bullshit.
LOL.
oh then yeah you‚Äôre right
I'm sad I'm an hour late and missed it. All I can see is the crater.
Oh, I agree that there should be protests, but I just mean that the two guys from Tennessee were reinstated *democratically*. That‚Äôs an easier process than protesting the unjust silencing of a trans legislator. This will be a longer fight, and we can‚Äôt fool ourselves into thinking that it will be as easy as that other situation.
The government only functions in legalities, by the definition of its existence. It doesn't mean this is good, and it should definitely be protested, but the lack of a clear mechanism to undo this is a valid concern. The seat is not vacant and her right to vote on legislation hasn't been revoked, so it's not apparent how to undo it. Such a thing would probably have to come from the same legislature that revoked her ability to speak on the floor, unlike in the case of the Tennessee men where it was their respective counties that appointed them back to their positions

The Montana legislative session ends in 2 weeks, anyways, and her expulsion expires on the same day. There's just not a whole lot to do other than yell very loudly and hope that changes the minds of Republicans, not people known for being receptive to such tactics
State legislatures make the rules for themselves.  

Only state supreme courts, or very rarely, federal courts, could force them to change, and honestly even that power only exists to the extent that the legislators agree to abide by it.  

How do could this be changed?  If people mobbed the floor every day they were in session.  Too many to arrest and jail, and prevented them from conducting business until they revoked her gag order.  I doubt she has that many supporters, especially montanans.  

I:m not saying it's hopeless, just understand the situation.
Will do‚Ä¶it seems so daunting but I feel so useless on the side
Definitely, I think starting a grassroots movement would be largely effective
‚ù§Ô∏è
May 5th is what I read, which probably means that fighting this will have little short time effect. Who knows what they'll do after that though
I notice the most random things at times ¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø
Something dumb about Trump being unfairly treated by this country. It didn‚Äôt make any sense.
This might already be the last phase of her protest anyway. Session ends soon. 

Realistically, she has said enough already and her vote won't be enough to sway any legislation from passing, only the fury she creates in her wake.

Her key goal was to raise hell and the national profile of how bad the bill(s) would be, and I think she achieved that.
Thank you!! I admire your courage!! Think I'm going to try running for my city council this year as well. Who knows if I'll succeed but even trying feels like it helps get visibility out there.
You can do it! Contact the Elections office in your area. Staff there will be helpful.
thank you!

Got deadnamed in front of all my coworkers by the new night manager. I was talked down to like a child and was treated like I was overreacting for being upset.	"So I work at Wal-Mart and I'm stealth FTM, I've been on testosterone for almost 2 years, I don't get misgendered and no one knows I'm trans and i prefer to keep it that way for safety reasons. Well, last night I went in to work and during roll call everyone got called leaving me unmentioned and my deadname that no one heard before. You can probably guess they'd put two and two together.
   I had a terrible panic attack, my managers know that is my dead name and my preferred name is on everything. This night manager knows my preferred name and insisted on repeating my deadname while I stayed completely silent and frozen. 
   I expressed my anger and why that was dangerous and wrong and he scolded me like a child saying ""how was I supposed to know?"" And playing it off and had the nerve to tell me ""hey, don't use that language with me okay?"" And when I was too upset to ask he repreated himself wanting a verbal ""Yes"" from me. 
   I don't want to go back to work, I feel absolutely humiliated.
   To make matters worse this guy knows I'm autistic and makes it his goal to trigger me. I have no one to go to and no one cares. 
   I'm done.

EDIT: I wanted to day thank you for all the advice. To be honest I fully expected this post to go unnoticed so I'm really surprised and thankful for the support. I'm going to just start looking for a new job to be honest. I'm not good with confrontation and I'm too emotionally exhausted with other factors to make a big stink about it.
Adding to that I'm homeless and can't exactly get a lawyer or anything to sue like some suggested. I think I'm just going to look for new employment, bide my time at walmart until I get the new job, and continue the good fight. Thank you"	"Ok if you have to keep the job, there‚Äôs a couple things you should do

1. Take notes. Diligently. Dates/shifts and exactly what happened and what your manager said
2. Go to a higher up, store manager, district manager, as high as you have to go. 
3. Be clear when you go to the higher up that this person is discriminating against you and that you will keep going higher up until someone takes action.
4. Request to never be placed on the same shift as this manager.
5. Look for a local civil rights group and get some Allies that can help you legally protect yourself

Sorry you‚Äôre going through this and I hope you can resolve this

Sending ‚ù§Ô∏è your way
Former Walmart employee here. Open door policy that shit immediately. There should be a number posted in the break room if you don't trust your gm. I'm so sorry that happened to you. What that manager did was unacceptable and they should be held accountable. Walmart, fortunately, has policies in place to help you in situations like this. Please use them. 
All the love ~ Zara
I also work at Walmart and you can open door that. A situation like that sucks and there is NO reason why a team lead or member of management should be treating you like that after their mistake. I've been working here for 3 years but have only been out for the last 6 months and I literally just had my store manager deadname me the day of our first Black Friday event and he didn't realize it immediately. Then about 5 minutes later he gave me a pat on the shoulder and apologized profusely for it. This goes for all members of management if they deadname me or get my pronouns wrong (doesn't happen often) they admit their mistake and we move on.
In this economy, finding a new job should be easy for him, so if there were any witnesses, I‚Äôd sue for discrimination if it‚Äôs persistent.
Never respond to someone who calls you by your deadname. Just completely ignore it, act like you have no idea who that is. Dont give in!
Listen, everyone else already gave you baller advice so I just want you to know your anger is 100% valid. We get gaslit all the time as trans men and women and when we get upset, we get made to feel like we‚Äôre the unreasonable ones. Absolutely forget that crap. I hope this manager gets in trouble for this and I hope you and your child do okay this winter. Love to you both üíñ
Fuck Walmart. Try to find a new job. Don‚Äôt even give them a notice.
r/antiwork might be a good place to go for legal advice if you want to take that route, but people in this thread are giving pretty good advice that i encourage you to take, especially taking notes up to someone that manages him. you do not deserve to be treated this way, im sorry that this happened to you
i‚Äôll really sorry this happened to you. wishing you gxdspeed as you power through the winter. i come from walmart country, lots of us have worked for that monster. do what you need to do and protect yourself at all costs üíù
Aww man, I can‚Äôt even imagine. As someone who is autistic also, I don‚Äôt even understand why ppl do stuff like that intentionally. So sorry you had to go through that.
I believe [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/qw4q8f/did_you_know_trans_people_have_workplace/) is a response to your post. Good tips and links.
When you find a new job, don't give a God damn two week notice
Document Everything that has happened so far, Then continue to document as things proceed.  Dates, Times and People involved (people present) are important. Report this to Human Resources.    Even if you are finding a new job it is best to get this incident on the books.  At the bare minimum if might prevent it from happening again (maybe even to someone else).  You might even be identifying a Transphobe that the company did not know was present.
Report him
Go straight to a lawyer,  do not pass go,  collect bucks!   That‚Äôs horrible‚Ä¶.so sorry it happened to you but you certainly have recourse.   Find a new job in the meantime,  you‚Äôre valid and deserve much better!
Wal-Mart. Why am I not surprised.
I‚Äôm a manager at Walmart.  I‚Äôve had problems with being misgendered from employees.  Call ethics if the store manager doesn‚Äôt take care of it.  It might take a while for them to do anything but ethics will take it seriously and take care of it.
What job does role call? Mine we just punch in and out. I know during school If I had a sub I‚Äôd tell them my preferred name, then what it says on the role call and that I‚Äôm here
Hell I'd contact HR if you have one.

And the other management.
Go to hr..
The deadname is horrible. I'm going to go at this from a different/additional angle though.

Being autistic and having this manager purposely trigger you is a real issue.  If you're in the US he is likely breaking laws around that. (In addition to being a total d-bag.) That issue needs to be brought up with HR and reported to the state.

He's creating a hostile work environment for multiple groups of people. I'm certain if that comes to light he'll be spending time with an HR rep of he isn't outright fired for putting the store and company at risk.
Yea, Walmart and Amazon are two corporations to stay away from. Unhappy bitter people take command and don't care about human rights. To then you're a pawn that's replaceable.
You can reach out the ACLU for assistance with legal action.
wdym safety reasons?
Lmk if you think I should take him on a nice trip üëç
OP, Ik you said you don't have the money (Or energy) to get into a full-on war over this but most of the time, even the threat of legal action gets people moving.  
""Do I need to contact higher ups about discrimination in the work place?"" or the like since NOBODY wants their job threatened unless they REALLY dislike their job.
Report this to HR or your personnel staffer (who is technically above even the store manager though only for oversight purposes). As a former ‚ÄúCoach‚Äù (ASM) this is completely unacceptable behavior and constitutes harassment. Especially if they aren‚Äôt showing respect after you explained to them why that isn‚Äôt what you want to be called! If I was working there I would have recommended we put them on leave for a day to retake personnel management training cbls. This is a bad look for the store and company and just an overall shitty thing for a ‚Äúleader‚Äù and ‚Äúrole model‚Äù to do. Sorry this happened to you :(
I work at walmart and can assure you that you need to report this to ethics. Im kinda stealth rn as well and get alot of flak but if they do this intentionally you need to report it to your store manager or lead and if the issue persists then call ethics and open door them. Walmart might be a shitty place to work especially overnights but for a manager to do this is considered transphobia and is against the companies policy. 

In short, report them and make it known that he is aware of what he is doing; as management is supposed to be trained on dealing with people like us including names and actions. 

If your store is aware of your condition regarding autism i also highly recommend you report them for abuse with a social worker or other third party as it will help stop this abuse and you might compensated for workplace abuse.
""Negligent infliction of emotional distress"" (NEID) is a personal injury law concept that arises when one person (the defendant) acts so carelessly that he or she must compensate the injured person (the plaintiff) for resulting mental or emotional injury. 

Talk to an attorney about this. One might be able to take you on contingency (pay nothing unless you win.) side note: this is not legal advice
I'd say you got it bent. I get it. That shit hurts, no doubt.what though. You ain't never been hurt before are humiliated.? What I thought. Take your butt right back in to that store and work just as hard as you always do and tell that asshole good morning and good night every day. BUT...... From now on you carry a small little recorder and every time some one treats you bad record that ass and post it rvru3here you can think to do so. Bet hisq don't know he or she act like that.  Make them 2ant to hide. You Rick and that it from me...Peace..out
Im so sorry man, you didn't deserve that. Sending love üíó
Get somebody pro Bono. There's so many people that want to help others that would take an easy case like this.
I'm so sorry this happened. He's an ass and you were well within your rights to be upset with him.
sorry that happened to you.  Sure sounds like there was an element of intention to dehumanize you.  Good luck to you, don't give up.  You matter.
This post feels like it could fit into the antiwork sub, not saying you should post there. But it definitely has the same vibe as other stories where the managers are completely disrespectful and lack any kind of compassion. I wouldn't doubt transphobia could play a role but these kinds of bosses also love making anyone that works for the feel small and miserable and sometimes it feels like they don't even need a reason.
I‚Äôd try brink in a wire that records sound and record things he says and does and also you can report to the police on harassment if he‚Äôs triggering autism on purpose and if possible show them security footage if it has sound even better
That‚Äôs so fucked. I‚Äôm so sorry you had to deal with that. I would totally go to HR about that. If you have it set up that your preferred name is on everything and they still purposely called out your dead name that‚Äôs definitely worth going to HR.
Complain to hr if there is one, idk if Walmart does. If your real name is on everything then he would have had no reason to deadname you than to piss you off. I would also suggest to just not respond to your deadname no matter how much he insists on using it. He‚Äôll cave in eventually. It only depends on who has more determination and you definitely have him beat there no doubt.
Also, if I Canada, note that this sort of thing was recently ruled a human rights violation. Manager could absolutely have the book thrown at him if you can document a recurring issue with this.
Awesome advice. I just want to piggy back and say do these things even if you don't want/need the job anymore. Especially taking notes. Also, journal it out, for your own mental sanity too. <3
Yep! It‚Äôs a really similar approach to union worker stuff. Be diligent, write things down, and make sure that you don‚Äôt let shit slide.
Totally agreed, and also former employee here.  I had a situation that I reported on the hotline and it was dealt with within several days.  Corporate HR doesn't seem to leave a lot of wiggle room for harassment reported through open door.
That‚Äôs reassuring to hear ‚Äòcause I work at Walmart, but I‚Äôm as closeted as I can be for the next ~30 days, then I‚Äôm starting hormones. Good to know that the managers will have my back, at least
I'm homeless living with my friends until winter is over and then I have to find my own place. I'm also a single parent with no car, so I have to he able to support my daughter and afford to go to and from work with uber. I pay my phone bill and rent every month. I have no choice. Jobs are hard to come by and I can't risk losing this one.
No don't fuck Walmart. You sue that ass for hostile work environment. And did you know that Walmart has stores all over the world. Go see some places on their dime ....uuuummmm. Transfer anyone
And if that doesn‚Äôt work go into gay and lesbian bars and write his phone number and name on all the bathroom stalls in marker .
Each of us had our name called and was assigned a department
I work with folk who are homophobic/transphobic
Please don‚Äôt work hard when selling your labor for an hourly wage. You get paid the same either way, and it just increases expectations for the entire workforce and makes for an unhealthy work environment where people who work at a casual pace are belittled and judged. Even if you‚Äôre working hard they are still going to pay you the least that they possibly can. Working hard in retail doesn‚Äôt improve your potential earnings or career path it just makes you a sucker, and increases your and everyone else‚Äôs workload for absolutely no benefit to the workers.
Oh man that's a dangerous mix. Recording abuse on the sly can be hella illegal depending on where you are. Also working harder or even as hard isn't always possible when anxiety is in the mix. When you are struggling to just function just going back into that environment is a test of strength in itself.
No they don't. Corporate hr takes all open door policy reports very seriously. Rightfully so too, it's what keeps them from getting sued a lot. Better to fire a hateful person than pay out a discrimination settlement. Corporate will 100% be on OP's side.
Yeah, I hear in certain places some managers will be assholes anyway but you can always open door it. Company policy ALWAYS has your side in a situation like that.
Find a new job before you quit this one, for sure. Finding a job within walking distance of home might be difficult so you do whatever you gotta do to be safe with you and your kid.
[Another person posted this on the thread and just wanted to make sure you see. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/qvxyll/got_deadnamed_in_front_of_all_my_coworkers_by_the/hkzar70/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf&context=3)
Sue? Lmao how much is a lawyer again‚Ä¶?
I mean I wouldt say it makes you a sucker but there isn't really any reason to work ""hard"" in retail or fast food. Go to work, do the minimum and get your money, because they will always find a reason to not give you a raise. And now that places are desperate to hire, the bar for the minimum is lowered even more. I honestly don't blame anyone who buys into the ""you can pull yourself up by your bootstraps, and start at the bottom and go up to the top"" mantra because it's repeated so often in our culture
For things like human rights violations or civil lawsuits you can usually get a lawyer for free initially so long as you have a winnable case. Then they just take a percentage of the payout once a judgement has been placed. It‚Äôs still kinda scummy as they usually take a substantial percentage of the payout, but that‚Äôs capitalism.
Attorney for this would be free, if they take the case... for a cut of the settlement.
Good to know, thanks! /genuine
Alternative there are also lawyers that operate pro bono.
Of course! Always glad to share some unsourced information from the back of my brain. üôÇ

Please can someone help me formulate a reply to this?? I can't see past my anger. My daughter is 12 and has been out and happy for 18mths. She has no dysmorphia over her genitals and hasn't decided if she wants the op yet. Can someone in my daughter's position please help me formulate a reply?		"Tbh, they don‚Äôt seem like a friend at all. No real friend would be this disrespectful about someone else‚Äôs child. They clearly need to educate themselves because yikes, what they‚Äôve said is so ignorant.
I'm so sorry that this person pretends to be your friend. If that where about me or my child I would simply reply that you are entitled to your wrong opinion and then block them right away and cut them out of and my and my child's life.
Strongly consider not speaking to or associating with this person anymore. No 12 year old needs that in her life, I hope she doesn't have to interact with that very transphobic person.

Whatever you do or say, good luck üòäüíú
I think you should politely but firmly tell her that your daughter is none of her business. Why on earth does she think she can bring up a 12 year old's genitals on social media? That in itself is completely out of line. 

Also you can get change the narrative. Hit her with some links like the [Mayo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/healthy-lifestyle/childrens-health/in-depth/children-and-gender-identity/art-20266811#:~:text=Most%20children%20typically%20develop%20the,gender%20by%20age%203%20years.) Clinic saying kids understand their gender by 3. Her comments made it clear she has no idea what the transition process is. 

This lady is deranged and needs to be blocked from all your social media. Toxic people like that aren't worth your or your daughters energy.
I wanna say that that she was never a typical boy and that she might not have the op but not having it doesn't make her any less of girl , that the op would only be in many years to come anyway and so fucking what if she decides she wants to de-transition anyway.... My job is to love and support her.
Can someone give me views on how it feels to be a young person who is born in the wrong body, and what it means to be supported during the transition? 
My daughter can't express how she feels to me cuz she isn't great with words.
 The only thing she ever says is that she's much happier being a girl, but I feel this isn't going to be enough to shut my friend up.
""no purpose other than to serve another man"" wow. What a mysoginyst creep
For starters I am 50yo MTF and transitioning for two and a half years. Half of my life has been waisted in someone else‚Äôs body. I have dealt with depression and self medication and never was allowed to even think I had a feminine side. You see I told my parents when I was five that this was all wrong I needed to be a girl. I wanted to be a girl. It was cute for a while as they brushed it off. Until I was about 9 years old then it was diets it was camps and beatings and punishment until I left the girlie things go. But as you can tell here I am 50 years later trying to be myself again. I can‚Äôt believe that any parent would sentence their child to a life time of pain, denial, lies, and embarrassment. Through those 50 years I have had to act the male role. Coming out to my first wife ended in divorce. I am so scared and scarred that I fear coming out to my wife now. I appreciate what you are doing for your daughter. She will too. I wish I had parents who truly loved and wanted the best for me not just their image of who they want me to be. Your daughter is a beautiful perfect person that just needs some help for everyone else to see what she sees. Some may include surgery and that decision doesn‚Äôt need to be made now. It‚Äôs not easy. And there are no easy options. But I am sure you will find the right words and do the right things to make her life the happiest it can be. You got this momma bear.
As a young trans woman I'd say don't hold back at all, let them know how wrong they are because people like us don't get strong support all the time so the more confident you are in your support of your daughter the more she will probably grow in confidence her selfüòä, hope this helps(also tell your daughter I hope she is a very happy woman üòä)
Well I‚Äôd start with ‚Äònever talk about my child‚Äôs genitals again, that is so far beyond inappropriate and completely unacceptable and you are now blocked‚Äô because transphobia aside WTactualF. 

Honestly I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôd bother with anything else.
I am a trans biologist keeping up with relevant literature in my free time and toying with the idea of putting together a literature review for publication. I have a few summaries of relevant papers that I‚Äôve compiled from my cursory review. I‚Äôve posted this elsewhere, but maybe it will be if use to you (though unfortunately I do not yet have links to the articles stored on my phone and I use Reddit exclusively through mobile, so looking further into these papers will require a bit of googling. My apologies‚Äî I‚Äôm working on it):

Suicide rates dropped from 29.3 percent to 5.1 percent when there was access to transition-related treatment. (De Cuypere, et al., 2006)

A meta-analysis of transgender people who transitioned medically demonstrated that the average reduction in suicidality went from 30% pre-treatment to 8% post-treatment, and that 78 percent of transgender people had improved psychological functioning after treatment. (Murad, et al., 2010)

‚ÄúThese findings suggest that clinical management including puberty suppression, enabled these formerly gender dysphoric adolescents to make important age appropriate developmental transitions, contributing to a satisfactory quality of life.‚Äù (de Vries, 2010)

86% of patients who accessed transition were assessed by clinicians at follow-up as stable or improved in global functioning. (Johansson, et al., 2010)

In a cross-sectional study of 141 transgender patients who accessed medical transition, suicide fell from 19 percent to zero percent in transgender men and from 24 percent to 6 percent in transgender women. (Kuiper, Cohen-Kettenis, 1988)

‚ÄúAlthough more evidence would be welcome, adequately treated gender dysphoria is likely to be safer than the untreated condition, which is associated with an enhanced risk of depression and suicide. Reassuringly, few transsexuals regret undergoing treatment.‚Äù (Levy, et al., 2003)

‚ÄúSecond to social support, persons who endorsed having had some form of gender affirmative surgery were significantly more likely to present with lower symptoms of depression.‚Äù (Boza, et al., 2014)

‚ÄúStudies show that there is less than 1% of regrets, and a little more than 1% of suicides among operated subjects. The empirical research does not confirm the opinion that suicide is strongly associated with surgical transformation.‚Äù (Michel, et al., 2002)
I agree with those that said don‚Äôt bother, just cut this person out. If you have to have the last word keep it short and don‚Äôt waste too much effort because nothing you say will change this person‚Äôs mind. Their comments are misogynistic in addition to being transphobic and they‚Äôre comfortable enough in their bigotry to try to tell you how to raise your daughter. I understand wanting to have the last word, I‚Äôm the same way, but a lot of the time it‚Äôs not worth engaging unfortunately.
Block them. Cut them out of your life . They aren't worth the anger. If that isn't an option then just stop replying.
""You are a horrible and toxic person. Goodbye. "" and then click block.
Also op you are a parent many of us would be so jealous to have. A lot of us had awful parents who forced us to not be out then
Tell him he‚Äôs mad fucking weird for talking about a 12 year olds genitals ‚Äúservicing men‚Äù.
The correct term is dysphoria, not dysmorphia, but regarding that person, make an example of them and how their transphobic will not be tolerated towards your daughter. You are being the mother she needs, and obviously not doing anything wrong by letting het be herself.
That exactly why I uninstalled Facebook
The block button seems like a good response.  Wow! Awful.
Just msg you're going through a tunnel and the service is abysmal

Or something like transphobic says what? 

Gets them every time :) 

don't waste your time and energy on such a pathetic interaction go have a hot cup of cocoa nd snuggle with your daughter <3
Sadly you can't argue with a transphobe. They don't care 1 bit about anything. They're just full of hate.

Easiest thing is block and move on.
Saying your kid has a ""right"" to somthing, but then making it compulsory is all you need to know. Smh
She is not even a friend in real live. Your daughter is your daughter in real live. Don‚Äôt waste time writing to that person anymore. Don‚Äôt feed the troll. Write to your daughter and tell her you love her!
Oh, lots of responses come to mind:

* ""Do you know that my child's life and choices are none of your business?""
* ""Are you always this fixated on twelve year old children's genitals?""
* ""Perhaps you should spend some time thinking about the differences between rights and obligations.""
* ""Sorry, you must have me confused with someone else. I don't have a son.""
* ""Matt. 7:1-3""
* ""May God grant me the self-assured confidence of a mediocre, ill-informed white man""
* ""üñï""
Personally, I would reply with the following and then block them. No point in letting them continue to spew hatred to you. They seem unwilling to change.

""I'm sorry that your reality is so limited. I love my daughter for who they are, not the flesh that sits atop their bones. My daughter has a right to be a woman. A right to choose who she loves. A right to be happy as herself as you are with yourself. Seeing her happy fulfills me as a parent and these last 18 months I have watched proudly as she has taken steps few people are strong enough to take to fight for her own happiness. This is my daughter. This is her reality.

If I actually believed you would listen, I could tell you all the hundreds of ways I see this already healing my daughter. I could tell you the science that says she natural and justified. I could point to the millions of transitioned people whose only regret was not doing so earlier. My daughter is fortunate enough to realize and strong enough to say who she is. It is now my job as a parent and as a compassionate member of society to fight for her right to reach her maximum potential. This is my daughter. This is my reality.

I again am sorry that your reality is so limited. I wish you could see how beautiful the world becomes when you simply open your heart and mind. Unfortunately, the only thing you've proved to me is your unwillingness to grow. And so while my daughter blossoms from her seed, you will sit still among the dirt until you rot away, giving energy to the seeds that come after you. This is my daughter. This is our reality.""
""I still don't have a son.""

And block her.
Tell them their obsession with your child's genitals is alarming and they should seek therapy. Then block them.
Your daughter is 12 YEARS OLD, WHY IS AN ADULT EVEN THINKING ABOUT HER GENITALS? What the fuck
This person is not your friend and does not deserve to be in your life. Don't waste time on anger, hard as that may be.
First off my daughter hasn‚Äôt decided on surgery yet she is x yrs, so I‚Äôd kindly appreciate it if you would stop thinking about her genitalia plz,

I‚Äôm also a paranoid reclusive so I don‚Äôt often deal with ppl,

gl and much luv
""Cringe+ratio+L+transphobe+bigot""
There is absolutely nothing that you or anyone on this forum can say that will make any difference to them. There are piles and piles of evidence that prove you and your daughter right, and it will all go in one ear and out the other. Only thing I can suggest, is to cut this toxicity out of your life. It will only hurt you and your daughter. It's not worth the headache.
Who is this person?
They don‚Äôt sound safe. They are misinformed. 
Keep loving your daughter!!
You're being an amazing parent by supporting and protecting her. It makes me happy to see
Ask them why they're so interested in the genitals of a 12 year old
This guy is gross talking about your daughter's privates like that. Don't talk to this guy.
Logic and reason doesn't work in situations like this. They may change their mind sometime in the future, but nothing you say here will effect immediate change - even providing them with facts that show how this kind of thinking is detrimental to the actual lives of trans kids, or any facts at all, since they have an emotional, irrational, or ideological belief (you cannot reason someone out of a belief they were not reasoned into).

So, I tend to be direct about how gross and hateful their behavior is, and how little they are acting. It may sound a little harsh, but it let's them taste their own medicine with the slight difference of rejecting their behavior and not the essence of who they are as an individual. If it takes, then maybe they'll have their first hit of empathy that could possibly build over time.

With that said, my response would be something like:

""You are acting very hateful, and I don't want to be around people like you. Your comments make me feel icky. I hope you can find empathy for others who are different from you sometime in the future, and not rely on tearing down others to gain self importance. Until then, I no longer want you as even the smallest, most insignificant character in the narratives of my, or my daughter's, life narratives.""

I would then immediately block and ignore all attempts to communicate with this person unless they open with ""I'm sorry"".  Until they can grow as an individual, I would not let them have my attention to share their hate. But, that's just my approach.
I will forcefully fill that women‚Äôs home with pride flags until she cries rainbows
The reply is unfriend and block. I know it can feel cathartic to get the final word but‚Ä¶ if my parents taught me anything it‚Äôs that ‚Äúbeing the bigger person‚Äù means feeling like you lost a lot of arguments when simply walking away actually means winning.
Just block the fucker. No sense arguing with a bigot like that.
1 - please never talk to that person again & keep them as far from your daughter's life as possible, for her sake as much as for your own.

2 - as for a reply: 
""The fact you're more concerned with a 12 year old's genitals than with her happiness is disgusting. Reducing trans people to sexual organs is cruel, but the fact you're reducing a child to her genitals is just sickening. She is 12. My daughter is happy, and comfortable in her own skin, and frankly my love for her goes beyond expectations for the dynamic she'll take in a relationship when she is older. I'm more concerned with making sure she knows she is loved unconditionally. As far as we're concerned, her body is her own, and she can do whatever she likes to it in order to continue feeling comfortable in it. What that entails or doesn't entail is none of your business, nor is it anyone else's business unless she is consensually choosing to be involved with them. Which as a 12 year old, she is not choosing to do so yet. 
I valued your friendship, but if you're going to look at or talk to my daughter and only be able to think of her in a sexualised manner, then I don't want you in either of our lives. I strongly suggest you reevaluate how you see people, and if you base everyone's  worth based on your sexual expectations of them and believe it's your place to get involved to somehow ensure they meet those expectations, then I would suggest you reconsider that stance. Goodbye.""
Delete them and block them. It's as simple as that. They don't give you and your daughter the respect everyone deserves, you owe them absolute nothing for a response. 

Feeling angry over someone who is too closed minded to let others live their lives is someone you will never be able to convince to see different. Holding this anger over someone like this is not beneficial at all for you or your daughter.

Also OP, you're an amazing mother for being so loving and supportive. Stay strong and set the example for her, as she will inevitably face adversity in her life and won't ever rise above it if she stops and gets angry every time someone is being ignorant. ‚ù§üíô
no matter what this person says, stand your ground. there will be people out there who will say dumb things like that but don‚Äôt let them change your mind about your daughter
Personally I wouldn‚Äôt even grace them with a reply. Some people are blinded by their hatred, it‚Äôs often not worth getting through to them. I have to remind myself ‚ÄúThink: Would I actually WANT this person to be on my side, if they‚Äôre so set in their ways and easily believing?‚Äù
Cut this person out of your life like the cancer they are.

If you‚Äôd like ideas, you could start with the fact that this person is part of the reason the UK is increasingly seen as an international embarrassment for being known as TERF Island.
just say something along the lines of her insecurities are really showing and that a therapist could help with that and her bigotry
Do sleep on it before responding....then make it epic and done!  Hugz, you've got this.    
ü•∞ü•∞  Lilli~
Ask them 

why the fuck are they focused on your TWELVE YEAR OLD daughter‚Äôs Genitals. Like what are they? Some sorta pedo? 

‚ÄòCause ew. She is 12! What is in her pants is non of their business. ü•¥
I would just stop the conversation and not talk to them. You won‚Äôt change someones mind who doesn‚Äôt want their mind changed.
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs none of your business, leave me alone‚Äù
Get the (please excuse the language used here) hell away from them revoke them of the privilege of being around you and your life make them seem like they have entirely disappeared (what would be better would be to actually make them dissapear (don't tell anyone I said that) ) and get an entire council to make them away from you
""Why the fuck are you thinking about my twelve-year-old daughters genitals?""
Politely tell them to screw off and block the number. Not worth the headache. These type of people have no desire to learn or change their crap behavior.
You take every legal action possible to keep them away from your daughter and family.
I‚Äôd simply reply with a healthy helping of f*ck you üñï
Block him or ask him why he‚Äôs so obsessed with your daughters genitals. That might shut him up a bit. Last message sounded creepy af
Response or not, your daughter is lucky to have you.
Use one of the most famous transphobic arguments against them: ‚ÄúWhy would I speak about genitals with my 12 years old daughter?‚Äù
OP, you're not gonna convince this bigot. I promise.
This isn't something you reply to. This is someone you block and cut all contact with, and then name and shame on social media, emphasizing that this adult was messaging you about a 12 year old's genitals.

fwiw a neovagina isn't plastic, it's your own tissue. transphobes are fucking stupid part 302987
I personally wouldn‚Äôt dignify it with a response and just cut this person out completely. Block them and move on. If this is what they think you don‚Äôt need that negativity in your life or your daughters life.
I wouldn't even respond, just block them. Nothing you say will matter to them. And if you want to respond simply for your benefit, you'll have to write how you feel. I would end the response withbsomething about not wanting them in your life and then block them as soon as you responded, don't let them respond.
If it were me I'd just block them. It's hard to talk to people who have their head so far up their ass.
Don't reply. Simply block and ignore
Block them. Not worth your time.
Delete. Block.
They're a transphobic cunt, get them out of your life.

This trans YouTuber went undercover in the kinda of groups that your Facebook friends here likely is a part of. They uncover and debunk the violent propaganda that the group pushes and demonstrate how the rhetoric can lead to the deaths of trans youth. But most critically they expose that gender critical ideology is built on a cult logic. Actual. Explicit. Cult logic.
i think the correct thing to say is cry harder you piece of shit
""Keep talking about a twelve-year-old child's genitals, and I'll be having a word with the FBI, pedophile.""

Blunt and simple. When we're trans, we're no longer human, and all decency goes out the window to them.
You could either block them across all social media and forget they exist, or reply with ""Your opinion is worthless"" THEN block them across all social media and forget the exist. They're disgusting and you shouldn't bother with people like that. 

On the first whiff of bigotry, BLOCK.
Yeet that person out your life with the might of Zeus!
I am not you, so I‚Äôd have a very different response to this than I think you might.  I also don‚Äôt know your relationship with this person,  But here is how I would respond.

Phase 1: try to handle it alone

I‚Äôd tell that person to either stop pressing the issue or get out of my life.  I‚Äôd tell them they didn‚Äôt understand what they were talking about or what they were doing.  I would tell them this is my daughter, that I love and support her for who she is, and that I will protect her right to be herself with every fiber of my being.  If the person persisted I would tell them I couldn‚Äôt talk to them again until the respected my daughter‚Äôs gender, I would screen cap everything said I‚Äôm case this person started spreading lies later, and I would block them for my own sanity.

If this were sufficient to avoid this person and I didn‚Äôt care about their relationship, I‚Äôd avoid them and leave it there.  If they were in a position to harass me or my daughter, I‚Äôd go in ti phase 2.

Phase 2: group effort

If we had any mutual friends who I knew were supportive of my daughter,I‚Äôd go to them for help handling this.  I‚Äôd show them the screen caps if they didn‚Äôt understand.  This would serve two purposes.  Purpose one would be that maybe my friends, who are perhaps more emotionally detached, might be able to figure out a better solution.  If not though, this would also help protect me from being kicked out of the mutual friends circle I shared with the transphobe because other people would now know what is going on and have heard my side of it before it got misrepresented as me being unreasonable.  I would not ask any friends to cut off their association with the trabsphobe, but I would inform them that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable being in the same space as them until they gendered my daughter correctly, and would not allow then around my daughter.

Phase 3: self defense if necessary

If this did not yield a stable solution and the other person escalated by attacking my interpersonal relationships, I would do everything in my power to cut them out of my life completely, and would in every situation possible ensure they did not have a position of power over my daughter and I.  This kind of conflict can easily turn into a fight over who gets to keep the friend group, hence the screen caps and the set up in the previous phase to make sure the friend group was prepared for this situation.  I would in all cases try to maintain the moral high ground by sticking to honest tactics.

But like, that‚Äôs me.  I am trans and cannot tolerate this stuff emotionally.  I‚Äôve also been blackmailed over being trans by an anonymous person in my friends circle, so if I‚Äôm seeming a little excessive here that‚Äôs where I am coming from.  People like this can be dangerous, and need to be treated as dangerous.
delete facebook
In all honesty... I think the best response is to reply with a simple ""i disagree and would appreciate it if you never speak to me or my daughter again"" and then follow it up with just blocking them on all socials. They just want to pick a fight with you and it's best if you just do not give them the satisfaction.
Block and ignore. Not worth your time.
Block and move on, nothing else
Block that person and move on, you and your daughter don‚Äôt deserve that shit
I wouldn‚Äôt justify this with a response, this stranger is not entitled to information about your daughter‚Äôs transition journey. It‚Äôs clear this person does not support you or your daughter and the only thing they should get is a block
Same old same old. Doesn't aknowledge that the daughter made the choice to try to feel more comfortable in her body and completely ignores any scientific research on the topic. They don't deserve a place in your life, don't give it to them.
""it makes me sick that the only thing you want to talk to me about is my daughter's genatalia.  Which is, quite frankly, none of your business.""
Block, maybe cry a little. Works for me?
The obsession with your daughter‚Äôs genitals is pretty disturbing ngl. Sadly you probably won‚Äôt be changing the mind of someone like this, say whatever you want and then block them. Your daughter is lucky to have such a supportive parent willing to defend them, though!
You can tell based off the initial comment there is no changing this persons mind, block, forget about and move on. Don‚Äôt give them the time of day by justifying them with a reply.
I would say my daughter has the right to live her life, make her own choices, and fulfil her own destiny, as all women should be allowed in this life. I'm certainly not going to stop her. I never thought I'd have to tell my friend to stay in their lane when it came to my children and how they choose to live their lives. I'll save you the hassle of cutting me out - you're blocked. If you're wondering whether it's more important to me to make you comfortable with your outmoded ideas of gender or support my own child, let mama bear clear that up for you - I 1000% choose my daughter. Every. Time. You're a dinosaur and you and your opinions will be left, comfortably, in the past. You might convince yourself in your ignorance that you're helping me, you're not. Educate yourself, learn something and take a long hard look at how you just behaved today. Think about how you can do better and don't bother me or my family until you get some damn manners you rude cow.

And block the shit out of them.
Don't bother with a reply, nothing good will come out of it. You have a daughter you love and she loves you too, nothing else matters. Spend the energy somewhere happy üòä
You could point out that it's rather creepy and disgusting to be reducing an underage child to their genitals by stating a future she knows nothing about? Vaginas reconstructed or not weren't meant to ""satisfy male genitals."" A woman (trans or not) can be and is more than that. And the fact she even written it, let alone that part is gross and a little disturbing.
You were asking for things like replies, so you could say like: 
I will talk to my DAUGHTER and tell HER to never associate with the likes of you. You are transphobic and do not belong in my life. Do not contact me again and F off or something like that
Idk if they'd listen but I'd say something like ""I'd rather have a happy and healthy daughter that has autonomy over her own body than a dead ""son"" because we refused to let her be herself.
Tell parasocal Betty that Just because she's seen a few of your Facebook post doesn't mean she knows you personal what's good for you or your DAUGHTER. 


Tell her to focus on her own Boring life then trying to live in a fantasies of being apart of yours
I would say ‚Äúthe science says trans people are real, and conversion therapy has always proven to harm trans people. Why would I want to be my daughter‚Äôs own bully, and risk her dying because I had to listen to some uneducated jackass with their brain stuck in the Medieval Ages?‚Äù
Why are they talking about your daughters genitals and sex life? THATS fucking weird- would mention that in your reply and then block block block
[deleted]
Tell them to go fuck themselves, then block them.
You and your daughter don't need that energy, just move on and focus on being happy.
I'm mad envious of your daughter, I wish I had the courage to accept myself at that age ‚ù§Ô∏è She's a warrior
I am blinded by anger just after reading this and can‚Äôt offer good advice because I‚Äôd lose my absolute FUCKING mind on this person but id just like to say, you‚Äôre an amazing parent, thank you for accepting your daughter for who she is and advocating for her.

This trash bag saying this shit should go play in some traffic.
Already the fact that this person is doing such a god awful scene in PUBLIC on Facebook is enough for you to throw them out of your life, what a shame.. btw you rock for taking care of your daughter that way !
Hoo boy that‚Äôs a lot to unpack. Actually, nah, not gonna bother.

‚ÄúAnon, please, my daughter is better than you. Sure, your genitals may just be a dude‚Äôs fuckhole in your eyes but my daughter was raised to have some self-respect.‚Äù
She‚Äôs 12‚Ä¶why are the transphobes always so focused on genitals? Especially childrens? Honestly thag would be my response.

‚ÄúWhy are you so focused on my daughters genitals? She‚Äôs 12 you fucking pedo.‚Äù

Then block that person. Seriously not worth your time.
Your ""friend"" is sexualizing children. Gotta love them telling us we do the same. Your anger is justified.
That genuinely made me wanna vomit. That's it, I'm gonna walk into a pond, pretend to be a frog for a while, and then die. fuck humanity, embrace frog.
just don‚Äôt use social media lmfao it‚Äôs just that easy
Here's how I'd reply

""People are assigned a gender at birth based on their, one which determines thier name, pronouns, how they are expected to dress and look, and many other things. To think everyone would be happy and comfortable with the gender assigned to them is ridiculous and to force them to stay in an identity they dislike is cruel and tyrannical. It is none of your business how someone expresses themselves and how they identify themselves. I will be supportive of my daughter no matter what gender she wishes to be. My child's sex is not relevant to how they want to express their gender identity...a penis does not prevent her from being able to identify as a girl, wear dresses, and use she/her prounouns to identify herself as she desires. I hope someday you'll look beyond your discomfort and open up to seeing trans people as a natural result of assigning people into a gender identity at birth. This is goodbye, my daughter and I do not need a negative influence like you in our lives.
Tell your ""friend"" that just because they don't understand it it doesn't make it wrong.  Link them to the gender dysphoria Bible in case they'd like to educate themself.
Block, block, block. This sounds like a religious person (I grew up in it). From my experience they're often very critical of people changing their body to be more comfortable for themselves because of the assumption they were ""made"" and not a result of happenstance. The assumption that vaginoplasty will be used for a man's pleasure is stupid, there's so many other reasons (but pleasure is also valid sooooo...). Some people are asexual and still get the procedure because they have dysphoria (me in a few years). Also, the concept of ""sin"" is used to control and subdue people to prevent them leaving their religion. Sex is normal and exploration is healthy, so it doesn't even matter in the end. This person seems hella concerned with how your daughter presents, what her genitals are and it's none of their business. Tbh it's perverted as all fuck. They talk down to you with a complete lack of respect or intention to learn, which is going to be difficult if this person is a part of your life somehow. I'm sorry you have to deal with people like that. I live as myself, presenting as female because that's who I am. Anyone who has a problem with that has a problem with themselves; I'm not the problem because all I'm doing is existing, as myself.
Just block them. Nothing they're saying is true, you don't need that in your life.
Id for one report them to facebook for harrasment, tell them to go fuck themslves (or some variation of it) and block them
Just block them? Don‚Äôt waste your time with idiots
Know...personally I'd reply with something along the lines of look I appreciate you trying to look out for us (I'm aware they aren't but that's likely how they see it) but in the end she's my kid not your so I will continue to raise her and support her if you don't like it that's your own damn problem not hers
""no, I must do this...."" What they mean is no, I must be a c-unit, when in reality they should step back and mind their own fucking business.

This is what I would write:

 What's in my daughters pants is none of your business. Are you me? What gives you the notion, the audacity to even fucking think that you can comprehend saying this to us? To think you can tell me how to parent my own child. My child knows what's best for her. And as a DECENT parent I support her in her decisions. Unlike you showing me you are not supportive in this (friendship?).
The wise thing would be block without a word.

But knowing myself I‚Äôd probably act angrily-
This is absolutely revolting especially since she is talking about a fucking child, Please please block this person and worn all of your relatives with kids to stay the hell away from this woman. ü§Æ
I don't know if I would have a reply other then to say what a fucking creep.
They're literally sexualizing a 12 year old ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢
What genitals my daughter has is her business and hers alone, this does not involve you. My daughter only owes it to herself to be who she is and not who society or others say she is. This is who she is, if she wants to change or not change that‚Äôs for her to decide. My job as her parent is to make sure she‚Äôs happy, prepared for the world and to help her explore and find herself.

Your view on what ‚Äúpurpose‚Äù a vagina is for is very telling for how you think of women, goodbye I will most likely not be talking with you again.

That would probably be my response
Call them a cunt and tell them to stop talking about a child‚Äôs genitals
Pretty sexiest to assume the only use for there vagina would be ""to pleasure men"". So if a women is infertilie is her's just as useless to them? What of there a lesbian and don't want to be with a man, is that also going to be a problem for them? This is the problem with people like this, even if there remarks don't seem that bad at first (not really in this case but just in general) if you ever actually start to think into it you realize they either had to blatantly ignore so many things or have to have a ton more really bigoted and bat shit crazy ideals. Report that person, block them cause they don't even deserve a response, then go hug your daughter and tell them how much you love and support them.
I doubt either of these will be helpful because I'm too furious to give you any sort of thoughtful ""murdered by words"" type of reply.  I've spent the last 22 years being relentlessly pestered by relatives about ""when \[I'm\] having babies and making them a \[grandparent/aunt/uncle/etc\]"", am currently waiting for a doctor's appointment to find out whether or not I was *born* sterile, and so I have to apologize to you that I've triggered super hard at the ""A child is the parent's property, and exists for no reason than to breed grandchildren"" mentality on display here.

Here's the best responses my rage-addled mind can come up with:

""My ***daughter's*** quality of life is not and will never be second to your desire to see her have children.  My child is her own person, not property or livestock...I have no idea why *you're* so invested in *my* daughter reproducing, not to mention that only truly sick fucks spend that much time thinking about a *12-year-old child's* genitals"".

Either that, or

""My daughter is leaving masculinity behind, and is still a bigger man than you'll ever be.""
You should know that your daughter is going to deal with people like this nearly every day of her life. This is one idiot in a sea of millions. This one's just a keyboard warrior. We have to deal with way worse than this guy all the time.
Well, unless this is someone with some kind of power over you, ""You are a bigot with no knowledge. Go talk to trans people and genuinely listen and try to learn. I may let you get back in contact with me if I see that you have educated yourself."" followed by unfriending them and never talking to them again is a valid response.

You are welcome to try to educate them, but trying to educate them is unlikely to work and is likely to upset you and waste your time. They are clearly bigoted and unwilling to really come to the table and talk with trans people or even our allies. This person seems like they know nothing about being trans OR about biology but they decided they are an expert and likely won't listen to evidence.

Do not let this person anywhere near your child if possible. They are not a safe person.
OMG I WISH I HAD A MOM LIKE Uüíï
the fact that they‚Äôre even bringing up your child‚Äôs genitalia in a sexual manner is an extremely big red flag to never associate with that person again. maybe a restraining order too.
I think you said it best when you said ""I don't have any sons.""
They don't deserve any further of your time.
Facebook usually means braindead (at least here in Europe and Spain); a report and block are the right choice for these kinds of people. 

Don't waste your time
Hmmm okay so don't befriend that person, doesn't seem like they'd be a good friend or a good influence on your daughter's life. In addition that person isn't very well informed and clearly has never done any actual research on the matter and is literally spouting nonsense and ""propaganda"" like a crazy person.a friend of mine went through something similar to this with her mum and one of her mum's ""friends"", the friend started getting really aggressive towards her daughter after a while and they had to get the police involved and after they arrested her mum's ""friend"" (who was a priest) they found a bunch of Nazi flags and KKK robes and all sorts of messed up tuff in his house so just be careful because this person could be really harmful towards you and your family.
I'm so grossed out at how they're talking about a child's genitals. Absolutely disgusting. Also the way they're talking about how a vagina will only be for a man's pleasure like that would have any substantial impact on that future decision or assuming your child would be straight? (Or really all trans women according to their comment) truly concerning.
If you haven‚Äôt answered, you could simply state something like this ‚Äúmy DAUGHTER has a right to be who SHE is and YOU have no say in what SHE can and can not do, my daughter is more comfortable being my daughter then my son, and if you cannot accept that then this is our final exchange of messages‚Äù then block them, that‚Äôs how‚Äôd I‚Äôd go about that
I don't know about your daughter, but with my son it was all about mental health. Anxiety, depression, migraine, even some OCD disappeared when she came out and transitioned. If you have had anything like that with your daughter, perhaps ask about whether this person suggests returning to that crippling level of mental health?!
I'd ghost their ass. Your daughter and you have a bond for life, this jerk is just trying to force their views with no knowledge or sensitivity to the impact just because they think they have the right. Get support of people who actually give a shit about your and your daughter, even if that includes getting advice from a gender affirmation counsellor to bounce ideas off. This jerk is part of the reason that trans kids go through so much shit. He is part of the problem.
You shouldn't have to justify your daughter's existence to someone who doesn't love them.

This person won't see past this. Most transphobes can't see past it until someone they love comes out as trans and many don't grow or change when that even happens; many people break ties with them just for that.

As much as protecting your daughter is important, trying to fight someone who wouldn't ever understand anyways is just gonna make it worse on everybody.

Theres good articles out there for evidence on way this is natural and just as normal as any idealistic transphobic universe, but they won't listen.

You could say its not this person's choice whether or not your daughter becomes what they want your daughter to. They don't control your daughters life. And that you support your daughter.


If you keep fighting with this bitch of a human, it'll show. Keep that freak away from you, away from your daughter, make sure that person can't find any information to find your family because at this point do you know this person enough to feel they won't do anything stupid? Can you trust that person wont try something harmful?

I am begging you to block them. Make sure you keep no contact. Keep your child safe. Make sure you can stay safe so that you can continue supporting and protecting your child.

If you want to reply all you can do now is remind them what rights they actually have over your child. None. But after that BLOCK THEM.
Yeah... I may not be the best to give a reply either. Anything I am coming up with is increasingly violent and probably wouldn't help much.
My attempt at a reply, speaking strictly as a parent: 

*ahem*

""Wow, so many false assumptions there I wouldn't know where to start. Good thing it's not my job to educate you. Move along.

Oh, and 'plastic vagina' would be a great name for a rock band. Thanks for that.""
Honestly I would unfriend this person and keep a Witch out for the person and not hesitate calling the police
unfortunately, as someone who has had SO MUCH patience with transphobes in the past, and truly believes in positive change through individual/community connection etc etc......... just block this piece of trash. not gonna listen to a word of what you say bc they have their own shit to work through, and it's only gonna dig em deeper into their own views. it makes me sad to realize that sometimes the only way people can either change or stop negatively affecting you is to just not engage.
I would honestly just block them, don't even bother responding. You are not going to be able to get anything from this, and the fact that this person is talking about your 12-year-old daughter's body like that is extremely uncomfortable and concerning, I wouldn't try to reason with them, just block and forget about them.
If I were you I would simply block and move on. This person has forfeited the luxury of being in your life by disrespecting you and your daughter (who I take it he hasn‚Äôt even met? side note: it‚Äôs extremely creepy and weird for him to be talking about the genitals of a child he hasn‚Äôt even met!)

You‚Äôre better than him. You don‚Äôt owe him an explanation. If you‚Äôre going to say anything, imo it doesn‚Äôt need to be anything more than ‚Äúbye!‚Äù
You will never explain the reality to a transphobe. I would just say something like ‚ÄûSadly your lack of information, all the misinformation and your own emotions lead me to draw a line. Stop contacting me, this leads nowhere‚Äú
I would say ""Fuck you."" But maybe that's too harsh.
Yeah‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think you need to respond. Honestly, I think you should block this person on social media, and your life.
I'm mtf, 17yo, my mom is very supportive and I would fully expect her to cut this person out of her life on the spot if that ever happened to us, it's the highest level of disrespect that someone can have and it's just not something you want to keep around
Tell her that your kid doesn't exist for others
Don't worry about this more than you need. It's not in your power to change that person's ideas, just keep your daughter and yourself safe. If you engage too much, it's only going to make them stronger and you weaker. Think happier thoughts, be healthy, imagine saying a juicy ""fuck you"" to their face and move on
Just block the creep, tbh. You don't need someone who is that obsessed with your 12 year old child's genitals in your life. I don't think anything you say will change their mind, and they're not worth the effort of trying. Especially if they're not even someone you know irl and you just sometimes bump into eachother online
If you really want to argue with this person you could start at the biological point:
In biology are several ways to describe the sex of a person (hormones, chromosomes, body parts, etc.). Each one of these characteristics appears on a spectrum e.g. a micropenis is very close to a clitoromegaly. This variety brings a problem: How should you determine when someone is a women or a men? Well the answer from a biological point of view is that we simply can‚Äôt exactly determine this. Now you may be thinking that we are closer to intersexuality rather than the TG-topic. Well not really!Because we are not able to tell wether phenomena such as body dysphoria have a neurobiological reason. It could be that our gender identity is determined in our brainchemistry. As we can‚Äôt tell for sure now we just have to take the feelings of the people who suffer from body dysphoria serious we have to help them to like their body. We know from so many pointless attempts that this is not possible with a C0nvers10ntherapy but very well achievable with surgery, hrt and most importantly FUCKING ACCEPTANCE!!! This is by far the most important part people who describe transpeople as mentally ill are biologically spoken idiots who don‚Äôt know their stuff and the mental damage they cause with their words. Even though the mental health of queer people isn‚Äôt the best, this mostly comes from poor acceptance and social or cultural pressure.
Why the fuck does anyone care about some other persons kids opinions on their genitalia. Jesus christ. Fucking insane behavior.
I obviously don't know how important this person is to you, but I would just tell them to go fuck themselves and block/report. They're going waaaaaaaay over the line of what's acceptable in any circumstance.
""plastic vagina""

I love it when transphobes don't even know what they're fighting. Makes it all the more easier to tear them apart.
Someone posted a jon Oliver quote earlier that said something to the effect of ""some transgender people will medically transition, some will get surgery, and some won't. And medically speaking, it's non of your fucking business."" 

This person has decided to cross a boundary you set, saying not to go into this topic. Their opinion is not wanted, and yet they gave it anyway. I'd say report their comment(s), for as much good it'll do, and then block them. 

You can tell them it's not their business, especially so given they're talking about a literal child at this point, but don't feel like you owe them an explanation either, especially for someone who (I hope) isn't even aware that this is happening, and who is simply trying to be happy. 

I don't know if you actually know this person or if they're more of a friend of a friend kind of thing, but definitely do not allow them to take any more of your time or energy with their twisted obsession (seriously, NOBODY should be *that* interested in a child's genitals... To me at least, it seemed like there was a bit too much focus there, maybe I'm reading things that aren't there, idk)

It might also be good to talk to your daughter if you think she's mentally mature enough to handle the topic, about people like this, and help practice shutting them down, blocking them, escaping or finding help, and how to handle the stress and such from dealing with them. As terrible as it is that it's still something we have to deal with, it would be better to have her aware of some ways to manage if she does end up encountering them, online and especially in person. 

You don't have to show her these comments, since that could definitely be a bit too much, but at least going over how to report and block people, learning when to stop ""debating"" these people, and so on would definitely be a good start. 

I'm so, so sorry you have to deal with this... But if it helps at all, it's wonderful you care enough to ask for help with it, and I hope it isn't too much to say that we're all in support of you and her.
Time to disingage with that person, that still sticks though!
That doesn't even deserve a reply. Just delete their comments, block them, and move on with your life. You can't fix stupid, and that person  is just above and beyond moronic.
Things to do besides take the time to educate an asshole who won‚Äôt listen: sign petitions in the states that are bringing transphobic legislation, write to politicians in your area to influence them to do the right thing when voting on trans legislation. Join a phone bank to bring awareness to citizens about what their politicians are doing to innocent trans kids. Buy some trans affirming childrens books and donate them to a local teacher or library. Join the group Free Mom Hugs and take part in their activism. Find an org that supports trans kids and make a post on your social media letting your other internet followers know about that amazing org. Join a regional trans parents support group. This is the beginning of a lot of fights that you will have to fight to help your daughter, don‚Äôt waste your resources on internet bigots.
BLOCK
People that imagine there's one transgender surgery obviously have no idea what it's actually like to be transgender. No surgery is leaving people with plastic vaginas either, that person has no idea about what they're talking about. It's a bit of a dunning-kruger situation because they don't know how little they know. On top of that they're transphobic so it's really frustrating.

That person is saying talk to your son, so you can respond that you did talk to your daughter and told her you'll always love her and protect her from ignorant transphobes like that person.

Btw I know this is unrelated but there is a difference between dysmorphia and dysphoria as you mentioned dysmorphia in the title. Trans people usually have dysphoria though some could also have dysmorphia in the same way as cis people.
your daughter is TWELVE? it's so creepy how transphobes like this are so hyper focused on a twelve year old's genitals. a 12 year old's sex life. the idea of who that 12 year old might have sex with in the future. what the fuck? they're not gonna be her partner, so that's not their fucking business
Say that their opinion doesnt count since its your child, say ""fuck you"" and block them. :)
I've read that the Y chromosome is pretty much empty besides like eye/hair color and some cosmetic stuff. The only real thing it does is trigger production of testosterone. Everyone has the genes for the expression of male or female features. This person is just spouting outdated horse shit.. tell him to go suck a bag of horse cocks and then block the cunt. That's what I do to these people. The never change your mind and nothing you say will do anything
SMH what is wrong with people
""Plastic vagina""

^^what
Yeah I think police should know that some fucking creep is interested in your kids genitals.
Just block
Your child has a right to be whoever she wants to be, make it clear she's not being pushed either way, and she's happy. I don't think any more needs to be said.  
All the bigotry aside, 'plastic vagina' is straight up wrong.
‚ÄúI hope that you can find enough peace in your life that you no longer feel the need to attack my 12 YO daughter over who she is. Take care and don‚Äôt communicate with us again‚Äù or simply, ‚ÄúI would talk to my son‚Ä¶ if I had one‚Äù
Cis parents of a trans child, You are not responsible for others opinions, or  thoughts. You are not responsible for trying to make them understand, thats entirely on them. They have clearly decided they dont want to know, and wish to be hurtful. Thats their choice.  
Your only choice is to cut that kind of rubbish out of your life, without comment or notice or chances.  


As i told my father (who was transphobic), you dont need to understand it, how it works, or even agree with it, you just need to use the right pronounds and name, and not talk about it otherwise
tell them to shut the hell up with their bigotry and cut them out of your life
Honestly, I would delete any public post that attracts such comments.  You aren‚Äôt going to win a debate with trolls, and it‚Äôs not worth sacrificing you or your daughter‚Äôs mental health, safety, or privacy.
This person‚Äôs view of reality is so distorted that I have no idea how I would respond, but I will say that it‚Äôs always so weird to see the obsession that transphobes have with trans children‚Äôs genitals, it creeps me out every damn time.
Tell ‚Äòem to fuck off and mind their own damn business.
Possibly more politely than that though.
Honestly? Here‚Äôs what you should say. Word for word, because people like this are scum.

‚ÄúGet Lost, (name). It‚Äôs none of your business what they do to their body. If you aren‚Äôt going to be happy, stay out of their life.‚Äù
That‚Äôs a friend? Even if we look past the transphobia there is also some sexism in that text by saying that a vagina is useless unless it is pleasing a man
What right do they have to dictate you how to treat your daughter? Simply say that they have no business pushing their abusive ideologies onto you and your family, block the bitch and never interact with them even outside of internet. Don‚Äôt try to ‚Äúre-educate‚Äù or even reply. Don‚Äôt waste your time on such POS.
'I know that my daughter has the right to be a man if SHE so chooses. It's not up to you to decide that for her. Much like you have the right to decide to not be a cunt.'
Cut that douche out of your life. They‚Äôre a transphobic (and probably also homophobic, judging by that reaction) piece of sh\*t. They‚Äôre not a real friend, and will probably just continue to harass your daughter if you don‚Äôt cut them out
I'm a cis male and do not in any way want to speak for anyone, but people like this one who purposefully use the wrong gendered pronouns when talking about trans people very much annoy me, so this is the solution that I have come up with.  
  
I figured that since they apparently seem to think that it isn't a big deal to call people by whatever pronouns they like, then they should have no problem with me picking pronouns to use when referring to them! So the pronoun that I am choosing to call them is the descriptive pronoun 'asshole'.   
  
I'm sure that none of the assholes out there have a problem with the pronoun that I have choosen to call them by. After all, if the asshole had a problem with their new pronoun, it would be somewhat hypocritical of that asshole. Of course, if they ask me to not call them that, I will have to tell them that they are obviously an asshole, and that I will not participate in their delusion that they are anything but an asshole.   
  
I think that it is important that I also remind the asshole that being an asshole is a choice, and that I will gladly use the pronouns that they like, just as soon as they stop being an asshole.   
  
I like this idea, but I would love to hear any thoughts about my approach when confronted with assholes. And PLEASE, if you believe that me calling them assholes in this manner is something that could possibly make anyone's life harder than it needs to be, then please tell me so that I can adjust my approach when dealing with these assholes. After all, my goal is to be the best ally I can be, and not just another asshole.
Just tell them to fuck off and stay away from your daughter.

Then cut them off completely.

Best thing to do.
Only necessary thoughts in response to this are ""You're not offering any enlightening help. You're just being ignorant and condescending. Please mind your own business because I have no need of help from you regarding this. Nothing you say will change the fact that I have no sons and a very happy daughter. Please don't try to contact me on this matter again.""

P.S. I am absolutely livid at this person and would scold them the fuck OUT if this was in person. Neither your daughter nor you deserve this. Please block this person if possible, they deserve 12 cavities.
The last word is theirs. Say nothing. Block and delete. Move forward. Don‚Äôt engage. Keep progressing. X
If it was me and that was my mum id be hurt my mum would continue to talk to someone who said that about me probably best to say notting but block
Shitty hieroglyphics person doesn't have a say over your daughter, knowing you for a long times makes no difference as they fundamentally are not trying to help her whatsoever.

Personally id just ignore them unkess they make or have made a habbit of it, as then its a core issue that can't be worked around.
‚ÄúI am uncomfortable with you talking about my child‚Äôs genitals, especially in a sexual nature. (Referring to talking about how her purpose will just be to satisfy a man‚Äôs genitals.) I‚Äôm not sure why you are obsessed with her genitals, but I am ceasing all contact with you to protect her from a possible sexual predator.‚Äù

Maybe not actually the best choice of words, but the best possible action.
Tbh what I'd do in this situation is, depending on how well you know this person, buy a jar of pickles. Then, open it, and bury it in your backyard for 8 years. Then, dig said pickle jar up, as it is now infested with dirt and bugs. Then make this person a sandwich, with said pickles in the jar.

Oh, or kick them in the appropriate genitals. Either or.
It sounds tough, but some people will never understand trans people. They‚Äôve been raised being told it‚Äôs not ok. They‚Äôve had no experience with trans people, and they‚Äôre not willing to learn. A lot of my friends were like this. Half of them were open to changing their mindset, and the other half weren‚Äôt. The half that weren‚Äôt open to changing their mindset, I had to cut off. It‚Äôs really tough, but in the long run, I‚Äôm much happier to be surrounded by people who accept me, and don‚Äôt treat me like I‚Äôm gross or other. 

Tell them that your child is MORE than genitalia. Being referred to as a boy causes her distress because she is transgender. She has a girl brain, and is a girl. Trying to tell people that don‚Äôt understand is difficult, and often times you have to simplify it greatly for them to understand.

Tell them that if they aren‚Äôt open to accepting your daughter, then you don‚Äôt think you can be friends with them.
Unfriend and block. If they can‚Äôt support your daughter, they can‚Äôt support you. There is no changing their mind and all they think they‚Äôre doing is telling you how ‚Äúit really is‚Äù when that isn‚Äôt how it really is. You have a daughter that will grow up to be a beautiful wife (if she so decides), a beautiful mother (if she so decides), a successful woman in all she does, and so happy with herself and her supportive mom. Anyone that isn‚Äôt supportive is just another person that does not deserve to be in your or your daughters life. You do not have to respond or try to educate her either. You can, if you want, but it‚Äôs not your place (meaning you aren‚Äôt obligated to). You can even give a last message before you unfriend her and block her, if you want. This woman sounds ignorant though, and is unwilling to change that. You aren‚Äôt responsible for trying to change it.
Block them. This is a wildly inappropriate way to speak about anyone, but ESPECIALLY A CHILD. They should not be thinking about your daughter‚Äôs genitals.
If you respond, you're just making it seem like their backwards-ass opinion matters enough to warrant thinking about. The burden of their education is on themselves, not you. Block them and move on.

Also, I am super sorry to hear that you're going through this. You seem like an amazing parent and one that I wish I had had growing up. You actually listen to and understand your child, and you educated yourself where you had to. Thank you for being such a wonderful role model for other parents. ‚ù§
There is not even the pretense of engaging you in good faith here. I wouldn't justify this with a response.
Tell them to fuck off. In More ""polite terms"", your daughters genitals are none of their business. They can only see someone as a machine for making children.
What the fuck is wrong with that disgusting inhuman abomination, i have never seen such a reprehensible pile of sewage and i live in a country that is run by them, don't respond cut all ties block them report them whatever you want but don't feed into them
Why do you need to answer to a so called ‚ÄúFriend‚Äù? She‚Äôs your daughter, defend her and leave your so called ‚Äúfriend‚Äù behind. You‚Äôre her parent you know what‚Äôs best for her and you get to decide who will be a part of your lives.
Why do they only think about sex?
The persons not a friend and you don‚Äôt need to talk to your child at all about this if she opts for the op or not as for opting for grand children that‚Äôs your daughters opinion on the matter if they give that to you also it‚Äôs going to be their kid first and your grand child second so all the decision is upto her. Period. 

You need to tell him to mind his own god damn business
Annnnnnnd blocked.   For real, why are they so concerned for your 12 yo's genitals?  They clearly know next to nothing about how transition works, especially for youth, and they clearly know nothing about being trans.  

Side note, why are transphobes so obsessed with women have to be able to give birth?  It's a dumb position even if trans folk didn't exist.
Tell him to fuck off, he's just a jerk
Not worth a reply or any engagement.
Block and report, simple
""Only to satisfy another mans genitals""??? 
MFer have you heard of self worth??????
Or like even if we go down the sex route, LESBIANS?!?!?!

This person says they want to befriend you but I straight up wouldn't trust them around your daughter. They'd do irreparable damage to her mental wellness.
Cut em out, i say.
I would be forced to tell her his ‚Äúv‚Äù is no more different than a cis female who elects not to have children. That is the most ignorant thing I‚Äôve read. I‚Äôd tell friend to focus on their own life because you‚Äôve learned people that concerned with controlling and judging others‚Äô usually has lots in their own that needs to be worked on.

Edit:  I would block the crap out of that person after I said what I said. No need in reading more hatefulness from her.
they think they're educated missionaries, don't help your kid and she will attempt suicide or will have heightened tendencies and thoughts, those people don't care about your children, they care about conditioning them to meet their criteria, and don't let them do that.

i was denied many things as a trans kid and it made me just more and more upset or disgusted with myself, not all trans people go on hormones, not all of them are going to get bottom surgery, and definitely not all trans people have bottom surgery for pleasing others, their genitals can bring even worse dysphoria in some cases and it can cause serious anxiety, depression and even bring them to suicide. children know their gender identity very young and denying her help will only make her sad and resent you. 

dont listen to the bitch she's so behind and so uneducated, help your kid as much as possible, i recommend discussing hormones in the next months, since starting them later can be a pain, and talk about surgeries years ahead. that person doesn't care about befriending you if they're so open of the prejudice and hate towards your child, i wouldn't waste my time with them. if you care about your child's well-being and safety block them. 

these things were vital to me but might not be for her

‚Ä¢ name change 
‚Ä¢ gender affirmimg clothes
‚Ä¢  hormones
Don't give those people the time of day. When my mother found out I was trans she responded by putting a knife to my throat. Some people are just going to be miserable and make it the world's job to be miserable too. It makes my heart ache you care so much for your girl to keep her safe and happy, sadly you can't do everything. My advice: don't waste time on people who know nothing about you and aren't worth it. There's litterly too many to even count or fathom trying to have a civil conversation with. Many whom will be unwilling so why bother? You don't need to justify your existence to legitimate human cesspools of pseudo ""morality"" and self loathing they unleashed onto others. You'll learn in time that they are sad lonely people and it's best to let them be sad and lonely while you spend your time being out and happy. I hope this helped a little even if it's not what you're entirely looking for.
My replay would be on the lines of,
""This is MY daughter and you have no say in this matter, her 'duty' is to live a fun life until she's 18 and learn everything she can in school not be a baby making machine to make you and your paper thin personality happy""
That‚Äôs fucked up on so many levels. I‚Äôd just say something like ‚Äúthis isn‚Äôt your business, this is her life, don‚Äôt force your bigoted views on others, now fuck off‚Äù
Do not reply. These people feed off of the idea that they're correct and getting under your skin. Your best way to deal with this transphobic idiot, is to just not. Do not waste your energy on this person. Do not let this person make you upset. 

If you must say anything. 

Ask them how often they talk about children's genitals. Ask them why your child's genitals are so important to them. Ask them if they talk about their own children's genitals. Usually if you start pointing out their weird obsession with children's genitals they will stop. 

But honestly if you could just block them and not say anything to that transphobic piece of trash. That would be best.
It's super creepy that a nother adult 
Is so hung up on you child's genitals
Dear X: My son decided ""he"" wasn't happy with a male body and being treated as a man, so he tried becoming a woman instead. Now, SHE is happier than ever, and I can see the difference in her smile.

How is a loving parent supposed to say no to that?

Anything else is irrelevant, and her personal decisions are none of your fucking business.

Sincerely, ________.
‚Äúthey have a right to be a man‚Äù
as if rights HAVE to be used at all times?
From my point of view, I think that you should tell them ‚ÄúShe is my daughter, and no matter what choice she takes, as long as she‚Äôs happy with it then i‚Äôll be supporting her in every moment that can make a difference between her enjoying her life or being unhappy and possibly hating her life. If she doesn‚Äôt wants her genitals then i‚Äôll be with her so she can have her reassignment, if she sees no problems with it, yet keeps wishing to be seen as my daughter then that‚Äôs the way it will be, because that‚Äôs what she deserves. Love, support and respect. And trying to convince her to not be who she truly would be like telling her that I don‚Äôt love her the way she is‚Äù I hope i haven‚Äôt said anything offensive against you or your daughter. And, lemme tell you, that you truly are a great parent, I hope that you and your daughter don‚Äôt get any complications on her fulfilling her dream, which, with the support of someone as amazing as you, will surely get to <3
Yeah that's insulting to say the least.
Just let it be. This person doesn't have a say on the way you raise your child neither has an opinion about it. Punching a brick wall will hurt yourself more than anything else. I feel really sorry for you having to pass through this kind of stuff. Just so you know, you're a wonderful person and your daughter is really, really lucky for having you.
What's their deal with trans people and your daughter in particular?
Tell her to find something better to do with her pathetic, short life than obsessing over stranger's children's genitalia over the internet
Do not reply this person. And wtf is that befriend in real life shit? Do you not know this person???? 

Ew
someone will always have a problem with you no matter who you are or what you do, so just take no notice of them and get rid of them out your life
Tell them if they don't want to support your daughter, whom they have NO right to dictate, they can take a fuckin hike :)
Arguing with these people is such a waste of time.  Apparently, this is some online-only connexion, you don‚Äôt even really know this person and they don‚Äôt deserve a response.  I often block people and accounts sans hangup. Fuck these assholes.  Block and move on.
""Okay I talked with my daughter and we agreed you should go fuck yourself"" then block. 

These people don't know what they're talking about, and you shouldn't waste brainpower trying to argue with them.
Fuck that guy
Jesus Christ this person should never be allowed women or children. What the fuck
Delete and block. Unfortunately, this won‚Äôt be the last time something like this happens and as much as we‚Äôd like to think we can educate others, all of these exachanges add up and end up harming you in the end. In my opinion üôÇ
I would ask you to consider what you expect to get out of confronting this person and continuing to interact in general. Do you think you can convince this person to change their mind? Do you *need* to change their mind for some reason? Certainly your daughter's legal rights don't hinge on this, and from what I've read it seems this person isn't important or even known to your daughter really.

But even if you think there's some value to convincing them, they aren't going to be if they aren't willing to listen with at least a partially open mind. If it were me, nothing I'm reading here screams to me that they're even interested in hearing alternative perspectives, and it's a lost cause. At least for now.

Obviously we do want to help convince people that yes, trans people are valid and should be treated as our true selves. Maybe someday they'll reconsider and change their mind. But you can't make that happen. None of us can either, and trying to persuade them is going to be futile at best and potentially harmful at worst.

It's where the quip, ""it's not my job to educate you"" comes from. That education needs to happen, but a hostile and unwilling student does not make for a proper opportunity. For your own sanity and your daughter's safety, my recommendation would be that if you're able to cut them out, do so.
Someone is going to fucking perish today
tell her to 1. worry about her own genitals, 2. stop talking about your child's genitals, 3. who your child is is not up for debate, and 4. unfriend you if she can't stop being a creep
Jeez, this ""~~friend~~"" needs some sort of education..
I recommend to just cut this person out of your life period what they are doing is damaging to not only your mental health but your daughters if she ever caught wind of this later on in life so my recommendation don‚Äôt reply just block them and move on
‚ÄúI must‚Äù

They mustn‚Äôt. Just an overall bad person who thinks they‚Äôre on some kind of holy crusade and that you owe them for their ‚Äúinsight‚Äù.
Oh they will be getting blocked. I just want the final word on this matter before I do so. I don't wanna block them without saying something in her defence because this person will think that that is me admitting that they are right. I'm just so fucking angry that I can't put in to words what I want to say. I keep typing and deleting.
Luckily, my daughter doesn't know this person and I would never subject her to their obviously wrong opinion. I will be blocking them too once I've had my say. I'm just absolutely livid rn and can't get my thoughts on order. I'm not blocking them til I've explained how and why they are wrong though. I may have to sleep on it.
Agreed, OP calls her a friend but my advice would be to never speak to her again.
Imagine talking about operations and its purpose for apprently ""just serving another man's pleasure"" in regards to a 12 year old. This is just disgusting. Delete him as a friend, and delete his comments before  your daugther sees it.
My step brother is semi-famous and he knew he was a boy at three years old! He is now 33 and living his best life as the man he truly is. He has books published in America and England about his feelings of being stuck in the wrong body in school. His books are actually being distributed to schools. 
You have just given me a great idea of sending my ""friend"" the link to my step brothers book. That really explains everything!
So quite honestly, trying to explain yourself to them is a waste of time. They're not going to be swayed by pretty much anything you say, and it's just going to be a drain on your time and energy. You are going to encounter people like this over and over again for years to come. In this instance you can simply say, ""I'll actually be going with the advice of experts on this, have a nice life."" and block them. Protect yourself and your daughter by not extending your energy to people with bad intentions. You don't owe them an explanation, a justification, or literally any information about this at all. They can go be mad somewhere else.
I‚Äôm not sure how great I am with words but here are some of my thoughts about how I feel being a trans woman and how it feels to have a relatively supportive mother ‚ò∫Ô∏è

So I only realised recently that i was a trans woman about 7 months ago, but since then i‚Äôve had one thing become extremely obvious, and that was how my life before was super miserable and sad and i can tell now that that was largely due to all of these repressed feelings. For me I had horrible experiences all throughout my teens because of how unhappy i was with myself i think. Once i realised i was trans i actually started to feel good sometimes and even though things are hard i am so much happier now and i can‚Äôt imagine life if i hadnt realised. It wasnt a choice for me at all, the only way for me to honestly live my life was for me to begin transitioning. And one of the things keeping me going is how much support i have. My mother has been very supportive and she‚Äôs definitely not perfect but i don‚Äôt expect that at all. I have incredible friends and a girlfriend too! I think that even with all of the support from my friends, if my mother didnt support me i would be a lot more unhappy. But she supports me and she‚Äôs teaching me new things and i know i couldnt do this without all of the people i love! For context im 19 so im probably older than your daughter but i hope this helps a bit! I‚Äôm really sorry you have to deal with things like that, but i hope that you‚Äôre able to have a nice day even still! ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Unfortunately not, some people are really bigoted and far too interested in how others live, and making sure they fit the very box prescribed to them.

I love that you support your daughter, I'm sure it means the world to her even if she doesn't have words to describe her feelings. Learning how to exist in this world can be really hard, especially as a trans person. My parents and extended family have been abusive and unsupportive and it hurts because it forces me to recognise their values are harmful to others, despite having been looked after relatively well, inbetween the abuse (stockholm?). Seeing parents supporting their trans children makes me really happy, because I know those children have one less source of trauma as well as support in the things they do experience.

For me, I felt uncomfortable with my genitals and gender as early as 2. I went to kindergarten in girls' clothes once because it felt more aligned with myself but the way my family and kindergarten made me teel embarrassed taught me early about transphobia or at least the concept of controlling people with no reason. I've always conducted myself more femininely than my peers in school, and I never understood why until I realised other people don't feel like they're in the wrong body. Knowing I have the opportunity because of medical science to change the parts of myself that give me intense dysphoria is incredibly encouraging because it makes me feel like I have the opportunity to change the things about myself I have been uncomfortable with for pretty much my entire life. Why would you deny someone of that? Some people don't feel the need for surgery or other procedures, others do. It's nobody's decision but the one with the body.
I can‚Äôt say to what it means to be supported from a young age but I can speak to what it felt like to have the wrong body and not be supported.

 This was back in like 2007 or so. I felt like a freak, a monster, broken‚Ä¶ society told me that I was a boy, boys don‚Äôt want cute things, boys don‚Äôt want to be a girl or treated like one, boys don‚Äôt get to cry, boys don‚Äôt get to show emotions, boys don‚Äôt get help. If you don‚Äôt fit in as a boy your a freak, the but of jokes, broken, opening yourself up to bullying, so why would you bring on all that pain. Surely it‚Äôs easier to live with hating yourself for who you are and not all of your friends, family and society hating you, surely all of them combined are stronger than you and they will just force you back down so why even try, just sit back and hate yourself, it‚Äôs easier. 

The strongest thing I felt was that I was broken, a freak, a monster because I was different, different from what society said I had to be and I hated feeling like that. So I hated having these feelings of wanting to be myself, so I hated myself. To have been supported and told it was ok if I had those feelings that other people have them too and it‚Äôs ok‚Ä¶ I can‚Äôt even imagine how much happier I would of been, it brings me to tears remembering it but it makes me want to speak out and show others that it‚Äôs ok. I don‚Äôt want the next generation to share my pain.
Defend nothing. Explain nothing. Just send him [this clip](https://youtu.be/hmoAX9f6MOc?t=160) (from 2015, by the way!) and block him and be happy that your daughter will be happy and confident in the sure knowledge that you are doing right by your child.
I grew up in an incredibly transphobic family so i didn't realize I was trans until i was 18 but i knew i wanted to be a girl since i was 3. I knew i wanted to be able to get pregnant, i wanted to be able to just like be a girl, i tolerated being a boy because until bro recently i didn't know it was possible for me to be a girl but if i had magically transitioned one day i would have been so happy. My childhood dysphoria just made me so unhappy and miserable but i had no words to express what i was feeling because i was raised Catholic [am atheist now] and homeschooled and isolated and told that being trans was a mental illness and trans people go to hell, so i just repressed and repressed and almost ruined my life. I'm so happy for your daughter that she's being raised by parents who are actually supportive and actually love her, like seriously thank you for actually loving your daughter
If you MUST send a message I'd recommend sending a link to this article: 
https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/stop-using-phony-science-to-justify-transphobia/
And leave it at that. They'll have to choose to learn from it but they can do that on their time. Be thankful this person only exists in the vacuum of Facebook and can be flushed away like a turd with the click of a button.
At the very least, their last comment is highly utilitarian and misogynistic. If someone chose to get the op, it's not because they want to have sex, it's because they'd feel happier with a different set of genitals. The way they phrase it makes it out like they treat women like walking vaginas. 

If you want more personal experience-based stuff, my experiences earlier on in my life often revolved around wishing for nothing more than to be the opposite sex, or pretending to be when people weren't around, or trying to look up how to do a voice for the opposite sex. The reason I couldn't come to terms with it until later was because I was never given it as an option and was forced into my gender roles, which made me miserable. Being misgendered or especially deadnamed nowadays feels less like a slap in the face and more like all of my closest friends and family members gathering in a circle to scream slurs and ridicule me. Any time it happens it ruins the day, or more. I could call back to the most recent time my mother accidentally deadnamed me (two hours or so before I normally go to sleep for the record) and I spent the rest of that day in tears. Explain to them that being rude to your daughter for something she cannot control and particularly in this manner is so, so destructive for her mental health. If you've ever heard transphobes cite the ""41% suicide rate"" statistic, that statistic refers to trans people who have been denied support by their families. Trans people who are accepted and have completed their transition are actually generally happier than cis people on average.

I'm not sure how much this will help but I hope it does
Also there's like a lot of post-op transbians right?
Soooooo creepy. What about her pleasure lol? What does it mean for cis women, their genitals are just to pleasure men and bear children? Too bad it seems she never experienced pleasure
also may i add that this is a 12 YEAR OLD GIRL WTF
I'm so sorry that you have been essentially forced to live a lie. I am a cis woman and I often put myself into a trans person shoes by imaging that I am stuck in a man's body. I know I'm a woman. I feel like a woman. I take all those feelings and imagine that I have a man's body. It feels *awful*.
Does your current wife not know you are really a woman? I'd like to offer you an ear if you ever need somebody to talk to ‚ù§Ô∏è
Thank you for sharing your experience with me. It really reinforces that I'm doing the right thing. 
If she turns round in a few years and decides she is a boy, or NB, then I will be here for that too.
At the end of the day, she's my baby and will always be my baby. As long as she is happy, healthy and not harming others, then idgaf.
I'm definitely going to reply. I just wanna get my thoughts in order first and make.sure I cover everything.
I am absolutely starting it with that!
This is brilliant! Thank you!
I'm definitely going to reply to them. I can't not. We have lots of friends in common and I have a sneaky suspicion that some others feel the same way.
After my reply, this person is getting blocked and I'll be asking any others who feel the same way to unfriend me.
He will definitely be getting blocked. I just wanna get my licks in first.
Yeah he knows me, but he doesn't know my daughter. 
If he did, he would know that she is 100% a sassy lil diva üíÖüèª
She has *never* been a boy, even when she was a boy.

.....and omg that is going into my reply. Thank you for the inspiration xx
I hate that parents that accept their kids get praise for doing the absolute minimum that a parent should be doing anyway.
It's heartbreaking when I hear about people getting disowned for stuff like this that that doesn't matter in the grand scheme of things.
I don't care if anyone is 5 or 85. If they have been disowned by their parents for being part of the LGBTQIA+ community, I'm their new mum now ‚ù§Ô∏è

*To anyone reading this: my Inbox is always open if anyone needs to chat*
Sorry, my bad! I'm glad you corrected me before I replied. Have I made that word up? üòÇ
I really don't understand why other people care so much about something that has absolutely no effect on their life. I mean, ffs, my child transitioning has no effect on **my** life, so I don't get why random strangers are so arsed about it!
It's not in my nature to say fuck all
I really struggle with not having the last word and if I don't say anything back, I know this person will think they have ""won"". They know I'll always argue til I'm blue in the face.
>First off my daughter hasn‚Äôt decided on surgery yet she is x yrs, so I‚Äôd kindly appreciate it if you would stop thinking about her genitalia plz,

I love this! It would have never occurred to me to bring up this point.
They are part of my troll fam. It varies slightly but the gist is we pretend to be Christians who hate tattoos and weed. We do a whole satire thing. 
There are a few that love my daughter and they are the only ones she knows of.
I wish I had read this before I replied to him!. Here's what I said

The only thing that will change my mind about my daughter....is my daughter.
If she decides in the future that she's a boy, or NB, or something else, then I'll hold my hands up and say that on 27/03/22 I was wrong calling her a girl.
Idgaf who/what she feels like/presents as.
As long as she's happy, healthy and not hurting others, then I'm good.
And don't worry, my fb ""friend"" will be getting told, right before they get blokt

Honesty, I feel like I can't let it go cuz of the type of relationship we have. We troll together in a satirical way. We pretend to be Christian extremists that hate tattoos and weed. I've always had the last word. Just struggled this time cuz it was personal and I was so angry.

But I love some of the points you made and I'm making a note of them
My profile is locked down. This person was on my friend list.
I think the simplest is, ‚Äòmy daughter‚Äôs genitalia is none of your business and it disgusts me that that‚Äôs what‚Äôs on your mind‚Äô, then a block.
I know that anger really well. I have lost sleep for days over that type of anger and that type back and forth. I've gotten the last word and honestly didn't bring me any peace. That anger stays until you can move past it.

The reality is, once you've blocked them and push them out of your life, you won't even remember who had the last word. This is something you feel in this moment. If you want to reply, if you feel absolutely compelled too, it should be something simple. Just say something the effect of I'm a good parent who wants to do what's best for my child. And I know what's best for my own child. She is exactly who she says she is and I will always support her in that.
Late to the party.

‚ÄúThe fact that you are concerned about the genitals of a 12 year old makes me wonder if you don‚Äôt want my daughter to get the surgery because you would prefer to play with a 12 year olds penis.  If that is what you are admitting then I suggest you seek professional help.  If not, what impact does my daughters choices have on your life?  You are either a pedophile or a bigot and I want neither in my life.‚Äù
Tell them it's hard for you to imagine someone being that stupid, and move on.
Trying to explain them why they are wrong is impossible because they won't see it they will refuse..basically right now you are drinking poison and hoping they die. You are just suffering for no reason, just block them and be done
[deleted]
The simplest replies are often appropriate.  I'd simply tell them ""*You're a horrible hateful person and I hope someone treats you as badly as you treat and view transgender people""* /block.
I would save your mental energy by not bothering to reply to this. Simply block and then try to move on with your life.
Tbh, I've learned you can't explain it enough, it takes energy out of you, and they won't change their perspective. Just tell them you don't want anything to do with them anymore, and block them
It‚Äôs unfortunate but there is nothing you could ever say to change people like that‚Äôs minds. They will never change or see the wrong of their actions or mindsets.

The best thing you can do for your mental health is just block and move on.
Can people even see your page or comments after you block them though?
While I admire your desire to show them why they‚Äôre wrong, I doubt your words will do anything to change their mind. I advise you block and report them, and cut ties completely. Also block them on your daughter‚Äôs account, if she has one.

That desire for the final word is going to do more harm than good.
dw about it, you did the right thing, and also you sound like an amazing parent üíôüíô

best of luck to both of you!! and ty for being so accepting towards your daughter!
OP, you're a good parent. I'm glad that your daughter has the support she needs <3
Oh she has a trans uncle that's amazing !! You're amazing!!  what amazing family she has!!
what's the book? I'm interested!
>""I'll actually be going with the advice of experts on this, have a nice life.""

I love this and will absolutely be saying it. Thank you. Xx
Thank you so much for your input. Anecdotes are very helpful with what I wanna slap my ""friend"" upside the head with xx
I'm really sorry that you weren't supported. I am confidently cis but I always try to put myself in the shoes of others and so I often imagine being trapped in a man's body. It is *awful*.
It's crazy to me that people care so much about something that affects them in no way whatsoever! Like why does this FB friend who lives thousands of miles away from me give a fuck about how my child lives their life??
I love you so much for that link!! I'm currently typing out my reply to him and I'm halfway through that clip and already know it's going in there!
Yeah, like I haven't started yet but I was amab but I know I am most likely lesbian lol
yeah lol... if trans women's vaginas are only for men's pleasure, then cis women's vaginas are only for men's pleasure and to birth their babies.

I got SRS for MYSELF. To stop feeling like I had the wrong genitals and suffering because of that. Sex was literally the last thing on my mind (even if still mattered). And when it comes to sex... I didn't get it to ""pleasure a man"", I got it to be able to have sex without feeling dysphoria, and pleasure myself.

This person is a creep that talks about kid's genitals on social media and a mysoginy perpetuator with the notion that if you dont have an uterus, your vagina is only good to pleasure men.

Imagine if she said that to a woman that was born with MRKH Syndrome (without a vaginal canal and uterus) that got genital surgery to create the vaginal canal. Or if she said that to a woman who had to remove her uterus due to cancer.

It's disgusting no matter how you look at it.
Thank you so much for your offer. You are an amazing person with an incredible heart. No I have not told my current wife or daughter. Really it‚Äôs me not them. I believe it will go well. I hope it will go well. I have been on a wait list to see a psychiatrist that specializes in Transitioning cases. I‚Äôve been waiting since December. They followed up with me several weeks ago and said they are still really backed up. Heck I have waited this long to talk to someone what‚Äôs a few more months. I‚Äôve already started slowly transitioning. And it is enough for now. As I said you are an amazing momma bear and your daughter is in incredible hands!!
Ohmygod you are like the best parent ever, I would wish my parents would be even ever so close to that, but I fear it‚Äôs not the case‚Ä¶ (so I haven‚Äôt come out) Like genuinely this is amazing, every trans child deserves a parent like this‚Ä¶
It is my intention to accumulate more in the coming weeks, sort them into categories based on my observations of common anti-trans arguments, and then post a master list to this sub (including links).
Ah ok I didn‚Äôt realize about all the friends in common that makes sense why you‚Äôd want to stand your ground. I don‚Äôt know exactly what you should say but the part where they said your daughters hypothetical future would just be for a man‚Äôs pleasure is so messed up. I (late 30s cis M) have been in a relationship with a trans woman for almost a year now and it‚Äôs the most loving, respectful, fulfilling relationship of my life. Part of what I love about her is her strength and bravery and how much she knows herself, and that helps her see me too in a way previous partners haven‚Äôt. It sounds like your daughter has a great supporter in you and will grow up to be a great person. Sorry you‚Äôre dealing with this and wishing you the best
Do it lol. I have gotten a decent bit of hate in the past and I don't usually bother arguing unless I have a sassy comeback or something . Theyre not worth the anger tho it is nice seeing a protective parent on here
I know it's so infuriating, hoping other close friends/family are more accepting than that person. And gender dysphoria, or dysphoria, is being uncomfortable with your gender assigned  at birth  and things that come with that, such as looks, voice, genitals act. Body dysmorphia is similar, but not in regards to gender, just in regards to ones body. I probabaly didn't explain it the best but if you Google the difference between dysphoria and dysmorphia hopefully Google will be of help. Wishing you and your daughter a lovely day.
Then tell them you're cutting them off for their disgusting views before the block? Just don't give em a chance to respond. 

I know how it feels. My first year or so after coming out, I felt the full weight of transphobia crashing on me like an anvil. I felt like I had to fight every single bigot that came my way. 

It's healthier to just cut them out. <3
You're absolutely welcome ü§ó
That reminds me of a friend I once had. We had fun being edgy and trolling people, then eventually I realised he was just a toxic person. I cut him out when he started lashing out at random people in my life.
Purge anyone not supportive.  They aren‚Äôt friends.
This. This person sounds creepy and pedophilic, so definitely call them out on it before blocking them. Maybe add ""and I am going to block you, because I don't involve myself with people who try to police children's genitalia."" So as to explain why, if they reply more nasty shit, you don't reply back.
Oooh I like this!

For sure! Good luck with everything
u/genderqthrowaway3 is right, u/tastyhedgehog but I'd also like to add it doesn't hurt to say that you don't appreciate people trying to talk about your daughters privates as though they know everything, or talking about them at all: what they may be or may become.
Good choice. Classy, efficient, and honest. Everyone here is right, this person ain‚Äôt a friend and if they are ignorant enough to speak this way to you about your support for your own kid then they abandoned common sense and decency a looong time ago.  

Its ironic (/s) that the same people who preach ‚Äúmy choice!‚Äù about not masking or vaxxing their kids feel like they can turn around and dictate your choice to let your girl express who she is. They can take a long hike til the reach the edge of their flat earth, and once there keep walking. üôÉ

Thank you for being a supportive mamma‚Äîyour daughter is the age I was when I was forced to present exclusively as binary to my AGAB. Its been a long time unpacking all that alone in adulthood. The world needs more parents like you. ‚ô•Ô∏è
There is such a wait time for everything! I'm in the uk and my daughter is still waiting for an appointment with GIDS to get her hormone blockers.
Have you thought about how to bring it up with your wife? Is she accepting towards the trans community in general? I often try to put myself in other people's positions (like I said before though, I'm cis, so please disregard my thoughts if they are ignorant), and I imagine that if I wanted to come out to someone, I would stick something on the telly about trans people. Then start up a conversation about the character. Maybe ""Boys don't cry"" or - more tentatively - Tomboy. The latter is a film with Michelle Rodriguez in. It also goes by the name The Assignment. Wikipedia the plot of the that one before you watch it though! While it is absolutely not a reflection of your situation, it would certainly open up an avenue of discussion.
Again, I'm sorry if my suggestions suck. I just try to imagine how I would feel and what I would do. Admittedly though, I haven't always made the best life choices üòÇ
I may not be OP, but I look forward to seeing that!
>the part where they said your daughters hypothetical future would just be for a man‚Äôs pleasure is so messed up.

I can't believe I'm saying this but that didn't clock with me. I'm just so angry that I read everything and still didn't take it in properly. Even now, I can't remember what else he said. I'm gonna go back and read it until it's burned into my brain. 
My daughter loves hearing about trans women that end up in loving relationships. She is bisexual but worries that she will never find someone. 
I will for sure mention to her that I stumbled upon someone on Reddit who is in a very happy relationship with a trans woman and all the lovely things you said about your girlfriend. Xx
No, you explained it perfectly! Thank you!
And luckily, nearly everyone in my daughter's life accepts her. Her dad is the only person who doesn't, but he's an abusive piece of shit that has never done a thing for her (even bdays and Xmas) so it's no loss. He was given every opportunity to accept her and he *almost* had us convinced until he let let his mask slip during an argument and outed himself as a transphobe. My daughter made the decision to cut him out of her life. I'm glad she finally sees him for the monster he is.
All the more reason to cut him out of your life. You do not owe him any explanation
It's not your job to do their emotional labor. That's what they're asking you and your child to do. They want someone else to reassure them of the ""rightness"" of the binaries they grew up within. 

Well...it's sad that they want to remain a stick in the mud and project their insecurities onto a 12y-old.

What you're reading is, most likely, someone's identity feeling threatened and them not knowing or understanding why...and they probably can't recognize it because its never been threatened like this before. The lashing out? That's their identity clawing to maintain its security and position of ""being right"". It's what happens when anything feel backed into a corner.

To admit there are any other options beyond A-B, that there is a spectrum and slope...that throws their whole life into question. That they must attack a child in defense of their own insecurities -- that's the sad part here. I'm sorry for folks like this.

But again, it is not your duty to do their emotional and philosophical labor, to make them feel more comfortable, or do anything other than treat them with civil dispassion.

You may want to get a ""parting shot"" in, to make you feel like you had a retort. But unless you can do it was the dispassion necessary to not give them anything to feel justified about, your best move is likely a non-response, block, and cut them out of your family's life. 

TL;DR: Unless you're a lifeguard to who knows how to respond safely, don't let the drowning victim take you under with them.
Transgender or otherwise, an adult man talking about your child‚Äôs genitals (in a sexual context!!!!!) is wildly inappropriate. Point that out to him and block him.
And confidently incorrect.
If that is how he is choosing to speak to you about your daughter, plus you are certain that he is being genuinely honest about his feelings on this matter, then I really can't see any reason to keep him in your life. I have quite a few close friends, but I can't think of a single one of them that would allow me to stay in their life if I were to purposefully say things about their children that would be abusive if said directly to their child. 

I do understand the desire to jab back, but if he has this attitude towards your child when he's known you for 10 years.... I say just block him from your life, and save yourself some trouble.
He‚Äôs not going to change his views. He will continue to cause you harm.
Cutting out my ""troll"" friend who was just plain toxic under the mask of ""it's a joke!"" was the best choice for my mental health I have ever made lol. Do yourself a favor and give yourself some grace- neither you nor your daughter owe an explanation to someone who has now twice shown they will not listen to you. He just wants to be right :/ If he still won't change after you pour your heart out, it hurts much more than just telling them to never talk to you again.
Tbh, it might be easier to teach math to a dog than to actually get through to transphobes.
The dog will still love you after it fails too!
""As I can see, you perfectly encapsulate the average transphobe in that they're not that different from a hyperactive cat on adderall. Neither can grasp basic concepts, will never make a meaningful impact in the world and act like assholes and infants. However catss have atleast one person that loves them while you just cling to things that arent your business to make people feel bad about things that dont affect you for the faintest glimmer of hope to escape the bitterness thst is the life you built for yourself""

This is my routine response to transphobes. When they mention me having copied it word for word from a previous discussion with a transphobe I usually follow it up with 

""Youre a copy paste transphobe, so you get a copy paste reply.""
It looks like it got deleted unfortunately
Thank you for the ideas. I know I only get one chance and I need to make it as comfortable for her as I do for my daughter. My wife is apart of an LGBTQ+ Ally program through her work. So I am hoping that helps pave the way. My wife is very intuitive and I am sure she has noticed me working on my voice and mannerisms. She sometimes quips. You more womanly than I am. Which would give me an opportunity. My daughter tells me all the time a closet is no place to live. So need to handle this gently for them and sooner then later for me. I would really like to have a counselor at my side when I do it. Or at least on call when I do it.
Please do :)

And yeah the transphobic obsession with genitalia and the idea that trans people and those who love them are perverts is so revealing of how sad and empty their own love and sex lives must be. I‚Äôd feel sorry for them if they weren‚Äôt so hateful
Honestly, report that message. That is pedo-level saying that all your 12 year old daughter will be is a human fleshlight is so messed up. Honestly if you call out the reasons for bringing up genitalia online this will hit harder to them
Thank you for your reply. You have given me plenty of food for thought and I will be incorporating some of your reply onto my response to that bum flavoured cock goblin. Xx
Oh yes absolutely, didn't even occur to me like that.
Dogs are actually listening to you, something transphobes never learned to do
At least the dog will try.

It's awaiting mod approval.
Animals usually have already some kind of automatic math that they use to know how many predators there is a place or the distance between them and other point, you just need to figure out how to teach math to a dog in dog mathematics. 

Different from a transphobe, that don't have basic knowledge of the things they're talking about, so it's impossible to teach them how to act in human society.

The governor of Utah‚Äôs response to a ban on transgender people in Utah sports is encouraging and positive	"It‚Äôs not perfect, but a lot of it obviously comes from a place of kindness. He vetoed a bill banning transgender kids from competing in women‚Äôs sports when, at the last minute, the commission overhauled the bill that originally proposed inclusion after review. A bill that was built with the LGBTQ community where everyone found a compromise together and agreed to tweak the system continuously instead became a blanket ban at the 11th hour. The pull quote below is exactly the kind of thing I wish more people would realize, and it‚Äôs coming from the republican governor of a red state. Maybe there is hope for the trans community. I encourage everyone to read the whole statement. There is some transphobic language, but it seems to come more from a place of ignorance, not hatred.

https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/22/gov-spencer-coxs/

‚ÄúFour kids and only one of them playing girls sports. That‚Äôs what all of this is about. Four kids who aren‚Äôt dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don‚Äôt understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly. For that reason, as much as any other, I have taken this action in the hope that we can continue to work together and find a better way. If a veto override occurs, I hope we can work to find ways to show these four kids that we love them and they have a place in our state.‚Äù"	"Wow. Just read the whole thing and I have a couple of thoughts on this. 

1) It initially sounded like ""don't pass this because people will sue and we don't have the money to deal with that."" Just goes to show how short sighted their transphobia makes these legislators.

2) Towards the end of his statement, he does seem super sincere and as if he had given some thought into this decision that comes, as OP mentioned, a place of kindness. The excerpt you chose really captures that well, OP.

I guess one last thought, or hope rather, is that more of our political leaders, and equally as important, their constituents, can learn from this man and put as much thought (not that it takes all that much, let's be honest) as he has.
It‚Äôs encouraging for sure.  I hope other republicans take a fucking moment and consider what the fuck they are doing.  But I‚Äôm not very hopeful.
Sadly, I just heard that the veto was just over-ridden :(
I'm proud of him for taking a stand against his party and being compassionate, but unfortunately the party still outnumbers him and they're still going ahead with the ban, fuck America right now.
As someone who lived in Utah for a while, I think this message is more important than whether or not the law goes through. The law will probably go through, but I think everybody anticipated that. What people did not anticipate is a republican governor in a conservative state standing up for the rights of trans youth, and I think for a lot of kids who have grown up in an area where if you assume people want you dead you'll be right most of the time, seeing a prominent leader take a stand for you will mean a lot.
Yes, it's good that one Republican did the right thing. But then they decided to override his veto. So yeah.

I can't get that excited about one guy being decent, I guess, because he really is just doing the minimum in terms of being an ally.
You can tell that he doesn't really understand us, but he genuinely seems to want what's best for us. This honestly made my day
[deleted]
I'm impressed. There's a shadow theocracy in Utah, I almost can't believe this
This is America where people at least pretend to care about fairness. Everyone deserves a place at the table, it can just take some time to slide around the seating chart for a new friend.
The end of his statement got to me. It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see empathy like that but it was
This was just for show.  Maybe he's looking at a presidential bid.  

Whatever his real intentions, I don't know how any of you can trust a Utah Republican even a little.  You **can not** get to be the Republican governor of Utah with a clean conscience.

Look at loads and loads of our history.  These bastards only extend olive branches just to use our own compassion against us.  If you don't know your history, and know it from queer/black/indigenous sources, then just trust me this motherfucker is up to no good, but also, get read.
[removed]
I read through these threads and always see y‚Äôall bitching about transphobia. It‚Äôs not transphobia. There are many actions taken towards you folk that is hateful and menacing and horrible, but this isn‚Äôt one. Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. It‚Äôs not fair. I support your right to be who you are and live your life free from hate but physical competition is an area where I disagree on inclusion
Cox‚Äôs statement doesn‚Äôt surprise me.  He‚Äôs done it before.  At a 2016 vigil for the victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre, he made an equally incisive statement.  

Cox is far from perfect.  But unlike almost every other conservative politician at the state or national level, he‚Äôs a decent human being.  Sadly, he‚Äôs probably 10-20 years before his time.  

The crusade against us will continue for the foreseeable future.  The Republicans want to exterminate us, and have shown they will do whatever it takes to make it happen.  

But what many in our community don‚Äôt realize is this crusade is a last-gasp effort to maintain the patriarchal Christian white-male status quo.  To be sure, it'll be rough going.  But they‚Äôre too late.  Their crusade is bound to fail.  We‚Äôre too big and too powerful.  Younger generations are far more accepting as a whole.  We‚Äôll eventually see more politicians like Cox, even if they‚Äôre Republican.  Things will get better.
""Because there are logical and passionate arguments by many parties...""

Oh, have there been? /s
... Yeah I don't like this, one bit. I respect he's a politician but I just flat out disagree with some of what he says, especially talking about how this issue turns ""allies into opponents"". 

Yes, it does turn allies into your opponents, because the allies believe in fairness. He also talked about Lia Thomas and... as usual, a republican completely neglects the context as to why she performed so well, citing it as an ""egregious example"". I agree with his points on finance since that's seemingly the only thing republicans start conversations with, but I dislike how it's the forefront of his discussion. 

I'm just saying, if they really want to ban trans people from sports divisions that align with their identity, they should make Transmasc's play in the womens leagues too. I'd love to see the hilarity that ensues from that as long as the Transmasc's consent to playing in womens leagues at least to make a point.
Despite not being conservative, as a Utahn, Cox is not bad at all. Plenty of democrats in Utah actually registered as Republicans to vote for him in the primaries, as this being Utah we always swing red, but he was one of the best candidates they put forward, and actually seems to care about this state and the people in it, regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, or sexuality. If the democrats don‚Äôt put any good candidates forward this next election I‚Äôll probobaly be voting for him tbh.
Human decency. What a rare sight to behold in this day and age.
I live in Utah, and this gives me at least a little bit of hope. I just want to be myself and be happy. Maybe someday, things will turn out ok, I really hope they will. I just wish everyone could be accepting towards me, especially my family. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll come around. this give me hope that they might.
As a Utahn I‚Äôm proud to have this wonderful man to be our governor, he is the only governor I‚Äôve only heard good things about, h gives me so much hope
I live in texas and I‚Äôm VERY envious of a leader who seems to give a shit about their constituents. And, sadly, a budgetary problem probably resonates more with other legislators than a human rights issue.
The governor is providing multiple reasons why it is a bad bill. It starts with the most simple and logical reason and ends with a powerful appeal to emotion because emotion is what m drives behavior change. It's a very common and powerful rhetorical device used to sway opinion.

The end result is the reader or listener comes away from the speech with the logical reasons cemented into the argument by the emotional bond created by the ending. So the reader or listener is now on the side of the speaker emotionally and morally.
I lived in Utah for 13 years, and while the legislature is bought and paid for by the church there have been some suprisingly open governors.  Huntsman, and Cox were both better than expected.  I do feel like he has to hit point #1 you mentioned because he (and all of us know) that the only thing that might move the Utah state legislature is not humanity, but $$.  To me it shows both that he is a good person, and that he understands where the only levers he really can pull to effect any change exist.
He doesn't sound like he will support trans people BUT cares about life and with a pro life stance that he has he equate the sacrificing his beliefs for the greater good if preventing suicide with trans people using straight logic of trans people are a minority and wouldn't change much
They don't care what they're doing. They just know the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

Politicians will do any say literally anything to get/stay in office
For most the cruelty is the point. They‚Äôre desperate to have an under class they can absolutely shit on.
[removed]
Of course it was‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre trying to gather votes they haven‚Äôt yet edit: nope, they did it like last night, fuck.
This is the kind of politician that makes primaries SO important. The dream is to have a liberal governor, but many places that‚Äôs highly unlikely. If you know you‚Äôre in a red state that will very likely vote in a republican, we want more people like this rather than Abbott or his ilk.
I‚Äôm grateful he at least tried. I live in Utah, and it‚Äôs at least a little bit comforting that there are some who are accepting of me. I‚Äôve lived here all my life, there are a lot of good people here. I‚Äôd say the majority of the hate is fueled by ignorance, A lot of people here live in their own sheltered bubble, I did too for the longest time. I feel extremely lucky that I‚Äôve found a support system, even if my family isn‚Äôt the most supportive. Maybe someday things will be better, I really hope so.
My thoughts exactly.
Exactly. I‚Äôve lived in Utah my whole life. Between all the disgusted looks and hurtful jokes,  this is a nice change.
It felt like more than the minimum, especially releasing a statement like this. As political statements go, this one is pretty solidly pro trans kids. But I‚Äôm in texas, so maybe I‚Äôm just pining for some compassion here.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs being an ally at all. He‚Äôs not supporting the community. All he did was point out that trans people are human and deserve to be treated with dignity. It feels very much the same as ‚Äúhate the sin, love the sinner‚Äù.
And he seems to defer to people who DO know and seems to have tried to educate himself.
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. A politician keeping their word. *sigh*
Agility dogs should compete against cis men. 

Horses should compete against cis men. 

F1 cars should compete against cis men.
To paraphrase a great author, if you think trans women are women except when it comes to sports, you don't really think trans women are women. You just allow them to be women some of the time.
Across sports? The effect of trans athletes on sports and performance records is statistically insignificant.
>  Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. 

This is just not true. There's a handful of subcategories where trans women have a small advantage over cis women, and they don't compete enough (and likely never will) to ""shatter records across sports."" Trans women occasionally win, but that's reasonable to expect across 1000s of competitions. You are couching your transphobia in logic but it's clear you have no actual understanding of the science or statistics, you're just being transphobic. 

> It‚Äôs not fair.

This is the weirdest take because sport already is dominated by people with the right genetics and upbringing. Competitive sports is never fair, but you're targeting trans women because you are transphobic rather than finding much more significant ways to make sports fair. 

If you care about fair women's sports so much, increasing funding for research and marketing is a way better way to make it fair than banning trans women. You're not making sports fairer by banning trans kids from playing sports with their peers. Which is what this bill does.

Educate yourself: https://youtu.be/HdT1PvJDRo4
I would pay. I would buy memberships. I would print pink and blue foam (middle) fingers. I would support my trans bros while they just flex on the cis.
It shouldn‚Äôt be a ban as much as just common sense
>the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

...which is in turn mainly true because the politicians and their pundit pals have *told* them to hate trans people so the politicians can always score an easy win when their numbers are down.
Fuck off. We are not mentally ill, and we sure as Hell don‚Äôt need or deserve to be thrown in prison or *ENSLAVED* (and yes, that is exactly what you just advocated for) just because we‚Äôre trans.
It is well known among democrats in Utah that they need to be registered as republicans.  The republican primaries are closed in Utah, but the democratic primaries are not.  All of my friends that are democrats in Utah are registered republican so that they can push more liberal republicans through the primaries.
True, in my experience it's pretty rare to even meet another trans person IRL (I'm in Australia though) and I guess it's easy for transphobia to spread when there's more people who have opinions on trans people than people who actually know trans people personally. Sorry your state is treating you like shit.
Not only that, this was the second time he vetoed this bill.
Yeah, I don't see how anyone can be anti-kids and hold a position of power. But that's just me. He didn't say he supports trans kids' right to take blockers to delay puberty or anything like that. He said he doesn't want them to kill themselves. So... Yeah.
Intersex and hermaphroditic athletes present interesting edge cases. It is not all b&w.
So because it‚Äôs insignificant, in your mind that means all the girls and women who are currently losing to trans men don‚Äôt matter. Gotcha. Like always it‚Äôs always about men.. nothing truly changes.
You want to defend womens sports from a fake threat? Sure, but by definition these bulky hot men need to now play against cis women, because after all, ‚Äúit‚Äôs how you were born‚Äù that‚Äôs the most important, not years of hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery when deeming who can and can‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôd pay real money to watch this too
Who are you guys voting for? Becky Edwards is the popular choice right? At least, that's the vibe that I get. If Mike lee wins the primaries, the next favorite would be McMullin in the generals, right? (I have no one irl rn to ask these questions) I really hope we can unseat mike lee
You literally don't even understand what trans men means.

How did you get to this sub? Did you intentionally come here to be transphobic?

Obviously he was lying because he's contacting MY friends he hasn't seen or spoken to in years and is saying extremely transphobic things. He is clearly angered by what I'm doing. I just feel really defeated and like I should've known all along. I'm really thankful I moved to another state before I started because frankly I do not feel safe visiting home ever again. I would not put it past my dad to feign support to lure me home so he could do something horrible to me. 


I don't really know what to do from here other than I never want to see or speak to my dad ever again

EDIT: ah I'm overwhelmed by how much support this post is getting. Thank you all so much for your perspectives ü•∫ it helps me so much to have you guys to talk to‚ù§Ô∏è"	"Woah, sorry OP. That must hurt. :-/  
Serious wtf moment.  
But it‚Äòs kinda curious he pretends to be fine infront of you, isn‚Äòt it? Mine never did that. Maybe he does have some doubts, like he knows there is something he doesn‚Äòt get?  
Hope your friends support you and educate him. Good luck.
My dad hasn‚Äôt talked to me since my mom outed me shortly after my 21st birthday, I‚Äôm thinking of sending my dads side of the family an ultimatum on the whole thing ‚Äúif you want me in your life then genuinely try to support me, but if you don‚Äôt agree with it that much then I don‚Äôt want you in my life‚Äù type deal

This type of stuff is going to happen with us, best thing we can do is stick together through the hardships and live our happiest life being who we are
I'm so sorry honey. Your dad should be there for you, and it says everything about him that he doesn't love his children unconditionally.
Gosh. I heard that why are you mutilating yourself"" phrase from almost everyone in my family. ""You're such a pretty girl and you're not gay (I'm asexual) so why would you even change genders??"" I'm sure it comes from a place of ignorance but it sure as hell feels intentionally aggressive. I think it may be a mixture or both. If I can bully or scare my family member about it then maybe they'll change their mind- kind of thing
Hes not your dad anymore hes just a mother fucker
My ‚Äúliberal‚Äù dad threatened my college money and my health insurance if I transitioned.  He said I had joined a cult and compared me telling him I was trans to being ‚Äúas if I told him I was a Nazi.‚Äù  The final straw is as when he said he wouldn‚Äôt pay my bail if I was arrested for using a women‚Äôs bathroom.

The behavior you are describing is deeply disrespectful.  If he has a problem, he should at least show you the respect of talking about it to your face, not playing games.
I am genuinely sorry for your situation. Most of my friends know but I still haven‚Äôt told my mother (only family I have left now) yet. Not sure how it‚Äôs going to go. I hope you find a way to be at peace with it and not let it harm you. We can‚Äôt control how others view the world, we can only be ourselves.
how old are you 
are you safe
WTAF?  Outing someone to your friends is messed up.  Way to add stress to any already overwhelming situation of which he is not being supportive. Like, literally you couldn‚Äôt do much worse.
Obviously I don‚Äôt know the full story of your family dynamic but I will just add a little of my experience ‚Äî my parents were really shocked and confused when I came out but their first reaction was ‚Äúwe love you and support you‚Äù even though they didn‚Äôt really understand what it all meant. They later went through a LOT of processing and learning and finally came to really understand after about a year of going to a PFLAG group for parents of trans people.

Especially early on, my transition consumed every waking minute of my life ‚Äî I was thinking about it CONSTANTLY, going on all these subreddits, checking out trans hashtags on ig, reading books and comics and stuff‚Ä¶ I was totally immersing myself in this community before I came out to my parents, and they kind of had to catch up and do all that processing and unlearning of transphobic tropes and stuff while they were also dealing with being my parents during a vulnerable and complicated time in my life.

Not knowing what your dad said or did I don‚Äôt want to make it seem like I‚Äôm excusing him or taking his side. It is possible that he wants you to know that he supports you even if he doesn‚Äôt really understand it yet. The fact that he‚Äôs reaching out to your friends behind your back is a little odd but he could also be genuinely curious about what you‚Äôre going through and doesn‚Äôt know how to ask directly. I just wanted to share that my parents needed a ton of support and learning and space to vent their worries and ask uninformed questions, but that over time they learned and really understand now. Hope your family comes around and supports you!
""Why won't my kids contact me""
what does he mean by mutilating your not cutting your self?
great im in north east too western mass.
I just wanted to say I'm so very sorry your dad has betrayed you this way. I wish I could hug you.
Parents are definitely a huge issue for the trans community apparently more so dads. Best thing you can do is block him in anyway and cut him off and out of your life and never have to think about him again. I know thats what my plan is. I wish you luck with whatever you must face in the future.
I would confront him about it.

Since you're not physically around him, all you can risk is losing contact with him which may not be such a bad thing if it goes there. 

just like message him and say like

""Dad I know that you went behind my back to talk to my friends. And I know what you said. First of all, it really frustrates me that you would lie to my face and go behind my back to harass my friends. That's not okay. Secondly, it's really disappointing to hear (second hand, no less) that that's how you really feel about me. Thirdly, If you want to ask me genuine questions without judgements, then I'll be happy to talk to you in a friendly and understanding way. I just ask that you respect my choices and respect me as a person. Just talk to me like the adult I am (I assume if you moved away your an adult) and I'll do my best to help you understand me.""

Of course you can omit or change anything you want.

and if you want to copy anything I wrote verbatim to make it easier for you, I welcome it.
Still... He might hurt your feelings and challenges your conviction, but if you keep on going through your transition while having at least a little contact with home. Then I'm certain his doubts towards you will stop. Most partens think to themselves: why does it have to be my kid.. It an awful thought, but it usually stops when they can see you as the other gender, happy and smiling
cool hope your not in the south  there a little crazy
make your own family and be loving to your friends good luck angel
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry that happened. Your dad is horrible. The only thing is being thrown away is you and your dad's relationship now.
that sucks üôÅ sorry u had to deal with that
I'm sorry for the loss of your dad. Maybe your father will be one again when he realizes you are happier than ever.
He‚Äôs not your dad he‚Äôs a lying monster. Love yourself first. Stay safe and I wish you the best. Enjoy your journey and live your life it‚Äôs well worth it üíï
Well.. the good side is that you can try to contact said friends and y'all and play your dad. Like, planned ahead ro say things to confuse him more and more as to what you want or nor to do, since in the end it seems like he is set on being ignorant and an asshole.
You are awesome and your father is a transphobic moron. May your journey go well.
I trust my friend to back me all the way up. We've been friends since age 4 (25/26 now) and they are genderqueer and also have a trans brother. So jokes on my dad thinking he'd get them to agree or something üòÇ they are gonna call me later and tell me more this is just what I know


I can't even say I'm surprised he pretended. I'm the only kid he has left that hasn't cut off contact with him. I think he was trying to save face and was planning to eventually change my mind or something next time I visit him. But I am definitely not going to visit him again
I agree ü•∫ I'm really happy to have found this community (I'm very new to reddit) I do have some friends that are trans, but it's really nice to come here and talk to you all and feel your support ‚ù§Ô∏è


I'm thinking it's probably going to come to that with my family. I'm more than happy to explain things to them and talk it out but only if they are willing to actually listen and change their minds. I can't waste time explaining things if they are going to turn around and listen to cis people who have no idea what they're talking about instead
Yeah my dad has 3 kids and 2 of them he doesn't speak to anymore because he refuses to ever be wrong or apologize üôÑ I think his initial fake support was literally just trying to hold onto his last kid that wants anything to do with him. But I sure as shit dont feel safe around him now!
I think the term ‚Äúmutilating‚Äù has a fairly dark connotation, so while it may be from a place of ignorance I would question if anyone saying that is really looking to be supportive
Yeah it does feel aggressive. At one point he was like ""why can't you wear binders and fake beards and be a girl??"" Like. What üòÇ


I know for sure my dad watches a lot of YouTube and listens to very Republican talk radio, like he listened to Rush Limbaugh, Glenn Beck, those types. He is a mailman so usually just driving and listening to this stuff all day every day. I can tell where he's getting his info because of the specific language he suddenly picks up. What truly perplexes me is they always accuse you of joining the ""cult"" or whatever yet where are they getting their info? From cis gendered people who have never wanted to transition. I know I'm biased but like. If I want someone to bake me a cake for my birthday, I wouldn't go to someone who has never baked a cake and in fact, WANTS cakes to taste disgusting. Like?? üòÇ


It sucks so many of us have to go through this. Hugs from me to you ü´Ç
LMAO TRUE
God that's horrible! üòî I'm sorry he did that to you. My dad told me coming out was ""like hearing my child just died"" very dramatic if you ask me. I'm still here! ü§®
>as if I told him I was a Nazi

Incredibly ironic given that the nazis rounded up trans people (along with other queer people) in an attempted genocide against those who came before us.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I see you got to start transitioning finally! I hope it all goes well for you ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Yes I'm safe! ‚ù§Ô∏è I'm 25 and living in a different state than my dad does. I actually moved so I would be safe from him and the rest of my family.
Oh my friend already knew I was out as did my dad. It's just super weird for him to talk to them about me like that üò≠ I really think he thought they were gonna side with him ü•¥
I appreciate your input. A few days after coming out he called me with a ton of questions after googling some stuff. Every time I explain stuff it seems like he gets it but then he keeps coming back like ""but wait what about THIS hm???"" Recently he hadn't asked me anything. then I get a text from my friend about this today. I haven't gotten the chance to chat on the phone with my friend, but according to them he was being really transphobic and shitty and blaming left wing politics lmao it would be nice if that changes but I don't think my dad has ever changed his mind about anything in his life and isn't very empathetic.
My dad saying that in full clown makeup ü§°
I think he's been listening to transphobes who think transitioning is self mutilating. I've heard it used before. It's an especially dumb way to look at it. All I'm doing currently is just the hormones which is just a needle once a week. The hormones are naturally doing the rest, which Ive explained to him
Thank you ü•∫ü´Ç it means a lot
To be honest I spent several years before coming out mentally preparing for my dad to be the one to cut me out. Then a year before I came out, he cut out my 2 other siblings so I was all he had left üßçüèº‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èit sucks cause there is so much more to my dad that makes me and my siblings not want to associate with him, but I still feel guilty cutting him out because he always treated me like the golden child and now I'm not so golden. My desire to be myself and my desire for my dad to be proud of me are at war. I know whose going to win hands down but like. Man. Anyways sorry ik all you guys are not therapists and I'm dumping a lot ajsjss I'm honestly just blown away by the amount of support this is getting. I hope it works out well for you and I appreciate your comment ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't know...he's been physically violent in the past. Not often but I don't trust him not to be üòî I'm not sure. If I see him it won't be alone at his house anyway
Thank you ü•∫ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è also I'm in the north east in a pretty blue area. I should be alright just trying to mentally process
Man that would be really nice
omg, your friend‚Äòs gonna roast him crispy. xD   

Take all the distance you need.
The support from others is why I‚Äôm now transitioning after waiting almost three decades. For the first couple it was just not really understanding it was even an option. The last few it was just feeling too isolated, but the net and all these wonderful people I never knew were out there helped with that. (For me it was discord first) It‚Äôs why I love the ‚Äúhello beautiful little trans/gay people in my phone‚Äù memes. For me they represent a genuine feeling.
He sounds like a narcissist
I'll be glad to supply the dad jokes like I do for my sisters
Yeah gosh, I‚Äôm sorry.  See my mom, she had reservations at first, but and she and I went on a long car ride together and we worked it out.  She read some books to try to understand better.  She connected with other people with trans kids.  Now I‚Äôm‚Ä¶ just her daughter ^^

It can be wonderful or awful depending on the person.  Clearly, not so good with your dad :/
Thank you üñ§ I‚Äôm about six months in so far. Going wonderfully. I actually have emotions again. A full range of functional emotions, something I haven‚Äôt had since I was a kid. It‚Äôs amazing.
""OH NO, MY CHILD IS ON THE NEEDLE DRUGS!  ABIGAIL SHRIER TAKE THE WHEEL!""
Bringing back is always a good thing, but what i was getting at was keep on transitioning. Yet write home to your mother and other family keep them updated send them pictures and when you finally feel ready and fat enough into your transition then you come home and show them all who you truly are.... Maybe I'm just projecting my own experience since I can relate quite a lot to your story, but thinking positively is always the best solution trust me on that
He DEFINITELY is. Shows a lot of the signs and what have you
I'm happy to hear it went well with your mom! <3
That's so awesome to hear ü•∫
Oh okay I got you! My mom isn't very keen on it either so I don't think she's comfortable seeing my progress. But recently on FaceTime I held up a photo of me before so her and my aunt's could see. My aunt's say things like ""you make a cute boy"" while also using she/her and my deadname üòÖ I think they mean well but I also think they're always going to misgender me because they don't understand its a permanent change. Either way, I'm really glad I put physical distance between us. Even if people are well meaning, it's a lot for me to take
Oof he won't ever change, my dad did the same thing. Acted accepting, and now doesn't seem to care at all and rants transphobic stuff to me. You were likely never safe around him to begin with.

i fucking hate periods	"First, sorry for the language but I HATE PERIODS (ftm), they're annoying, they ALWAYS remind me I'm afab, it's a visual sign: YOU'RE BORN A WOMAN. I hate every fucking month when they start. I wish I'd never got them in the first place. I hate every single bit about them, fuck periods, fuck the ability to give birth, fuck estrogen, fuck the pain, fuck the shitty feeling and the stupid annoying ""It'S nOt EvEn ThE eNd Of ThE mOnTh"" jokes. I don't wanna hear any of this stupid shit anymore. I want them to be gone, I wanna rip that fucking shit out of my body and throw it in the bin so I never have to see it EVER again. üñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèºüñïüèº

I swear I'm on the edge of crying out of anger

Edit: Just the fact that this post got 100 upvotes says it all

Edit again: I'm trying to answer all comments so sorry if I can't answer all of you <3"	"I (ftm) just got off mine and I agree it sucks ass. Mine only last 3 days but they‚Äôre a fucking nightmare and I feel like actual literal shit the whole time. I was put on BC to take a medication last year and they lasted over a week while I was on them and I stopped taking the BC AND the medication because of it (dw I‚Äôm fine it was just accutane.) Fucking sucks that they forced me to go on BC to be able to take it in the first place.
I have PCOS, mine never ends. And I have such risks for strokes etc that I don't really feel safe about any birth control to treat it, either. 

Yeah, It sucks, but hopefully we'll get to transition eventually and be rid of periods.
I know this feeling. I'm ftm too and being reminded every month over and over again is just torture. I'm sorry for you bro, but maybe one day you won't have to suffer anymore. Idk if you want to go on t or anything but I believe that you don't have periods anymore if you do. Good luck to you <3
Hard agree! I hate it, and then all the other things that cause me dysphoria just become amplified! Just please give me a break from this bloody nightmare!
Hahah yeah. I (ftnb) honestly fucking hate it. And god am i glad i got to go on the contraceptive pill. I used to get so many terrible pains and it'd make my foot feel like it was being stabbed for some reason? Not to mention how fucking heavy it is like holy shit. Just feels like you're gonna die really.
Before my hysto my dysphoria about periods got so bad I would psychologically pretend they didn't happen. Just fucking bleed and bleed until I was forced to do something about it.

Hysterectomy was a life saver.
You‚Äôre not alone, I hate my period always have. I can‚Äôt stand it! The pain the mess the cost of supplies üòí ugh yeah periods just fucking suck!!
Wish I could take it away for myself
I understand completely. I'm on T now so I don't experience it anymore but mine were BAD. Instead of cramps, I used to experience an intense pain directly in my ovaries that was so bad I could barely stand up. If I didn't turn out trans, I'd probably still have had my ovaries/uterus removed because there is no way I would've been able to live like that
I started birth control and I wanted to get the one that stops the period all together but I fucking can't get on it and the dysphoria is killing me
Just I hate being afab I hate periods so I feel ya pain and I'm so sorry can I send you a online hug?
on my period right now and i feel you :( it fucking sucks
I certainly do understand. My wife before she passed and both her daughter and our daught have some brutal ones. I've seen what they go through and it's not pretty. As a male that definitely feels fem alot, it hurts me to see what they're enduring and not being able to do anything to help.
the pill made my periods go away completely but before I started taking it, I used a menstrual cup and period underwear and those helped with dysphoria because they hold an insane amount of blood, so I didn't have to dump the cup/change underwear nearly as often as I had to change pads if I used those. also, I couldn't feel the cup like I could feel a pad or tampon so I could forget about it easier.
Yeah I totally agree they definitely suck. Everything about them is a major dysphoria trigger. I‚Äôve only known that ive been dealing with them for a year and a half (intersex) but im already so absolutely fucking tired of them. It was so much easier when I didn‚Äôt know there was any causation but now its like I get one symptom free week if that and the rest of the time it all just sucks. It doesn‚Äôt help when that little voice pops up saying ‚Äúyou are supposed to be amab‚Äù either. Ive actually stressed myself out to the point where ive missed a couple but then when I miss one things just get worse not better. Im still looking for the opt out button. I figured out a few mental tricks that do help but they only go so far. I really just wish I could go on vacation and leave everything menstrual cycle related behind.
I know what you mean. I just had mine & it was fours days of bloody hell.
I‚Äôm a trans guy as well so I get what you mean just know that real men bleed for seven days üíØ
The amount of times I couldn't take OTC pain medication because my body would reject them and make me puke. And don't even get me started on how bad the cramps used to be before I got on a prescription for pain meds. 

I cannot wait until I get a hysterectomy, periods suck ass!!!
I'm not FTM and I don't really understand how it affects trans men, but I heard a nice thing from a guy who got pregnant recently:
""Men can get pregnant, men can get periods and I'm super proud of it"". 
Periods may be really annoying but try to work it out into thinking you're a man with periods and not that it's a reminder that ""you're a woman"", because you're not :)
If you can find a doctor who will agree to it, a Hysterectomy (removal of the uterus) will permanently end them.
Cis woman here. If you‚Äôre okay with being on a contraceptive *and* you want your periods gone, then I‚Äôd recommend a Nexplanon implant. They‚Äôll make your periods lighten and, after a year or so, for many people they stop entirely. And the implant is good for five years.
I feel you man. I fully plan on donating my uterus as soon as possible. In the mean time, if you can get on hormonal birth control, it might help. My life has been 10,000 times better since I got on it. 

Of course, I don't know how old you are, so if you're a minor there might have to be a conversation with a parent. If that's an issue, maybe just tell them how much pain and trouble you have with your period and ask if you can look into birth control to relieve it. That's a fully valid reason to get birth control. That's why my doctor recommended it to me. My periods were causing awful pain, cramps, digestive issues, and mood swings and I just thought that was normal until my doctor asked about it.
I don't know if this is comparable to boners as a mtf. Its definitely less annoying as mtf, but ftm has a lot of emotional issues with periods. I honestly think comparing is stupid, cause were all the same family but it helps me relate if i know what the differences are in terms of occurence and severity. 

As someone going through mtf Estrogen emotional issues atm, this is super interesting
Hey I just wanted to say, they will go away. Once you‚Äôre on testosterone I promise they will go away, I had a similar struggle with mine too. I noticed you play rdr so if u ever wanna play w someone hmu!
I can't imagine üò≥
I'm FTM, and I agree it sucks ass- but luckily for me I got a birth control implant and that's stopped mine for the most part. that's a suggestion maybe--idk-- something that did happen is that it went on for a few weeks over and over, but after I barely have one at all.
Non-binary afab here! I got an IUD and mine stopped after two months of having it like completely stopped! I know it doesn‚Äôt happen for everyone but most people experience less symptoms (bleeding included) after they get it.
Ever since I was put on BC pills, I‚Äôve been using them to skip my periods- with the recommendation from my gynecologist-  and I‚Äôve felt so much better
if you can, try going on birth control. i only have a period every three months (unless i forget to take one) and it‚Äôs definitely helped.
I'm not trans male but bruh I hope for the best for u
just wish i could get my uterus removed and give it to a trans woman :‚Äô(
Hard agree, periods absolutely suck.  I do menstrual suppression with the go ahead from my obgyn (taking BC pills and just skipping placebo week) and it has done wonders for my mental health.  The thing that sucks though is if I miss even one or 2 days, I wind up having a mini period.  But ig that just reminds me that it really works oof.  Periods are SO dysphoria inducing and they just suck so much.  I get it, I‚Äôm not pregnant, go away
I'm a questioning cis woman/possible ftm enby/man (i have no clue who i am rn tbh) and i fucking hear you, brother. 

I'm nearly 40, menstruating since i was 10, looking down the barrel of an early menopause and still i cannot get my head around how fucken horrible it is to bleed so much every month 

it feels like a very old argument, but if amabs had a menstrual cycle, things would be very different
i was so glad when progestin BC stopped mine, no bleeding ever as long as i take the pill daily. not on T yet, but my doc said it‚Äôs fine to take both
I‚Äôd imagine getting periods is much more dysphoric for trans men than not getting them is for trans women. I pretty much only ever notice their absence when I hear a cis woman mention them. However, at least you can get a hysterectomy.
Just started mine. It is so frustrating. Anytime someone talks about it they say ‚Äúladies‚Äù or ‚Äúwomen‚Äù, and I just want to eject myself from the planet. I hate it so much. I‚Äôm wishing you luck, brother. I‚Äôm so sorry you‚Äôre going through this right now.
Men have periods too. Non-binary people have periods too.
Same
I wouldn't like it either! I don't think any woman really likes it that much. Especially if you've identified as male it must be a real shitty experience!
Have you tried birth control?
wanna swap bodies?
I am mtf and would swap body with you without hesitation. I would like to have the period and give birth
Wanna trade? You ain't gon have a period ever again unless something disastrous happens! (mtf)
I'll gladly trade you any day of the year my random boners for your period, that way we both win
Hey dude you wanna trade, I‚Äôll take your estrogen if you want my testosterone :)
I feel lucky that I‚Äôm AMAB trans now and rather than being trans AFAB. 

(You‚Äôre lucky because you are able to cry though)
Cheers, I‚Äôll drink to that, we‚Äôll I can‚Äôt because I‚Äôm under age but it I could I‚Äôd drink to that, that was poetry. In other words I agree.
I don‚Äôt know if I want a full on hysto but I despise my periods as well and the thought of being pregnant makes me want to vomit.
same i'm on my period rn and it sucks
im on my period rn (ftm)and it‚Äôs terrible‚Ä¶ the cramps are always bad and the bleeding is overwhelming and my parents won‚Äôt let me take any medicine because it‚Äôs ‚Äúbad for me‚Äù and will ruin my ability to have kids?? idk but I usually don‚Äôt have any bottom dysphoria but my period always kicks my ass. im usually ok for the most part until my period kicks in and it‚Äôs always dreadful.
I fucking hate it too I had it over for a whole month, uterus needs to be yeetus deletus this second üò§
Hope they make the necessary transplantations possible soon, because:

You hate periods - I hate hot having them and not having the ability to get pregnant (mtf)

If the medical procedures were perfected yet I'd see a clear win win situation here
i (ftm) am coming to the end of my period. I'm so glad that it's finally getting closer to when i can start packing again. i hate mine because it's a physical sign im AFAB and because mine hurt like mfer. the kind that leaves sobbing on the bathroom floor. i live on Tylenol and a heating pad. we're manly men who can do this. if anything we're more manly then cis men for having to deal with this.
Yeah I'm on mine right now and I want to experience alivent
Can you get a uteruectomy ? Wouldn‚Äôt that stop them?
the dysphoria gets 10x worse :(
i already wanna kill myself on my period, i don‚Äôt need the dysphoria making it worse
Im sorry dude. Must really suck to get this reminder that you don't have the privilege to be born cis every month.

I hope u can solve this soon
So true. Just fucks me up mentally and reminds me of how weak i am and the limited control I have over my body. Anyway it's really nice to find another ace in the wild :)
I fucking hate em too man, mine don't hurt that much it's just I apparently need to bleed waterfalls of the damn stuff :// it's especially annoying when u been on T for several years and they keep popping up because I missed one shot or didn't take my patch for a week by accident. Then sixty days later I'm suffering üò≠ anyways good luck getting T bro
Yeah but i actually surprised myself. I thought i hated mine too and i still think that, but i have an ed and that caused me to stop my period. I panicked when i didnt have my period for 2 months:/
Just ended mine, just the sight of pads disgusts me because it‚Äôs a slap in the face.

A constant reminder that I‚Äôll never really be a guy.
Sending good thoughts your way mate
you can go on birth control non-stop and it makes menstruation stop so all of this can disappear. Periods are no longer necessary, anyone can chose to opt out of them. You can go to a gynaecologist and ask for birth control to stop periods. 

the better ones are Depo Provera, a shot done every 3 months. or Mirena IUD put in every 5 years, do not take copper IUD as that does not stop periods. Take the higher dose one so Mirena is better than Kyleena and Skyla IUD for menstrual suppression. 

There are other options like pills, Evra patches, Nuva Ring, Naxplenon, Lupron to try.

If over 40 can get endometrial ablation. Can also get a hysterectomy when over 18 (can just remove uterus, keeping ovaries so no need to go on hrt) to have periods stop permanently. 

If the period already started there are ways to lessen/stop flow and lessen/stop cramps (those are proportional for some people) with tranexamic acid. Talk to a gynaecologist or family doctor for the right dosage. It should be something like 2 500mg tablets, 3 times a day while menstruating. The blood then clots inside instead of coming out and gets absorbed back, the capillaries that are exposed from endometrium shedding don‚Äôt have as much blood come out. 

Can also go on Lupron (this is the big guns, 100% stops periods since puts you into menopause) but that one would need to be in combination with testosterone hrt to be for long time. Though there are ways to counterbalance being on Lupron. The biggest concern is bone density so one can take calcium and vitamin D. You can talk to a family doctor about it and it should be something like 1200 units/day of Vitamin D (this is double the regular dose when buying over the counter vitamin D, so that it offsets the extra need) and 500mg/day of calcium. 

A gynaecologist can also combine various methods if none of the solo methods work to regulate symptoms and make sure menstruation ceases. The way it happens is combining a local and systemic method. Like local can be IUD and systemic be Depo Provera (most birth control are systemic). Or even other hormones combined like local be IUD and systemic be Visanne. 

If this is impacting your quality of life or just to avoid hassle, it is okay to chose to opt out of periods. You don‚Äôt have to go through this just for being born with a uterus.
I‚Äôll start with saying I‚Äôm really sorry. I do get it. My ex use to call it his MANstration but it was always a hard time for him. I just loved how he put it though and I always found it to be a fun nugget. 
I found my period to be the most devastating thing and I cried for a year or two every time I got it when it first started. I had such a hard time and still do. On days where my identity is blurry it seems my period wants to show up and remind me what everyone sees. Please scream and yell!! I really hope one day you will never have to think about this problem again. Until then I wish you short periods!
And that's why I have had the mirena implant going for nearly 15 years now. It's way better than the week long agony that was my period
As a mtf this post assures me that I am not cis 100%.

&#x200B;

Dear OP, no amount of blood will change the fact that you are simply a MAN.
Gods, I feel this. I'll offer a little advice as a ftnb suffering from endometriosis, pcos, PMDD and fibroids, all of which make my periods hellish (record: 292 consecutive days of bleeding).

My doctor has assured me that depo provera or seasonique won't interfere with testosterone if you want something that'll put a stop to periods. Depo and seasonique are both injected every 3 months and as long as you schedule the shots to overlap you'll probably have no periods or extremely short/light periods once every 3 months, which is better than every month. I'm not currently on T but I asked my doctor what my options are for if I decide to start it.

Taking this has alleviated my period-related pain/mess/dysphoria a lot (not to mention saved me a ton of money in pads - having to buy them every week was exhausting and they're expensive).

I also heard that the implant can stop your period wholesale for like, five years, but I have no information on if it interacts with T.
i got on mine today and i genuinely am angry i wish i was a boy so bad, my gender dysphoria has been really bad recently and the way that my cramps make me wanna die just makes it all worse tbh. the struggle is definitely real. the cramps i‚Äôm getting are indescribably painful i literally can‚Äôt speak when i get them i start sobbing at the reason that 1. i‚Äôm fmab 2. they hurt so fucking bad.
i literally wanna kill someone else or myself when i‚Äôm on mine like it‚Äôs bad enough i feel like shit but it‚Äôs also super dysphoria inducing
Bro, I'm sorry that you are going through that horrid time. I hope that you are able to get that taken care of as soon as you are able so you can be free from that curse upon your body.
I keep telling myself that I'm just a man with periods. But inside it's just a reminder that I am not a cis guy.

Heck I wish we could all just trade hormones with somebody.
when mine stopped on T it made me so happy i can't even articulate. it gets better my dude. even though it is hard as hell sometimes it gets so much better.
if you can (not sure if you are already or not) but do you have the option of going on birth control? even if you're not sexually active, it can stop your period. it's not guaranteed by any means, but its worth a shot IMO. i'm on the nexplanon and my periods stopped immediately
I suppose the only bright side is most Cis men get wheezy at the sight of so much blood. Kinda makes us tougher than them if you think about it.
That sucks
Completely agree. It also really doesn‚Äôt help that mine is always so heavy I end up getting visible blood stains on my clothes and sheets so it‚Äôs always a constant reminder whenever I do my laundry
closeted AFAB enby here, FUCKING SAME. And when i express how pissed off i am at simply existing, my family just goes ""uR A BeAUtifUlL wOmAN nOW"" and i know they're trying to be nice but THATS THE POINT, I DONT WANNA BE A FUCKING WOMAN
My periods were so bad they almost sent me to the hospital, so I now get a jab in my arm every 12 weeks that stops them entirely!

Winning!
RIGHT!!! afab non-binary here, aldjskfbakkdjd i hate them. i mean, i hate them just from the concept of bleeding out of there for a week, but then ALL THE SANITARY PRODUCTS ARE PINK AND IN THE ""WOMENS AISLE"" WITH THE MAKEUP AND THEY ALL SAY LIKE ""GIRL POWER"" AND STUFF ON THEM-

my period is late, which has got me worried even though it's not physically possible for me to be pregnant-

i have an iron deficiency too and it's late so im gonna be screwed when it eventually starts :/
Yeah, I had the same with Ritalin when I was a child. Never gonna take that stupid shit ever again. IDC what my doctors gonna say CBD is the best way, works just fine for meüëåüèº

Yeah I just got them today, it's the first day and I feel like shit. I just wanna lay down, with a heat bottle(?) and play doom, slaughter demons, sims or rdr :D always helps best lol
Dude that must be a fucking nightmare! I can barely survive my five days, i cant imagine how it is to be constantly shedding blood every day! Props to you man, fuck periods
Yeah I deffinitley wanna go on T thanks bro
Yes I just wanna get on t already

Love your pp btw
Sounds like pain overflow. When one section of your body hurts so much, pain can overflow and some other area can hurt, if that makes sense.
But sounds fucking horrible
I'm considering it but not run maybe later in life
Yeah. I swear, it just messes with me. Not the mood swings but the constant reminder for 7 days that I'm afab just fucks with me. I just wanna go on hrt and never have to deal with it again. Honestly idgaf about voice change at work anymore, seriously. 

Also the cramps. Today I'm gonna go with my dad and bf to a concert and I'm thinking of telling him, cause we wanted to go at his, to stay at mine. It hurts so fucking bad üò´
Yes please, I'd give you every single bit of it. Also my cramps aren't that bad. It's not like heart attack cramps, like most people do, but they're noticeable. 
I once had to lay down, was going to see a doc, until it was semi over. I think I fell asleep for like an hour or something
a lot of transfems get period symptoms as a result of HRT so sadly we are not immune ahaha.
Yeah, always hated them. When I was younger (now 22) they weren't that bad but I swear I get worse cramps every time they come back c.c
Yesss, I'll take ALL hugs ü´Ç

But yeah, I asked my neurologist abt hrt and he first asked me if I wanted bc and I awkwardly responded ""noooooo????? I wanna have t"". though I gotta say, I understand him asking me if I wanna have bc cause afab reasons ya know
What about an IUD? Or is that the one you can‚Äôt use? It‚Äôs not a guarantee but it stops the period in a lot of people.
Just don't say anything like ""ik you're on your period, don't be mad"" or smth like that. Just cause it's annoying, bring them a warming bottle (?) And everythings fine‚Ä¶ more or less
What is period underwear? Yeah I'm considering using a cup, but I've read that it contains some sort a material which is toxic or smth
Sameeeeeee actually when I'm on vacation they're over‚Ä¶ when it stops they're starting again though c.c
Yeah, it's four days but the three last days are only the last weird brown slimy bits
""Only *real* men bleed for seven days, be one today. With *real man juice* "" :D 

Also happy cake day :3
Yep absolutely. When I didn't cracked my egg, I always thought ""I wish I'd be a guy so I wouldn't have this shit""‚Ä¶ here we are 5 years later :DDDD
Thanks, it really cheers me up but I swear my only wish run is sleeping the whole day away, not having to think about it c.c
I get what you're trying to say but it is also kinda rude like ""how about you just don't think like that?"" when some people have super intense dysphoria around periods especially cus the high estrogen can actually make your dysphoria in general worse during periods  cus it messes with your brain chemistry so much.
Idk about this yet. Maybe later in life. I think we have some doctors near who'd do that
Wait isn't this the thing where they inject that with a needle? I've heard about it but never really read sth abt it
I'm 22 and maybe on t soon and also, idk how BC would affect my body, cause first, I'm epileptic and I don't wanna have bigger bits or whatever. Everything but E pleaseeee xD
Dw, I find it a good conparison but I think mtfs and ftms are fucked the same way. We can go on t and everything's good. Our voice lower we get more hair etc. But as mtf ma giiiirl you can/have to get laser removal treatment, ffs, idk what the surgery is called where they shave down Adams Apple and do voice training etc. Talking everything but top or bottom surgery cause both, ftm and mtf can/have to do if that makes sence
Yesss, I'm couerently playing on ps4 is it cross play?
It's not fun trust me xD
Can you still go on t with BC? Now, ik that t will stop periods but genuine question
But I've I heard getting it will hurt really fucking bad
I didn't even knew this is a thing ngl
Yeah, thanks a lot, sounds great. I'm gonna definitely talk to my gyn!
Thanks sis or bro <3 same goes for u
Same, I wish u could trade my height and uterus to a transform. All the best to my sisters who read this <3
Ugh, yeah, I want that too, though I have to wait for like‚Ä¶ 4 weeks till I'm free for an appointment by my gyn
You could tell your closest friends about, you thinking you could be trans. Tell them to try some male names and maybe pronounce. This is literarily the best way to go, also it's never to late to transition please keep this in mind. I'm almost 22 and I only know since a year I'm trans, try new things out, try men's clothes, a new name, new pronounce, etc. Try every manly thing you can think about and see if you like it or not. If you like it, try to find a therapist there are many who also accept online appointments like my therapist

All the best to ya
Yeah but it's painful :(
Damn, wish I could help you eas your pain :')
Kinda xD but you'll get trough it somehow
No, never. Don't even wanna start it ngl
Fuck, yeah. Here. rn. BRING IT ON, I'M READY
Yessss pleaseeeee
Come to Germany, we can drink when we're 14 with parents, 16 beer and at 18 everything you want :D
Sameee, being pregnant sounds horrible honestly especially the presses is gross imo
Yeah, I'm in a concert and can't even stand, this fucking sucks. Though the beer makes it sorta better but just slightly
Same bro, I always get bottom dysphoria whilst on period‚Ä¶ also why is there no short meaning for dysphoria :D 

Anyhow I'm normally completely OK with what's going on down stairs but when I'm on my period it really sucks. My dysphoria gets so overwhelming I get dysphoric when I see transition goals guys and women‚Ä¶
FUCK YEAH, this hits the spot right away!!! Wish it too man
Same queen, I hope the same, cause it's already possible for trans guys to produce sperm with a 3D print thingy. Said my gender therapist
Same tho. Fuck me man, I'm not home rn, on a concert I wish I could do the same just playing games or drawing the day away, so it can fuck itself‚Ä¶ this mf :')
Sameeeee
Idk but I can soon start, hopefully, hrt so I probably wouldn't need that‚Ä¶ at least for now. Idk what future gonna be like
DW, I'm soon on t‚Ä¶ hopefully
I had horrible periods before my hysto, like we're talking 20 days out of the month I'd be bleeding an abnormal amount and have debilitating cramps. I was diagnosed with PCOS after my hysto, I had cysts all over my ovaries and my uterus was inflamed and scarred which explains why I was in pain a good 98% of the time.

Literally the only thing that helped the pain was THC, I swear I'd tried every OTC and even prescribed pain med but the only thing that actually gave me relief and helped was THC. It's wonderful more people are using it and CBD to ease their period cramps because it actually works.

Also, in my case using THC helped ease my dysphoria during my periods too, I have heard others say it's amplified theirs so case by case basis for that.
Omg I was like ""did you really tell some guy you like their p.... Ooooh, profile picture"" ü§£

But ya, periods sound terrible! Especially for guys. I don't know how it works, but I hope you can do something about it, and soon!!
Thanks :) but yeah, waiting for T (even the therapy appointments) is a pain.
Yeah that sounds about it, pretty sucky honestly
Holy shit
If only FTM and MTF could just wiggle their noses and swap bodies with a finger snap üòû
Unless you cycle your dose to simulate a period, definitely not. Progesterone makes me feel pretty wacky though! Same kinda skin feeling I associate with molly. Learned my lesson about taking it during the day.
*all the hugs my dude*
I'm sorry life sucks rn but I'm here if ya wanna talk
I could but never thought about it ngl
I try to pamper them as much as I can.
It's basically a pad but built into underwear. it sounds gross but it's not hard to clean. I've not heard of cups being toxic - I think mine is just silicone, so maybe it's only certain brands?
I mean, if you dont identify as female, and hate periods, there's basically no downsides to a hysterectomy. If you want SRS it's necessary, and if you don't, it's still a boon to you. If you can afford, and are sure you dont want to icubate progeny, go for it
I haven't experienced anything like that. But yeah, I don't know how it would interact with either T or epilepsy. Iirc, hormonal birth control is more progesterone than estrogen. Or maybe I have it backwards. That's a conversation with for doctor anyway. It wouldn't hurt to ask.

At any rate, if it becomes possible, maybe you can look into donating your uterus. They can do transplants now for people who want to have kids but can't due to uterine issues. It what I plan to do when it becomes possible. I feel a little better about having it, knowing that even though I don't want it I might be able give it to someone who does.
I‚Äôm playing on ps4 too, and yes it is! It‚Äôs called red dead online, basically you create your own character and play with other people.
I'm not sure--I'm only 14-
Mild cramping for two days that‚Äôs the only thing that‚Äôs guaranteed. With me the most painful part was the camera thing they put inside to take 3D images of my uterus. It‚Äôs honestly not that painful I promise.
Thanks
Wishing you luck
Why not?
So, I get the herbs and you find the witch?
Oh my gosh! AUNTIE JOHANNA COME PICK ME UP! (My aunt Johanna is German and lives in Germany).
my dysphoria during my period gets so overwhelming I can‚Äôt stand to be around anyone else. i have a younger brother who‚Äôs 13 and seeing him sometimes makes me so angry and sad. it sucks cuz he didn‚Äôt do anything but still
I wish you the best!
I use CBD for my ADHD but thanks, I'm gonna they it later today when I'm home
Naaah, I'm asexual, I don't have the ability to think that way lmaoüòÇ

Dw, I imagine you're cis or transfem but thanks for being supportive and yah periods suck balls lol
Yeah, pain in the ass lemme tell ya
Happy I never had it, hoenstly
ooh pleaseeeee, I'd be first in line god damn it
Swapping reproductive systems would be something else, but being 6‚Äô tall is growing on me. I can reach all the shelves! Bwahaha‚Ä¶
many trans women self-report period-like symptoms as a result of HRT. This is not well documented i admit but i just am saying what people in our community (and me) have experienced.
Trans women do experience PMS, including the physical, psychological, and emotional ramifications that come with it.

https://www.medicalnewstoday.com/articles/can-trans-women-get-periods#possibility
Thanks, same goes for you man, life sucks cause of period buuut it's fineeee. I'm gonna go on a festival in 3 Weeks so yeah, that makes me incredibly happy
Definitely look at accounts of the experience, especially recently post-op from other afab people.

My partner had a rough time initially, though theyre very happy they did it now. It caused longer periods at first, as well as a lot of spotting mid cycle (which is common). Their body also initially tried to reject it as foreign material so cramps off and on. And they could feel it a lot of the time for the first month or so before everything settled down.

Im not afab so idk what might trigger your dysphoria, but I just thought that might be worth mentioning as something to at least be aware of. Having said all that, everything did eventually settle down and my partner is very glad they did it. For them it wasn't a dysphoria thing though, so perhaps asking other transmascs who have had an IUD would be a good idea.

Good luck bro üòÅ
Yeah true but, just came to mind, I'm an epileptic and idk if I can even take t so if I couldn't take t idk if I could take E cause you wouldn't produce any hormones anymore.
Ik, ik, I've already played on PC 100% but just HAD to get it for Ps too, couldn't resist it :D same for doom. Just love these games
Oooh, yah, that suckss but you'll get there.
Cause of e, I don't wanna take more e I wanna have t. Although I understand that e'd be probably better idk honestly, cause I could get BC faster than t
If you can't find one I'll try to summon Satan.
I have the watered down transfem version and yeah they kinda suck. Though for me it‚Äôs a reminder that the meds are working; so it‚Äôs oddly euphoric? Wish you the best in your journey to eradicate the uterus, just be safe xP
And I must say I really appreciate you not taking offense to the original comment and mine. Trans solidarity at its finest. It‚Äôs a nice contrast to cis women who look at trans women and say things like why would you give up your privilege or you‚Äôll never know our struggle‚Ä¶.
I wanna be 6' :'( I'm only 3'5"" D:
It's real. Since starting HRT my resting heart rate cycles, on average, every 28.5 days, just like a cis woman's. And with that primarily the emotional cycle. There's nothing I do to cause it and if it wasn't measurable it could be dismissed as self validation or something else. Resting heart rate cycling with the menstrual cycle is well documented; I suspect it's the pituitary seeing an estrogen level and doing it's thing of cycling LH and FSH and possibly others.
I‚Äôve heard of this plenty, but such things may be psychosomatic.
It‚Äôd be nice to blame my occasional bitchiness and cramps on PMS, but it‚Äôs definitely just PAWS and my generally fucked body.
Ooo that sounds cool as fuck.
Your ovaries produce estrogen, not your uterus.
My player user is: Pickledawg1013
Not all birth control contains estrogen. Try talking about it with a doctor or looking up information online. Birth control is life-changing for me. I no longer get periods and it makes me less dysphoric overall. I have an implanon and there's no e in it
Sounds like a plan
I‚Äôve never heard anything like that. It‚Äôs pretty obvious to most cis women I talk too that I experience plenty of sexism and didn‚Äôt ask to be a girl anymore than they did.
WhY wOuLd yOu GiVe uP yOuR mALe pRiVeLaGe?!!?
üôÑüôÑ
How?!
Nope. Cis women who underwent uterus removals who are on HRT report the similar symptoms. There are studies about this issue. 

Former skeptic
I track my cycle with a period tracker and even though I have plenty of aches from Fibro, they definitely tend to get worse on a fairly regular basis! I‚Äôm hoping to see some studies about it soon.
Yeah,I'm so excited :D
Oh, oops :D
Whaaaaaaattttt????? I did not knewwww omg. I have to talk to my doc Lola thanks a lot
I'm on it :D
This might not be as true when the ovaries are removed. But tbh I have been experiencing some strange emotional and physical symptoms on an approximately monthly cycle. I haven‚Äôt thought twice about this until now, since around every month I have been having 1 to 3 day relapses on heroin. But when I think about it more and compare it to things other trans women report, the spontaneous extreme emotional volatility, gender dysphoria, and opioid cravings I experience every month may be more than a normal addiction cycle.

Apparently, the hypothalamus does do some cyclical stuff when your body is full of estrogen to tell your ovaries what to do, and certain tissues (like breast tissue) can respond to these instructions. Sounds far fetched, but I also wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if the scientific community is quick to dismiss anecdotal evidence of a potentially very interesting medical phenomenon when trans women are the ones providing the evidence. After all, we would probably be little more than insane clowns in the eyes of the average arrogant cishet male scientist.
Heroin or HRT? I hope you are fine
Idk what you mean. And yes, I‚Äôm doin pretty well these days."	wbv1vn	trans	1289	0.98	2022-07-30 11:08:35
I‚Äôm really scared of all the pushback we‚Äôve been getting recently	They‚Äôre banning children from playing sports and going after their parents now. What the Hell are they going to do next? There‚Äôs so much anger being thrown at us and we‚Äôre a tiny, tiny minority. However, we seem to be put under a microscope recently. Someone just asked the Supreme Court Nominee to define a ‚Äúwoman‚Äù as a kind of gotcha question which was really targeted at us. Are we at the center at everything going on right now? The conservatives are acting like it.	"We keep going. The backlash has increased because we‚Äôre winning. 

It‚Äôs like dealing with a bug infestation. Early efforts at removal can make it look like there‚Äôs been a huge growth in their numbers, when in reality you‚Äôve just flushed them out of the dark.
It shouldn't be like this, we shouldn't have to fear for our safety and our rights for being ourselves. I'm literally on edge every time I go out, we shouldn't feel like their is a target on our back.
there is a generational shift coming and the Right knows it and that terrifies them. They have been shrinking as a portion of the demographic charts for the better part of the last twenty years.

Stirring up the rabble with insane wedge issues that literally have nothing to do with them, but hurts those who cannot stand alone makes for good politics and garners votes, but it is a losing strategy long term. The tide is slowly turning against them. I know it sucks, but the best thing we can do is exist. Show the bastards that they can't force us back into the closet
This is awful, my heart goes out to the trans community. I‚Äôll keep sticking up for you and I give my total support! üíú
Every law being passed now will be challenged in the courts and eventually overturned.  Unfortunately many, many trans people are being hurt in the process.
I just wish transphobes would leave us alone.
This is ok because what they want is to silence us.  To crush our voices.  To pretend we don‚Äôt exist.  Well guess what‚Ä¶ this only serves to further publicize our existence and crack more eggs because the youth have cell phones and the internet.
Remember, they said and did all of these things to gay and lesbian couples, and it was only recently that they were allowed to marry and adopt, the latter of which is restricted to states as there is no national mandate allowing same sex couple adoption.
Show that we wont back down, and expose these monsters
We should all be scared and on alert. We're just another group of people being blamed for all the bad in the world right now. And we know where that leads people...
We are not going anywhere. The Trans community is and always has been here.
Pushback is strongest right before it is vanquished. The main transphobes? Most of them are boomers and older. They know that the young people won‚Äôt follow their plans and that scares them. They are led to their last resort before holding themselves accountable: pin the blame on a single group of people and try their best to convince everyone that said group of people is the enemy. But more and more people know that what the right is saying is bullshit. The boomers will die and so will this hate. We are not the enemy
Im so tired of this
I believe this too shall pass. We just need to hang in there and fight for our rights
It's just the argument from ick. Small-minded, lack of imagination, scared as hell people who aren't willing to see that there's more to the world than what they learn in sunday school. 

On the plus side, there are polls coming out all the time that even the most conservative groups in the US are more and more against discrimination against LBGTQ people. I don't have a link handy, but I was hearing about it on one of my podcasts this morning. So that's something. The conservatives in the US aren't really a majority -- they rigged the system to keep power. They will probably not kep it forever, unless there's really a Nation of Gilead in our future, but I don't really think that will happen.

I don't know when the pendulum is going to swing, but I hold out reasonable hope that it's going to be soon(ish).
For real! Everytime I read the news or see some transphobic thread on Twitter I just want to crawl  back into the closet. It's unbelievable the shit that's happening and the backlash (sometimes violent backlash) people get for just being themselves. Hopefully, the stuff that's happening just a speed bump on the road to trans acceptance.
I guess it's international tho.

 Hence, I live in Argentina, while our laws are quite advance in terms of equality regarding the lgbt+ community, people are as open minded as a rock sometimes. Christianity plays a huge part ,*shockingly*.

Thing is, we have a congress woman, frankly our system is FILLED with dangerously inadequate/dangerously uneducated people, and this woman (her name is Amalia Granata in case you want to check the levels of ignorance we're dealing with rn) just basically said trans people get paid and housing...bc they're trans.

And people being massively ignorant, and honestly just resentful towards us, bought it.

So...yeah. the far right is always doing the best they can to ensure we have a shit life. Or to ensure we don't get to live at all. Thankfully some people are aware of trans' lives issues here but sadly it's not the majority. 

And people are just looking for someone to put the blame on, or just hate.
I had a talk with my girlfriend about this recently... she told me not to focus on it and maybe just look at it localy. I still cant decide if she was rude or nice. She didnt seem to grasp why this was affecting me :/
Conservatives are little babies who have to invent boogeymen (boogeypeople) for themselves to be scared of so they can push their fascism
Remember that for all the push of the ultra right states other more civil states are swinging back the other way. The Illinois T.E.X.A.S Act was passed as a middle finger to all the states that are currently violating human rights.

It specifically lays the ground work for out of state care for anyone seeking it for services normally covered by planned parenthood. Abortions being a big one. It is designed to protect anonymity for those who need care but fear retribution.
I understand you op. It really upsets me a lot but tbh these people exist in groups. meaning where one transphobes gets on a soapbox, theyre doing it in front of a crowd of other transphobes. Most everyone hearing them just blindly agree with them so it feels like there is a lot more than there actually is.
Yes.  

Me too. 

I didn't realize it would get this bad. 

I thought it would be like the gay panic in the 90's but I guess back then states made gay sex criminal too so it's not that different.  

But if we stop now we win.  Can't let them win.
I know that it is going to get a lot worse.
All of the Southern States in the US are doing it, maybe it would spread up North.
Being in a Catholic school we already face backlash for being anything but we were born as: straight, cisgender, and religious.
The fact I am in a Catholic school is making me dislike the religion the more my parents, teachers, and students talk about how being trans is against the religion.  I hate it here, but I will never hate myself.
If the bill spreads into the Northern US, I guarantee my school would out every kid to their parents about what the students have said about their identity.  I bet that goes for other schools..
Google ""I don't bash back I shoot first"" ü§å
Naw, we will be fine. I'm not saying that we won't go through tough times as a group, but I know that we have made incredible progress in just the past decade alone. We keep fighting with our allies, we continue to educate people, and we will continue to make progress. Please, I know it can seem really dire at times... but we will prevail.
Honestly the mods for this sub Reddit should have a post pinned with how to register to vote. It‚Äôs so important to register because if you don‚Äôt vote then your voice can‚Äôt be heard. When you vote you can help change the future and make this a safer world for all of us
If i would have transphobic kids, i would cut access to the internet or something similar.
I live in Utah, and had a small glimmer of hope, our Gov. vetoed the trans sports ban, but unfortunately on Friday the legislature overturned the veto. ONLY 4 trans kids in Utah that play competitive sports and only 1 was FTM. The governor had a nice letter explaining why if you want to read it. But gendercritical ideologies are killing kids of all types.
Maybe I'm a little rash in my thoughts but my vote is that we get guns and do what the 2nd Amendment was created for, because these bills are unconstitutional as fuck
Being black I've never seen more transphboia in the black community than what I'm seeing now, but I know it's because we are more VISIBLE AND EMPOWERED than ever. Keep fighting til we take all these gd seats
There's five steps to progress.

First they ignore you.

Then they laugh at you.

Then they fight you.

Then you win.

Then they pretend nothing ever happened.

Were in step 3 currently, and step 4 is closer than you think.
We're going to win in the end.

And we're going to remember how it felt to be targeted, and we're going to fight for the rights for the next marginalised group. 

And we'll win again.

And one day, we'll all look back and weep that there was ever such a thing as bigotry. 

In the meantime, stand strong, help where you can, take time for yourself and keep on living.
Step back, live your life and let people be people.  Some might suprise you, some won't.  Nobody has a monopoly on kindness or the lack therof.
They're pushing back so hard because now there's a Democrat in office, and they're worried. They didn't need to push that hard when Trump was president, so now they're pushing as hard as they can.
First they ignore you, then they laugh at you, then they fight you, then you win.

Of course, if you give up then you're never going to win.
Yes, we are. Everything about us is a wedge issue. It‚Äôs fuc*ing war on wombs, LGBTQ. The 1% has lost their minds.
It's the same story we've seen over and over again. When those fighting against racial segregation started to win, the right-wing threw everything they could at stopping it and demonizing black people. When women started to gain rights the right-wing threw everything they could at stopping it and demonizing women who wanted more than motherhood. When gay men and lesbians started to gain rights and public acceptance the right-wing threw everything they could at stopping it and demonizing the gay community. Now trans people are starting to gain rights. In many states we now have legal protections from discrimination, over 70% of th US population supports these protections, many states are removing anti-trans laws they've had on the books for a while. We are gaining our rights and public acceptance. The rightwing is in panic mode, trying to throw everything they can at us and hoping to stop us. They're scared because we're winning, so they're trying to demonize us.
societal growing pains. I know it is bad in general but so many years ago it would of been the gays... so many years before that it would of been intercial couples.. so many years before that it would of been the blacks... yeah.. it is okay to be scared but lets reconize this may be a nessary step.
Awes,
Its dusgustung.
Don't quit cuz others make you feel bad. Quit if you want to but not because others made the choice for you.
Fuck gerontocracy
I'm doing something by going to my town hall on trans visibility day this Thursday in my small town of renfrew ontario and waving my trans flag and ignore transphobic insults along the way. Transphobic town people are going to hate me but they need to understand we are real people and we will not be silenced.im tired of being silenced.it ends now
It‚Äôs scary üò≠ I just wanna live my life and people want to dedicate their lives to tearing us down :(
The conservatives are ramped up because they aren't in the white house.  I feel like whichever side isn't 'commander in cheif' pulls out all the stops.  So we become a political game in the process.
I hate it. I HATE IT. I go to a PUBLIC MIDDLE SCHOOL, and only the people that either used to joke about my ‚Äúmanliness‚Äù before I became trans or the people I‚Äôm friends with use my new he/him pronouns. My cousins aren‚Äôt homo/transphobic, but they hate the LGBTQIA community. They think they‚Äôre annoying and stuck up, when in reality, we just NEED TO BE HEARD. I always get comments like ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not a man.‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you have one? (As in boy private part) No? Then you‚Äôre not a boy.‚Äù I. HATE. IT. I‚ÄôM SO SICK AND TIRED OF EVERYONE THINKING IT‚ÄôS A JOKE. I‚Äôm very lucky to have a family that supports me that KNOWS who I am and KNOWS exactly what I WANT to be. I‚Äôve just achieved what I want to be. But nobody respects that! It‚Äôs either boys or girls. No trans. No non binary. The only way to be trans and be accepted is to tell them your current gender and hide your past. 12 year olds are absolute inconsiderate dumbasses. You‚Äôre one of them or you‚Äôre left behind. And I WANT to be one of the boys. I WANT to. SOME of them know I AM ONE OF THEM. But they STILL THINK I‚ÄôM JUST IN THE WRONG PLACE. LIKE I‚ÄôM NOT MEANT TO BE THERE. But I AM! WE NEED MORE PUBLIC RECOGNITION AND SUPPORT. It HURTS going to school. I CAN‚ÄôT LOOK IN THE MIRROR WITHOUT HAVING ANXIETY BECAUSE ONLY, WHAT, 7 PEOPLE SUPPORT ME.
Clearly they want to fuck us in every sense of the word
I'm just saying, daggers fit pretty well into boots
And what sucks is that 80% of the kids at my school AGREE with them.



And they say WE indoctrinate kids
I am trans, and I am conservative. Everyone has their civil liberties,  and if they are taken that is worth fighting for. 
I find their are other conservatives out there that will defend the rights of all as well, all the way up to the supreme court. We've got this!
To me it is the Devil.  It chaos, Law took Church from many places.  Now, chaos is winning, they still want to complain.  God or the Devil will be jealous, you have to pick one.

I have made my peace with it.

People will hate no matter your choice.  Hate for breaking Bible Law, or Hate for supporting Bible Law with out compassion, or Love of Life.

You can't resolve but only resolve your choice and be happy.
[removed]
I‚Äôve noticed this too. The pushback really frightens me because I feel like things can get much worse before they get better. In the long run, I believe the Right will fail (and fall!), but meanwhile‚Ä¶too much anger out there. And yeah, it‚Äôs aimed at us.
We are the new Muslims/ gays/ Jews, the right wing always does this, they pick a demographic they think they can rile everyone up against and play on it for popularity and power, usualy trying to both paint that demographic as inferior and at the same time some how powerful and dangerous. 

All of this is unfortunately nothing new.
This is all a product of Trumpism. It didn't start there, but he made it okay to hate openly. Then when he got voted out it seemed like things were gonna kinda improve and even some top Republicans started to settle down, then Jan 6th happened and now literally all the Republicans are going balls to the wall over the top trying to handmaids tale the USA. Writing laws that are going to make it impossible for any non republican to win an election for the foreseeable future, and going full draconian conservatism.

The problem is that these people don't get it. They see us wanting fair treatment and representation as a personal attack on them because their identities are immutably tied to their faith, and most faith leaders of today are preaching even more hardcore versions of ""anyone not exactly like you is an outsider, and we destroy outsiders."" It's almost like there's a mainstream push toward Westboroism.

The ONLY way this ends well for us is to speak up. Speak out. And do so without malice. Call your reps, align yourselves with activist groups. As much as I hate to say it because I'm guilty of it, we need to get off our collective sexy asses and do something that counts instead of just hanging around reddit and worrying. We've got to face the facts that we don't have a Harvey Milk yet. We have a couple celebrity trans folks, but they're just speaking up. No one is really fighting for us the way other marginalized groups have had champions.

The Republicans are winning, and because no one has the stones to get involved, the entire LGBT community and many minority and poc communities are going to suffer horribly. These people aren't hiding their agendas anymore. Seriously do a little research into the bills that are being created and you'll see just how terrifying it really all is. And because dems have such a weak hold and two turncoats in their midst, doing anything about it would be career suicide for them.
big hug to everyone here, especially those in the states affected. it's rough living in this world and you all deserve lots of love. ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
we're kicking ass and we aren't gonna stop
Shit like this is what ultimately lead to me taking the plunge and transitioning.   I saw the stuff in Texas dealing with abortion rights and figured it'd only be a matter of time til planned parenthood got taken out, then right on que it was on to trans kids.  I'm not so sure planned parenthood will exist or if transitioning will be an option for people in a few elections at the rate things are going, and it seems like anyone who could do something about it won't. I still remember when politicians were hesitant to endorse same sex marriage before it was made legal
As America becomes more liberal and ethnically diverse, Republicans need to do something to get votes. Gerrymandering and voter purges aren't big enough cheats for them to stay in power anymore, they need something more.

Since they've been targeting immigrants, racial and religious minorities for decades that is old hat. To inspire their base into fearing enough to go vote we were chosen since we are weak in political power and relatively new and unknown to the public. It doesn't hurt that some religious sects have declared us to be moral abominations too.

Not that this justifies it or makes it better for us, but hopefully the context of they are losing power and using us as a tool to prevent their inevitable collapse can give you a little hope. Things will get worse depending on where you live, but in the moderate future things will likely be better than ever before.
*me not living in America* It sucks what's going on in America, in my country, our fucking leader said, hey, we can't have us poor minority Christians to be discriminated against, so now we can say anything we fucking want to anyone, and just for fun, you can be expelled for being trans. Thank God that didn't pass, thank God his term is almost over.

Honestly, just give up, if we aren't making progress in an age where everyone in western society can have a voice on social media and such, and where if people are doing shit things to you, you can call them our and hope they get kicked out of their position of power, but no. We're still here, laughed at and ignored. Keep your head down, don't make it worse
It's the last, desperate roll of the dice from people who're scared because they've realised that the world they were allowed to think they lived in doesn't and never did exist.  

The world is getting better, massively so, and quickly too. This isn't the start of a roll-back, it's a shrinking pocket of stupidity loudly imploding. We're on the right side of history, and they aren't.
This. I'm 50 years old. I spent decades growing up wondering wtf happened? It was like we had the FUCK YEAH 60s and everything kind of slid backwards since. It wasn't until we got connected over the internet that I FINALLY began seeing increasing widespread public pushback against bigotry in my lifetime. And it wasn't until then that the right wing began whining. They are gonna kick and scream all the way out as would any vestigial thing on the verge of extinction. But you can go ahead and wave bye bye, its a done deal. Evolution happens no matter which side of the curve you choose to exist on.
This.  We are going to take some blows, we might even find ourselves in a temporarily worse position than before, but there is no *ignoring* us now.
This. If we weren‚Äôt succeeding they wouldn‚Äôt be trying such last ditch bullshit. Whenever you feel discouraged look at the end of the civil rights movement. We‚Äôre winning. They‚Äôre just desperate to convince everyone ESPECIALLY US that we‚Äôre not. As long as we hang in there and don‚Äôt give up, we‚Äôll get a future where we‚Äôre at least tolerated if not accepted. That‚Äôs a start.
You're winning in US, but the backlash from there extends to other countries where it only gets worse I'm afraid.
Conservatives are very much like roaches. They will try to devour everything they can and crap on everything else.
Yeah! We have to stay strong, now more than ever!
a cornered rat is louder and more likely to attack..
I know..stay strong! We can do it together!
Fight forever.
The problem is that I see other 30s millenials adopting this harmful mindset. The only people I have seen take a more leftist mindset that are similar to me in age are my husband, myself, and people online.
This is the best comment. Thank you.
""get that rock, of my map""

ty!
until then we're all dead due to global warming
That‚Äôs exactly what they want us to do.  But we need to stay strong and not cower under their hatred.
You know what, I am going to do that too.
I'm turning 40 this year and I thought during the 90s we were going in a generally good direction - there were active efforts in my little Midwestern public school to teach about the history of racism and the ongoing efforts to alleviate it. Same with climate change. Sexuality and gender weren't there yet (much to the dismay of my trans self), but I don't think it was far off.

Then I think Bush took the election from Gore and 9/11 caused a *huge* wound that a lot of people didn't heal right from.
You should read Goliath by Matt Stoller. Although it is mainly about corporate consolidation and its threat to democracy, you'll likely see how that generation directly caused so many of the civil rights issues today regardless of what they fought for when they were being drafted back then.
Just keep in mind, we've been 'not ignored' before. All the rainbow was sent to camps along with the followers of Abraham, Issac and Jacob.  


the pink triangle? yeah, that's what lesbians were forced to wear instead of the overlapped yellow one making a star.
True they do say if you ain't got haters your not winning?
I‚Äôm in Canada personally.
its like democracy: you cannot ever take it for granted.
but also consider that social media, while noisy, does not represent the whole of society, just the loudest and most insane :P

Keep pushing back
Lol üíú
You can do it my friend and ignore the insults thrown around you for doing it.we are stronger and even if I'm not where you trans people live I'm always beside you all the time.us trans people have to stick together.heres a friendly virtual hug and kiss for all of you for being so strong üòòü§óüíú
I'm literally trying to get that put into my school, the only education we got was from an outdated website with a teacher who had no idea what he was talking about, we spent 20 minutes on it before moving on
I wish I could say that it's drastically improving, but I didn't start having teachers ask about pronouns until just last year, 2021. Aside from that, there has been virtually no mention of trans people or people of sexual minorities. So even though I'd say I'm probably less likely to be bullied for my identity, there is still no (formalized) education surrounding it.
What generation?
üíØ
Those aholes you see online is what my entire state is.
Keep working at it - I was too afraid when I was a kid, but it needs doing.
Not sure if you qualify as a boomer or not, but the older boomers who were old enough to be politically active in the late 60s and early 70s is really the prime range of that.
I'm sorry, love :(
Anyone who tells you the 60s are to blame for the civil rights problems we have today is raging, either a raging right wing asshole or a raging lunatic. And I'll do the math for you, I was not alive in the 60s nor politically active in the 70s.
Oh, apparently I edited it out of my original comment, but I intended to mention it being before your time. Rather you are the same generation or not is irrelevant."	tpvi20	trans	1231	0.98	2022-03-27 23:00:46
Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up üíú
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn‚Äôt have to be your blood!
Exactly what I‚Äôm a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through all that. I don‚Äôt know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you‚Äôve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn‚Äôt have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don‚Äôt have cell service. 

It‚Äôs hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you‚Äôre okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ‚òπÔ∏è but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well üòä stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents ‚Äúloved‚Äù the latter.
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ‚ù§Ô∏è
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter‚Ä¶ I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them‚Ä¶ right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don‚Äôt deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case‚Ä¶

Take what you‚Äôve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened‚Ä¶ get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story.

I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some üíï
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It‚Äôs been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I‚Äôm so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I‚Äôm worse off financially, too, but I‚Äôve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I‚Äôm very proud of you üíúüëç
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I‚Äôm not sure where you are located but I‚Äôm pretty sure if you‚Äôre 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I‚Äôm not saying press charges or anything either, that‚Äôs something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I‚Äôm glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I‚Äôm so sorry for youüò≠üò≠üò≠

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourselfüíú, for how you‚Äôre dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with ‚Äúthose rascals, I‚Äôm not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I‚Äôm not happy with what they‚Äôve done‚Äù. Ik it‚Äôs family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can‚Äôt withhold someone‚Äôs medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn‚Äôt be brushed off. I‚Äôm guilty of doing this as well with the whole ‚Äúone more thing, that‚Äôll be my breaking point‚Äù but then things calm down and the next thing doesn‚Äôt quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn‚Äôt be split up and sent to equally abusive ‚Äúfathers‚Äù ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there‚Äôs nuance but op if there isn‚Äôt anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice‚Ä¶

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1210	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51
Transphobe got fired at my work!!	When I came out in Nov a guy I work with and sit next to exploded on me and yelled at me when I asked him to use my pronouns.  I felt so betrayed because ive known him for 2 years and we were good friends, we even used to play rust together and have gone to the dispensary with one another. Hes yelled at my 2 other times for things that arent even my job.  Today he got fired after he left early out of anger.  The yelling at me probably didnt help his case.  I am so happy as I write this knowing I can go to work with alot less anxiety.  Idk just wanted to share this w everyone as I bask in the dubüíõ	"Amazing. Rather than just accept his friend for who they are he would rather let his anger ruin his career. Transphobes really do be wildin.
Same experience.  Someone threw a hissy fit about using pronouns and alluded to their being a way to tell biologically.  They got fired.  Seriously, what‚Äôs wrong with people that shit like this bothers them so much they are willing to get fired over it.  Something must be horribly wrong with them to make themselves feel better by taking it out on other people.
Opposite experience. Old guy works the front security check. It's next to the bathrooms. Saw me step in, turn around step out and wait a bit (I won't use the public women restrooms if their are young kids in it, kind of a c my a situation.) After I finally can do what I needed to do. He informs me that he has the key to the back rooms and the restroom that is connected there for the other side of the stores clients (auto bay has their own restroom) if I ever need it
i hope you have a wonderful day when you next go to work, and every day until then : )
That sucks, I'm sorry you were let down by a friend like that. I'm glad it worked out in the end, but it's always hard having your trust betrayed like that!
Unvelievable
The good ending.
Sometimes things do turn out right
I'm glad you'll have less stress to deal with. And fuck that guy in particular! How can people be like that??

Yea I just don't understand why people can't just shut their trap and work, that's the reason we are there right? Lotta pride and ego from some people I guess
Yea I don't understand why you would risk getting fired just so you can make someone feel worse about themselves.  I'm glad he got fired queen
good guy steve the security guard!
The good ending would be them accepting OP.
Lol what? I don't close my eyes and hope people get fired? You don't understand my post.  He was already on his last legs at the company for other things like being unprofessional to MCs, trainees and leaving in the middle of the day out of anger all while demanding a raise at the same time.  No one has trouble adjusting to my pronouns, it was just him.  I don't wish him any ill will, I am just happy I don't have to work in a hostile environment anymore
Did you not read what I wrote? I'm happy because I can go to work now without feeling like I am constantly walking on eggshells.  Not like I want terrible things to happen to him; I wish him the best in his endeavors. Im just hyped I don't have to work in a hostile work environment anymore
I see what you did there and it's not clever. You think you're clever but you're wasting your life being miserable. Try and be better.
You‚Äôre right. But transphobes suffering consequences is pretty good!
[removed]
Well this isn't his first write up lol, he has been written up for being unprofessional with MC's, trainees and threatening to quit after he left in the middle of a day while demanding a raise at the same time.  This was just the straw that broke the camels back.  I think your opinion is dumb
They chose their reaction and probably did much more. Respect in the workplace is more important than that man's sole source of income
This person's dignity is more important than the dude's pride. Full stop. His actions had consequences.
Buddy. The irony in your comment. 

Respecting someone's name and pronouns it's the minimum for professionalism.
OP never intruded on the dude, just informed of what are his name and pronouns, dude screamed at OP for practically no reason, HR did its job, that dude fucked around and found out, aaand the reason he got fired was because he left without warning due to anger issues, not because OP reported him.
Obviously the guy who violated workplace equality didn't care enough about his own income to shut his mouth and get over himself.

Nobody's income or status is a valid reason to create a toxic workplace.
It's incredibly easy to respect a person's pronouns.
I mean discrimination isn‚Äôt exactly legal so that‚Äôs on him.

Also considering the trans suicide rate I think something that you just see as simple pronouns can be a matter of life or death so.
I think you get to chose what you say and what you do and they chose to be a cunt like you. Actions have consequences."	s38xtx	trans	886	0.99	2022-01-13 20:32:57
We have to be visible. We are not ashamed of who we are.	"For transgender day of visibility we want to recognize how far our community has come as a whole. We live in a society where our rights are attacked for not being understood. Where our family and friends reject us for who we are. Where we must do what we can to fit in, in a society that would exile and attack us for being who we are.

We want to remind everyone that we are stronger and more plentiful when unified than those who would oppress us and tear us down. Our rights **are** human rights, lest we forget that access to healthcare, the right to self identity, and the right to exist as you are, are rights that everyone should have access to. We are  just as diverse, just as fallible, just as **human**, as any other group of people that exist.

There are those who would fearmonger, who would tell us to hide who we are from fascism, they are the same people who would tear us down in the first place. We must stand strong as a group, hold true to ourselves, and live our lives as who we are. Though we must keep in mind that there are those of us that are in places where they can‚Äôt be themselves, where their life would be in danger just to express who they are, we must be strong for them.

There has been a rapid rise in hate recently, as people spew nonsensical rhetoric to tear down trans people. That can be scary to see, especially if you live in places that are actively passing laws to attack our lives. We must make our voices heard, our unrest, our fear, our anger, we cannot go down silently.

To those of you who come to our subreddit seeking refuge, seeking a place to be yourself, you have found it. To those of you who are here to bring others down, to gatekeep, to tell others how they should feel, we ask that you leave now as you do not belong here.

# From our team members

## bleeding-paryl

Personally, as someone who has been in this community for a bit over 10 years now, I think I can honestly say that this is both the scariest time to live in parts of the world for trans folk, but also the best time in recent memory to actively be yourself. I‚Äôve seen so much positivity in this community, and I‚Äôm always inspired by the things I see here. We will celebrate who we are, we will live as who we are, and despite things like the recent shooting, we will continue to love ourselves.

I‚Äôve noticed a rather recent and rapid uptick in people coming here who are not trans. For those that come as allies, and are here to support us, thank you. For those who are here expecting us to apologize for a murderer, or who think we‚Äôre not upset ‚Äúenough‚Äù at the murder of children, I would like you to first look inward, and ask yourself why you‚Äôre more upset at us than you are about the people murdered. We are grieving, we are hurt, we are afraid. We can feel multiple things at the same time, and we can acknowledge when things will shine an incorrect light on a community of people just as diverse as the cisgender community.

For those of you who see that kind of hate making its way through, first of all I would like to apologize, as I know we‚Äôre imperfect. I would also like to personally thank you for remaining vigilant and reporting it as you see it. Keep in mind, we‚Äôre _very_ busy, we have regular lives on top of the stuff we do for this community, and we may not see something right away, so I am always appreciative of those who can help.

## TallGeminiGirl

Firstly I would like to thank all of you for your help in reporting bad actors and doing your part to keep r/trans a safe space for all things transgender. We really can not do it with out you all. We, as a mod team, are just a small part of the incredibly diverse and wonderful trans community we represent. You, the users, are the real body, soul, and voice of our community. Thank you for being the wonderful people you are. 

I want to take a moment and share some personal thoughts on recent events. We can not let this stop us. We can not let this push us down and go back into hiding. Those of us who can do so safely need to continue making our voices heard and push back against this wave of hate. This is not a call for violence and I will never, ever advocate for such or defend such actions. Today is our chance to reclaim the current narrative around us. Be visible, be kind, and show the world who we really are and what we stand for. The small actions of a million individuals can easily over power the heinous actions of a single, evil, individual.

And don't be afraid to ask for support and comforting. Talk to your trans friends. Be real with your cis allies. It's high time they really get to know what we are going through and what we are up against. Don't feel like you have to answer for the entire community either. Your own personal needs and mental health is just as if not more important than the needs of our community. 

Stay strong everyone. The seas ahead will be harsh and choppy, but together we can brave the storm and come out stronger on the other side.

## The_Decoy

I am very thankful to have found so much support in these spaces. As someone who came to understand this side of myself much later in life, I find so much inspiration seeing how the community comes together to reinforce each other. These are obviously difficult times with our community being set upon by some incredibly vitriolic bad actors. But we are working our hardest to keep this space clear so the community can continue supporting one another. I am proud to work alongside such a wonderful and dedicated mod team. I am delighted to see how the community places such an emphasis on being respectful and inclusive to each other. Ultimately though we are pursuing our ability to live our best lives. This struggle will not be easy but will be incredibly satisfying once we have attained such an environment. I look forward to pushing for progress alongside such incredible people.

Fact darling, the truth has to be said...
I think there are always gonna be different ideologies when it comes to the community. I think for those of us that pass don‚Äôt want to be connected to the community. We just wanna get our SRS and be done. We had no confusion on who we are. We move on and live our lives in the gender we identified with. Live successful happy lives.

Then there are those that have the community to support and shelter them while they are still discovering their paths. Community is a necessary and important part of their lives. Having that connection often helps them figure out the levels of dysphoria and if they even have it at all. Its all positive. 

I don‚Äôt believe its necessary for all Transfolks to blow up their spot if they don‚Äôt feel like wearing the trans label on their sleeves. There are different experiences and lives many of us live and for those that live CIS gendered lives its part of our success in avoiding the Transcommunity that gives us additional privileges in living a solid life.

Husband wants to watch a movie about conversion therapy! what do I do???	"We watch movies together at night, in bed, before we fall asleep.  He considers himself supportive, after all, he married me.  But, he gets very sensitive if I don't want to watch a movie with him.  He wants to watch some movie where someone is forced into conversion therapy.  I want nothing to do with that subject!  I'm a Christian trans girl.  So, it's not that I'm against my loving God (who gets maligned by those people.). It's that I'm against them using my religion against me.  
How do I tell him no without hurting or angering him?  He is supportive, but naive to what dysphoria really is about.
HELP!!!   ADVICE!!!  FAST!!!  IT'S HAPPENING TONIGHT!!!

Edit:. THANK YOU all so much for your support!  It was a happy ending, at least for last night... :)"	"Just be open and tell him how you feel, if he really does loves you he'll understand
I‚Äôd just say that you really don‚Äôt want to watch the movie because conversion therapy has been used against transgender people for so long and it‚Äôs a terrible thing to go through,  hell I‚Äôm scared  that some states will try to mandate it for transgender people in the US at this point, hits a little too close to home. Then try to suggest a different movie or say if he wants to watch it that‚Äôs fine but you won‚Äôt watch it with him.
Bruh

That's so tone deaf lmao

""wouldn't it be awesome to see a movie about how society hates you""

At least it's not the ""what's a woman"" thing j/
I think you should just tell him how you feel. It‚Äôs fair to feel left out if you can‚Äôt watch movies together but if it hurts you then he‚Äôll understand. If he doesn‚Äôt then go onto explain why it could be triggering or unfair to make you watch smth like that as your perspective is a bit differentt (assuming he‚Äôs cisgender or has different trans experiences if he‚Äôs not)
Tell him it‚Äôs triggering. Suggest a different movie that shows a trans woman‚Äôs perspective.

If he doubles down, ask why he wants to find entertainment in trans people‚Äôs pain. 

There are other ways to learn about dysphoria and the hatred that‚Äôs trans people experience- documentaries and movies made by/for trans people are a better way to learn how to be an advocate.
Let him know your feelings. Also which film? There is actually an awesome queer film on this subject ""but I'm a cheerleader""
Say no. If he is hurt or angry you can handle that. But just say no.
This is terrible! I'm a transfeminine enby and Christian and I'd be hurt badly if my fiance wanted to watch a movie about conversion therapy. I'd put my foot down and refuse to watch the movie. Suggest something else, like a movie that is positive about queer and trans people.
If the movie he's talking about is ""Boy Erased"" it's not painting conversion therapy in a good light at all. ""Pray Away"" is also a documentary depicting the harm it does. So if it's either of those I don't think he has an agenda with it.
If you said exactly what you posted, I‚Äôd think he has to hear that (he already knows that you‚Äôre trans I‚Äôm assuming).

I‚Äôm a big movie person, I got mad at my husband once for not wanting to watch horror with me - I pushed him once and he had a full panic attack. I felt awful. That was the last thing I wanted. I‚Äôm sure your husband would not want to hurt you either. It‚Äôs okay to take ‚Äúno‚Äù for an answer sometimes.
Please update us on how you're doing. 

I think it's too late for my advice, all I can say now is to take care of you, try to communicate your feelings and dont let him gaslight you if he tries
I'd say be honest, let him know that that topic makes you uncomfortable, and if he is trying to learn more about LGBTQ+ issues, offer other more informative sources of information.
Maybe too late to help.  I see red flags all over the place.  Male toxicity.  Forced conversion therapy.  Christianity.  Hon, those movies are his vision for your future.  I'd run.  Fast.  But I'll assume you're not ready for that.  So tell him in no uncertain terms that those programs are off limits.  Anytime.  A line in the sand.  He needs to accept and support you unconditionally.  If he can't do that, you are in for a rough time.  Trust me.  I went thru a similar situation with my ex many years ago.  The worst 3 years of my life.  Best of luck to you.
I get it on another level. I‚Äôm black and I think I‚Äôve seen as many slavery movies as I‚Äôll ever need to. Watching people you identify with being mistreated/abused/murdered can be traumatizing. Might not be an enjoyable use of a Wednesday.
Out of curiosity, which movie?
What movie is it? There are several queer movies that involve conversation therapy as their main driving force (The Miseducation of Cameron Post, Boy Erased, But I'm a Cheerleader) but aren't pro-conversion therapy and there are several documentaries about the problems with conversion therapy. If it's a queer movie about conversion therapy, tell him you don't really want to watch it and you'd like to watch something a little less stressful. If it's pro-conversion therapy, throw the whole man out because that's a serious problem
is the movie, but I'm a cheerleader?
Is it ""But I'm a cheerleader""? Then its a pretty good movie
Say you're uncomfortable- if he keeps going he's just a bad husband
Don't care who downvotes me, the Christian God is not a loving God. If you believe that your God is loving then you've been successfully brainwashed by the church.
It's just decency to not force watching a movie that contains traumatic scenes on someone who has experienced or has deep internal issues with such trauma.  My spouse suffered a miscarriage in her first pregnancy, I felt really horrible when we went to see Up.  While she enjoyed the movie as a whole, she will not watch the opening scene.
Agnostic here an unknown compelling force is all I believe. If you are having petty issues over watching a conversion movie is a red flag to more trouble ahead judt tell him how you feel about it if he insist I would move on that is just me as soon as Ny hint of drama I bounce ... good luck wish you the best but dont take any BS
These don't come from nowhere. I'd want to know where he found it
Be open an honest with them. Out of curiosity though, what movie of you don‚Äôt mind sharing?
Fellow Christian trans girl here! I imagine that the time has already come and gone, but, if it helps, here is my advice:

Talk to him. Tell him how you feel. Tell him that you're afraid that it might make you feel dysphoric or bring up religious trauma and that you want to watch a movie with him, but that you're afraid that you won't enjoy watching this particular one. If he truly cares about you and your wellbeing, then I can't imagine that he would make you sit through a movie that might make you uncomfortable.

Edit: OP, if you see this, let us know how this went, if you're willing. Also, out of curiosity, if you don't mind my asking, what's the movie?
Conversion therapy is obviously evil. Period.
It's an industrial rape organisation, and rape is a freacking CRIME. 
Tell him clearly that's not therapy, that's bullying someone to commit suicid. Period. Nothing else. No pure intent in any of this.
This is what i want to Say to him
""Nothing will change what people are, what God made them, and may i add it's a sin to think you can doubt god's plan.
Why God made trans and gay and black kids ?
BECAUSE ! Period. Don't second guess god's superior wisdom just because you, a simple human being, don't understand the plan.""

Of course people find more confortable to seek obscure part of th√© Book to justify lazy morality and evil intent.
But it's obvious to me that what lead you to do evil is not an influence from up there, but most obviously from down bellow. 
Conversion therapy is evil.
Watch it, and let him see how stupid it is. XD
Tell him the reason you don't want to watch that particular movie and suggest another movie that you would both like, so he knows you do want to watch a movie with him but it is just a sensitive subject.
Out of all the movie choices in the world‚Ä¶hmmm. ü§î Never let him choose ever again. üò§ lol. Jk. But yeah just tell him how it makes you feel.
I‚Äôm very sorry I don‚Äôt know what to do
Personally I don‚Äôt see the logic behind you getting so upset when the conversion therapy is a likely just used as a plot device. Most of the movies that I watched with conversion therapy (Miseducation of Cameron Post and Trapped) all showed the problems with this so called ‚Äútherapy‚Äù and ended really well. So yeah I think you‚Äôre overreacting, but I‚Äôm not forcing you to watch these films
I had a panic attack when I tried to watch 'Pray away' on Netflix. Didn't even make it a few minutes in.  I generally avoid anything Christian-related, except studying it from a historical and literary point of view.   


If gave me any crap about refusing to watch something, it would be an instant red flag, and I'd walk away until we were both calm enough to talk about it. Way too triggering for me.
You're right.   Maybe, explaining why it's hurtful will help.  Thank ya'll!
Ok.  Thanks!  That's exactly the support I need right now.
I'm also scared for our rights.  We're living in crazy times. The answer is in, I think, returning discrimination for kindness!  Nullify the argument before it happens!

Let's show them we aren't what they think we are.
It‚Äôs like trying to watch Handmaids Tale in a post Roe US. I‚Äôm not even afab and I still can‚Äôt do it
This may be exactly the way to put it.
For real I'm tempted to compare this to making a nazi salute at a holocaust memorial level of tone deafness
Every time I see the What's a Woman thing I just get reminded of the Alt Universe Ally Ben meme and get so fucking happy.

Thank you
He is cis and VERY pro-masculinity.  He's very much Dirty Harry.  (I know...  I got what I asked for, in hindsight, regrettably.)

Ok.  Thank you for the very good advice!
Ok. Thank you!
And but I‚Äôm a cheerleader isn‚Äôt going after Christianity. The conversion therapy referenced isn‚Äôt faith-based.
‚ÄúBut I‚Äôm a Cheerleader‚Äù is a great movie! I‚Äôve been through conversion therapy and I found the movie weirdly healing.

It‚Äôs obviously okay if OP doesn‚Äôt want to watch it! It is a good movie though.
Came here to say this but forgot the name of the movie. I LOVED that movie.

But yeah if it's like anything else that's kinda fucked up
I don't know the name of the film.  I ended up not watching it and that was ok.  If I find out, I can let you all know.
I don't know what film, but if I find out I'll let y'all know.
You realize most conversation therapy movies paint it in a negative light right?
I don't know.  I can find out, but don't want to rekindle interest.
Thank you
Thank you.  It worked out.  I came to bed late and he wasn't mad the next morning.  So, I think he might have figured it out in his head.
Thank you!  I agree.  Fortunately, it worked out.
You do realize that most of the conversion therapy movies out there paint in in a negative light, right? (Also highly recommend The Miseducation of Cameron Post, IMO that movie was great)
I don't know.  Several people have asked me. I came to bed late.  If I find out, I'll let ya'll know.
I ended up coming to bed late.  So, I don't know if he watched it or not. But, he woke up not upset with me.  So, maybe he got it.
It‚Äôs probably anti-conversion therapy (after all why would the guy marry a trans girl) so I wouldn‚Äôt worry too much
No.  I don't think so.  I'll try to find out.  I ended up not watching it.
No.  I'm pretty sure it's not that.
I haven‚Äôt watched it yet, just Trapped and The Miseducation of Cameron Post
We had the talk. I think he understands.  Thanks for your support!!!
You are absolutely wrong.  You've been brainwashed by the right wing media who is maligning our God who made you this way and loves you EXACTLY this way.  There are lots of wolves in sheep's clothing who have a political agenda.

God stands up for the oppressed.  And, who couldn't disagree we are very very oppressed.

Plus, I have medical proof we were made this way.  Check my previous posts. 

Relax, and know you ARE loved, as is, from above, regardless of how hypocrites have treated you!

That's exactly why I'm against conversion therapy.  They're flat out wrong.
Read the Bible and you‚Äôll see that ‚Äúbeing loving‚Äù  isn‚Äôt even a trait of the Christian god. He‚Äôs just some violent, egotistical moron who treats genocide like a competitive sport and has a massive sadism kink
So sorry to hear that!  But, I completely agree.
Thanks!  It worked out well for now.  I think he now understands my position.  Like I said, he's very naive to us still.  I forgive him.  :)
It‚Äôs probably one of those movies like Trapped that paint the evil process in a negative light. (I found the movie by just doing a google search)
I think he found it on Amazon or one of the Amazon-linked apps.  I don't want to ask, for fear that he'll renew his interest to watch it.
I don't know.  If I find out, I'll let ya'll know.
I kinda want to know what movie it is too
Hey girl!  It's so great to hear from a fellow trans Christian!  I'm always so sad that people think we're a contradiction.  You and I are here to prove the opposite!

And, so sorry for the delay in responding!  I got flooded with my post and fled for a while.

That night went well.  He fell asleep and never mentioned the movie again.  I don't even know the title.

Peace in Christ to you and continue to fight the good fight knowing we were created in Him to do the good works he gave us in advance to do.  :)
Totally agree with you on the evil part, but the OP didn't say the movie or her husband is pro conversion therapy.
Thank you for being so supportive.  It worked out.  He didn't have evil intent.  He was just naive.

But I agree with what you said.
Most movies that I‚Äôve seen about it are painting it in a negative light, so it‚Äôs likely that OP will be the one who is surprised. (Could be wrong tho you never know)
Thanks for the advice.  It worked out in the end.
I agree!
Thanks!  It worked out well.
I just don't want anything to do with watching anything about it.  I think movies against it would probably show scenes depicting why it's harmful, and I don't want any exposure to it.  In my opinion, conversion therapy is against my religion and I want nothing to do with it.

It's not that I'm weak.  I just don't want the negativity even discussed. It would send my dysphoria into an uncontrolled chaos.
Thanks for your supportive words.  I live under the belief that we WERE made this way.  So, IMHO Christianity supports our existence and isn't opposed to it.  (I also have medical info from a doctor that supports this.)

But regardless, if last night didn't play out the way it did, I would have very likely been traumatized.

Thank you for your help and support!
Did it help?
I'm going to also say any movie about it would expose me to it.  Not that I worry they'll convert me, because that isn't possible, in my experience. It's that it will expose me to traumatizing clips that are based in misuse of the love I know in God.  It's offensive, religiously as well as gender dysphorically.
I never could
Maybe he would like lady valor instead. It‚Äôs a documentary and the trans woman who is featured and some of the other folks don‚Äôt have the most progressive views but it‚Äôs interesting. It wouldn‚Äôt be terribly upsetting to watch before bed at least. There‚Äôs also the trans doc on Netflix w Laverne Cox. There‚Äôs a trans girl as the main character of First Day on Hulu. Some ideas of wholesome things to watch instead.
Ok. Thanks for that.
Well generic Christian references, its a film made by queer people, having fun, and pointing out why conversion therapy is dumb. Since the little gay girl wasn't even aware of her sexuality until she was egg cracked in a group session.
I didn't.  I just didn't want to be exposed to anything about it.
Hey, I hope it went okay. I‚Äôve thought about y‚Äôall.
The conversion therapy movies I've seen were an extension of the awful program I was forced into.  I had to watch several.  If there are any that tell the truth about conversion therapy it's a good thing.  Regarding the OP's post, I took it as her spouse was trying to get her into one of these programs.
The demons who've tormented me my whole life loved and followed your God. The God you worship who supports slavery, raping slaves, killing children etc. Don't preach to me.
Yeah. If it‚Äôs Boy Erased ( came to my mind first ) then while it does have some potentially triggering scenes, the movie is overall against conversion therapy and highlights how bad it actually is.
Oh, wow. It's really great to hear from you! Don't worry about the delay, it's understandable and I'm just glad everything went alright. It's good to know that relationships like yours can work out. It gives me hope, I guess.

I truly love it when I run into other trans Christians. Sometimes it feels like people like us are being torn in two opposite directions. So, it's good to know that there are others out there. Walk in love, as Christ loved us.
Ikr, don‚Äôt make assumptions on stuff like this when there is no data to support it. This is exactly how gossip is made smh
My dysphoria brings up pre-transition PTSD-like trauma.  (Been mentally hospitalized many times.)  That's why I want nothing to do with it.

But, I believe you.  Wish I was more resilient.
>I live under the belief that we WERE made this way.  So, IMHO Christianity supports our existence and isn't opposed to it.  (I also have medical info from a doctor that supports this.)

Medical info from a doctor that supports what? Genuinely curious. 

I can't get behind Christianity in any form personally, I don't see any reason to look at it as anything more than any other myth.
I think so!  :)
Not watching did help.  :)
Good point! I hope everything went well!!
I tried, got a few episodes in, it hit too close to home and I noped the fuck out. I still kind of want to finish it, strictly out of morbid curiosity, but even before Roe v. Wade got overturned it triggered me way too much.
Ok.  Thanks so much for the suggestions!
I watched pray away on Netflix recently and didn‚Äôt realize how close to fact but I‚Äôm a cheerleader is. The whole ‚Äúfind your root‚Äù thing is 100% real and they actually make people come up with an incident in their past that ‚Äúturned them gay.‚Äù So I‚Äôd say they showcase the same methods (minus the physical abuse) that actual conversion therapy uses but there aren‚Äôt any religious references beyond a couple yarmulkas.
It did go well.  Thank you so much for your concern and support.
Your referring to a false god, not the one who loves you EXACTLY how you are.  And definitely not the one who supports slavery, raping slaves, and killing children. 

The right wing is misaligning the truly LOVING GOD who made us this way!

I've read the Bible cover to cover and only find support for us.

Plus medical evidence from my GCS surgeon showed me we were made this way.

God is with you.  Don't believe the purely political, false religion lies.
Didn‚Äôt I watch that one, yeah I think I did.
Amen!  It's all about love and grace.  And, yes, we were made this way, by our loving Father!
Walk in my shoes for a day, and you'll see God definitely answers humanly impossible prayers.

As far as the medical evidence, my GCS surgeon woke me up to say that she saves this for post-op recovery.

A medical study found that in MTF trans girls, an in vitro rush of estrogen comes down the fallopian tubes, post secondary sex development, but prior to full brain development.  So, for the rest of pregnancy, the brain develops female.  Other scientific evidence shows trans brains are sized more closely to the identity gender.

Hence, you were made this way.

The Bible has a verse about God forming us in the womb.  

This would all be beyond the mother or father's control.

I know there is a push for chromosomal support.  But, in my opinion, that's not necessary.

Science, medicine, and religion already definitively point to the fact that we were made this way.
I think he may have caught my anxiety and I didn't even get exposed to it!
Ok, I'll stay away from it!  Thanks!
Glad to hear it :)
If you read the Bible you'd see God kills children and supports slavery. You can't pick and choose. God hates you and God hates me.
Exactly, I just wish more people understood and accepted that.
Uh oh, well at least he will hopefully be more empathetic in the future then üòÖ
Maybe someday I'll be able to, but I don't think today is it, much like CNC I'm just not mentally ready for it.
You have to read the context of why.  And, you're referring to Old Testament.  Christ changed all that in the New Testament.

Conservative hypocrites want to cage everyone into Old Testament thinking. 

Christ's death did away with all that.

God made you, and me, and wants us, AS IS, in his kingdom.  We just have to believe.  That's it.  Trans or not.
Yes!  I agree!  Thanks!
Understand completely!
>Christ changed all that in the New Testament.

Did he? Says who?
The Bible
So the old testament is all nothing now according to the new testament? Where's it say that?
Read the New Testament and you'll see what I mean.
It's all about belief, not acions or inactions.
I've extensively read and studied the new testament. I don't see what you mean. Paul said stuff like that, but Paul was a horrible person. 

Paul never met Jesus. 

We have no first hand accounts of the life of Christ. We only have what Paul wrote, and then what was written in the gospels decades to centuries later.  Not to mention a good part of the gospels are clearly fabricated and don't match the historical record.   

Don't get me wrong.  You believe what you want, but you should really dig into New Testament research from scholars who aren't Christians.  There is a reason why everyone who studies it at a scholarly level leaves the faith. It just doesn't add up.

Quick Edit.  This is also a triggering topic for many of us here.  It's probably best to move it somewhere else.  I believe there is a dedicated trans Christian subreddit."	w9wuqd	trans	673	0.97	2022-07-28 02:00:08
An apology to my fellow trans people for my transphobia in the past	I used to be a massive transphobe when I was young and before I realized what I was, I took my anger out on trans people because of my transphobic parents and because I couldn't accept what I was. I've done damage that's unacceptable. I wish I was able to accept myself sooner and I wish I was able to go back and not be a transphobic POS. I just wanna say I'm sorry for my actions, I'm sorry to all the fellow trans girls I hurt, I'm sorry for everything I've done from 2016-2019 that hurt trans people. I don't know if I deserve to have my apology accepted, but I hope to acknowledge my horrible past and distance myself from who I used to be. I hope all you beautiful trans girls and trans boys have a good day.	"I came out in the last few months.  I also have said some pretty stupid transphobic things because I was self-hating, and I don't even have the excuse of transphobic parents.  If you can actually apologize and come out to those specific people it can do a whole world of good for them. You'll probably find they are more forgiving than you would be to yourself, and if not, at least it is understandable why they wouldn't be.
Yeah, I can actually relate a lot. Before I realized I was trans and bi I used to be a pretty homophobic and transphobic assface. Some people are LGBTphobic because they were in denial, and you owning up to that and wanting to apologize proves that you're a good person at heart.
The alt-right likes to convince one another that no-one else will EVER accept them after all the hatespeech they've participated in.

They go so far as to doxx one another to that end.

The fact is that most all of us grow up in a blender of oppressive speech, not just transphobic, but white supremacy, capitalism, ableism, mono-centric, allo-centric, on and on.

The fact is that a young person just wants to feel accepted, and ends up regurgitating toxic vitriol that they themselves didn't invent.

The fact is that EVERYONE can choose to educate themselves, and develop an immunity to the mania.   That mania is the result of Fear-Propaganda.

The fact is we accept one another, and part of that is accepting our OWN internalized toxic behavior.   Transphobia or otherwise.   You are loved.  We will prevail over this injustice.
We all have made mistakes in the past fir exemple I used to laughte at helicopter at jokes some years ago, if you are able to see your wrong then you have improved a lot so apology accepted we must stay angry at someone who try to change after bad oast action but learn to forgive and move forward
It takes a lot to own up to your mistakes. I‚Äôm so happy that you accepted yourself for who you really are. I know how hurtful denial can be. You hurt yourself and others, thank you for sharing.
Most lgbtq people used to be incredibly homophobic and transphobic.
I used to be like this as well, mostly because I was taking in the environment I lived in. I learned to become a better person in time, and sometimes I still feel bad for how I acted. But we forgive you. People grow and change all the time, and the world could be a much better place if we grew for the better, like you did.
I used to be pretty homophobic too because of the Christian upbringing. Being told something is a sin enough times will eventually get you to believe it. But being ashamed of your past doesn‚Äôt make you a bad person, it simply means that you have grown! It‚Äôs not your fault for believing the things you were taught, but what matters more is that you were able to overcome your conditioning and become a better person for it.
I used to be extremely queerphobic myself, even when I was a closeted ally I'd still act queerphobic so that my parents would not abuse me over it. I guess karma got me and I couldn't suppress my gender feelings anymore, causing me to leave my parents' conssrvative bullshit cult, so now I am a proud but mostly closeted trans lesbian.
The fact that you not only realized your mistake, but owned up to it AND apologized, means you're a *good person*, OP.  I think your apology deserves to be accepted, at least from me :)
I used to be a transphobe, not actively insulting people regularly but I did talk trash when I was alone with my nonbinary sibling. It was one of the things I regret the most, saying those things without even knowing they were transgender. I used to battle with myself a lot too until I finally accepted myself. You‚Äôre not alone, I understand how you feel and felt.
The greatest thing we could hope for someone who is bigoted is for them to change their hearts and speak for the causes they once persecuted. All is well, I was once a transphobe too.
I struggle with internalized transphobia. I feel horrible when I do it. I take my anger out on trans girls that dont pass. The anger I'm letting out is the feeling I don't pass and never will
I try not to judge people on there worst mistakes, even if they don‚Äôt know there making a mistake yet.
Pretty much all trans people were transphobic in the past dont worry about it too much
Damm,I thought I was the only ex-transphobic that turned out to be trans!
When I started to realize that I was trans I was like ""No no no,I'm a boy that looks like a girl"" but now I know Im a girl.
Hey, it's alright! Hating members of the lgbtq community is often taught as a ""sin"" or ""crime"" from a young age, sadly. Most people who are taught this from a young age, they often don't know how it feels to be unaccepted by the world for something that they can't change until they personally experience it themselves
It's okay we forgive you! Honestly I think we've all been phobic in the past! But the past isn't the present!
Please know it‚Äôs OK it‚Äôs all part of the same thing I was really quite hypocritical of Bruce Jenner when he decided to transition to Kaitlyn. Of all people I should have been more tolerant but I was outspokenly mean and acted with disdain and arrogance. The best part of acknowledging the love I have and the truth I have for myself is compassion and understanding and I to owe the trans community of which I consider myself a part an open apology as well . but like you said it‚Äôs all part of running away from and unable to accept the true nature of my own gender which is Decidedly female nomatter what I look like on the outside
In middle school just finding out I was trans female, I wasn‚Äôt opposed to other people being trans, it was more me giving myself hell that my gender identity needed ‚Äútoo much work for that to be who I am, and it didn‚Äôt make sense to go through that unnecessary bullying.‚Äù 

Looking back at it, that was transphobic in a sense and all those jerks who tossed my identity to the side built my character. 

I guess we just accept the love we think we deserve! (including with ourselves)
I was homophobic before I accepted I was bisexual in 2016, I'm glad I've accepted who I am.
In did this when I realized back in February that I am trans. Had to completely de-program myself. ContraPoints and similar channels have been a huge help. But I remember that in the last year of my brainwashed delusions, I did start supporting the LGBTQ+ community and making that clear, which pissed off a lot of my social media audience. I'm real happy I managed to wipe my deadname almost entirely off the bet with next to nothing ever being archived.
Be careful with grouping everyone together. Not all right wingers are pieces of shit just like not all trans people are pedophiles. My uncle who's the most right wing person since Alex Jones is totally okay with lgbt people and has actually gotten into fist fights over people being transphobic to me, and people being homophobes. Where I'm from lgbt people and right wing people over lap heavily.
It's getting worse too on both sides. Our values on what it means to live in a civilized society are degrading the more radicalized we become. Hate speech is becoming more encrypted in false advocacies making individuals more comfortable in believing in completely inhumane standards. In the end people care less and less about there fellow man(ei mankind) all due to a negativity bias and it's sad. I just wanna live my life and I want it to be socially acceptable to do so, but identity is so wrapped up in the idea war that regardless if it's morally correct to validate and respect me I will be used as a tool for someone's talking points. I will be seen as a trans person and not as a human trying to live their lives. The primary suspect of this problem isn't the left or the right, it is the state. They fuel this division to maintain control and we all eat it up.
Same, it was a really long bumpy road but now things are a lot smoother.
People on the left like to slam contrapoints and other breadtubers but they've done a lot to de program people. I used to be hard right pretty much until I heard about Andrew yang and interacting with his supporters led me to people like contrapoints, philosophy tube, thought slime, and noncompete. These channels helped me see the world for what it is instead of what I'm told it is.
First off, I specifically said alt-right.   That is, neo-nazis.

Furthermore, I have spent a great deal of my life traveling to various parts of the US, and spoke for many, many hours, with many different conservatives.  


Right-leaning people are individuals, and not a monolith, to be certain.   Some can be friends.

Collectively though, when they act, they are never allies, much less accomplices.     


Read me right.  Their individual actions might be accomplice actions; defending you against transphobes.   Sure.

&#x200B;

When they act as a group though, the conservative party is outright dehumanizing.   I've got quite a busy day and won't be checking reddit.   Sorry you didn't get to hear what you wanted to, but that's the reality I know to be true.

Sincerely,  
\-- the ghost of Emma Goldman ‚ô•"	n16gpc	trans	512	0.98	2021-04-29 15:09:53
Found out my dad has been using my deadname behind my back for years	"I‚Äôm not even sure why I‚Äôm posting here, I am just fuming with anger. He‚Äôs my dad, he‚Äôd always been by my side even if he was kind of distant (my parents divorced when I was 12, I‚Äôm 21 now) and I trusted him with my life.

Everything fucking changed like 20 minutes ago when I was chilling with my 14yo brother and he told me ¬´¬†also it‚Äôs nice, dad is finally using your real name (aka not my deadname) when we talk¬†¬ª

I had absolutely no idea he did that, he was all nice and respectful and using the right damn name when I saw him and I JUST find out he‚Äôs been giving no shit for 5 years ?!

I don‚Äôt know what do to or what to think, I‚Äôm writing all of this out of pure anger, right now all I want is to never hear from him again and send back every penny he‚Äôs ever sent me (his main way of being in my life is to send me money when he has extra to help with rent) I might be overreacting but I honestly don‚Äôt care. 

If anyone has advice, or can just relate or something, you‚Äôre absolutely welcome. I might calm down and delete this, but rn I really need to write it down somewhere.

Thank you and sorry for the vent.

Edit : clarified what ¬´¬†real name¬†¬ª meant"	"fuck. that must suck so hard. i think taking some distance is definitely the best action now. take your time to find out for you, what this means for you. don't comfront him while you're this angry and unsure about what it means to you. take your time and your well needed space
I can understand if it takes people a bit to get used to the name change, but 5 fucking years?!?! And why did he start just now? Like?? I'm mad now. I just sat up in bed and turned the light on for this.

My little brother used to go by a shorthand for his legal name, but like a year and a half ago he decided to start going by his full name. my parents and older sibling still don't call him by his preferred name. It makes me so fucking mad. Anytime I confront them about it they give the excuse of ""oh well he's gone by that name for 13 years of his life sooooooo"" like stfu it's been a year and a half of me correcting you. Gonna have to get the spray bottle and spray them every time they say it wrong. 

God I hate people. Sorry you have to go through this OP.
Ya know I can understand at first, hell even the first year! I'd even say let it slide at two. But Give Fucking Years??? I've literally gone from cis straight male, to  potentially (still figuring this out) bi trans female in that time span. I don't know how someone could be so brick headed and inconsiderate!!!
My dad still hates my chosen name, even tho it's legally my middle name. My first name reminds me of a washed up ""all I want for Christmas is you"" pop star that I very much dislike. I cannot escape it, it seems.
That sucks.

This is my experience and might not apply to you. I was adopted and my birth name was hard to pronounce so my parents turned it into my middle name. The fam just wont prnounce it right. They call me sarah. Nope. Not the same language bud. 

Now my cousin is transitioning and my fam is pulling this bs of ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to say. We know you by your other name. Give us time.‚Äù It‚Äôs been two years. 

When someone does not take the time to learn your name, or pronounce it properly then it is insulting. It‚Äôs YOUR name. You choose what to be called and it doesn‚Äôt belong to your parents or family. It‚Äôs ok to get upset. It‚Äôs ok to be angry. 

My cousins parents also use her deadname in public. I correct them because I can tell how much it hurts her. They got angry with me and told me that I shouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúput out something that complicated and personal.‚Äù Umm what decade have your crawled out from. There is a lot of material out there about gender identity. This might prompt people to look it up. Or if they start treating you like shit, then I‚Äôll kick someone‚Äôs ass. I get not wanting to be discriminated against, but my cousin is fully out. Her feelings matter more than their reputation. Nothing will change if people keep this a secret. It should be normalized.
I can only imagine how furious you must be. I mean, I at least know that my parents still use my deadname behind my back (and a lot right to my face) but not knowing must hurt, especially after 5 damn years. Honestly best thing you can do is having a reasonable talk with him.
I corrected my father when he used my deadname the other day and he just huffed angrily, stared at me like I was the one in the wrong, and didn't talk until I said anything. Shit's so frustrating
I think a lot more cis people do this than we would like to think. I am absolutely certain my father deadnames me when I am not there. They don't get it and it takes them years to get used to it. In time I began to numb to it, but...if you can find it in your heart to forgive these poor fools, I do believe it will make things easier on you.
but your brother meant ""real name"" as in your deadname or your actual name? cause he could've meant either and this kinda changes the context for me
That‚Äôs incredibly shitty of him, I don‚Äôt think you‚Äôre overreacting at all. Personally, I wouldn‚Äôt give him any money back, though. He shouldn‚Äôt get a payday for treating you like shit behind your back. If you want to distance yourself from his money, it could go to way better places than back in his pockets.
Wow that's really shitty. Sorry to hear :( sending love <3
I'm 33 and just told my family I was having gender identity issues less than 2 months ago. My dad over all doesn't care, but said I will always be his son James.

A little disrespectful...but I get it...but it's kinda selfish. I'm glad I don't care about labels and pronouns too much so I can have a fairly decent relationship still, but it's wack if I focus on the implications of what he said.

Just love and accept yourself and understand that even those you love the most can be ignorant and bigoted. Some shit just doesn't click in their heads. They CANNOT understand things from another perspective. It sucks though, I know. Keep your head up.
From the sounds of it you are openly trans so he has no reason to use your deadname with others. I would just sit down with him over a cup and ask him what his motivations were in doing this. Who knows, he might have thought it was okay to use and not have any sort of malice behind it. If he's important it's worth a shot. Sorry that it happened to you though. Have a better day than the last.
Two options mate 
Have a talk
Else
Minimize contact till he realizes his mistake
Here's a perspective that may or may not help. I'm a Dad to a 19 yo. They came out to me as nb a few years ago. I didn't ""get it""; I wasn't educated around trans issues, and was very ignorant of and thus disrespectful about the whole thing. I've been deadnaming them for a couple of years.

Please understand that when I grew up, transgenderism was largely considered by everyone around me to be sexual deviance. A weird fetish. It was not only acceptable to be transphobic (and homophobic and every other kind of lgbtq2-phobic), but extremely normal.

My point isn't that it's a valid perapective, it's that there's an explanation beyond ""he's an asshole."" But my next point is that there's hope for a better tomorrow.

See, as it turns out, I'm trans. I only just really realized it last month. And, as I've read and learned and explored about it, I've come to understand not only how unfair and hurtful my behaviour ariunf my child's non-binary-ness has been, but where it came from and why it happened. So, I have some apologising and atoning to do. 

But please understand, the lack of grace in respecting the gender identity and expression didn't come from a place of evil but a place of ignorance. Thus, the opportunity exists to repair the damage to your relationship but it will take some honesty, some courage, some vulnerability, and some education. It's unlikely that your dad is trans like me so they won't be primed for understanding, but I'm going to bet your dad loves you so very much that and honest and sensitive conversation will help alleviate most of your hurting.

I'm sorry you're dealing with this. Ignorance sucks, and is rampant.
I‚Äôm having a really hard time giving you dad the benefit of any doubt here, and I‚Äôm really trying to find one.

The best I can come up with is he genuinely thought it was fine to use your dead name when you‚Äôre not around. Which still isn‚Äôt good, but at least not malicious or willfully negligent.

But after 5 years? Like after a year many people in my life would look at someone very confused if they referred to me by my dead name. Like it becomes a communication issue using my dead name in a lot of situations.

Definitely take time to calm down. Go back to him with a cool level head and tell him you‚Äôve found out he‚Äôs been dead naming you for years. That it makes you feel like he‚Äôs just been humoring you this whole time and didn‚Äôt believe a word of what he was saying. That it made you so angry that you wanted to give back all the money he gave you and never speak to him again.

His reaction will tell you everything you need to know.
That sucks.

But, before you cut contact or anything, give yourself some time to calm down, and then talk to him. While five years is a loooong time, he may just be an idiot and thought it was okay to use your deadname when you weren't around. Sit down with him and talk about it. Let him know it hurt you and see how he reacts. Maybe he realizes he messed up, maybe he doesn't. It's probably worth talking to people before you actively cut them out of your life.
i fuckin feel ya. my parents dont call me my preferred name at all, whether im around or not
[removed]
This is a bit counter to what many are saying here, but ima say it anyway. 
Your journey is your journey and a parents path to accepting you is also a journey. 5 years is a long time, and deadnaming you behind your back sucks. 
But 
It sounds like he tried to be respectful to your face before he may have been ready. And it sounds like he‚Äôs stopped deadnaming you while not in your presence.
It sounds like the guy does want to love and respect you in his own limited way, and has made advances in his own journey to understanding you. 
Maybe don‚Äôt shove him away or take him too harshly.
As a dad myself, please don‚Äôt cut him out of your life. He was wrong to have been deadnaming you for years and you are right to be upset, but it seems to me that he loves and cares for you and is not deadnaming you anymore. If you two have a good enough relationship where you can talk freely over your feelings I think it would be good if you told him you know he was deadnaming you and told him how upset you feel about it, so you can air out those feelings and he can continue learning how to be better.
Courage sweetheart, I'm here with you my little cat-cow <33
Sending hugs üíï

Any chance it was only with your brother, because he underestimated your brother‚Äôs ability to understand or adapt at a younger age? I see that kind of thing a fair amount (underestimating kids, rather than malice) üíï
My dad does the same thing, never calls me his daughter just his child and constantly dead names me to other ppl then has the audacity to say that he's being supportive
[removed]
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing rn, cooling off and getting some rest. I feel hurt more than angry rn, which is somewhat worse, but calming down is nice. Distance definitely sounds good.
I support you and your brother with all of my heart, no one should have to go through shit like this in their own family, that is complete bullshit.

Also thanks, I feel supported
(And also sorry for making you mad I guess)
I know, that‚Äôs fucking insane.
Thanks for the support, it helps a lot.

I hope everything goes right for you, don‚Äôt let anyone get in the way of figuring this shit out.
What is it with dads and names ?? 
I‚Äôve been going by my chosen name since the beginning of my transition (~ 5 years as mentioned) and it very quickly became my actual legal name, my deadname couldn‚Äôt be more dead. But how could that be enough for Mr.Dad ??? 
You have all my support.
I very much agree with everything here, thank you.
I really hope you and your cousin can one day go by your real names without having to deal with this shit.
Honestly talking to him is the last thing I want to do, but that might change when I get to cool down enough to think reasonably.

I really hope you get to be called by your preferred name, especially by your family. You have all my support.
Damn I cannot believe these people.
I hope you‚Äôre okay and it gets better
Yeah, the best answer I can give to that is maybe I will, I honestly don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to feel better about that as long as he deadnames me. But maybe that‚Äôs not worth kicking my own dad out of my life.
Ah yes, didn‚Äôt make that very clear, by ¬´¬†real name¬†¬ª I mean my current name, not my deadname.
Very true
Thank you so much, much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
That‚Äôs some nice advice, thank you.

I hope your dad wakes up one day, much luck for your gender identity journey !
Thanks, I really, really don‚Äôt wanna talk to him for now but maybe in a little while I‚Äôll think back about it, it could indeed help me at least try to understand how this happened
I think I‚Äôll go with the second one
It helps, you‚Äôre probably right about a lot of things here. Thanks
Solid advice, thank you very much
Thanks, I‚Äôm really sorry this is happening, I hope you‚Äôll be okay
That‚Äôs nice of you. You didn‚Äôt hurt my feelings, it was just said in a somewhat rude way. But like I said there is some truth to it, even tho to me this is about more than a name, it‚Äôs like he‚Äôs rejecting my identity and the person I‚Äôve become. Maybe this is an overstatement but it‚Äôs how it feels like. I‚Äôll know for sure if I ever talk to him about that.
Thank you for pointing out the good things in a painful situation, I believe you‚Äôre right. I‚Äôm still angry at him, but yeah. I‚Äôll remember that.
Thank you sweetie ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt know, only my brother told me that and I haven‚Äôt talked to my dad yet. A day later I still don‚Äôt want to, but I‚Äôll get to it someday. 

I honestly hope it was just with my brother, but I doubt it. At the end I have no way of knowing for sure without asking him.
That‚Äôs messed up. My dad at the very least calls me by my chosen name to my face.
I really hope it gets better for you
it is a trans sub

and even for cis people pronouncing their names wrong with no intention of change is extremely insulting

and its not just being deadnamed its being lied to

the dads finally being half decent but he lied for years and thats worse
That sounds kinda rude but there could be some truth to it
I'm still waaay unsure about myself. I've been quite the shitty person for a good chunk of my life, so it's quite difficult to adjust. but fingers crossed I'll figure stuff out eventually. (I actually made a post here kinda diving into my story a bitüòÖ)

Also, hopefully he'll learn to actually care and not be a prick. Since he's only *now* started using your real name
Yeah.. Unfortunately my dad is ""old school"". Can't teach and old dog new tricks I guess.
Oh they're trying, don't worry about me. But yeah, firstly calm down and you'll see what you'll do. Talking just brings hidden shit to the surface, so that's always a good approach. But thank you, really. It means a lot :)
I'm fine, nothing he says matters to me- but it does get annoying. Especially when the person is someone who should love you unconditionally. 
I'm sorry you had to go through that, unfortunately too many of us can empathize I think. But I guess that means you're not alone haha. 
I hope things get better for you!
No problem. Sorry I ranted so much. I could just really relate...and all this is new for me so the feelings are fresh. I hope things are good for you and continue to get better. Don't let the ignorance hold you down/back. If he's using your new name now that's a sign of progress at least!
Before you do anything
Think it through! I repeat!Think it through!
I hope you can repair your relationship. There's so much love to share, it's a shame when emotions impact communication and relationships suffer. Your dad can learn. I hope he wants to.
Hopefully that‚Äôs all it was. Something I‚Äôll throw out there to think about. Even though the behavior hurts, what will matter in the end are three things: 

1. Why he did it 
2. What that means about his feelings for you and who he knows you as up till now
3. How he is willing to grow if you talk to him and express what you need from him and who you want to be in his life. 

I am making up a story in my head that your dad feels like a clumsy outsider in your life and doesn‚Äôt know how to be closer with you. If you described to him the ideal relationship you‚Äôd like to build with him and little things he could do that would mean the world to you, he might jump at the chance üíï
Thanks :)
It was an extremely rude way to say that. But yes, only you can decide if the relationship with your father is worth ruining over any issue.  
You should talk about it.
Yeah, hopefully he‚Äôs on the right track now, about time. 

Might give your story a read !
That‚Äôs also true, at the very least he seems to be on the right track.
No worries at all about ranting, this post is literally a big rant and I am absolutely fine with other people sharing their own rants in the comments
Yeah that sounds like good advice
Yep, that sounds about right, that is indeed what I‚Äôm more interested in finding out. Thanks
Fingers crossed. Fingers are very much crossed. I mean, progress is progress, right..,? 

Also fair warning, I did kinda write it during an emotional peak a few nights ago, when watching Leadhead's video on her transition. So apologies if it makes literally no sense.
Well, thank you. Sending love and support your way ‚ù§
Dont rush or go with impulse... if you wanna talk my discord is SgYear#0380 in case‚úåÔ∏è
It looks like your post was removed ? Is it the one from 10h ago ?

Transgender Stages of grief	"‚ÄºÔ∏èTW‚ÄºÔ∏è

Denial- ‚Äú I‚Äôm alright, I can live w being a boy, I want to be a girl but that‚Äôs normal everyone thinks that sometimes, I am a boy‚Äù

Anger ( a.k.a puberty ) ‚Äú body just fucking stop, what your doing is horrible plz stop‚Äù 
‚Äú I‚Äôll cut u if u don‚Äôt stop ‚Äú
‚Äú I‚Äôll starve u if u don‚Äôt stop ‚Äú 

Bargaining - ‚Äú as long as I can have long hair, I‚Äôll be ok. If I can at least be a little feminine. I‚Äôll be alright. I am normal. I mean I rly want it but it‚Äôs easier to keep hiding it. I don‚Äôt need all that transition stuff. No one would believe me anyway. I should of said something as a kid but now it‚Äôs to late‚Äù 

Depression - ‚Äú I can‚Äôt even have nice hair‚Ä¶. I can‚Äôt be me at all‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm so tired of this. The pain is too much and I can‚Äôt have the life I want. I couldn‚Äôt pass anyway. If I have to shave one more time I might just use the razor differently. ‚Äú

Acceptance - ‚Äú Alright! I‚Äôm gonna do it! I‚Äôm going to transition! I am going to fight for me! I am going to ask for help!‚Äù

Revelation - ‚Äú Everyone I want u to know who I am, who I RLY am. Plz don‚Äôt hate me ‚Äú"	"I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm in the depression or acceptance stage or a mix of both
Damn. I'm in the denial stage at the moment and I wasn't really sure anyone else felt like that. Thank you. This has helped me :)
I would say I'm probably in bargaining.
The long hair part got me so hard! This was very accurate for me.
>Bargaining - ‚Äú as long as I can have long hair, I‚Äôll be ok. If I can at least be a little feminine. I‚Äôll be alright. I am normal. I mean I rly want it but it‚Äôs easier to keep hiding it. I don‚Äôt need all that transition stuff. No one would believe me anyway. I should of said something as a kid but now it‚Äôs to late‚Äù 

HOLY FUCK!  Me in my teens.  üò≥

Saddest thing... I passed in my teens and early 20's, long before I came out.  Long hair, barely any facial hair, no beard shadow, girlish frame.  I passed enough that it scared me away from transitioning, and by my 30's, my hair was thinning.  That was a major thing that made me transition.  Luckily, my hair's coming back.  Thank fuck.

Kinda funny that I kinda transitioned and detransitioned while still being in the closet, only to transition for real a decade and a half later.
Since I was a teen I've found the album Welcome to the Black Parade from My Chemical Romance to be perfect for coping with ""the grief of being trans""

It uses death as a metaphor for coming out as being trans / queer. Though, in some places it kinda drops the metaphor altogether! The lead artist (Gerard Way) has said before they identify more with the female gender more than their AGAB, and is in some undefined place in the trans femme area, and has openly stated their music was meant to express those confusing and painful feelings.
Bargaining or depression is what I am at
Bargaining and depression
Damn... I‚Äôm.. im at revelation. 

Thank god it‚Äôs fucking over what a roller coaster
A mix of depression and acceptance is my placement currently tbh
I am a mix of depression and acceptance.

Edit: also some anger that manifests itself in many different ways.
Im jumping between Depression and Revelation
Omg this is so real! Currently in between bargaining and depression but I‚Äôm excited for acceptance :)
I feel I skipped a few stages
im jumping between depression and acceptance, between this is so accurate!! im kinda happy to know that im not the only one feeling this way :)
Wow that's surprisingly accurate. I spent so much time in denial.. I was in a relationship which made me bottle everything up as deep as I can by fear to loose everything, which ultimately backfired.

While in bargaining, I feared to do anything by fear not to pass or to be judged not trans enough. I always was an introvert but in retrospect I should have talked about it to a close friend much earlier..

I guess I'm in acceptance now, I called back my psy and hope to move forward, because I can't stay like this forever
I‚Äôm in a mix of depression, acceptance and revelation, that‚Äôs for sure, because I can be myself when I‚Äôm with my best friend on Discord, just the two of us, and he even accepts me as a girl, and I also want to transition and start HRT, but I‚Äôm also super closeted to everyone who isn‚Äôt my mom, sister and my best friend‚Ä¶
I relate with this a lot, thank you op
Deep in depression, thinking it'll never get better honestly
I experienced every step over the course of more than 30 years....I'm finally living as ""me.""
Wait, how can males not have long good looking hair?
I think i will die in the depression phase
Ty for the step by step on how to feel and what to expect
mate, please edit in what your tw is about. Warning about triggers without saying what you're warning people about is useless.
Do you mind me copying this?
Wow that Bargaining one hit me hard
Accurate <3
dayum very real. I went back to denial a bunch of times throughout the grief process
Depression. Yay.
I feel called out...
""As long as i can have long hair I'll be okay."" I literally told this to myself the other night
Maybe anger.
Huh, I didn't know that, and that's despite having MCR on loop throught my teenage years.

Is there a stage before denial where you can have the facts of your situation blasted directly into your ears - yet still be completely oblivious?
Yeah that one hasn‚Äôt rly left me either :((
I am agreeing with what you said.. i felt that this link was interesting addition to your statement.  Not saying trigger warnings are bad personally.  ..... 
But recent studies are suggesting that they are not only unhelpful but can actually promote anxiety and withdrawal.

What and what?"	pzr59i	trans	361	0.98	2021-10-02 08:16:27
Does anyone else get realy jelous and resentful of cis family members?	"Like when i look at my brother i find myself thinking ""that could have been me"" or when i heard the baby my dad is having with my step mom is a boy i felt this weird feeling of anger, sadness and dread"	"Personally, my biggest source of dysphoric jealousy has been other trans people who managed to start HRT in their early teen years and pass effortlessly. Sometimes I see timelines of people who started at 15 and are now my age (22/23), and they look just like a cis girl, and I just think to myself ""what's the point of even trying if I'll never look like her? If I'll never get to relive my teen years as a girl""? I know this type of mindset is toxic and horrible, I know passing shouldn't necessarily be the end goal, and I don't *want* to be jealous and bitter, I *want* to be supportive and happy for these people who get to transition and live as their true self from a really young age, but I don't know *how*. Maybe I just need to get the poison hormones out of my brain first, I don't know.
I think I did as a child (but couldn‚Äôt articulate the feeling of envy). I don‚Äôt so much now.
Hi. I'm FtM. I was jealous that my cis little brother got to have super hero undies as a kid. üòÜ He has the masc equivalent of my birth name. And we've always been close. I kinda thought of him as me if I'd been AMAB. 

üòì But... the real true envy and resentment that gnawed at my soul for 2+ decades...

I was super envious of my cis step sister. We met as I was starting female puberty. Shes 2 years older than me. Its weird but I was jealous that I just couldn't seem to make myself be a girl like she was. It was just so easy for her to be a girl. 

It took 26 years (yep, I mathed), therapy and starting my transition to make that revelation.
I also feel like this, I have 3 AMAB brothers and then there's me, why couldn't I also be like them?
I'm a trans woman. My sibling, who is 10, is showing all the signs of being a trans boy. I obviously love and support him, but I can't stop a part of my brain from resenting him a little for, sort of, ""throwing away"" womanhood when it's what I've always wanted, even if I didn't know it.

It's a stupid thought and I hate it, but we unfortunately can't control how we feel.
There's also jealousy of those who have been bold and together enough, knowing themselves enough, to explore their gender identity and do it honestly.... As an older cis amab I am just in awe of trans folk who take control of their own self identity so much as to be themselves despite social expectations and pressure. It may be that op could have been sibs that are jealous too for completely mirrored reasons. Just a thought. :)

Edit: Also wanna validate OPs feelings btw. Even as cis I get how that's gonna happen.
I'm currently in the process of grieving that childhood I never got. 
While my older brother was playing soccer I was stuck in ballet. 
When we went to the lake or camping my dad taught my brother to skip rocks and whistle with blades of grass while what my dad taught me was to make flower crowns. (I cried in the tent on camping trips when I knew people were asleep)
My brother did robotics I did girl scouts
Walking past the bathroom seeing my dad teach my brother to shave(this one hit the hardest)

It took me a while to not hate my brother for living so easily. Even before I knew I was trans the fact he could date a girl and talk to our parents as though it was normal and I had to hide it because I didn't know if mom and dad liked gay people.

But he's been the one to teach me the things I never learned as a kid from our dad, though I don't know if he realizes the significance to me. He taught me how to shave my face when I came out to him in highschool, he taught me to skip a rock, to whistle with grass, hell he even taught me when to leave a relationship with a girl who's toxic. My brother has always been my biggest supporter and I don't think he even realizes. While I may never have the experience of a cis man i hope that someday I will accept and even enjoy the childhood I did have. 

The second I came out. He started calling me his brother. And I couldn't be more grateful for that.
Definitely. I feel the same with my oldest brother. It‚Äôs come to the point where I can‚Äôt tell if his style is genuinely what I like, or if I‚Äôm just trying to copy him out of spite. Optimistically, I‚Äôd like to think the former.
I used to. I have a cousin about half a year older than me I was very close with growing up and it was agonizing to see him go through puberty and get all the things I wanted (I.e. height, facial hair, deep voice) while I went through the wrong puberty. 

Now that I'm an adult and I've had time to come to terms with who I am, how I look and my version of masculinity, I don't get jealous anymore. I'm who I am and I've learned that's just fine. I think for a lot of trans people you'll reach that acceptance later in life and it won't seem so horribly unfair anymore.

And personally, I think cis boys ought to be jealous of *me*. üíÖ
I feel so bad about it because my cousin has been one of my biggest supporters but he gives me such a ridiculous amount of gender envy. 

He wore a suit for a special occasion once and all I could do was compare what I looked like in a suit and it made me want to scream.
I get ya, everytime I see my sister brush her ponytail, I think ‚Äú I wish I can do that too‚Äù or when she wears a cute dress, I get jealous too
No don‚Äôt really feel anything except if they disrespect me.   But i hear your angle ‚Äúthat could have been me‚Äù.   Best to just come to terms with yep, I agree, but it was hasn‚Äôt and that‚Äôs the hard truth.    Also you are a very special and unique person and have special traits and qualities this cis people don‚Äôt have and will never understand.
All the time. Basically, I'm jealous of almost every cis guy. Especially if they take their shirts off or something. Makes me wish I could do that.
Not personally cus I'm the hotter brother lol. If I were raised a guy I wouldn't be me.
Family members? Not at all.
The source of most of my dysphoria comes from feminine men and mlm relationships I see on social media
My sisters were both gorgeous as teens, and I was a masculine potato. I‚Äôm MtF, and being half as pretty of my sisters is this horribly unhealthy goal in the back of my head, and layered under that is trying to outshine them.

In addition to that is the crushing sadness that I waited until I was 28 to start HRT when I had a way to get black market HRT in HS. So yeah, I get it.
Most of my cousins are girls and I get mad gender envy from them so yeah‚Ä¶..
Yeah, I get really sad when I see cis men because I think about how easy their lives are and how I wish I had that ease of living.
yes i feel bad about it too üò≠üò≠
All the time with my sister
My sister lol
Not anymore. I realized being jealous and resentful wasn't fair towards them and those emotions weren't helping me in any sort of way.
Your dad came wrong, and it's all been downhill from there  
(Context is that the sex chromosome the dad gives determines the ""sex"" of a child, kind of? in the most common instances the father gives an X, making an afab individual, or a Y chromosome, making an amab)
Yes.
Yes, especially after my sis was born. When I was a teen I kept wishing I could have been her instead. 

Then afterwards it was seeing younger cis women in their 20‚Äôs. THAT hit me the hardest. Both jealousy from how young and pretty they were to knowing, ‚Äúdamn that could/should have been me.‚Äù

It took a long time to make it past those thoughts. Occasionally it still gets me. But there‚Äôs nothing I can do, except try and be who I am now. Not who I wished I could have been.
I‚Äôve become ruthless about letting go of things that don‚Äôt serve me, and jealousy doesn‚Äôt.
I'm glad I'm nothing like my selfish sister.


My cousins on the other hand....they are gorgeous and I wish I could have been any one of them.
I've never had this. Im the second oldest of 5 (2 boys) and I'm the only trans one (but my 12 year old sibling is dropping hints that they're at least NB). Im like 12 years older than my brother and he was just a baby when I came out and I started transitioning before he hit puberty. (I accidently chose his middle name as my name i had no idea üôà). I've never felt jealous... Thats his life and it has nothing to do with me and how he treats his gender identity isn't gonna impact me. If he wasn't born a boy I'd still be trans. This might be different if I was one of the younger kids tho, I could totally see how jealousy would form if I could see my brother grow up into what I wanted before I could start my transition.
I can relate
Not really resentful but definitely very jealous of my sister. I find myself wishing ""Why couldn't I be just like you?""
I started ttansition at 29 almost 30 anfd sometimes it gets bad but sometimes i do pass and i sometimes wish that i had started early
Ummm not really towards family when I see some girls(hope this don‚Äôt sound weird or creepy) but I do get bit envy of them cuz of them being a girl and having a nice feminine body that I wish I had
I get jealous of most women i see period
got the same situation going on with the dad/step mom having a baby brother atm, and i just feel like shit. im so jealous. its not my dads/stepmoms nor the babies fault, but it still hurts so much. i wish that was me.
Everyday! Happens with friends too
Yes especially in public
Yup I always feel bad when I do, its just sometimes I just get so fucking \[\[gender envy\]\]   
I very much do not dislike my family it's just something that happens
Honestly yes,all the time. It's maddening when I have to struggle so hard to pass and have media and the world around me question my very right to be alive. It's toxic,but I do look at cis women but blissfully living my best life. Literally just BORN with everything I could ever want. I daydream of everyone in the world swapping gender overnight,just so they would learn some empathy on that dysphoria feels like.
It's normal what you're feeling however.. but.. when we feel jealous.. I think it's important to just aknowledge it and feel it for what it is. Try to focus on being grateful. I've met so many strong people who wish they were born with all their limbs, or without severe disability. Some people don't have all their senses. I get jealous too.. could it have been better? Absolutely..but it could be worse too . Everyone has things they dislike about themselves, and Earth is all RNG anyway. Nobody got to create their character in this bothersome game.
I get it when I see other trans girls breasts...or just breasts in general...the jealousy is OVERWHELMING because although I do have breasts, they're tubular and look weird. Like Oh great of course I'd get the short stick
ive always been jealous of my brother for being born cis, but since we grew up in the same room as kids i got to try ""boy"" games, clothes and hobbies that i wouldn't have had the chance to try if we weren't as close... im still really thankful for the freedom being close to him gave me, but the jealousy of seeing him grow into the man i always dreamt of being really hurt.
Starting HRT made this feeling worse for me. But as my body has started to change its gotten better.   Also at 23 you still have a very good chance to pass after some time. I just try to keep telling myself it's not too late and to be grateful I figured this out as early as I did (I definitely had the feeling as a kid but living in a rual area didn't give me any support to figure out who I was) . I was 25 when I started so don't loose hope! It's not consistent yet (voice consistently is hard lol) but I'm starting to pass quite often after 6 months of hrt.

And I know therapy isn't the only answer but feelings like I missed my child/teen years, wanting to carry my child, and other super toxic thoughts that transition hasn't helped me with are definitely getting overwhelming. I hope I can find someone I feel comfortable talking about these things too but finding a therapist who is good and affordable is impossible üòë

i think this happens with everyone. pretty sure that most trans people wish they had realized and came out earlier no matter if they did at 10 or 30. I‚Äôm 18 (i came out at 17) and i always wish i knew what i was feeling as a young kid like some of the trans people i know.
I transitioned at 24 (28 now) and the best way I cope is just trying to put it into perspective. There's always a bigger fish. There's always someone who's going to transition earlier, be prettier, and get to live more of their lives as their true selves.

4-5 years ago, 24 was considered pretty young to start, now different places are granting teens puberty blockers, and transitioning before you're 20 is the ""new young transitioning age"".

My brother is a transboy (only 15) and he's busting to start, but has a myriad of physical and mental health problems preventing it. I wish he read this stuff and realised his time isn't running out, he's got heaps more to look forward to. 

You do you at your own pace. We can't go faster than our own limits and we shouldn't punish ourselves for that.
I'm even jealous of people who start late and have significant breast growth 3 months in...

Here I am a year and a half in with nothing.
I've had to work against those same feelings for different things.  What helps me is reminding myself that there are people who are older wishing they could have done xyz in their 20s.  We still have our youth.

And I wish someone had told me this sooner so I wasn't feeling jealous of kids who had a better roll of the die as long as I have.
There‚Äôs always an odd man out.
One of my best friends from HS is a trans woman. She came out in our 20s. And me in late 30s. When I told her about me, she didnt understand at all! She's like but you're everything I ever wanted to be! I totally understand, bc I felt the same about her for a while.
It's not passing in general I'm worried about. It's about passing effortlessly without any makeup, to be able to put on a pair of jeans and a t-shirt and still look unquestionably female, to be able to fit cis women's clothing and not have this huge rectangular rib cage. I know passing is very possible for me, maybe even without make up since I don't have a *super* masculine face as it is, but I don't want to have to put in effort for it, I just want to *be*. Again, I know passing shouldn't be what's important, and I know this isn't a healthy mindset to have, but I'm just not sure how to get over it.

Yeah, no country seems to have figured out mental health care yet. I hope you find what you're looking for soon ‚ù§Ô∏è You can DM me if you want, cause I really relate to a lot of that
Trans people have a good chance of ‚Äúpassing‚Äù outside of their 20‚Äôs, regardless. 

I started at 36. Hormones have done me well. Ffs will carry me the rest of the way.
I'm 28 haven't started yet and there are many people on r/TransLater who are even older and at various stages of transition journey.
Thank you ‚ù§Ô∏è I was never very thoughtful about my gender as a kid, and I didn't understand the sudden onset of depression and brain fog in my teen years to be dysphoria, so I don't know how my parents would have reacted had I come out to them then. As it is, I came out to them last year, and they just didn't believe me cause they never noticed any ""signs"" when I was younger and just invalidated everything I said. I'm so sorry you had to go through that and worse at 13! I hope you're better and stronger now because of it. I'm hoping to be able to start HRT within the next few months, so now I'm just praying for good genes üôè

I wish you all the best ‚ù§Ô∏è
I found that just telling yourself over and over again that your troubles aren't important and they are just unhealthy isn't going to help. Because it is very normal to feel like that. I feel you there on a painfully personal level. Not in my 20s yet but due to a lot of situations and circumstances I really have, genuinely no idea whenever I'd even get in a situation to be able to apply for any HRT treatment, and even though friends praise my rare selfies that I'm brave enough to share, looking at my body from shoulders to toe I'm a lot of the time just, scared, from the thought that I may never get anything close to what I want
But you know, I just want to tell you this to kinda give you context of where I am coming from. Point is, telling yourself that the way you feel is not right and you have to get over it is what I tried for ages to no avail. I think that the best way to say it is simply you have to accept that you feel like this. Those are your feelings, very natural feelings that humans have, and feeling like that is just a part of you. Don't resent those feelings just, accept how they are a thing, try to avoid situations where it could be getting too intense, and when the situation requires it try to put them to the side, but at the end of the day you can easily acknowledge ""man I was kinda jealous of that person"". Heck, if you have people you can trust, you can maybe try and confide in them. See what they can tell you about it, I promise a true friend would never deflect your heart's pains as ""just a negative mindset""

Sorry if what I said was too much too sudden I just, really related to what you said here and a tiny part of me was just wishful that whatever I have to say may be able to ease your pain a bit
You give me hope at 28 hoping to start in next few years.
Thank you. That really does help a lot ‚ù§Ô∏è It's nice to have those feelings validated a bit, cause I see so much discourse around those types of feelings ""perpetuating misogyny"" and there's nothing more to it. Although I do agree it's important not to set impossible goals for yourself, it's hard to shake the feeling that those goals *were* once realistic for me, but the chance was stolen from me. I just need to be able to feel that without feeling guilty.
You queen are valid as fuck, and so are your feelings <3 so yeah I wish you as successful of a HRT as possible it is
Thank you so so much üò≠ been having a pretty shit time lately as well, so I really needed this ‚ù§Ô∏è

I wish you all the best, girlie üíã

Anger	"Last year I discovered that I'm trans. I didn't know about the harassment, discrimination, exclusion and violence towards us, so it was quite shocking when I found out about it. I was sad, hopeless and I didn't defend myself when I decided to come out to my family. 
However, these last 3 months I started to feel anger instead of sadness, indignation instead of anxiety and it's pushing me towards defend myself and act, tell people MY pronouns or correct them when they missgender me, show my indignation when I see some injustice happen to one of our trans folks. I don't know if anyone else relates to these changes in their feelings, but it'd be nice to know that I'm not the only one going through this.

Love you all üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüíñüåπ"	"Honestly, same kinda.

I used to have loads of patience for it all. Tried talking things through with people for years, always hoping they'd see my side of things.

Didn't work. Now I'm angry.

I still give people the benefit of the doubt, and if they seem receptive to learning, I'll give them a lot of time and leeway. But if someone starts arguing with me about it, they can bite me and choke on it.
I try not to be antagonistic toward cis folks. I don't think the majority of them are ill-intentioned. With family and friends it can be different, because sometimes they think your gender expression is a reflection on them. So they may say more hurtful things. But most cis strangers are live and let live types. Maybe I'm wrong.

üòä
Love to see the power arc! We fight for our siblings who haven't yet found their voice. Keep up the good fight fren, there are many who appreciate it üíñ
Yep, I‚Äôve never had much sadness do I went straight to being angry at the fuckers
I say correct them, but be nice at first. There are people with oppositional defiance that feel like if you are coming at them hard they will refuse to be compliant at all. If they still refuse then by all means tear into them. I know it sucks always having to be the nice person and the one taking all the shit, but acceptance of us is growing each year. Things are getting better.
I needed this. I'm building towards coming out to a person who is definitely not supportive.
I absolutely agree. I was a mild person before I came out and I‚Äôd like to think I‚Äôm still very level headed, but I never get more angry than I do when I see/hear transphobia, directed at me or otherwise. You‚Äôre not alone, and I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre standing up for yourself :)
I had this realization a while back and it was really frustrating. For me, before that, I was so freaking happy to figure out that I was actually a girl. When the anger came, I realized that the best way to channel it, at least in my perspective, is to try to work to change it. I am really upset at cisheteronormativity, at the patriarchy, and most especially, at religion, but it‚Äôs not time to give in and hang our heads. We can work to change the world. I truly think the progress of history is on our side. We just need to survive. So now I want to focus all my frustration into doing something to help others in our positions. I want to run a cafe/shelter for lgbtq+ and other at risk folks, especially young people rejected by family and friends
 I always try to avoid anger because it‚Äôs something I‚Äôve had issues with in the past. Despite that, I am frustrated by how we‚Äôre treated in society. However, we still need to try and be patient and respectful. There are too many on both sides who‚Äôll lash out and hurt others, and we‚Äôre trying to be accepting.

Basically, it‚Äôs a good thing to be angry about it. Things *need* to change. Correct others, show your indignation about mistreatment, and absolutely defend yourself! Just try not to hurt anyone by acting rashly.

Love you too!
I love this! Same here. We have to keep showing up for our community when we are able. Sometimes it seems no one else will üíï.
I only avoid anger because I knew what it was like to be ignorant in the past. Towards purposefully transphobic people I have had this progression though. I'm not gonna take shit from people with below average iqs. But I try to stay calm and remind myself that I could very well be one of the only openly trans person this person meets- and I don't want to cause transphobia because I'm irritated.
Maybe not knowing was a good thing. Too many trans ppl have to hide their true selves out of fear, you didn't. This made it possible for you to have the strength and will to defend your trans brothers and sisters. 

Good on you for fighting for not just yourself, but those who have not found ur strength. Some may never feel ur strength and will need you. 

Be you, protect yourself first and, if it's safe, stick up for those who can't, but don't ever put yourself in danger if u can avoid it. 

Hell, maybe politics or political activism could be in ur future.
lol y'all are cool,  
Anytime my dad says anything negative about trans people i just sorta act like I didn't hear him and wasn't paying attention. (not out that diddle dang closet yet lol)   
or i just sorta slip away to my room.  


also to the 2 friends i am out too there's no way I'm gonna correct them about pro-nouns or whatever.

My best friend was dead-named at her funeral.	"This is my first time on this subreddit and my best friend, Eliza, hung out here a lot. She passed away last Monday of cancer and I miss her so much. I‚Äôm currently watching the Facebook Live because unfortunately I can‚Äôt travel 5 hours to see her one last time. Her father always worked against her in every way possible: being an active member of transphobic organizations, refusing to call her by her name, and only using her existence to look good. Ellie was the best at managing her anger when it came to her father. But, even to the very end, her father dressed her in a suit and doesn‚Äôt even memorialize her true self. No one at the funeral truly talked about her, it was just a standard Catholic mass. 

The livestream just ended abruptly as they carried her casket out to the car. The way they filmed everything was just... cult-like. They aren‚Äôt streaming the burial.

Edit 1: Thank you everyone so much for your kind words and encouragement ü•∫ it means the world to all of us grieving her departure.

Edit 2: A friend who went to the funeral in-person sent a picture.
[Here lies Eliza, the Red Panda Queen.](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/mz74fm/rest_well_bestie_our_red_panda_queen_3_well_keep/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=iossmf)

Edit 3: I just learned he defaced her by putting her in a suit AND making it a closed casket service. He did this for himself.

Edit 4: silver AND wholesome? ü•∫"	"That is so aweful. I don't have words.
One of the reasons I'm going to request a viking style burial in my will (so it'll be legally binding if notorized) so I can have those who would take care of it skip the price and just burn me atop a mass of wood and have a sort of party in my memory. No occult shit, no formalities, no religion. Just the few friends I have partying in my memory.
That's the kind of infuriating erasure of trans lives that inspires people to go to her grave and ""vandalize"" that shit. To etch her real name into the tombstone. To slap Trans pride stickers on it and leave flowers in pink and blue and white. To place photos of her during her life as proof of who she was. To remember the family and curse their graves forevermore for trying to hide who Eliza was. If they wouldn't stream where she was buried, it could be because they KNOW what they are doing would be objected to and something would be done about it. That part of the whole mess is doubly sickening. How COWARDLY they are in their hatred of trans people.
It feels like Ellie was with us for such a short time. She was strong, so strong. A true warrior, she understood that fighting with those who will never seek peace leads only to mutual destruction, and that sometimes the bravest act of defiance is to lay down one‚Äôs weapons and refuse to be a part of that destruction.

How beautiful she must have been to shine so brightly for her light to pierce all that darkness that surrounded her.  Even in death she is strong: they tried to erase her memory, as if she never existed, yet here we are thinking of her. Her light still shines through your stories and remembrances of her, and you honor her by sharing them. Now others can keep her memory alive as well. Her spirit is still with us.
What a piece of shit (the father), Goddamn that's sad.
This breaks my heart. I had a friend who passed last year and I wasn't able to attend the funeral because her parents refused to acknowledge her name or gender. They also threatened legal action against anyone who used her name in any publication. It made mourning really fucking tough.

I'm sending you all the fortitude and love I can. You can still honor her and remember her the way she wanted to be remembered.
I'm so sorry!! That is the biggest insult they could possibly give her. I hope she knew somehow that you would speak for her here... and be true to her after she passed.  I hope you are okay,  and if you need to talk, feel free to let me know.
Eliza will live on forever in our hearts.
This is a shockingly common story, and I'm sorry you, your friends, and Eliza have to deal with this.

Care for our dead is one of the places we're going to need to push hard on. This is a disgrace every time it happens.

I hope you and yours are coping well. Take care of yourselves.
I couldn't help but cry at this. I'm Soo sorry for your loss
The is one of the main reasons I refuse to let my depression/dysphoria convince me to kill myself. Because I know my family will do this sort of thing to my dead self.
Her dad is a cunt and should have taken her place suffering, atleast she is in heaven now and can rest easy having a party in the great beyond. Its things like this that make me hope there's an afterlife.
That makes me sick. I'm so, so sorry.
I'm so sorry for your loss. Even if her family won't, we'll remember her for how she was.
I have no words, that seems so awful
There is a [video on YT by Caitlin Doughty](https://youtu.be/PVgumSUZQRI) which deals with exactly this kind of stuff.
It might be helpful (depending on where you live) for the folks here.
Spread the message, stop the bs.
Much love to Ellie. She deserves so much love and respect. You‚Äôre a good friend to her and it is so painful that she was not treated the way she should‚Äôve been at the end.
That's horrible.  As if her passing wasn't bad enough. ü§∑üòø
I mean I can‚Äôt say how I‚Äôd feel if it happened to me(since I‚Äôd be dead) but if I knew that were to happen to me I‚Äôd be destroyed. Oh my lord words can‚Äôt express how wrong this is and how bad I feel for her and you.
I'm so sorry..can I kindly go stab that guy with a spoon?
I am actually crying right now. You need to confront her father or something and tell him he is a piece of shit.
What.The.Hell.
I... I have no words for this.I'm so sorry about everything.
This is rad as hell, I love this.

Your will is not sufficient to ensure postmortem treatment in the United States. Typically, your will won't even be opened and read until *after* your funeral. The document you want depends on the state you live in, but you'll either want an actively updated *living* will, as well as appointing someone medical power of attorney over you. 

To cover your bases, you'll also want to fill out a document called "" Appointment of Agent to Control Disposition of Remains"" and have *that* notarized. I believe this would be sufficient in most, if not all, states.

In all of these cases, you'll need to give the power to someone you trust. It's also helpful to have your arrangements pre-planned and, if possible, paid for.

If you're willing to share where you live with me, I can help you find what documents you'll need. I'm not a lawyer, but I work in the funeral industry.
Ikr
I honestly didn‚Äôt think about this part of the end. The edit on the post saddened me and infuriated me, it made me realize that if something were to happen to me I would be in the same situation. I am seeing this life through to the end to make sure that doesn‚Äôt happen to me and help those who can not stand up for themselves. Not sure how yet but I‚Äôll figure it out.
If I wasn‚Äôt so emotionally vulnerable right now, I would‚Äôve done my absolute fucking best to change the circumstances.
Hi so sorry for your loss, I'm Dad! :)

A therapist	"I have a therapist that refuses to call me my correct name and pronouns. It's hard to explain in english cause all of this happened in Poland, but I'll try. He basically says that I feel offended and harmed when he's deadnaming me, but i'm reality there is no harm done to me. ""What if calling you he/him pronouns and your chosen name make ME uncomfortable? Maybe let's compromise and I'll keep calling you *deadname* and you call yourself whatever you want?"" And when I asked him why would he feel uncomfortable he said something like ""see, now you feel offended and you have anger towards me, and you're making a conflict."" Is he transphobic, or am I losing my mind? I'm so confused"	"No this is transphobic lmao I hate this argument cause my parents use it but it‚Äôs so stupid like sure whatver you have the choice to do whatver you want, but that doesn‚Äôt change the fact that I‚Äôm most comfortable going by a name I have chosen as more fitting for me. If you refuse to call me that I have the right to be uncomfortable and not want to interact with you. 

It‚Äôs just such a stupid argument like because basically they want to spin our own argument against us but it‚Äôs just not the same, ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not doing that I‚Äôm not comfortable, let‚Äôs compromise by me being okay with what you call yourself!‚Äù Like no that‚Äôs the bare minimum lmao.
That ‚Äúcompromise‚Äù doesn‚Äôt fix my uncomfortableness,it only fixes the the other person‚Äôs uncomfortableness so if we can‚Äôt find a real middle ground then maybe we shouldn‚Äôt talk.
Each middle ground is also different depending on the person.

Tldr: in my opinions he‚Äôs transphobic or Atleast not suited to treat a transgender patient and would recommend getting a new therapist
Transphobic. Never go back to him.
I'm sorry to hear that, that's a terrible therapist. Please find a new one that'll respect your gender identity. There are some therapists who specialize in dealing with gender dysphoria and just guiding you through your transition in general. Better if you look for those
Or sounds like conversion therapy to me. How did you find this therapist?
Lol he is def transphobic and a gaslighting asshole. I recommend finding a therapist with an actual understanding of gender and ditching this bum. 

You don't owe him anything (except money) but as a therapist he owes you a safe evnviorment and that can't happen when he deadnames and misgenders you.
Throw that whole man in the trash
Oh no, not this argument. It's the horrible loop of your boundary breaks my boundary! It's a way to make you feel guilty for asking him to do something for you. That not healthy behavior let alone something a therapist should say to you. Please find someone who will listen to you and won't try and guilt you when tell them your uncomfortable.
Ask him if he would like being called she, and by the wrong name, and if he would take it as respectful if it bothered you to call him the correct name/pronouns. Just use what he's using on you, it's not fair he said that. Either way, if what he wants does not work for you and does not help you in therapy, then just leave.
FIND A NEW THERAPIST IMMEDIATELY
Your therapist went out of his way to call you something he knew would affect your mental state and then gaslit you when you asked why his feelings are more important than yours.

This guy is not only a transphobe but also a pretty fucking shit therapist.
He is transphobic. You aren't crazy. Change therapists and report/leave a review if possible
at your next session present him a copy of the [WPATH standards of care in polish](https://www.wpath.org/media/cms/Documents/SOC%20v7/SOC%20V7_Polish.pdf?_t=1573660119) and ask him to read them and make necessary adjustments. if he refuses, get another therapist. keep a copy for yourself regardless.
He's transphobic and gaslighting you. ""Asking someone to explain why they feel that way"" is not ""making a conflict"", it's literally how you resolve a conflict.

You need a new therapist. Transphobia aside - a therapist who wants you to just put up with being uncomfortable without even asking people to explain their stances is not a good therapist.
Yikes that‚Äôs horrible

You should start calling him like idk Jessica and when he gets offended use the same backasswards logic he‚Äôs using (I‚Äôm kinda joking here lol)

In all seriousness if you can get a new therapist do so, he can‚Äôt be good for your mental health
If this is from a therapist definitely find a new one. Toxic asshole should have any license he has to practice therapy taken away. From what I've heard Poland isn't the most accommodating place for trans folk so I'm not surprised and there's probably little you can do but go to someone else, to be honest I'd say you're better off being your own therapist in this situation

Edit. Said this without direct research but after some it sounds the same as every other country bar a couple. They don't want us to get attacked, but won't support or help if we do is the general theme I see across most of the world
Yes he's fucking transphobic. Get a new therapist. As someone who's been in therapy 10 years and who's parents both work in mental health(and have my whole life)a therapist should NEVER say shit like that. They should never invalidate your feelings. I'm having trouble putting it into words but you get my point.
Actually, there been studies that racial slurs have a dramatic mental impact on an individual who hears them(slurs that are targeted towards them) 

It‚Äôs not too much of a stretch to think that something like dead naming and Misgendering can have the same effect on trans people. 

[this isn‚Äôt the study I was looking for, but it still gets the point across](https://www.pfizer.com/news/articles/understanding_racial_microaggression_and_its_effect_on_mental_health)
Gross. Absolutely disgusting. So if I use the n-word, to refer to a black woman that‚Äôs /her/ problem. Same logic.
Find a new therapist
This is so terrible I‚Äôm so sorry. You need to find a new therapist and honestly I would report him or review him or whatever you need to do. This is transphobic af and you have a right to be called the correct pronouns and name. I‚Äôm sorry for your experience
Feminize his name. Refer to him with she/her pronouns. Call it a ‚Äúcompromise.‚Äù See how he likes it and how long it‚Äôll take for him to feel uncomfortable and have a conversation with you about it.
regardless of if it‚Äôs transphobic (it is) it‚Äôs incredibly unprofessional
yeah... he's being transphobic. He is a therapist. If something as trivial as saying ""he"" instead of ""her"" is making him ""uncomfortable"" he is in the wrong line of work. Trying to deflect it back on you with lines like ""now you have anger towards me and you're making a conflict"" is a guilt redirection tactic. It's like when a villain in a movie is holding someone at gunpoint and is trying to make this big point to the hero about how ""the hero will be the one who killed the hostage"". To be blunt, yes there is conflict in this situation and yes you are involved in that conflict, but you are **NOT** the one making it. Your 'therapist' is the one who is drawing the line in the sand and giving you no option but to cross that line and then trying to say it's your fault for crossing the line. I would find another therapist and fast.
Not only should you ditch this guy, he needs to have his job taken away. And I would consider complaining about him if you can find a way. He‚Äôs being the opposite of helpful- even if he‚Äôs not fully aware of how to handle a trans patient, he should at least know what NOT to do. Sadly, I hooked up with a therapist before who on the very first session, told me I should ‚Äúbe accepting‚Äù when people don‚Äôt use my name and pronouns. Never returned to his office.
Transphobic and lot of gaslight
He‚Äòs transphobic and you should get a new therapist asap.  

His claim makes only sense if he believes trans people don‚Äòt exist and don‚Äòt experience their life differently than their agab.
Find a new therapist ASAP and report him if you‚Äôre able to. He did this because he‚Äôs transphobic but if he as a therapist is angry over a patient setting boundaries, he is not a safe therapist. You are probably not the first person he has treated this way and he most likely has a pattern of this.

See a new therapist. He's not only being transphobic but outright gaslighting you. Someone like that shouldn't have a license.
Oh my goodness. He is trying to manipulate you so badly. Please leave him. The goal of therapy is for YOU to express yourself freely. What he's doing, is turning you into the problem when in reality he's the only one ""offended"" and ""making a conflict"". GRoSS
He‚Äôs transphobic. Get a different therapist
That‚Äôs not a compromise, that‚Äôs just your therapist getting what he wants.
Turn it back on him. Use a feminine name and she/her pronouns for him, and maybe he will also get offended. It‚Äôs such an old and transphobic argument that is so easily overturned by the fact that this transphobic person also has a name and pronouns that they want to use, and get upset and weirded out when those aren‚Äôt used for them. I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you, in therapy no lessüòû
You need to get another therapist and record him to the offical point of contact like psychologists association or something (if that's possible in Poland)
Start calling him a transphobe and say it makes you more comfortable to refer to him that way.
Wow, your therapist is doing the literal opposite of his job.  If you can, try and find a new one. And report him if you can, I don't know Poland's laws around therapy or trans acceptance.
Imagine applying this logic to a cis person. ‚ÄúYes you said your name was Bob, but biologically you‚Äôre Robert. It makes me uncomfortable to call you Bob so I‚Äôll call you Robert and you can call yourself Bob.‚Äù
You obviously should get a new therapist who isn't transphobic, but if you have to see him again why not just come up with a new name and set of pronouns to refer to him. If he objects say very kindly and sweetly ""I'm just more comfortable using this name for you, you can still call yourself whatever you want, so there shouldn't be any problem""
ask him how being transphobic to his client and going against established science helping his client and does not constitute malpractice. Tell him you are not being offended, you are disappointed that a licensed professional denies the accepted consensus on how to treat transgender people.
Ask him why shouldn't you make a complaint for malpractice and why his license shouldn't be revoked.
This is really bad. Not just because he's deadnaming, but also because he's dismissing your concerns by putting it back on you, effectively blaming you for having the gall to ask that he explain himself. I hope you can find someone else...
Time for a new therapist. Write an email to their supervisor if there is one. If not. Switch. That‚Äôs bad therapist.

He‚Äôs gaslighting you.
That is a transphobic piece of sentient faces masquerading as a therapist.

Name them and shame them publicly, report them to any governing body you can for discrimination, and never ever go back to them.

What a vile person...
Your therapist needs therapy.
Yeah, the whole point of a therapist is to be understanding so he can better understand your condition, not fly off the handles like a madman. I recommend switching therapists if that is an option
He sounds pretty transphobic to me
Ditch him!
yep definitely trasphobic. i second everything other people have said and would also like to add that he's your therapist aka a medical professional and you're his patient so it's completely inappropriate to prioritise your his feelings over your health
Get a new therapist, it sounds like he's not qualified for therapy. Therapists should put their clients first in almost every case (the exceptions being when the client is likely to harm themselves or others like pretty much all therapist are obliged to report). He's not doing that, so he shouldn't be your therapist, or anyone else's for that matter.
Your therapist should never say they‚Äôre uncomfortable around you, or do things to make you uncomfortable. Find a new one as soon as you can or look to online resources if they‚Äôre available to you
That seems like a weird and transphobic overstep to me. You can try setting a boundary by saying ""I have changed my name to {name} and my pronouns to {pronouns} and if you say the wrong ones, I will correct you. If you are unwilling to call me the correct name and pronouns, I will have to seek a new therapist.
transphobic af
Find a new therapist, if he doesn't respect you then he is not going to help you in any way shape or form, and it could affect your mental health as well as the way you view yourself.
The gaslighting is crazy from this therapist
Transphobe for sure  get a referral to a different therapist  and then report him to the ethics board for malpractice.
That is manipulative, victim blaming, disregarding your feelings, gaslighting, and I dont know what else.  That person shouldn't have a license. Please seek a new therapist. This person is not trying to help you, and will only cause harm.
 That's a garbage therapist, no way around it. Especially the ''you should accommodate my feelings'' part, this is not something a therapist should ever ask of their patient outside of asking for basic respect.

 The second his and your worldviews clash in a way that makes therapy uncomfortable or less effective, the second he should have referred you to another therapist more suited to your needs. This is literally part of their training.
He‚Äôs transphobic, never go back to him and file a complaint against him with the boards overseeing his license.

Because fuck him, his ego is supposed to take a backseat to your mental weep being, he‚Äôs an absolute ahole.
This is Poland, very transphobic and homophobic country (in general ofc not saying that everyone in poland is like that).

anyone else getting downvoted for NO reason?	it's like, the second i make a post on a different subreddit stating my opinion on a transgender related issue (that has to do with the subreddit topic) as well and stating i'm trans, i get downvoted. for example i made a post on an ED forum (filled to the brim with cis girls) saying that people should stop comparing a mental illness to being trans because it's not that comparable. and every comment i made replying to someone got downvoted. for example, just so you know how trivial it is, my comment saying body dysphoria and body dysmorphia aren't interchangeable got downvoted, when i was correcting someone. like what, are you serious? was i not right? i was stating facts. i wasn't being rude either at all. i'm never rude when trying to educate. honestly so pissed right now and this was NOT the first time it happened. i deleted the post now because i'm not trying to anger all the cis women or whatever. but jesus, do these people not know anything about being transgender at all? i wasn't reaching in the post, that forum is (or at least was) full of people bringing up trans people in comparison to people with eating disorders, when it's not the same at all. sure we both have body image issues but you're not supposed to recover from being trans and accept yourself as your AGAB. so i made a post about it. i wasn't whining or being sensitive either, i was talking about how it made me feel a little weird. boom downvotes. well, whatever next time i'll just shut up üò¨üò¨ since obviously these cisgender women know it better	"Oh I just don't give a shit about downvotes this website is a cesspool and nobody's opinion on what I say gets to me
Happend to me quite a few times. I just stopped interacting with all subbredits that aren't LGBT+ related. Dealing with bigots is not worth the damage they do to my mental health.
Weirdly I get the same thing. Even when I'm not talking about trans stuff. Like when I post a question on r/askreddit.
Yeah no cis people don't actually like when we talk
All the time. Usually with a heaping handful of comments about how my point of view is invalid because I‚Äôm trans (or just accusations of being a child predator and the like).
It‚Äôs not you, people have the power to downvote for no reason.  A differing opinion will get you downvotes. People aren‚Äôt as supportive or accepting  online as they lead you to believe.  I‚Äôve learned this is just Reddit and it sucks
[deleted]
Just learn not to give a fuck and live as your truest self regardless of what others say :)
There are very many trolls on this website. Ive also noticed it on other LGBT related posts that aren't in LGBT subs.
Some subs are really transphobic. Clean up in the endometriosis sub is a wip, too.
I had a back and forth with some misinformed person on a different subreddit who thought that not allowing teenagers to transition was somehow ‚Äúprotecting‚Äù them. They talked down to me about how what I was saying was ‚Äúdangerous‚Äù and ‚Äúonly thinking of their physical effects‚Äù when in reality is much safer to transition early than it is to go through puberty before transitioning, and it literally goes without saying that a persons emotional state will be only helped by the transition. I feel like I‚Äôve got some things to unload here from the encounters I‚Äôve had with these uneducated people.
It depends on what subreddit you do it on. A lot of non-trans subs are very supportive, but a lot also aren't.
I mean, it's not really NO reason.  It's a simple reason: they hate us.

I stopped caring what others think of me years ago. üòÇüòÇüòÇ I understand your frustration but if you show them that they are getting to you then they will never stop. That's a sad fact of life unfortunately. We will give you all the upvotes here though! ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§

P.S. The day I stopped caring has a story behind it üòÇüòÇüòÇ
that's a really good mentality, i should probably stop caring as well. i always get worked up over it
ngl it honestly feels weird and a little scary to state that you're lgbt outside of safe space subreddits... you never know the hate wave that you could get if you happen to post in the wrong community
Same. I just said in a local area subreddit that you should tip the people who make your coffee if you can and got a surprisingly negative response lol
yeah, you're right... i wouldn't say those people were all straight up transphobic, but they didn't want to listen for whatever reason they had. i wasn't attacking or ""calling out"" anyone, it's not like the entirety of the subreddit made that comparison and now i'm calling them jerks, but they still felt the need to ""disagree""
>how my point of view is invalid because I‚Äôm trans

lmfao i love when people do that

""you're trans and talking about trans issues. you're obviously uneducated because you're trans""
i'm sorry you ever had to go through that. remember that they are saying those things to make you feel bad on purpose, and no one's point of view on transgender issues is more valid than trans people's. they think they're the smartest in the room for bringing up the same stupid stereotype. trans people should stick together always and use the very beneficial block feature online
sorry, i can't really understand your point in the first paragraph. could you explain it again please? it would be appreciated
well duh... they should do better then
Reddit is also a very toxic place in general l find lol. Nobody likes to see a comment disagree with them
Definitely agree, its really scary especially if that hate is given in an environment that you had once felt safe in.
[removed]
you basically just said i get downvoted because others are transphobic, which surprisingly i am already aware of... :| did you even read the post? my comments that had absolutely nothing to do with an opinion but were just facts got downvoted too

i guess that's on my fault because i didn't want to call them straight up transphobic. but it does get concerning when everything i say gets downvoted because i happen to be trans and the cis people happen to disagree for no reason (unless... you know).

It feels like cis people are fine with us as long as we're not successful or visible.	"There's a lot of anger I'm experiencing today that I don't know where to put.

I'm still mad about what happened to Isabel Fall. I'm angry that people doxx us the second we stand up for our own rights. I'm pissed off about every cis person suddenly becoming an endocrinologist the second a trans woman wins an event.

As long as we hide and they don't have to see us everything is fucking hunky-dory. That's how I understand it was in the eighties --- woodwork yourself into oblivion so no cis person has to experience the unbearable indignity of being in line behind a person who's obviously trans. And God help you if you're also gay, which like half of us are.

I try to understand where, precisely, the anger is coming from where something like this happens. Behind anger there usually lies fear. I think that's the key. I like science fiction. I like lifting weights. I'm trying to be fit enough to run a triathlon some day. I should not have to risk being the main character of the internet for a day for pursuing my fucking hobbies. Perhaps that's an unfounded fear. But I can't shake it from my mind. It's happened to my friends. It could be me tomorrow.

The worst part is that I have absolutely no idea what I can do about it. It just feels like this is the way the world is."	"If you feel safe and able to be visible, be visible. It's how we'll end up winning - by showing people we're just people like they are.

I am looking at Lia Thomas, perfectly represents the situation you are talking about
I think some people are just lazy. They want the gold star for going through the motions and waving flags in support. They don't actually want to do anything to change anything or relate to anyone as a real person.

I'm getting all my paperwork sorted out and after wasting so much time explaining structural discrimination and discrimination to people and have it go in one ear and out the next after this is done my being trans has nothing to do with them. It's simply not going to be a talking point and they have no right to know or ask questions or get a  free education on my time. That means energy can be saved for discussing important things with people who matter and get things done.
Imagine saying all cis people are transphobic.
It‚Äôs more like cis people are fine with us as long as we‚Äôre unsuccessful, invisible, or dead.
Exactly what I'm referring to.
Where do you see the word all? Show me, I must have missed it. Or you're just completely ignoring the fucking point.
There is no all, but in the title ypu said cis, not some, just cis, if you wanted people to be able to distinguish that, you should've written some.
I'm not OP. I'm just saying OP didn't claim ""all cis people"".
I still dont know why youre trying to start fights ovet this, like what are you going to get out of this, but OP should've distinguished ""all"" from ""some""
I wasn't referring to individual cis people. I was referring to the social group in the abstract.

I also didn't claim that all cis people are anything. I said I *felt like* something. Feelings don't have to be rational.
What fucking social group were you reffering too?

I knew my parents were transphobic (rant)	"I feel bad for only posting rants on this sub but I haven't really had any good things to say since my egg cracked.

So today I was talking with my family about political stuff and at one point my mom said something about the media slandering Trump. To which I said ""The media is typically wrong about a lot of things but Trump is still a bad president"". I then quoted the whole definition of gender craziness that happened a bit ago to explain why I thought that.

This is when things got bad. My mom said something along the lines of trans people wanting too much and being unreasonable. She also said ""If a guy can say their a girl can I say that I'm 20?"" That's when I started to get a bit mad and the conversation pretty much just turned into a nonsensical argument. 

At one point my asshole of a step dad said ""So what? Are you not a guy?"" I ignored him and kept talking. Partially out of anger from the question and partially out of fear of being outted. Anyway as I was talking he then said. ""This must be a new thing. You probably have to hang out with teenagers to understand it.""

At that point I was so unbelievably pissed that I just left the room while politely saying ""Your God doesn't exist"". Yeah I guess that was kinda out of nowhere but I know that they're huge Christians and would get upset at that.

I was thinking of coming out to my mom recently but now I know that I probably shouldn't. I guess it's good to know for sure that I'm not safe rather than wondering if I am or not.

I've been planning to move out and leave the state without keeping contact soon and many people have told me that that's a bad idea and that I ""shouldn't do that to my family"". But now I know for sure that I'm doing it. Fuck my family.

I always knew they wouldn't support me.

TLDR; I got into an argument with my parents about Trump in which they revealed that they were transphobic. Fml"	"Damn I feel you. The shit is my I'm moved out but still financially dependent. No estrogen for me anytime soon.
family aint worth shit unless theyre actually family. dont let anyone try and tell you that you need to be available to someone just cause of blood ties
You're not ""doing that to your family.""  You're doing it for yourself.  They don't support you.  You support you.  
Family isn't blood. That's an old mentality that people use to control others. Family is the people you choose to surround yourself with, the people who have chosen to be part of your life. 

Love without empathy is just control.

'your god doesn't exist' will be my new catchphrase
Family always love to talk about how important ‚Äúblood‚Äù is (i.e. how important family is), but as soon as you do something they don‚Äôt like they treat you like garbage and then go into a craze when you stand up for yourself and defend yourself saying something along the lines of ‚Äúfamily is important. Never go against the family.‚Äù BITCH WHAT?!?!

I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this! Seeing posts like this makes me realize just how lucky I am to have a father who went on an angry ‚Äú15-minute couch rant‚Äù about the Trump administration when he found out about their plans to re-define gender.
>You probably have to hang out with teenagers to understand it.  
  
This is what being incapable of understanding the objective nature of societal changes looks like. 
>I've been planning to move out and leave the state without keeping contact soon and many people have told me that that's a bad idea and that I ""shouldn't do that to my family""

I ditched my family for having basically the same attitude. So yea, I'm totes with you. Fuck'em, leave them behind.
It‚Äôs like the old, incredibly misunderstood aphorism; ‚Äúblood is thicker than water.‚Äù

It *doesn‚Äôt* mean that birth family must take precedence over all. The full saying is ‚Äúthe blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb,‚Äù and essentially means that the family we choose through mutual association of like-minded people means more than the family we were born into through blind chance.
Actually I do have Dissociative Identity Disorder (multiple personalities) and I consider them to be my real family. They've help me through a lot more than anyone else has.
Family is just random people you get stuck with for 18 years. They don't mean anything.

Yeah my step dad is really old. I honestly don't understand why he isn't dead yet considering he smokes and drinks like crazy.
It's so nice to hear people support that. Everyone I've told thought it was a bad idea. It made me start to reconsider but after this I know it's the right thing to do.
Wow that is radically different when you hear the whole phrase. Like ""great minds think alike"" is followed by ""...but fools rarely differ""
Your biological family doesn't care about you. Like all bio family, they care about what you represent to others, and what you can practically do for them. Cut them out emotionally before they hurt you more. Don't give them fuel to hurt you in the future.

People like this don't change
I feel this, headmates are great support 
I mean, I'll say the caveats of: Make sure you're fully financially independent of them when you cut them off. And that you're prepared to never have them as a fall back. But once you've gotten to that point, cut contact as much as possible, imo.
Yes indeed!

It‚Äôs nuts how these sayings that start out generally wise are distorted into people thinking they mean the exact opposite of their original intent.
You're probably right. Leaving them would only make my life better.

Ugh that one annoys me to no ends!"	9swmph	trans	146	0.99	2018-10-31 07:40:18
I understand. I‚Äôm sorry that it took so long.	"I‚Äôve never been very empathetic. It‚Äôs one of my worst traits. Somewhere along the line, I had allowed myself to become completely desensitized to the hardships and struggles of others. So when I heard that Chris Tyson of MrBeast would be transitioning to a woman, my initial reaction was precisely nothing. But then I read the comments.

The first thing that struck me is the ignorance. The blind distrust of the  unknown that leads people to draw the wildest conclusions with incredible leaps of logic. ‚ÄòHow can a man leave his wife and son to become a woman? What a sickening thing to do!!‚Äô, they proclaim, forgetting momentarily that fifty percent of marriages end in divorce. ‚ÄòOld Chris would be ashamed of new Chris‚Äô, they argue, as if angry that this person they had all known and loved was changing- as if some foreign entity had possessed them, as if this weren‚Äôt the same person with the same feelings they would always have felt. One wonders if perhaps they are simply angry at themselves that they may have liked somebody with views so different to their own. 

And then there‚Äôs the anger- the inexplicable, unjustifiable anger. I cannot for the life of me get my head around how someone can hold so much resentment towards a person who will most likely never know that they even exist. It must be tiring to be so full of hate. ‚ÄòChris is a walking L‚Äô, the particularly unimaginative amongst them say, and refuse to elaborate any further, limiting their replies to clown emojis in the comments. 

And then there‚Äôs the fear, which would be almost laughable if it weren‚Äôt so terrifying. The idea that somehow teaching a child distrust and hatred of difference is preferable to letting them see the reality. The idea that being trans is to be mentally ill, that for a person to choose to change their identity is somehow wrong, despite having nothing to do with absolutely anybody else. The idea that a person should be subjected to a lifetime of anxiety and depression because the alternative ‚Äòjust doesn‚Äôt sit right‚Äô with them. ‚ÄòI feel sorry for his son, that poor child‚Äôs life is going to be fucked‚Äô, they announce, speaking of a child who will be brought into a life of winning free Lamborghinis and trying different gold plated foods.

And then lastly came the fear, and my realization. The fear that this was not the minority- this was the majority. That hundreds of thousands of people agree. That ‚ÄòChris is a walking L‚Äô merited 20 thousands likes. I had never realized people were so awful. But then again, perhaps I was never looking. 

And then came the realization- that whilst I may never fully comprehend, I understand. And I despair. I despair for the people suffering with their identities who will see what awaits them, the cruelty and intolerance that many still hold. I know no one asked for my opinion, but there it is. And whilst it probably means nothing, big whoop, random guy on the internet feels empathy, I understand. I‚Äôm rooting for you and I‚Äôll do what I can. You are so incredibly strong to be yourself amidst all this opposition. I hope to loiter around here just to remind myself that there are good people out there too who support the freedom to be whoever you choose. I hope to be on your side. I‚Äôm sorry it took so long."

Thank you.  It means a lot to read that, even though I will never know or meet you IRL.  


This bit resonated with me right now ""The idea that being trans is to be mentally ill"", as I literally had a random old lady come up to me last week and snarl at me ""You're mentally ill you are!  Mentally ill!""  


I mean, yeah... they happen to be right.  As I have chronic treatment resistant depression, anxiety and a Cluster-B personality disorder as a result of my childhood and growing up keeping this all bottled up for 30+ years.  Just not for the reason they thought  >.<  


If anything, I am slowly getting happier, less depressed, less anxious and getting a better handle on my BPD all thanks to transitioning and slowly starting to see the physical changes I want, as well as the massive improvements having oestrogen instead of testosterone has done to my ability to think clearly.  And this is after only 19 months on E.  


There's a lot of damage to undo, both physical and mental, but thanks to transitioning I am actually making headway and starting to feel the changes; and feel optimistic about the future and my future happiness, for the first time in my life at 45.
It means a lot to me. Thank you for taking the time to write and post this. The only way we are going to overcome this hate and push to marginalize us is if we have people like you fighting with us. Have a great day. üñ§
It is a big whoop! 

Welcome, my friend. I hope you join us in our fight for liberation for all!

I hope your empathy extends to our folks in prisons, on the streets, those murdered by police, on reservations, the families still in cages, our children and elders, because our people are among all of those groups. Its the beautiful thing about the trans community and why I think the system fears us so much... Trans liberation is a peoples revolution. There is no way to free us without addressing all the other issues that will lead to our liberation and the liberation of all peoples.

It‚Äôs unfortunate but a lot of people not in the community don‚Äôt care until they have a moment like this. All that matters is that you‚Äôve grown from an experience.

That's important. Never forget that feeling. You DON'T know what it's like to be a minority, and honestly, that's all I want to hear from a lot of people. Understanding that you DON'T understand is so important.

&#x200B;

It's an admission that you don't lead the conversation. That's really all most transgender people want... To be heard and seen as valid. To be allowed to share our lived experiance without it being invalidated. To finally feel like Cis people have stopped saying they know our lives better than we do.

&#x200B;

Admitting that you don't really know our lives - and never truly will - is such a huge moment. I'm happy for you, honestly. Most people don't ever develop this level of self-awareness and empathy. :)
Good for you, my dude! Looks like this is a throwaway account but all good! With the current climate it might not be the safest option to back the trans community.

People who use phrases like ""a walking L"" are NPCs. Fuck 'em.

I assume this was meant with sincerity because it was massive and any support at any level will always be appreciated.

And I have no idea of your background but it's always important to remember the lament of the Germans who were eventually turned on because they simply thought differently:

First¬†they came for the socialists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was not a¬†socialist.

Then¬†they came for the trade unionists, and I did not speak out‚Äî
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was not a¬†trade unionist.

Then¬†they came for the Jews, and I did not speak out‚Äî
¬† ¬† ¬†Because I was not a¬†Jew.

Then they came for me‚Äîand there was no one left to speak for me.
Very articulate. I wish there were some way it could get to those who most need to hear it.
I truly feel this. I never really watched mr beast or knew anything about Chris prior to this, but I always knew (or so I thought) that mr beast fostered this positive and optimistic vibe to his content that transcended to his audience. NOPE, how dare I forget that I live on planet Earth, where humans are terrible and vile. 

The comments people are leaving are actually making me lose hope in humanity. It‚Äôs a whole bunch of singles, ‚Äúalphas‚Äù who probably never even been on a 2nd date, and incels leaving gross assumptions about someone and their child that they don‚Äôt know. I‚Äôm willing to bet 95% of these people don‚Äôt even have kids of their own but will suddenly act all righteous. 

Truly feel sorry for this whole situation. And what‚Äôs even worse‚Äî the people who are saying ‚ÄúI feel bad for mr beast he‚Äôs in a lose lose situation.‚Äù ‚Äî well guess what!? If people weren‚Äôt terrible and transphobic, there wouldn‚Äôt even be a ‚Äúlose lose‚Äù situation for mr beast to be in.

Pre-Disciplinary Action	"I am a non-binary school social worker in a K-5 building. A student transferred to our building and was added to my caseload. They identify as non-binary and (most of the time) use they/them pronouns. The parents are not supportive.

At their previous school, there were some behavioral concerns surrounding the frequent changing of preferred name and pronouns. To avoid these concerns at our school, I was instructed to tell this student that they had to pick a name and pronoun set and stick to it.

I stated that because I felt that this was harmful and likely to cause more behavioral concerns, I was not comfortable telling the student this. 

Silence from admin and then at the end of the day I received an email claiming that I refused a directive along with a couple of other violations. (One being that I sent an email to staff explaining the student's preferred name and pronouns and that when addressing the parents, please use the student's legal name and assigned at birth pronouns. The student had already shared this with students and staff. I wanted building support staff to understand because the secretary had already outed the student to the parents and they were very angry.)

I suspect admin is afraid of the parents and throwing me under the bus.

This whole thing has been very upsetting and I am so disappointed and angered by the treatment of this student, and, indirectly, all trans students and staff."	"I have dealt with this scenario but different. 

Remove non-binary and insert blind/deaf and its still the exact same scenario. Sadly school admins usually only care about heir own skin.

Really the BEST option is to document EVERYTHING. If admin wants to drag you down, have all the ammo and then some to make their attempts very difficult.
This is horrible, truly heartbreaking. You are amazing for sticking up for them <3
Almost the exact same thing is happening with me at school.
I‚Äôm a enby social worker who works with trans/NB folks in medical settings. This sounds like a shorty situation! I always remind myself that according to our ethics and my own values, my goal is to support my clients goals and address them how they want to be addressed in whatever situation. If they want to be addressed by dead name/assigned pronouns at birth in front of people they don‚Äôt feel safe with, cool! I‚Äôll do that! If they want me to instruct others to do the same, I‚Äôll do that! ASWB ethics also specifically name that when our ethics are being challenged by our employers, we should follow our ethics anyway, so good on you for that. Granted, sometimes that means losing our jobs. If that isn‚Äôt something you are able to do/is a risk, make sure you are taking care of yourself/making decisions with that in mind. Are you in a union? Contact them! Or organize one! 

Sorry you are going through this, friend. transphobia sucks.
Thank you for your advice. Good paperwork is key.
I am sorry. It sucks, doesn't it?
Indeed! If they want to make a big deal and pull some arbitrary rule really your only counter is documentation. Unfortunately.  Same with my own job in IT. Nothing similar, but if an issue does happen we rely on documentation to figure it out."	t9ybn0	trans	116	0.98	2022-03-09 03:17:50
Anger is my only mental illness	"Who the hell was the idiot that declared being trans is a mental issue?

I was created and started life as a female in the womb. Then at about 3 months some hormones released, messed up and 6 months later I am born, still a female with some male body parts.   
Things are broken and not right. Now I want to do something about it and I am mentally ill?  
It is the same as if my arm is broken and because i feel I cannot lift something, I am mentally ill, and incapable to deal with a body malfunction!

The WHO already stated in 2019 that Trans is not a mental illness. So why oh why do we still have to go through phycologists and therapists in order to transition?

Everybody screams My body My rules. Guess what: Some phycologists and therapists gets to decide what happens to your body. Where is freedom now? Where is my basic human right to privacy and deciding for myself what and who I want to be?

Trust me I tried phycologists and therapists. I was talked down to while the believed they can ""cure"" me. And no I am not a child or even a teen. I am 59 already and fought my whole life already. 

We are fighting for acceptance but medically we are more discriminated against than any other sector"	"Being trans isn‚Äôt a fecking mental illness, it‚Äôs just a description of the relationship between my very real body and my very real gender

And not even Dysphoria It‚Äôs not a mental illness at all

It‚Äôs a mental disorder caused directly by my body having the wrong hormones in my body with the additional very real trauma from being forced to act in a way that i didn‚Äôt want to

There‚Äôs nothing wrong with my brain ):<
It's so stupid because even if we cave and agree it's a mental illness TRANSITIONING IS THE TREATMENT! Like people with depression get meds, people with anxiety get meds, HRT is our meds. Surgery is our treatment.
Yep. I‚Äôm sick and tired of having to prove my transness and validity to people who aren‚Äôt affected by what I do with my body. 

And if we *were* mentally ill, surely the compassionate thing to do would be to help us, not withhold treatments which are proven to help alleviate so much discomfort.
It's not a mental illness. There's a LOT of bias in psychology towards us.
It's very much not. Brain=a, body=b. The two need to match to function, and we can't change the brain to match the body, but we can change the body to match the brain. It all still comes down to what society thinks should be the 'norm', and doing their best to erase or hide anything that doesn't fit that neat little box. We've seen the same arguments time and again when it comes to women, race, immigration, sexuality, and now gender. The harder they make it, the less of us will live as ourselves. Just look at how long they tried to make left-handed people write with their right-hand. 

It does seem to be getting better, but we are still a LONG ways away. I'm a trans guy transitioning in my late twenties. I know I'm in a better position than a lot of people, but it still could be so much better. You don't need a letter from a mental health professional to get a piercing. You don't need to wait two years to 'be sure' before getting a tattoo. You don't get fired for getting plastic surgery. Yet, that somehow doesn't apply to anything gender-affirming when it comes to medical care."	sjlp9q	trans	97	0.96	2022-02-03 15:15:50
There were no signs!	"This is just something that I (MTF) want to get off my chest. Whenever I heard that comment from people who knew pre-transition me, I just get so incredibly frustrated. But I‚Äôm also the type of person who will forget the answer to a question the moment I‚Äôm asked it. So I thought this would be a good place for it. 

Maybe you didn‚Äôt see the signs because every time I did something feminine you and others would relentlessly bully, and shame me for it. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because you‚Äôd try to constantly ‚Äòcorrect‚Äô my behavior. 

Maybe it‚Äôs because every time I did something that came natural and felt right, I‚Äôd be told that I‚Äôm being gay. Which was internalized as meaning bad. 

Maybe I was forced to go through all kinds of male rites of passage. Forced to cut my hair. Forced to wear certain clothes. Shouted at for putting on nail polish. 

So here we‚Äôre some of the fucking signs. 
I freaked out when I went through puberty and my voice became deep. 

I always gravitated towards the most effeminate looking men when I talked about how I wanted to look growing up (thanks jrpgs) 

I twirled in front of a mirror imaging myself as a ballerina or in a wedding dress. 

I constantly role-played as and chose female characters in games (until you mocked me) 

I only had meaningful friendships with other women. 

I went to sleep hoping I‚Äôd magically wake up in the right body.  Every damn night. 

I was an empty shell that could only muster the emotions of anger and had no purpose. 

I would buy outfits I liked for my girlfriends to wear them vicariously through them. 

Constantly answering that I‚Äôm a lesbian when asked about my sexuality since I was 13. 

Constantly avoiding using gendered words (non English language) when talking about myself. 

I could go on for another 50 examples. 

I didn‚Äôt get the chance to figure out my gender or sexuality because before I could even think it through I was bullied, beat and shamed into thinking that I didn‚Äôt have any options. 

I didn‚Äôt get the chance to do so because I had to go trough so much other crap that I was in survival mode for 25 years. 

I didn‚Äôt have the chance.  

/Rant over."	"I feel this so much. according to my mom I stopped showing any signs after I sent to school. She thought I was trans at some point but ended up thinking it was nothing because the signs disappeared. The signs disappeared because I immediately caught on to how the other kids reacted, and I was terrified of being excluded, so I hid it from everyone out of intense fear. Until even I completely forget about it when I entered my teenage years. and those were the most abhorrent years of my life, I didn't even recognise what I was feeling as dysphoria because it was never talked about anywhere.

I've never been told there weren't any signs, but I was constantly reminded I was different. I was asked if I was gay, I hated being compared to guys cuz I wasn't like them, I was terrified of the things puberty did to me, I was in despair. I had to hide literally everything that made me me because if I didn't I'd be ridiculed. I was terrified.
Omg this resonates with me beyond words.

I've been getting that line from my mom a lot lately who is in complete denial and despair over everything.

Never could figure out relationships and I believe every romantic partner I ever had asked me if I was gay at some point or another, often in an aggressive or demeaning tone.

Forced to cut my hair, forced to wear clothes I hated, forced to play sports. Never ever holding any connections or fitting in with the boys. If I did attempt to make male friends it was bullying and being called the f slur for expressing myself around them. Not understanding why my body image issues could never be cured despite obsessive fitness and workout routines

Early signs in my life were shut down almost immediately in my family when I would play with my sisters Barbies, try on my moms heels, skip around the house, ask to play gymnastics, and often berated for ""talking and acting gay"" etc.

Lol no signs because I was in self-preservation mode literally FIGHTING FOR MY SURVIVAL in society since I was a young child.
This made me tear up because it's so relatable. I am pre HRT and I don't even know if I'll ever be on it, and I'm 30. This hits deep.
This hits home hard. 

Thankfully most people have come around for me, but there's always people that can't see you for who you are. They can either accept you; the real you, and those who mind don't matter. 

Its crazy to me how any social expression of gender variance is immediately shunned. We talk of living in a free world, but in reality we're being forced into tiny social boxes rather than expressing ourselves for who we truly are.

Yes, you may not understand me. Yes, you may have been too blind to notice me. But if you truly love me for myself, regardless of myself then you will accept me for my full and truest self. üíú
There were always signs, whether we recognized them ourselves or not, whether anyone else saw the signs or not.
There was someone I knew pre transition and saw absolutely no signs. When I found out she‚Äôs trans, i was sad she never felt COMFORTABLE enough to show me any. (She would have been in a no win situation by coming out then, totally no judgment on her) It NEVER crossed my mind that just because I saw nothing meant there was nothing going on!!!

People actually feel entitled to see signs that you‚Äôre trans? Like if they didn‚Äôt see anything, that means you aren‚Äôt?? Every time I find out the shit that binary trans people who knew from a young age and came out much later deal with, I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not. And I hate people more.
Relatable af. I've never been attracted exclusively to any one gender and still pre transition but when it comes to cis women I've had relationships with, I think all of them were either openly bi or more than bi but in the closet and had male nicknames for themselves and would do other masc stuff. They knew long before I figured it out and wouldn't even say anything smh. Second hand signs are also there when you look back.
Same girl, same... Oh reading those hit hard! There were signs, I was just too scared to let anyone know I was feeling that way. So I kept hiding things inside, bottling them up more and more until I couldn't take it anymore.
Literally every woman I pursued asked if I was gay. Everyone could see something was off about me and no one gave a shit. They just saw a depressed and angry teenager and thought nothing of it. 

But omg yes. You react by hiding to protect yourself and then people are surprised.
Wow! This hit me like a ton of bricks‚Ä¶.. for me people just viewed me as more ‚Äúflamboyant‚Äù than the normal kids. After having to suppress it for years due to constant bullying and harassment I hid it and put on my ‚Äúmasculine face.‚Äù I could never figure out why I consistently felt ‚Äúdead inside,‚Äù but after reading an article for parents of signs your kid could be trans that my egg cracked as every point on that article was my life. I just wished that I had realized when I was a kid and asked for help.
It‚Äôs never too late to start HRT. I started at 28 and it‚Äôs life changing. Not saying you should or shouldn‚Äôt. That‚Äôs up to you, but if that‚Äôs your concern then I‚Äôd like to offer that anecdote to alleviate that fear.
My sister wondered if I was gay. Well, no, not like male gay, more like lesbian gay...

Insert ""no, but actually yes"" meme...
+1 for people thinking I was gay. I was genuinely angry, because I wasn‚Äôt denying anything. I just didn‚Äôt like men
Thank you. Sounds clich√©, but if it was solely upto me, I'd do it, but as a POC immigrant with heavy family baggage, and a dedicated partner, it feels like a major step. I can pass somewhat with slight makeup, but all that you wrote in your post is something I've experienced myself, and more, but the price of repression hits hard. 

Hope I get to do it. I've read up about it for years now and I wish I had done it long ago before things became much more difficult to face."	12o0fay	trans	95	0.98	2023-04-16 07:57:29
I'm so done. I'm tired of being treated like I'm not a person.	"I finally thought that maybe my parents would be happy with me being who I want to be, but nope. So for those who don't know, I came out to my parents in June to mixed results. My Mum was originally supportive but then became increasingly hostile until we arrived to today, where we just don't discuss it anymore. My parents still use my deadname and old pronouns even though I've told them countless times that it actually hurts me inside to hear them. 

On the flip side, all my friends and work colleagues use my pronouns and name without a hitch, no questions, they just accepted it. Maybe it's because they're my friends and they care or maybe it's a generational thing, but my parents are either in extreme denial, don't understand or are that transphobic that they're willing to completely alienate their own daughter (Or in their eyes, their son).

So I thought all the stuff about me was dead and buried. The last time I spoke to my Mum about it, she said ""Do what makes you happy, I just want you to be happy with life."" I took that as a green light lol. My Dad had the same stance as he does now ""I can't accept it and will probably never accept it"". So at least that's easy to understand.

I went out to walk the dog this evening, I get back and I see my Mum leaving the kitchen at quite a pace, going straight upstairs. Me, taking the dog's lead off and going in notice that it's super fucking quiet. No ""Hello"", no ""How was the walk?"", nothing. I can tell by my Dad's expression and body language that they've talked about me. He sighs and gives me the rundown. My Mum is scared that I'm going to use the money from my paycheck to fund my own HRT.

Lol

I had to lie and tell him no, that's not what I'm gonna do.
Even though that's what I've been wanting to do for months. And he reiterated that:

He thinks I should get counselling

He doesn't and will never agree with it

He thinks it's one big fetish


So great. This evening has reaffirmed to me that I have one transphobic parent, and one who's completely giving mixed signals about how she feels. I know their acceptance isn't everything, and I've had people in the past comment and tell me ""Educate them"", ""Have therapy together"", ""Give them time"", ""They'll understand"", ""You don't need their acceptance"", except I do. I live at home, I have a paid internship to my name and barely any money. My only out is planning on doing a postgraduate halfway across the UK in Scotland, in 5 months.


Right now, I have no other avenues, so I'm stuck. 


And I really don't know what to do 
I'm tired and angry of having this dual life 
One of my parents screaming my deadname whenever they want me for something 
Of being called a ""good boy"" 
And being referred to as a lovely girl, and by my name. 
I'm at the point now where I don't know if I wanna scream in anger or just fucking cry, but I'm done."	"I'm so sorry to hear that you have to go through all this. I won't waste your time with advice, it sounds like you've heard a lot of it, and don't much want more. Just know that even though this is some internet community, we're here for you, we care, and we accept you as you are. I know it seems like the end of the world, but things do change, and even though these next five months may be really awful, they won't be forever. Hang in there sister.
It's so hard, I know and I don't think I have any good solutions or easy answers. 
I tried for 20 years or more to gain acceptance or even just tolerance from my parents. It drove me back in the closet and kinda fucked up my life. Finally I learned that I have to be who I'm gonna be. I think if I had done that in the first place and been resolute about it they would have learned to tolerate it, but instead they always had this stupid hope that it was just a phase and that they could somehow fix me. 
There wasn't and won't be a happy ending for me - my dad died a few years ago and my mom will probably die soon - I don't know because we haven't spoken in over ten years. If I had been smarter I would have just been me from the start. Be brave and be strong! You are you and its not up to you to change to fit other people's prejudices, its up to them to get over it. If they love you, and I'm sure they do, they will find a way to accept you.

Edit to add: i think white lies hurt us all more in the end
This might not help your specific situation and it is definitely the kind of ""I'm that petty"" type solution that other people tell me is a bad idea but I'd just simply stop responding to your dead name or old pronouns.

If they shout your dead across the house to get you to come to them don't respond until they either use the name you request or come to physically get you at which point you can explain why you didn't respond. ""You're shouting some strangers name across the house, why would I answer to that?""
Your parents obviously have problems they can't deal with, and are taking it out on you. This is unfair. The sad reality is as long as you live with them this will continue. They've made their positions clear. You know what you have to do. Now you must figure out how to do it.
Oh no. And on top of this bullshit you're stuck in the freaking UK right now. Fuck that. 

You deserve to be treated as the person you are and I honestly wish there was something I could do to help you.
i feel the same, but some of my friends dont take me seriously, i dont know what should i do and in top of that, my family is a mess rn... love ya vm, someday we will be happy
Thank you
I'm just fed up of trying to get their approval on something that they're not going to approve of, so advice is kinda pointless lol

That means a lot, it does feel very lonely sometimes. I know there's a whole lot of LGBT people out there but being stuck indoors in a pandemic is pretty horrible, especially for mental health. I never thought I'd wanna leave home as desperately as I do now.
Thanks for your response
I'm sorry to hear that you've been through a lot, and I'm sorry about your parents.
It hurts me that my friends are a better family to me than my parents - some of them I've never even met and yet they're kinder to me than my own parents. Part of me wants to be vindictive, to just leave and cut contact and show them how it feels, but the other part of me knows that their opinions probably won't change. Not without some counselling - which they won't get since they think they're above that. Once I'm out of here I'll be the person I want to be, but right now I think going all out would only worsen the situation to be honest.
But thank you for your kind and uplifting words, I know there's a light at the end of the tunnel, I just gotta get there!
That's gold haha
I can definitely seeing my Mum getting incredibly pissed by that however so I don't think that's best lol

To be honest I wanted to be infinitely more petty and cut contact with them once I go back to uni for my postgraduate
If they ask why I'll just tell them that I don't think I could ever accept them as who they are and leave it at that. I'm tired of being treated the way I am so fuck it, I feel like I should give them a taste of their own medicine. But my sister has basically done the same, but my parents treated her like crap too so it's understandable.
Well hang in there girl, you got this! We support and accept you!
Hi. I'm so sry for this horrible, exhausting and unfair situation you are stuck in. Even if I'm just a fifteen year old guy from Germany and don't know pretty much anything about life I am willing to help you. Maybe you want to chat? You don't have to talk about the topics above or at all. (I don't use this app for a long time. Is there a DM option?)
I never was in such a situation, but I understand your pain. I don't know the pain you have to go through but I have an idea of it and even this scares me. It must be super hard. 
Please remember: You don't deserve this. You are worth the world. We are behind you. You are not alone. 

If there is anything I can do for you, please let me know.
I wish you the best time and Strength to get through this.
My mom kicked me out of the house before I even knew I was trans for unrelated reasons so I can't say I know what it's like to live with transphobic people or be dependant on them. 

I've generally had enough of taking people's shit to last a lifetime but I realize that not everyone is in a position to be able to do that safely.
Thanks for the reply. I don't mind chatting, sure. There is a DM option on Reddit, I can message you in a sec. Thank you for your kindness!"	m7bjee	trans	91	0.96	2021-03-17 21:45:13
When you get misgendered, do you get really sad first and cry and then boil internally with anger or the other way around?		"I dissociate usually
At this point if I get misgendered I just laugh at whoever did it because if you look at me and earnestly go 'ah yes, a woman' then you're clearly so invested in your transphobia that it's made you stupid.
It happened today at my therapy appointment. I start to kind of dissociate, get over it fast, then think about it for the next hour LOL
I kind of just go numb on the outside and wait until I‚Äôm alone to get pissed off. I don‚Äôt want to give people the satisfaction of knowing they rustled my jimmies.
I dissociate and try to get away from the situation. I get angry later. When the anger fades I'm sad about it.
I dissociate and then feel shameful and uncomfortable  for whatever reason lollllllll
for us it's either a ""huh, who're you referring to?"", an Ugh, or Furious Rage
Usually when I get angry I start crying too so all of the above all at once I guess
If it‚Äôs on purpose then I usually get really angry and then secretly cry afterwards. If it‚Äôs an accident or they don‚Äôt know then I just try and pretend it didn‚Äôt happen, it used to really upset me and I‚Äôd try to leave or atleast stop the conversation but it‚Äôs happens alot so I‚Äôm used to it now
Little column A. Little column B. But generally just disassociate.
Anger first, sadness later.
Neither...
If it‚Äôs by family? I don‚Äôt really care anymore. 

Misgendered by strangers? That‚Äôs when I start sulking.
So, idk if this is just a problem with me or something, but I physically flinch when I get deadnamed or misgendered. Obviously I feel super sad, but I have a hard time feeling angry at strangers, or even people I know. Sometimes I will get mad at myself if I‚Äôm not feeling to well, but most of the time I just feel sad about it
I just move on because it happens everyday of my life so nothing else to do. I‚Äôm stuck in a lease and my family that lives with me, makes it feel like a prison. I‚Äôll cry when someone actually gets it right and the correct name.
""Why did you call me that?"" \*NINJA STARE\*
Depends, depends on who's fronting. Depends on who's close to the front. If my trauma holder is close to the front there is going to be hell to be paid in full. She takes no shits from no one.

If it's one of the littles cry scream throw temper tantrum. 

But I always always, ends with me rapid switching, and having a killer migraine when it's finally finished.
I got misgendered when ordering fast food today. I tend to get a little angry and dissociate and then feel really sad about it after a few minutes
I just feel really gross until I‚Äôm alone and then either get really mad or cry
I'm an NB who only knows how to dress masc or fem so I get excited as fuck whenever someone use they/them anything else is business as usual
I feel absolutely nothing and don't even care at all. I just move on immediately.
It doesnt feel correct or normal for me
I just feel uncomfortable, if anyone misgenders me I feel like it‚Äôs only out of spite, I don‚Äôt pass much but I try hard to dress femininely and look it so it‚Äôd be hard to get it wrong, it doesn‚Äôt happen much but when it does it sucks. Feel really bad about it for a while after though.
Depends. Most of the time I dissociate and then don‚Äôt remember why/understand why I‚Äôm feeling upset hours or days later.
I used to get sad. Now i get angry. At this point anyone that misgenders me is doing it on purpose >:(
Eh, they don't get a vote, I am me. It's bothersome, but that's it.
I cry. My depression gets worse until I do an EMDR session. Then I start to feel better after a day or two. 

I mean, it sucks for my dysphoria but it‚Äôs also that I know that they‚Äôre going to do the same thing to any trans people they knowingly encounter and knowing the mindset that underlies it.
I just shudder for half a second and the rage goes away. I literally shake it off like a dog
I don‚Äôt care. Especially if the person did it by accident (this has never happened though). I don‚Äôt care because I know myself better than anyone else could. And anyone calling me ‚Äúshe‚Äù is legitimately only trying to get a reaction out of me. And they won‚Äôt get it. Because I simply don‚Äôt care. Sometimes I find it funny, because it feels ridiculously wrong to me if someone thinks I‚Äôm a girl.
So in short, I don‚Äôt care and when it happens it feels like a joke
i tell people i‚Äôm a cis woman with a hormone deficiency
Not misgendered but I remember my parents suggested I watched ‚Äúwhat is a woman‚Äù and I had those emotions
I tend to just ignore it, I know I don‚Äôt pass well at all so I just push past it.
Somewhere between ""What young man you mean?""  and ""B* what"" or on special occasions ""Look at my other eyes and call me a young man again"". All completely depending on hot the hormones hit that day.

The outside reaction usually results in me raising my eyebrows in disnelief and taking a deep breath before answering anyways in my most feminine voice possible.
i get annoyed
Sadness, the only person I generally get angry at is myself. The exception is politics will make me angry, but I think wanting to exist in peace is a pretty low bar.
I say, I don‚Äôt know them, so I don‚Äôt give a damn what their opinions are
I literally prepare for an incoming wave of bad vibes.

I usually then return to my normal mantras.

If you miss gender me once I may let it slide, if it's multiple times I will correct you.

It all depends how good I'm feeling that day and how affirmed I feel that moment.

Lately I've just been like 
""lol this person. Doesn't know I'm close to getting 1 'ma'am' for every 'sir'."" Wtf ever...other times if you call me sir more than once in an interaction I'll correct you and feel pretty euphoric later.

However telling myself that 'it doesn't bother me' is a sure fire ticket to depression and anxiety land. I mean I'm probably going that way anyway but it's nicer to head that way with myself intact.
I haven't even started HRT yet and look (and especially sound!) more masculine than feminine, so it's understandable when strangers misgender me. I still get a little sad.

To end on a positive note, last week was the first time a stranger gendered me correctly, despite me introducing myself by male pronouns for legal reasons. That was quite a suprise, but a welcome one.
So when I get misgendered I don‚Äôt take it personally unless it‚Äôs someone I know. Everyone makes mistakes sometimes and I don‚Äôt exactly pass or act my gender 100% of the time. Especially on the phone. I sound like a guy because voice training is expensive lol. It‚Äôs when they don‚Äôt correct themselves that I get upset
I generally look at the person confused and prepare for the worst.

In conversations where people are privileged to my transness, it makes me feel either disheartened or disgruntled based on my mood.  


Tangent, but the last time I felt this way was when I had let my facial hair grow a bit to give my skin time to heal and clear up and I had to go and pick up food due to a mix up.  I went boy mode for the first time in a year and that made me super dysphoric, I was both pissed and ready to break down in tears... it felt soul crushing and disgusting. I went home and packed the few articles of masculine clothes I had in boxes.  

Interestingly, I got more people staring at me weird when I was in boy mode for that run than I do when I dress as myself... so that's an oddly affirming thing.
Feels like a wave of intense heat flaring acrossed my body starting from behind my ears for some reason. How my body lets me know I need to grab my tongue, and temper before they take off.
If it‚Äôs a stranger I just keep it moving. If it‚Äôs someone I know I correct them and keep it moving. It only really upsets me (usually anger and then sadness) if it was intentional or felt microaggressive.
Dissociate a bit, devalue the person Misgendering me in terms of their worth/meaning to that of the traumatized teenagers I used to work with (anything they have or will say or do is meaningless to me as a person, my engagement is an act to keep them stable/safe and I don‚Äôt have to think about them after we part)

Sometimes it makes me sad/lonely/isolated/irritated but I‚Äôve been in this shit long enough that having a reaction more than described above is too much mental emotional energy

Space out, move on, they aren‚Äôt my friends
So many varieties of misgendering, so many responses. So many fools, only two disinterested hands to slap them all.

Seriously it does hurt, still. I‚Äôm not a quiet one on it. I will deadass stop a conversation between multiple people to address this if I think it‚Äôs intentional. I don‚Äôt suffer hate crimes silently. I also tend to speak up if it‚Äôs for a sib in the tribe. 

If it‚Äôs a friend or someone just being super dumb, I am usually gentler. 

I get upset at night, laying in bed. That‚Äôs when it hurts me. I‚Äôm older though. Been out years. 

I find that telling someone they are a walkin‚Äô talkin‚Äô hate crime usually gets their attention. You de ISR if you want to deliver that with a smile or stone faced
Depends of who is misgendering me, if it's someone who I'm actually out to then it just annoys me for a while, otherwise I just kinda go numb since I'm pretty used to it unfortunately
I personally do not, with either of these options. Lol. I just dissociate and (if i did before) tend to never talk to the person again
I ignore it and move on. Most of the time, its done by strangers or people who I‚Äôll have very minimal contact with over my life. If the contact and interactions become more frequent, I‚Äôll correct them. Most people gender me correctly though, so I have a certain luxery others don‚Äôt.
Idk how else to describe it other then bruh moment
At this point, I'm used to it so I don't react or feel anything, but once in a while it becomes too much and I start bawling out of frustration. 

I'm very fem presenting because of my curves but I don't like anything other than he/him even when I wear fem clothes.

But yea like usually I'll just bottle it up and not really mention it until it happens like 50 more times.
It depends because some people make honest mistakes and will see yout you are what you are
It depends on the situation. Here's the way I handled it the last two times:

In the self checkout section of Walmart, I accidentally rang up one item twice, so I needed assistance from the clerk managing the area, a 20 something woman. Usually Cis women that age are supportive, but this one, after I thanked her politely for her help, said ""You're welcome, SIR"" with a sneering mean girl grin. My response was to go home and write a google review for the store, detailing the story and advising caution for Trans shoppers there. The two times I've been back since, I get called Ma'am by the greeters, so I think management reads those reviews and responded, which is to their credit.

The second time I was filling out paperwork with a government bureaucrat. She was making an abstract point about how paperwork is processed when she dropped a ""he"" while talking about my application. She gave no sign of being deliberately cruel about it, so I corrected her, on the spot. She got genuinely embarrassed, and earnestly apologized, and I very explicitly and kindly forgave her,and we both went happily about our days.

Each instance carried with it some internal seething, but nothing which I could not shake of pretty quickly; I am getting much better at managing my emotions since I started transition more seriously (stopped boymoding). 

But whatever your emotional reaction may be, it's valid. That's just my response to being misgendered.
Rage.
I don't care because I see a guy when I look in the mirror so if doesn't bug me as often as it used to
I space out, cry, then convince myself not to hurt or kill myself
disassociate, internalise, try not to jump off a bridge at 1 in the morning
I'm kind of used to it. I use my deadname and he/him pronouns at work so I'm usually not super surprised when it happens outside of work, I usually only get angry when people make no effort to correct themselves and are doing it repeatedly. Especially if it's obvious that they know they messed up and STILL don't correct themselves
1. Act like they aren't talking about or to me, or act confused, ask ""wait who are you talking about?"" 2. Dissociate unless I can't like I'm working or something 3. Get sad and doubt how I look or pass 

I don't get mad unless it's done maliciously by my parents or someone that knows I'm trans and knows they shouldn't be misgendering me.
Internally always internally
I‚Äôm still so new to this that getting gendered correctly makes me do a euphoric little double take, while getting mis-gendered is kind of what I expect
i stopped caring two turns ago, i just assume they misgendered bc they are uninformed, prejudiced or malicious, whichever option is it is not about me, and is between them and their therapist.
If it's a direct family member misgendering me: I don't care. They do it all the time and it's not going to change.

If it's one of my cousins or aunt's/uncle's: If I'm not out to the person, I don't care. If I am, they're polite enough to correct themselves, so it turns out okay.

If it's one of my friends: They have never misgendered me (thankfully). But I think I would probably dissociate and then get really sad later.

And, if it's a stranger: I dissociate and get sad later. Not too sad, because I know I don't look my gender. Not mad because, how was this stranger supposed to know? Just, dissociate so I don't make them feel like they did something wrong, and then get sad later that I don't look my gender.
I mostly have a freeze response, then try to evaluate if it was a slip up (especially with non-native speakers, where that's totally understandable). The exception is with students, where it's often technically misgendering, but in a colloquial ""catch-all"" manner (the students in my area refer to their teachers as ""dude"" and ""bro"" when expressing disappointment with decisions). There I don't react beyond giving a quizzical look and saying, ""I'm neither a dude nor your bro.""
i have been trans for most of my life before i even knew what 'trans' meant, and always referred to myself as the gender i identify with. so when it happens most of the time i don't even realize people are referring to me, but when i do i'm just indifferent or i get angry/sad because i feel like they're talking to someone else instead of me.
I had someone try to be mean on a picture I posted. They kept saying the usual ""Youll never be a woman"" etc but then she said. ""Resorting to a wig"" inadvertently she just complimented my natural long blonde hair üòÇü§£

Side note: I was pointing out the definition of a woman would include 11-13 AFAB kids as they have the ""biology of a woman"". She didn't want to acknowledge it and decided I was not allowed an opinion as I was ""not biologically experienced"" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Guess I'm not allowed to worry about predators of children.
Im not passing at all so i dont mind too much
disassociate and spend an unhealthy amount of time thinking about it :/ then move on
Urgh. I try to shrug it off but these days it‚Äôs harder. Mix of dissociation and anger followed by inescapable hopelessness. Really stupid how bad this shit still affects me. Also really stupid how much I get misgendered despite having visible tits under my shirt, that are pretty fucking easy to see but being a trans girl is already a tick against me, the fact that I‚Äôm sort of a butch on top of that is another big tick.
Don't be shy correct them
Usually I get sad then dissociate. If it happens multiple times with no one correcting the people misgendering me, then eventually I‚Äôll boil over in anger. Because I dissociate and get quiet usually, my anger seems to come from nowhere and causes more problems than it solves. 

Source: spending winter break with my transphobic family. I eventually started yelling ‚ÄúHe! Fuck you!‚Äù at them when they misgendered me. Needless to say, they didn‚Äôt take too kindly to that.
I‚Äôm numb to it. I‚Äôm so used to it all that there‚Äôs no reaction. It‚Äôs just a part of my life I can‚Äôt change.
I wince, bottle it up and feel sad later, I'm closeted, it's not their fault.
I just stop, I feel like time has stopped, ppl are still moving around me but I don't talk anymore, when I go to my room I start the process of breaking down
Haha usually it's my own fucking family so I'll just let myself feel the dysphoria and then listen to music or remove myself from the situation to cope.
No I boil in anger first than cry
I get angry and dissociate. 

This usually lasts for about 1 minute. 

And then I spend the rest of the day shit talking them in my head. 

Between this and becoming a full license cosmetologist

My roast game has gotten phenomenal.
joke's on them, i use all pronouns.
It's hard to put energy into that anymore tbh I think most trans folk hit a point where they just can't.

i used to feel very angry and stop talking to the person who misgendered me
I‚Äôm agender so I rarely get gendered correctly by people, it doesn‚Äôt really bother me at all anymore because they‚Äôre strangers and it‚Äôs not like their opinion of my gender identity invalidates who I am
I don‚Äôt do either cis women get misgendered all the time.  I just ignore it and move on
I don't really mind tbh, obviously I do prefer being called a she, but when its my family, I do understand why they would prefer calling me a he, idk I never really felt anything when being misgendered but thats just me ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I just cry lol
This, followed by boiling internally and *then* crying üòÖ
Yeah usually it's an internal sigh/disappointment and then often progresses to locking up mentally where I don't really engage with anything happening around me
Mines, a dull pain followed by this
100% I put my head down and walk away
I just correct them and move and and am sad for the remainder of the day üôÉ
LOL yeah that‚Äôs exactly how I feel. I‚Äôm only 16 so I look young, causing me to be more androgynous, so I can understand why people could think I‚Äôm a girl. But the only times I‚Äôve ever been misgendered is because they‚Äôre trying to make me mad. And it doesn‚Äôt make me mad, I just think it‚Äôs funny because of how wrong it feels
I prolly feel worse bc I had to see my transphobic family yesterday haha
Uncomfortable yes, shameful maybe
Furious internal rage, I know they were talking about me
Literally meüò≠
Same:( I just cry later
Same
I try not to get mad at other people, I more just get a tsunami of insecurity after
Aw I know what that‚Äôs like I‚Äôm so sorry:(
Lolollll
Basically same, if it‚Äôs a kid I let it slide but like an adult I try to correct them
Aw:(
Same girl! I‚Äôve been transitioned for over a year and a half now, I know I pass (normally lol) it now makes me feel like people just want me to have an ugly day
Good one I‚Äôll use that next time lol
If people are on purpose transphobic and misgender me I probably will just ignore them and then cry in my car on the way home and if they‚Äôre accidental I‚Äôll get really insecure thinking I don‚Äôt pass and not wanting to go into public for the rest of the day. Crying too haha
Me too!ü•≤
Dang I‚Äôm sorry about that. We shouldn‚Äôt have to deal with our own family and transphobia but.. we doüôÉ
Yeh :/ and I never correct people so if I‚Äôm not close with them and they don‚Äôt know, they keep doing it T_T
Yeah, I get that too. I tend to just sit down and stare off into space feeling awful unless I have something to do or someone that I am talking too.
Thanks I appreciate it. I‚Äôm usually not good at associating with others, but this subreddit really is a place of encouragement, inspiration, and like minded individuals. I never knew how common some of the issues I have faced were until I joined.
This gets them on the back foot...stammering.. if they say something about my andro voice I point to my neck scar (tracheal shave). ""Someone cut my throat when I was asleep."" \*NINJA STARE\* :-P
Lol little bit different, I was talking about my body when I was saying fronting. I have a dissociative disorder called OSDD1B.
 
 Movies and media have stigmatized it but before 1996 they used to call it multiple personality disorder.
 
now they call it dissociative identity disorder, or DID for short. I have a sub division of that called other specified dissociative disorder, or OSDD for short.
 
 There's no serial killer hidden in the midst like movies and all that makes it seem. 

It's essentially like having an apartment filled with people, and whoever fronts is the representative of the household at that time.

So when I say a trauma holder I'm talking about a person in my system who constantly relives traumas that I've experienced So when they're triggered they run to the front as the representative and are willing to bite someone's head off normally causing more problems than helping... 

When I say littles, I mean people who are the age of 10 and younger who are my system who front and be the representative and they tend to react drastically differently than someone who is like and they're 20s or in their teens.
 
 I don't know I could go into a whole spiel of what this is but that's a different topic.
 
 The point that I was making was depending on who fronts has a different reaction, that doesn't mean that we instantly go into angry fit mode or crying, we do try to correct them multiple times and then after a while we get frustrated and then shit happens. I don't know if that makes sense?
I know üòî wish it wouldn't happen to any of us
A good cry never hurt anyone. I don't pass either. I have gotten to the point where I am too uncomfortable boymoding to keep doing it, and my emotional control over things like being misgendered has improved enormously since I stopped.  I honestly try to focus my attention on the people who are not cruel to me, and do my best to ignore the ones who are. That doesn't mean I never wallow in dysphoria, telling  myself  I deserve to be misgendered; only that I get over it faster and more completely than I used to.

Amab trans woman struggling with male expectations pushed on me as a youth	"Growing up and as a young adult one of the things that upsets me and has angered me a lot is the idea that since I was born as male and seen that way by my phobic parents they sort of made me do things they would expect boys/men to. Like being physically tough, doing labor intensive work. It gives me mad dysphoria.

The weird part about this is that it almost sounds like I‚Äôm embracing gender stereotypes and gender roles but I‚Äôm not. After having to live with male expectations pushed on me for so long I personally would like to be treated as a princess, to be ‚Äúspoiled‚Äù, to not have to do grueling laborious work, to be showered with support/love/reassurance that I‚Äôm cared for.

Does anyone here relate or if not at least get what I mean?"	"I get what you mean, from the opposite perspective. It's not that I was ever treated like a princess, or expected to find a man that would - but there were expectations such as being the one that made dinner, keeping the house tidy and clean, have my job be pretty secondary to whatever guy I was with - it was truly an odd mix between parents wanting me to do good in school and getting a nice job/career, but at the same time be ""the wife"" - my (boomer) father pretty much lost it that I was away more hours than my then-fianc√©, although he was also the one that bragged most about my job. 

On the other hand, there was also the whole thing that it was my then-fianc√©'s job to do all the other hard work, men taking heavy bags from me, that sort of stuff. 

I've become pretty allergic to gender stereotypes, and learned to say ""fuck those, I do what I want"" long before I came out as transmasc. That doesn't mean that doing manly things can't make me euphoric though. They are just things I've wanted to do without it feeling odd or quirky or questioned every single time. 

I don't see it as falling to gender stereotypes as much as there is a reason certain things ARE stereotypes. It is because, if we look at the population as a whole, certain things, interests, traits, are just more commonly found in women than in men and vice versa. 

Since you are a woman, you are just *more likely* to have a desire for certain things that are considered typical womanly.

On top of that, we've fought tirelessly against these stereotypes for so long. They didn't fit us, they were wrong for us, or we wanted to be like the other side - conscious or not - so now that we allow ourselves to fully be ourselves and have fully stomped on all expectations that came with our AGAB - we just wish to go full out. We just have a lot of catching up to do.

If being spoiled is what you want, there's nothing wrong with that. It's not you embracing gender stereotypes. That's just you being you, finally, unashamed and unabashed.
A random older man helped me downstairs at a party I was just at. I was wearing heels and he held his arm out and offered to assist me down the stairs. I know I didn‚Äôt need his help, but‚Ä¶ I took his offer enthusiastically. 

I love being treated like a lady! It makes me glow. 

OP, I was raised to be the gentleman. I get it and agree wholeheartedly.
That‚Äôs the feeling most of us older ladies have, growing up with that era. Just be true to yourself and you will definitely feel better eventually. I know that I am finally finding my happy place after 40 years. It takes time and self reflection to get there, but it is truly worth it.
I think a lot of us can relate. You‚Äôre not alone.
I feel so much pressure all the time. I did exceptionally well in college and now also am getting promoted very fast in my engineering job. Everyone sees that and thinks I must be thriving to be able to so well but it feels so isolating to me. I‚Äôm struggling a lot internally and I cope by pouring energy into work and math problems so I can forget about my dysphoria. My psych says ‚Äúit‚Äôs hard to believe you have anything debilitating going on‚Äù because my job performance is not suffering.

My roommates in college jokingly called me Princess all the time because I was usually late and people were waiting on me‚Ä¶ and deep down I loved it even though I was still treated as male. 

I have been literally begging people irl to listen to me and help me because I feel incredibly anxious and everybody just sees it as me opening the door to talk about THEIR problems because they think I can handle it and nothing is really bothering me. I want so much to just be treated like a girl and have emotional expectations where I am believed when I say I‚Äôm stressed out. Everything is expected to be my responsibility as a ‚Äústrong man‚Äù and I absolutely hate that.
Your trying to chase after any and all femininity after being denied it for so long, not surprising to see happen.

I am sortive had that issue but nipped that thought in the bud by reminding myself my sisters were all tomboyish like so no need to be something I don‚Äôt need to be, can be happy being a tomboy like my sisters if need be.

Then again‚Ä¶ didn‚Äôt stop me from getting dresses and wanting more so idk>.>
I get what you mean but I‚Äôm the opposite, I am a trans man and I was lucky to find my soulmate he loves being spoiled, and I‚Äôm happy to let him stay home to be a streamer while I‚Äôm the bread winner.
AMAB agender queer here.
I've embraced my ability to do it all. It has nothing to with gender for me, it's just my ability to learn tasks and compete.
I'm tall, thicc, femme, and strong. Most people have no idea what to call me.
I too crave the soft things, someone to cuddle up with, someone to treat me like a queen and tell me everything is alright.
Baby it's what we all want. You're not strange for wanting it. It's human! We all want someone to take care of us, to pamper us, to spoil us with the things that make us happy.
You're a powerful creature of incredible potential. Embrace it all!
I only recently realized that I‚Äôm trans at 30 after missing all the signs growing up. Yes, I wanted to not do guy stuff. I never longed for girl activities because I wasn‚Äôt exposed to them
There are already a lot of great responses here, but absolutely! Personally, I can 100% relate to what you described. When I was younger I fulfilled very masculine roles and engaged in ""manly"" norms. I did tons of labor for my parents and employement, I played heavy contact sports in school, my roles in relationships was always the stoic caretaker. My hobbies and interests were typical of masculine individuals my age. I know where you're coming from and how that can feel. It's really hard to shed those expectations, ESPECIALLY when they're internalized and coming from inside. You can't just ignore a rude family member or rando at the store, it's you.

Remember to show yourself kindness, give yourself time to reframe those internalized expectations, remind yourself that those messages aren't true for everyone, and you'll be right as rain, girl. Wishing you the best üíõ
I feel the same- I used to think I hated formal environments, then I realized I wanted to be in dresses and treated chivilrously. I was raised as a ‚Äúgentlemen‚Äù to, expected to be manly and stuff. i get it entirely.
I was AMAB and didn't figure it out for almost 28 years. Since then, a big portion of my life has been spent finding thing after thing that I had no reason to believe or support except for societal pressure and general opinion. The amount of positivity I've discovered and self-improvement I have made on both my body and mind has been staggering in perspective to those first 28 years. When you encounter something that makes you upset, ask yourself if you are thinking or doing that thing because society wants you to or has just taught you that things are just this way versus you actually wanting to do the thing. Re-examine aspects of your life and values and choose the ones that create the most happiness for yourself. Worry about the happiness of those around you after you have taken care of yourself.

Stereotypes exist for a reason and are not automatically bad. They are bad when they are used to mock someone or something such as a culture but stereotypes used in their literal sense often reflect some level of popular opinion or preference. After exploring myself have found many things that are female stereotypes that have brought me amazing Joy. There's no reason not to enjoy something just because it is something that stereotypical girls do. Do what you think is right and what feels good to you short of directly harming someone else. And remember that even though many of the haters cry that we are ruining them, their way of life, and their values, you are not causing anyone harm because they can't accept you for who you are.
The amount of stress and anxiety I had about portraying myself as masculine literally ate away at my body. The 2 years before I came out I had constant tension headaches, I had lost over 60 lbs (200 to 140 lbs), I couldn‚Äôt sleep, I had a seizure, and my muscles started to atrophy to the point where I couldn‚Äôt lift more than 40 lbs

Once I came out and stopped pretending to be masculine these things quickly went away.
I absolutely relate. Unfortunately, my apartment complex does not, so off to work I go
Yes!  Honestly I was taught to open doors and let women, children and older folks go first.  I was taught to be a leader, be loud and heard, to make my presence known, to be strong, and show no fear.

As a trans woman who has been out a year and is a technical lead in the workplace.  Some of these lessons have turned me into a very strong leader who is highly respected.  Other parts absolutely destroyed and confused the woman inside of me, and made it so much harder to come out and finally transition.  Fortunately emotionally I have gotten over many of these weird lessons.

But I have to say... its still really weird when I insist an older gentleman go first... and they ABSOLUTELY insist that no I have to go first, or they have to open the door.  Its so affirming but so weird for me still!
I relate to that a lot because I was raised by mormons. I was literally sent to gender brainwashing camps with strict sexist segregation. It really made me feel like I had to be a girl in order to have access to all the things I enjoy. I felt guilty about wanting to be the kind of woman I was and I found 2 things that helped me out a lot. I found that separating my feelings of wanting to be a princess from my gender was really helpful with dysphoria. I want to be who I am, as a woman and not that who I am is because I'm a woman.
And knowing that tons of ciswomen everywhere look for the same kind of attention as I'm looking for and that it's our responsibility as women to let societies image of us affect us as much or as little as it needs to, to go live in this world.

Knowing both of these things helped me embrace my femininity and even made me more comfortable doing traditionally masculine things without dysphoria. It gave me a whole new perspective as to what nonbinary people might experience the world like too. I started identifying as more of a demi-girl femby now that I'm confidently feminine in my own style.
I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm an older lady. But I‚Äôm 27? I of course get that for most people under capitalism, everyone has to work for a living. That‚Äôs not a gendered thing..But that‚Äôs not what I meant. I was talking more about like the type of work I‚Äôm expected to do.. does that make sense?
I‚Äôm envious ü•∫
Yeah.. I still have to work to pay my rent unfortunately  because capitalism.. but at least the job I now work at is not like a typical male expected labor intensive job in the hot sun that always left me exhausted all day that I was expected to do before when I lived with my parents. I know if I was afab I would not have been forced to do that while living with parents.
Like in other words I of course understand that almost everyone has to work‚Ä¶ but I was more talking about the type of work‚Ä¶
Thank you everyone for the beautiful responses and validation. Love you all üíù
Totally makes sense. I‚Äôm actually looking at changing careers from my original career due to not being comfortable in that environment any more. But I already was looking at changing careers before my egg cracked."	y8vtde	trans	82	0.98	2022-10-20 11:35:30

That guy said ""I call you a fool, you're just a member of those group of bandits (trans community), hey sister refer him back to the psychiatrist and don't put my name, i have nothing to do with any of this"", this is your so called doctor, India.

Congratulations, it can mean that your therapist is barely qualified to be one!

When I was I was diagnosed with depression in my early 20s and went to a psychotherapist in India, they asked me about my spiritual belief. I told them that I'm an atheist, and they told me that I needed to rediscover the religion I gave up, in order to help cure my depression, when I clearly expressed to them that I didn't identify with my ex religion anymore. That was the level of incompetence I witnessed, and this is just one instance.

I've had some other terrible fucking experiences with mental healthcare too, and it was all in India. The culture there venerates doctors and places them in a position of worship, lending a lot of absolute fucking dangerous people a lot of authority they shouldn't be having.

Feel free to DM me, I kind of understand what is going on with you.

You are so badass.

I‚Äôm sorry for your experience, unfortunately they are bringing their attitude towards us here to Australia, the only medical centre I can access in my home town is mainly Indian doctors who treat me like shit
I loved visiting India. I really loved coming home, and I live in Florida. I think I get it. Meteor is a bit harsh, how about a really horrid rash? One that they have to rub on a smelly burning lotion to keep it from spreading. Sorry to hear things are that bad there for you. Hugs and kisses
Report them to the AMA.
Same background. Max relatable. Me and my siblings have horror stories of forced mental interventions done on us due to our neuroqueerness and it's absolutely wild that people don't know how messed up it is India regarding all this.
Thank you so much <333
Let me tell you, I have some classy first-hand experiences regarding how politically regressive and backwards-ass a lot of Indian doctors are, and can be.

Glad to know that we are exporting our brand of desi bigotry to the more civilised parts of the globes. /s
You should just stay away from Indian doctors
Actually meteor is better, also thank you.

Dammit, I think we need to start a support group, titled ""Support for Queer Victims of the Indian Mental Healthcare System""
The way the male doctors treat women in well known in Florida.

My mother has issues with men, and so can only see a woman doctor.

I'll call up a new office, verify a female provider is available, set the appointment and thinks we're good.

Every single time, she gets an Indian man.

She's suffering from untreated psoriatic arthritis because we can't find an available women or young, Western man she feels unthreatened by to treat her.

She can't understand their accents. They demean her. They speak to me, instead.

They don't listen as she explains her many health issues. 

So we leave, she suffers and we try again. 

Her health plan only has a few clinics in network and we're at our wits end.

Oh yes please. If you want to start it, I'll join for sure. 

My youngest came out as gay/bi, and was told by the psychiatrist (relayed to my family that is) that you cannot know surely if you're gay or bi until the age of 26, and another psych put him through four rounds of electroshock therapy at 18 to cure his illness (he is very likely autistic or AuDHD and has PTSD like me and my other sibling), misdiagnosed him as schizophrenic, and put him on 7-8 heavy medications including multiple anti psychotics. I've been unable to help beyond helplessly trying my best from across the world. 

They completely effed him up after I left the country because I was the last line of defense. He was such an overall bright boy, a literary genius and a parkour enthusiast. Now he has absorbed my parents ultra religiosity, believes his queerness is a sin, didn't finish high school, is terrified of leaving the house, has next to no friends and has regressed into a childlike state and my heart breaks a thousand times. 

I'm plural, so I was able to avoid his fate but I had to fight for my rights being the eldest and negotiate my way out of there, even if I was wrongly targetted medically for a few years, and I have so much rage about all this. 

It would be considered criminal OUTSIDE of the subcontinent, but he's 21 and completely without agency.
Indian men who become doctors tend to be the most socially awkward nerds that are groomed from childhood to please their parents, and become hungry for social status, and ofcourse the money and prestige that comes with it. What I saw in my batch were a lot of privileged upper-middle class chuds that had lukewarm IQs and terrible social skills, who then go on to slave away at their studies for 5 years or more, get mentally abused by their seniors and their equally abusive professors, and then somehow by the virtue of their skillset, venture out to greener pastures in the Western world to make a fat buck and earn redemption for all the hard work they put in, giving them a sense of entitlement.

Their social skills more or less remain at the same level as when they were younger and lacked self awareness, and that translates directly to the shitty service your mother and you were subjected to. I can't give you a better explanation if I tried, it's exhausting enough already, from all my experiences with them.

Edit: Removed some info regarding personal stuff
That's good.
Okay. Time to take a deep breath.

This. Induces so many feelings in me, right now. I'm livid with a sense of cold rage in my abdomen right now.

Your parents and whoever that fucking therapist is gaslighting the absolute living shit out of your sibling. Fuck desi parenting, and fuck religious fundamentalists. You're god damn right this shit would be considered criminal outside our cluster-fuck of a country.

Also, solidarity with finding another queer ex-Muslim in the wild. I'm going to DM you now, if that's alright. Perhaps yes, we can create such a group, a discord or a subreddit, so that we can all share our experiences with being mishandled by the system, and figure out ways to heal together.
My dear friend, white men over the age of 50 suffer the same malaise as your countrymen.

Entitlement.
Ahhh, another queer exmuslim from India? Always welcome in my DMs. 

And yeah, it's honestly so exhausting. My family has a history of mental illnesses (cousin marriages galore, wink wink), and they mask it with religion instead. My parents took a deep turn to religiousness after their own experiences left them shook and I feel angry and pitiful towards them because remove religion from the equation and they truly are really good people, but they are so terrified of it.
It's global then, hahaha.

I thought it was normal to want to be a boy?	"So I was recently taking to a small group friends. (We shall call them, Sarah, Lily and Maya) 

So, it came to the conversation of our year 10 formal. I told them I didn't want to go because I know my mum would want me to wear a dress. Lily asked me why as I would ""look pretty in a dress"".
This comment made me physically repulsed, I got really defensive and kinda pissy. It was more passive aggressive than anything else tho. However, this story isn't about my anger issues. I told Lily that I was a tomboy and didn't like that kinda stuff. 
Later Maya commented that I ""never leaving the guys alone, "" and that ""boys need time to be boys without girls."" 
I snaped at her, saying that I wanted to accepted as a boy. This was followed by an desperately awkward silence. Sarah, being more accepting, asked me if I was trans. I was baffled and quite stubbornly, I denied the accusation. ""It's totally normal to want to be a boy. I'm not trans I just rather not be a girl. Everybody has those kinda thoughts though, right?""

Awkwardly, Maya and Lily left the conversation. Like I was some type of disease. Sarah told me that it's totally okay to have these kind of thoughts. But I should maybe explore my 'gender identity'. I don't even know that means! 

The more I think about, the more I realize that there's something wrong with me. The way I hate my body. The way I get so excited when someone mistakes me for a boy. That I used to steal my brothers underwear. That I still wear bored-shorts to the beach. 

I don't wanna be trans. I just can't be. Not in my conservative school, they'll kick me out. What would my mum think? F that, what would my dad do! I'm so screwed. I want it to go away. 

If I don't want to be trans, doesn't that mean I'm not trans? I don't know! I need help and I don't know where else to go?"	"Okay, first things first. There is nothing wrong with you. This can be something that is very hard to actually internalise for any of us, but these feelings categorically do not mean you are broken, you're mentally ill, you're sick, whatever.

Secondly, very few of us actually want to be trans or particularly like being trans. There are a couple of reasons for this, primarily because medical science cannot get us a fully functioning version of the body that we want. Some trans girls (Born male, transition to female) hate the fact that they can never be pregnant. It's also just harder to be trans than cis since cis folks just \*don't think about being the other gender\*, and all the difficulties and pain that these feelings cause just aren't a thing for them.

Being trans just means that we're happier doing and, more importantly, being something that is restricted to another gender.

Around your personal situation, I'm afraid I haven't got much advice. All I can say is that the feelings don't go away. You can keep a lid on them once you know which feelings to keep a lid on, certainly, but repression won't be the thing that makes you happy.

I hope this is helpful in some way,

Maia.
I don't know what to tell you, I wish I wasn't trans either. Repressing it might've caused 25 years of depression. I wish I could give you useful advice, but all I have to offer is my sympathy. Can you get like a therapist or someone who you can talk to that you can trust?
so a) i don‚Äôt want to be a boy. b) ehh, wanting has very little to do with anything
If your parents love you they should be able to get over it. No matter what you do, do not repress these emotions unless it is physically and mentally unsafe not too.
Nothing is wrong with you.

I have also always had these feelings of ‚ÄúI want to be a boy, I don‚Äôt want to be a girl.‚Äù üëç

You could try Jackson Bird‚Äôs book ‚ÄúSorted‚Äù. (He‚Äôs a trans man and is on YouTube)
It takes awhile to figure yourself out. Think about it, research it. Understand what being trans is. There is no one way to be trans or one way to be anything. Trans is not only man and woman. 
It's not something you can push away. 
Try to take it at your own pace. Gender identity is never as simple as it feels like it should be. You are whoever you are.
Why is your generation always so black and white? Like way to jump to extremes there bucko. I grew up in the 90s and id wear jeans and tshirts and i always wanted to look ""cool"" rather than cute. I was a tomboy as much as i could be. I loved guys styles more so than womens and i always dressed more masculin. There were no conversations about it, there were no oh i must be trans, or whatever. Nah i just wore whatever tf i wanted to wear. Sure there were some issues thst made my life harder like kids being aholes, but thats gonna haplen no matter what you do. My mom tried amd tried to get me to be more feminine, because she wanted a little girl but it kind of worked out for me that she too was more tomboyish. 

It was just never a big deal because i didnt let it be. Wearing the clothes you want isnt an issue unless you make it one. Doesnt mean you have to automatically want to be a guy just because you dont like dresses. So just stop putting that pressure on yoirself and wear wht you want. Look at David Bowie he was a rockstar and dressed however he wanted. 

Start by just wearing what you want and then slowly over time if you feel like its not enough then you can start to question yoir gender identity, but you dont have to havs all the answers right now. You dont have to make sense to other people and you sure as hell dont have to explain yourself either. Idk how old you are, but go live your life and dont give a fk what anyone has to say aboit it. Its YOUR life. It might seem scary because you dont want to lose people or be alone, but trust me, if they dont accept you for you, then theyre not worth having around anyways. Find people who dont care what you identify as but rather who you are. 

As for wanting to be a boy. Thats something you need to explore. Why do you want to be a boy? Take away how you FEEL about it, but what about the idea of not being a girl makes it so appealing. Short hair? Girls can have short hair. Dont want to have to live up to perceived gender role? Then dont. Make a list and analyse it. The WHY is so important. If after all that you still feel like you should be a boy, because its deeper than superficial things brought on by society, then look at your options. Go talk to a specialist who can help you  learn about transitioning and give you tips on how to approach your family and friends etc. 

Good luck.
It‚Äôs not whether or not your trans or not. Boys need time to be boys. You‚Äôre already a tomboy as you said. Look at it as a head start in embracing your tomboyness. You get to do things boys don‚Äôt get to do till later‚Ä¶ the rest time will tell
Yeah I have a therapist, but it's very hard for me to open up irl.
I don't know why I want to be a boy. I've had these thoughts since I was a kid and it's only gotten worse. I wanna be only a tomboy I really do. But when I look at my chest, when someone calls by feminine titles; I just wanna bash a rock over my head until I bleed out. Fuck, I don't know. Mabye I am making shit up. I subconsciously just want attention so I lie to myself. I'm so confused and lost.
I don't want to be separated from the boys though. I always have embraced my tomboy nature, since a was 6 I've been doing that. I don't want to do the things boys don't get to do.
I wasnt actually expecting you to give me an answer as to why. Those are questions you need to explore yourself. Work on the relationship you have with yourself and everything will fall into place. You keep saying you dont know, well go figure out. Ask yourself questions. Write down how you feel and come back a week later and see what you wrote. Youd be surprised what you can discover when you pay attention to yourself. 

Ask yourself questions like, ""why does ot bother me when people call me a girl?"" And then answer it as honestly as you can. Out loud in the dark before bed if you have to, so no one will hear you and you can say whatever comes to mind. And then talk it over with yourself, literally. Talk to yourself lol. There is no right answer, there is only your truth and what that means to you. 

If you ever believed in santa claus, then you can believe in yourself long enough to find some answers youre looking for. Trust yourself and dont be so hard on yourself. You have the rest of your life to figure it out. Its a journey.
You‚Äôre entitled to that, but really there isn‚Äôt a lot that you can‚Äôt do most sports are those things, but there still is football. Everything else is gender neutral. Don‚Äôt hold yourself back because of that. Speaking with your therapist should guide you if they‚Äôre the right ones. I‚Äôm terms of statistics it isn‚Äôt the normal, but I do hope you find where you wanna be and how you wanna be and make the steps to achieve it. To me, I ve always been with the girls and was more like them. I never noticed that‚Äôs how I see myself and they me. I went to a conservative school and these days are much more laxed."	rjutgf	trans	74	0.96	2021-12-19 11:20:54
I answered Matt Walsh‚Äôs question	"What is a woman? Well in order to answer that, let me define the color Red for you. It doesn‚Äôt seem related, but trust me it is.

Defining the color red: a color on the color spectrum opposite/complimentary of green. Usually, but not always, associated with danger, blood, and anger.

Defining a woman: a gender on the gender spectrum opposite of man. Usually, but not always, associated with tenderness, softness, and femininity.

That‚Äôs literally all there is to it. A woman can be feminine and most people would expect that but they don‚Äôt have to be, and they‚Äôd still be a woman. Red can indicate danger and most people would expect that but you could make the main good guy of a movie have a lot of red in the color palette and it‚Äôs still the color red.

Just because red isn‚Äôt indicating danger or blood or anger doesn‚Äôt mean that it isn‚Äôt the color red. Just like a woman doesn‚Äôt have to radiate femininity or have certain body features to be a woman."	"Also remember that many Asian cultures, red is a symbol of vitality and health and joy much more than one of danger. To the point that brides traditionally wear red to their weddings :)

In the same way what is a woman in one circumstance might be completely different to another. All ways and interpretations of femininity are valid and beautiful <3
A woman can be whatever you want her to be, she can be feminine or masculine but that doesn't make her any less of a woman! ‚ù§Ô∏è

People should spam that idiot with definitions of woman all day every day, to get it in his thick skull.  
But we know he only pretends to ask in order to sell the lie that the left has no answers ‚Ä¶ oh well, he isn‚Äòt worth the effort anyway.
This is pretty much the thing that everyone knows including Matt, but he did not want to say this because of his propaganda film. People need to stop putting so much effort into this idiot and this idiotic ""documentary"" and let it die. Every time it comes up it rehashes the whole thing all over again. I was just beginning to forget about it. This is a very good way to describe the answer however for people who don't quite understand gender fluidity.

>a gender on the gender spectrum opposite of man


So now you have to explain what do you mean by man?
Exactly what I was saying
Nope. Sex is male and female, gender is man and woman
[removed]
[removed]
Well since I did the definition of woman and red earlier in the post, I‚Äôll do the opposites of both

Man: A gender on the gender spectrum opposite of woman. Usually, but not always associated with toughness, manliness, and masculinity.

Green: a color on the color spectrum opposite/complimentary of red. Usually, but not always, associated with life and nature.
[removed]
A woman is the opposite of a man.

A man is the opposite of a woman.

Don't you see any flaw in your definition
[removed]
Those are both true statements that can be used to describe those genders, are they not?

Colors are on a spectrum, so is gender. That‚Äôs why colors need to be defined by their relation to each other and what they **could** (but not always) be associated with. Same applies to gender because that lies on a spectrum too.

Btw I find it very funny that you made a whole account for being transphobic. It‚Äôs good to know that us trans people are living rent free in your head. I love that you‚Äôre spending your time hating trans people instead of being happy and living a good life.
[removed]
What is the ideal definition of a woman? What descriptors perfectly encompass the definition of a hypothetical person who is absolutely all the way to the right of the spectrum( man left, woman right)

I‚Äôm not going down without a fight	TW: suicide mention. I‚Äôm sure everyone on trans reddit has heard the news about Missouri, and unfortunately for me I live in that hellhole. I‚Äôm lucky enough to already be on T, which right now means that I‚Äôll get to stay on it, but if Republicans are willing to go this far then who knows what they‚Äôll do next. The way things are going, I‚Äôll already have to look out of state for top surgery, and all day long I‚Äôve been alternating between panic and numbness at the thought of being detransitioned. For a while now I‚Äôve been looking at all the genocidal laws being passed around the country and thinking that if I can‚Äôt transition I‚Äôll kill myself, but now that that‚Äôs looking more and more likely I‚Äôve realized that for the first time in a long time, I give a shit whether I live or die. I‚Äôve improved so much in the short time I‚Äôve been on T and I‚Äôve been so excited to see more changes come, and I‚Äôm not going to let them take that from me. Whether it means going out of state for healthcare, moving in with one of my sisters in a blue state, or just hunkering down here and waiting out the storm, I‚Äôm not giving up that easily. I‚Äôm going to take the energy I‚Äôve used to hurt myself in the past, every bit of anger and spite, and direct it toward surviving, because fuck doing Republicans‚Äô dirty work. If they want me to die, they‚Äôll have to kill me themselves.	"Too angry to die is my vibe too.
I'm right here with ya bud this place seems like to be getting worse all the time but I try to remind myself that we got folks trying to look out for us like the HRC and ACLU and whatever others have been trying to help out around here so I don't feel so fucked about being stuck here (that and at least we aren't Florida)
Republicans are not going to be in power for the next 20 years. They have pissed off so many people with their bullshit, How did it go for them last time? BAD. HAs their bullshit gotten any better? NO> The majority of Americans are beginning to believe they've lost their qanon minds and don't ever even think about voting for them again. Next election cycle when they lose so bad, they have to take up arms and have a real insurrection. The pendulum swings both ways so just hang on till 2025. If Dems can rid the congress of enough of them we can right the ship and go after the haters of democracy and actually do something about these criminals.

Until then be safe.

Exactly this. These lawmakers know what they are doing is unpopular, not to mention none of these laws will pass legal challenges. The problem is that the courts are slow and we have to suffer this nonsense until they are resolved.

Terrified	"First off, I pay my respects to Brianna and her family. She should have lived a long heathy and happy life. She was 16.

She was found with stab wounds in a park in Cheshire, UK.

I‚Äôm terrified. From the UK and trans, and 15, I feel like she could have been me. Only a year older, killed by fuckers my age. I‚Äôm scared of people my age now and even being trans. I have never felt something like this before - anger and, for the first time, genuine fear and dread for me and the people around me. To be honest, at this point I just really need someone to be around who understands it all, the struggle and the fear.

But there‚Äôs no one."	"I'm sorry, I know how you feel. Living in the southern United States is hell right now. There are good people out there though, you just have to take care and find them...
take some deep breathes, yes what has happened is quite really saddening and frightening, you always have some people to talk online, hopefully you can try to find someone later on to comfort you irl.  


I would suggest bringing something to protect yourself with, in the world we live today you would feel you shouldnt need to but, it is always good to have something to protect yourself with no matter what.  


I am not trans however, I am a femboy \^\^; but I do bring my fair share of weapons to keep myself safe..
Yup. I'm also scared. Surrounded by bigots and hate.
I don‚Äôt have a lot to say, cause you‚Äôre right and the world is scary, and I also am scared leaving the house lots of days (and I‚Äôm a full adult). But there are people out there who will love and support you. Maybe your family, maybe not. But definitely friends and maybe future family who will absolutely be there. 
Things will eventually get better, and until I they do, I feel like the one of the best ways we can honor those who don‚Äôt make it Is to just try to live out our lives as happily as we can.
 Also we should work to make this hell-world better for the people who come after us so that shit like this stops happening. :/ But first you have to take care of yourself. 
Obviously none of us on the internet are likely close by, but we‚Äôre still here for you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
Sorry. The world is terribly upsetting, and unsafe. Be careful.
Whilst im not transitioning or even out i dont feel unsafe. However, Brianna (Rip Brianna) was murdered within 30 miles of my home. Im currently 21 and usually feel fairly confident i could protect myself in the event of someone attacking but Briannas passing does make me feel as though i maybe shouldnt transition anytime soon, if ever.
Pepper spray is what i personally recommend, it's non lethal easy to use and can stop more than one aggressor at a time. it personally makes me feel much safer to have some on me whenever I'm out of my house.
Find local trans people and build relationships with them. Look for groups, the only one I know in the UK is Mermaids? Maybe your school has an LGBTQ group?

Strength in numbers, strength in organization.

I came out to my Grandma tonight	I'm Trans (MTF) and my family doesn't know. My grandma (who raised me my entire life and has basically been my mom) recent found out I was bi (pan but she's a little new to the other words) and was completely accepting of my instantly. Tonight after a talk with my therapist and her telling me she's afraid of dying with me hating her, I decided to confess to her, who I truly am. Needless to say, it went literally better than I'd ever have expected. She's always called me Spike, so she's not really going to use my name, and she's not gonna refer to me as She when around family and stuff (since they're all full of bigotry) but she's offered to do my hair and help me learn how to paint my nails. We're taking baby steps, and helping me embrace my Feminine side. We've also both been crying for nearly five hours, just apologizing to each other for all the years of hatred and anger towards each other. Tonight has gone millons of times better than I ever thought, and frankly I'm happy things turned out how they did.

Feeling the worst dysphoria I have felt	"28 mtf here. Just over 1 month on HRT. Was doing good, then all the sudden over the last few days the dysphoria has just been slamming down on me‚Ä¶ 

I know it‚Äôs too early to see physical changes, but I am suddenly irrationally gutted that I don‚Äôt see any changes yet. A month of work and nothing has changed. 

I‚Äôm in a constant daily battle with the hair all over my body. It doesn‚Äôt matter how good a job I do shaving my face; within a few hours I have visible stubble. 

Voice training has yielded no progress. I know it takes time. I know a month is too little time‚Ä¶ but I‚Äôm just‚Ä¶ irrationally gutted and I don‚Äôt know how to deal with it.

I‚Äôm just so insanely jealous of cis women who effortlessly have everything I work so hard for and fail to attain. 

As an egg I didn‚Äôt feel dysphoria this way. I just had a generalized apathy towards my body that I thought everyone had. I‚Äôve never felt like this before. Just completely overwhelmed with anger, grief, and‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt know‚Ä¶ this futile sense of existential dread that everything about the body I am in is wrong‚Ä¶  

My parents don‚Äôt understand and don‚Äôt care to understand. They haven‚Äôt disowned me or anything, but it‚Äôs clear I make them uncomfortable. As if I‚Äôve told them I have some sort of freaky fetish‚Ä¶ 

How do I deal with the dysphoria? How do I make it go away; or at least die down some? I hate this. I hate this feeling so much. 

Any advice would be greatly appreciated‚Ä¶"	"I'm not on HRT yet and what I know most about it T, so take all this with a grain of salt, but your recent spike in dysphoria may be due to HRT. HRT can cause some intense mood swings and if you've never felt dysphoria this badly before and it came on pretty suddenly it may be caused by chemical mood swings. I absolutely recommend talking to your doctor about it and seeing if you could try taking an antidepressant. It's not a guaranteed solution, but it might help.
Hi, I‚Äôm 17 ftm and I just wanted you to know I understand what you‚Äôre going through. Something that helps me with dysphoria is having a strong support group that always genders me correctly and understands what I‚Äôm feeling. So maybe you could try talking to friends. Also I‚Äôm 7.5 months on HRT and for the first 3ish months I still didn‚Äôt really pass or see too many changes at all and I felt just like you did. But now at 7.5 months I‚Äôve been completely passing for a while and my dysphoria is a lot better. I‚Äôm just telling you this to remind you that while changes might seem slow, they are happening, and one day you‚Äôll wake up and notice something new and it‚Äôll make you super happy. I know it‚Äôs hard to look forward to that when the dysphoria is so bad, but just know that you‚Äôll be there soon. In the meantime, wear things that give you gender euphoria and be kind to yourself.
After starting HRT I was really happy but I started to get new dysphoria about things I didn‚Äôt before further down the line. I think it was because I had hope, I wasn‚Äôt emotionally numb anymore. Social dysphoria was new too, being out to people made me want to be treated differently but my friends, and family for the most part treat me the same. Once you see improvement you will feel better, while waiting on your hormones to do their thing try to make some other positive changes.
hi love , ftm here whos dysphoria has been whooping hym in the ass . dysphoria is so real and such a pain and so .... disheartening / frustrating . getting on HRT ( and being through your first month ) is a huge step !!! i know we all want to see the changes we crave immediately , but its very important to remember that we are all different and we will all see changes at a different rate . be kind to yourself during these times , your body is going through a ton of changes internally and is working on also bringing those changes to the surface . its normal to feel overwhelmed and frustrated when youre not seeing the results you want , but its important to be kind and gentle with yourself . im pre testosterone , but ive managed to get my voice deeper with voice exercises i find on youtube ( just search voice exercises mtf ) . if you decide to do voice exercises , remind yourself that again its not going to be immediate and you have to do it everyday , but that doubled with HRT should bring you results faster . remember to also drink a ton of water if you do this , please dont loose your voice :) 
overall i understand how challenging dysphoria is and im incredibly sorry for how you are feeling right now . the way you are feeling does not make you less of who you are . you are a beautiful woman inside and out , you will see the changes you crave so deeply soon , and itll feel so good . wear things that make you feel beautiful , do your makeup or hair in ways that bring you euphoria , find ways to affirm your gender for yourself , but remember its also important to have others around who will also affirm it for you . 
sorry for such a long response <3
I can definitely sympathize with the experience of dysphoria becoming worse/more acute after starting HRT lol. I'm about 6 months in at this point and while I've adapted to it a bit, I definitely had the same experience of dysphoria changing from a general background ""fuzzy"" kind of thing to something sharp with acute triggers. It does get easier with time and as you start to see some more progress, but I'm NGL some days still feel like the worst ever. I just try to remember that Depression Brain is a liar and especially likes to lie about things being permanent, i.e. being stuck in something like a depressive episode can make you feel like things have always been the way they are now and will always be the way they are now, even though that's absolutely not true. Learning how to recognize when Depression Brain is lying to you and to remind yourself of the truth is a skill that takes some practice, but it does get easier the more you do it.

For some that has tried hormones for short periods a couple of times, i am mtf, and everyone is different, around 1 month i found it the hardest, a few very subtle changes had happened bit not noticeable, you expect this to continue but everything sort of appears to stop, for me then at about 2 months things started to happen again, downstairs started to go very soft, libido went all over the place, breast soreness started and small lumps started to develop. I am a bit on the chubbier side and fat started to go to places and feel a lot softer, looking in the mirror you wouldn‚Äôt notice. Just remember this really is a long journey, things are changing but you won‚Äôt notice, as you see yourself everyday. You‚Äôre doing fine and soon you will notice results, some people see this quicker than others, just accept it, you‚Äôre getting there and you‚Äôll be fine. Hrt plays with your emotions, it is powerful stuff, hang in there.
Like you point out in your post... It takes time.

**Dysphoria** is a bitch for sure. And I really can't give any advice on coping with it. It's not just a case of going for a walk to forget it.

Many trans people who have been on HRT for years, and seen as successfully transitioned, still get gender dysphoria. All I can say is, the days you don't have it, live that day to the full. A day to remember, treat yourself, be yourself.

And the days it comes back, try and remember that good day you had, knowing that you will have them again.

**Shaving** is the worst. More so if your dark haired. I can shave in the morning, and then literally end of the day, the little fuckers are beginning to push thru my face again.

I've just spent the past few days plucking my facial hairs out... A very tedious thing to do. And painful, esp round the top lip parts. I finally finished last night, then afterwards I used my IDL device on my face, which I bought off Amazon for around ¬£70.

Just have to make sure you pull out as much of the root as possible. My plan is to stay on top of this. And hopefully the root will be so destroyed, it'll stop sproating darker hairs.

Of course there is laser treatment, but for me at least, for the mean time, that is pricey.

I also do the same with my upper body hairs.

However HRT, will over time lessen your body hairs.

**Voice training.** I don't know if you have a coach, or are following a guide. However I've found that if I try and copy a female singer that I like, her music, songs. And I sing along to them, just trying to minic. That can help some.

Your just over a month in. It can be frustrating. Give it time, you will start to see overall differences both in your physical self, as well as your emotions soon.
Thank you üíô I appreciate your kind words
This 100% describes what I have been feeling! That actually makes a lot of sense. Thank you.
Thank you so much üíô I really appreciate your response. Sometimes I wish I could just swap bodies with a trans man. Would save us both so much heartache and struggle lol‚Ä¶
Sorry that happened to you. You're obviously going through a difficult time in your life now. 
But it's usually not the case for most trans people.
OP, don‚Äôt listen to this person. They‚Äôre just going through their own stuff and trying to spread hate and scare you into detransitioning. You are a real woman OP, don‚Äôt detransition, don‚Äôt listen to this person.
No problem. It‚Äôs going to be ups, and downs but if you‚Äôre like me things will be better overall.
of course , anytime girl :) 
also .... I FEEL THIS !!! i want to swap like everything with a trans woman so bad , i would give you all of it so gladly üò©
Pretty sure they are a troll
Lol it‚Äôs so wild to me how trans men and trans women completely understand each other without understanding each other at all üòÇ. 

Thanks again for your comments. I‚Äôm feeling a little better already.
i think about that a lot , its wild üòπ glad we‚Äôre able to help each other though :)

My friend saw this on the application sheet for FedEx. I can't tell what they're trying to achieve here. Is my anger misplaced?		"No it's not misplaced. WTAF.
Who ever decided to use those words probably had a  room temperature IQ.
Was the ""race/ethnicity"" part of the form all slurs too?
Jesus, that‚Äôs like some 1960‚Äôs shit, your anger is totally justified. Like, if a trans person chooses to describe themself like that, whatever, but that the company choose to use that as the over arching term rather than just trans woman is a yikes. Also, if they‚Äôre gonna phrase it like that, I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd want them knowing that I‚Äôm trans.
There‚Äôs no way this form is from FedEx corporate.
That company claims diversity with the LGBT+ community but is very conservative
If this is true and not a joke target fedex it on twitter. Throw in like Vice and Out mag and ACLU and see the fur fly.  Add in pictures of the pages.
I can‚Äôt even.
It seems like some absurdly obvious transphobia to me. I never knew that Fedex tried pulling off stuff like this.
Looks like then have special forms for people like your friend
Okay thank you, my first instinct was incredulous rage and ""Somebody has to answer for this shit, what the hell?""
She sent another photo that included more sections. The options for race are Asian, Black, Caucasian, Native American, and Unknown. So uh... guess they don't allow people of Latin descent? Also one of the available choices for eye color was ""pink"". I'm starting to think/hope this thing is a bad translation of some kind
??
And that's a reasonable reaction
Even the word Caucasian is really outdated. I have no ancestry to the caucuses and I am whiter than white.
Is your friend trans?
Yeah I have a good few trans people I'm cool with I met online, aswell as being trans myself"	lt383m	trans	50	0.92	2021-02-26 17:42:11
Why do I feel culpable?	"Ok so I don‚Äôt speak to my ‚Äú mother ‚Äú at all. I blocked her everywhere except WhatsApp where I just activated an option which gets her appart of my other WhatsApp conversations and I don‚Äôt get pinged when she sends a message or whatever. 
I sometimes read what she sends and it‚Äôs always transphobic shit, but sometimes with a ‚Äú look how much I‚Äôm suffering because of you ‚Äú twist. And tonight I made the mistake to read her messages and I felt culpable as if I did something wrong even tho I know I didn‚Äôt.
 To be totally honest, I feel loads of anger and I hate her from the bottom of my heart since she misgenders me and use my fuc#ing deadname every message she sends, lies to everyone she knows, and acts as I was a horrible person juste because I‚Äôm f#cking trans which i didn‚Äôt even have a choice about ! I hate this situation, my family, and my life and myself to be honest. I didn‚Äôt have suicidal thoughts since some months, but they‚Äôre back because of her.

It‚Äôs more like a vent which I needed, but if you have any thoughts about what I can do, I‚Äôm interested."	"You feel culpable because she's an effective manipulator and has pushed the right buttons to make you feel that way. Best to just not even read her stuff, TBH.
Ok. Simple words of advice. I hope you can come to believe them.

You are not responsible for your emotions. Emotions are chemicals in the brain. They come and go. You *are* responsible for how you react to *your* emotions. You are responsible for your actions.

You. Are. Not. Responsible for *her* emotions, either. You are also not responsible for how she reacts to her emotions. She is responsible for her actions.

She's an adult. You are her kid. *You are not responsible for her emotions!*

As for practical, actionable advice. If it's at all possible to do so -- Block her on your phone. Make a rule to send her emails to a folder and mark them read. You can choose to look at them if you want, or never. Unfollow her on social media. Probably her friends, too. 

You didn't chose her as a mother, but you do get to eventually choose whom you will call your family.
You didn't do anything wrong, it's all her
Your buttons are being pushed because she‚Äôs the one who set them there. She‚Äôs raised you and therefore also knows your weaknesses and is exploiting them. It‚Äôs an absolutely terrible thing, hopefully you‚Äôre eventually able to completely go no contact with her and never have to think of her again. You deserve a stress free existence üíú
Block her on WhatsApp too and never read anything she sends you ever again. Source: I haven‚Äôt talked to my terrible mom in almost 7 years and it really helped my mental health. I understand the temptation but reading her toxic shit is just as bad as reacting to it. 
You might want to explore your very understandable anger towards her in therapy as well.
I have struggled with a lot of emotional manipulation my whole life due to guilt.  The most helpful thing I ever learned was that guilt is a weapon, it is abusive, it is not ok.  This website was helpful to me:  https://issuesiface.com/magazine/using-guilt-as-a-weapon.  This is a common way people consciously or subconsciously manipulate others.  I‚Äôm sorry it hurts, but your mother is going to have to learn to take responsibility for her issues before you can ever develop a level of healthy interactions.
Emotionally abusive people will make their issues and mistakes the other person's fault in order to have control and gain sympathy. So she's trying to make you feel bad and that the fact that you're trans is hurting her, which is unacceptable. 
Every rational person knows that being trans isn't a choice, and if they have difficulty accepting someone being trans then that is an issue that they have, need to acknowledge, and seek help. You're not responsible for her abusive behaviour, and you have no obligation to stay in contact with her or put up with her comments. If you know you've put as much effort into salvaging your relationship and it still doesn't get better, then you have no reason to continue having a relationship with her, regardless of relation. If she keeps texting you these horrendous messages, you have no obligation to respond, and you will be better without her. 
You're a strong person who should be valued and treasured by everyone in your life, and if they don't for a reason you can't control, then they shouldn't be in your life.
Ask why it's always about her?
I did it. I have a true family. They literally treat me as their two other children and I consider their said children as my brother and sister. But even with that it‚Äôs horribly hard. I feel like I‚Äôm alone, and it‚Äôs overwhelming for me
I finally took this decision thank to you. Thank you so much. I really needed someone who lived this to tell me it is ok and you did it. I can‚Äôt thank you enough
Wonderful! That's a good step. We need people who accept us for who we are with an unconditional positive regard. 

Moms are hard territory. Our biology is hardwired to want to love them. My god, the excuses I made for my mother...! She was a horrorshow, abusive, relentless. It took me years before I could admit that.

I don't know how easy it will be for you to start asserting these boundaries with her, but this is a marathon, not a sprint. Grief has its own timeline, you know. And this is a kind of loss.

It's okay to grieve the loss of this relationship. It's *healthy* to do so. Grieve what you wanted for a mother. Make damn sure you take this lesson to heart, too. Maybe one day, when things are stable, and you're established in your independent life, you'll be able to be the kind of person for another vulnerable individual that you wish your mother could have been for you.

Focus on your boundaries. You are not responsible for her emotions.
I am happy to hear that I helped. It‚Äôs okay to do this. You might feel really guilty in few weeks but power through it. Your mental health is more important"	u5w2lx	trans	48	0.93	2022-04-17 20:58:19
4 days into hrt question(MtF)	I'm feeling extremely moody. Like honestly, all day I've been sooo irritable and almost angry. Ok so first, 4 days seems kinda short to be feeling things. Is this all in my head? Idk this kind of irritation And anger is triggering for me. I just know myself so so well and am genuinely very in tune with my mind and body. This is not me. Should I be worried?	"all changes take time, but once you have a hormone saturating your system changes start, even if minor or slow. mental changes in particular can happen relatively quickly in some cases, since brain chemistry can work relatively quickly (think about sleeping meds, they wouldnt be particularly useful if they took multiple days to take effect). i dont think i can help much past that, but i can assure you that some effects of hrt can occasionally occur within the first couple days.
>I just know myself so well.


Yeah, HRT can change that. The hormonal shift changes how your brain works in subtle ways and essentially what happened for me, I had a whole new set of strange personality features that I'm still getting to know and accustomed to.

This is nornal and generally no reason for worry. But since these can be very scary, it's also the reason why behavioural therapy is generally recommended alongside HRT.

While the changes that happened to me are often bothersome, I don't dislike them because they do feel like a genuine part of me and fit very well into how I see myself and the kind of person I wanted to become, so if you're stressed out by how HRT changes you, that's a bad sign.

That said, while 3-4 days is around the expected time that the changes begin to occur, it's far from the end of it and you should expect far more severe behaviour shifts especially after 6-8 weeks. So before you decide anything drastic, it is advised you wait out the process for a little longer and talk to a therapist about your fears if possible.

Also, to alleviare your fears, It is not unlikely that the introduction of estrogen to your body can at first start to spike certain androgens and cause these feelings of anger. You should be able to expect this to naturally drop after a few more days.
For myself, I started getting more emotional after 4 days. Like crying over the littlest things. I‚Äôm over 2 weeks in and I still have that leaky eye problem. But I have also noticed other more positive effects too, like I‚Äôm starting to notice a shift in my thought patterns and generally a much happier outlook on life. Give it time and just refocus your energies to a more productive activity.
Everyone one in here is talking about being moody. I'm just over a week in and my mood sky rocketed immediately and just stayed there. Like my default emotion became joy. I have been crazy horny though. I was over here expecting to cry and have not yet. It has me a little worried.
Your body is adjusting to the new medication. I remember being incredibly horny the first week until it all leveled off. I felt more out of control than I did before starting hormones. After a little over a week, though, things settled down and some of the good changes started showing up. You might want to give it a little time just to see how you feel.
I also started recently and have dealt with the moodiness a couple days after, that and also just being way more tired. Think it‚Äôll just be a while till our bodies adjust to the changes
Probably not
i'm ftm but I remember that's exactly how i'd feel during my period, and i also went through something similar when i started t. i'm pretty sure it's just your body adjusting to the sudden change in hormones, or something like that lol
Thank you. Yeah, I think I was having an anxiety moment while I was typing the post. I'm still not liking the mood swings but I also understand this is going to take time to adjust. It's just so weird to go from being so calm cool and collected and logical all the time to all of a sudden so all over the map with my emotions. That's a good point about the sleep meds btw. I really appreciate it.
What hormones are you taking? :)
I am taking estradiol and anti-test (androcur)
and i hardly feel a difference in mood swings and i am 4 months in. Are you taking progesterone?
My doctor told me progesterone leads to really bad mood swings and thats why no one prescribes it in germany. There is also no evidence that progesterone has an effect."	u7ppx4	trans	40	0.95	2022-04-20 06:02:40
I don‚Äôt like waking up and remembering I‚Äôm trans	"When I first discovered I was LGBTQ+, I was so happy. I felt like my own person. Over the years I‚Äôve discovered more about myself and have been out as a trans demiboy for a while now. 

As time goes on and more days pass, I‚Äôve started to hate waking up and having to be me. Knowing that today I‚Äôll almost definitely run into someone who calls me a girl, who throws transphobic comments at me and knowing how difficult my future can be because I‚Äôm trans.

I wish I was cis. I wish I didn‚Äôt hate it so much when someone called me a girl. I just wish I was normal. 

This is partly a vent because of something that went down. A misogynistic transphobe made several comments about me saying they had ‚Äúno doubt I was a girl because I act the same as they do‚Äù Along with a few other comments, but that one stung no matter how much I tried to brush it off. I know I‚Äôm not a girl and don‚Äôt ‚Äúact like one‚Äù whatever that means.

Gender has to be associated with everything and I wish I didn‚Äôt care so much. 

I feel sick to my stomach and it‚Äôs hard to breathe. I am filled with so much hate and anger and sadness it‚Äôs eating away at me."	">‚Äúno doubt I was a girl *because I act the same as they do‚Äù*

""So you agree? Gender is a social construct used primarily to denote like attributes in people and assign them into groups?""

Chucklehead couldn't even realize he was actually pretty close to reality while trying to keep the facade of a bigot.

Honestly, I am so sorry this happened to you. For that bad memory, bad memories in the past, and the ones that will come in the future. Life isn't easy no matter what you do. If you were cis you'd have a totally different (and probably no less difficult) set of problems that would make you equally miserable. Nobody deserves all the crap they get thrown at them, and nobody deserves to have to put up with crap from other humans.

It will get easier with time. It may never get *easy* but it will get easier. You will get settled in more one way or the other. The question is who you want to 'get settled in to.' If you have to get comfortable being someone, who do you want to be comfortable as? If you're going to get harassed, you might as well get harassed for being something you want to be or doing something you want to do.
I feel for you hun. I hate waking up as...this. Knowing that no matter what i do, it'll never be enough. Never. I hate this and i hate me. Being cis would be so so so much easier. üò≠
I am so sorry you feel this way and my wish not just for you but for everyone is that we as a society become more tolerant and realise that what someone else does, that doesn't effect you, DOESN'T EFFECT YOU!
Thank you for the nice words, but please don‚Äôt call me hun? 


I‚Äôve been feeling a bit better since I wrote this. I always get really panicked and anxious at night. Still have that sadness and anger inside but it‚Äôs easier to handle during the day, you know?

Has anyone seen the kis throwing the desk?	"I am honestly so frustrated by this. That kid deserves SO much better. They shouldn't be misgendered. I understand how bad it is as a nonbinary person. I just wanna cry from anger. I just wish people were more accepting.

I meant kid in the title I was just angry typing-"	"That video was hard to watch. The frustration in their voice, the overwhelming amount of transphobia in the comments... Trans people are just a joke to them. And people are going to watch that video and laugh and think ""This is why no one takes you people seriously"" and my heart just shatters. I'm fortunate enough as a trans person to pass and not be misgendered, but it's so frustrating seeing how many people can't share in that privilege because society has its head so far stuck up its ass that it's apparently imperative to bully kids who are just asking for basic respect
I haven‚Äôt but im interested, Whats is it?
i saw that tik tok and it honestly broke my heart. i hope those kids that misgendered them stub their toe everyday, in the same place, and his best friend has to see it happen everyday while he also stubs his toe.
Yeah- it sucks how they were being mocked for a pretty understandable reaction- I hope they were able to get some help to stop the bullying

based on the comments, if I'd have seen that video, i probably would've punched my phone out of frustration. no one should be treated like that.
I just wanna cry angry tears because of this video. I feel so bad for that kid. I understand getting misgendered, I do constantly everywhere. I even get dead named a lot. And it's just so frustrating to watch another trans person suffering with that
Basically off camera this kid was misgendering the kid, and I assume much more than just that day. The kid got angry (understandably), and the kid threw the desk while yelling ""I'm not a girl"" 

Some people are blaming the kid throwing the desk and saying they over reacted
If it was the first time being misgendered, then ya that is a bit of an overreaction 

But the way the kid pulled out their phone to record, they knew the kid would have a reaction
It's for this very reason I never correct my customers, ever. It sucks.
God that is awful. I feel like that would‚Äôve happened to me if i came out in high school, I was a very anger and self conscious child. It breaks my heart to see someone bullied like that.
This kid is like 15 btw. It's so stupid that 15 year Olds don't understand that everyone has their own identity and to just respect it
If they‚Äôre anything like the people I went to school with then i wouldn‚Äôt expect any better. I think schools should do more to educate on this topic
Most definitely they should. But younger kids should be more accepting
I feel like they're a product of their environment, if we educated them they would be more accepting. It is appalling that people let this happen.
You would think. I was in high school 10 years ago, overwhelmingly white lower-middle class vocational school. One kid was just flamboyantly gay and he was relentlessly harassed by the ""men's men"" who were in welding, auto repair, and other hands on professions. The teachers at that school leaned conservative too. So it all depends on environment and what messages they're taught.

I was talking to my younger sister recently, she's in middle school NOW. She says they don't teach a whole lot about gender or different identities, but she's learned pretty much all of it from online and talking to friends. She has a lesbian friend, a bi friend, and she knows about trans people and it's more normal for her. Although, she mentioned ""it seems like all the boys in my grade are straight."" I explained statistically speaking there was probably just as much diversity as the girls, but young boys are under more pressure to ""not act feminine,"" and adhere to masculine ideals."	xdkv1j	trans	40	0.9	2022-09-13 22:35:57
Transphobes are funny sometimes	"Uh Cw for transphobic/homophobic stuff

here are some of my favorite transphobic/homophobic quotes that are funny to me but warning cause they're transphobic but they just make me laugh



- ""oh she's bisexual so she can feel all the emotions, since men can only feel anger and women can feel everything besides anger.""

- ""wow everyone is so homophobic to me and I'm not even gay"" (this person then proceeded to use the f slur 3 different times) 

- ""Saying I cant like men and be straight is sexist"" - probably a gay amab in denial

- ""I feel like society is pushing us [cishet amabs] to be either gay or bisexual you know?"" 

That's all I have now hope you guys find them as funny as I do, I think some people are just confused so if by some chance anyone here knows anyone who said these quotes or knows anyone who says anything like them don't make fun of them instead just explain what being lgbtq is like so they're less confused.

Well, I still present myself as a man and if that person saw me with my wife, they would be very confused lol. I'm far more emotional than her, even before I admitted being trans to myself.

>‚Ä¢ ""I feel like society is pushing us [cishet amabs] to be either gay or bisexual you know?"" 

I thought I was cishet until around one month ago and honestly, I never felt pushed to be anything but a cis straight man and , by accepting being a trans, I'm actually going against those impositions.

People broke Covid rules, just to avoid sitting with me at lunch today :'(	" 

So, I work in news. And with this week being Christmas, they are doing ""nice"" things for us each day this week (minus Friday for some stupid reason). Today's ""nice"" thing was a pretty average meal from a food truck, about 2 hours after I would've liked to eat.

What really gets me (beyond the food being nothing to be excited for) is that because of Covid and the new surge from Omicron (and probably some people being exposed here), we have to wear masks and go back to social distancing, despite us all being required to be fully vaccinated / boostered.

Now, the covid stuff is fine, its whatever at this point. But they are now not allowing us to eat at our desk (I'm a producer and thus extremely busy and never have time to take a lunch), and instead eat in the garage at one of three tables.

The icing on the cake? Literally no one sat with me, while the other two tables broke the rules and sat multiple people at them. The one manager that did try to sit with me, didn't even sit down before swapping tables to the ""popular"" one.

I'm usually a very solitary person (I prefer to be alone), but this just felt like a slap in the face. I'm fighting back a mixture of anger and deep sadness, and just trying to keep my shit together, but I'm yelling and being snippy at coworkers.

I hate feeling like this."	"Oh my God, this reminds me of high school so much. Adults *still* do this crap??? Trust me, none of them are worth being your friend. I, for a brief moment in high school, was mildly popular, and I sat at a ""popular"" table. Eventually, they all dwindled away from me, until I was left with one person. She is still my best friend today, and this was 3 years ago. Just be patient, coming from a confused-gender autistic person. :)

You should see this in a positive light - why would you *want* assholes like that sitting with you in the first place? Imagine the conversations. It would be most likely be dreadful even if you weren't trans.
Adults ABSOLUTELY do childish things like this. Adult body does not mean adult emotions.
I've self diagnosed myself as being on the autism spectrum (i guess it's called level 1 these days) so i have always had issues with self esteem and trying to fit in but also never really wanting to go with the crowd.

I didn't actually want any company because people are messy and complicated. But seeing other people break rules just to not be near me felt like an off handed attack.

I don't do relationships like most people. I've burnt almost every single bridge with someone in my life. I don't really have friends beyond the one person i see once a year when he comes to visit family.

I don't *want* a relationship with people at work. They're just cogs in the machine like me. I goto work to get the job done, not be your friend. Always been that way. But it hurts seeing other people have stuff like this.

And i seriously can't take time to eat or I'll never finish my work and get fired. News is cutthroat and Indiana is an at will state.

Thanks for your thoughts tho.

I'm about to send this to my transphobic best friend. Wish me luck. CW: Mentions of Transphobia and mental illness	"My best friend of five years called to ask me about why I changed my pronouns in my bio and confronted me about being trans. This is my response to that conversation. I've been crying for almost two hours and could really use the support right now. Thank you.

&#x200B;

""Hey. I just want to apologize for not being strong enough to say this out loud but I knew this would happen eventually. I‚Äôm not one for long, sappy novels of text and I know you aren‚Äôt either so I‚Äôll try to make it as brief as I can.

Firstly I just want to say that I am thrilled that you said you would be willing to consider using a different name and set of pronouns for me. That is wonderful to hear and it made a spark of joy. For that I thank you. However, like that comment, there are some strings attached. I don‚Äôt mean to be rude but by saying things like ‚ÄúI can try but I‚Äôll never see you any different- and I don‚Äôt think I could even if I tried‚Äù, ‚ÄúIf it makes you comfortable that‚Äôs alright‚Ä¶ but I want don‚Äôt want to be uncomfortable, ya know?‚Äù, ‚ÄúNormally my approach to these things is just to not associate with it.‚Äù causes a slew of emotion for me. On one hand I understand your perspective. This isn't considered normal. This is something that is unfortunately considered taboo in many parts of the world. Though on the other hand it makes me feel ways that offended simply cannot cover. It breaks my heart. It fills me with rage. It makes me want to break down, cry, curl into a ball, and hide away in a dark corner forever. To me you aren‚Äôt just saying these things. You‚Äôre telling me that you will NEVER, in any capacity, see me as I see myself. You are telling me that no matter how hard I try I will never reach my goal of becoming something I know I already am- and that even if you lie to yourself, you'll never truly perceive me for my true self. On top of that, if lying to yourself doesn‚Äôt work you can always just pretend I don‚Äôt exist and that we never knew each other. That hurts. A lot.

I know what you mean when you say that you‚Äôll never see me any different. I understand your confusion. However I ask that you please try to see mine. Everyday I wake up with a numbing buzz in my head. Over the past several years, and even since I was a little kid I always knew something was different about me from the other boys. I always got along better with my female classmates, I grew my hair super long, I painted my nails- hell in 9th grade I did a drag show and LOVED presenting femme. I didn‚Äôt understand it then. Countless nights of dreaming of simply living as a girl would make me so happy. I‚Äôve always hated my body but I never understood why. I used to think it was because of my surgeries, but after years of counseling for that I came to find that I was okay with my surgeries. I still hated my body though. I still do to be honest.

When I was a child I used to have an imaginary friend named Jenny. She started coming around when I was really little and she would age with me as I grew. Jenny was one of my only friends I had in my early school years. She was stabbed through the heart and said that she was a version of myself from a past life. Whenever I would get scared, or sad, or angry she would comfort me and say that things were going to be okay. Eventually, one night she stopped showing up. Her voice was lost to me. I got so confused. She was everything I wanted to be. She was smart, sweet, strong, brave, caring, and beautiful. As the years went by my shoulders broadened, my voice lowered, I started growing facial hair and I hated all of it. My body was changing and forcing itself into something I didn‚Äôt want. As it changed, so did I. I became angry, confused, scared- at times even violent, reckless, and dangerous. I didn‚Äôt give a shit about my body because why should I? It‚Äôs not what I wanted. I felt like radio-static forcibly sealed into an ugly meat sack.

It wasn‚Äôt until after high school when I got away from all the forced relationships and false sense of what was important that fully I realized that I was trans. Checking out some communities, doing research, speaking with doctors, and several appointments would lead me to look back and piece together why I had so much anger boiling inside of me. I recently have begun to speak with a new doctor about HRT and...to be honest...I‚Äôve already started. I‚Äôve been on it for about three months. I have felt more alive in these past three months than I ever have. Nowadays I wake up excited to see what the day brings. Everyday is one step closer to becoming the amazing woman I was born to be.

If you get a chance I would like you to look up the terms ‚ÄúGender Dysphoria‚Äù ‚ÄúGender Euphoria‚Äù and ‚ÄúDissociation‚Äù. That is a much better way of explaining it. It‚Äôs unending. I don‚Äôt expect you to understand, I just ask that you try to keep an open mind.

I‚Äôm so happy that you are willing to take these things into consideration but I need you to understand that this is something I‚Äôm going to do regardless of anyone's input because it‚Äôs for myself. I need to do this to live a truly fulfilling life. If you aren‚Äôt comfortable I understand but I am not going to keep myself repressed for the comfort of others anymore. You are one of my family. I will always think of you as such, and I will always support you on your journeys. Even if our paths should eventually part ways. I do truly care about you with all of my heart, and I hope to continue to know you for many years to come. I understand if you need time to process however. I think I might need to do some as well.

Your friend,

Lindsey (Formerly known as \*\*\*\*)"""	"That is very well said:)

A big hug for you! 

I know making these kinds of letters can be exhausting emotionally! 

You obviously care a lot about your friend and i really hope he turns his lack of knowledge into  supportive wisdom:)
The part where you talk about your imaginary friend burst me into tears. I feel it in my bones right now. A lot of people used to have imaginary friend during childhood, and they were always so conforting. But now they are just memories and I can't even remember when they stoped existing.

I imagined you transitioning and being able to see Jenny again, appearing in the mirror, smiling at you with tears of joy and euphoria.   


You deserve to be loved. I know your friend might sound a bit close minded, but I'm sure you will become a wonderful woman. And you'll prove him how wrong he was.

Am I selfish?	"Im a 15 yr old trans male kid, and I feel like all ive ever done or said to my parents were selfish. 

When i first came out to them they were absolutely disgusted and pinned all the blame on my best friend, we got seprated until 18 for that reason. And calling us animals or that we have been influenced by ""worldly people""

 I cant get out of the religion thats been hurting me a lot because they keep saying its ""to help you be happy again"" and since im a minor i have no choice. Im a straight guy, which means in their view im a lesbian. 
And they keep telling me my penalty for this is death, a punishment fron god. Along with being shunned by your friends and family until you ""wake up"". I have a kid-friend in this religion that looks up to me. Im feel too guilty to leave him behind. And in his eyes it would be betrayal, hes a sweet kid and i dont want to disappoint him either. 

But at the same time I've been getting what ive asked for. If i ask if i could buy manga they would or supplies and shirts that i like. I feel like i should be happy for what i have, and be glad im not born in a family who suffers from poverty or have my parents divorced. But I cant feel happy, what they want in exchange as repayment is me realizing my wrong. 

But i actually disobeyed their specific rule of never talking of facing my only best friend, by finding ways online. My friend didnt do anything wrong, he may have had anger issues with his dad but he always had a soft spot. And it was an agreement on both parents since we are cousins. 

Could I just be arrogant? Am i really just that selfish to be rather be sad about my gender and the type of religious lifestyle they chose on me when i have it all?"	"It‚Äôs great that they are happy to help you pursue your interests and get you things that you want, but that doesn‚Äôt excuse their homophobic/transphobic behaviour. They may be trying to do what‚Äôs best for you, but they are instead harming you by cutting you off from the support of friends and trying to instil shame in you identity. Asking them to respect your identity and allow you to see your friends is not selfish at all, it‚Äôs really the bare minimum. If I were you, I‚Äôd make it very clear to them that if they‚Äôre not willing to treat you with dignity, you‚Äôre not willing to remain a part of the family.
You are not selfish at all.  
Trying to get you to change your gender identity is a [conversion attempt](https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/assets/resources/just-as-they-are-sept2017.pdf).  

No parent should call their child names like animal, when they are questioning their gender identity or sexuality. Neither should they for coming out. That is a very toxic reaction.   
So is seperating you from your best friend. It‚Äòs a good thing you seek some emotional support. Hopefully you can find it irl, too.  

There are plenty of religious groups within every religion that support lgbt+ people. You could look for a support group within your own religion. Some of them help connect with parents and help them accept you.  
It is a choice to hate queer folks.
I don't think you're being selfish, you're simply trying to live that is all
You definitely aren't selfish. When it comes to things that affect your mental health you need to do what's best for you.
You deserve to be allowed to be who you are without being coerced or shamed or insulted for it. You are a minor and a dependent under their financial control, and sure it‚Äôs nice that they are giving you money to pursue some interests that does not excuse anything else. 
My best advice for dealing with your family is to start making plans now for how to get financially independent as quickly as possible so that they cannot continue to hold leverage and control over you. 
When I left religion it was difficult for similar reasons. Everything was so enmeshed. Members of my youth group were like siblings we‚Äôd spent so much time together. I was shamed and made to feel like I was hurting and abandoning people for leaving faith. It‚Äôs not your fault. You didn‚Äôt ask or agree to be put into that church family, and you do not owe them your continued presence or endurance of a setting and system that does not affirm you. If you are worried about your younger friend, stay in touch with them. Be honest with them when you are able about why you‚Äôre leaving and encourage them to decide for themselves what‚Äôs best for them. 
You are not selfish, you deserve to be happy and comfortable and respected and are allowed to leave places and relationships that don‚Äôt make you feel respected.
You are definitely not the selfish one in this equation. 
They sound like they're gas lighting you more than anything. And you sound much more capable of seeing both sides and empathy than them. Sorry parents but... üò¨
Sweetie the fact that you feel guilty and selfish for simply wanting to be who you are is a sign of abuse/manipulation to begin with.

There is no death penalty or punishment from god for being any sort of LGBTQ+ and you deserve to get out if that. You are not selfish. You are not arrogant. You are hurting because you have to suppress who you are. If you can‚Äôt be yourself, you don‚Äôt ‚Äúhave it all‚Äù in the slightest.

You deserve more than this. You deserve to be you and there is nothing wrong with you. ‚ù§Ô∏è
You aren't selfish, if anything your parents are the selfish ones trying to repress who you are
The selfish ones are the parents, giving you the stuff you want, and using it as a tool to shame you for ""betraying"" them.

""But we gave you so mush stuff, and this is how you treat us?!"" No, stuff may be nice, but giving things as long as you behave isn't loving parenting.

And trying to turn you straight/cis is abuse. Simple as that.
Sounds like your parents are cunts. If it helps, it‚Äôs not selfish to want to have a social life and identity you feel comfortable with.
Is it bad enough for you to call CPP?
Thank you sm this means a lot. Ill take your advice
Im unsure
That's a bad sign.

In my experience like 70% of ""I don't knows"" are ""I need to get out of this situation but I'm too awkward or feel too bad to actually say it needs to stop"".
Thats.... accurate. Is there another way?
I don't know. Growing up I never knew CPP services was an option and I didn't know enough about what normal parents were supposed to be like to know how bad it was.

CPP might not take it seriously if it's just verbal abuse. The only thing you can do I try. I'm sorry things suck so much and I wish I had a better solution.
Oh no this is fine thank you, means a lot"	semchk	trans	32	0.87	2022-01-28 08:52:15
"Sometimes, I feel like an idiot for defending transgender people and the trans experience. Because transphobia is ""okay"" since ""it's just facts"" to a lot of people. Sometimes, I forget that we're NOT subhuman and we DESERVE to be treated equally and with respect. ...I could use a reminder, please."	"***TW: Transphobia, Negative Internal Thoughts, Trans Doubts, Other...***

\-x-

Please don't take this the wrong way. I beg you. 

I just need help... A reminder, a lift of spirits, a thumbs up, I don't know. Just, something to help me out, here.

My ranting in this post, hopefully, will aid in getting things off my chest. I apologize *profusely* if you're hurt, offended, or angered by what's said in this post. It's not my intention to do such things to you. Please be safe.

\-x-

I'm not new to transphobia. I've been out since I was ten, over a decade as I'm turning twenty-three in exactly two weeks time. So, you'd think I'd be used to this by now, yeah? That transphobia rolls off my back by this time...

Usually, it does.

For some reason, today, it has not.

I was on a relatively popular subreddit earlier this morning, just scrolling through, when there was a post that asked, ""Straight guys, would you still be 'straight' if you dated a *transgendered* woman?""

Naturally, my answer would be ""no"". And naturally, I think people can identify however they wish to. When I saw misinformed commenters saying ""that ain't straight"" or ""hell nooooo you're not straight if you date a dude"", I rushed in to defend these hypothetical people. I wasn't saying anything rude, not anything aggressive, just giving my opinion on the matter and telling these commenters that people can identify how they wish, and since *they* aren't dating this hypothetical transgender woman, why should they get a say in how the couple defines their sexuality?

I was then told, ""You're so brainwashed, it's sad.""

At first, it didn't bother me. But after more back-and-forth (something I'm sure you can find in my comments history since it was just a few hours ago, if you *really* want to read the since-deleted post), I...had some intrusive thoughts.

'What if they're right?'

'What if I'm just seriously mentally ill, and being trans is mental illness?'

'What if I'm not actually trans?'

'What if everyone who's told me I'm sick, or stupid, or deranged, or am no better than an anorexic starving themselves, is right?'

For a bit, I tried to remind myself that *anyone* would crack under the pressure of abuse, that gaslighting makes *anybody* think they're in the wrong when, in fact, they're not. And for some time, I tried to remember that I'm perfectly content and *happy* with my gender and my identity before transphobes come in, and they're just making my doubt myself. Because I feel so normal and so *good* with myself on an average, everyday basis.

But then those thoughts come back. Over, and over, and over.

Suddenly, shame comes over me, because I'm embarrassed that I tried to defend trans people. ""Maybe I *am* brainwashed."" I think. ""God, I look like an absolute fucking *moron* to them."" And not just the commenters, but others, too, because I hit negative downvotes pretty easily.

...I don't know where I'm going with this, admittedly.

Every time I feel happy with myself, and happy about my life, something else comes swooping in to knock me flat on my ass. It's not always transphobia like this, of course. This time, it just so happens to be. And this time, it's really fucking me up, for some reason. Making me doubt everything I felt okay about.

I'm just tired.

How do I help myself? Help myself heal, and be okay with who I am? I need my thick skin back, but healing from traumas requires you to become emotionally squishy so you can regain your sense of self that may have been lost due to drawing into yourself. So, how can I be okay with me if people *hate* me?

I know I'm supposed to have...*pride* over who I am, over *what* I am, but I don't. I don't, because everyone who beats me down with their words seem right to me, now, and everyone who stands up for trans people look like ""crazy liberal snowflakes"", in my eyes. The internalized transphobia is a cancerous growth in my chest, and no matter how many times I try to remind myself, tell myself, and *prove* to myself that those assholes are wrong about me, I just... It doesn't work...

\-x-

Below is more of me rambling, unrelated to this post and being trans. You can ignore it if you want since it's not pertinent to the above situation, but I just didn't have the heart to delete it. It's more ""woe is me"" shit, so really, it's just...whatever.

>!There hasn't been a day that's gone by where I haven't fought. Decades of abuse - sexual, physical, emotional, and mental - that began the day I was born, have seemingly worn down on me, weathering my resolve.!<

>!My mom said I was born with fire in my veins; I had to have been, because she was sick with cancer while pregnant with me, and I was supposed to be dead upon birth or, at most, severely mentally and physically handicapped.!<

>!But I wasn't. I'm okay.!<

>!I survived just to experience a decade of childhood sexual assault from multiple people, abuse from my own family and friends, bullying for nearly twenty years of schooling, seething self-hatred from both society and from myself for being weird, and trans, and so many other things...!<

\-x-

**TL;DR - How do you overcome self-hatred and internalized transphobia when society's majority keeps shoving it onto you? How do you keep standing up when you just end up getting knocked down, again, and again, and again?**"	"All I can say is the internet is a disgusting place. People hurl insults and say things without even thinking about what it means, or how it could hurt someone. 

I try to stick to trans subreddits where I'm with my own like-minded people. I suggest the same for you. Or at least avoid obvious harmful posts like the one you mentioned. 

I also like to remind myself on how stupid CIS people are when it comes to trans topics. CIS people think we're crazy because they are comfy in their own identity and don't feel how we feel. You can't expect them to know how we feel and what we go through. They know nothing because they don't experience what we do. They say, ""oh yeah, I'd never like a transwoman, that's gay!"" They see them as sex objects and not for the brave, incredible and amazingly beautiful women they are. And frankly those types of CIS people aren't worth your time of day. (Because a real trans person wouldn't even fuck them to begin with, lol)

I actually went through a period myself after browsing a very dark and very heavy transphobic thread thinking I was delusional and ill too. But I talked to my doctor about it and he said that trans people certainly aren't delusional. And he's right. 

Nobody would give HRT, surgeries or even provide trans rights to kids if we were delusional. We're not. We're simply people who are working towards who we truly are on the inside, and it doesn't make us any less of a person. I actually think trans people are some of the bravest and strongest. We learn so much, and change so much. Like a fucking butterfly! (Lol) It takes metaphorical BALLS to realize who you are, and to decide you're going to do something about it! 

If you feel like you're a woman, YOU. ARE. A. WOMAN. If you feel like a man, YOU. ARE. A. MAN. It doesn't matter how you dress or act. You are you. And you're fucking beautiful. 

You're obviously going through really heavy stuff right now. I can't give advice for your past or things with your mum. (Therapy, therapy, therapy.) But we can only keep on being ourselves. I'm here if you need to chat, O.P. Though I don't know how much I can help. At the end of the day I think it's most important to just be your true self and do it unapologetically. You'll always run into assholes, even within the trans community. It's just a sad fact. You need some good friends to lean on when down, and funny things to read when hurting. (I literally LIVE for transgendercirclejerk. Funniest shit IMO and watching them mock shitty CIS people always makes me feel better.)

I love you, O.P. ‚ô•Ô∏è
Sometimes I feel this way too because of how much transphobia is pumped around us. It makes me feel absolutely horrible and disgusted with myself when I find myself ""agreeing"" with shit used specifically to hurt me. However, I'm aware that they're stemming from internalised transphobia that may pop up ironically BECAUSE of dysphoria.

Think about it though, these are *cis* people's opinions and rhetorics. Here's a reminder: we're human beings. We are beautifully diverse in so many ways. There's no right or wrong when it comes to expressing gender and sexuality. All sorts of contact and intimacy we have with other human beings is just that ‚Äî contact. It is NOT dictated by the way our body looks or what we're born as.

Next, we invented the concept of gender. Chromosomes are real, and they go beyond XY and XX, too! But gender is a *social* construct and not a biological fact. People aren't born knowing whether they're men or women until these concepts are introduced to them at a young age; it is after we learn what gender is that we understand what we're feeling. What we describe as gender is a certain inner feeling that *does* exist but I'm not gonna go into the specifics right now, it's just that society has defined it the way it did and that it ended up causing issues like sexism, and it is the root of dysphoria.

I repeat, we all express ourselves differently. Forget gender for a second. Imagine a world without gender. I'm sure every person, cis or trans, would still want to express themselves the way the currently want to, whether it's wearing a dress or doing this or that. So think about: transphobes are weirdos in this case. Do you see where I'm going with this?

Sometimes I believe what they say. Sometimes I worry that I'm a delusional deviant for existing. Sometimes I worry that they are right about the brainwashing thing, so I remind myself of the stuff I said above. I might believe the words that go along ""you're having pride over being a disgusting unusual freak"" but they're not true! You deserve kindness, so please treat yourself gently. To relieve yourself for a moment, think of your identity in terms of how you want to express yourself as a human being instead of in terms of gender or physical attributes, maybe that would help a bit.
*virtual hug*




I sometimes feel this way, like maybe this is the best elaborated cult but when i look back and read the stories i know im in the right place. 




Im used to deal with misinformed people it is what it is, i consider myself very logical and i think other persons who are teached about trans persons will think the same as me




It is definitely a shock all mental difficulties are hard to get a grasp on because is not really tangible you have to hear it with strong conviction from multiple sources cause at first its easy to dismiss it as crazy talk. But we are here we are real our memories and feelings are there, im sure one day every one will understand cause you can't change what you are,
Hey I definitely do not have all the answers here but one thing I can say is that you deserve some kindness - from others, but especially from yourself.


Me personally I try to stay out of online arguments. I find even if I'm right I still feel like shit afterwards.
Heyyyy.
I'm so sorry about how you are feeling.
Some people suck, that's all I can say. Other comments on this very post would put it much better than I ever could.

I will remind you that you deserve respect, we all do. All we want to be is ourselves, and we take crap about it from people who dont have the capacity to understand.

Nothing we can do will prove our validity to them. We deserve better. You deserve better. You're great. I hope this helps. *hug*
Those assholes receive their talking points from organized groups dead-set on keeping the trans community in the shadows, not allowing us to be empowered like the gay folks have been recently.  Of course they ""make sense"", that's the point of their operation.  Stand strong and don't fall for it.
Being transgender, to me, is like being intersex. Your characteristics don't match. Your mental view of your sex and gender doesn't match how your body developed. It is biological in nature, just like being born intersex is.

The mind is just as real as the body and is influenced just the same. I mean, look at different conditions. One I can think of where something physical impacts something mental is fragile X syndrome. One of the X chromosomes is different, and it leaves a mental impact on the baby (usually described as learning difficulties). My sister has this. It shows that physical things can affect how your mental state presents itself. And honestly, what other explanation is there than that transness comes from something physical that altered the way your mental state was formed? Maybe it was hormones in the womb. Maybe it was genetic. Maybe both. Who knows, but I do know that being trans is not a choice, and is medical in nature.

And with this in mind, there's only 2 theoretical treatments.

1: would be to change the mental landscape to match the body, which is what conversion therapy has tried to do and has failed consistently, every single time, and only caused more harm. So that's not an option.

2 is to change the body to match the mental landscape, through surgery or hormones or whatever else you please. This has been shown to work time and time again, yet somehow we are still not provided it very easily.
you have to remember that 99% of what people hear about trans people is misinformation spread by malicious people in positions of power. before my egg cracked, I thought trans women were gross, didn't know that hrt was even a thing, and I thought it was just a fetish. flash forward to now, I know better, but only because I've done my research and confided in mine and others' experiences. most people just repeat what they hear, and it's just downright sad because it's really not their fault, they've just been fed lies by people that want to hurt us

If i had the oppertunity to talk to jk rowling i would tell her...	"You were my hero, i first experienced harry potter at the age of 5, sat next to my big brother for a movie night we watched the philosophers stone, and at that moment i was hooked on the magic and the euphoric feeling i got watching every single movie. i wanted to be just like you when i grew up. the chance to have your influence, to write books to young people just like how i was, to tell them that its okay to feel different and to not fit in with what society tell us we have to be.

Every day for years i watched your movies i read all of your books, i bought costumes and i joined communities of people who were just like me, a feeling i had never felt before, and i didnt feel as different. every time we had to do presentations in school about who 'our hero' was i would talk about you. how your books gave me just a little bit of comfort while dealing with a difficult home life, struggling with my queer identity and the fact that i just didnt understand why i couldnt be like all the other girls my age. why i couldnt just put on a dress and makeup and be pretty like everyone else. but my mum always assured me that i had nothing to worry about, ""its just a phase"" because when im a teenager il start liking all of that.

and then i became a teenager. and nothing changed. but watching harry potter would make everything okay, my own personal escape from reality. i would watch the movies for hours on end. but in particular one specific quote truly stuck by me 'being different isnt always a bad thing' from luna lovegood, i didnt beleive it though. self hatred and confusion over why i felt the way i did repeated in my head each day.  but, in my worst moment when i felt the world was crumbling down around me, i would pull out the prisoner of azkaban, sit down, and for two hours everything would feel okay.

Then, at the age of 14 i woke up to find that my hero who i looked up to my entire life hated me. i hadnt come out yet just only beginning to accept that i may be trans, yet still extremely internally transphobic. and like salt to my wound. the person i had spent my entire life admiring and hoping to be just like told the world that me, and everyone like me, is a danger; to women, to society. to what is 'normal'. i was devastated, i didnt feel anger, just dissapointment and sadness that the one person who i beleived to be the kindest and most caring person of all wished i did not exist.

i havent gotten rid of the books or movies. but i havent touched them either. im not sure whats stopping me, maybe the special memories they hold of that magical feeling from when i was young, and that thowing them away would be like throwing away that massive part of my childhood. but they just sit on a shelf in the corner of my room, gathering dust. yet every so often i catch a glimpse of them, and im reminded of you, 'my hero'."

5 years of trans-thinking, a reflection	"It was on a late summer day of August 2012 when it happened. I had been pulled in for a visit to a step-relative at the flip side of my country together with my mother and sister, a visit I really did not want to do, but was coaxed in to doing it anyways. Oh well, I thought, it'll only be the weekend. And besides, I would be bringing my laptop with me that would serve as my distraction. Off I went.

At the time I was a lost, lost person. The little I knew about myself was hampered by a life-long struggle against insecurity and anxiety. Oh, the anxiety was a mess. I never got any proper, ""official"" help for it (which consequently built up as anger inside me). High school was about to end, too, and the pressure to figure your life out, so quickly, was overwhelming. I dealt with this by being my true self, online. It included pretending to be a woman a few times. Unbeknownst to me, it was the perfect set-up for a meltdown.

It happened during the visit. One of the top posts of /r/lgbt of that day appeared on my front page. It was a drawing of various gendered people promoting love and kindness. It led me to /r/asktransgender. I'm sure, if brains could make noises, it would do a loud click with gears rotating shortly after. My first reaction then was, ""Wait, you are allowed to do this?!"" - turns out, yeah, you are.

It shattered a lot of my self-imposed limits. It wasn't even just about the gender, but the concept of taking control of your own life. To experiment and try things out. To make your own choices. It just happened to be about gender this time. It felt like the only open road I could go on to explore myself. So, I did.

It inevitably messed my life up in bad and good ways. My high school was delayed a year. My mental state did a complete meltdown. I changed identity and dropped everyone I knew. But, on the flip side: I became myself, if only with tiny steps. From hormones and from experience. The initial turbulent years could've gone so much more smoother, but it gave me a solid base that I can't set a price tag on.

My parents initially denied my ""phase"". The gender diagnosis didn't arrive until *three* years later after I had applied for help. And it was only then when they suspected I had a problem other than with gender identity. Last year I got a diagnosis in the autistic spectrum and had legal rights to get help for it. I also got an official prescription for hormones. So there's that.

I also kept doubting whether if I was ""trans enough"", seeing as I never felt an overwhelming feeling of being a woman. I never had the typical history of a transgender person, and I never thought about going further than hormones. This led me to try, over and over, to be more female than I actually felt.

I just waited, waited, and waited for the turbulent years to be over. And eventually, it did. I no longer feel obligated to pick either female, or male. I feel comfortable going with just hormones, with an androgynous voice, and with a feminine appearance. I feel secure in myself, not just my gender but with everything, and that really is a wonderful feeling.

I guess I'm writing all of this as a reflective piece for myself, and for all of you. One day, five years ago, I also worried whether I would pass or not. I also worried about hormones, about surgery, and about feeling safe and secure in yourself. And I'd like to say that it is possible to someday feel happy with yourself, even for you. You can someday feel hopeful for the future. You can someday feel happy that you get to experience this life.

Just find people who loves and supports you regardless of your choices. The rest will sort itself out with time."	"Not feeling ""trans enough"" is something I can relate to.
Lovely. Thank you for sharing your journey. :)
This was beautiful to read.
I can really relate to ask much in this.  Thank-you for sharing your story!"	6ldyh5	trans	31	0.97	2017-07-05 13:19:05
I just started HRT finally	"After years  of depression, anxiety,  anger,  dealing with gender dysphoria , with some doctors who made go from there to there and delaying my hrt even further,  I said enough is enough,  I was at some point where my mental state was pretty bad because of this,  and in a desperation I managed to obtain androcur and proginova on my own. 

Don't know if this is placebo or it's real , today took my second dose and suddenly my body,  my brain became so chill and I'm so calm,  even have a nice warm feeling through my body,  my depression,  anxiety,  anger,  all those started to slowly fade away leaving me in a nice sense of peace,  my mind is suddenly so neutral now , I no longer ruminate my thoughts... everything seems much better now. 

I don't know why I experience this , placebo or not , something really happened in my brain,  everything is so surreal,  it's like a dream,  and starting hrt is probably the best thing I ever did in my life. 


Dosages are : Androcur 12.5 mg a day/ 2mg Proginova"	"My brain winded down as soon I started hrt too, it's been peaceful ever since.
It's so nice.
Well done, congrats on this big step ü•≥
Starting a hrt is a great achievement and as we are all anxious everything calms down and becomes as we dream.  It is not a placebo, it is simply your brain understanding that you have allowed yourself to be who you really are.  Congratulations and keep us updated on the changes!
Then I'm not alone hahaha"	m8ec4c	trans	27	0.97	2021-03-19 10:31:11
Mtf hrt changes in thinking and behavior.	"So I‚Äôve (24f) been on hrt for right about 7 months, and I see a whole ton of stuff on the physical changes but significantly less on the internal side of things. Just wanted to put this out there and see if these things seem pretty common and if anyone else has noticed other changes. 

Emotionally, by the gods has that been a massive change. It‚Äôs like I was colorblind and suddenly I can see all the shades I was missing. And I thought I was a very emotionally in tune person. The intensity I feel certain emotions has drastically changed too. Instead of becoming angry I go through a litany of smaller subsets of that emotion. Like instead of ‚ÄúI want to do something about this‚Äù kind of anger I instead am irritated, frustrated, or annoyed, and it feels completely different.
Sadness also has a larger swath of feeling to it, and I definitely feel some of that far more intensely than I used to.

I can definitely multitask a lot better than I used to. Not well, mind you, but better. The way I navigate while driving in new places has gone from mileage, street names and turns to landmarks, and time.

One of the biggest changes that I‚Äôve noticed is attraction. Both what I find attractive in people and how I feel that has fundamentally changed beyond just changes in libido and stuff. This goes for platonic relationships as well. How I feel friendship has definitely changed, though I don‚Äôt really have the words to describe in what way. 

I‚Äôve got a laundry list of little other things but I‚Äôll leave off here. Have a wonderful day you awesome people!!"	"This is so interesting, thanks for posting! :)
Yep, went through all that too ;)
I sort of thought like that before hrt. I'm curious what will happen a few months down the road for me. I was always pretty emotionally distant though. Getting weird having feelings for once.
Sorry I just realised how much a of a Mom comment this was! :D
Haha, no worries. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm not the only one that find this sort of thing fascinating
Definitely not the only one"	mvm4vp	trans	27	0.95	2021-04-21 18:32:08
The past week since I told my parents‚Ä¶	"So it‚Äôs officially been 1 week since my parents found out I wanted to be trans after randomly deciding they should search my phone.


Let‚Äôs just say they‚Äôre not too thrilled, my mom, (being as religious as she is) hates the idea and thinks that It‚Äôs an instability in my hormones and or I‚Äôm being influenced by the community itself.


My dad however is extremely confused as he‚Äôs, ‚Äúnever gotten a trans vibe from me‚Äù which is very wrong as I used to love watching stuff like Monster high on repeat as a kid, and to avoid being laughed at by friends and family I suppressed the idea of transitioning through all of middle school.


We sat down on the couch and wanted to explain to me why I wanted to be a woman, and I told her but of course it wasn‚Äôt enough which truly made her believe I was being influenced. It also shows I wasn‚Äôt ready to tell them as I still am having trouble finding the answers myself. After telling them stuff like ‚Äú I don‚Äôt like myself rn,‚Äù or not being able to see myself in the mirror really pushed them to the edge thinking I‚Äôm being influenced. Because, ‚Äú every trans person says those things.‚Äù 

They truly don‚Äôt think that I can think for myself‚Ä¶


What angers me most though is during our convo, said that I could never be a woman no matter how hard I tried, and those words hurt me the most through it all‚Ä¶


Fast forward to now, they have set up a therapy session for me,( for which I need to find out, as conversion therapy is not banned in my state‚Ä¶) and I am extremely scared, I‚Äôm afraid as I‚Äôve never done therapy before, but saying some NSFW stuff to explain why I want to be a woman. ( No I am not a gay guy.) 
Have limited my conversations to 3 people who don‚Äôt even talk to me before.  And all electronic devices such as computers and phones need to be out of the rooms and in living rooms.


That‚Äôs all for now, sorry for the long vent, just a lot going on, and with misunderstanding and unsupportive parents it‚Äôs really hard‚Ä¶
I am almost 16, and no I love them too much to run away or take shelter with someone else. I think the most they‚Äôll let me do rn is grow out my hair, but even that is a far fetched idea‚Ä¶

-Brianna"	"Hey Bri, I love getting under Christians skin, it's so thin usually and they are so easy.  Let me help you with the religious part of your parents argument.  You state that your mother is a devout Christian, so then she believes the God never makes mistakes since it is all seeing and all knowing, correct?  Then why would she question how God made you?  Unless she is saying that God made a mistake by making you trans, which would mean that her God is not all seeing and all knowing.  

Job 38.2 ""who is this that obscures my plans with words without knowledge?""  

If she thinks that you being trans is going against God's plan, ask her how she knows what God's plan for you is.  

Isaiah 55.8-9 God says ""for My thoughts are not your thoughts, nor are your ways My ways"", ""for as the heavens are higher than the earth, so My ways are higher than your ways and My thoughts are higher than your thoughts"".  

I'm pretty sure she is breaking at least one or more commandments with her attitude and assumption of knowing God's plans and thoughts.

My mom had some of the same misconceptions and didn't trust that I knew myself too (but I'm 33!) - I asked her to read through that site and it's taking time but I think she's getting better.
That‚Äôs exactly what I thought too, and I am planning on bringing that up to her either during the session or in a private matter as you‚Äôre not the first to state this.

All new to me and I just can't take it	"So I want to say I'm sorry in advance because I think this post is going to be very messy but I just can't get my thoughts in order and I also can't keep them inside anymore.

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

I'm a 19 y/o, AMAB, pre-everything trans girl, and my egg just broke between 2 and 4 days ago - it was like a stream of thoughts and actions that all happened in my mind and finally I connected all the dots - I am trans.

Now, while I've generally been doing bad - but okay - in life, in terms of general ""going on"" and being ""fine"" (but not really happy), today I literally crashed and felt like I was dying. Today was such a horrible day; I have literally never felt this bad before in my life - but it was also different than my other moments of sadness, anger or grief that I had in the past for any other reason.

Today I woke up as every other single day of my life, got my usual boy clothes on (I'm not out to anyone, barely myself), and got out to take the train to University for today's lessons. From the moment I left my home, I felt uncomfortable. Anxiety started growing slowly but constantly inside of me. I went to class, talked to some friends - but I was unable to concentrate or follow anything that the professor was explaining. I just kept thinking and thinking and feeling bad and panicking internally. Then after a morning full of bad uncomfortable feelings, I went to lunch with my friends but literally nothing changed - in fact, it kept getting worse. It got so bad that after lunch I told my friends I had to go home, and I did. I skipped all afternoon lessons. As soon as I left them, I went to the bathroom and had a breakdown. I put my headphones on, a song that is very special to me, and I started crying like a freaking fountain. Then I got myself together and got back on the train to hometown. After two hours of sadness and anger and panic, I finally got in my bedroom and broke down even worse than I did in the bathroom at Uni.

Then, after calming down a bit, I took my knee highs, skirt and boots, put them all on, and I finally felt peace of soul. I literally can't explain why or how. It's just clothes, nothing special; it's still me and it still looks like me. But I finally stopped feeling so terrible.

And the thing is that I just can't understand why I felt so terrible. I mean, I've always been slightly uncomfortable in my masculine body, but last week I didn't have any issue getting out of the door or following a lesson. Now I do. And yes, I just went through and realized a lot of stuff, but what I mean is - why can't I just *know* that I am trans, acknowledge that, but also keep going on in boy-mode as I always did?

The realization of my gender came only in the last few days and it was like a flash that opened my mind - but this is not something that I've only been considering for a few days. In fact, it's something that just kept coming to my mind periodically; maybe I did deep research and questioning for a week and then forgot for a month, but it's been going on for a few years now - and looking back, I can now explain and understand many weird behaviours or thoughts that I had when I was little.

I just wish I could get on with my life without being crippled like today - because it was so freaking painful and I'm so scared about tomorrow. I finally know what and who I am. I will try my best to follow the path to transition despite probably having to be 100% alone in it, without my family's support. But I also know that it takes time and I can't just wake up and look however I want. So since I know this, why, why can't I just keep going and why is it so sudden and so painful?

&#x200B;

Sorry for the very long post... and I hope you are all having great days!"	"It‚Äôs painful because your brain has been blocking it out for however long. I know for me I knew I was ftm by the age of 6-7 didn‚Äôt know it was actually a thing until I was 13-14 and started transitioning right away. But I lived my life as a male before my transition mainly except for times where my mom would try and have me wear girl clothes to school and I felt the same way constantly anxious and just overall wrong. Don‚Äôt down play how you feel right now it‚Äôs very important to do research and understanding your next steps to make you feel comfortable
Congratulations on coming out to yourself. I'm so proud of you!
Just gone through a similar thing myself, though i am in my mid 40‚Äôs. Never felt quite right, i perfectly attracted to women, am married etc etc.  always open minded that i maybe trans, but being later in life i feel i am just kidding myself that i could achieve ultimate happiness.

In a breakdown a few days ago i came out to my best friend who is cis female. I had no idea how she would react and i have everything to lose in life if she outed me.

Turns out she was super supportive, we haven‚Äôt had a big chat about it yet, but i sent her a small email to explain how i have felt throughout my life.

This helped, just by sharing it with one person took a massive weight off my mind, i am very lucky to have found a friend like this. It also helped me open my mind more.

All i can say is, if you have person you can trust, and i chose female friend as hopefully she can give me inside knowledge :-) , maybe that is a way you can make you feel better.
Hi beatrice. I'm sorry that your week has been so shitty. I get it, I really do. Dysphoria is a bitch. You are not a fraud and your feelings are legitimate. Fuck anyone who tells you otherwise. You are valid.
Personally I‚Äôm mtf but dress masc. I do wish I explored a bit more before jumping on hrt. Now I have breasts that I‚Äôd have to remove. It all seemed exciting to me but it took patience and self reflection in my case to really sort out my feelings outside of the excitement. I wish you luck in your journey!
I remember when I hit this point. I was in a perpetual state of panic for a couple weeks. I couldn‚Äôt focus at work and had zero appetite. Eventually I had enough and scheduled an appointment with a therapist. That was the first time I ever said the words ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans‚Äù to anyone and my god it was like the weight of the world was lifted off my shoulders. I started hrt 4 months ago to the day and have never felt better.
It's hard to keep going on in boy-mode as you always did because now you know that boy-mode is *wrong* for you. You recognize it for a lie the the whole world has spent your whole life forcing you to tell. You're recognizing that it is not a correct reflection of your identity, and that just rubs the wrong way against your soul. It's perfectly natural to have that reaction.

If you're in a situation where you can safely come out and start transitioning, maybe it's best for your mental health to just do that so you don't have to boymode anymore.

If you're in a situation where that's not safe, or for whatever other reasons you would be better off waiting for a while, then my only advice is to re-conceptualize what boymode *is* to you.

I'm not in a place where I can come out yet. I'll be stuck with boymode for another \~3 years. But I don't think about boymode as a reflection of who I am. It's not. Rather, boymode is a *disguise* that keeps me safe and keeps my life from turning to shit before I'm *ready* to come out. Before circumstances will change to where I can come out. I don't *like* it, but I recognize that it serves a very important (if temporary) function in my life. A function that supports my long-term goals.

If you don't have to keep boymoding, jeez, don't! Liberate yourself! But if you do, maybe finding a different meaning for it--as a tool you are using to help you reach your longer-term goals--will help.
Thank you so much for the kind words and for sharing your personal experience! You are completely right, I shouldn't neglect how I feel, and I won't - but I sure was hoping for a less violent wave of bad feelings.  
  
I just hope it gets better with time and acceptance... I just want to be happy and it's so cruel that we have to go through all of this just to achieve ""normality"".  
  
Anyways, thank you very much again and have a happy life! You're handsome!
Thank you so much ü•∫ it was so difficult to admit, and so overwhelming too... But it feels so nice to finally be acknowledged by someone, even if just online and very remote. You're the first person to say it explicitly and you made me very happy. Thank you!!
thank you so much for replying! I'm so glad that you're finally feeling better. I wish I could do like you and talk to a therapist, but unfortunately even though I'm 19 I still depend on my family financially (I'm studying at university) so I can't justify asking them that much money considering that I also can't come out to them.  
  
there's a bright side to it however - i couldn't find much info online, but it looks like since 2020 HRT is free for everyone in my country (but you need a prescription/certified dysphoria), so once therapy is done, I can probably continue my transition for much cheaper than other parts of the world. i just need to save enough money to be able to afford therapy now. and for the moment, I'll try my best to keep anxiety under control and concentrate on something else.

anyways, thank you again and I wish you a happy journey!
Wow, you really hit the spot - this is a perspective that didn't even cross my mind. Thank you so much for taking the time to reply, you are really helping me and I'm so grateful.  
  
You're right about everything - I probably suddenly feel this deep discomfort because I finally realized that I was lying to myself all the time and trying to fit - and now that I know I don't fit, it hurts to still have to carry this body around.  
  
I unfortunately can't come out publicly right now. I mean - I just started University and fortunately it looks like there are very supportive people, but I'm not close enough to them to say it yet, and I definitely can't tell anyone at home because that's probably the last time I'll see them, and besides loving them, I also need their financial support for my studies. I unfortunately recently lost the two people I thought I could trust the most, which were my girlfriend and best friend, who completely betrayed me and left me feeling like garbage. They are the only people I probably could've come out to as of now, but yeah.    
  
My idea has been to try and at least get dysphoria diagnosed, but I'll have to save quite a bit of money before I can. The good news however is that I'll be moving on my own apartment this summer, so I'll definitely gain much more independence.  
  
And I just can't thank you enough for the perspective you gave me of boymode. Like - it still hurts to even think that I'll have to put those clothes on and leave the house and literally hide my behaviour and personality from the people I have around. But thinking of it as a ""shell"", a tool to get me through these hard times definitely makes everything easier. I just have to disguise for as long as I'm not safe. Like hiding from an enemy, and this makes me invisible to them.    
  

Thank you again and I hope you can start showing the world your true magnificent self too as soon as possible. Have a great day!
Thank you very much stay strong üí™üèº
It is so difficult to understand, let alone even admit. I literally screamed out loud when I first realized. You're doing super good.
Dysphoria is not actually hard to self-diagnose, if you do it right.

Check out this [guide to gender questioning](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1S3IsEPXnC5CocTb1xkIA4mNaHi3hA2n5CDf6ENUCgTw/edit?usp=sharing). I gather you're past the questioning, but the path that the guide leads people through involves figuring out whether and how dysphoria is playing out in your life anyway.
Thank you one more time, that's a great guide! I only had time to look at some links from the first page, but I'll definitely look into it more in the next few days. From what I've read there, I've only got confirmation of what I was already thinking, which is nice.  
  
Thank you so much for helping me out! You are a blessing!"	tfnt9q	trans	26	0.94	2022-03-16 17:49:06
Help... I'm too scared to report him	"I'm really sorry for taking up everyone's time by posting this but I don't think I keep keep this anguish to myself anymore and need some guidance...

I'm a (MtF) trans, taking hormones for about 9 months now. About a month ago, I was raped by one of my closest friends who knew me before I started my transition and I'm so scared to do anything about it. 
It was the weekend before I turned eighteen, so a group of my friends took me out for dinner. Afterwards, we all split up and walked home and I was alone with **him**, when he asked if I wanted to stay at his house and call for a ride home. It started hailing really bad, and since his house was closer, I agreed.
When we got to his house, we were both soaking wet and freezing, so instead of calling my parents straight away, I took a few minutes to warm myself upstairs. I got ready to take out my phone, when he, completely naked, comes through the door, grabs my arm and throws my bag aside. I was so shocked that I didn't realize that he was pulling me into his bedroom until it was too late.
He ordered me to strip or he'll hurt me. I initially refused, thinking that this was just a really bad joke, until he punched and kicked me so hard I thought my bones would break. I took off everything except for my bra and undies, and he grabbed my arm again and pushed me onto the bed. Yelling at him, he forcibly removed the rest of my clothing despite my protests, and when I got fully undressed, I realized what a vulnerable position I let myself be in.
I begged him to just let me go, but he responded with things like *""You had this coming,""* and *""You should be happy you're getting laid at all.""* I asked him if he would really do this to a friend. He answered, *""You didn't have to be this girly.""* 
His grip on my arm was really hurting me at that point, and I just wanted to avoid angering him, so I stopped protesting, and what he did next is not something I can bring myself to tell in detail right now. It was incredibly painful, like I was getting crushed and ripped apart at the same time. I was both humiliated and in agony... so much that I wished to die right then, and right now I think I still wish for that.
He abused me for hours until he stopped and went to bed. I cried silently to myself until I could hear his snores. Too afraid to call anyone, I sneaked out early in the morning and ran home in the cold. My parents must have thought I was over at a friend's, so they didn't bother texting me. Afterwards, I kept everything that happened to myself. 
He later said he was sorry over a text, and wanted to continue being my friend if we could forget the whole thing. I told him to leave me alone, but he continues to message me about the incident, saying *""You didn't even hate it since you didn't pass out like real rape victims.""* I've been avoiding him ever since but I can only pretend it didn't happen for so long.

Sorry for that huge read but I'm so lost right now and I don't know what to do... I'll feel guilty if I'm responsible for throwing him in jail by pressing charges, and I don't want my other friends finding out that I got raped, or anyone knowing that I'm trans. I'm terrified of him and frightened that he might attack me again. I feel like he could pop out of anywhere behind me and drag me back to his home. I'm scared of revealing this to my boyfriend, because I don't want him to see me in such a pitiful state. I just don't know what to do anymore and I absolutely want nobody to find out about this... I'm afraid of posting here even on a new account in case anybody I know browses /r/trans but I feel like if I don't tell someone soon, I might just do the wrong thing and it can't be fixed. "	"As everyone else said yes you need to go to the police.  
  
Also in response to someone else saying they won't believe you. You said he text'd you about the rape so you do have proof of him saying that he did it.
You need to tell someone you know and trust. Your parents or your boyfriend. Someone who will believe you because unfortunately for rape victims there's always a chance of disbelief.

I'm sorry.
This is not your fault. Not even a little bit. The only person you should be concerned about right now is you.

Please report him. If for no other reason, so that this same thing doesn't happen again to you, or to another victim. Tell someone who you love and who loves you. They won't find you pitiful. They won't blame you for what happened, or for anything that happens to your ""friend."" You were the victim of an awful crime, something no one should have to go through. If you can't bring yourself to tell your loved ones, find a support group, find a therapist, talk to somebody. It will help. I'm so sorry. 

This was not your fault. There is nothing pitiful about you having gone through this. Pitiful is the creature that could do something like this to you. 
Tell your parents, please. You'll be protected by police and your parents. Please, he will only attack again and again.
*Please* go to the police! You should not feel guilty at all; he is the only one who has done anything wrong, and he should be punished for it. You really should tell someone you care about too, especially your boyfriend; you can't just keep this inside.

I'm so sorry for what happened to you.
You shouldn't feel guilty if he goes to jail; he really deserves to.
The ony reason I could see you having for feeling guilty about reporting him to the police is if you are still being nostalgic about your friendship with him.  Don't let that happen.  Despite however good friends you were before, he chose to do something horrible to you, and clearly showed his opinion of you.  This sounds like a hate crime, and if so he probably won't stop just because of your past friendship.  I'm sure this whole thing is very uncomfortable, but you can't think of him as your friend after what he did to you.
Please go to the police and report him. Do it for yourself and for the next victim. If you let him get away with this he will do it to someone else.
It may be a good idea to post in /r/RapeCounseling too...  a lot of people are in a similar situation, with worries about feeling alone and fears about reporting the situation.

Police. Now.
Go to the police. No excuses.
Listen to Castiel, please.
Unfortunately I don't think I have anyone I can trust right now... the only person I might be able to confide in is my boyfriend and I don't want him treating me differently because of this.

I will try to tell him... but I'm not sure if I can actually do it. 
Thank you for the advice, but my parents are still having a difficult time accepting who I am, I would feel terrible if I brought even more grief to them.
It doesn't matter. What matters is your wellbeing. This will fuck you up. Please report it. It will be better for everyone long term. You can get counseling and he gets put in jail where he can't hurt other women.
If they love you then they wont be grieved. "	19oxnc	trans	24	0.91	2013-03-05 05:54:20
I'm so f***ing sick of not knowing	"For the past few months I've been consistently flipping between ""I'm definitely trans"" and ""what the hell am I"" and I'm fucking sick of it!

It feels like something as big as what I identify as shouldn't be this difficult to figure out! Like, what the hell? It took me less than a full day to figure out other things about myself (sexuality, for example) so why is this taking me so long?

I'm comfortable identifying as a trans woman but as soon as I hear one reason I might not be trans my whole argument falls apart and I'm back to square fucking one!

It's to a point where I feel like the ends will never be able to justify the means, where the destination will never be worth the journey. Even if I do figure it out tomorrow the answer will be bitter sweet with all the pain, anger, and everything else that the questioning brought with it!

I'm at a point where killing myself feels like the better option, at least then it'll all be over and done with. Seriously, I'm just about ready to die with how fucking confusing, anger inducing, and painful this whole process has been!

I'm sorry for all the swearing, I'm just pissed off and at my wit's end with this whole situation, I just needed to rant about it and blow off some steam before I continue onwards, anyway, have a great day!"	"if it makes u feel better, i literally posted like ‚Äúi don‚Äôt know what the hell i am‚Äù three years ago and i‚Äôve been on hrt since a year after that. i always knew i was trans, but there‚Äôs something about proximity to real change that throws all rationality out the window. you might just need some time to settle before you go with one option or another

EDIT: ON THE SELF-HARM NOTE please don‚Äôt! this stuff is stressful and hard but it has a ending, and that‚Äôll come sooner than later. in the meantime, be patient with yourself. these are big questions, and it‚Äôs ok that you‚Äôre having trouble answering them quickly.

i‚Äôm here if you need to dm! but whether you do or not, i‚Äôll be in your corner, as will we all ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I don‚Äôt know if this‚Äôll help, but‚Ä¶ try to keep in mind the things that make you happy regardless of your gender. Whatever makes you happy is good. If thinking of yourself as a woman feels happy (or if the idea makes you nervous now, but you imagine it could make you feel happy someday), then cool. And if not, then that‚Äôs fine too. 

It could help to take a deep breath, step back, and look at the bigger picture‚Äîyour gender is not that important; your happiness is. If your gender/gender presentation is making you unhappy, then think about what would make you happy instead. 

I‚Äôm rooting for you, and I have faith that you will figure this out and be okay
dude i totally get what u mean - i identify as non-binary and i get super confused on the daily. it sucks ass 
please don‚Äôt kill your self - you might not be in a position where you are comfortable with yourself at the moment but that doesn‚Äôt mean you won‚Äôt be sometime in the future. you are important.
I want sure what to do at the start and spent ages trying to work it out, never getting anywhere. Eventually I couldn‚Äôt take it anymore so I started hrt anyway. I knew it was right the next day.
Really like the focus on happiness. Feel like its the real issue, at least it has been for me. I want to be happy with myself.
I can't start hrt. I'd love to, if for no other reason than for a bit of clarity but it's not an option for me at the moment
Even if you are trans, depending on your personality you might not be sure until after you've started HRT. 

The DSM-5 is the diagnostic criteria for gender dysphoria. See how it fits

Transgender reality	"Maybe I've spent too much time in transphobic online spaces recently, but I feel like I'm frequently seeing comments from people saying the trans community is encouraging people to transition, that when kids and teens start questioning their gender, they go online and find a ton of support from people who push them to transition.

And, seeing the accounts of people who have detransitioned, it seems like a lot of them admit that they got sucked into the 'idea' of being trans, that they had other issues going on but that the trans community just swept them in ('like a cult' some say) and convinced them they were trans and had to transition.

I personally disagree with these accounts, and here's why:

I think the transgender community is very supportive because living life before you realize you're trans is hard, realizing you're trans can be traumatic, and actually transitioning is really difficult, painful, expensive and takes friggin forever. This community has compassion for those dealing with this stuff, and I'm constantly seeing people in this community being open to questioning people and not ""pushing"" people to call themselves trans or telling them to transition.

But, if you're suffering from any number of life's difficulties, the open support of the trans community can be a welcome salve, and I can see how someone would want to assimilate into a community like ours to have that support and sense of belonging. Unfortunately, only you, yourself can tell you if you're trans, and only you will be able to tell if transitioning is really right for you or not. If you try to transition just to be part of this community, you will probably give yourself gender dysphoria and want to detransition. And if that happens, I'm very sorry and hope the best for you, and the trans community will still be here for you, as long as you don't turn into a victimized transphobe who calls the trans community 'a cult'.

**For anyone questioning their gender and browsing this sub: Here's the truth about being trans.**

I'm fortunate enough to be in a position to have health insurance, and a very supportive wife, and can afford most of the trans care my insurance won't cover. And I live in a trans supportive state in a somewhat accepting area. Relatively speaking, my transition has been, well, 'easy'.

Transitioning is really rough. I'm 49 years old, been on HRT 2 years and recently have had some gender affirming surgeries. I've struggled with undiagnosed gender dysphoria since I was a little kid and only realized what it was in my 40s, and the realization and subsequent transition have been the hardest, most difficult, most emotional things I have ever had to do in my entire life.

Being trans means having to deal with discrimination, with bigots, etc. Being trans means healthcare isn't as straightforward as it is for cis people, and can be downright aggravating and discriminatory. Being trans can be full of self-doubt, anxiety and depression. There's frustration and anger and exasperation. There's mind games with people who knew me before transition, will they be supportive, will they be weird about it? Sometimes I wonder if the gender dysphoria I experienced before transitioning was truly worse than the shit I deal with now.

But, its also been one of the best, most rewarding, most fulfilling things I've ever done. NOT because being trans so great, but because I had this MASSIVE HOLE IN MY LIFE, and transitioning completed it for me. And I realize I can look at myself in the mirror now and its me, not some stranger. That is better than any of the anti-trans bullshit that I have to deal with now.

If you are questioning your gender, that's fine and I 100% support it! But keep an open mind about your life, and make sure your reasons for transitioning are entirely yours, not someone else's."	Great post, thank you	10o04g7	trans	23	0.89	2023-01-29 05:39:46
The first time i feared for my life because I am trans	"My first ever post on this subreddit talked about how a run-in with a transphobe changed my views on wanting to transition and gave me the courage to start changing myself to feel more comfortable. I know what most people would say at this point, ' why would a traumatic event make you more determined?' Well, this event made me realize I shouldn't allow the actions of a few to stop me from being who I want to be. 

Now on to the story. I used to have this friend many years ago who I actively lost contact with because I found out he was a complete racist ( I won't go into details because it makes me feel uncomfortable but will if people ask me to). A couple of weeks ago this person ( I will call him R) knocked on my door and we caught up, in this conversation R mentioned that they had been getting their life back on the straight and narrow and I thought this meant that he had changed his views and had become not racist. I was wrong, he wasn't just racist he was also extremely homophobic and transphobic.

I found this out by him throwing out all the slurs in the book including the n-word, the r slur, the f slur, and the t slur. He also went into great detail on how he almost gauged out his brother's eye using his bare hands. At this point, I was feeling hella uncomfortable but I decided to see if things got better, bad choice. He went on to say how trans people aren't trans and how he would miss gender them and even go as far to beat them up.

At this point, I was scared for my own life and I began to shake, I picked up my phone and pretended my mum asked me to cook dinner as she was looking after my grandma ( ofc a lie). Being trans and having trans friends Rs' comment made me worry for my life as he has severe anger issues and I didn't want to be in the same house as him. 

I left and when I got home I hugged my mum, told her everything, went upstairs and curled into a ball on my bed and cried, I had never felt so alone and scared for something I am. I had to share my experience because I want to hopefully help people realize they are not alone in these experiences and that there is always support for you, luckily for me I had my mum and my most amazing partner who I could talk to, but I know all of you will have someone no matter how they are."	"Oh gosh I have a former friend like that and expect a similar encounter at some point. I got a cute little pocket pistol though so like try me.
I‚Äôm glad you got away without any issues though. He doesn‚Äôt know you‚Äôre trans or does hand and he was basically threatening you? Did he just bring up trans people on his own?
he doesnt know im trans, he was talking generally i hope. yeah he brought up everything by himself
I hate that. I‚Äôm not visibly trans, though some people can tell, and only out to a handful and maybe one in ever three social interactions I have ends up having someone bring up trans people. I live in a deep red state so it‚Äôs only ever people who know nothing about it but are sure they are experts talking about how 7 year olds are getting hormones and people just fully commit to transitioning on a whim. It‚Äôs super fucking annoying.

Do you plan on coming out publicly at any point? Do you think he‚Äôd go after you if you did or is he mostly out of your life?
Yeah Same I'm so early in transitioning most people just refer to me as aa man which kills me. I want to be public and I sortt of am, I want to be a role model for trans people."	tsvt5z	trans	24	0.97	2022-03-31 09:16:29
In a bad place.	"
I‚Äôm losing everything in my life right now and I don‚Äôt know if I can do this. My wife is divorcing me because she doesn‚Äôt want to be with a woman. 

There‚Äôs so much to it, we have 4 very young kids. I‚Äôve been with her since I was 20, now I‚Äôm 25. I‚Äôm so sad, I feel it in my body and I don‚Äôt know if I can do it. I‚Äôll be cleaning the house, watching my kids just be there, listening to the sound of everything going on. The kids laughing, my wife‚Äôs voice talking, the sounds of a family in a house. I think about how in six months I have to move out of this house. The house we moved into as a family and that I‚Äôll no longer hear that sound every day. And it breaks me. It makes me not want to exist. I feel it in my body, I feel it in my eyes, when I cry my tears feel hot on my skin. I made so many decisions and now I‚Äôm here, it‚Äôs all my fault. I felt as if I was going to take my life if I didn‚Äôt transition. I genuinely felt like a piece of me has been missing my entire life, and it‚Äôs still so confusing. And in the process of transitioning to save myself I‚Äôm losing another part of me I truly don‚Äôt think I can live without. I know it sounds dumb, that I shouldn‚Äôt be thinking this way, but my body can‚Äôt do it. I‚Äôm watching my life partner fade away before my eyes, I‚Äôm losing literal time with my children, and there are circumstances mixed into this that add an unbearable weight.

I‚Äôm scared. I don‚Äôt want to end up in a hospital alone as my life and the partner I was supposed to spend it with fades away. These emotions are so intense it makes me completely rethink transitioning, I‚Äôm in a crisis. I don‚Äôt know how to get through this. I can‚Äôt even put my life on pause to make it through it, I go to college full time because I get a housing allowance, I‚Äôm working a very stressful government job, I also have no real support. I am alone. I feel like I‚Äôve become nothing but sadness and anger, every piece of advice that the few people in my life give me I have a counterpoint to. I‚Äôll stop now though because I feel like I‚Äôm just complaining. I‚Äôm on here because it‚Äôs 4 am, I‚Äôm having a panic attack and I feel this sadness in my chest that makes me want to not exist. I am sorry for putting this on here, I have no where else to go."	"It doesn't really mean much but I hope you find the peace and love you deserve for and from yourself and others. I can't begin to imagine how hard things must be right now.
You have absolutely nothing to apologize for. Everything you're feeling is valid. People suck... emotions suck. When I was early in my transition I belonged to a transgender support group and I knew at least 2 trans women in situations like yours. They were absolutely wrecked by everything. Both of them are still around today. One of them managed to get a kind of partial custody of their children. One of them had their children stripped away until their children were old enough to make the decision to be around her on their own. 

I remember watching their statuses on Facebook and just trying to be a shoulder to cry on or someone to just be in their cheering section. Maybe you're here for a cheering section? For someone who's shoulder you can cry on? Someone who will understand what you're going through?
You have every right to be devastated by this. You didn't have a choice to be trans, and your wife doesn't have a choice in her sexuality. I can't imagine how hard it would be to be not only married, but to have 4 children as well, and then find yourself in a position to lose all of that. The only comfort I can offer you though is that at your age, I was early on in dating the person I would later marry, I hadn't figured out I was trans, I had a crap job, and ultimately didn't have much going for me. You have so much time to move forward and to foster an environment and a family that will support and love you for who you are. Right now you just need to weather the storm and look over the horizon, because eventually the clouds will break. You have a whole community behind you, and you have an open invite to talk to me any time for any reason. Stay strong üíôüíóü§çüíóüíô
Will your wife compromise at all? It wouldn‚Äôt be perfect, but nothing is ever perfect. If you could find a way that works for now, maybe you could ease into the huge change in your family rather that jump out of the house and the family. My ex and I did a ‚Äúnesting ‚Äú situation with the kids for a year before and another after our divorce. Kids stayed in the house, we were the ones who moved in and out of the house. It wasn‚Äôt ideal, as I had to find a roommate for an apartment, but it worked and wasn‚Äôt nearly so hard on the kids. My youngest was 6 years old at the time we ‚Äúnested.‚Äù
Thank you :) I‚Äôm trying to make it through this. I feel like I have no place to go and I don‚Äôt know what to do. But I‚Äôm trying
Yea definitely. I feel like I‚Äôm watching my life turn into a sad existence. I can‚Äôt even call the transllfeline right now, it‚Äôs never open anymore
I'm so sorry, hun. I know I don't have any kind of training in this regard or anything. But I see and hear you. And I know nothing is okay right now. The world feels like its falling apart and that tomorrow won't come. But it will. The sun will rise. The feelings will ease. The pain will still be there. The dread too, most likely. But you are someone worthy of love. Your identity as a woman is valid. And you shouldn't be robbed of your children because you decided to do something to take care of your mental well-being. As for your partner... I don't know much about them... but I know that sometimes it's just because they're straight. Sometimes it's because they hate. But the sun will rise. Good things will come again. You might even find that your kids are excited to see you as their mom some day. The new day is worth braving the storm for. You are so precious, you are loved, and you are worthy... even if it doesn't always feel like it."	10u8kf5	trans	20	0.93	2023-02-05 09:23:55
Disappointed with my brother.	"Waiting for my shift to start, I peruse news, Facebook and occasionally Reddit. On Facebook, my brother shared a clip from Pat Grey Unleashed, supposedly stating some liberal wants to cancel Fred Rogers, based on a clip from who knows how long ago, from Mr. Roger's Neighborhood. Basically saying men are always men and can't be women, and visa versa. In addition to mentioning firm gender roles.

It seems Pat Grey is a right winger, that wants to constantly play the victim card, with these kinds of clips. But, I and many of us understand context, that most of his viewers, won't even take the time to consider, just going with the libs are bad.

But, for my brother to share this clip, knowing I'm transitioning, really hurts me. I IMd him telling him the post hurt me, especially coming from him. He's the one member of my family that hadn't given me support, and I wasn't asking for it. Did I anger him, by replying to a previous Pat Grey post, about a man being thrown out of a mall, for wearing a Jesus Christ tee-shirt. He wasn't thrown out for the Jesus Christ on the front of his shirt, but the crossed out ""Coexist"" and hate speech on the back of his shirt.

I still have yet to hear back from my brother, if I ever, and I want to keep it between us. But, if his silence, speaks louder, or if he shares another transphobic post, I may have to make an issue of it with the rest of my family."	"Just because you share DNA with someone doesn't mean they deserve to be in your life.
Didn‚Äôt Mr. Rogers constantly make a point of not letting others tell you who to be? While I don‚Äôt know of him ever saying anything specifically about trans people, everything I have heard him say implies a belief in trans rights, even if indirect.
Not sure, as I'm Australian so ""Mister Rogers"" wasn't big here, but, I'm reasonably sure they issued a retraction or correction?
When I was young, my brothers and I were not allowed to physically fight.  That seemed to be the bright line my parents drew in the sand.  It was certain doom.  The other thing my parents did was yell at the first person who yelled.

Siblings are going to figure out how to do it anyway, right?

So the game was who could needle the other person until that person flipped their shit... and then that person was the one who had to go talk to mom or dad.  Didn't matter who started it or who was ""right"".

One time my brother was watching some horrible program on TV and I wanted him to change it.  So I sat there and said increasingly horrible things to him until he told me he hated me.  I responded ""I love you"" and he went bonkers.  Mom called him up and demanded to know what's going on... I got the TV.  She demands to know and he says ""\_\_\_ says they love me!"".  And then baffled silence.

Some of this I've taken to adulthood.  I am slow to show my feelings.  I learned with bullies that my best bet was often to deny them any response at all.  In arguments, sometimes nothing makes someone more mad if you don't even engage them; especially if you suspect they are trying to provoke you.

I don't know you.  I don't know your brother.  My experience may have no value what-so-ever.

Kill him with kindness... or at least don't entertain provocation.  You don't need his approval.
here‚Äôs my thing, siblings argue. Obviously have different political views. If you let THIS ruin your relationship with your BROTHER, you‚Äôve got a deeper issue than he doesüòÇjust for sharing that stuff
I'm your brother is letting you down like that, whether through ignorance or Malice it's still hurtful and clearly biased thinking towards a certain viewpoint that champions a false narrative of ""political correctness gone mad"". I hope he isn't brainwashed by them and comes round so that you can have a relationship of compassion and understanding going forward.

I was actually just watching a video about how cancel culture is obviously made up rhetoric before I opened reddit and saw your post. I have a father who believes that conservative rubbish too easily and says terrible things. I try to collect videos that challenge and prove his thinking wrong while educating myself and reminding myself of how narrow his worldview is. One day I'll have the guts to send them all to him lol.

Take care. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Blood doesn't mean family.
As I stated before, in a different way, when one of them says the quiet part, out loud, and we call them out on it. They will pore over everything we said, to look for the nugget that makes us look just as bad, when taken out of context. And completely ignores the context.
The episode that they pulled the clip from was from the 70's. The show has been off public television for more than a couple decades. So, there wouldn't be any retraction. And for someone to pore over 50 year old episodes of a children's show, looking for a gotcha statement to be taken out of context, is a bit sick.

No, my brother just shared it, so he's not the sick one.
If I remember correctly, Mr. Rogers, at some point did correct it
Transphobia = siblings arguing?
Someone denigrating who you are isn‚Äôt an argument over politics. Why are you on trans boards?
There‚Äôs quite a difference between siblings arguing and a sibling sharing transphobic rhetoric and being hateful simply because of your gender identity.
Begone troll. Don't need any of that here.
I understand completely. I was the big brother, and he had a bit of hero worship with me. I had brought gaming home with me from college. We both straddle 60, and both his daughters support my transition, but we've grown more distant, especially since our mother passed, with my wife shortly after, a few years ago.

I just want an acknowledgement from him, that what he posted was insensitive, and that he respect me as a brother would. I'm not asking him to support my transition, just not throw his transphobia in my direction.
Sharing it implies agreement, no? These people want us to ""go away"" and they don't really care how that happens. Your brother is, by sharing this transphobia, implying that he would absolutely stand aside as you are dragged off to a camp for being a deviant.
Not sure about that. He's been dead for 20 years
yes sibling arguing in this situation
Girl, this guy is a transphobic dipshit, this isn't just a sibling argument. You don't need to keep anyone in your life who doesn't respect you.
But, I'm giving him the chance to acknowledge what he did. If he posted it out of ignorance, that's one thing. If it was malicious, well, that's another thing, enough to make me reconsider our relationship.
Yeah, the show was ages ago, so I might be misremembering. The man did have multiple statements in regards to ""just be yourself. it's the best,"" but unfortunately, he was around well before trans issues got much spotlight. From what we've seen of him, though, I'm pretty confident that if he was still around, he would be supportive.
Well, you know your brother obviously. Only you can decide if he's willing to accept you as his sister and as a human or if he's ultimately going to descend into violent transphobia. I wish you the best luck in this.
Well the guy was bisexuality I know that. He didn't try to hide it."	10g2wdu	trans	21	0.88	2023-01-19 14:21:09
so, it happened. i came out to my mom as trans. and, i don‚Äôt really know how to feel right now. (warning: this is long!)	"Hi, I‚Äôm Ana. I‚Äôm a 19-year-old trans girl and I‚Äôve been on HRT for about 3 months now.

I‚Äôve been wanting to come out to my mom as a trans girl for a while. She‚Äôs probably the person I am closest to in life, but there are still walls between us that prevent us from really being as connected as I wish we were.

For instance, she‚Äôs very conservative, and has a very narrow mindset about people. She‚Äôs generally a very kind and caring person, though, and her traditionalist beliefs are more a product of how she was raised than anything (she grew up in a deeply catholic household and was emotionally abused by her parents because they wanted to mold her into this perfect image of traditional, religious, conservative womanhood.)

Anyway, even though our beliefs often get in the way (I‚Äôm a leftist commie into witchcraft and she‚Äôs a conservative capitalist into Jesus), I still trust her with my life, because she‚Äôs always been there for me.

(I know that was a long introduction, this will probably be a long post in general so be warned.)

In recent weeks at therapy, my counselor has been encouraging me to start coming out to people, or at least start being a little more authentic in how I present myself to people. To me, the first person who comes to mind is my mom, because we are so close. I don‚Äôt really have many friends nor significant others, so that was out of the question. She was the obvious choice.

I never thought to come out to her before, for the same reason why it took so long for me to come out to MYSELF‚Äîa religious upbringing and my family‚Äôs conservative views. When I was younger the only time my parents mentioned LGBT people was in ridicule or disgust, so I felt ashamed and frightened.

However, now that I‚Äôm 3 months on HRT, i feel a lot more confident in my identity and like this is as good a time as any to come out to her.

It felt like a 50/50 in terms of whether she would be accepting, but I had this feeling that no matter what happened, things would work out. I don‚Äôt know, just optimistic I guess.

Last weekend I wrote up a message I would give to her‚Äîmaybe slip it under her door or something. What I decided on, was that yesterday, I handed her the piece of paper before I went to therapy.

Basically, I told her to read it while I was gone, and when I came back, we could talk about it. Seemed like a better idea to me than just going ‚ÄúSURPRISE, I‚ÄôM TRANS‚Äù and expecting her to have an immediate reaction. 

That whole session I was scared out of my wits because I was so nervous as to what response I would get when I arrived home. Of course my counselor talked me through my fears and assured me things would be all right.

When I got home, I knocked on her door and asked to come in. It was silent. I knocked again and waited there for a little while. I knew she was there, she just didn‚Äôt want to open the door.

Well, it wasn‚Äôt locked, so I quietly opened the door and walked in. She wasn‚Äôt in her chair or on her bed like usual. I turned a corner and saw she was sitting on the floor by the closet door, looking at old baby pictures. She didn‚Äôt speak for a while, but I knew she sensed I was there.

Finally, she said, ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt know how I didn‚Äôt know.‚Äù I tried to explain to her how it took ME a long time to figure it out and it‚Äôs not her fault for not knowing earlier, but at this point, she was very upset.

She asked me the emotional questions, the ‚Äúwhat‚Äôs going to happen to my son,‚Äù ‚Äúwhy would you want to destroy your body,‚Äù ‚Äúhave you been lying to me all these years.‚Äù

Then there was the hysterical remarks. ‚ÄúI must have failed as a mother.‚Äù ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt even know who you are anymore.‚Äù ‚ÄúMaybe youre just confused.‚Äù ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre not anything like those people.‚Äù Blah blah blah.

We went back and forth for a while, my mom bombarding me with all her panic and fear and anger. I knew she would have questions but it felt more like a barrage.

I tried answering all her questions, explaining myself as best I could. I tried easing her worries, though I knew she was beyond help. I tried so damn hard to get through to her, but she wasn‚Äôt really listening.

So, I decided the best thing to do was to back away and tell he to sleep on it. We could talk again in the morning when she wasn‚Äôt so upset.

I cried myself to sleep, releasing all that tension. I wanted to just burst into tears and scream at her but I knew I needed to keep my dignity and stay strong while I was talking to her.

In the morning, she was at the table drinking coffee. I walked over and sat down next to her. I needed to wait for her to talk first.

She looked up at me and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm sorry about yesterday. I may not like it, or agree with it, but I‚Äôm always going to accept you. Your life is going to be very hard but I support you.‚Äù

I gave her a hug and thanked her, even though in my heart, hearing her say those things hurt. Being trans isn‚Äôt something to agree or disagree on, it‚Äôs who I am.

But, at least this is a start. This is going to be a long process, but I know that one day things will work out. I just hope that one day she will no longer see me as the son she lost, but the daughter who‚Äôs been there all along.

Now my only problem is that she wants me to come out to the rest of my immediate family as soon as possible because she ‚Äúdoesn‚Äôt like keeping secrets.‚Äù Which, I don‚Äôt feel super comfortable with yet, because that‚Äôs gonna be an even harder battle to fight. We‚Äôll see what happens, though.

Hello, my name is Sara and I am a transgender woman from Spain.  I just wanted to give you a lot of encouragement and send you a lot of strength.  You are doing the most honest and courageous.  I know it is very hard, but believe me it is the best you can do.  I am 43 years old and have recently come out of the closet.  My partner did not accept who I am and my marriage broke up and with it part of my life project.  I wish I had been as brave and smart as you.  You have all my respect and I just want to wish you the best and the greatest happiness in your life.  Do not be overwhelmed and think that in the end, this period of ""revelations"" will end and you can be yourself.  Your life belongs solely and exclusively to you.  Be always happy.  A hug full of affection.  Never give up.
Thank you!!! I was absolutely terrified and thought that I could fall apart at any minute but I knew I needed to keep a level head to show how serious I was about it. Hugs ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

I feel so hopeless, powerless, depressed, and angry, and it‚Äôs all Greg Abbott‚Äôs fault	If it wasn‚Äôt for him I would‚Äôve gotten puberty blockers and transitioned when I was ready but because of him no doctors called us back and I just went back into the closet. There‚Äôs no point in transitioning right now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôll be a little over 2 years before I can get hormones when I‚Äôm 18. If I transition right now I might pass for a while but I‚Äôm just going to slowly look manlier. I‚Äôm lucky to look and sound like I do up to this point (even if I still hate it) but it‚Äôs not likely I‚Äôll stay like this until I turn 18. It‚Äôs just so anger inducing and depressing knowing I‚Äôm powerless to do anything. The only thing stopping me from transitioning before was myself being too nervous to come out but now it doesn‚Äôt matter anyway.	"I'm so sorry.

A Good Husband, Father, Mentor, Boss, Friend, and Ally Was Killed Yesterday	"Today, while bicycling into work, my boss, who was also my mentor, an ally, and a great friend, was killed when a truck hit him on his bicycle.

He was also a husband and a father of two daughters.

He served his country honorably for 28 years in the US Army.

He was genuinely a good person.

The world is slightly darker place because of this.

We'll miss you, my friend, we will all miss you.

Why is this relevant to this sub? Because I had just come out to him (my boss) as transgender on Monday, and the first words out of his mouth after I told him were 'what can he do to make this transition easier on me?'

Why am I posting this here? Mostly so I can unload my sadness and anger. But also to let other transgender people know that there are good people in this world who are very accepting, even despite what their background might indicate.

*It was purely an accident, the driver was not at fault, both legally, and based on what I know, as someone who rides that route regularly, not at fault for real, either. Be safe out there, everyone."	"OH MY GOD! My condolences to you all!
Many times parents are different to their children than they are in the workplace.  If you get the chance in the coming days and weeks, please let His daughters know you found Him compassionate and caring.  Many workplace standards are simply not to harass or discriminate.  His reaction was to solicit advice on making things easier on you and that says a great deal about who He was.  Someone His daughters may not have had a chance to meet depending on age.  

Thank you for making it clear there was probably no negligence or foul play involved.  Life is uncertain and things happen.  Thank you also for being strong and relating this experience through everything that is happening.
I'm so sorry that this has happened, my heart goes out to his family, and to you for losing an ally, mentor and friend, reading your post made my eyes tear up, 

All those who ride bikes of any kind please stay safe on your journeys.
> Someone His daughters may not have had a chance to meet depending on age.

Trust me, they know. His family have talked about how supportive he was, for everything

Coming out	Made this account just for this post. My parents have always supported me in everything always told me if I turned out gay they would still love me but when they found the women clothes they dam near kicked me out of the house and now I'm terrified because I'm not only bisexual but now I'm realizing I'm trans as well and I know if they find out I'm dead for sure because my dad...well he has anger issues I'll say....just needed to get this off my chest thank you for reading if you read this far	"Do you have someone you can stay with to be safe?
Good luck
Hi sweety!
I'm sad to read that your parents reacted that way. I hope you stay safe and if it gets worse, do get help.
We here on Reddit will always be here to listen and support you.
Lot so love.
if you dont feel safe you need to move out asap or maybe try staying at a friends house

Can‚Äôt tell if my mom is starting to adopt transphobic beliefs (update)	It got pretty much validated today I think she is. She started talking about how if i go on hormones I won‚Äôt be able to have children (If I remember correctly if i fully transition i won‚Äôt be able to but if i detransition a little I will be able to), I will become a lifetime customer of the pharmaceutical industry (not sure why this is a problem), and she blamed my gender dysphoria on me having mental issues like depression, father issues, etc. She made me nearly cry after she invalidated my dysphoria called it ‚Äúother things‚Äù for a while and offended me beyond belief, all I could do was push her and she said ‚Äúthat was very masculine of you‚Äù, I got unbelievably hurt and angered by this so much that I pushed her more and even harder. After that i can‚Äôt remember much but she denied being transphobic and I yelled at her saying that she has failed as a mother because of her reaction to me being trans and then she ran off crying after saying ‚Äúshe knows she failed as mother‚Äù, among some other stuff, she has mental issues as well (she was suicidal when she was younger, depression, etc), I couldn‚Äôt bring myself to want to help her stop crying because all i can do is sit in my room and nearly about how all her protrans stuff was her lying in my face I can‚Äôt even talk to her. I‚Äôve had problems crying my whole life. (Edit) she told me she doesn‚Äôt think I‚Äôm trans to my face, and she would never let me get HRT. Hopefully my therapist can sway her away from this but I don‚Äôt know what to think anymore or do. She said not being able to cry isn‚Äôt a feminine trait she doesn‚Äôt even know how dysphoric I get about not being able to cry most of the time. I always had suspicions but the game was rigged from the start	"Science is getting wacky, sooner or later trans people will be able to have kids.
That's a trashy situation to be in, fam. Your reaction is absolutely justified, your mother has just tried to dismantle your identity, to your face no less. Her personal issues have nothing to do with it. You can be mentally ill but not an asshat. I wish I could offer some supportive words, but I really don't know what to say. Don't let her gaslight you, don't let anyone tell you who you are and who you are not. Things will get better, if you want someone to talk to, feel free to DM me.  People like her don't deserve to have you in their lives. You're worth more than that. Please, please take care of yourself.
I‚Äôm really sorry about all of this.  I hope she can turn things around, for your sake and for the sake of your relationship.

If you trust your therapist, definitely do a session together and have your mom do some alone with your same therapist.

I came out at 13 (11 years ago) and my parents both went to therapy with my therapist and it helped them a lot.  Also going to a support group and meeting more  trans kids and their parents.  That might be out of reach because of covid/geography but I recommend looking into it."	n9nwuf	trans	19	0.93	2021-05-11 03:34:51
Lets talk about being a man stuck in a man's body	"Hi! I'm a 30 something trans woman and I'd like to talk about being a man. Because even though a lot of people want me to identify as one, its tough when I've personally identified as female for so long, not that anyone knew that until I came out a few years ago.

&#x200B;

But first, let me say this: I have been a VERY lucky transitioner. My friends and family are loving and supportive. My work is professional and accommodating. And perhaps most relevant to this conversation, I get absolutely no push back from anyone for presenting myself as I do. There are many who'd say I'm fooling myself, especially trans detractors, but as much as my insecurity would love it, I've never been mispronouned or stared at, and nurses regularly remind me that I'm still due for that pap smear.

&#x200B;

Like I said: I've been very lucky.

&#x200B;

But lets take the almost universally positive experience that's been my transition and turn it on its head: let's take the trans exclusionary radical feminists at their word for a moment and see where that leads us.

&#x200B;

So I'm a man.

&#x200B;

But unlike most men, I'm a man who burned off his facial hair and then took female hormones to reshape his face and body so that he would outwardly match the appearance of a woman. I've also trained my voice so that I can sound like a real woman, but essentially, my natural voice and biology are 100% male. A father, not a mother, a boyfriend, not a girlfriend.

&#x200B;

He, him, his.

&#x200B;

Which means that my transition was a mistake. Whoops. No more hormones, no more voice nonsense, no more calling myself a woman. Presumably, I should also correct people who get my male pronouns wrong... after all, I'm pretty sure anti-trans folks don't want me to stop behaving and dressing the way that I'm most comfortable, which will undoubtedly lead to some misgendering. I mean... I like long hair and dresses, and I behave the way I behave. You can't fault me for that.

&#x200B;

So what does this more truthful life look like? I'm sure that seems besides the point to its proponents, but seeing as how I'm fundamentally altering my life to fit your premise, at least give me a moment to talk about what my life is like now as a very feminine man. Doesn't seem like that much to ask.

&#x200B;

Well, most of the time, its just really uncomfortable.

Really, really, uncomfortable.

&#x200B;

And scary.

Very, very scary.

&#x200B;

Putting aside how I feel about my body for a bit, people are either polite and treat me like an outrageously flamboyant man, or they're not polite and they treat me like a perverted man wearing his sexual fetish around in public. Which is odd... because I haven't changed my daily behavior or my routine in the morning. I'm still generally sweet and friendly to everyone I meet. I wear the same neutral shade of blush and keep my hair in the same thick, shoulder length waves. Why should being a man change that? It's honestly a pretty conservative look.

&#x200B;

And yet, no more friendly smiles and casual chats with moms when I pick up my daughter from kindergarten. No more kind banter with the older gentleman at the local coffee shop, no genuine warmth when I tell the barista I like her hair. Faces fall when I'm introduced as dad to the parents of my daughter's new friend. Even the kindest people fall silent and awkward when I assure them that, yes, I'm just a regular guy, so please don't call me ""her"".

&#x200B;

Awkwardness. Tension. Staring. Thinly veiled hostility as I refresh my nude lipstick in the men's room before using the urinal.

&#x200B;

But, of course, we know why. Those who meet me have no idea what to do with me, the social cues are all missing and in their place is discomfort or anger. Filtered through the prism of what they think a man is, I become so skewed as to no longer be visible, comprehensible. I am just a mystery. A threat. An anomaly flying hard into the face of gender roles so deeply rooted in our psyche that psychologists say we imprint on them as young children. It's an association so strong that people kill themselves when that gender imprint and their external biology don't line up.

&#x200B;

But maybe I'm one of the lucky ones. Maybe I can deal with the hair, the genitals... this man's body. This is the cost of living my life truthfully. And besides, as any radical feminist knows, this terrible miscommunication and discomfort is really all on our society and its deeply seated issues with gender. I'm doing everything I can for now and this torturous, dangerous, strained existence is worth it because, decades from now, maybe people will finally stop falsely conflating being biologically male with masculinity.

&#x200B;

That's what you want, right? For me to face this reality?

No, not want... *demand*.

&#x200B;

So how about not. How about I choose how I want to accommodate this intellectually lazy, xenophobic, heavily gendered culture of ours. Because I do have to accommodate it, and that means choosing between being seen for my chromosomes or being seen for myself. And I choose to be seen for myself. My personality. My thoughts and my fucking feelings.

&#x200B;

If society can only comprehend me as I am if I present myself as a woman, then I will be a woman. I refuse to let anyone else's interpretation of my biology get in the way of being seen and being heard.

&#x200B;

...does that last bit resonate, trans exclusionary radical feminists? Does it sound familiar?

&#x200B;

Ah, well.

&#x200B;"	"Technically speaking biology is on your side in this since studies have found that trans women have brains more like that of a female when compared to the average male brain.

A good conversation	"So, I (22ftm) came out to my 17m cishet cousin yesterday, and it was easy.  Too easy.  There was something he wanted to say that he couldn't seem to get out.   Well, today it came.  He can't understand what I'm going through and thinks I'm just going to be making my life worse for myself.  That I am giving up and running away from my problems with my body by changing it, rather than fighting to accept it as it is.  And I think I utterly failed to get him to understand.

  But, ya know what?  I can't stop smiling.  That conversation probably would've wrecked me (and many other newly-discovered trans people) if I weren't confident that I'm actually a man.  It would've broken my heart, and I would be hiding again.  I would've felt attacked, and unloved and invalidated as a person.  It would've been a huge setback, and it wouldn't be the first time he's torn me down like that (not for lgbt issues, other stuff, it's rare, but when we really fight, it gets nasty), so I'm a bit more vulnerable to him than I am to some others.

  But it wasn't.

  For the first time in my life, I stood up for myself, and not even from a place of hurt, or anger.  His words couldn't touch me, but I wanted him to understand.  The last thing I said was ""This isn't really about other people.  This is about me, and how I see myself.  Like, if I were the only person in the world, who would I want to be and how would I present myself?  I would be a man, and that's probably the best way I can explain why I'm doing this.""  He didn't say anything after that, but that's just because we're both awkward, so it didn't matter.

  I want to feel like this forever.  I'm more confident, self-assured and happy than I have /ever/ been, and this is the greatest accomplishment in my life so far.  If this is who A. Dylan is, then my life will be amazing, and I can't wait to live it every day."	"That‚Äôs wonderful to hear!!! Congrats!  There‚Äôs a special feeling when you‚Äôre finally in control of your life and no longer controlled by other‚Äôs expectations.  You‚Äôre finally living your life for yourself!  When I finally got to that point the song Numb by Linkin Park really resonated with me and became my theme song.
I know, right? I'm feeling the same way right now. You spend your whole life telling yourself that your loved ones are right and you're broken, and then you accept who know you are deep down and suddenly their opinions just don't matter. Love them, hate them, respect them, doesn't matter. For once in your life, you know that they're wrong and you finally feel in control of your thoughts.
I've never experienced this feeling, this confidence, before.  I've always been very timid and vulnerable to perceived criticism.  It truly is a special feeling to be free of that.  I get what my therapist meant about depression reducing as you start to transition now, and I haven't even started hrt yet!  Monday is the day, it's soooo close!  Sleeping tonight is gonna be impossible, this empowerment is intoxicating and I am flying high!
Yeah, it took me a long time to get here, especially due to masking making me confused about ny identity as an individual (an autistic trait).  He was wrong, and I knew it, but it does help when you know it comes from a place of ignorance, rather than hatred.  I'm very lucky to have the family that I do.  I know that they won't abandon me because of this (or anything else), and I know they aren't saying shit behind my back (if they have shit to say, they say it to your face, it's refreshing).   It's easier to be confident when you know you won't lose everything, but I was always nervous anyways.  Scared that their tolerance of my quirks would run out some day, and I would be left behind.  I had the confidence and trust that they would not do that this week, and now I feel more connected to them than ever.  My anxieties and abandonment issues were holding our relationships back for years, and it's like all those fears have dissipated for the first time in my life.  They might not understand, but they love me, and knowing that is what gives me control.
That‚Äôs because you know it‚Äôs right, all the way to your core‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs how it should be. I‚Äôm so happy for you!"	vadpa7	trans	20	0.95	2022-06-12 03:53:59
I really need to get this off my chest	"I'm an 18 year old college freshman, and I've recently realized that I'm a trans woman. This realization has caused many repressed memories to resurface and has had me change my whole outlook on my childhood, so I really need to get all of this off my chest.

For some context, I am biracial with my mom being white and my dad being black. My dad was a 6'9 basketball player, and my mom was a 5'4 cheerleader. My dad is extremely masculine, and he ended up pushing all the stereotypical values on me. The fact that I'm named after him and I'm his only son certainly didn't help. He has a job where he has to travel a lot, and this made it so that left me with my mom and my younger sister for about half the time while we were growing up. This and a few childhood events would put a wedge between me and my dad that has only widened over the years. 

When 5 years old, my parents and I had first moved into the house I would end up spending the rest of my childhood in. I was playing in the yard with my dad, and I saw some pretty wildflowers growing on the side of the house. I picked one and gave it to my dad to show that I loved him. He immediately threw the flower on the ground and yelled at me saying that flowers are for girls and that I shouldn't like flowers. I didn't understand why he was so upset at me. I just wanted to do something nice for him. I just knew that ""acting like a girl"" made my dad upset at me, so I believed that I shouldn't act like a girl and that it was wrong for me do so. I never knew it at the time, but this was the root of the repression of my feelings. 

I went on to play sports not because I wanted to, but because I felt like I was supposed to. I liked the comradery aspect to it, but I hated the games. I would basically have a panic attack due to my fear of disappointing everybody, especially my dad. During my 1st season of baseball I was too scared to swing the bat when I played. I would just stand there until I struck out, and my dad became sick of it. He told me that I needed to swing the next time I went up, but I was still too scared. I struck out again, and he walked to the fence where I was playing outfield and just glared at me with the most anger I had ever seen in somebody's eyes. That look and the yelling after left a deep scar on me, so the anxiety I would get while playing basically ruined my ability to enjoy playing sports, and because ""boys don't have emotions"", I was never able to open up about it until after I had already quit sports for years. 

Being a boy was all I knew, and I wouldn't even fathom the concept of trans people until years later. This would cause me to suppress my curiosity with being a girl and later my memories of even having those feelings. 

I developed depression in 6th grade and I became suicidal in 7th. This was when I first started feeling different from other boys. I knew that I didn't want to be like them, but I didn't know exactly why. I had friends, but they were all other boys. At least from my experience, male social groups are extremely unfulfilling. Men are supposed to bottle up their emotions and be dominant, so you can't show affection or vulnerability. All of this left me feeling like a zombie just going through the motions of life. I thought about killing myself everyday from 7th grade through quarantine. I got good grades and looked happy on the surface, but I hated my life. I was also overweight, and felt really guilty about it. I subconsciously suppressed my apatite to the point that now I don't have one anymore. 

I felt so much guilt. I couldn't think of a reason why I was so unhappy, so I just assumed I was being ungrateful. I hated myself for that. I hated myself so much, and I think I still do deep down at least just a little bit. I internalized so much self hatred during this time that it has left a permanent scar on my mind that I don't know will ever fully heal. I'm at least self-aware of it now, so at least that's something.  

This went on for most of high school. I started seeing a therapist witch helped a little bit, but I didn't really know how to open up at the time. During this time I started experimenting with drugs out of boredom and ended up having a bad experience during my 1st time trying Adderall that scarred me away from doing anything crazier than smoking weed. I also learned that it was possible for me to be attracted to guys when I developed a crush on my friend. He didn't reciprocate my feelings, but I didn't really expect him to. It didn't really disappoint me. lastly, I tried 3 types of antidepressants that all did nothing for me. All of this led me to being helplessly unprepared emotionally for the pandemic.

The pandemic was horrific for my mental health, and I was left with no coping mechanisms left but stealing my dad's vodka and getting wasted almost every night. During one of these nights I felt the strange urge to get up and dance. When I did I felt light on my feet and free. I felt feminine. The next morning I thought it was odd, but I deliberately choose not to think about it. I also attempted to end my life during this time, but I'm very grateful that I was unsuccessful.

I had been aware of trans people for 3 years at that point had always been very supportive of their struggles, but I had never fully considered if I was one. After hours and hours of thinking I came to the conclusion that I would rather live as a woman, but I figured that since I'm 6'0 there was no point in transitioning because I would never pass. I ended up suppressing those feelings and I decided to try and live as a man as best I could. 

After quarantine ended, I got my drivers license, and I was able to be at least somewhat independent. I ended up meeting this girl who has this infectious energy to her and we slowly became best friends. She was so free-spirited and confident in herself despite all the trauma she's been through. She's also a proud lesbian, and her  We would tell each other everything, and she was the 1st real friend I've had where I can actually be vulnerable with. After we cut off some toxic friends we both had, we had we became inseparable, and I wanted to spend every moment of everyday with her. I was falling in love. She loved me too, and it was actually the 1st close friendship either of us had ever had. She eventually asked to hook up with me, witch made me extremely happy. I thought it was strange that she would want to because she's a lesbian, but maybe she knew something I didn't. We did a couple times and the emotional connection was there, but it felt like something was wrong. I knew why it felt wrong deep down, but I still didn't want to accept it.

Now we finally get to present day. I've been trying to adjust to living out of state, hours away from home, where I also don't know a soul. The emotional whiplash of always having a really close friend to talk to to having nobody has been really hard and has led me to look back on my life. I now realize that I've been trans the whole time, but my own doubt and fear made me forget. I now realize that being tall doesn't mean that I can't pass. I now realize that it's possible for me to be happy. 

I now plan on starting my transition as soon as possible. 

Sorry this post was so long."	"My heart was not ready.
I am so sorry all of this happened to you and very glad that you see a better future for you now. 

I have got a small child and the thought of doing this flower thing your dad did to any child, no matter which gender, is terrible. Giving a flower to show your affection is such a nice thing to do. That is maybe not the saddest thing about your story, but the one that sticks with me the most.

How do I deal with a close friend who is supportive but unintentionally says things that make me feel dysphoric?	One of my best friends, who is generally very supportive of my transition, sent me a message about being envious of me not getting a period as a trans woman. She said that I ‚Äúget to be a beautiful lady without having to deal with a monthly week-long bout of pain and anger blood. Not fair dude.‚Äù I‚Äôm pretty upset about it but I‚Äôm not sure if I‚Äôm overreacting. Even so, how should I talk to her about it? It‚Äôs not the first time she‚Äôs said something similar to this. Thanks friends <3	"You should talk to her and explain how you feel about it. Maybe she has no clue.
Sounds a lot like they maybe reflecting a lot of their own anger on you. You have to deal with your own girl problems that they aren't going to understand and some communication about that may help.
‚ÄúYo, friend, buddy, pal, chum. These things you‚Äôre saying, you don‚Äôt realize this but it hurts me in a way you‚Äôll never understand and I need you to know this‚Ä¶your support isn‚Äôt as supportive as it can be.‚Äù

What cis women don‚Äôt understand is that for some trans women‚Ä¶like myself‚Ä¶the lack of a period is heart breaking. I want to be thee mom not a mom. I want to get pregnant like a cis woman gets pregnant and because I lack the period women hate to have‚Ä¶I lack the ability to grow and birth children. It is something I will never get to experience the way a cis woman can. It‚Äôs not a joyous thing not having a period. And the thing is, I want to hate having a period too. I want to agonize with my sisters about how awful they are and complain about the cramps and my monthly aunt flow being a bitch to deal with every month but I can‚Äôt. And that makes me feel less than and I can‚Äôt use words well enough to express the sheer amount of sorrow I feel because of this‚Ä¶

The only camaraderie I have is with other barren women and that isn‚Äôt the camaraderie I want to have going on every time a cis woman tells me they‚Äôre so jealous I don‚Äôt have a period or that I shouldn‚Äôt want it because it‚Äôs awful. Fuck I get that and I still want a womb that hurts me because it‚Äôll hurt less than than it hurts my soul not having one.
I would kill to have a functioning female reproductive system and I'd absolutely take the pain that comes with that.

She probably doesn't mean anything negative by it. It's easy to take something for granted and not realize how much it might mean to someone else to have that thing. 

Like people with attentive parents might say how lucky a kid with neglectful parents is for not having a curfew but don't really see all the things attached that the other kid would dearly love to have.

I'd just have a conversation with her about why it bothers you. Chances are she just doesn't realize.
I guess I just don‚Äôt want to make her feel bad about it. I suppose I should probably recognize that if I don‚Äôt talk to her I‚Äôd be taking all the hurt myself instead, and that‚Äôs not fair either

I regret starting HRT (TW: thoughts of suicide)	"Apparently, about three years or so ago, I asked on Reddit if it would be possible for me to start HRT without letting my Korean family know. I wrote, back then:

*""I feel bad that I've been sitting on an opportunity that many others would kill to have but welp, here I am. Everything \*could\* work out if I try. ... I'm just so happy that I flew to another side of the planet for college. And here I am, at the front door of a very big decision. I am willing to change my looks back to my own \[edit: old\] self every time I get back home. I would look different, still, and that gives me a lot of anxiety over taking this big step. What if they notice! Coming out is unfortunately not an option.""*

In the comment section, I was told that I *""won't be able to hide it from them forever""*, and that *""it's not going to last forever""* and so on. Well, a not-forever amount of time has passed since then. About a few days after that post, I came out to an irl friend for the first time. Then, in a few weeks, I was ripped out of that very friend group because I was sent back to Korea (the university decided that I should be on a medical leave.) A year after that, I moved back to the US for a different school in a completely different region. It took me another six months on my new campus to convince myself that I was finally in a safe enough place to start HRT. Back then, I decided to make just a small compromise; I wanted to stay in the closet, but I also wanted to stop myself from growing any older in a male body. In the middle point was my tentative, minimum-dosage, bootleg DIY hormone replacement therapy. And I took that chance, with no damn clue on what to do afterwards, thinking that I could, if necessary, stop taking it at any time, by my own choice.

Another year and a half has passed since I made that leap of faith. I now have been on hormones for about as much time as it took for me to go from coming out to starting hormones. I am still in the closet, since I still do not find it possible to come out to my family. But I must confess that I have, since starting HRT, worn a dress in public, felt what it's like to have guys hit on me in a bar, and confused the airport security multiple times even with my best boymode. I have been to a pride fest for the first time as myself. I have felt the weight of the silence that befell on my vocal cords when someone tried to strike a conversation with me in a dress; I have also felt the mischievous joy, when I decided, cruelly, to blink, smile, and glance away from that poor man. I have no regrets about the life that I got to live here, even if it was for not much more than a year. Maybe I do regret not having done more with it. But I do not regret any of what I did get to do.

This journey of transition is unique to each and every one of us. But it is also one and the same, in the sense that, all of us, at some point in our lives, must embark on it in order to say that we have lived at all. That is what I did, just like you did, or will. It is so strange that I can read that post from three years ago and remember being this terribly scared, terribly confused boy, barely an adult. I remember how I looked like then, how I sounded like, how I talked like, how *I was*. But I do not recognize myself in him. No matter how hard I try, I cannot mentally establish a continuity between me and that boy. But I *was* him. We also look quite similar, and go by the same name. Yet I cannot imagine a world in which I am him; *I*, not in the sense of any legal personhood, but in the sense of my own, most immediate selfhood. I am no longer him, if there ever was a time when I was him. 

I had truly, truly underestimated what transitioning actually can do.

I underestimated it back then, and only now am I seeing its true power. I did not know then, that, by deciding to transition, I had begun a process that I cannot revert nor stop. I shouldn't have thought that I could just try this for a while and then go back. Had I known. Had I only known.

There is this Jewish fable that I read when I was a child. It goes like this: once upon a time, a fox found a vineyard. It was guarded by a mighty fence, except for a small foxhole. So the fox starved itself until it could fit in, and three days later, it finally shrunk down enough to get through. Inside, it began to enjoy the delicious grapes to its heart's content. It enjoyed the vineyard so much, that it even forgot that there was something like hunger, much less the time when it wasn't inside the fence. But, when the time to go back home eventually came, the fox found that it could no longer fit through the hole, having eaten so much. At the end of this story, the fox, I think, starves itself back and crawls out of the vineyard as hungry as it was before entering. But I have wondered if the fox could ever truly leave the vineyard behind. There is nothing outside the fence that the fox truly desires. It would rather starve for three days to go inside and taste those grapes, than to eat whatever it had been eating outside. Certainly, then, hunger isn't the problem; it's that the fox desires those grapes so badly that it would rather forego eating at all than to not have the grapes. I ask, then, if the fox wouldn't rather choose to live inside the vineyard, knowing that the day when he is caught is the day he dies, than to deny himself the grapes and return to a state where he can only long for the grapes from over the fence. I ask you, if you were the fox, would have done the same.

No one realizes, I think, that they had been missing out on something until they try it out for the first time. For example, no one thinks they need to wear glasses until they try on their first pair. Just like that, I had not realized, until I tried it out for the first time, that I could have this kind of happiness. And the fox could starve, and the glasses can be taken off again, but I can't let go of this happiness. At least, I can't do it myself; someone would have to pry it out of my hands. If I had been dejected from the beginning, if I was told from the start that I could never live this life, I wouldn't have to face this loss. I would have had the option of giving up, and wait for a time when I, maybe, could look back at it again. But a loss is so much harder to bear than not having had it in the first place.

I am now facing several serious attendance and assignment problems in this college. No matter how they get resolved, I know that their conclusions will all be the same: I cannot continue my life in this campus, in this school, under my visa, away from my parents' eyes, in this country. I must, one way or another, leave the only place I know how to live in. Not only that, my parents have been seemingly noticed something; they have been quite anxious about wanting to see me again. Just now I have answered another text message from dad that I need to buy that plane ticket for the winter break. It is as if they are racing one another; who will come first, the winter break, or the dismissal notice from the school?

I do not regret the HRT and what came about it. I only regret starting the HRT. I regret having done it the way I did it. I could have waited more for a better environment. I could have even lived without doing it at all. But I chose to test my luck in such a precarious time of my life. Maybe there could have been a different time, in an alternate life, when I could have started transitioning from a much more solid ground. But I blew it, prematurely. I have inadvertently tied my life as me with the temporary living condition that being an international college student provides. Now, the continuation of my being is contingent upon me maintaining my studentship. And really, that this whole thing, this whole reflection on what my life, started because of some academic disciplinary action, is quite comical to me. I tried to draw upon some kind of anger from within, but inside I found nothing but the impressions and crumbs of past emotions that once was there. Maybe empty laughter is the sound that it makes when you press down, like a bagpipe, on the space where emotions used to be filled with.

I mean, I probably should have known this. This was supposed to come to an end anyways. I could go to grad school after college, but what after then? What difference does it make to spend a year or two more, if I am going to lose it anyways? Of course, I am not actually that content nor calm about it. But it helps, certainly, to think of it that way.

Outside, the weather is approaching winter fast. There is a sense of finality in this time and place. But for now, I am just looking back on how good it has been.

I think I can afford to be content; I just need the bravery to say that I am ready to move on and leave this all behind. I do find it regretful that I didn't see back then that there could be a more sustainable path. But also, at this point in my writing, I am coming to the realization that my regret may be misguided; if I were given that choice again, would I not choose to start HRT? If the answer to this question is yes, then all the rest of the conclusions were inevitable; it was inevitable that I would enjoy my time here too much to go back, that I would tie my fate with my being a college student, and that at the end of the day, all I could do is to enjoy what time I am given here. I dreamt of so many things; but how many of your dreams do you actually get to see come true? In that ratio, I think I could say that I have truly succeeded. I can easily imagine scenarios where I wouldn't even have achieved what I had, and it is only thanks to my rushed, uninformed choice back then that I could have done it.

Maybe this reads too much like a suicide note. But maybe I am just grieving -- ""venting"" --  the upcoming loss of my life as I know it. It could be read either way. I, for one, am not sure.

But if you had read all the way here, do you think they are any different?"	"This is so heavy. I wanted to say thank you for sharing this deeply personal note with us. 

I don‚Äôt know what the answer is. But I do know this - your fox would have been miserable outside of the vineyard. We‚Äôve all been through it. It hurts to exist when you know you don‚Äôt belong in this body yet you can‚Äôt change it. 

I don‚Äôt know what will happen when you go back to Korea. I don‚Äôt know if you can hide it from your family, what your solution will be, or if you will be cast out, have to detransition, or worse. 

It could be bad. I don‚Äôt want to sugarcoat it. And detransitioning can be an awful experience - again, like having a taste of those wonderful grapes in the vineyard and then having to go back out to the forest. But also being outed to a (presumably) extremely conservative family will also be awful. 

As bad as it may get, it is likely to pass. I‚Äôve listened to the words of many transgender people (on YouTube mostly) who have detransitioned for one reason or another. And it‚Äôs not a great experience, I wouldn‚Äôt wish it on my worst enemy. 

But it passed, and they found themselves living their best lives eventually. It may take years. Perhaps your degree will confer a new job that will grant you more independence. Perhaps something else. 

Stay strong hun. Eventually you‚Äôll have a vineyard to call your own.
I know this is fairly old, but I stumbled upon it and wow, you got a lot into this post. It's pretty deep I won't even lie. It got me at the part with the fox fable. I know exactly why you put that there and what it meant. Ever since I started transitioning, in this case, socially, I couldn't go back. I had to continue with my transition and begin medical transition. I would have rather thrown my life away completely than be seen as a woman (I'm FtM). It's insane how much my life had changed just by finding out I was trans. Sure my life was fairly dull, and I wasn't necessarily happy or content before I knew, but after I found out, my depression violently spiraled out of my control. No matter what I did, it still only progressively got worse until I got access to medical transition. I basically got the the point, equivalent to that of the fox beginning to starve from eating nothing at all. I'm completely reliant on hormone replacements, but there's nothing I can do about it. Don't get me wrong, I'm happier than I've ever been! I just recently had a bit of reality check where I had an allergy scare. It was a penicillin allergy, but I was so convinced it was my testosterone. I was so paranoid that I would be forced to stop HRT as a whole.
hi, thanks for reading this."	yupjk4	trans	18	0.82	2022-11-14 05:07:43
I spent my whole life trying and failing to be the man society told me I had to be	"I spent my whole life trying and failing to be the man society told me I had to be.  I've always been a sensitive person, but you wouldn't know it if you met me at 20. From an early age I realized that it was unacceptable for a boy to be sensitive and feminine. So I suppressed my femininity and started building a personality like a costume I was perfecting.

In my early teens I began to believe that I might be a psychopath because nearly every emotion that I displayed outwardly was faked. I faked anger to get people to hurry up or take me seriously. I faked laughter to fit in with the guys. My true emotions that I aggressively repressed began to fade altogether, and I just felt numb and empty. But despite my best efforts, I was always bullied and outcast for not being manly enough.

When I hit 21 I finally crossed the finish line that I'd been chasing my entire life. I began using steroids out of desperation to finally stop feeling like a failure of a man. I thought it was necessary to be respected and loved. Over the course of a year from age 20-21 I gained 40lbs of muscle and grew a full beard when I previously had no facial hair. Combine that with the bulging veins, being 6'3, walking around with an angry look on my face and having a buzzcut, and I finally got to the point where nobody DARED to question my masculinity for the first time in my life.

It was only at that point where I finally was left with no choice but to stop and introspect. I realized to my horror that I didn't even know who I was. Being a man always felt like acting. I thought that maybe once I got to this point of being ""the man"", I would finally feel comfortable in my skin. Instead, of course, the opposite happened and I fell into the deepest depression of my life. My entire personality was carefully engineered to shield my wounded inner child. 

I hadn't been able to cry for 5 years but now at the age of 24 when I finally embraced myself and loved myself for the first time, I spent hours sobbing uncontrollably from deep in my chest. I'm trans, and I've never been more certain of anything in my life. I'm looking forward to finally getting to know the girl within.

Love yall, stay awesome <3"	"I struggled with being male as well. Was never into sports, had no real interest in cars other than they go vroom vroom, and was made fun of because I was too empathetic and that was too ""girly"".

Little help with my family please?	"I'm mtf and 21. I'm going to be starting HRT in a few months. I finally told them after talking with a therapist.

I've had this issue for many years and getting some real world experience for 2 years. Ramping it up the more I go. But I managed to keep it hidden from them.

 one of the big hurdles they can't get over is, why dont I go more masculine with testosterone instead? I am having trouble explaining to them. 

I dont know how to relate this feeling of being normal and where I'm supposed to be to them.

It seems like they are in that anger bargaining stage of grief (of all things) and I dont know how to adult hard enough to help them.

I live half a world away and idk what to do"	"One thing that may help them accept is to tell them that if you were to regret your decision (which, we trans women know we never do, but cis people don't really understand) that it is possible to transition back even if you get bottom surgery.

Tell them that yes, you'd basically be starting out like FtMs do but that it is possible. 

(Also congrats on starting HRT! So happy for you! <3)
Oh also wanted to add that they are your parents. It's their responsibility to act like parents, you're not responsible and shouldn't feel the need to ""adult hard enough to help them"". That is absolutely not your responsibility. Make it clear to them that you are expecting them to be your parents, not vice versa.
Well I think with parents a lot of the time they thinking what did they do to cause your condition?  Do they know that you feel happier that you can express yourself now (I presume)?  While living as an out transgender person isn't always a walk in the park it's much better than the alternative of living closeted.  Maybe they will feel better about your choices if they know they are the result of the things you can't change and you are just trying to find a way to be happy.

Having been through this grief process with somebody I think too sometimes it takes a lot of time for them to get through it.
I've tried to tell them it's not their fault. They don't listen. They are looking for something or someone to blame. Its gotten a little ugly at times. I've told them I'm happier this way much more than I ever was pretending to be a man. Its awful. I just want them to not fight it so much. I'm going to start with or without them but I'd much rather have their blessing you know?"	bfcanr	trans	15	0.91	2019-04-20 13:41:16
Can we just start misgendering transphobes?	"I just wanna see how people who complain about preferred pronouns feel when we misgender them.

‚ÄúDid you see that thing with Ben Shapiro? She was totally flipping her lid over *insert whatever random thing pissed Ben Shapiro off*‚Äù

I don‚Äôt even know if I think this is a good idea, because it‚Äôs rude and disrespectful, but maybe that little taste would show them why it matters. Not that the transphobe would ever understand, but maybe their audiences would see the hypocrisy? What does the community think?

EDIT: Thanks for the input. It *is* petty, and I was feeling pretty petty this morning. I have some anger over this, but thanks for pointing out how this kind of thing is not useful. We grow as we learn, we learn as we grow üíñüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è"	"The problem with that is, while *they* don't care about being hypocrites, they *will* use any arguable hypocrisy against us.  They aren't reasonable people who would understand that it's calling out their hypocrisy but rather they would argue ""aren't you the ones who argue we should call people what they want to be called?  You're a hypocrite and now I'm going to use that as an excuse to misgender you because you signed off on misgendering those you disagree with"".  And unfortunately, they'd be right about it being seen as signing off on misgendering people one disagrees with.
If you do that, it's not going to reach the people you're hoping it will. It also won't lead to them having an epiphany about how it's shitty to do. It's just going to validate their choices and perpetuate the idea that misgendering is okay to do to a person you don't like. 

I don't think it is. Doesn't matter how much I don't like someone, I'm not going to purposefully misgender them.
I personally wouldn't, because to me someone in this sort of situation isn't going to take time to reflect on whatever point is trying to be made here.
I'd expect they'd just double down and retaliate instead, and the last thing I want is for them to think misgendering is on the table, against anyone, ever.
Petty
In line with what others have been saying, I find this to be a pretty bad idea as it will reinforce the idea that it is okay to misgender someone if you don't like them, or in other words, someone has to first become worthy in a person's eyes before they feel the need to gender them correctly. 

This kind of contingent respect is directly harmful for anyone who is seen as losing that basis for respect from society at large, which includes criminals and affects then where they may be placed in gender segregated prisons.

In a perhaps less extreme example misgendering people for any reason will generally make even some supposed allies feel free to engage in misgendering themselves if they dislike a person.
He was right in my face upset he thought I was male until I spoke. ""I am a guy"" wasn't the right answere... who would have guesses...
Ended up saying ""Not my problem Karen"" 

The joke passed him by since he obviously don't live online like me üòÖ did nothing but annoy him further asking what I had against Karen. 

Conclusion: Doesn't work. Only fules their nonsense rants.
I don‚Äôt misgender people but if they say pronouns are stupid I‚Äôll ask them publicly if they are fine being called any or nouns then, and if not then obviously they are important to them. Typically this will shut them ip, but there is always that guy that will say I get misgendered all the time and I just correct people, it‚Äôs not a big deal, which is complete horseshit.  Presenting masculine for 45 years I was never once misgendered.  So, mauve this has happened a couple times over emails or chat to this person, but not literally every day, plus they don‚Äôt dysphoria so the fact it isn‚Äôt a big deal them has no comparison to a trans person, and has a thinly veiled ‚Äúsuck it up and be a man‚Äù connotation.
Two wrongs don‚Äôt make a right
Something like that is meaningless unless it is from someone that's equally as transphobic, like if Tucker Carlson started misgendering Ben Shapiro.
The problem with taking an eye for an eye, in any case, is its usually driven more by someone's desire for revenge, rather than a desire to actually teach someone about their own actions.

I would not suggest this. They will die out on their own.
No, we cannot.
Exactly.

Misgendering transphobes won't normalize properly gendering trans people, it will normalize that some people deserve to be misgendered.
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>There is no doubt that law enforcement should be heavily scrutinizing the membership and administration of mosques.

I need to get my story out I guess. It‚Äôs going to be long so thank you for enduring if you get to the end.	"Seeing so many of you finally embrace who you are and try to live freely as yourself is truly inspiring. 

Ive hidden who I always felt I was, who I always wanted to be from almost everyone my entire life. I knew when I was 4 that I was ‚Äúdifferent‚Äù. I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I‚Äôd wake up a girl. Obviously I figured out at some point that‚Äôs not how life works, but my desire and longing to not be what I felt I was forced to be never wavered. 

I overcorrected and projected super hard to throw people off the scent of my internal struggles. Being raised in religion certainly doesn‚Äôt help with the feelings of shame and guilt. Hearing the people you love and care about say awful, hurtful or even mostly benign but ignorant things about others you identify with, works it‚Äôs way into your psyche without you even noticing. 

At some point very early in my life I figured out I couldn‚Äôt tell anyone how I really felt. That I would get in trouble and something bad would happen. So I hid. I covered it up and stuffed my real self as deep as down as I could. Which I know is so severely common for us. I know I‚Äôm not describing anything new or shocking either. If anything my experience is tame and I should feel lucky I wasn‚Äôt subjected to real violence or anger or rejection from my family because I never had the courage to let my true self out. 

I got ‚Äúcaught‚Äù so to speak a few times by my family. Random pieces of clothing in spots they shouldn‚Äôt be and things of that nature. My father was far more comfortable with me being a pervert, because telling him I was touching myself with the clothes made him sigh in relief and say ‚Äúok that‚Äôs normal. If you were wearing them then we‚Äôd have a problem‚Äù which just cemented my 12 year old self in the ‚Äúalways keep it secret‚Äù path I was on.

That secrecy led to my other self becoming a fetish and something I thought was just a weird sex thing I had. Hitting puberty changed (or I thought it did anyway) the way I looked at it. For a long time. It wasn‚Äôt until I hit 30 that I started to truly understand what I was repressing. 

My girlfriend at the time was the most supportive anyone has ever been with me. She bought me my first nice, expensive wig and asked me if she could see my other self. She did my make up and I wore a dress I really liked and I just cried when I saw myself. It was like I finally understood that this is who I really was. It broke me but in a good way. I felt so happy and giddy and just, beside myself with joy in that moment. 

I‚Äôve told a few people since then, close friends and no family. Though my parents did out me to them against my will not long ago. That‚Äôs a whole other thing I won‚Äôt get into right now. 

I‚Äôve been in therapy for a bit now, trying to get a firmer grasp or understanding of my true self. Things are coming to a fork in the road emotionally for me. I need to do something about it. Living a double life is something I know I can‚Äôt handle much longer. I know this will have consequences and I will most likely lose most if not all of my family. It‚Äôs such a huge decision and I‚Äôm worried I waited too long. 

I‚Äôm not entirely sure if I have a point here but, I guess I just needed this out of me. Thank you for being part of this space and reading my rambling."	"> I used to pray and wish and hope that every day I‚Äôd wake up a girl.

pretty sure the fact that these prayers never got answered are what turned me into an atheist.

Well, welcome to the party, girl. If you haven't stumbled across it yet, I'd suggest reading through https://genderdysphoria.fyi/ -- it helped me put a lot into context.
Your entire post is so familiar to many of us.  I didn‚Äôt think there were people like me.  I felt different and in a community of one.  Little did I know that there are hundreds of thousands of people that literally went through and felt the exact same things.
With you.. Seriously I've known since as far back as I can remember that something wasn't right and to hold it for so long is a painful experience and I respect your determination a lot.
I was thinking the same thing.  I went to atheism then decided I don‚Äôt know what‚Äôs out there so now I‚Äôm agnostic.  I‚Äôm definitely not what I was raised as, that literally cannot be true based on my (our collective) experience(s).
Thank you so much. I‚Äôm definitely checking that out.

I came out to my ex wife and co-parent this weekend...	"Honestly we've had a great relationship after the divorce.  No more fighting, we're on the same page with the kids, have been working great as a team and have actually become really good friends.  Recently I've entered therapy for anxiety and my absolute inability to trust anyone, at all.  No surprise I've been closeted my whole life, right?

Things took a hard left a couple of weeks ago in therapy when that periodic wave of dysphoria crashed in again.  I wrote a post on /r/asktransgender, and literally just bawled my eyes out as I read all of the overwhelming support that poured in.  I came clean to my therapist the very next day, and she was just a wealth of support, knowledge, resources.  It was the most difficult and validating experience I can remember.

One issue that came to the front - the entirety of my marriage, right from the beginning, my ex knew I was hiding something.  I absolutely wouldn't come clean because I assumed she would leave me on the spot if I ever told her the truth.  Ironically, she left me because of the suspicion, my depression and anger, all because of the thing I was hiding.  I might've had a chance if I'd trusted the woman I swore to trust.  I guaranteed failure by hiding.

Fast forward to this weekend.  I came clean last night to her.  I sincerely apologised for lying to her throughout our relationship.  Despite the terror of her cutting me off from the kids (she's pretty conservative), I talked, and she listened.  And, once again, I totally underestimated her.  She thanked me, and not only that, she supported me 100%.  She wants to help, feels validated and that she can move forward, and is going to help me work forward and make a plan that involves our kiddos (9 and 5 boys) in a healthy way.

I love that amazing woman.  Not as a wife anymore, but absolutely as family.  Remember, as hard as it is, there may be people close to you who deserve your trust. ‚ù§Ô∏è"	I'm so glad that she's supporting you.  That's huge.

Felt good, then I was reminded that I'm not supposed to. (I might be in the wrong)	"So i had a talk with my doctor today and in about a month i will be able to go on HRT which really made me feel happy, like a big weight was lifted of my body.

Some minutes after my mom calls. Probably for unrelated reasons. But i tell her, she knows about this. Well, first of all she says ""oh, you have to wait for a month."" I respond: ""Well it feels good, to know that its soon."" ""Oh ok"" she answers. And we talk some, i also talk about something about going to a ""Voice, trainer"". and that its kind of a long wait time for that, buts its ok. Maybe i will find someone to pay online instead, just to get some input. She then says that i could contact one of her friends. Which is a singer, I say ok maybe but she's not that kind of teacher. I would need someone else. And then she says oh ok I'm just saying that it might be good if you ask her. Which i respond with saying i don't feel comfortable telling her about this, due to my mom telling her about me being trans without my consent. And that her response was that she doesn't understund why i would want that.My mom now says that she has never said anything like that, and goes on a rant on how maybe we should not talk with each other until i feel ""happy"" and hopes that i will feel happy being a woman. Which makes me get a kind of panic attack. And she continues that she doesn't want to have contact with me until I'm happy.  So I hang up the phone. And text her in anger... Thank you for ruining my day. She responds and i quote: ""Our contact ceases here... Good luck with your life""

&#x200B;

Tldr: I had a stupid fight with my mom she doesn't want to have any contact with me anymore. I feel like shit. On a day which would be a good day due to me getting HRT. Feels like she always does this. When i feel good she reminds me about things i need to do or things I'm bad at. I feel like maybe I'm in the wrong somehow, but also I'm just really sad right now. Am i crazy for feeling like shit?"	"Your mother is being childish and making your life about her. I'm very sorry that she is behaving so poorly. 

You are not in the wrong for wanting to do things in a different way than she wants. It's your life and your transition. If she refuses to see that she's the one making you uncomfortable, that's on her.
Wow... clearly, she has issues of her own to work out which have nothing to do with you. You are not crazy for wanting to exercise your own free will, even if she disagrees.

Her last text was really petty, stuff you say to your friends in middle school and patch up the next day. Sad it should come from a grown woman.
It's not you. You attempted to set a completely reasonable boundary and your mom flipped out instead of apologizing and moving on. It sucks that she thinks that's enough to cut off contact, but hopefully she'll come to her senses.

And since your mom couldn't find any enthusiasm about your news, I'll say congratulations on the HRT progress, that's awesome and I'm so happy for you!
If this is how she acts and makes you feel, no contact for a bit might be for the best.
Thanks for support here :) Really appreciate it! A small update: She did contact me again yesterday (lol). ""and we solved it"". But i feel like i wont talk with her so much anymore. Because i feel like maybe it will be good to get some distance. Thankfully i have gotten support from friends. And also talking with my therapist about it. I feel like i really just have/want to focus on making myself feel good and talk to people which like and support me for the moment.
Thank you <3 fells a bit better, getting it of my chest.
Thank you. I feel like i don't know if I'm just annoying or if my feelings a valid due to her treating me like this for like forever. Well Thank you.
I understand. I lost family members when I came out, and even though I know it's a choice they made, I sometimes feel like I should have done or said something different to stop them. 

Hopefully she'll grow up. Even if she doesn't, though, being yourself is the best choice you can ever make.

You feelings are definatly valid she basicaly ruined you biggest trans milestone so far with petty bullshit.


And that don't talk to me untile your happy is really fucked up. Basicaly saying I refuse to provide love and support when you need it most.
I'm sorry you lost family members. There was nothing you could have done differently. If someone can't accept you for who you are, they don't deserve to have you in their life anyway. And maybe they just need time to come around. Hope your friends are at least supportive. I lost my best friend shortly after coming out. I'm still struggling with the loss."	ycexdm	trans	16	1.0	2022-10-24 15:57:46
Cutting Out Toxic People - A short, sad rant	"I've been sad tonight because I had to cut off an old ""friend"" who turned out to be a huge TERF. I dismissed their identity in RadFem ideology as just simple and understandable anger toward the patriarchy but it turns out they really do believe in gender being fixed and completely erase the nuances and complexity of gender in the patriarchy. 

Imagine getting told ""I care about all women"" when the person saying it can't even recognize the disproportionate and complex issues trans women and trans femme people face in our society.

I'm severely disappointed and I actually manage to feel like I'm somehow bad for recognizing that cisgender women have an advantage in comparison to transgender women and trans femme people."		c1y4in	trans	15	0.94	2019-06-18 05:12:42

I use pretty and feminine Fortnite skins to express myself as a woman since it's the only way I can express myself right now and people sexualizing them pisses the fuck out of me. Can anyone relate to me?	"I run a Fortnite photography account on instagram that's seperate from my main and I feel beautiful taking pictures of the pretty characters I use and writing captions for what I feel about them. The skins mean a lot to me. They're all I get to be who I really am inside. What angers me is accounts that are dedicated to showing how ""thicc"" they are, by taking videos of just their ass doing dances. They're taking what I feel is an extension of me and lewding it. What makes this worse is that people I talk to on there don't see it that way. They don't get why I'm so mad about it. Some of them don't even see it as sexual and think it's a joke. It really angers me. I hope some people here can relate?"	"I tend to make feminine avatars and play female characters, but you have to remember others don't think of it the same way you do. So while it's  fine to use them, try not to get too emotionally invested in the character
ABSOLUTLY I do the same thing with terraria. Diff is that you can make an avatar in that and no one's sexualises mothershitting terraria

My Transiversary! A year in review	"My egg cracked about a year ago, and I've arbitrarily chosen the 12th as the anniversary date, because you know, 12 = a dozen, like eggs.  Get it? I figure I'd celebrate by reflecting on everything that transpired over the past year because it's been a wild ride.  It's been a year marked by firsts, blossoming as a human being, celebrating new and old friendships, and of course, a fair share of hardships.  I apologize in advance for the length of this post.

About a year ago, I finally gathered the courage to punch into Google a burning question that had been slowly making its way to the forefront of my mind:  Am I transgender? There was a mountain of evidence, but I refused to acknowledge it for my most of my life, instead figuring I could just ignore the issue and hope it would go away -- you know, like a totally healthy, productive way of dealing with any problem, right?

So, everyone here knows that doesn't work. At least, not forever.  That feeling of wrongness grew and grew, and while I didn't exactly know what to call it, I had a pretty good idea, despite not wanting to admit it to myself.  When I finally mustered the courage to ask the question, putting what had hitherto only been an abstract thought, my greatest fear, and darkest secret into the physical world, it wasn't so scary.  I found a community of people who had those same fears, secrets, and thoughts which make absolutely no sense to the rest of world.  And you welcomed me warmly.  I finally had a community which made sense.

The first person I came out to was my best friend from high school.  She's the only person I've consistently maintained contact with after graduation, some 17 years ago now.  I called her in the dead of the night, sort of in a bit of a panic.  I had said the words out loud to myself, but I needed to say them to someone else, and I knew that no matter what, she'd be accepting.  So, I just blurted them out, ""I think I'm transgender."" After a small pause, she replied with, ""Really?"" in an inquisitive tone.  I described to her the journey that led me to that conclusion, and she added, ""Honestly, that makes sense,"" and went on to detail some things she remembers throughout our friendship that weren't exactly cis.  My spirits were lifted.  Sharing that burden with her was one of the best feelings of my life.

The next person I had to tell wasn't going to be supportive.  I knew she wasn't going to be supportive in advance, but there was no escaping it, and there was no moving forward until she knew, because she's my wife and the mother of my two children.  It took me almost a month to gather the courage to come out to her, and it resulted immediate destruction of our romantic relationship, and the near death of our platonic relationship as well, though I'm pleased to report we're on much better footing now, though we're currently separated and heading towards divorce (an amicable one, at least).  When I told her, she cried for a week straight.  I felt horrible.  She confessed that she knew there was *something* wrong, but she didn't know what, and she never would have guessed it was this.  I felt a lot of the guilt and shame that I had feared for so long.  I didn't want to hurt her, but I was hurting too, and how else was I going to make it stop?

She convinced me to get into therapy, which was a godsend.  Having someone who was completely unbiased with whom I could discuss anything and everything was really empowering.  I had an outlet for my fears, secrets, and anxieties in a judgment-free space.  She helped bring into focus this person I was becoming and gave me the tools I needed to take care of that person emotionally and mentally. She reaffirmed that the things that I was feeling are legitimate, not just some depraved fantasy, not just a mid-life crisis, not just a fetish.  She taught me how to advocate for myself and my needs and not put up with other people's attempts to bully me into being who they want me to be.

Around the same time, I reconnected with another best friend from my childhood.  We'd been best friends from about 3rd grade through high school, but we'd lost touch during our early twenties.  Amazingly, she had also come out as transgender about a year and a half prior, and she's been extremely helpful as a sort of big sister to me (despite being six months younger), offering beauty tips, tips on transition, and tons of moral support.  Our friendship picked up exactly where it left off 15 years ago, and we're closer than ever now, despite living quite far apart.

July and August wound up being a really difficult.  At the time, we'd been living overseas in the UK for the past 3 years, and I learned at the tail end of June that my company was sending me back to America in mid-to-late August, which gave me just under two months to get my affairs in order for a huge trans-Atlantic move.  My wife wound up taking the kids and leaving early, partly to go house hunting and help out with elderly family, but mostly to put some distance between us.  We were at a low point in our relationship, and she left me in a big empty house filled with years of memories both happy and sad, children's toys, and deafening silence.  I cannot adequately describe the sorrow of going home everyday from work to an empty house that has been furnished to provide a loving, safe environment to raise two children, knowing that neither of them will ever set foot in that house again. I cried just about every day for a month and a half.  Worse still, because of the global shipping slowdown and bureaucracy, by the beginning of August, the original date for my return to America was looking more and more tenuous.  I had no clue when I would be reunited with my kids.

One benefit to having the house all to myself though was I got to really explore myself in a way that I had never been able to before, and haven't been able to since.  I bought an entire wardrobe of women's clothing, got to practice my makeup, and removed all my body hair.  I was surprised at the transformation, even without HRT.  The person in the mirror was an actual-factual woman, and even FaceApp saw me as a woman.  Maybe there was hope for me yet!

I also spent that time coming out to the friends I'd made in England, knowing that if they reacted poorly, it didn't matter because I was leaving soon.  I knew at least one of them would be very supportive because she was openly non-binary (she/they), though she mostly just presented as female, so I assumed she was just using she/they for woke points, which I'm fine with.  Instead, I got the shock of my life when I came out to her -- after she congratulated me for recognizing my authentic self, she told me she was AMAB, which had me in disbelief.  She sent me some ""before"" photos and we stayed up late that night just discussing trans things, such as weird thoughts and habits in our pre-realization lives, and again, there were remarkable parallels.  Among all of my UK friends, she became my best friend literally over night, and we've remained in contact ever since.  Most of the others immediately accepted me, and switched over to female pronouns with my even asking, and the holy moly, the first time I got gendered correctly, *I was not prepared*.  The euphoria sent a tingly warmth radiating from my chest out to the tips of my fingers and toes.

By August, I'd gathered the courage to start wearing nail polish out of the house.  As I was saying my final goodbyes to former colleagues, I met up with one person in particular, with whom I'd worked in London.  He was a gay man, but wasn't super out about it.  We had bonded over RuPaul's Drag Race when we worked together.  I showed up in bright blue nail polish, and while I wound up not coming out to him, he definitely noticed, though he was too polite to say anything.  He had previously said I didn't ""seem like the type"" to be such a fan of the show, and when I asked why, he said because I was such a clean-cut, cishet man, not really the demographic of the show.  It'd always been a bit of a guilty pleasure for me, and admittedly, I wasn't sure why I was so enamoured by it either.  I guess it makes a lot more sense now, although since my egg cracked, it's become a lot less appealing, because RuPaul is just such a problematic person, and because I've definitely seen how drag queens have an inadvertently negative effect on trans women.

I came out to my mom in August, who thought I was joking at first.  She kind of freaked out when she realized I was dead serious. I video chatted with her while fully presenting female, and after the initial shock wore off, she proceeded to tear into my makeup technique, my choice of colors, my choice of attire, etc., under the pretense of being helpful, but really it felt more like uninvited criticism for the sake of making it difficult for me.  A few days later, she had some questions for me ""out of concern,"" and interrogated me on matters about which no mother has any business inquiring. She did, however, respect my wishes and kept the information to herself, for a while anyway.  She has cried on the phone just about every time we've spoken since then, describing grief over ""the death of her son,"" how the ""little boy"" she loved is going away, being replaced by a stranger.  Lay it on thick, mom. Since then, she has also offered plenty of unsolicited opinions on HRT, statistics on detransitioning and suicide, and, of course, The Surgery\^TM, most of which are well-meaning but misguided, and ultimately unwanted.  It's clear she's still trying to talk me out of being transgender.

I wound up flying back home to the US on September 1st, and reuniting with my kids will forever be one of the happiest moments of my life.  I sobbed tears of joy at the airport, which really confused my 4 year old, who didn't understand how I could be crying if I was so happy.  We basically wound up being homeless for the several months, as the housing market was insane and there was no inventory in our price range, and even limited inventory at around double our price range.  We owned a home here in the US which we rented out while we were overseas, and we were ultimately forced to evict the tenants, which was probably one of the hardest ethical dilemmas I've ever been forced into, especially due to the fact that the tenant is a genuinely wonderful person, who's well-known in my area as a leading advocate for transgender youth.  Yeah, I still feel like shit about it.

Due to my housing situation, September through November was a long period of stagnation for my transition.  We were living intermittently with various friends and family, so privacy was at a minimum.  My wife and I still weren't doing great as a couple, but we had mended fences enough that we could stand to be in the same room together, and were doing an excellent job co-parenting, especially under the difficult circumstances.  Our 6th anniversary was in October, and it wound up being pleasant, but awkward, as it was the first time the two of us had been alone together with no kids, certainly since I blew up our marriage with ""my big reveal"" as she had once cruelly called it, but probably since 2019.  There was an elephant in the room that took us half of dinner to finally address.  We addressed it, and there were apologies from both sides about how things were handled, acknowledgments about how things could have been handled differently, and a resolution to work together as a team to raise our children, regardless of what happens between us.

I came out to my dad on Thanksgiving day.  I was really terrified because I had no clue how he was going to react, but my mom basically said, ""if you don't tell him, I will.""  My mom had pretty much reacted exactly how I anticipated -- she didn't disown me or express hatred or anything like that, but she also overreacted and has behaved in a way that's really counterproductive.  She was a known quantity, which is why I had come out to her first.  My dad was a complete unknown.  I had no clue about his thoughts on trans people, other than I know that he tends to vote Republican, though he can't stand Donald Trump or his ilk, and thinks both parties suck equally. He's also fairly conformist.  I was really into the whole goth counterculture when I was a teen and he refused to be seen in public with me at the height of it. He also tends to make light of race/sexuality/gender/religious minority issues, so I was really expecting an uphill battle.  I had sort of pre-emptively stopped talking to him for a few months, because I was not expecting it to go well.  I was pleasantly surprised. He took me seriously, and told me that he didn't know how to help, other than to give me his support and love.  And that was that. I've actually found out that in private conversations between my mom and him, he's actually shut her down several times for overstepping and not showing the support I need.

In December, things had settled down.  We were back in our old house, and we were establishing our new normal.  We took a trip down to Texas to visit my family for the holidays.  One of my close family friends was having a wedding while we were down there, and we were invited.  It was quite a ways away though, so my wife and I had another protracted period of alone time with no children.  It was excruciating.  There were some issues that had remained unresolved for her, and she took the opportunity to address them while we were driving up, during which time she said some really hateful things.  I honestly don't remember what she said, just how she made me feel, and she made me feel like shit.  It was just such an unprovoked, vitriolic rage -- who was this person I was trapped in the car with? The wedding wound up being a miserable experience because of it.  She initially intended to sit in the car for the entire thing, which was ridiculous, so I insisted she come inside.  She was standoffish the entire time, and as soon as the last of the traditions was completed during the reception, she bailed, and I left shortly thereafter.  I texted afterwards to apologized to my friend for my wife's brusk behavior during her big day, and she left me on read.  I haven't heard from her since.

I came out to my three siblings while I was down there as well.  The reactions were two shrugs and a whole-hearted embrace of who I am.  My sister (she/they) is delighted to finally have a sister.  She's accepted me from the get-go and has only ever referred to me as Cassie or Cassandra since learning.  She also frequently corrects my mom when she stubbornly refuses to get it right, something that I've not even been bold enough to do.

I have another friend down in Texas I always make a point to visit whenever I'm in town.  We had worked together a long time ago, and we really hit it off back then, and have remained friends ever since.  The last time I was in town, we went out for drinks, and he had taken the opportunity to come out to me as bisexual. I was honored to be entrusted with this secret, and this time around, I intended to repay him with a secret of my of own.  I symbolically chose the same place he came out to me previously, but unfortunately, he B-lined for the bar, and between the bartender and the other patrons, there was little privacy.  After a couple of drinks, I suggested we go grab a booth, as the bar stools weren't all the comfortable, I lied.  Mercifully, he agreed.  After a couple minutes of conversation, I waited for a natural pause, and then I reminded him how a couple years prior he had entrusted me with a secret, at this very location.  I told him it was my turn to entrust him with a secret, and I came out to him as transgender.  ""Me too,"" she said, grinning ear to ear.

We spent some time trading notes, stories, etc. As it turns out, she wanted to tell me, but got cold feet, unsure of how I'd respond.  So, she strategically chose a location where it wouldn't be feasible to do so in order to take her mind off the idea of doing it. She was glad that I had taken the initiative, as obviously, it made it super easy for her.  We had a couple more drinks and then left in her car to drop me off at my hotel, excitedly swapping stories the entire way back.

In late January, early February, we travelled down to Florida to visit my best friend from high school (the one who was the first person I came out to).  She's got two kids the same age as my two kids, so it made trying to keep everyone entertained super easy.  She and I stayed up late one night to give each other mani/pedis and it was fabulous.  It was such an affirming activity, staying up late with my bestie doing each other's nails. I'm not out to my kids or to hers, but she slipped up once or twice and called me by my chosen name in front of her kids, who didn't take notice, but those were also really euphoric moments for me.  Her older daughter also saw me presenting female back in August when I had drunkenly video called.  She introduced me to her daughter as Cassie, and she didn't even question it.  She didn't care about my deep voice, or the fact that I was clearly wearing a wig.  She just immediately accepted that I was a woman, and a very good friend of her mom's.  She even met be before, as a man.  She didn't make the connection at all.  Kids are frickin' awesome.  I'm convinced that bigotry is a taught behavior.

In March, I started HRT.  It was a ridiculously simple process (YMMV, I live in a progressive area).  I just called up my local Planned Parenthood, explained the situation, and had an appointment scheduled a week after that 5 minute phone call.  I had pills in hand a day after the appointment.  Why did I wait so long?  So far, it's been a slow process, but I've got some small but noticeable breast growth.  My sense of smell has improved, and my body odor has decreased.  Every now and again, I catch a glimpse of myself in the mirror and think, wow, my face has slimmed down and femmed up! But it's only been just under 3 months, so I figure it might just be my imagination.

March was also marked by probably the most transphobic reaction I've gotten so far.  My wife accidentally let it slip to her step-mother that I was transgender back in February.  Her step-mom is a dear, sweet lady who loves everyone, without regard to superficial details such as race, gender, sexuality, etc. She measures you based on who you are on the inside, which makes it quite surprising that she's married to my father-in-law, the worlds biggest asshole.  He's your typical man's man Fox News junky, who acknowledges only two points of view in this world:  his point of view, and wrong points of view.  He has been criticizing my wife for every decision she's made since she was legally old enough to make decisions on her own.  He's always felt that she married down, and he's not shy about voicing his backwards opinions on everything, no matter how insignificant.  We knew that it would be a shitshow when he learned my secret.  

Well, he happened to learn the same day I started HRT.  My step-mother-in-law, thinking that my wife had let her know in order to break the news to my father-in-law, did just that.  He promptly called up my wife, berated her yet again for marrying a loser (the worst thing you can be in his book, and ironic given that we've successfully been living on only my income for the past 4 years), and told her not to bring me around anymore. That's all fine and dandy, as I have never had any love for the man, but my son's birthday party was scheduled for literally the next week.  I'm not invited to his house, but he sees nothing wrong showing up to mine to spend time with his grandson and just pretending like I don't exist.  It was hella awkward.  It was also hilarious, because like, clearly the only person having a miserable time was him.  Somehow, he thinks he's hurting me by refusing to share with me his hot takes on the Russian invasion of Ukraine. How ever shall I carry on?

So, that whole ordeal sort of forced my hand, resulting in me coming out to much larger group than I would have been otherwise ready for, but in light of his knowledge of my being transgender, I was worried that he might cause a scene in front of a bunch of people who didn't know.  So, to get ahead of the story, I pretty much just came out to my entire friend group. They were all supportive.

Last month, my wife and I had an earnest talk about the future of our relationship, and while we've been heading down this path for a long time, we spelled it out officially -- we're getting a divorce.  It was mutual, and it's what's best for our kids and for us.  We each need things the other can't provide, and staying together for the sake of the kids will only result in anger and resentment.  We discussed what that looks like, everything from timelines to living arrangements to custody, and we have a verbal agreement that neither of us will try to make it difficult on the other, to prevent deepening of wounds.  That conversation wound up being a huge weight off both our shoulders, and the uncertainty around it was actually the source of a lot of the hurt that we'd caused each other over the past year.  Now that it's out in the open, things are great between us, at least platonically.  We can joke and laugh and have fun over our children and the things that brought us together again.  We're living life as roommates who just happen to have two children together.

So that's been the first year of my transition.  It's been a lot of ups and downs, but I feel like I'm on the right path.  Thanks to everyone who read this whole thing.  I know it's a lot, and probably not terribly interesting or important to anyone other than me.  But as Treebeard once said, ""Why say anything at all, if you can't take a very long time to say it?"""	"Thank you for sharing your story, warts and all. It's not often you get a ground level view of a long bit of time like this.
I couldn‚Äôt stop reading. I also read your initial coming out post and OMG you described my life so accurately.  I am so happy for you finding yourself after so long. My own experience has been a little bumpy and just due to being born in the wrong decade I had to suffer a little longer before coming out. But I am at least grateful that the world has finally become welcoming enough for me to live in it and that eventually I was able to find online information and support that allowed me to begin my life.

Thank you for taking the time to write this. Seeing other peoples experiences and how similar and different they can be is sometimes so helpful.
I'm glad you enjoyed the read! I wrote this about 5 months ago, and my life has continued to improve. I'm definitely on the right track (baby I was born this way). It's always great to hear from people who felt that I've left a positive impact on them, even in such a small way. Thanks for commenting!"	uo85rk	trans	14	0.86	2022-05-12 18:51:26

Timeline: This was around 2010-2011, where the LGBT really started the beginning stages of being accepted at schools, but before the Q was officially added I believe. 

&#x200B;

Premise: I grew up being called gay by bullies and the likes most of my childhood, because I wasn't as inherently masculine as the other boys. This was before I even understood sexuality. But nonetheless, being called all kinds of stuff put me in a very repressed mindset, and I projected a lot following middle school, and into high school. 

Situation: There was this schoolmate in high school and I saw them on occasion in the hallway. I went to a performing arts high school, so it was way further ahead in terms. of LGBTQ acceptance, but not fully. So me being willfully detached from identity, I assumed they were a cis boy, but gay. But one day, they came in dressed up. A simple black dress, heels, but no detailed or heavy  makeup look. I believe they had light nude lipstick on, and earrings.  They were sitting with their cis female friend. And our school was accepting of people but that was still a foreign concept. Now looking back, I don't know if they were crossdressing, or if they were trans. I simply didn't know. But still.. I saw them. It caught me off guard. They were sitting with their Cis girl friend in the spot they always did before school started for the day. People would walk by and comment but not at them, just with their own friends but it was loud enough for both of them to hear. Most of it was mocking to varying extents. I could tell they were starting to feel uncomfortable, and their cis girl friend was drawing their attention back to her so they wouldn't have a panic attack. Cis girl friend directed her friends eyes back to hers, to focus. But their eyes wandered and hit my direction. And I just stared. 

&#x200B;

Now to add, I naturally have a resting bitch face that I cant help. And I think it came off intimidating at the time. Because at the time I'm a black AMAB and I dressed hella masculine at the time and projected such. I always projected anger, or hype bro energy to keep from being angry. But the stare wasn't intended to be a bad thing. I was just attracted to them. Like I'm pretty sure my egg cracked at that moment. There were several times it could've cracked growing up, but mix being just a young kid, and later being a repressed teen, I swept that all under the rug.  Back to this individual. They were fucking gorgeous. I felt all kinds of shit. The kind of stuff I would feel about cis women at the time, when I had a crush. The heart fluttering. Dry mouth because I was nervous. It was a legitimate off-guard moment, and I let it down, and only the surface of what I was feeling could show. I was confused, and in that moment, all kinds of shit started flowing back:

\- The time I wanted to be Sailor Moon for Halloween and my bio-dad called me a faggot and forced me to be Ghostface instead. Jealous of all my female classmates. 

\- The time I asked for more pink and lighter colored t-shirts, and the authority figures in my life telling me I don't want that.

\- And all the times I was called gay or sissy in middle school. Every day. Before I even expressed sexuality..

&#x200B;

All of it came back. I don't know how long I stared but they both eventually just started and got up and walked away. Me staring and the looks other people gave was most likely too much. All I could do was. stare, and when I really came back to, my friends nearby were laughing, about what they saw. I didn't talk to them much the whole day, but I had to revert back to hiding it all. It took a few days to put all of it back in so I could go back to being a toxic trash bin. 

&#x200B;

Fast forward to 2014. 3 years after. we graduated; When I officially could not hold much of it in anymore without experimenting and alleviating some of the dysphoria. It all came back to me, after not thinking about it for years. One of my best friends, a cis female, was open about it. She was the first person I told everything to. And she never judged me. Amongst several other things over the course of days after coming out to her,  I thought I was just telling a basic ass account of high school life but I was drunk as fuck and cried my eyes out about it because I realized how hurtful even just a STARE can be. I felt like shit. They probably didn't know that I wished I was their friend that they came out to, or just a friend in general.  I can't find them. Not on facebook, not in my yearbook, nothing. Nowhere.  
I knew their name at the time, but I can't find a trace and it fucks with me because sometimes it feels like they weren't really there, but I know that's not the case. I just have to keep searching. 

&#x200B;

So to this person, in the very small off chance that you're in this subreddit, and you can put all these pieces together:

**I am truly sorry. I wish I was as brave as you at the time. I still wish I was. I'm not there yet. But I could've been there for you. Even if I used my masculinity at the time to make sure no one fucked with you. You were so beautiful. You had a smile that I hadn't previously seen on you all the times I walked past you and your friends' chilling spot before school.** 

**I wish I could've encouraged you or complimented you. I wish I could've asked you out.. I wish I could've just been there, even as a friend. I wish you could've taught me about identity sooner. I wish I knew I was going to crack like this. I wish I wasn't so afraid of my family and friends, and the repercussions of coming out in my situation. I don't know if you've been through family abuse. But I should've risked mine to let you know you're not alone. The one time I stare without speaking my mind, was the worst time to not do so. You played a part in me finding myself. If you see this, I hope you know that, and I hope you can forgive me.** 

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

TL;DR: I'm sorry for not being brave."	Karma really can be a bitch. Good luck hon and thank you. I hope she's out there reading this.	c79s56	trans	16	0.94	2019-06-30 05:56:00
Rant About Everyone Feeling Sorry For My Parents	" 

I posted this in another community but I want opinions so I thought I would also post it here since this one is bigger. Now onto the rant.(Question is at the end)

&#x200B;

I don't have anywhere I can post about this on social because I have family on all my social media. But it angers me how sympathetic people are towards my parents.

Trigger Warning: Feelings towards parents who say they are supportive but don't show any sign of change.

For some backstory I came out about a year ago as a trans man and next week I will start my first dose of T. My parents said they support my choices in life but haven't made a single effort to call me by my new name or correct pronouns. Saying they will change when I do(physically).

So far when I try to vent to people they are always like ""Well they are being supportive it just takes time. It's really hard for them and you just need to give them time."" Yeah I get that. But one thing I never thought would piss me off so much is that not one single person ever asks how hard it was for me. Yeah I know the people in my life are affected by this, but who is more affected the person who has to see themselves in the wrong body every day or the person who just has to call me a new name?

It angers me so much more than I ever thought it would because I am VERY understanding person. But why am I so mad then? I know others out there and even on here aren't accepted by their parents and I should be happy mine at least say they will change eventually. But I am just made that they get defended more. People act like I shouldn't be upset and I should try and be understanding to their feelings. But no one ever tries to be understanding to mine. ""They'll change eventually, that's better than what some people get"" Yeah but it hurts hearing my birth name every damn day. It hurts to be reminded of my biological sex every day. Sometimes my dysphoria gets so bad I will cover all the mirrors and won't leave my room. But no one sees that, so they feel bad for my parents.

I guess I just wanted to vent and rant about it somewhere where I felt safe to do so. Where it won't get back to them and I can just feel what I am feeling without being told I need to consider their feelings for once.

Thanks if you read this far btw, you don't have to reply I just wanted to get it out. If you do feel like replying then I have a question of sorts. I feel like the best course of action is to just ignore what I can't control and enjoy my journey but it's hard at times. What do you do to or tell yourself that helps you keep on that positive mindset?"	"Your parents need to try harder
i skipped to the questions as i was just checking quickly but i always just tell myself that i cant let others bring me down, i do my best to live by a poem i had saw called ""hate"" the message is that we can hate all we want be all that will do is divide us more, sometimes we just have to love a little, sometimes people just dont understand and need it taught to them

i suggest you give it a listen, (vary vary bad slurs as it is about racism)

I have a similar story.

I have a father and I came out as transwoman. I told him to change my pronouns from male to female, and he said it would take time.

THAT WAS 5 YEARS AGO.

He didn't change the damned pronoun, nor my name since then. And guess what? HE'S A TRANSPHOBIA.

I'm not gonna say that your parents are the same, but if that continues a year after, try doubting your parent's support. They might not that supportive than you thought they do.
Well for my parents my mom tried but dad doesn‚Äôt really at all. I think for him maybe its like he is losing a son or something but im just like come on I know I was in denial but I don‚Äôt have the hours in the day to help everyone come to grips with it. My dad of course I do its just a painfully slow process and my dad is pretty oblivious unless I walk into the room wearing a skirt I don‚Äôt think he would notice. Ive already corrected him a few times. Part of me is like maybe I just need to act way more feminine but then id just be sort of faking it and im doing this to be my genuine self not fake it. Its definitely frustrating but hopefully when im closer to passing he will only be able to call me his daughter. I think since im an only child they only had experience with me but if id had an uber masculine brother or sister they would have definitely seen the contrast. Im not saying if you are this you have to act like this. Its just I naturally act pretty feminine to the point everyone in my highschool was completely convinced I was a gay guy. To me it makes no sense but in cishet society to them feminine guy means gay to them for some reason and it took a while to just decode that. Id like to say just be patient but it sounds hypocritical when im getting frustrated myself with what feels like im having to raise a snail in a who can move slower competition. I suppose the big positive so far is getting to wear what I want and im not having to hide it and I can quit faking being a guy. Im not sure any of this really helped but fwiw maybe at least working on your wardrobe getting more masculine clothing would help you? It may not make you have the patience of a saint (I know i dont) but it might give you a boost and some euphoria while you are dealing with it what will hopefully be parents who call you by your correct pronouns.
Yeah, I don‚Äôt wanna be rude, but fuck your parents. That excuse is bullshit, and they‚Äôre getting points for it. They aren‚Äôt even making an effort to change. That excuse only applies if they‚Äôre making an actual effort to change, but they‚Äôre doing nothing. Tbh, I just think they‚Äôre transphobic and don‚Äôt wanna say it because they‚Äôll get trashed socially for it
Oh, fuck them! That's a bullshit answer! And they get zero points for ""changing eventually"". They can get some credit when they actually fucking try. That answer pisses me off to no end! We have power over others, what we say and how we treat people that are invested in us has a big effect. You told them that they're hurting you, and they chose their own iota of comfort over alleviating your near-constant pain. Then they tell you that they might consider trying if you put on a good show for them, that a moustache is worth more respect from themvthan you are, and they get fucking praised for being so progressive and supportive. Fuck them and fuck the people that say they're doing you a favor! It's passive-aggressive shit is what it is! Passive-aggressive abuse like this drives me fucking berserk! ""I was being all calm and you flipped out and mhemhemhe."" I could punch someone in the goddamn throat right now!

Sorry. I agree with you. These type of non-committal, praise-me-for-not-shitting-on-you kind of responses drive me, well, completely berserk. I got a lot of ""How could you raise your voice, you terrible boy?! All he was doing was destroying your sense of self-esteem and security. He didn't have to raise his voice to get his point across, that you're worthless."" when I was young. I try to be peaceful, but passive-aggressive bullying will absolutely drive me to hit a motherfucker with a chair. I'm not proud of that.
It‚Äôs possible your parents think it‚Äôs a phase.

Do you think they‚Äôd be open to learning more about transgender people? Watching some documentaries or doing some reading?

I‚Äôm a dad of a transgender girl, it was hard for me to understand at first. I didn‚Äôt know anything about trans people except seeing the ‚Äúfreak show‚Äù spectacle type stuff on Jerry Springer and daytime TV.

These documentaries (plus some podcasts and reading) really helped me to understand it more and that made a big difference. I also joined a support group for parents of trans kids, and it was really helpful to speak with other parents, some of whom were further along in their understanding.

yeah you have the right to be mad because your parents really aren't trying. you should not need to medically transition in order to be recognized as your gender and just generally as who you are. they are stalling and they are doing it intentionally. there is nothing stopping them from just changing now, they just dont want to. im really sorry and i know how hurtful that can be.

  
is it possible for you to tell them how hurtful it is for you? if you can maybe write it down and get it very clear maybe you can tell them that you would like to be respected as who you are all the time, not just when you fit their specifications of what they think a man is. you can tell them that it feels like they are rejecting and harming you and that it would really improve your mental health if they started gendering you properly. if they start going on about how hard it is for them tell them that it can be a hard adjustment for anyone but its a necessary one and its also stressful for them to unload their emotions about it on you. if they need there are support groups for parents of trans kids who can help them process those emotions while striving to gender you correctly that way all parties can be happy.

  
that being said, i dont know your family and i dont know how comfortable/safe you feel having that conversation. if you choose to do so try to make sure you have somewhere or someone to fall back on if things dont go well. best case scenario you have a therapist but even an understanding friend or utilizing coping mechanisms (journaling, meditation, ect.) can be helpful. either way i wish you luck and hope you have much more understanding parents than mine.
Thank you for the recommendation, I'll give it a listen right now.
Honestly my entire life I have dressed more masculine and if you look back at pictures of me when I was 13(before I had a chest but had stereotypical ""guy"" hair cut) you would not be able to tell I was a girl if you didn't know. My whole life people got my gender wrong and I never really corrected them. I wear binders now when I can and as safely as possible. 

&#x200B;

I feel like we are in the same boat, I feel as if when I look more like a guy and sound more like a guy they will feel more comfortable calling me one. But idk, it's just taking forever with them. Like once I have a deeper voice and facial hair it'll be pretty hard to pretend everything is the way it used to be I think. 

&#x200B;

It's mainly my mom I have the most issue with. My dad tries from time to time and gives me guy tips and stuff. I think he mostly just feels awkward about the whole thing because him and I don't really know each other. He just worked my whole life, nothing wrong with that I guess, but I am not very close to him."	oh29xv	trans	14	0.94	2021-07-09 19:02:37
It can be exhausting and depressing dealing with transphobes. I‚Äôm mostly desensitized to it now, but when I see how awful it makes others feel I get angry. I decided to channel that anger in a creative way.			itk9gu	trans	15	0.87	2020-09-15 23:35:07
my sibling‚Äôs gender identity	"Hello all! I want to start out by saying : i have nothing but respect and love for everyone in the trans community. Im here simply for some advice and hopefully some answers to my questions. Forgive me if i mistakenly say something offensive and please correct me. 

Ok so my sibling (biologically my brother) has been talking about being transgender. She didnt come to me to tell me, my parents told me without her consent. Which i thought probably isn‚Äôt good. Ok, so she tells everyone at school she wants to go by Rosa and she/her. So thats what i and everyone start to do.  The thing that confuses me is that Rosa doesnt make any attempt to change her appearance. I have offered many times to go shopping to buy dresses or skirts or any sort of feminine clothing but she never wants to. I also have tried to offer to paint her nails but she doesnt want to. 

To make this Situation more complicated,the name rosa originates from is a character she made up who is this fox mom. She says that she is a furry.  I‚Äôm confused, is being transgender  to rosa a furry thing or an actual identity? and why does she not want to try to be feminine if she wants to be a girl. Also A couple weeks ago I overheard a conversation with her and my mom and Rosa said that being transgender was just an easier way to explain that they‚Äôre a furry. Which I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs OK because if that‚Äôs true she is lying to all her teachers and friends. But when I brought this up later with her, she said that that‚Äôs not what she meant and that they r transgender but also a fox. Which is really weird for me not the transgender part by the Fox part and I don‚Äôt really know how to deal that side of it. 

 Our relationship is pretty rocky, she has anger issues and depression and have not been kind to me a lot of the time so I think I still have some resentment there. Also what bugs me is rosa thinks being a furry should be included in the lgbtqia+ which I don‚Äôt personally agree with being a member of the LGBT community myself. 


Ok basically im just conflicted because I want to respect her if they are actually transgender but I also feel uncomfortable if she is actually just lying to explain her furry thing. 


Im sorry if i said something stupid here. I would really like to hear your opinions on this and how I should go about dealing with my siblings identity


 thanks for reading"	"Hmm, As a furry, I don‚Äôt think your sibling is explaining what a furry is in the correct way. Being a furry is a hobby, not a identity. I understand if you might feel a little uncomfortable, it might be best to help clear up the fact with them that being a furry is not an identity at all
I mean, for a start in your post you said Rosa wants to use she/her, but you use they/them and at one point he/him instead which isn't great.

As for the clothes thing, presentation isnt the same as identity. She could want to look like a tomboy, or could still be coming to terms with some of the mental blocks from gender stereotyping, or a million other things.

I dont really have an opinion on the furry part either way.

Being trans is hard and Rosa will need tine to be comfortable with what she wants to do as her next steps before doing them.
sorry if this comment is formatted weird i‚Äôm sleepy
- you‚Äôre right that it wasn‚Äôt okay for your parents to tell you for her unless she asked them to
- how you dress isn‚Äôt what gender is, it‚Äôs just how people express themselves. plenty of women men and non-binary people express themselves in ways that don‚Äôt line up with traditional gender roles. you could probably find some examples of yourself doing this in big or small ways
- names come from wherever. there isn‚Äôt a way to evaluate when one name is more legitimate than another. if she chose her name from a character she created that‚Äôs p cool
- sometimes gender isn‚Äôt as easy to pin down or it feels so abstract that some people find it easier to explain it as another thing (like an animal or object). maybe that‚Äôs what being a fox means to her. i can‚Äôt really speak for her though
- choosing her name and pronouns and referring to herself as trans isn‚Äôt deceptive or harmful. it‚Äôs how she wants to be seen and addressed
Ugh its difficult to say ,i wish i could be of help but the best advice i can give is to encourage rosa to work through this with a therapist speciallizing in transgender matters  , i think its not fair to jump to conclusions because maybe rosa is still not sure  so its why i think ita a good idea to see a therapist
sooo as a trans furry i think that she maybe explained it wierdly and that brought you to this conclusion, 

obviously being a furry isn't a gender identity the fact that she picked the name of a furry character doesn't mean that she thinks that beign a furry is part of lgbtqia

 (obviously i dont know if she said it outloud, im just assuming that she said something and that confused you and you thought that ,if not sorry for my mistake)

also she may ment by the furry thing that she made the character and it made her realise she would like to use that name and pronouns

(i dont have information if they made character but the point still stand even if they didnt she saw the character and could have started questioning) 

also with the femenine clothing thing, clothing dont mean gender, maybe she wanted to be a tomboy who knows?
Well, maybe a third party support could help her to see the difference, most of the time little kids (I suppose she is little) get confused with their surroundings, and more when they don't have a regulation on the internet use, talk it with your parents, tell them your concerns, and, in some way, try to teach your sibling the difference between something you like and something you identify. And try to be patient, maybe she's trying to find her place in the world, but, she first needs to see and understand what is being a transgender, and what is liking the furry style. Hope I helped <3
I see what you‚Äôre saying here. I guess i didnt take in account that clothes arent identity. I also didnt realise i used he/him at one point so sorry about that. I used they/them bc i guess im just confused about whether rosa is trans or not. But i see that is unfair of me so i went back and changed the pronouns.
Well, about the dysphoria, I think is a bit more complicated, it can be experienced in a lot of different ways, but, maybe she is gender fluid or who knows.
You're all good, it can be hard to adjust to. You can be trans without dysphoria, gender euphoria is another good way to tell but neither are required to be trans.
I would take her at her word that she's trans, doubting will just make it more awkward for everyone <3"	p1kgwh	trans	13	0.93	2021-08-10 07:34:58
I‚Äôm a wannabe writer with one book published. I recently thought of an idea of an uncracked and formerly transphobic transgirl discovering herself in a fantasy setting and wanted to share to see what people think	"
Fantasy world where lgbt is alive as it is today.
Mc is an uncracked trans girl(doesnt know shes trans) and is a bit transphobic with a mix of growing up in a lgbtphobic home and religion as well as being confusingly jealous towards people who get the transition using new and ever-evolving potions. (Basically she lets out the misunderstood jealousy she has as anger and hate because she‚Äôs too afraid to figure herself out)
One day, during some sort of thing, a very valuable new potion that instantly changes a person‚Äôs gender instead of doing so over time gets somehow applied to her on accident.
Basically changes her outer body to that of what she unknowingly wants.
She has to go on a journey to find ingredients so the potion makers can make an ftm one for her, but along the way she comes to find she feels alot better in her new body. Becomes less toxic and hating, and begins to understand theres nothing wrong with people in the lgbt community.
She ends up deciding not to take the potion to change back but also decided she needs to take out this fantasy worlds big evil(cause every fantasy world HaS tO hAVe tHem), which is actually a pretty big cause of lgbt hate. The villain is lgbt themselves, and so many people on the outside correlate the villain being lgbt and evil as the same thing. Basically why many ppl think lgbt is evil.
So she decides to join an lgbt positive party wanting to take down this villain with her newfound understanding

One of the scenes I‚Äôm really excited to write goes along the lines of this:

While searching shes also gonna meet the lgbt group she teams up with but DOESNT KNOW ITS THEM
So she hangs out with them and gets to know them
Then she lets one of the members in on the secret that she honestly enjoya her new body and doesnt rly wanna go back and shes like ‚Äúgod idk whats wrong with me‚Äù and what not
And the person shes talking to is all like ‚Äúoh theres nothing wrong with you! {leader of the group} is like you! He likes his more masculine body better!‚Äù
More chitchat until mc realizes its the lgbt group and she runs away 
But after she settles down alone shes all like ‚Äúthey werent bad people. They were nice! Etc etc. nothing is wrong with them they just wanna be them. They arent evil for that‚Äù"		kiybd2	trans	13	0.93	2020-12-23 18:24:36
Grieving the 'lost years' - how can I move on?	"Hi /r/trans;

Short version: I'm transitioning in my late thirties, and I'm currently feeling what I can only describe as 'grief' for the years I lost. I'm really struggling to process this, and hoped others had insight as to how to proceed forward.

Long version: it was pretty obvious that I was trans from the early teens onward; but unfortunately, I grew up in a place where that wasn't a lot of representation and I never really connected the dots. I moved to a considerably more permissive city for college, and started to feminize my appearance (while attributing to a 'goth phase'). I was dangerously close to cracking my proverbial egg.

I then met the love of my life; joined her in the Midwest; and brought a wonderful daughter into the world. Between the rather less permissive attitudes in the area, and molding myself into a provider for my family (i.e. embracing my own father's work ethic, but also the masculine ideas that accompanied it) the egg-cracking was permanently shelved.

Over the next fifteen years, things began to change: my wife and daughter both gained trans friends (informing my worldview); I started reading up on the subject. In February of last year, the dam finally broke; and my family have been very supportive as I started transitioning. (I began HRT, at the start of this year, but there were some issues with my levels and I think it's only in the last three weeks it's really beginning to kick in - I also wonder if that's having an effect on my thinking.)

My wife sent me this deeply sweet [comic by @eunnieboo](https://twitter.com/eunnieboo/status/1117607828670173184); showing a couple very much like us growing old together. Unexpectedly, I find myself in an emotional tailspin - I've spent the weekend sobbing uncontrollably; in particular, I keep finding my thoughts return to the last two panels of the second page (where the couple start their relationship, and marry).

I'm not great at making sense of my own emotional state, but the best I can describe how I currently feel is 'bereavement' - as if I'm mourning a timeline that never existed; one where my mind and body were already aligned and I lived as a young woman and mother, not man and father. There's also an undercurrent of anger at the world I grew up in and the unfairness of it keeping me from realizing my true self.

Is this a normal experience? What can I do to move past this?"	"I feel this. ‚òπ
I think it's completely normal. I'm NB and not really transitioning, but I have ""lost years"" too, because of a chronic illness that basically confined me to my bed.

Not having lived this time the way you were supposed to fucking sucks. There's nothing to change it, and it will always suck.

Moving on is different for everyone. For me, it's finishing school and hopefully getting into university, even though I'm way later than most. For you, maybe it could be achieved through the changes you're going through anyways.

You are a mother now. You can renew your vows in a dress and marry your wonderful wife all over again. You will make tons of beautiful memories where you get to live the way you were always supposed to. 

The lost years are shit, let's be honest, but just because they're shit doesn't mean they didn't affect your later life in a positive way. You met your wife, had your daughter and built a family. Those things are huge. It may not be the same as doing it the way you wanted to, but you still did it, and it's a huge achievement. 

For me, I need to remind myself that my lost years weren't really lost. Everyone else graduated, went to university, found a job, some even have kids and are engaged now. But I achieved different things. I'm healthy now. I'm alive and as well as I'll ever be, and honestly, the fact that I didn't off myself between major depression and really bad pain is also badass in it's own right.

Your lost years weren't entirely lost, as well. There were happy moments too. Yes, they could have been happier, but that doesn't change the fact that you did the best you could at the time.

You are now exactly where you're meant to be, even if your path took a bit more time.
i don't think u can ever fully move on and never think about this though it's not gonna hurt in the near future though the best advice i can give u is wear, watch, do anything you have always wanted to and missed out on and don't care about what others think just know u don't grow up u just grow older in age \*sending love from ur trans sister\*
I'm sorry that you are going through this pain also. If there's a small silver lining here, it helps me to know that I'm not the only one; and so I hope that you too feel a little less alone as you make your way through this.
Thank you for taking the time to reply and share your thoughts! It's really helpful to me to understand that there are others that have or are going through this process and how they are making sense of it.

I'm sorry that you had to deal with that illness. What you describe sounds very much like what my wife went through. In her case, she suffered for many years from an diagnosed mental illness; when she did receive help, it was transformative - but it also opened up similar feelings in regard to how much sooner it could have come, and how much further along in both her mental health journey and life in general if she had.

And it hurts. It hurts so, so much. At my lowest, the same primitive thought keeps echoing in my head: ""I wish I *was* a girl""; ""I wish I'd *had* that wedding""; ""It's so unfair."" And it is - but time moves on regardless. There's no going back.

I do see at least one positive upside to this: my journey has been one plagued with doubts (a common situation, I'm sure) and one that I've been relatively secretive about (for whatever reason, I believed that I couldn't socially transition, couldn't claim female status until I had put in sufficient legwork on the physical side.)

Now I understand that the depth of feeling I'm currently experiencing is a direct result of the mismatch between my mind and body. Those doubts are erasing, and I'm seriously considering just opening up to the whole world on who I am.

Similarly, those lost years weren't lost: with virtually no resources, I was able to move 3,000 miles to be with the greatest woman I've ever known; and together we carved out a life for ourselves, and raised an amazing daughter. It's an achievement to be proud of; much as you yourself can take pride in fighting your way through your illness.

I'd be lying if I said I wasn't crying again, but at least this time it feels bittersweet and a little more optimistic.

Thank you again for your kind and meaningful words!
Thank you for the kind and thoughtful words! I agree - I can‚Äôt take back that lost time, but I can make up for it. There are things I‚Äôve been holding back on (e.g. makeup) because I felt I hadn‚Äôt progressed far enough in my transition - but maybe I have it backwards; maybe if I embrace those things now, I‚Äôll feel as if I‚Äôve made more progress. And the more progress, the less the lost time will weigh on me.
I'm happy this helped a bit!

Also, if you want that wedding in a beautiful dress, and to get some new wedding photos to hang on the walls, I think renewing your vows would be a great idea. You can plan something really romantic and repropose to your wife, because let's be honest, she's showing you some new shades of amazing right now. 

You have your daughter to be a flower girl or bridesmaid or maid of honour, and it doesn't even have to be huge if you don't want it to be. 

I'm a huge sucker for weddings, so I might be biased, but I think it would be a wonderful gesture. Because even though your situation as a family has changed, she still loves you, you still love her with all your heart, and that's just one of these classic, sappy gestures to show your love.

Also the dress.
My wife and I both very much love the idea! (Especially as we never had a wedding proper - just a court ceremony.)

She really is an amazing person - her circumstances growing up were heartbreaking, and she has the scars (both mental and physical) as proof. Not only did she fight her way through it, but developed the biggest, most caring, most loving heart of anyone I know - and has worked so hard, every day, to improve her mental health.

It says everything about her that she accepted me for who I am without hesitation. It is a privilege to spend the rest of my life with her.

(You know what else is interesting? My wife has always communicated the strength of her love for me; she would tear up trying to describe it. I loved her just as much, but only knew how to communicate that by providing. Just a couple of weeks with the HRT mix finally right and now I‚Äôm struggling to utter the words ‚ÄúI love you‚Äù without crying myself! It really makes me wonder if my brain was always meant to work this way.)

There are next steps to be had (and somehow it all needs to be paid for), but I really like the idea of celebrating the end of that process with a proper wedding.

Thank you again! You‚Äôve been a tremendous help and I greatly appreciate it.
There are quite a few studies that show trans people have the brain structure of the gender they identify with - so I am VERY sure that your brain is meant to work this way.

Also, I'm tearing up because you and your wife are now my new relationship goals. I hope the two of you stay just as wonderful and happy as you are <3
I was superficially aware of the one brain structure study, but didn't realize there had been more! I find it reassuring to know that there's a scientifically quantifiable phenomenon at the heart of all of this.

I also think you're right - my brain finally seems to be working the way it was always supposed to. For most of my life, I've had what I would describe as a low-level of anger simmering in the background; I didn't even realize it was a thing until it disappeared! Likewise, my emotions feel so much stronger now, and more vivid.

(I can't even believe I'm inspecting my own mental processes, and analyzing them, and communicating what I'm finding! It used to be that if I was upset, my brain would just shut down and forming even a coherent sentence was a challenge.)

It's overwhelming, but also highly welcome.

Thank you also for your kind words regarding my wife and I. There have been some real challenges along the way; but there are several principles that have guided us through. We're a team; we're committed to the success of that team; that communication is vital to success; that we should never take one another for granted, and always strive to improve; and finally, that we'll spend our whole lives growing and changing, and that this is a feature and not a bug. 

I'm so grateful for my wife! As the comic depicts, I hope to grow old and gray with her, and that we find even greater happiness together. May you also find such joy in your own life - it sounds like you've very much earned it!"	g4s31w	trans	14	0.9	2020-04-20 12:43:09
A hateful hostess and server only fuel my love and kindness toward others	"Today, I went to pick up a take-out order at a restaurant. While waiting for my food, two staff members were discussing me at a loud volume. The tone was harsh and the words were quite vulgar. I won‚Äôt share what was said but I was taken aback to say the least. I stared in shock for a few seconds. Then, I left. 

I could let this incident reinforce my anxieties and fears. And could allow her words to poison my mind and heart. It would be easy to let hatred and anger take me over. But, why should I?  I don‚Äôt want to have a bad day. And I don‚Äôt want anyone else to have a bad day either. I want to spread love and kindness. I want you to know that you are amazing and beautiful and smart! Remember, your words are powerful. And people are listening.

25 transfemme - pre everything - closeted. Was looking at gender affirming femme outfits via my fb avatar and started crying	Basically what the title says. I started playing around with my fb avatar to update it since i deleted my denial forest beard out of existed and shave my face regularly now and i started crying looking at gender affirming femme outfits i can‚Äôt wear yet. Anyone else done this or am i being dumb? Even though I‚Äôm not on any hrt yet, accepting myself as a woman has made me connect more with my emotions as opposed to running from them and using humor,indifference and anger as a mask	"Oh yeah, absolutely. Spent the first month or so playing around with various avatars, window shopping Amazon, and listening to all the ""girly"" music that I've secretly enjoyed but avoided during my denial years. I cried more than I ever had in my life since I was no longer constrained by the ""real men don't cry"" bullshit and deprogrammed years of internalized transphobia and shame. I unburdened myself.

Transformation starts with self acceptance.
Ok I‚Äôm glad to see this checks out. I‚Äôve been reconnecting with the girly artists I felt like i wasn‚Äôt allowed to like and having a blast the past few months as well as doing the other things you listed and it feels euphoric

How do Y‚Äôall cope with the social rough patches of transitioning? (Warning-long post)	"My issues: 

Friends- all of the friends I had pre-transition ? I lost them.... ALL ... primarily because of my transition. it was the case of ‚Äúyes I accept you‚Äù until I actually started my journey then they could no longer cope with the changes or got ‚Äúweirded out‚Äù. They would find random reasons to exclude me from plans... which turned into them no longer texting back or anything.I struggle opening up to new people due to my fear of them rejecting me because I‚Äôm Trans (something I can‚Äôt change) 

Family- I used to have the BEST bond with my family .. which all went down the toilet. My mom became jealous of my progress, & so did my sisters .. they broadcast that anger and insecurity onto me...which caused our relationship to rapidly decline.

Dating- oh god, don‚Äôt even get me started on men... I‚Äôm fairly passable ... so men will often invite me out to dinner or out for a drink ... when I disclose my transgender status they either A. Run for the hills or B. Solely use me to fulfill their sexual needs. The idea of going out or building a deeper connection with me goes out the window. 

Conclusion- All those elements combined led to me developing depression. Which snowballed into other areas of my life.. I just want to be a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù woman , with a ‚Äúnormal‚Äù social life... On the flip side ? I became sort of famous on social media with my views skyrocketing .. society has this odd fascination with us. 

Will I ever find people who wholeheartedly accept me?"	"This is sadly way to relatable üòî I literally also lost all my friends they all were accepting when I came out but now no one even messages me anymore. It‚Äôs always me to message them and if I do, I can feel their discomfort talking to me and wanting to end the conversation asapüòî

My dad and sis aren‚Äôt accepting me either but it‚Äôs getting better since I came out I just hope one day they‚Äôll accept me as the woman I amüò©
And honestly I don‚Äôt know how to deal with this I just cry all the time üòî 
I‚Äôm to scared to even do dating because of the reason you mentioned 

Well I would say mostly the only people wholeheartedly accepting us are our trans sisters and brothers ‚ù§Ô∏è
I stick to finding friends and making new family in the community. It skips the whole acceptance thing as most people in the community are accepting. Not that I‚Äôm not open to making friends outside of the community when they come up, it‚Äôs just that they don‚Äôt usually come up haha.

I‚Äôm so sorry that this is what you went through with your transition, you‚Äôd deserve better
I don't know. I don't have an answer to this. Cispeople will most likely either fetishize you or hate you with no in between on today's society.

I am sad. And angry that we have to deal with this and all of these violent words and reality checks about ourselves that are false AND uncalled for.

Edit: to answer your question, I just suck it up and cry when I'm alone. It will maybe, someday go away as I get used to it. But it shouldn't be normal."	kkkwss	trans	13	0.93	2020-12-26 16:11:03

Before I got my top surgery i was having breakdowns like this every time I had to go out, to the point were I stopped going out all together. I know it's so so difficult to just want to get out of your head and go do something fun, but then feel a wave of dread when you realize you need to get dressed and present yourself to the outside world. It hurts. I'm still trying to figure it out too, but just know that you're not being a baby, you are totally valid and really strong to have to be dealing with all this.

‚ÄúI Think I Want to Change My Name‚Äù	"I was looking through an old Pinterest board with all of my O.C.s in, and I found a board called ‚ÄúRain.‚Äù As I looked through it I realized that Rain is just what I think id look like if I was AFAB.. She was made at a time that was super vulnerable and tentative for me, so I couldn‚Äôt see her for what she really was, an allegory for myself. She is what I want to be so desperately, I don‚Äôt find her attractive, I don‚Äôt know of any other reason that I would be trans other than just straight up being trans. I want to metamorphosis into her. She‚Äôd the baggage of my old life, become what I always secretly was. She is me and I am her. We are the same.

I feel this need.. This need to reconceptualize myself with my reality and my inner personality. I love feminine things, not at the expense of traditionally masculine things, but in spite of being raised to like nothing but them. I am a woman, and nothing can change that. My recent reframing of Steven from a masculine person to an intersex enby is evidence to this. I have spent much too long worrying about the reaction that will happen to my reality, even as the people closest to me have parsed themselves out of or into my life. My non-binary attributes seem to me to be a by-product of my artsy vision of the world around me. Ive been mistaking eccentricity for an intrinsically non-binary soul. I am a wonderfully eclectic woman! I spend my time listening to off-killer music and sketching the oblong image of the world around me. I am fueled by anger but not controlled by it. I‚Äôll live in a cottage near the highlands and rent an apartment near the university where I work. Ill sketch the strange nature of the face-folk as they dance throughout my backyard. Ill write soliloquies and limericks in gal-liege and teach myself all of my favorite Beatles songs. I will define my existence.

For what is a person but a collection of identities defined by restraint. It has taken me entirely too long to realize my reality, even now I wonder what further impact upon my personality my childhood has left. The people I perform for, my family, my coworkers, even some of my friends, they have left scars on my soul. I see my parents in the mirror, my siblings in my nightmares, my old friends in my dream of yesteryear. My personality up until this point has slowly been stifled and buried for the comfort of others. Yet I am still me, I could not help but let myself seem through. I was lucky to have real friends there to spot and nurture the me that never lived beyond the hollow shell of the life I had endured thus far. They helped me understand that it was okay to let myself live. I was further coaxed out by the gentle words of wisdom and comfort shown to me through cartoons. They gave me the words to describe my condition, and the images to dream of my eventual escape. I am done hiding in the dark, I am finished letting myself be described by those who have rejected me. I am free at last!"	"Beautifully written, and congrats on discovering yourself!

Thing that has surprised me: Different flavors of dysphoria.	"One thing that has been an interesting, and upsetting, surprise to me since I came out to myself is the different kinds of dysphoria one can feel.

Understand, before I came out to myself, I didn't realize I was experiencing dysphoria.  I just thought I had a serious self-loathing problem, and was fairly depressed.  I wasn't suicidal, I didn't self harm physically, and I functioned.  I mean, I said some REALLY eggy shit (""I'd obviously prefer to be a woman, men suck, but I am this, and I gotta deal with it""), but I still got by.

Once I realized I wasn't cis, nearly all of that lifted.  After some research, I came to realize this was an internalized dysphoria, manifesting as self loathing.  It felt heavy, and syrupy.  It felt like my everything was weighed down.  It was a limiter on being happy.

Since then, I've experienced two other distinctly different kinds of dysphoria.

The first is, what I understand to be, a fairly traditional dysphoria.  It's realizing that I differ physically from what I understand myself to be emotionally.  This is usually brought on through trans music, writings, or something I make myself, like a poem or an entry on here.  It's the crying, the mild to moderate panic, the anger.  Most of us are familiar with this.

Then, there is what I've started referring to as ""itchy"" dysphoria.  I get this when I have to present male, like at work, or when I do something like going to long since my last Nair session.

Itchy dysphoria feels like wearing a wool jumpsuit with nothing underneath, but emotionally.  It's, like, mildly aggravating, and irritating.  It builds up over time, until I just HAVE to get into some confirming clothes, or get this body hair off, or shave my damned face.  It is frustrating, and bothersome, and well, ""itchy"".

Anybody else get these?  Anybody else get any others?  I'm curious what I might run into down the line.

Love you all."	"My type of dysphoria is the type where you look into the mirror and you go ""not me"". I also get that over my birth name... so when I have to deal with my birth name my brain goes ""not me... wait... supposed to be me, aimed at me, but not me"" then disassociates heavily for awhile till I get back to normal. Binding and packing makes my body feel like mine. Not wearing one of those makes my body feel wrong and like something is missing (or something extra is present obviously). Although I do have times where I can ignore that my body is wrong. I've even found ways to make it easier to not feel that dysphoria constantly (although its not perfect, it makes it at least enough that I'm not desperately bothered). 
I like your descriptions.  The first is what I initially felt and over the list couple months as I've been figuring things out I've moved to the ""itchy"" you describe.  My long shorts that hide my legs until below the knee so longer feel comfortable.  Changing out of leggings, bra and top into jeans because I might have company show up this morning was a disappointment, as if I had to go to an event I had no interest in attending.  I'm pre-HRT btw as well.
When I have to present female, I definitely get that itchy feeling, and I'd also describe it as cold. It reminds me of being insecure in a revealing bathing suit. Plus when I look in the mirror and notice non-masculine traits it's like I'm looking at someone else or a mannequin so that's uncomfortable. It's hard for me to separate dysphoria from other negative emotions though so idk what I can attribute to my trans-ness and what I can't
I know exactly what that‚Äôs like. I never realized I was dysphoric until I realized I was trans. I do experience a bit more of the traditional dysphoria now, but I almost wish I had before; internalized dysphoria is so hard to see for what it is. 
I'm questioning, but I've definitely experienced the traditional dsyphoria. It feels like a persistent presence that's kind of weighing me down. I'm generally pretty happy so overall I seem fine, but there's a hint of unease/tension  that exists. This is counteracted by euphoria, which I experience more often. That's more of like a realization or excitement when I'm doing something like painting my nails or singing awfully. I'll often see or do something and latch onto it.

I think I've started experiencing the mild type of dysphoria. This type scares me because it's more active than the traditional type for me and I think it hits me particularly hard I'm tired and not as busy with work. It's hard to ignore to, hence why I've had to start buying stuff to keep it at bay.
For me it feels like a neverending series of distractions. I can't pass a mirror without checking to see whether I look male or female. When I'm preparing to leave the house, every time I'll tell myself ""just wear jeans and a tshirt this time, you're just going to the store"" but will end up (an hour and three costume changes later) trying to put on decent makeup. I sigh and feel dull when I take my earrings out to go into a gas station. By the time I get home I've barely put down my keys and said hi to the cats before I've changed into more feminine clothes, which I then spend the rest of the day picking at and examining. All of my free time is spent reading and watching and listening to trans resources. I can barely get any work done and my social life has almost disappeared.

Dysphoria is worry and exhaustion and the fear that I'm crazy for feeling it at all. I'm so tired of it all. It feels like an addiction - like wanting to focus on something else, but just *needing* that cup of coffee. Because it's so similar, I'm often paranoid that I'm conjuring the whole thing just to give my mind something to pick at all the time.


You aren't conjuring it.  You're a woman, and our sister.  I'm just sorry you worry so much, love."	7kwww3	trans	11	0.84	2017-12-19 22:42:35
My boyfriend told his parents I'm trans. Went horribly.	"Hey guys, new to reddit but decided to make one since I'm really desperate for advice here. So I'm a trans guy (FTM) and I've been dating this other guy (cis) for three years. Our relationship is great. We're long distance but are usually able to visit each other a few times a year, but (since he lives in an area and family where being trans isn't well received), nobody apart from his closest friends knew he had a partner-- let alone a boyfriend.  


I've talked to him about coming out to his parents, as most of the time, they fly out with him when he visits since he still lives with them. They're pretty conservative when it comes to gender roles and every time I go to his place I get comments about how I should grow my hair out, wear girls' clothes, how I'd look so much prettier if I just wore makeup, etc., which is EXTREMELY foreign and uncomfortable to me as I mostly pass at home and am fully out here. He's told me before that he thinks they'd be fine with it, but that he's really nervous about them finding out and how they'd view him.  
Fast forward to today. He told me he wanted to tell his parents. I told him not to jump the gun and to think about it more, in case something bad happened. But, worst case scenario (I know his parents pretty well and his mom is a clinical psychologist, so I assumed she'd be a BIT understanding), I thought that they'd just not let me fly over there as often-- if they reacted badly at all.  


I was very wrong.  


They took everything from him and forced him to cut all contact with me. He's nearly an adult, but won't be for another few months, and his parents have a history of keeping every little rule and regulation for their kids in place from the moment they're able to walk 'til they turn 18. I didn't expect this to happen (I would've never even mentioned telling them if I did), but now I've lost him. He's my best friend and like my other half at this point, and being without him all of a sudden with no timeframe other than ""until I move out"" is killing me. I currently have no form of contact with him, other than a google doc I shared with him, but since he's probably worried they'll find out, I don't think he'll use it.  


Any advice is appreciated, please. I have no clue what to do. I love him more than anything and the guilt and anger and frustration is eating me up. I just wanna talk to him again.  


Also note: His parents liked me a lot before this went down and we haven't spoken at all about this yet. They're not the stereotypical transphobes/homophobes whatsoever, which is why I'm just so shocked they weren't okay with it."	"I don't know what you should do, but you have -5 karma over a opinion post, so heres an upvote
Hey dude, I'm so sorry this is happening to you. Nobody deserves that.

Really the only thing I can maybe think of doing is calling his parents directly and explaining it yourself? At least hear their rationale so you can try to have a conversation with them about why they're doing this. Try and talk to them about why they're doing this and reason with them, show them your point of view and present your case in a nonaccusatory way. You could possibly ask your boyfriend in the google doc how they're acting and what they're doing to try and gauge where they're at before you call. If it fails, then you're no worse off than you were before.

I know, it sounds like a terrifying, uncomfortable prospect. If you're worried it may put either of you in danger, then I'd definitely recommend not doing it. If not, then at this point I'm not sure what you have to lose by calling and trying to talk things out.

Whether you decide to call or not, good luck man. I hope everything turns out okay for you.

My trans cousin	"Ok so, i have a trans girl cousin. Im really happy for her because she has officially come out with her name and pronouns AND the name she chose is the official one she has in school as well! The thing is, my brother. he is 17 and really doesn't understand trans, what it means to be trans or the fact that nothing has ""caused"" it in the way mental illnesses are caused. He says things like ""h e must've gone through something to become like this"", ""i feel like h e is only doing it because of anxiety"" or ""how can h e know when h e is so young (also 17)?"". At first it angered and frustrated me because i saw it as transphobia, being the only LGBT+ in my family who actually understands and can defend her,, but the more he speaks about it, i realize its just ignorance and concern. He himself is a cishet white so he really doesn't face issues caused by things that are unchangeable. He is concerned because he hears these stories about people who have transitioned and then detransitioned, but at the same time its none of his business anyway. 

This saturday our trans cousin and her family are coming over for my graduation, and all i want is to make her feel accepted and comfortable. Advice?"	"You're already doing well by using her correct pronouns. If you think your brother is coming from a place of concern Cornell university has information drawn from over 20 decades of studies including that only 0.3 percent to 3.8 percent regret transitioning. That might be a good source of information. Its called the ""what we know"" project.

Going through some tough times questioning my gender in a marriage. My wife hit me last night.	"crosspost from r/feminineboys I hope that's ok.

Things have been rough lately. I've been questioning my gender and experimenting with fem stuff for about the past 4 weeks. We're taking it one day at a time but my wife is having a hard time with my experimentation. I've been only dressing up and trying makeup when she's asleep to keep the peace but she's still been distant. Last night I was having a full on panic attack about gender stuff and she came out and asked me what was wrong - I told her she didn't want to know and she pushed so I had a conversation with her about it. She said she'd love and support me no matter what - but she can't guarantee that our relationship will stay the same. But then she went inside and drank a whole bottle of wine. I drank a bunch of whiskey we yelled and cried and said terrible shit to each other and I went to a separate room to just lie on the floor and get away from her.

She came in and kicked me and continued the argument. In the leg, and not that hard or anything, but definitely in anger. I've never hit her before and wouldn't dream of it. Then this morning she told me she was pissed she couldn't find my phone because she wanted to read my message history with my trans friend who is the only person I've been able to talk to. I just can't process it, I never would have imagined, but she hit me she tried to invade my privacy.

I don't know what to do. I'm scared. And I think my marriage to the woman I still want to spend the rest of my life with might be ending.

She hit me... I just can't get it out of my head."	"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that. It can be difficult to process something like that, but it sounds like you‚Äôre experiencing physical abuse (and possibly emotional or verbal abuse) from her. The trans lifeline can help if you need anything about your gender or are having issues coping with that (+18775658860 is their number). And I‚Äôm sure they can help or refer you to somewhere that can help get you out of physical danger.

Realizing your gender or even experimenting can put a strain on a relationship. But it‚Äôs important to remember that no matter your gender that you don‚Äôt deserve to be hurt like that üíï
That‚Äôs a divorce right there. She‚Äôs clearly abusive
Thank you so much. I didn‚Äôt know about the lifeline - I think I‚Äôm ok now but really could have used it yesterday.
I don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs the first time and we‚Äôve been together for 15 years and it wasn‚Äôt super hard or anything so I just feel like I‚Äôm whining. I just told her that it‚Äôs bothering me more than she thinks it is and that shit is unacceptable in the future. Divorce is scary as hell.
Edit- she is bi but has told me that she‚Äôs only really into masculine women though. I wonder if the change in perceiving me as more feminine has also made me an easier target for anger and abuse."	ip22i9	trans	13	0.82	2020-09-08 20:59:47
Crying, with no one else to talk to.	"Context:
     I have been verbally abused as far as can remember. My family would make fun of each other to bond. I was too nice to say bad things, but they wouldn't let up until I started crying. They said they were only joking, but they always eventually made fun of me again. I told them I didn't like it, but they never stopped. They only place I felt safe was at my grandparents house, but we moved away from them.

     Im AMAB, and I grew up in the early 2000's born right after the Millennial cut off. When I grew up the only thing close to trans representation, was guys wearing women's clothing as the punch line. It was on all the kids show networks. When I got older it was adult shows making fun of trans women, by having it being the most masculine man in a dress with lipstick. 

     In school I was the outcast my father was military and we moved every few years. I didn't know how to make friends. I was different because I was an EGG, and I did not know everyone since preschool like they did. I was the most comfortable talking to girls, I was raised by my mom and sister since my dad was never around. They didn't want to be friends. the ones that I did have never included me in conversations.

     I was so tired of being different, I wanted friends. I hated going home because  my sister and I were physically abused and severely neglected by my mom, who had severe anger issues. I wanted nothing more then to have a safe space, so thought having friends would give me one.

     I tried to be as ""manly"" as possible so that I could have guy friends. I rejected all the ""girly"" things I liked, witch was a lot. I wanted friends and in a lesbian, so I thought it would help me get a girlfriend. I didn't get guy friends till highschool when I started being more myself, witch is hilarious in hindsight. It wasn't until I was 23 that I accepted the girly sides of myself, looked up Transgender, and realized I was a trans woman.

Why I'm Crying:
     I've been out as trans for half a year, but I have been out as not cisgender for over a year. Last night was the first time I have seen my grandparents since I came out. Thankfully I was able to invite my extremely supportive best friends. My grandparents, aunts, uncles, and their family's have always been super close. They were all there since it was a family event.

     My family also happens to be Christians, but are vary accepting. when I got there though no one used my ""true name"", or any name for that matter. The pronouns they used for me were all male. They ignored it, and I felt like an outsider in the one place that brought me the most comfort. The place I felt safe because no one would beat or make fun of me. It was like they couldn't recognize me. They only comfort was my best friend's. They called she and used my ""true name"" all night.

     I feel guilty for being sad. I know people have been kicked out of their homes for being trans. I just can't stop crying, because I want to have one day were I can be a normal girl. Every mirror and picture of me is my mortal enemy. I even went to a pride festival and got missgendered, while I was warring a trans flag hat, pronoun pin, and a trans flag as a cape. I have never once felt like I could feel safe and happy being myself. My friends try to understand, but they don't understand why the little things hurt soooo much. 

     I'm sorry for the long post (if anyone even got this far). I thought that mabey if I posted on here, this could be the one place where my feelings would be normal."	"I‚Äôm sending you a hug ‚ù§Ô∏è

My family and my in laws are Mormons. They try but they don‚Äôt get it.

My mum was extremely abusive and blames the fact I‚Äôm trans on my dad, The parent who raised me. 

I‚Äôm very alone too and strangers and my family and in laws always misgender me.

I even get mistaken for female by other trans people. Pride was a day were I got mistaken for either a trans woman or a lesbian (I‚Äôm a gay trans man)
Since you are willingly to share your story, allow me to share you mine. 
All my life, I always been different. From the very beginning, I was against being a ""male"". Idk why or how but I refused to participate in many activities that is considered male. I grew up with a doll, rocking chair, and a heart of confusion. My mom got mad at me when I first dressed myself using her clothes and put on make-up. From the age of 4, I was already different on the outside by being deaf. I hated myself for not fitting in. I didn't want to hear about sports, cars, or exercise tips. I wanted gossips, talk about clothes, and sewing ideas. I hated the fact that even girls didn't want me as friends due to my strangeness. I was alone. I stole several article of clothing from my mom and never got caught after the first time. Once the ""time of normal"" ended with the betrayal of my father, everything went down to a darker path, self guilt into the bottom of a river. That is when I needed to better myself somehow. The additional problem also was my mother broke my trust using therapists. Mimic like a parrot was the phrase I would say when my mom wanted to talk to me about certain things. My brother went down d and s path. I couldn't help him and I hated myself for that. He is still struggling to get rid of addiction of drugs. Nothing illegal but still, he is still struggling. I struggled in life with a heavy heart of knowing I will never feel like I belong. Life continues until March of this year. I went into a severe anxiety/depression episode to the point I almost broke two promises I made to myself to never do. I discovered many things since then. This year, three month ago, I found myself in a way I feel free. The one thing that really prevent me to trust again is my ability to see the person for who they are, behind the mask they wear. I can see the 50 masks that everyone sees and have the instinct of know who I can trust in long term versus short term. The shadow on their back is another thing I can see. My great grandma was the one person who I could talk to and would listen. She died before all the dark time hit and everyone on my grandma side of the family basically disowned me and my family. I couldn't even trust my grandma due to my ability to see.
By accepting the past to embrace the future, i start to understand my selfish desire in a way never before."	vkdq4v	trans	12	0.93	2022-06-25 12:10:41
Emotional changes after starting HRT?	How is that possible? Thats really odd. I used to keep my emotions for myself and not express them (aside from anger I guess). But after starting HRT 6 months ago I've been more and more emotional; I didnt know I could cry listening to music! I always thought that people were pretending to when they did, but its actually a thing! how is it that i get more emotional?	"im not trans and so i obviously dont do hrt but arent emotional changes the main side effects of hrt
Hiding and repressing your feelings is one of the #1 symptoms of depression. You're accepting yourself and learning how to be yourself, of course you're becoming less depressed.
[deleted]
Might also be that as you are accepting and moving towards the person you want to be, some of those emotional walls are dropping. All wonderful things :)
I think it's in large part due to emotional repression ending - it's easy to take for granted how repressed our emotions get being trans, but as - at least myself - begins to transition, all that sort of starts to unravel and we begin to feel more in our own bodies. That's at least my own take on it.
Our emotions are largely chemical in nature so changing your hormonal balance, all by itself, will make a difference. But what everyone else in this thread is valid too. Wait til you start getting maternal feelings upon seeing a baby‚Ä¶ that freaked me out a bit.
Before I started hrt I guess I was numb to it all. Something tragic could happen and I'd feel like some sort of monster for not at least being able to show some empathy. Hrt changes that drastically imo. I've loved my journey for over 8 years but it's been an emotional ride for sure. Hang on in there lol. Also hrt changes your brain over time physically.
Im kinda scared will that happen to me?
I can't feel shit, I can only get depressed and anxious
Mental changes yes, and they are often the first changes people notice :) 

Some of it is is not because of HRT but the simple fact that you get to start HRT can make people feel better. I noticed my dysphoria went down quite a lot and I was actually comfortable looking at myself in a mirror. The next mental change was feeling more emotion and it was really easy for me to cry or want to cry
My wife used to say I was a sociopath! And also said I faked emotions as well, which was true, btw."	rfqbpk	trans	10	1.0	2021-12-13 21:14:23
Estrogen and clarity.	"
This has been a really hard month for me. I am mourning a dear friend who was one of the first I came out to. His acceptance and support set the tone of my journey and gave me alot of momentum. I will never forget him.

On top of that.  I am losing income. I'm in danger of being homeless.  I even had heat exhaustion and nearly was hospitalized due to a broken air conditioner.

However it is also the month I started estrogen and progesterone injections with Spiro taken orally 

I did my second round of injections earlier today. So thats only 10 days of hormones and I already can tell you. I feel better. 

It isn't a magical cure. Im not suddenly just happy. In fact I am honestly very sad and in alot of emotional pain, BUT...

I just feel better. Or rather. I feel, better. 

I used to feel this heavy fog of just general depression that would manifest itself in anger. 

Today the fog is more like a swarm of insects but I can clearly see the rotting fruit that is attracting them.

Weird analogy I know. 

What I am trying to say is. 

I think I finally feel hopeful, because I'm starting to feel like myself"		oudd6p	trans	12	1.0	2021-07-30 04:05:33
I assume this is what mood swings are?	"My estrogen dose was doubled at the beginning of this week which was cool. But it has been an awful week in the UK for trans people and I've been in a bit of a funk all week. 
Last day or so though; Does wanting to scream in anger at the world from the roof one minute and wanting to cry in a pit of despair the next sound about right for a mood swing?"	"honestly yeah, sometimes your body wants to let off many emotions at once
oh yes. I hear many say this. I just got mine increased and I got completely bitchy and achy. PMS!! Lasted about 5 days. And they say it can be monthly. Oh God.
Ex estrogen producer here. I feel like my mood is more stable generally since I started T, so I wouldn't be surprised if E effects you the other way around. Before HRT I usualy had messy days, especially shortly before my period started. But it's something you can get used to, if it becomes regular for you. (Maybe consider keeping track, if you notice it happens again?) 

But looking at the situation and all the horrible shit that happens around the globe; I wouldn't exactly judge anybody for feeling anger, anxiety, despair or anything else. It's a lot to handle. 

Take your time and don't be to harsh on yourself.

Kinda funny but not. I‚Äôm dealing with the same this week and my dose was also increased to where it‚Äôs now wtf at times. Not gonna lie, I like it..
Thanks, it feels like it...
I assume it's just best I drown myself in comfort food and films?

I just wanted to say that you all are beautiful!	"I am a bi-women in a happy heterosexual relationship. I've gone throug some gender confliction in my youth, but never in such a way that it hurt me. I've never expirienced hatred or banter from anyone becuse of my gender or sexual prefrence, and it makes me SO mad.
Not becuse I want people to treat me badly, but because I onestly don't see the difference in being gay, gender conflicted, or being trans. (I know it's not the same!) We are all just people who are brave or sure enough to want to be our self! And why should it be okey for me to be bisexual? Okey for me, as a born woman, to talk about my gender confliction and gender roles, but when trans-people try talk about how they feel, or beeing gay and trans at the same time (or anything really), they get banterd, beaten, misbelived and hushed! It angers me and saddens me. I can't even begin to imagine what some of you are going throug, and I think you all are so very very brave! 

With love I want to thank you all, and tell you that I really admire you, and that I am so proud of the beauty and bravery you all bring to this world every day. ‚ù§

The Girl under the bridge : i need more answers	"[TW : Suicide mentions, Mental illness]


This is a throwaway account I created around a year ago for the purpose of this question. I'm much more active into other social medias. You may notice that I can have difficulties with English (or just at speaking in general), that's because I'm a non english-speaking lass, and I cannot reveal my country, fearing that my family could track me down. 
I want to share a story that happened in my childhood that raise important questions to me, and everywhere I go, I find no answers. I asked some friends, I tried to go forward people having the same disorders as me...no answers anywhere. Neither from doctors, neither family, no one. 

(A detail that might be important before starting the storytelling : I am an autistic ""Asperger"" / I hate that term/ person, and I found out being a transgender woman some years ago. I still can't start my medical transition due to family pressure and threats, this is why I hide myself from them by not using my real internet username.
Another detail that might be important for readers : my story include parts about depression and suicide. If you are sensitive to these, I recommend you to not read.)


In May 2012, I was 13, and I were, as I oftenly did, at my grandma's house. Try to figure this to yourself : this day was the shittiest you could imagine for a person like me.  In a period where I wasn't able to have a good social contact to anyone, where I had suicidal thoughts and no self confidence, that day, everyone in my family was pissed after me. 
Litteraly everyone. Brother, Mother, stepfather, Uncle, Grandma..e-ve-ry one was pissed after me that day and would find something either to make me work, either to make myself bad. 
During the late afternoon, I cracked down and ran away from my house in order to breath. 
Around this house, there a series of road, including one with a walkable part and another one leading to a highway a few hundred meters away. I ran down the path, leading to a corn field. The road is keep going alongside the field, until you can reach a gas pipeline...and a bridge. 
On the upper bridge, all the cars goes that way. 
Under it : only a few people goes through that place, because of the rednecks and gipsies (sorry for the term, this is the only translation I found) living nearby.

I knew this place for a long time, hanging there with some cousins or friends. 
This time, I was alone, fragile, in a uncontrollable state of sadness and anger...and I well remember everything. 
I shouted, hited the wall by bumping myself into it...then I just sat there, and started to cry, talking to myself. Sayin' that I wasn't worthy of living, or even just being myself.
I looked on the ground, I saw a beer bottle, and decided to break it. I think you know what's coming. 
A miracle to myself that the glass projectiles hadn't made me blind. I broke the bottle, and in my hand lefted just enough glass to cute a lethal wound for a child. 
I hesitated. A long time. Then I started crying on my knees with the bottle near me, laying on the ground. 
I couldn't see anything, but I cried a lot, and could feel my tears dropping on my jeans. 
Then something quite unexpected happened. 
I heard heavy footsteps, fasts footsteps, running toward me. I was too moved inside to react to anything, my brain was focusing on my sadness, which seems to be a kind of reflex for children. 
I was waiting for the runner to stab me or something.........

Then I felt that person hugging me. 
Like strongly, passionately. That person just ran up to me litteraly to hug me for a really long time. I don't know the exact length of that hug, but I guess around 15 minutes. That was at the time the longest hug someone gave me in my life. 
In the middle of it, I hugged them back, still shaking by the tears. 
After I entirely stopped crying, that person layed off me and stood up. 


This was one of the most choking moment in my entire life. 
And also the biggest mystery I face up with since merely 10 years.


Because that person was me.
Me, in a full feminine looking body. 
Everything was there. My green kaki jacket, my black t-shirt, my shoes, my jeans, my eye color, my hair color...all. That person was just litteraly me as a cisgender girl. 
(And I precise that I wasn't questioning my gender at all at the time.) 
After that, because I couldn't even have the time to at least say ""thank you"" or ""why"" or even ""what's you're name ?"", that girl ran away. 
Even tho I wouldn't had the strength to run after her, I just stopped everything for a second to analyze what happened. Then after some minutes of rest, I walked down to my home, after an hour outside. An hour that I wasn't ready to forget. 

I thought of it really hard on the months following that event, but the more the time passes, the more life is bringing responsabilites to me, and the less I thought of it. I slowly forgot it, until 2017, where I dreamed about that situation. 
I think it's part of the reasons why I hate being seen as a man at the moment, but then I realized that that questioning was much beyond that, so I took that event out of my self analysis. 

Today I'm 23, I'm a student on graphic design, and I'm still filled up with questions. 
What was that ?
Was it the most extreme coincidence you can find on earth ? Did my brain created this ? And if it is, how could she had hugged me ? 
I know very well since my childhood that I also have dissociative identity disorders, with someone living in my head. My point is : I can fully make the difference between a sensation that an hallucination or just my brain is trying to create, and something that I FEEL on my body. Touching something and feeling the pressure of someone hugging you isn't something your brain can create. Unless your brain knows how to squeeze your entire body. 
Even then, if that person was real, why did she ran away ?  

With all that, I just want to know if some people can help me with this. Did some people here had faced up similarly encounters ? Can some people have an explanation a little more pushed that ""it's you're brain"" or ""you're crazy"" ? 
Because everytime I'm talking about this to some friends, no one could find any answers, and some agressive people just told me that I have to find a doctor and go away from them. 
I'm not trolling, I'm not making anything up, I can swear on everything that I love that I just need answers. Nowhere on my close circles of friends or families I could find answers..

I'll be updating, and probably responding to some people who'll post in this, I'll be reading everything. 

Thanks for reading everything, and thanks if you are a giving me answers. 
Have a great day/night everyone, and take care of yourself in those hard times.

Post Speculos : after i droped that question on offmychest merely a year ago,  a person told me that I glitched the matrix, and saw the woman I will be. I found it cute and funny heh.
Some other people explained this by psychosis and other things, and as I accept this as an answer, I want to know if there is anyone on earth who experienced the same things.
I posted this on some other sub reddits today, and I'm starting to have a lot of advices, but as ANY question, wether it's science, philosophy, self analysis, or even cooking : you can't just go with 5-6 people giving you an advice or a possible answer to your problem."	"Step 1: Transition

I have worked in mental health for over 3 years now, the start of I'm sure a long career. When talking to patient's I never call them crazy, and I do not think you are crazy either. If it was a hallucination it sounds like a tactile and visual hallucination. The brain can create the feeling that something or someone is touching you, when nothing may be touching you. On the flip side, it could have just been someone who seen you were in a dark state of mind, and wanted to help out by showing that someone does care. I know it may not be the answer your looking for, but regardless, I hope it helps clear it up a little. Below are links to information which contain a little more information.

I'd also say that your brain created it for you. I think I met my cis girl me in a dream few times, long before I questioned myself. One encounter was so intense, it left me changed, I tried searching of the meaning of it for so long, now, in the hindsight, I think that was just true me. Me, that I can finally love.

I got the trans bullied out of me at 6 and now I don‚Äôt know who I am	"When I was a kid I knew exactly who I was. I was a girl, there must have been some mistake because I didn‚Äôt feel right in a boy‚Äôs body... when it was dress up time at nursery I chose to wear a dress (and got mocked for it through primary school until I was 12). But I loved it, I could just be me and wear what I want.

I didn‚Äôt care what other kids thought one bit. But my parents made it clear I couldn‚Äôt do that. I don‚Äôt remember how open I was with them... I definitely tried on my mum‚Äôs makeup and heels, which she sternly disapproved of. I wanted to play with dolls, which was strictly forbidden and they made me play with ‚Äúboys toys‚Äù. But when I was 6 and first had access to a computer, I made some... interesting searches for a 6 year old to be making, basically asking if it‚Äôs possible to change gender (in whatever 6 year old terms I came up with). I still remember the anger on my parents faces when we got home and they sat me down and grilled me on whether I made those searches or not, and I cried and said I didn‚Äôt. I was never really the same after that. Just hearing the anger and panic in their voices at the idea that their son was actually a daughter. Along with some more trauma in the years that followed, I just wanted a quiet life so I shut up and closed myself off. As a result, I absolutely suck at describing myself because I‚Äôve suppressed any kind of personality I may have had.

Now, I have no idea what I am. I‚Äôm 20 years old now, and I‚Äôm so insecure that I don‚Äôt know anymore, I‚Äôm barely alive. Lockdown and growing my hair longer has been fun... I like it and want it longer, but I can already see the panic return when I say I like it, as if they‚Äôd been hoping I had suppressed it completely. They still occasionally mock my high voice or how I stand with my hands on my hips. I never get taken seriously. I wish I didn‚Äôt live at home so I could experiment more.

But I‚Äôll never get back to how I was then... it infuriates me. I was so sure of myself and who I was when I was fucking 3 years old, and now 17 years later I‚Äôm barely getting by. I didn‚Äôt care what my peers thought, I was just me. But my parents instilled this deeply rooted anxiety and depression and loss of identity in me... I don‚Äôt know who I am anymore. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm trans, but I know I was when I was 3. I don‚Äôt know anything anymore, in the back of my mind I still make decisions that won‚Äôt ‚Äúget me into trouble‚Äù."	"I‚Äôm sorry to hear that, honestly if you like growing your hair you do you, you‚Äôre an adult and are allowed to experiment even with gender and gender expression. I would try and find a therapist who works in the field of trans/nb etc I think that would really help you get down to these suppressed feeling if they are still there. Obviously if you are still living at home this is going to be a bit more difficult especially if your parents aren‚Äôt very open-minded but always put your own happiness first! Good luck!
What you are experiencing sounds less like not being trans and more like being scared of even letting yourself remember that because of the emotionally abusive actions of your parents.  Internal transphobia is very real and very painful, but therapy can help with that.
I have kind of a similar experience. I knew when I was 12 that I really, really wanted to be a boy. It wasn't tolerated at all, and I knew it wouldn't be so I kept very quiet. I did once say ""I think I have a boy brain"", which I meant in a very trans way. The response was better than it could have been (pity) but I also knew if I kept trying to break the rules the response was going to get worse -- parents and peers were just incidentally calling me a girl, but if they knew how much it bugged me they would start really cracking down on me.

The thing about suppression is that it feels like it works sometimes. I thought it was gone, but I just wasn't thinking ""I am a boy"" anymore -- and that's still not back in the same way as I used to think it. I wasn't thinking about my gender directly for years at a time, but I did feel like absolute shit. It was a survival technique that didn't really work.

Fast forwarding 20 years, I got to 30 and trans topics started becoming much more prominent. I accidentally ran into some trans stories when I wasn't looking for them and it was scary as hell. I remembered how strongly I felt when I was younger, and I remembered that I had gone to church books to find out what would happen to me. I realized I'd been trying to work out what I was but I didn't really think I was trans, because that had to be so much worse than what I experienced -- but I also didn't know my anxiety/depression was linked to it, and that was \*really\* bad at times. So I'd been watching trans people and felt very sorry for them, but also jealous because I didn't know what was wrong with \*me\* and they'd figured it out. And I was scared to experiment because I had a feeling I'd like it, and once I had felt whatever I thought I'd feel, I just wouldn't be able to go back to how I had been -- which turned out to be right, but I also felt so much better that I don't regret it.

Be prepared for a few unpleasant parts, though:

* The questioning phase feels awful. Your brain will obsess over this for months, especially as you suppressed out of fear/survival. That fear is still there and it has to be processed sometime. It got better for me, eventually, but I did have to increase my anti-anxiety meds to cope with it.
* Suppression changes how you feel things and it doesn't come back all at once. I thought I didn't have severe dysphoria but as I experimented it was like some kind of heavy weight was taken off me but I didn't know I was carrying it at all!
* Huge sense of regret because I made the wrong decision to suppress -- it was probably the right decision, though, since I had no other option. I made it when I was really young, I could not have possibly known better, but it did screw up my life and I'm dealing with all of the consequences now.
* Staying in the closet isn't fun. As soon as I figured out what was wrong, my dysphoria became so much more intense, because now I knew what was going on. Being called the wrong gender was much more painful.

I don't want to scare you off, but if you know that it isn't fun but you get through it, it's better than sitting in those unpleasant places and feeling like it's just never going to end.
Oh, girl, I‚Äôm so sorry they did that to you. They just didn‚Äôt understand.
Similar happened to me. I showed signs but just shoved it down and it took years for me to figure out what was actually going on. The upside is now as adults there‚Äôs a chance to do something about it. If you‚Äôre still closeted, even knowing it and making a plan is better than staying stuck and doing nothing."	lvn13h	trans	10	0.85	2021-03-01 22:49:49
I wish I could be masculine enough‚Ä¶	It feels so hopeless, every time I think I‚Äôm passing well I still get misgendered. My mom won‚Äôt let me get an ‚Äúugly‚Äù haircut or clothes (basically anything masculine) so I‚Äôm stuck looking like a fucking butch lesbian. I‚Äôm so tired of asking where the restroom is and being led to the lady‚Äôs room, not being treated like one of the boys in my friend group, being called ‚Äúmiss‚Äù and ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù and ‚Äúyoung lady‚Äù, just being misgendered in general‚Ä¶ I feel like I‚Äôll never pass‚Ä¶I wish my parents tried for another boy instead of a girl so I wouldn‚Äôt be stuck being so damn feminine. I‚Äôm 16 and all the dudes my age are growing facial hair, and GOD I want some of my own. I can‚Äôt fake one with makeup because I hate makeup and I suck at it, plus my mom wouldn‚Äôt allow it. Nothing I do is ever masculine enough. It makes me wanna cry, but that‚Äôll just make me look more feminine cause god forbid boys express their negative emotions as sadness instead of anger.

I need to vent about harassment and...I need support	"Today I seized the courage to wear exactly what I wanted to work. Normally, if I wear something like a skirt, I change into when I get to work, but today I said to hell with it. And work was good! Yay! (One little girl asked why I was wearing heels--they we're flats, but not the point--and I just told her that anyone can wear whatever makes them comfortable. And her mom just stood there smiling and agreeing.)

And then everything just went to sh*t.

I got to the bus stop to go home, and some guy who was probably drunk or drugged-out started harassing me. He went from ""that skirt would look way better if it was shorter"" to ""what's under the dress honey"" to ""show us your [chest]!"" He even got up into my face and faked physically assaulting me.

I endured his crap for an hour before I realized that there were no more buses due to the holiday, so I had to call an Uber. I got home around 9:30; it's been four hours and I'm still shaking and upset, although the crying has finally stopped. A friend of mine says the number feeling will come next and then the anger--but I do not want the anger. I just don't want to feel anything.

This is new territory for me. I don't know what to do with everything in my head. I wish I could forget all about it, but it's stuck there.

Just...help? Please?"	"Hey there, my name‚Äôs Rowan (she/her). I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that you had to go through that and it sounds like there‚Äôs still a lot to process. I‚Äôd be happy to chat with you, if you‚Äôd like a friendly ear. Feel free to shoot me a DM, if you‚Äôre comfortable with it.
It's likely it went just bad timing for you. As you cannot really avoid such situations, you can learn to mitigate their probability of occurrence. Eyes on you but you can be on the other side of the road or at another bus stop or a few minutes earlier or later and you'd be in a different setting. Always trust your instincts. If you feel like you must move forward to the next stop, go. One important thing is that time is precious and time can work to your advantage or against you. This is why I almost never wait for the bus at the bus stop. Five minutes is all I allow myself to be there. The city is full of junkies, beggars and thieves. The longer I stand there the more I get exposed. I always keep moving and if the next stop is minutes away, I go to the next one if I have time and I never walk back to the previous one, always forward. This strategy seems to work for me and keep the probability on the low side. Also, these days a lot of buses and trains use tracking apps so you can check whether the next bus is coming soon at all. Somehow, people have 6th sense to sense if someone is feeling emotionally unstable after having a bad day and it works in cascading effect. It's when your mind focuses too much on your insecurity, the next event occurs. The time management, mind, law of attraction and instincts are powerful things beyond our own understanding. They can work in your favour or against you. I hope for your good future and all the best to you!
I can't understand the guy at the bus stop saying that crap to you.

I'm a chatty person, but NEVER get that personal. That's messed up.

I'm sorry you had to endure that, and kudos to you for putting up with it for so long. Glad you got away unscathed (physically anyway). Heal those emotional wounds, and stay strong!
I'm so sorry that that happened to you, I can't say that that's ever happened to me, and I know that it probably won‚Äôt.

Here's the upsides to this; you pass so well that idiots are willing to harass you for an Hour! Either that weirdo had some perseverance or you are incredibly good looking.

Now, here's the bad news, this isn't likely going to be a one time thing in life, some day, someone might act up again, and if you need help from situations like this again, it's much more likely that someone will help you, but if they don't, you have plenty of people here who would be willing to step in for you.
I'm so sorry this happened to you, but don't let it stop you from wearing whatever you want. People are shitty sometimes but it's important to focus on the positives that can happen, like showing that little girl that whatever makes someone happy is okay.

My DM's are always open if you need any support
Thank you for your response. I would definitely like to take you up on that offer, but I'm about to have to head into work. More than that, though, my head is still not in the best place. If you're willing, maybe I could message you later today after I get off?
Thanks. I appreciate the kind response, but I have to say that I know I definitely do not pass--I'm balding and I've got facial hair. (I'm non-binary/transfemme.) Although I can easily see things about me changing significantly very soon, at the moment I have no real desire to pass; I just want to be comfortable with myself and in what I wear. That last thing took a huge blow last night.

I have been blessed to have good friends both online and IRL, and I have nothing but support from all of them.

Thinking about‚Ä¶	"How America and our government is all like ‚ÄúYeah, you have rights to your body. You‚Äôre your own individual.‚Äù etc. But as we see with Roe v Wade, a fetus has more rights than the person who has the baby inside of them. Within all of that, it has me reflecting and asking, why do OUR bodies/lives  have zero rights?  People don‚Äôt even see as human. Since the early 1950s, we‚Äôve been told and been through so many hateful, transphobic bullshit.  It doesn‚Äôt even make sense, because as we know, Trans people always been on this damn planet. 

You know what pisses me off? 
When I see white cis heterosexual men continue to push this transphobic shit. Why did I see a 2 min video, of this dumbass arguing, talking over, and explaining what Womanhood is on Dr.Phil. How the fuck do you know what womanhood is? Do you know womanhood for Black women? For Asian women? For Latina women? No. No you fucking don‚Äôt. And the womanhood he‚Äôs talking about is the womanhood privilege? white cis women are able to enjoy. So please explain what the fuck woman hood i , Matt Welsh. I already know he doesn‚Äôt understand the vastness and beauty of womanhood (And even manhood.) Being a person/human is suppose to be different. It suppose to be beautiful. Why the fuck do people care so much about us when we don‚Äôt even bat an eye at them. We don‚Äôt even want to be acknowledge half of the time! That‚Äôs why stealth is painfully a fucking thing. We literally just want to fucking live and be happy lol.

There so much I can type but my phone is lagging and my anger is at the tops. 

God, being Trans is beautiful. It pisses me off , since i was ducking 10, how these dumb ass cis people come and decide everything. They can tell you want a human life amounts to. They can decide what can be done with your body. When at the end of day , just like any other human, we‚Äôre different, and we all experience and express our gender and personhood differently. 

To our fuck up, transphobic, hateful government: Fuck you, you can choke. and Fuck people on reddit who make post about trans people then downvote the meaningful experiences that are shared."	"Religion and patriarchy [wich comes from religion].

Everything got fucked up in Europe, with like ban on fem body representation, or killing and burning cientists and all of that. Idk how they thought that white ppl lived in north Africa, like dude, Jesus wasn't white and green/blue eyes, tf?

But as it has happened everywhere, is due to power and control, here in Mexico we have a Guadalupe, the Mexican version of Mary, wich fits the narrative of ""hey I look like you, so, you can trust me"" while in reality is ""hey she is one of yours, but she comes from where I come so now you'll listen to me"" 

If there's someone to blame, the church and white ppl, but the crazy ones. Like the nazis. Fr why they want supremacy? these fuckers go out in the sun and end up like tomatoes, damn the world is fucked up. Wanna go out for ice cream?
you‚Äôre not lying with any of that, and you‚Äôre damn right. You know what pisses me off what religion? How they did all of that just to govern power and do all their weird shit. It‚Äôs so saddening to me to learn how so many of our ancestors and past cultures embraced and celebrated masculinity, femininity, gender, expression, all of it. All of it was so beautiful in it own way, but Nooooooooo, these weird mfers want to ruin, kill, and force it on them. And that in itself just fueled our families, communities, and generation with nothing ignorance and trauma."	vhl0k7	trans	10	1.0	2022-06-21 19:12:19
wrote a letter to no one about the loss of him	"I looked in the mirror, which is something I try to avoid as much as possible, and I cried.
For years now ive brushed my teeth after showering so the steam blocks my reflection, only looked at parts when doing my makeup, I didnt even look in the mirror when trying on clothes with you. I hate the person looking back at me. Jacob shouldnt be there, why the fuck is he there?

Hes scared to leave, he has been the mask I put on everyday, the character that grew sentience. And Im terrified to let him go. He wouldve been a success story if I wasnt here.

If he were real he wouldve been a model example of success. He is sociable and charming, he wouldve been an attractive man. He couldve found a wife and had kids, had a career doing anything, because Jacob had promise. Jacob couldve mended his problems with our family. Jacob was a vow I made as a kid and I can never hope to accomplish all he couldve, if I wasnt here.

And im filled with anger, and grief, and sorrow. Im angry that I wasnt born as me, and im angry he wasnt born as him. I have to grieve the loss of his future and my everything. I just have to accept that I can never truly be me, and he can never be him. His last chapter already unfolded, and I still cant reach my type writer.

I have a genuine question. Why do so many people exclude others who have a different opinion, rather than opening discourse?	"I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of trans subs with exclude people who have different opinions than the mainstream, and instead of getting out of the echo chamber and opening themselves up to new ideas and conversations, they‚Äôll just outright ban them, bully them, and retreat into the hive mind as to not hear different perspectives? 

I understand if someone is actively being mean, calling names, sending death threats, bullying, or what have you, but sometimes people will go against the grain and want to kindly express themselves and have open discourse with others, as to see different opinions and possibly change them. But instead, they‚Äôre outcast, sent away forcefully with hurt and pain, feeling rejected, and then they‚Äôll grow anger. Why is this encouraged? If someone is being kind or genuine, they‚Äôre still treated badly?"	"This sub in particular is a safe space meant for users to be themselves without being questioned or harassed or told to not be.

So imagine trying to be yourself here and then constantly being questioned on whether you're valid. Kindly expressing that you don't think someone is valid is just sugar coated hate, we don't allow that here. There are spaces that cater to you for those purposes and if you want to talk about those opinions, you can do so there.
Can you give an example for that?"	uo907f	trans	9	0.7	2022-05-12 19:29:52

Dream made me confront my identity	"I‚Äôm a 39 yo, married bisexual male with one child, and I‚Äôve been into cross dressing as long as I can remember. At first, a lot of it was tied to sex, with the thought of me wearing sexy clothes, makeup, etc. being a huge turn on. I‚Äôve always just let that part of me be something I indulge in every couple months because I rarely get time alone due to family life, but every time I do the feelings are less about the sex and more about me feeling ‚Äúright‚Äù in skirts, heels, long hair, breasts, the whole nine yards. 

At this point I feel like I‚Äôd have to blow up my life as I know it to take any of these feelings to the next level, so I usually just try to repress that side of myself. 

Just the other night, however, I had a vivid dream of me being a woman, the kind of woman I feel like inside with a female figure, breasts, long hair, all of it, and the people around me were accepting. I never felt anything like that before. 

Then toward the end of the dream, I walked into my family‚Äôs house where there was my immediate and extended family and all my coworkers, and a wave of panic washed over me. I ran to a bathroom and started tearing off my dress and heels and the wig I was wearing and put on ugly loose jeans and a T shirt. As I was changing I was struck by another wave of emotion, this time disgust and anger that I had to go back to being a man.

I‚Äôve never been so directly confronted with these feelings. I think I‚Äôve always felt them more deeply than I let myself believe, but now I‚Äôm just depressed and I can‚Äôt shake the feeling I had when I really was that woman. I will never transition, I know that, but even writing that for the first time in my life is making me well up with tears. 

I‚Äôm not sure there‚Äôs any advice to be had here, I just had to tell someone."	"I'm just relieved this isn't about Dream, the Minecraft YouTuber.

Debating pulling a prank on my transphobic mom before possibly never speaking with her again	"I'm 24 (MtF), came out 3 months ago, and it feels like both my mom and older brother have only regressed further and further in their transphobia. My mom (61yo) is desparate to try and convince me I'm confused and that I'll regret my transition. She pulls all these manipulative tactics like trying to prop herself up as a mom and saying things like ""No one will ever love you like I do. I just want you to be happy"". She keeps deadnaming and misgendering me, even though I tell her how much it hurts me, and when I retaliated by calling her by her first name, she got extremely offended even after I explained why I did it, and it made her cry. She came at me with ""I see how much you love me now that I'm (her name)*

What broke the last straw was her sending me a Tucker Carlson detransition video later that night. I've made so many attempts to make this easier. I came out to her in person, calmly explained everything, sent her articles and helpful videos, and I even made a 50 minute long video myself, but her capacity to listen is non-existent. She asks the same questions over and over again, and keeps spouting transphobic rhetoric that I've debunked to her several times. It doesn't help that she's a far right conservative that goes to her Christian church several times a week and has ""spoken with the pastor"" about me because everyone at church saw her crying. She's playing the victim here.

It's been nothing but doubt, anger, and my mom & brother trying to guilt trip me, telling me that I'm supposed to know from childhood or I'm not like this. My brother hates my fiancee (a cis woman), and they both think she magically turned me trans (the lesbian part of my identity is especially confusing for my mom and her pea brain). They've called me selfish, saying that I killed their son/brother, my brother calling me weak minded and using the f slur and t slur casually and getting upset when I told him that I couldn't come out to them sooner because of things like that. He actually said me coming out hurt him more than his recent break-up with a girl he had been with for a little over a year. He was financially supporting me as I went through college, but decided ""I'm cutting you off because you need to grow up.""

My mom keeps asking if I've spoken with my brother, and when I say no because he hurt me, she gets upset with ME. She says that I'm the one who hurt HIM. I know 3.5 months is still relatively early, but at this point I'm ready to just give up on even trying with them. They've shown their true colors, and it's exhausting fighting to have to justify my existence. (My mom doesnt even know I'm 2.5 months on HRT, but gas been begging me not to start and saying ""don't rush into these things""). Other parts of the family are a mix of being more neutral or supportive, but on the whole, it doesn't feel like home is a place I can return to. I'd probably feel like a stranger in my own home, a weird creature that no one wants to see.

All these years I've been unable to recognize my true identity, been fed propaganda that I internalized, and in general I've been deprived of a childhood I wish I could have had. I know my mom loves me deep down, and in her heart, she is only doing what she thinks is right. You can't change 61 years of indoctrination, but it still hurts. They've both hurt me unimaginably, and they're unable to see any faults with themselves or take any accountability for what they've done. They'll always see me as the bad and ungrateful kid who lacks maturity, so I'm thinking of putting an end to the way things are.

Honestly, I probably won't do this, but a part of me really wants to prank my mom, seeing as how she keeps saying ""I keep hoping you'll tell me this was all a prank."" So I'll do just that, tell her that I've done some thinking and I realized I was wrong. Let her get a sigh of relief, let her feel like she's ""won"" and then ripping it away by telling her that I'm still trans, and if she actually wants me in her life, she has to get on my level and call me by the right name and pronouns. I then end by saying ""Also, I've been on hormones for over 2 months now, and I feel great"" and then ending things from there, never going out of my way to call her, and only accepting calls from her if she's ready to apologize and call me by my chosen name. Until then, I refuse to call her mom.

Who knows if I'll do the prank thing, I'd feel bad doing it, but I'm also so angry that it feels deserved. I'll at least for sure do the other thing and force her to respect me if she wants to continue talking to me. So that's where I'm at. As of right now, I don't have a mom, or a brother.

TL:DR
Mom is highly transphobic so I'm thinking of pranking her by convincing her I've ""changed my mind"" about transitioning and then ripping that away from her and doubling down on my identity and exclusively referring to her by legal name until she agrees to call me by my chosen name and pronouns."	"Skip the prank part but do the rest
Drop the prank. Just tell her once and for all how you feel about her and her behaviour and leave.
Sounds like you‚Äôve given more than enough energy and effort to explain your side and chances for them to come around. They may have second thoughts about it years from now, or you might never speak with them again, but you absolutely have to do what is healthiest for you and your real family. Be honest and straightforward and leave them to figure it out for themselves. Good luck, sister.
It's the phenomena of Man Bites Dog. People, like your mother, search for outliers that reinforce their narrative. They use these outliers to prop up their poorly constructed arguments. Those stories gain traction because, like a human biting a dog, they are outside the norm and sensational. If the phenomenon of detransitioning were widespread it would hardly require some right wing troll to pimp its merits.

Sorry your family is the way they are. It's disappointing that they are allowing their own insecurities to overshadow the big life changes you are going through as you embrace your authentic self. Hang in there.
This sounds like something I'd do. Which means it probably isn't a good idea.  
That said, it sounds hilarious. I'm for it!
I have some advice for you as a trans-guy who had to go no contact with my family and disappear to transition.  
**Save any money you can!!! (most important point) MONEYYYYYY!!!!!!!!**  
Have an emergency bag set-up incase you've gotta leave.  
(List of contacts, copies of birth certificate (for future transition/ disappearing yourself without families knowledge) , food, new sim card, etc.)  
Going on gel / oral pill is better than going on injections if in unsafe environments/ if you need to evacuate to safe place since you can stock up on it and don't need to refrigerate it / it's super portable in the plastic pumps it comes in.  
(just better in general considering the current global collapse of everythin around us into void )  
Find safe people if possible  
Become a university student if you can't find a job and being a uni student is good if you end up homeless (universities have a lot of amenities; showers, wifi, aircon )  
Don't fudge up like I did, I'm lucky I'm not homeless  
other than that supportive therapist is a great thing to have buuuut, only if it doesn't compromise point 1. Last year like the only person I interacted with was my therapist.
I appreciate the help, but most of this doesn't really apply to my situation. I'm 24, already graduated University, and I have a partner who recently accepted a new job. I'm in the process of looking for a new one myself and I'm moving to another city that's also far from my family. I don't plan on sharing my address with them. I'm already independent from them and can sustain myself without them if I ever needed to cut them out of my life.
I'm glad to hear that! It would suck if you were dependent"	v74bwi	trans	10	0.86	2022-06-07 18:50:00
I feel ready but also terrified üò≠	"Hi all,¬†
This is my first post ever on reddit but I need somewhere to get this off my chest and I hear this is a safe place so throw away account time.¬†

Not so short intro of myself
I am 29 going on 30 this summer and for most of my life I identified as a male. I struggled hard all my life with social aspects, depression and anxiety, feeling out of place so many times with only short feeling of belonging. I always felt like I had to put on this persona in order to belong or feel accepted and when I slipped I often found myself made fun of or reprimanded. Once I started my adult life and finished college I became very depressed and threw myself into work and my relationship with my gf and slowly isolated myself. Fast forward to 8 years later and I felt horrible and wanted all to end so badly, until my gf asked if I wanted to get some help. After thinking about it, reading old school reports and ancient psychological tests from my forgotten childhood we realized I had untreated ADHD and depression for a large portion of my life.

When I brought this up to my family doctor he almost immediately started me on vyvanse and pristiq to help with ADHD and depression. Wow let me tell you right now, I felt like a different person within a week. I felt like a brain fog was beginning to lift, I had room to think and I started remembering my childhood so vividly. Obviously I had moments like that before in my life, they felt like snaps of clarity amidst a storm, but for the first time I felt more aware of myself, more often and more capable than ever.¬†

The present is now, kinda
For the last 8 month I've been on my new meds and it's been good but now I can't stop thinking about my gender identity. It started almost one month after starting the meds I started noticing how much more feminine than other men I was how much more I leaned toward ""girl things"" for a while I fought these felling and pushed them aside thinking it was just a phase, then the quarantine and covid-19 hit my region hard I was at home and had nothing to do for 3+ months I tried everything to distract and ignore what I was feeling, drugs, alcohol, games, movie and sleep all the time non stop I wasn't sure how to deal with any of it I never had this much time on my hands and been so aware. But it kept coming back.
I was hyper aware of anything trans related seeing it on the tv hearing people talk about it and slowly started informing myself looking for experience I could relate too. That's when I felt I had broken an illusion about myself, when I heard trans people sharing their experiences and how they overcame and freed themselves I kept going back into the rabbit hole finding more and more relatable content. I cried so hard wishing I had been able to see these things in me earlier. Feeling like I missed my chance to be my true self, I kept all this to myself until my gf did a major closet clean up and threw out a bunch of clothes, I asked if I could keep some of the ones that fit me.¬†
I crossdressed in front of some one for the first time(I had worn panties and stockings once or twice before for sexy times) but this wasn't sexual just girl clothing and it felt amazing her reaction was so supportive and she proceeded to do my makeup to finish the look and lent me a wig. After I was done I couldn't even recognize myself in the mirror and I couldn't stop staring and playing with the hair ! I was stunned, I never thought I could look that girly and beautiful, I loved the long hair I always wished I had to gut to grow it but was always warned away by parents and peers. I loved it and continued to dress up every chance I got every weekend. It was all I would look forward to I couldn't wait to shave everything off my body and wear and cover myself up and feel like a girl for a few hours. I started buying stuff like crazy dresses, bras, stocking leggings, cute socks, filling a spare dresser full of new clothes (very abnormal of me I am usually a small spender and never liked shopping before) but shopping girl stuff, I was addicted every time I went anywhere I would check the girls section. This was my new normal for almost 4 month and after a few talks with the gf I realized how big of a part of me this was, it was overwhelming I was being torn between the old and safe me that had existed and kept me safe for so long and this new emerging self that felt true and right to my core. I was stuck in this loop of maybes and what if. Between the fear and the hopes I found I needed more help. I started psychotherapy with a gender specialist and I spoke so freely so honestly for the first time in my life I felt like I had a safe space to work and share my feelings it was a stunning experience hearing myself share my wants and needs with someone I had never meet before was scary but afterwards I felt so much more confident about my feeling.¬†

Now I even feel confident saying I don't want to be a man anymore. I hate it in fact. I hate being afraid to change my body to feel more comfortable and being terrified of how that my scare or anger people around me, I hate my stupid body hair that I have to shave every few day, I hate how stupid tall I am 6.3"" and my wide shoulder make it so hard to imagine my self the way I could be. I look in the mirror and sometimes I see the girl inside, other times I see the man outside. I hate having to take off my nail art before work week because I'm afraid of reactions at the workplace. But despite all this I'm still pushing myself to be more me. I have so much hope for the girl I could be but I'm so terrified of changing my life for the worse. I've shared these feelings with a small group and most have been understanding my gf is my biggest supporter but my biggest worry as well I want to be with her forever. We are so perfect for each other but I fear this may be too fast for her to handle. I know some people won't be able to understand and might take a while to come around specifically family who's known me for almost 30 years now.¬†

Sometimes it all feels like too much to handle, in those times I keep telling myself it's my life, it's my body, my choice. That there is no requirement to be a girl that I can just be the girl I want to be even if it's not what others think trans women should be like, that's their problem not mine. Easier said than done but everyday I feel closer to being able to be me. It's a hard road and I feel so lucky to have so much help along the way but I'm just as terrified as I am excited. But I know in my heart I could never go back to the old me closeted and bound by society standards of what my AGAB let's me be and not be.¬†

Anyway sorry for the rant, feels like I have to talk about it more and more. I wanna shout it on the rooftop, I can be the girl I want to be. Nuff said.¬†

TL:DR¬†
Op takes new med for adhd and depression and within half a year realizes that he might be more of a she and is starting to accept it and wants to start transitioning but is afraid of others reacting badly and losing the few people she has left in her life.¬†"	"I feel like I'm currently about a third of the way through your emotional journey, and your story gives me hope. I for one really appreciate you sharing this, it's resonated pretty deeply! I hope you continue to find love, peace, and self fulfilment!
I feel like your gf will definitely support you if you come out. Coming out probably won't be easy, but if being a girl feels right to you, then that's definitely the right course of action. Don't worry about pushing this new information in your gf suddenly, especially since this has been a thing you've done consistently during weekends for the past 8 months, she probably already has an idea of what you're going through. I wish you the best of luck on your journey!
So now that the brain fog has lifted you realize you are trans. What are you going to do with that. you are who you are. Most young people are understanding of the trans community, so you are lucky there. Be happy you have realized who you want to be and live your life for you.
Thanks! it feel so good to talk about it, when I first began questioning my gender I was so scared I would be more alone then ever but sharing with the people in my life and I've had amazing luck with being accepted by the few people I've talked to even tho all I said was I was questioning my gender and they my see some change as I try to find my self most have been so supportive! I hope you find the same.
We talk about it so often our relationship is built on communication
But she has he own stuff that makes her life harder and she doesn't deal well stress.
For now I feel ready to come out at least to my self and closes people who have been supportive thus far, I'm still trying to nail down a name but it's so hard (>_<) but since my gf been using more feminine nicknames and treating me less like a man I've felt so free and it gives me such butterflies in my stomach every time. I feel like I've never been so hopeful for the future."	n4xx2x	trans	9	1.0	2021-05-04 20:51:54
A confession to help me come to terms with my parents' actions.	"Hi reddit...
This is going to be a long one and soemthing you may not want to read if you're easily angered... 

I am currently 16 years old and have known about my gender identity for around 4 years now. I told my parents after one year of knowing about who I am and experimenting to make sure I wasn't just a cross-dresser and was, in fact, transgender.
This didn't go well... 

Coming out:
So, the way I came out to my parents wasn't the best and (if I could) I would have 100% done it another way.
I sent my parents a long text explaining how I felt, what I believed, my experimentation of trying female outfitting and spending days with my hair in generally femenine styles (my hair has always been at a shoulder length) and my hope they would accept me.
I sent this text right before leaving for school, turning my phone off and not turning it on until I was on the bus on my way home.
again, not an amazing way of telling them but it was the best way i could do it without breaking down. 

I got on the bus and went through my day at school; I got onto the bus, ready to go home - completely forgot about telling my parents. I turned on my phone to listen to some music.
8 total missed calls and 17 unread messages.
My dad sent most of the messages, asking me why i wasn't responding and that my mum was very upset.
only 2 messages from my mum
""Are you being serious?""
""Please answer me."" 

That had me shaking (and I'm shaking now typing this) because alongside the long text message, I sent a picture of me in a skirt, knee high socks and a button up shirt tied into a semi-crop top


Confrontation:
(possible trigger warning) 

When I got home, my dad was in the hallway. He looked at me disappointed and then walked toward the kitchen; I tried to walk into the living room to see my mum but he stopped me and told me to go to my room.
I went into my room and waited for around 5 minutes before my dad came into the room, told my little brother to leave and closed the door.
He sat me down and talked to me for, what I remember and what felt like, around 3 hours about how I was wrong to tell them that way and that I was wrong about how I felt.
I was told I wasn't transgender and that it was just a phase that would simmer down after about a month or so...
I was then told (and this was the majority of the conversation) about how ""brutal"" trans surgery would be, how my family would be torn about the situation and how I should not go to drastic conclusions at such a young age. 

In fairness to them, i was only 13 years old and hadn't been exposed to LGBTQ+ until about a year prior...
I felt crushed 

Current events:
It has been 3 years since this, I am now 16, turning 17 in a few months, and still worry about telling my parents...
I dream about them knowing and the idea of being able to wear skirts and bras, taking oestrogen and going to classes to train my voice and waist!
But they always call me their son, their first born son and a 'handsome lad'
all don't sound bad but they always emphasise the male parts of these compliments. They act as though the long conversation never happened and that I have never thought about, or come to terms with, what they've said...


This post was mostly just to help me come to grips with who I am and hopefully maybe gain the confidence to tell my parents someday...
Thank you for reading this far if you did. 

So, to finish this.
I am a MTF girl. I am trans.
I shouldn't be ashamed.."	"I hope they come to terms with this soon, hopefully they‚Äôll be able to have a more reasonable and rational conversation now that you‚Äôre a little older. If not, well‚Ä¶ there‚Äôs always tomorrow. 

Plus you‚Äôll be 18 before you know it, and then you can do what you want :)
Things will get better.


On a slightly different note, you write with good prose, I really like your writing style!
Thank you!
The plan I have right now is to wait until I'm 18 or 21 and have a job set up so that I'll have my own income, ready for a worse case scenario.
I'll tell them then.

And thanks! I don't write much but this meant alot to me because I haven't ever really been 'out' before. Close friends of mine know (they are where I get some of the things I have currently (a bra and skirt)) but other than them, this is the first time I've come out properly on social media.
I would maybe also recommend looking into a weekend job; it will be hard to save money if you haven‚Äôt before, but all I can say is save save save. If you need to get out quickly, you‚Äôll benefit from having a bit of money to fall back on. 

I hope you get nothing but good responses! You‚Äôve got this ü§ó"	pmqudm	trans	9	0.91	2021-09-12 11:13:24
friends...	"So I was playing with one of my long time friends on Xbox and everything was super fine, until he invited some weirdo he said was ""chill"" and I thought I could cope with this random person until, said person, invited another friend. At first it made me mad he was calling me ""this other guy"" as if I wasn't listening or something, but then, then they all fucked up (am I even able to swear here?) So my friend invited one of our friends and all good until one of the random guys asks her ""are you a tra**y"" and everyone started talking about transgender people calling them tra**ys. It made me mad because they were using that slur like it was nothing and my friend knows I'm somewhat of an ally (I'm not out to them) and she was completely okay with that like damn.

Is it wrong I got mad? I needed to vent all the anger, but now I don't know if it was okay to be mad about that :("	Yeah id be mad too. Its like wtf? I think as certain groups of people get together their intelligence goes down.	tfa9lg	trans	8	0.91	2022-03-16 05:30:25
Vent - misgendered by another trans family member	"My wife (cis F) and I (MtF) just got into a big argument with our daughter (MtF), and in the course of it she kept trying to keep me out of the discussion so it wouldn't be two vs one. Plus she hasn't accepted me as a step-parent and so tries to keep me away from all rules discussions, but hey, I live here too. At one point I sat down around a corner (not being sneaky - we were all walking around at times) and, thinking I'd left, she said, ""are they gone?""

I go by ""she/her"", and she very well knows this. Anyway, I read her the riot act on that because she had earlier been complaining of not being treated with respect, so it momentarily felt good having the moral high ground, but she claimed it was accidental even though she didn't apologize or correct herself, and even though she's like half my age and barely an adult, it hurts and confuses me. Especially since she has in the past questioned my validity as trans and my ""dedication"" to my gender identity.

She thinks that the only way to pass is to be very underweight, and doesn't believe me that I find the opposite to be true, and so am not very motivated to lose weight, though I could stand to lose a few pounds, because hey, it gives me a softer face and slight boobs. But I'm certainly worried for her, since she seems to be hiding anorexia behind gender affirmation.

Anyway, not really looking for answers so much as just venting but I'd appreciate any stories, advice, commiseration, or whatever. Just feeling kind of ""they"" today and it hurts because that's not how I identify. Arguments make me dysphoric anyway because when I get mad my voice drops and I become very masculine. Hoping some day I'll figure out how to express anger in a both healthier and more gender-affirming way."	"You have the right to vent. Have you thought of doing a few therapy seasons together to get the message across. Mutual respect is needed here, you are a parent set rules and boundaries. I am sorry this happened i know it's painful. But think about it. It just might be the answer for your family.
Oooooooof. Yikes. Kids are hard. Hang in there, yeah?
Thank you. We tried in the past but the therapist wasn't very good and the daughter was pretty resistant. It might go better if we tried again.
Thanks! Yeah, she's a hard one. Always interesting though. Very smart and creative, just kind of hard on the blood pressure.
Try again and if she agrees to hormones great. If she does not agree and is firm about it you need to walk AWAY.
She's on hormones already. I'm not yet though, so that may help me down the road. But yeah, talk therapy may help. Thank you."	n5qsn2	trans	8	1.0	2021-05-05 21:14:59
Am I trans or is it a fetish?	"As far as I can go back in my memory as a kid I spent every night laying in bed day dreaming before and after I fell asleep that I would be turned in a girl and could do girly things and wear pretty girl clothes like disney princess dresses. I did it in a werid way though. The adults in my life, the media, and my peers raised me in the thought that boys or strong and manly while girls are weak and stupid so even as a kid I had toxic masculinity like I can't be like this and I have to be better than girls. I pretend liked I didn't like thinking about getting to wear all sorts of different girly oufits, getting long girly hair styles, and getting to do stereotypical female things with girls but in reality I the thought of these things made me so happy. I was in denial to the point that it took me 8 years until I admitted I didn't hate it because I wanted to hate it so bad but the thought of being a girl in a beautiful dress mad me so happy I couldn't stop thinking about it. In these daydreams girls that sometimes I knew and sometimes I didn't but always my age would capture me, tie me up, cut off my penis ( I was four so I didn't know what a vagina so I just assumed that girls had nothing there and pee out of their butt so I thought that made me physically a girl ), dress me up as girl usually in something super girly especially disney princess dresses, sometimes give me womens hair styles like long pigtails, I would be forced to do girly things with them, and sometimes send me to a place with a lot of other feminized guys sometimes I knew others times I didn't but always my age. I still don't know what that means but I know I did it for years as a kid and desperately wanted to hate it but always loved it. I was raised in a very conservative and chirstan family who wouldn't talk about lgbtq things. Hell one member of my anuts is atheist and my family says shit about her for being an atheist behind her back. It would be years before I heard about gay people, trans people, crossdressers, and drag queens. I finally got to try on womens clothes one day when I was no younger than 4 but no older than 6 when at my grandparents house I swapped clothes with my cousin. She was wearing a cute fake jaguar skin top with a matching fake jaguar skin skirt. I felt so alive and powerful. That was so much fun and was of the fun experiences I can remember until my grandparents caught us. My grandparents scolded, insulted, and punished us. They told us under no circumstances we could wear clothes of the opposite gender again. When my parents came a picked me up my grandparents told my parents what happened so then my parents scolded, insulted, and punished me. It wasn't until I was 7-9 that I was able to summon the courage to try and crossdress again. I tried to wear one of my sisters dresses. My sister didn't care and told me I could but right before I started to change my mom caught me and scolded, insulted, and punished me again. When I was 12 I had my first boner but not thinking about a girl or a guy I got it thinking about wearing a pretty dress. It was odd and still don't know what to think about it. Even today while yes I occasionally get boners looking at or thinking about girls or guys I usually get them from thinking about something releated to crossdressing, being a girl, or tg tf sissy captions. I didn't know what mascurbation when I was 12 so thinking about the stuff I talked about before would somethimes make me handless cum which I hated so that is how I stopped doing that. Sorry yes I do have to talk about sissy captions though. When I was 12 a few mounths after the first boner I found them and it was an insane moment for me. I found out I wasn't alone their are other people like me. I thought I was a freak and the only person like me on the planet so it felt so good to find out their was a place wear I belonged. Yes the fact that sissy captions was what I found is probably not good. I wish I could of found drag queens or I would not of found out about trans people from my transphobic uncle instead of sissys but I would be lying if I didn't have the same reaction like a life of confusion and fear is finally making since knowing you actually belong.  A year after that I entered jr. high were my friends got me super into anime and the next two years we were all weebs ( I still am but now like a episode a week not four a day). One thing that really caught my eye were traps. I fell in love with and wished I was one of them. I wished I was cute, got to wear cute outfits, do girly things, have everyone think you are a girl, and be treated as a girl even though I am a boy. I could never bring myself to crossplay even though I wanted to so badly. I rember wishing I could look like a human version of raven from teen titans so when I got to high school with no one I knew everyone would be shocked that I was a guy because I looked like a girl. I knew I wanted to look like a girl 24/7, sound like a girl 24/7, be treated like a girl 24/7, and dress like a girl 24/7 but I told myself that I'm not trans I'm just a crossdresser or a trap because I still have a dick. At the beginning of 8 grade I decided to grow out my hair. I don't know why I did I just did and oh my god it was great. My long hair ment so much to me. I would look in the mirror and feel happy to see something I like. I would watch it grow and get longer feeling ecstatic. My family didn't feel the same. They would constantly bully me for it saying it looked bad and I should cut it. I can't count how often I was told to cut it. Some family members would offer to take me to get it cut right then and their and pay completely out of their pocket just so it would be gone. Finally I gave in and got it cut right before high school. I liked it short for the first day but after that first day I was filled with regret, frustration, sadness, and anger. I hated my hair so so so much. I never really liked my body but I never really realised how much I hated it until I had something I liked about it and lost it. I cut my hair right before I started freshman year and now I am about to start senior years and that haircut I just talked about is my most recent. My hair thankfully goes down to my breasts and my hair means the world to me. When I look in the mirror I try to look look at my hair and blue eyes because those are the only things I like about my body. I am to fat, everything about my face is ugly, I wish I was short but I am 5""11 which sucks, I could go on and fucking on. When I look in the mirror I feel sad, pist, frustrated, sick, and I want to punch the mirror. I don't like taking pictures of myself or being in pictures. Its no accident that my Instagram that I have had for over 3 years only has one picture of me posted on it. I guess I should talk about high school which has been werid and shit. Things turned from wouldn't it be great to why the hell can't I have it. I feel awkard using male locker rooms and male bathrooms everywear. Whenever family members or friends of my family who knew me as a kid comes up to me and says how I have grown up or are growing up to be such as strong handsome young man I feel sad, awkward, and sick. Whenever you have to mark are you a boy or a girl I feel awkward, pist and sick. When other is provided I usually choose other but even other doesn't feel right. I wear nail polish and makeup which are just the best and I love them but I am broke and can't drive so I need my parents help but they always get in my way and try to stop me so I have very little and have to spread out my use. At least they let me buy nail polish and make up though. They won't let me pierce my ears because I'm not a girl. I'm not gonna lie when I asked and they said no and told me that my sister can because she is a girl but I can't because I am not it really hurt. I finally got the courage to crossdress again and decided to crossplay yuri from doki doki but my parents stopped me. I am only 17 and I tried cosplaing yuri when I was 16 so I have no credit card or ability to drive so everything I buys goes through my parents. You could argue that I should ask my friends but I am a depressed, self hatting, socially anxious, shy, weird, loner, outcast, emo kid. I only have one friend. I can and have turned to him for help with many things but not with this because while my family is more of a scold and insult were it comes to drag stuff his is more the beat your ass type. I felt so sad, hopless, and envy so much envy at the con. Its like every other girl I see feels me with envy. Why can't I be her. Why aren't I a girl why wasn't I born a girl. Look she doesn't even care that she has it why can't I have it. For years now I have felt depressed and hated my body. I think I might be trans but I may not. I have gender dysphoria but I don't have bottom dysphoria. I don't love my dick but I don't hate it either it is just kind of there. Sure if I was offered a pill that could magically turn it into a vagina I would take it but I probably won't pay thousands of dollars and go through a painful surgery to get rid of it. I hear these horror stories from trans people both mtf and ftn about how bad their bottom dysphoria is and I have just never felt it. Also it might just be a fetish because I might have a problem. Every since I was 15 I have mascurbated to stuff like tg tf captions like 8 times I week. Its like everyday I think about being sexy get horny and jerk off. I worried I am just a fetish. I don't want to transition if I am just a fetish but I really want to transition. I really hate being a guy. I don't think non binary would cut it but that would be so much better than being a guy. I really want to be a girl. Sure when I watch straight porn I wish I was the girl but that could just be a fetish. Yes when I close my eyes I am a girl, when I dream about the future I am a girl, when I think about love I am girl, and when I think about ny wedding I am a girl but could all still just be a fetish. I thought well I should probably ask trans people if I am trans or just a fetish because fuck if I know. Sorry this was so long and I know no one read it or even seen it but I needed to rant. I just feel so confused"	"It sounds like you are but that is really a decision you have to make for yourself. A way dysphoria can manifest is in a way that you described your sexual attraction being part of being the turned into a girl. I would say definitely explore the option when you can if it makes you happy.
So like u/ChloeRosee, no one can decide if you're trans except for yourself. But I'm gonna be frank and also say holy shiz, does this sound like my girlfriend's story of how she figured out she was transfemale. She also thought it was a fetish, but then later on she was like, ""Nope, I'd be happier living my life as a girl, so that's what I'm going with!"" Moreover, she also has no bottom dysphoria like you do, cross-dressed as female characters prior to identifying as female, wants long hair, absolutely despises haircuts, loves to wear feminine clothes (we're getting her a closet full of [pastel goth](https://www.bing.com/images/search?q=pastel%20goth%20outfits&qs=n&form=QBIR&sp=-1&ghc=2&pq=pastel%20goth%20outfit&sc=8-18&sk=&cvid=5EF620A3CA5849D686A29F39F69A0CC7) outfits this fall), hates being referred to as male in any way, has nail polish and make up, and would very much like to wear a dress at her wedding. (I'm not going to say 'our"" because I'm a superstitious person afraid of jinxes but we both agreed that we're in a long-term relationship so hopefully I can say 'our' in the future) That being said, I think the biggest question right now would be regardless of what everyone else thinks or says, would you be happier to be a girl? If you grew up in a world where you were free to choose your own gender and be completely accepted for it, would you want to be a girl? Stuff about transition can come later since that's too much information for one sitting. Right now, we're just taking baby steps, and the first step is to figure out for yourself whether you are fine with being your birth gender or not. You don't even have to answer that question now, if ever even, because the most important thing is that the decision you make is one that would make you happier than the other.

Also, as someone who graduated high school last year, look into whether or not your college has a LGBTQ+ resource center there if you plan on attending college/university. I can't speak for all colleges, especially for those outside the U.S., but I figured out I was nonbinary around high school graduation and been exploring my gender identity on campus, so maybe my experience can help out in some way. Best of luck girl!!!!
This is happening to everyone all over the world like it's a curse but it's your decision and I think trans personaly and I think I'm trans to I do all the things your doing love watching tg tf from sappirefoxx so that's stuck on my mind to and I fucking hate Christan rules so much I'm Catholic and I believe in God to all I say is I think your trans text me on reddit to tell me if I should tell my mom cause I'm shy tell her

How the YouTube Algorithm saved my life (TW FOR DEPRESSION AND DYSPHORIA)	"I was 16 years old, had already battled with depression for four years and I had informed myself about depression on Youtube for a while, thinking about getting therapy. Especially after a certain incident, where I had almost taken my life but instead kind of suddenly replaced the numbness with anger and cut my hair short that previously reached my hips.

I was laying in bed again, like I mostly did during that time, scrolling through YouTube. And noticed a video that just, kept getting recommended to me, and I thought it was really annoying because the thumbnail showed a pride flag and I still wasn't completely out of that queerphobic thinking that my parents had put into my head.

But getting it recommended every single time was so annoying, so I just clicked on it. I didn't know what that T in LGBT was, so I was a little curious anyways. At first, I wasn't really listening. But after a few minutes, what the person said in the video felt a little too familiar. And that's when I realised that my mother lied to me and no, not everybody feels that way.

So, I informed myself a little more about it and had a total breakdown, but different from all the last times. This time, I didn't want to die. In fact, I never got to that point again afterwards.

I'm going to be 21 this year. I can't believe I got here. I never thought I would get to the point of moving out of home (which I will be doing in under 2 months), or reaching my 20th birthday, or being able to look into the mirror and feel so comfortable that I just have to take a photo. I still get dysphoria, but I know it will get better because I can have top surgery soon and holy shit, my voice is so perfect now, I love it. Also, I know what to do now if I get an especially bad dysphoria day, so it's manageable.

For the first time in my life, I understand what it's like to be able to see yourself in 10 years. I know what to say when someone asks me where I see myself in the future. I no longer want to die. I want to live, and be happy, because it has gotten better and better and I know I will be happy, because I know what's wrong and I have a dream now and friends who actually care for me and support me and I'm finally getting out of this toxic family.

Thank you for reading this, it means a lot to me. I kind of just wanted to throw this out in the world."	"That! is indeed maybe the only really good thing social media has to offer:)

I wish someone explained this all to me when i was younger:( But better late than never!:)

I'm really glad its working out for you and you can see yourself in the future again!!
Thanks! All the best to you!"	nen9ye	trans	9	1.0	2021-05-17 18:04:49
This is what I want!	"I want everyone no matter what you identify as.  MTF, FTM, Nonbinary whatever your label is.  I want you to be free and happy to live the life you feel you need to live.  Our time on this Earth is fleeting and we all should get to live our best life without someone else standing in the way.  I don't need to get another person decision but I do need to respect it.  I would like people to respect mine.  That's not too much to ask.  This is NOT a rivalry we don't and shouldn't push each other down to make ourselves appear better than the next.  We are all outside the ""norm"" of society.  It doesn't matter what label we use society as a whole looks at all of us as a ""freak""  why do it to each other.  Support each other even though a person's journey or path may be a little different is what we should all be doing.  I know I have said things out of anger that I didn't really mean just to to hurt and I really feel bad about it.  But when you get in the moment it's hard to let old habits go.  But I want to say again all of yall are diamonds üíé.   I don't care what anyone says about you."		qg9ei1	trans	8	1.0	2021-10-26 15:51:31
TikTok: A Rant	"Hey r/trans,

I'm still a baby pre-everything trans but I just want to vent for a moment about TikTok. Lately the algorithm has been putting live feeds in my fyp of cis people arguing/debating the merits of trans rights. I'm 32 so I have a fair bit of life experience not to take everything personally, while finding nuance in a debate, but every one of these discussions makes me so angry.

I'm so tired of other people having an opinion and actually getting to vote on if I have a right to the same freedoms as them, even though I'm a law abiding tax paying citizen. I'm tired of religious orgs having a voice on whether my existence should be tolerated when I've done nothing but exist. I hate that I spent my whole life trying to people please and be the ""man ""everyone wanted me to be, but the moment I put myself first I'm a sinner, a disappointment, and I'm hurting the family with my ""choices.""

I never asked to be trans but here I am, a trans woman. So I get really ticked off when I see cis/het people debating the merits of my existence and dismissing any debate to the contrary because an old book that claims to be the world of god, that was manipulated by men for their benefit throughout centuries, is their sole source of their reason and morality.

I'm so angry about a lot of things and have no outlet for that anger."	"I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with that. I tend to ignore, block, or generally mark as unwanted if things like that pop up. I know it‚Äôs untrue, and we are who we are. It‚Äôs scary to think of our rights resting in the balance, but if I‚Äôm not in the head space to think about it, I don‚Äôt. 

Instead of getting angry over something you know is wrong, stop it at the source and immediately mark the videos as unwanted or scroll past. The algorithm will eventually notice and avoid that kind of content. If you want to go farther in the other direction, go and save some tags or scroll through some nicer things like #transjoy or trans milestones. 

We can fight for our rights, we can voice our opinions, we can educate people, but we shouldn‚Äôt be worrying and getting flustered over uneducated people who‚Äôs opinions don‚Äôt belong in our soup. That being said tho, feel your feelings. Don‚Äôt ignore what these things make you feel. Notice them, express them, and change what happened so it doesn‚Äôt happen again.

Mansplaining as a TransMan	"Growing up as a woman for the first 15 years of my life, I was constantly talked over, mansplained, silenced, and not taken seriously at all by men and other people who refused to listen to me because I was a ‚Äúgirl.‚Äù This of course, being paired with ADHD and wanting to be as helpful and informative as possible, just dug myself a deeper hole for wanting to talk about ANYTHING and either being either ignored and/or not taken seriously as a girl. 

So when I transitioned into male at age 16, it was a nice surprise to be listened to for the first time in my life. Which is why the mansplaining argument is so difficult for me now. Don‚Äôt get me wrong, I know exactly about the struggles of women and female empowerment because I grew up as a girl. I was raised as a woman, I was taught how to behave like a woman, I was expected to be a woman. 
Even as a little kid, I was always an over-explainer because I loved being as thorough, helpful, and informative as possible. It feels strikingly hard for me now, as a man, to explain anything to my friends, coworkers, family members, etc without getting labelled as ‚Äúmansplaining‚Äù things to people. 

I feel like I‚Äôve never been able to talk about anything in my life, even if trying to be helpful. I was silenced as a girl growing up because of the opposite gender, which angered me profoundly, and now that I‚Äôm a grown man I‚Äôm being silenced again because of the opposite gender. 
Believe me, I recognize how hard it is to talk freely about things as a woman and I‚Äôm so glad the times are changing. But the mansplaining thing is really making me, my opinions, and my voice feel invalidated because of how I was brought up. Any tips on how to overcome this?"	"Being helpful isn't the same thing as mansplaining. If you're mansplaining, by definition you are not being helpful.

See https://twitter.com/kimgoodwin/status/1020029572266438657 .
I'm a trans woman and growing up as a boy I was taught similar things in general I just try not to speak over anyone but I understand what you mean
Instead of focusing on ""mansplaining"" and ""gender roles"" why not just practice saying what you have to say more concisely and paying attention to when others are being talked over or if they were trying to say something while you were trying to finish what they have to say.



It's not really a man or woman thing, it's more about assertiveness,  attentiveness, and politeness. The right mix of that and it don't matter if you're man, woman, or child.
Are you sure you want to overcome it? There are worse things than fitting a stereotype of your true gender. And, you sure as hell aren't the only man that explains a bit too much. I think you should be true to yourself.
Mansplaining?
This might be more to do with your ADHD and anxiety imo.
I think the thing that worries me the most is that I am the kind of person that if a topic is being brought up and I have knowledge about it I like to share with other people, but I‚Äôm worried i‚Äôll be seen as mansplaining because of it. Like I said I have ADHD, so I love explaining things and talking about things I have knowledge about. I am worried that I might come across as a mansplaining things.
Maybe you‚Äôre right, thanks. It‚Äôs not that I get ‚Äúcalled out‚Äù for mansplaining, per se. it‚Äôs more like I‚Äôm worried that I‚Äôll get excited talking about something I‚Äôm knowledgeable about and end up speaking over people because I like to explain things.
I also have ADHD which was diagnosed very late. I realised I would also talking over people because I was anxious about forgetting what I was going to say. But I think I'm also guilty of mansplaining because I'm neurodivergent."	owuole	trans	8	0.91	2021-08-03 03:15:10
No dysphoria as a child?	"I didn't really have dysphoria as a young child, and I'm wondering if anyone else can relate. 

I definitely had problems as a kid that pointed to something being wrong. Lots of outbursts, anger towards the world, and I also had this weird obsession with wanting to dress up ""like a guy"" for Halloween. But until I was 12 or 13, I really didn't experience any typical dysphoria. I guess that would make sense, as male and female bodies are basically the same until you start puberty. But every trans person I met had childhood dysphoria, not me. 

I think I am feeling insecure because I recently watched a detransition video where the women mentioned that hse should have realized she wasn't trans because she had no dysphoria as a kid. And I can't help but think ""what if that's the case for me?""

For reference, I started my transition 2 1/2 years ago. I am pre everything but I pass as cis. I'm 17, started transitioning at 14. Being a guy just feels normal and comfortable now, that euphoric honeymoon stage is over. The last time I got misgendered was in March by a kid who knows I'm trans and it hit me like a truck. So I know I have dysphoria, I know I'm a guy. But I can't help but feel insecure.

TLDR: did anyone else not feel dysphoria as a young child?"	"My perspective: your overreacting, I think the majority of trans people got dysphoria when they started puberty.
i think that‚Äôs the same with some people. young kids don‚Äôt really have any defining features of gender for the most part so having dysphoria grows more during puberty. in my experience, i was extremely feminine as a small kid, wearing a rainbow dress almost every day, playing with dolls, and buying almost anything that was pink. but when puberty kicked in and i got hips and tits and shit, i was like ‚Äúnah, this ain‚Äôt right‚Äù and i felt less comfortable looking feminine and it was so annoying because everyone would call me by an extremely feminine name i didn‚Äôt like and would put me into female gender roles that made me feel like shit. 

tl;dr: puberty‚Äôs a bitch, it‚Äôs (at least in my experience) normal to not have dysphoria as a child
I'm agender and I didn't experience body dysphoria as a little kid. It was only at puberty when my body started shouting my assigned gender to the world, that it hit me. Since I didn't know what was wrong with me, I thought it was the usual "" I hate my body"" stuff that teens go through. Looking back, I can see dysphoria where I didn't see it before."	hzq9nv	trans	8	1.0	2020-07-29 00:11:37
I lost a friend, and I‚Äôm trying to keep the right mindset	"I hope this is okay to share here. 

Awhile back, a dear friend of mine - we‚Äôll call her Jen - came out to me as trans. (For clarity: She was born with male parts, but I refer to her here now as female.) Nobody else knew except for my husband and Jen‚Äôs spouse. Jen married a woman a few years ago (we‚Äôll call her Anne). Anne did not take this news well - understandably so. 

Jen and I talked a lot over the following weeks about her worries, her journey to this realization. She asked me questions and I made it very clear to her that I loved her regardless of her name or how she presented. I told her she could be a dinosaur and I‚Äôd still love her. Jen experimented with a new name for a bit. We sent fun girl memes to each other. I told her that as she was figuring herself out and deciding how she ultimately wanted to proceed, that even if she decided she didn‚Äôt want to transition or maybe wasn‚Äôt trans after all, she was free to be whoever she was without judgement from me. 

Jen‚Äôs wife discovered that she had shared this all with me and was very angry. She told Jen she didn‚Äôt want her talking to me at all. She felt I was undermining her and working against her, trying to ruin her marriage. So with Jen‚Äôs blessing, I reached out to Anne to say that I loved her too (the four of us were pretty close) and was here for her, and wanted her to know I wasn‚Äôt pushing Jen to do anything. That my main goal was to make sure Jen felt loved and not alone. Anne told me to ‚Äúmind my fucking business‚Äù and a few other surprisingly cruel things, demanded I never speak to her again and blocked me on every platform possible. It surprised me, I‚Äôll admit. I expected some misdirected anger but it was more than I anticipated. 

Jen and I continued chatting and remained close just as we always had been. She kept saying how thankful she was for me and how I‚Äôd helped her to feel like she wasn‚Äôt alone. And then suddenly Jen went MIA. It scared me. I feared the worst. Finally she told me she just needed some space and I said okay. We spoke a few more times when Jen initiated and then over the last 6 months I‚Äôve reached out a couple times just to let her know I was thinking about her and hoped she was well... She replied a few times, and a few times not at all. 

It‚Äôs been a few months and today I send a text. It appears my number has been blocked. 

In a way I‚Äôm not totally surprised. But I‚Äôm still really sad. A quick perusal of social media shows that Jen and Anne are still together, which I suppose I‚Äôm happy for, and Jen appears to still present as male. (No  judgement or anything there.) I wonder if Jen decided not to transition at all, or perhaps determined that she wasn‚Äôt trans after all.  

But I‚Äôm really heartbroken. Jen and I were friends for nearly a decade. I viewed her like the family you choose. I suspect Anne may have demanded Jen cut us off and that is really sad if so. 

I‚Äôm here because I thought you guys might have some more perspective to lend here. I‚Äôm trying not to feel heartbroken about this or focus on how unfair this feels to me. It‚Äôs not about me. Jen‚Äôs the one going through something significant. I suppose I have to just accept it for what it is and move on, but I‚Äôm struggling to do so and not feel somewhat bitter. I‚Äôm trying to remind myself that it‚Äôs not about me, but I‚Äôm having a hard time with that. 

Thank you for reading. 

Edit: spelling errors"	"This makes me so sad.  For everyone involved. 

You are probably right, Jen was cut off from speaking to you because of the support you provided and Anne trying to isolate, control and manipulate the relationship back to what she wants.

I relate to this so much because my own spouse is trying to do the same.  I, personally, only have my therapist as an Ally and reddit.  My wife tells me I need to get off Reddit as it‚Äôs making me suicidal.  I don‚Äôt have the heart to tell her that it‚Äôs the constant reminder I‚Äôm not allowed to transition that fuels my depression and that Reddit is my only source of hope. 

I don‚Äôt tell her this to help her.   I don‚Äôt want to manipulate my wife with my depression to let me transition, I need her to confront her own transphobia/homophobia in order for our marriage to succeed.  We decided on a schedule and I am honoring it as best I can and that includes not pushing things, and establishing relationships that could threaten our marriage.  It‚Äôs about rebuilding trust with my spouse and it‚Äôs a struggle. 

I suspect Jen needs a-lot more support, but if your support was met with hostility it may be better to follow her lead and let the relationship cool for a while.  Things are always messy and hopefully your friendship can continue.  In my opinion, Patience and understanding are the best thing you can offer right now. 
ok so i can't give advice cuz i'm 14 but i can say fuck you anne
[deleted]
You do what you need to do. If she won't love you as you she really doesn't deserve to be in your life.

I guess not really my place but...

Pure love is ONLY wanting a person to be happy. She is not letting you be happy.

Hope you get it sorted soon friend. ‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm pretty much with you there. 
Thank you for your reply. Yes, I fear that Jen and I have seen the end of our friendship. I wish her well. I kind of wish terrible diarrhea on her wife though. 

Congrats to you on your self-discovery and living your truth! 
I do feel she loves me for me.  We‚Äôve proven our love to each other more strongly than I ever thought possible. But transphobia is such an ingrained,  insidious fear.  It takes time and exposure to overcome.  As we move through this process shes been able to support me a little more each day.  She made a-lot of progress with me wearing skirts and growing my hair.  She helps me dye it now.  But she doesn‚Äôt want me to do this.  She clings to hope that I will wake up one day and be okay with being a man for the rest of my life.  That takes time to let go.  I‚Äôm trying to give her that time because I love her and I want her to be happy as well. "	ad2m4g	trans	8	1.0	2019-01-06 05:10:22
Dysphoric Compliments	"I felt good today. Put on a nice shirt. It has little flowers on it, but it's a man's button down. I'm proud of this find and paired it with a solid tie. Feeling good.

People keep calling me pretty. I hate it. I've never been ""pretty"" my whole goddamn life. I've been ugly duckling. Was called ""butterface"" through my teens. Now I know my own dislike of mirrors is part anger, part sadness, part dysphoria.

I don't want to be pretty. It is too much to ask to look handsome instead? I'm not femming it up. Gay men can wear purple. I'll never pass, but somehow being called pretty when trying to dress differently only makes me want to crawl in a hole.

Humph. And I left the house feeling okay today, too."	I hate when that happens. I dress like a slob around my parents so I can avoid that, and dress up when out and about around strangers, who are less likely to comment.	v3gew8	trans	8	0.83	2022-06-02 19:11:25
Need to get this anger off my chest. (Rant)	"I haven‚Äôt expressed this to anyone. Primarily because I don‚Äôt have anyone to express it to and I‚Äôm tired of keeping it inside. 

So I started T three days ago. After talking to so many doctors and waiting so long I finally have it. That‚Äôs not where the problem lies. In the process of getting HRT, speaking with doctors who work with transgender people, my mother was present for a lot of these talks. During two of these meetings, she had brought up the idea that the reason I‚Äôm trans is because I have ‚Äúmiddle child syndrome‚Äù She described it as being when the oldest child is getting attention and the youngest child is getting attention and the middle child doesn‚Äôt have anything going on so they feel like they need to. Indirectly she said I was trans for attention. Twice. With me in the room. 

I hate that she does this. Many other times have made me believe that she whole heartedly does not believe I‚Äôm trans. Maybe because I don‚Äôt want to be a big buff hairy man. She doesn‚Äôt understand it, so apparently I don‚Äôt either. My mother is not emotionally mature and there are many things I wish I could tell her about but I can‚Äôt for so many reasons. She only sees me as my AGAB and always calls me things like ‚Äúhon‚Äù and ‚Äúsweetie‚Äù and ‚Äúbaby‚Äù when she doesn‚Äôt say it to ANYONE else. Not even my 8 year old brother. Not to my older trans brother. It pisses me off.

I‚Äôm tired of holding all this anger in. Thank you for making it all this way if you have. Just really annoyed and have been for so long."		npfp7h	trans	8	1.0	2021-05-31 22:59:32

I wanted to share some info because I feel it's important.	"I'm almost 3 months in hrt in my mid 20s MTF....I'm not going to post physical changes on here(as I have some but still early to see full ""results"")....I want to talk about mental and emotional changes...My anger has reduced, my self esteem has increased slightly...I feel like some things irritate me less but also other things trigger other emotions. It's odd, I feel good about it but also kinda put off by how different things feel on a mental/emotional level. I think if anyone is considering this life change you need to be prepared and mentally ready for people to not like your choice...or at least good with your choice because that's what matters. I am but I think not everyone will be within themselves...there's more to it than physical changes and it's really important to be aware of...not questioning anyone here or how they feel about themselves but something to consider. I am afraid but also excited and that's ok. In other words, just be yourself and don't rush anything it'll come in time. There is a reason and as long as you can validate for yourself and just live your best life...you'll be able to find happiness no matter what. Don't let this post put you off but I encourage you to think about it before making a choice like this. Best of luck."	Agreed.

Family misgendering you out of anger?	"Anyone have parents or family members that misgender you out of anger or as a ‚Äúpunishment‚Äù? 

Accidentally made a mess in the kitchen today because I thought I was helping by emptying out some boxes, and after my parents displayed their anger by huffing and puffing and explaining what I did wrong, they seemed to deadname and misgender me for the better part of an hour out of anger? Or as a punishment? 

This isn‚Äôt the first time they‚Äôve switched to my old identity as a result of anger/disappointment, but it always confuses me none the less, bc idk if it‚Äôs intentional or not, especially since they‚Äôre really good with my name and pronouns regularly."

Yeah I tend to lol. It‚Äôs normally I thing I just gotta wait out, cuz they go back to calling me my name and pronouns anyways when they stop being mad
Yeah, I know, but as of now I haven‚Äôt figured out a way to stop them from doing this :/ hoping they stop soon but for now I just do what another commenter said and ignore them if they call me by my dead name and pronouns. They end up stopping though once they‚Äôre done being angry so it‚Äôs not a permanent thing

I told my therapist about this and her solution was to do a family session, and I am TERRIFIED.

Question for those who have gone through HRT (particularly MTF people)	"I have an appointment for Hormone Readiness Assessment coming up in about a month and a half, and I‚Äôm excited, but I‚Äôm also terrified.

I‚Äôve heard that hormones, especially estrogen, fuck with your brain on an immense level, like they shove you through a blender of depression and anxiety and anger and everything all at once on max, and I‚Äôm worried.

Should I be scared? Is it as hard as I‚Äôve heard?"	"No. Rather the opposite. I‚Äôm more emotional than I used to be: a bit quicker to anger and to tears. That‚Äôs kind of it. I am less depressed and more mentally stable than I‚Äôve ever been before. Maybe that isn‚Äôt estrogen‚Äôs doing, but it certainly didn‚Äôt hurt.
Um..  no..  if anything I've been able to process emotion in a more healthy way then before estrogen.
yeah, that's propaganda
To me it‚Äôs just been an incredibly liberating experience. My emotions feel stronger and more alive, I cry a lot more, whether I‚Äôm happy or sad, and sometimes I feel the need for a good cry. I love it. It feels like I‚Äôm actually processing my emotions rather than bottling them up. I‚Äôm a much more capable person altogether now.
>I‚Äôve heard that hormones, especially estrogen, fuck with your brain on an immense level, like they shove you through a blender of depression and anxiety and anger and everything all at once on max,

NOPE!  That's completely WRONG.

Most MTF folks experience a wider emotional range under HRT, just as most women experience a wider emotional range than most men generally.  Most of us MTF-ers experience this as a GOOD thing, not a BAD thing.

With respect to depression and anger, my experience was just the opposite of ""what you have heard,"" in fact.  As HRT progressed, my mood improved.  That knot of anger I always felt inside myself living as a guy gradually dissipated and disappeared."	ebejky	trans	7	1.0	2019-12-16 12:29:42
Is this gender envy?	"I was scrolling Instagram the other day and came across a guy I followed years ago but I hadn‚Äôt seen his profile in a while. He kind of looks like me (afab) but he‚Äôs clearly more masculine and all of a sudden I was hit with this longing to be him and anger that I didn‚Äôt look like him with his shorter hair and stubble and masc passing looks. And that swirled me down a path where I was thinking about how growing up I always wanted to *be* the male characters in whatever I was watching or reading. My friends would have crushes on Han Solo or Will Turner and I had their pictures because I wanted to be them. 

As I got older I attributed this to being asexual but now it‚Äôs hitting me that that might not be solely why lol. I recently started questioning my gender identity and so I‚Äôm trying to learn as much as I can. But is this what gender envy typically feels like?"	"Pretty much.

As for the ace stuff, I'm grey ace myself and as a trans man, I've had. To reevaluate my interest in sex in that am I still on the ace spectrum or do i just not have an interest in having sex as my assigned gender at birth. 

Jury is still out on that one.
Sounds like it yep. I always felt envy towards fictional characters or people I saw on social media simply because of the way they looked or their vibe. I always got a bit mad when I wasn't like them lol.
That‚Äôs a really interesting point about the ace stuff. I really try to avoid my genitals as much as possible. TMI but I can‚Äôt even use a tampon without a panic attack so I do wonder if I had amab genitalia if things would be different
I've been experimenting with packing and it seems to help. There is just something comforting about having something down there even if it isn't physically mine. But some days it's just a reminder of what I don't have and wish I did. 

I also have a realistic dildo and a underwear style harness. Interacting with the toy like its my own body has made a difference too. Very much a yup this is what it's supposed to look like, be able to be interacted with. 

Periods are super dysphoric too, so I get that. Being on hrt stopped my cycle and it's really been a game changer not having to deal with the constant dysphoria from those organs. I'm hoping to get a hysterectomy one day.
One day that is something I‚Äôd like to try. But I do understand that some days it‚Äôs a very difficult reminder. This just reminded me that I used to do that as a child with like socks and eventually got in trouble for it so stopped. Same with trying to wear shorts as ‚Äúboxers‚Äù under my jeans. Lots of repressed memories coming to the surface lately. 

That‚Äôs a very good idea too. Part of me is worried to discover that but I‚Äôve also started down this road and I can‚Äôt just walk away from it. 

Periods are truly the worst. They make me incredibly depressed from both the hormone shift and the constant reminder of what organs are there. I‚Äôm hoping to get on a pill that will stop it completely but it‚Äôs difficult. It‚Äôs also horrible how hard it is to get a hysterectomy if doctors deem it not ‚Äúmedically necessary.‚Äù That needs to change. I hope you can get one soon.
Yeah the euphoria from the experimenting can also lead to dysphoric moments too. It's kinda a catch 22 at times. 

I've never found any pill or other hormonal bc targeting to women to stop my periods and honestly my ordeals in bc in general were highly dysphoric, not to mention having paps or any gynecological based testing done. 

Honestly going on testosterone was the only thing that actually affected my menstrual cycle in year regards. Getting a hysterectomy may be easier as part of transgender health care, it may be considered medically nessisary under certain conditions by your insurance. I know it is with mine. Though there are still hoops. I know it can be done as part of pursuing phalloplasty in my own network. 

But the whole starting down the road being terrifying and you can't unlearn what you learn about yourself or ever go back to the way things were and unknown all the dysphoria...i get it. O started down that road 3 years ago myself.

It's been challenging,  but worth it. And ultimately I'm happier and way less stressed even with the dysphoria because I'm living as a more authentic version of myself.
Oh that‚Äôs incredibly frustrating re: cycle, but thank you for letting me know, as now I know that‚Äôs something I might be able to bring up to my doctor down the road. I haven‚Äôt had a pap and need one, but even the thought of it sends me into a panic spiral and depresses me. I can‚Äôt even use tampons because it makes me nauseous to think about. I guess that‚Äôs dysphoria at play. I hate it so much. 

It‚Äôs definitely a tough road to be on. I feel like these past couple weeks I‚Äôve been really opening my eyes to all these parts of myself that I‚Äôve tried to hide or forget and it is difficult. But I‚Äôm hoping eventually I‚Äôll land with a version of myself I‚Äôm at peace with.

Secrets.	"When I was young, around 14yrs old, I had trouble sleeping at night. I‚Äôd stay awake and wish I wasn‚Äôt a boy,
even hoping I‚Äôd wake up a girl one day. This went on until I was nearly 17. It was then I found out how bigoted my mother was and that my older brother went out hurting people just because they were different. He and a few friends went out ‚Äúgay bashing‚Äù some nights. That‚Äôs when I started to research meditation and combined different types to brainwash myself. Emotions on complete lock down, I almost never smiled and never cried. 

I‚Äôm 40 now, almost 41 and married with three kids. Marriage was a necessity to further my goal of hiding. I was 24 when we married but we met in high school a year after I locked the real me in her cage. 
Guarded by anger only small amounts of any other emotion were allowed, to prevent a break. Thanks to many of these Reddit pages and some YouTube channels I follow, I finally opened the cage. 
Allowing emotions to flow helped but it also hurt. 

When all these emotions and memories attached to them started, I thought I was just a cross dresser. As I dig through and focus, I can remember and sill do feel that I hate the male body. The hair, the genitalia, and the big feet. It‚Äôs just gross and I don‚Äôt want to look at it anymore. It‚Äôs been a tough road but the wife and I are trying to walk it together. She‚Äôs confused and I‚Äôm frustrated, not with her but myself. I am hating myself for hiding for so long. I will be seeking therapy soon but live in a place where it‚Äôs not always easy to be yourself. 

Any advice? What do I do if my insurance won‚Äôt cover therapy? 
That shit gets expensive."	"My path was similar, but I came out to my wife b4 we were married. Things just seem to be easier for trans people today. We are from a more repressed time. I have insurance that will pay, but the best therapist for trans people in my rural area doesn't accept my insurance program, so we negotiated a lower cash fee. IMO therapy for people in our situation is mandatory. Remember what happened in the past is over and unchangeable. Make plans for the future, but live for right now. Wishing you all the best.

Which has me questioning , am I trans or still gender-fluid, and the times where I‚Äôm ok with being a man, is it just varying degrees of tolerance for being a man? J
Any help would be appreciated, thank you!"	"Gender fluid people are trans because no one is assigned gender fluid at birth.
 My definition of gender fluid would you move to the beat of your own drum and you feel comfortable in either gender.
Same here, or at least my wife says so.

Well thank you, I never thought of it that way... I‚Äôm still learning...
Hmmm... thank you for sharing.  I appreciate the insight ... yea that sounds a bit like me , I‚Äôve been told I March to my own beat...
I hope your wife is supportive ?  She and I were just speaking tonight about communicating this with our teenage daughters...
Thank you for sharing.  I feel like the more we all talk about it the more comfortable we can be, and maybe learn from each other‚Äôs trials and experiences...
Yeah of course. None of us are born knowing this stuff and mainstream institutions aren't going to teach it.
I agree.. currently now in an good headspace at all. Very conflicted and difficult to share as many don't understand
Amen.  It‚Äôs hard navigating , so I appreciate the help.
Before posting , I‚Äôve spent months and months just reading and relating to others stories... I think you‚Äôll find support here... if not just reading others stories and offering positivity and a little support goes a long way!!
That's what I am trying to do, support others who have been able to identify and able to take the next steps.
Thank you! You are on your way, it will help, as it has done and still does for me
Your welcome, Your faceapp pic is truly wonderful

All The Reasons I'm Too Scared	"Afab/Transgender too scared to make the switch because...

1. I'm too short (5'' even)
2. I can't afford it (I don't have insurance so...)
3. Feels like it's too late (26 years old)
4. I already have anger issues I'm scared more testosterone could be dangerous
5. I may be able to pass as a boy, but not a man
6. I have ADHD, BPD, Bipolar Disorder, Depression, Anxiety, PTSD and I'm scared the switch could make me unstable again
7. My family, they either wouldn't accept it or would have a **very** hard time
8. I'm scared I'd need injections/treatment for the rest of my life and I'm terrified if for some reason after switching, I lose access to it, what happens then??
9. What if I look worse?
10. Surgery is scary...
11. What if something goes wrong
12. Would I suffer from male-pattern-balding??
13. What if I'm not good at being a man?
14. There's so many reasons and I'm so scared. It's overwhelming."	"Ok, i'm amab but trying to be female so before i transition let me give you the quick rundown (at least with the information i know so far) (btw please see this as not set in stone but advice)

1 There is such thing as short guys, It's fine.

3 From what i've read you are only kinda late once you hit 50, and even then it's still very much so possible.(but personally i believe you aren't too late)

5 It doesn't matter if you can pass as a man, as long as it feels right to you then it is right.

11 Then you can always back out, from what i know there are very little long term effects that are completely permanent.

12 Possibly, but there are things out there to help with that. (I know it's scary that it's still a possibility but trust me, it can be dealt with)

13 You are in this subreddit right? You can always ask for help (Hell you can even dm me and I will help to the best of my ability)

14 Write down the reasons. Take them one at a time. It becomes less scary when you aren't being bombarded with everything all at the same time.

I truly hope this helps, and sorry for not knowing all the answers for your questions. (Ik i've said this but if you need help this subreddit will be very accepting and my dms are always open for advice)
I feel you dog. I could give advice if you want though.
1)short men exist and are all kings
2) makes sense
3)it‚Äôs never to late to be yourself as long as your honest with yourself
4)ok
5) if you believe yourself to be a man you are a man you don‚Äôt have to prove your manliness 
6) see a professional 
7) even if they may not accept you you can love an accept yourself
8)it‚Äôs scary 
9)you can go to a gym and build what you want your body to be, your body is a canvas, make something with it
10)it‚Äôs scary
11)slim chance
12)that‚Äôs a roll of genetics 
13)every man is we don‚Äôt know what we‚Äôre doing we just hope it works
14) take it one step at a time, you don‚Äôt have to do everything at once with it, take it all in stride

depression made its return... TW: SH by biting	"Ive been depressed for as long as I can remember, almost no strong emotions except for a deep sadness and loneliness. There were good times and positive emotions but at the end of the day when I crawled into bed i either felt nothing or despair at the thought of waking up again.

When my egg broke i started feeling happy and excited for what the next day would bring! I accepted myself and it filled this massive hole inside of me, and for the past month I got to experience a range of emotions that I never had before! 

But yesterday it came back, all of my negative thoughts from before along with new ones now they ive accepted my reality. All of my self hatred and my mind telling me that none of my awful qualities have changed just because I came out, I'm still this same terrible human as before.

And the loneliness feels even more hopeless then before, because if no one could be attracted to me when I was a man how could anyone be attracted to me when I start presenting as a very ugly woman? No one will ever have romantic feelings for me, it's already hard for lesbians, let alone trans lesbians living in Texas.

And today I had a fit of anger, throwing things across the room, slamming doors and cabinets, biting myself, crying. I don't even know what triggered it, Im pre hrt, was alone in my house, and had just woken up, so I have no clue why it happened. I wanted to break something but I didn't want to clean it up so i was just throwing water bottles and shit but still...

Thanks for reading my rant/mental spiral if you made it this far, I tried not to mention anything triggering but included a warning about the biting just in case.

Love you peeps,
Zo√´"	"That sucks, sis. From a fellow biter, hang in there. Be aware of when your depression is trying to trick you: for example, it's pretty unlikely that no one found you attractive as a man, and you can't really trust a depressed mind's judgement over your girl look. If Nicole Kidman was depressed, she'd also think she's ugly.

I've no idea if it's possible for you to move, but I assume it isn't. In that case, look for support groups near your area. You might be surprised. 

I think it's impossible to always be in a euphoria high. Now you had a bad day, but you'll feel that joy again. You were not a terrible human before (again, Depressy is a lying bitch) and you aren't now. You're just a girl struggling in a hard world. But I believe in you. You're stronger than you think: few people have been depressed for as long as they can remember.

Keep spinning, girl.
Hey Sofia!
Thank you so much for your kind words and advice! I was in a really bad Headspace for the past few days but ive recovered a bit and rereading this post and reading your comment made me feel a lot better. I know those bad thoughts wont be around all the time, but damn do they suck :P

I cant move yet but in a few months im moving to a nearby city that is a lot more accepting, im super excited and cant wait to make some open minded friends!

Thank you for spreading the love!
Love you sis!"	smm1py	trans	7	1.0	2022-02-07 09:21:19
A letter I hope to be able to send/give to my mom	"While your reading this I hope you don't grow to hate me or feel any different about me. I am truly sorry. I never wanted to disappoint you, but I'm tired of living this lie and phoning it in. I have prayed and prayed about this like you did your divorce. I have felt this way for as long as I can remember. I have never liked girly things, but you could say that is just being a tomboy. How about teaching myself to pee standing up when I was little, wanting to use the boys bathroom so bad when I was in school (and actually doing it once), only playing football at PE and refusing to play with the girls, and other things that can't just be wrote off as ""me being a tomboy"". I have never wanted to be a mom, but you know that. But the thought of being a dad someday seems pleasant. I know you are going to say ""your just saying that because that's how *insert my ftm friend's name* is"" or ""you never would have thought that before you met *insert my ftm friend's name*"", but the truth is I have been aware of this for years. I used to write notes to myself about it then rip them up in anger at myself. This year I have begun feeling like me. I started wearing only men's clothing months ago(not that you noticed) and got my hair cut to help show who I truly am on the outside. I am so sorry, but mom I'm not you daughter. I am your son. I didn't change who I am I've always been a a guy. Please don't say this is a choice because why would I chose to put myself and my family through this hell.
 
Love Your Son, Daniel"		ebrcr7	trans	7	1.0	2019-12-17 05:14:14

Passive aggressive Christmas present for my transphobic mum who kicked me out	"TW: Transphobia, Emotional Abuse

Before anyone says anything I know this is a spiteful thing to do but idc.

My mum kicked me (18ftm) out over the summer because I started testosterone. I've been out to her for over two years and she's never been any sort of supportive but starting T was the final straw. Our relationship has always had issues due to a lot of childhood emotional abuse after her mental health dipped after she had an affair and got divorced from my dad. I'm still in full-time education so don't have enough money saved up to support myself so had to move in with my gran to avoid homelessness and losing my education. My gran is 80 and has to drive over three hours a day to get me to and from college as there are no buses from where we live. It's really unfair and I hate that she's been put in this position, essentially by my mum. It honestly angers me more than the transphobia, especially as she regularly messages my gran telling her about how this is a great opportunity for both me and her in terms of bonding and such and completely disregarding the massive physical and financial strain this has put on her. Whilst I can't work full time, I've got a weekend job to help pay for stuff and am infinitely grateful for my gran.

Anyway, gran being the kind person she is, wants me to get my mum a Christmas present despite the hell she's put me through and the stress she's given my gran. I do see the merit in keeping a relationship with her although atm I don't want her in my life for obvious reasons.

So basically I want to get her a gift full of humourous spite, something assuming, cheap, and not directly rude.

TLDR: My mum's transphobic and kicked me out putting my gran under a lot of stress but I need to get her a Christmas gift so naturally I want to give her something funny and full of spite."	"A bottle of testo and some protein powder
ha this is gold.  a good Christmas card with you looking as masculine as possible with a gf or with women at your sides, maybe even staged in a gym just to stick the hole im ftm in her face is a good one.  something like this [https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/handsome-blond-athletic-male-two-slim-female-fitness-models-doing-shoulder-exercises-with-dumbbells-gym-club\_613910-16313.jpg?w=2000](https://img.freepik.com/free-photo/handsome-blond-athletic-male-two-slim-female-fitness-models-doing-shoulder-exercises-with-dumbbells-gym-club_613910-16313.jpg?w=2000) 

or a really cheap nail polish, or old makeup of yours with a card that says "" you might have better use of this than me"" sticks the idea to her that your not intrested in fem things and ,(2 birds with one stone), that shes not the best looking and needs it to look better,-> could aslo do this with soaps or perfume

but it sounds like in your post you want to stick to her the idea shes running your gran into the grave, that your not financially stable because of her, and that she just generally sucks, so nothing is better than a gift card (handmade or store bought) with 1$ in it and a good long paragraph on how when she gets older youll take care of her how she took care of you, and thats not at all. and maybe lie about how since your taking care of gran that she decided to put your mothers inheritance when she dies to you instead. sounds like your mother only looks out for herself and her needs at the expense of others so i bet thatll get her pissed. idk i might have more ideas later
Simple Christmas card and sign it your Son name
Trans Flag (As cheap as $3.15 shipped on eBay) and a card (as cheap as $1). Definitely try to get a card that is for ""Son to Mother"" and tell her that the flag is to thank her for being your mom and all the support she's given you through life and that she can hang up the flag as an additional sign of her support.
Your gran does alot for you. Maybe you owe her this kindness. Put aside your anger and give this old lady a small bit of peace in her finale days

Can someone help me with figuring out whether I'm trans or not?	"EDIT: Sorry this is posted twice, I was having some trouble with my other account but I think it's resolved.

Hello, I've been having some doubts about my gender identity lately. I'm not really comfortable talking about this with my friends and family right now, but I feel like I can't just keep this bottled up. I feel like I've just been waiting for the answer to finally fall into my lap. Yes, I am trans, or no I am not trans. So I'm hoping that maybe some people here will help me get at least a little bit closer to the answer.

So some background on myself, and some reasons why I think I might be trans, and some reasons why I think I might not:

So I'm 20 years old and was born a male. I never really thought at all that I might be trans until 5-6 months ago. Those feelings initially only really lasted a few weeks, so I figured that maybe it was just a phase, and it was some other kinds of feelings materializing in a weird way. But more recently it's come back, and it feels more serious this time somehow.

Yes, I have had some thoughts at times that seem pretty clearly trans: like I've looked in a mirror, and had the thought pop into my head ""I wish I was a girl"". It's almost subconscious though, like an automatic thought. When I actually think about it more deeply, I'm not sure it's right.

For one thing, I've looked up on Google various ways to ""know if you're trans"". And I feel like my feelings aren't as serious as some other people's? Like I don't hate the idea of being a man or anything. I'm not uncomfortable when people call me a boy or refer to me as ""he"" or anything like that. I don't hate my current body or my penis or anything. Though on the other hand, some of the things I like about my body are sort of more feminine things. Like for example, I have a really small waist for a guy, but I kind of like that. 

Another thing is, while I am definitely only attracted to women (whether that makes me a straight man or a lesbian woman is still to be determined I guess), there are often more unconventional feelings there. Often when I see a very attractive woman, I might actually feel jealous rather than just attracted to her. 

So the other thing that gives me doubts is how new these feelings are? Part of me feels like if I were actually trans this kind of stuff would've come up before. Also I feel like most trans people seem to be more sure about it? Like I've heard people say that when they heard someone else describe being trans, they instantly identified with it, which hasn't been the case for me because, as you can see, I'm still very much having doubts. 

On the other hand, I'm not sure that there were never any signs in my childhood? I could be missing some for sure. And one other big thing is that I've always kind of been obsessed with the concept of transgender since I first heard about it. Like I would look up stories about people transitioning and stuff. Just to give one example, one of my favorite shows is Futurama, and I've seen all the episodes many times. But the episode I've seen the most? The one where Bender turns into a girl. Yeah...I've seen it a lot. Also watched the episode where everyone changes gender a lot, as well as the episode where they switch bodies, as there's some gender swapping there. So as I got older, my interpretation of this obsession was initially that maybe I had a transgender fetish or something, because it wasn't really ever an obsession with the idea of being transgender myself, but other people. 

A couple other things that I don't really think are signs but could be: I don't remember this, but according to my Mom, when I was very young, I was obsessed with the idea of having a sister. I'm an only child, but at stores I would point out clothes intended for girls and tell my Mom that I wanted a sister so that we could get those for her. Again, I don't remember this at all, so I can't really elaborate on those feelings. Another thing is that when I was younger, I would be mistaken for a girl a lot. And sometimes when it would happen I would blush and get really flustered, and that embarrassment seemed more than normal for that kind of situation, so maybe it could be related.

Another big thing is how scary the whole concept feels to me. I've looked up stories and pictures of people transitioning lately to try to see how I would feel about it happening to me, and it really freaks me out. I feel like now some people will want to ask me: if I could press a button to instantly become a girl, would I? Because they would be trying to diagnose if I was just scared of the process and all the inconveniences that might come along the way. But honestly? I really don't know what I would do if I had that button. I'm so unsure what I want.

In terms of how I would feel if I actually were trans, I feel like it would be a little different from what I've seen. I guess this stuff is hard to say for sure since I don't even know if I'm trans yet, but if I were, I don't think I would care about pronouns as much as other people seem to? Like I've seen people talk about how upset they are when people use the wrong pronoun, but I don't think it would bother me all that much (obviously it would if it were part of them trying to deny my identity or oppress me, but otherwise it wouldn't). Similarly, I don't think I would hate my old name if I changed to a more feminine name. I actually quite like my name, and I've never felt like it didn't suit me or anything. Lastly, I don't really have any desire to be ""girly"". Like I'm not into skirts or dresses or anything like that. I've never really had a desire to crossdress or anything. Not saying I would exactly be a tomboy girl if I were trans, but would definitely be far from girly. Not sure if any of that stuff makes a difference, but figured I'd add it in.

Again, I feel like my feelings aren't as extreme compared to trans people I know. Like I'm not really having mental health issues because of this. I'm not depressed or anything. I do have some anxiety issues sometimes, but it's not very severe. Though notably, I get a lot of anxiety whenever I think about this stuff, and I've basically been anxious the whole time I've been writing this post. When I was much younger (like 9 and younger), I had some anger management issues, but those are completely gone. Now I'm pretty much the opposite; I'm fairly hard to anger. So it's not like I feel like I need to be a girl to be happy or anything like that.

A couple random tidbits: I seem to have dreams where I'm a girl a lot. I talk about my dreams to my friends a lot, and one of them even commented on it. And yes, I have daydreamt about what it would be like to be a girl, and I've often wished I could have different ""save files"" for life, like in a game, so that I could be a girl in one of them.

Sorry this post is so rambling, but I wanted to get all my thoughts out on this. I'd love to get some advice on whether or not people think I'm trans, and what I should do next either way. I'd be happy to answer any questions that you think might be relevant, or give more context if it's needed. I'd like to hear from some people who have gone through these kinds of doubts and how they figured it out. Optimally, I'd like to hear from both sides, both people who were doubting and realized they were trans, and also people who realized they weren't (not just people in denial). Though I doubt there are too many people from the latter group on this subreddit, and I don't know how common that is anyway.

Posting this in a public place like this is making this whole thing feel so much more real, and it's kind of freaking me out. But at the same time, I'm pretty happy because it feels so good to get this off my chest even if no one really reads it. As I mentioned, I haven't really shared this with anyone else yet, so it's just been all bottled up until now. 

Thank you to anyone who helps me out! I'm fine to talk publicly in the comments here, but we can also talk over PMs if you think that would be a good idea."	"What helped me figure all my stuff out was actually commiting real time and energy into thinking about all this stuff. I would highly recommend taking like a week to think long and hard about yourself, not just passively wondering, but serious deliberate thought all day everyday until you start to clear some of the fog. Look at all the media you've consumed in your entire life. Think back about any and all insecurities you've had. Stare at yourself in the mirror and really think about yourself, don't be afraid to question everything. One really big card for me was my strong and persistent case of disassociation without really knowing what it stems from, only now have I realized that it was strong case of hidden disphoria. Not every trans person is the same, and we all have differences, so I would strongly encourage finding as many unique stories and cases as possible. Look at scholarly research, look memes, listen to YouTuber, literally consume as much as you can and think as deeply as you can to find out the answers you need. No one hear will be able to out right tell you that you are trans, you will need to figure it out by yourself, through hopefully we can help out a bit, good luck and don't worry about trying to prove yourself, just find the answers you need.
 ""Part of me feels like if I were actually trans this kind of stuff would've come up before. ""

&#x200B;

It just means you haven't paid attention to that side of you before, I had a ""normal"" childhood without any indication i was trans, the only thing i can think of was liking getting my nails done by one of my friends at 12, didn't figure it out till i was 19,  


I suppose you need to ask yourself some questions like, if were putting females and males on a scale of fem and masc where are the lines drawn, whats stopping you from just being an effeminate boy? why do you want to take those extra steps, or how do you see yourself in the future when your old, (for me the idea of turning into an old man freaks me out compared to being a granny lol,)   


With the dreams, in mine i used to have a chic i would talk to at a leafy cafe and then when I started to feel more fem i was the chic instead, most of the time i'm a girl in them now but sometimes i have squid arms lol dreams are weird and prob shouldn't be used as a go to for your gender.

 ""Like I've seen people talk about how upset they are when people use the wrong pronoun, but I don't think it would bother me all that much""

This is most likely in response to stimuli they've experienced. i used to think like that too, but now if someone misgenders me (while i don't cry about it or get angry) i still get way more disheartened than i used to feel, i think its because of the amount of effort I've now put into me and presenting, so to have that sort of glided over is upsetting. but yeah i've had that feeling aswell.

I can't say whether your trans or not, what i can say is experiment, go get some fem clothes or try makeup (I just wear eyeliner lol) or just do your nails or get someone to call you she/her for a day, like Yeah u/Orderxabove1? yeah she's awesome! it can be scary doing those things but not as scary as making bigger decisions  


Also last thing, if you've been on trans subs and articles alot, Hop off them for like a month, see what YOU feel not what other peoples ideas are. :) that really helped me decide tbh.
Yeah, this is really the first day that I've spent a lot of time thinking about this, with posting here and doing some research. Like I said, a part of me was just kind of waiting to the answer to magically fall into my lap, but I do know that that's probably not going to happen. Thanks for the advice, I will do more research and think about all of these things.
>It just means you haven't paid attention to that side of you before

Yeah, I don't completely doubt that there were things that had come up before that I just didn't notice or think about in this way, though they wouldn't be that major, or I probably would've remembered them.

>if were putting females and males on a scale of fem and masc where are the lines drawn, whats stopping you from just being an effeminate boy?

Yeah, who knows, maybe it doesn't need to be that extreme. I've been considering the idea that maybe I'm non-binary or something as well.

>dreams are weird and prob shouldn't be used as a go to for your gender.

Haha, probably not, but thought I'd mention it anyway.

>This is most likely in response to stimuli they've experienced. i used to think like that too, but now if someone misgenders me (while i don't cry about it or get angry) i still get way more disheartened than i used to feel

Yeah, that makes a lot of sense. That's why I gave a disclaimer that I couldn't be completely sure how I would feel if I actually had gone through some of this stuff. 

>I can't say whether your trans or not, what i can say is experiment, go get some fem clothes or try makeup (I just wear eyeliner lol) or just do your nails or get someone to call you she/her for a day, like Yeah u/Orderxabove1? yeah she's awesome! it can be scary doing those things but not as scary as making bigger decisions

Hm, interesting ideas for sure. I'll definitely try some of these things and see how I feel.

>Also last thing, if you've been on trans subs and articles alot, Hop off them for like a month, see what YOU feel not what other peoples ideas are. :) that really helped me decide tbh.

Yeahhh, that's probably a good idea to do at some point. It's easy for these feelings to get blown out of proportion if I'm spending a lot of time reading about what they could mean, or experiences of people who had much more extreme versions of those feelings. So yeah, I'll probably take a break from these kind of places soon.

Thanks for the advice, that was helpful.

Allowing Self (26)	"Peace. Release. It all comes when things are acknowledged. For Myself. A whirl wind of life filled with a constant identity crisis, sexual identity crisis, daddy issues. I have allowed it all.  
I have allowed to feel the pain, anger, sadness, regret, dwelling, numbness, disappointment, sorrow. I breathe. I try Again. I have had enough, of the struggle, of the change of my body emotions. I am tired of allowing it consume and allowing my Pain Body to take over. This is for me but if it helps others than great.  
Growing up in a little suburban city outside of Toronto was joyful, open, bright and freeing. The constant thoughts of the big city being so close that I could hop on a train to get there in under an hour always filled myself with pride and joy to live where I am. It wasn't until I was at the end of high school that I needed to get away. Get away from everything I have ever known to that date; friends, family, scenery, locations, stores, parks, streets etc. I understand that this is all coming out of privilege and I acknowledge that.  
Getting away was something I needed for myself, to be on my own, to be accountable for myself (in some degree), to be just me, without no one else by my side. This took me to living in London, Ontario for 3 years, which was filled with its own joy, friendships, ups and downs. It was freeing. It was what I needed to get to the point where I knew deep in my core that a 9-5 job, will never suffice my drive, my fulfilment and who I am as a Human Being. Realignment.  
Being away from everything I had known for 3 years was exactly what I needed to really become the person I am Today. The Trans Woman I am Proud to say I am today.   
From that Moment Until today (which will be shared with time), of course life throws at you wicked curve balls with its own set of waves and rollercoasters, from the highest of highs to the lowest of lows.   
I am Healing, but lets be real, Aren't we All? We are All trying to find ourselves. We are All Trying to find Who We Are, For Ourselves.   
""To Find Happiness, You Must Find Your Own Place"". The process and journey is the most important part of life. Be Vulnerable, Stay True to Who You are. It Makes You, YOU. We Need more of that. More of Your Divine Energy, Your Unique Likes and Dislikes, Thoughts and Actions.   
I love you. <3

Its... the nothing	"Yeah things arent going well here. Made the stupid fucking decision to tell me wife I think I'm trans while on a camping trip a few weeks ago. She had just been told all her business travel was canceled for the foreseeable future due to Covid and shes legitimately afraid. Then I go and drop the trans bomb on her. Now shes afraid for the future of her career and her marraige.

I thought things were getting better in the weeks that followed. We had a couple breakdowns where she hid in our room and cried in bed. We talked and shared and she told me not to walk on eggshells around her or make it a big deal. She even offered to go through her makeup and see what I can experiment with.

I had a vierual session with my counselor and asked my wife to Join me so she could talk and show her she isnt alone, that there are resources for spouses of trans people.

One of her biggest complaints is that she doesnt understand why I'm chasing a label. She says that I've always been chasing a label of some kind. I'm not entirely sure I agree with that and if I'm chasing any label now, it's that I want to live as the woman i feel i am; however, just in case I'm not actually trans, I want to take things slow and try dressing as a woman and wearing makeup. I dont believe a woman HAS to wear makeup or dress in dresses. Hell my aesthetic is more tomboy but I do enjoy the idea of dresses and skirts and flowy things even if my 6'2"" stout frame would make me look like a linebacker in a dress. 

Last night I asked her to go through her makeup finally and she said OK but then after like an hour or so she started to get distant and I could tell she was hurting. We finished dinner and instead of going back to look through the makeup stuff, I put on an episode of a tv show because I didnt want to rush her or push her. Which she likely took as walking on eggshells again around her so she went back to our guest room and locked her self in and wouldn't open the door or talk to me though she responded to a few texts. I finally went to bed and texted her to come sleep in her own bed, she didnt have to talk to me. 

She did finally come to bed and she put on an undershirt which she has only ever done one other time in our 10 years of marraige. I had to take 2 sleeping pills which I normally only take a half of one in order to sleep and I still was awake and stressing all night. 

I knew this wasnt going to be easy but I wasnt prepared for just how hard it would be. I've had to stop myself twice from looking for apartments in fear of an inevitable divorce and her kicking me out of the house. She told me in our shared session that I didnt give her enough credit, which tells me shes stronger and more understanding than i think she is, this will just take time and will be hard on her. I dont want to give up on us and the life weve built. 

I love her and i hope she still loves me. 

More and more for every moment I feel like giving up and that nothingness feeling of hopelessness and void of any emotion( imagine riley from Inside out when shes on the greyhound bus and her console goes gray) I get these surges of anger like NO you wont give up, you wont just fade away. You will fight for HER... both of them. Your wife and yourself.

I swear my mind works like a video and sound byte reel... a scene from The Abyss comes to my mind where Ed Harris' character ""Bud"" is trying to revive Mary Mastrantonio(his wife in the movie, though they are separated) and hes screaming at her with all his being for to fight and not back down. Yeah that's what I want us both to feel. That we have something worth fighting for and that the hurting we are both feeling is an indicator of how much we love each other. This doesnt have to end our marraige. It MAY, but it doesnt HAVE to."	"Well, good luck with that. Your marriage isn't over yet. You are both going through alot right now. Hopefully you guys will give eachother closure when the time is right. Hang in there and don't give up just yet
Thank you, it's going to be an uphill battle but I'm not giving in. Just second guessing my choice at times. Then I remember how I felt before I decided to take this seriously, or more appropriately how little I felt..."	ftmzq5	trans	6	0.81	2020-04-02 14:10:37
My Tragic Backstory lol	I realized I was trans when I was 21. I came out as a man a little tentatively at 22. I wasn't confident or assertive about it, but I really tried to physically transition and took testosterone for almost a year. But I ran out and didn't have access anymore. I kinda mentally spiralled and went back in the closet. It wasn't hard because nobody in my life used my male name or pronouns. They actually just kinda ignored my coming out like it never happened, making me second guess myself and feel crazy. Everybody pretended it never happened for three years. Now I'm 27 and I've come back out to my friends, none of which live nearby but all of which are supportive. Now it's time to come out to my family who I actually see IRL. I know the mistake I made before was being a doormat and never correcting anyone. Now I'm just trying to mentally prepare myself to do this and do it confidently. I'm not expecting any overt anger or risk to my safety, mostly just disregarding my gender completely. Any advice on how to do it would be much appreciated since I'm starting to second guess if I really am so much stronger and more confident like I thought I was lol	"I 100% feel this post. I'm in different circumstances but the family aspect of things is definitely the toughest. 


Ideally, I would say if it's uncomfortable for them in the beginning, if you stand your ground and do you, maybe they'll come around and see you're happier, etc. and realize you're still you, just the most authentic version. 

I know family is like super fickle though sometimes, and coming from a primarily conservative, mostly religious family myself, it's definitely daunting, and something I am heavily thinking about myself right now. 

Whatever you decide to do, definitely good luck and I hope that you can find the best way to do what makes you happy.

Later thought: I feel like fear of family's reactions makes the waffling worse."	c9gjyd	trans	6	0.81	2019-07-05 14:27:05
Right Here, Right Now (126)	"All we have is this present moment. This moment right now is all that matters. I am very big on creating goals. Something I used to be so focused on though, is being obsessed with the **Destination, rather than the Journey.** The **Journey** is where everything is learned. The insecurities, the struggles, the pain, the sadness, the anger and everything in between.

Daily, I meditate, I get outside, I stretch, I write gratitude lists & know that the energy you put out, the Universe will give it right back 10 fold.

Everyday, its our chance to start something new. Everyday, we are given an opportunity to face our insecurities, our pain, our struggles. To take 1 step towards doing something daily that makes us feel uncomfortable. Through time, through daily work, we can heal, we can do more things than what we think that we are scared of.

In this moment, you are loved, you are cared for, you impact the ones around you but as well as the world.

**I love you.**

Questioning my gender is ruining my life (long detailed post... sorry)	"Hi everyone! I‚Äôve never posted to reddit before made an account because I feel as though I need to get in touch with others who‚Äôve been in the same position as me. 

So here‚Äôs the situation: I‚Äôm a 21 year old male from the UK, I have a long term girlfriend and consider myself straight. I am on a placement year at one of the big 4 accounting firms with a job offer waiting for me when I come back at the end of university which I am due to finish next year. 

Despite all of this, I‚Äôm in a total meltdown. I can‚Äôt stop questioning my gender. It‚Äôs completely ruining my ability to do basic pieces of work, get to sleep and function as a proper human being.

I have been questioning my gender for a long time, the majority of my primary school friends were female and I have always hated sports like football and rugby but loved badminton. When I was little I used to dress up all the time in superhero outfits, I asked one Christmas for a cat woman costume and cried when I opened it and it was batman. I used to hate going to football training and stuff and never went to play, I remember my dad used to go with my uncle to watch my cousin play and I would dream on nights that I had turned up gone into the changing rooms and come out a girl who was really good at football and my dad being really happy. 

Things stayed like this until around the age of 8/9. Avatar came out and I remember loving it, a totally imaginative world. I‚Äôd never seen anything like it, I imagined myself doing the transfer body thing to be a real girl in my dreams from then on until I hit puberty. 

I hit puberty and began to become really interested in girls. I used to search pretty girl etc into google images on a night and just stare at them for hours on end wishing I was one of them. I started google boy to girl in the hope it was possible and stumbled upon an article about Kim petras. Nothing has ever changed my life like this. I was immediately fascinated, it was everything I had wished for every Christmas and it was possible, the only problem was, I was absolutely terrified of telling anyone how I felt. I used to play a large amount of world of Warcraft and runescape with my guy friends from school and my sister, Id nearly always make female characters and tell them because it was due to the hit boxes being smaller and other assorted bullshit to evade them questioning me. This continued for some years.

Eventually I stumbled upon actual porn. Trans porn from reading a Wikipedia article about kimber James linked from google images. I used to masturbate to trans porn all the time and still do, my fetishes have never got any greater than just plain trans girl on guy porn. Sometimes I watch ultra feminine girls and sometimes more trap like girls. I feel like this has been a way I have just been coping with the fact I am trans for all these years. I have never found straight girl on guy porn as enticing, nor am I particularly interested in any of this sissy porn shit. I like the compilations of attractive girls and often the music but I hate the degrading ‚Äòyou are a faggot you must suck cock‚Äô captions they‚Äôre a total turn off.

I‚Äôm confused as shit though. I have been thinking about taking hormones for years. I told myself I would decide if I am or not by 20 never look back but I‚Äôm still deciding. I feel in everyday life absolutely fine, I have absolutely no social dysphoria. I also have absolutely no genital dysphoria as I‚Äôm not an enormous fan of P or V. Infact I‚Äôm almost glad I have a penis instead due to the fact I can have sex with my girlfriend. 

But I‚Äôm completely indifferent about my appearance. I feel as though my life would‚Äôve just been much happier if I was born female. I love women‚Äôs clothing compared to men‚Äôs, I buy my girlfriend clothes, shoes, and makeup all the time. I absolutely love female fashion and feel completely restricted and just outright awkward men‚Äôs clothes shopping. I love things like going to get nails and lashes and brows done with her but I can never take part. I am just outright confused about this, my body makes me feel completely disgusting when I do what I love, putting on a wig and makeup and jumpsuit to go out to a bar with my girlfriend. I just stand in the mirror feeling upset with my masculine features. I absolutely love romance too. I wish I could just greet my girlfriend at the door fully made up with a nice set of lingerie on but when I have attempted this in the past I have wimped out due to body insecurities. I have always wanted boobs since as long as I can remember. 
This whole situation scares me.

On the one hand I have had transgender thoughts since I was a kid and have a lot of female interests. But because I have lived as a guy for all these years the thought of changing my name and being called by female pronouns kind of weirds me out. After all I am a 21 year old male with a girlfriend in a good job and have a very male attitude with other guys, I go to the pub play,call of duty and gamble on football/horses. It sounds like some sort of complete mental breakdown.

Am I trans or some sort of dual gender? 
Although I don‚Äôt have genital dysphoria now, I imagine I would have if I transitioned due to me being unable to wear the clothes I want to? 
Will my sexuality change from hormones? 
Will I lose my ability to pleasure my gf? 
Will my family hate me? 
Will I be fired from my job? 
Can I keep taking hormones quiet until I feel personally comfortable that I will not look like a bad cross dresser? ( imagine this will take me 1-2 years) 

I have been suffering from really bad anger issues sometimes when I am thinking about this and stressing and someone interrupts my thoughts, will hormones fix this? 

I‚Äôm kind of sure I‚Äôm trans really really really  struggling to come to terms with it. I rang a children‚Äôs trans charity once when I was little to ask advice and hung up when someone picked up the phone. 

Does the fact that I have watched so much trans porn and I am also interested in plastic surgery/bimbofication a sign that this is some kind of AGP fetish? I get an erection sometimes at the thought of having boobs and a tanned body with long hair but I am torn whether this is excitement or some form of AGP? 

I‚Äôm honestly so grateful for anyone who‚Äôs read this far it‚Äôs unreal. I‚Äôm just really really struggling and really need some help and I really appreciate you taking the time!!"	"I struggled with the fear I was AGP for literally 2 decades. I assure you, it‚Äôs not only rare some psychologists don‚Äôt even think it exists. 

A great test is to start hormone blockers and light estrogen and see how you feel on it. If you are truly ‚Äúmale‚Äù then the sudden and sharp drop off of testosterone and sex drive will make you slam on the brakes. But if you are truly trans, the female brain when introduced to estrogen for the first time is a bit like running the engine on the right ‚Äúoctane‚Äù for the first time and it instantly starts functioning better. There‚Äôs so much more to it, but don‚Äôt struggle by yourself. Join a trans support group, meet others, find out what it‚Äôs like on the other side. 

Your story was a bit like reading an autobiography. *sigh*
Maybe you should start with crossdressing and dressing more feminine. Be honest with your girlftiend and let her know you want to express yourself more freely. Maybe that's why you feel so trapped.
I'm not going to pretend to know what you are feeling, I'm in an almost completely different situation, I'm a 15 year old trans girl living in the united states. Don't compare your dysphoria to other people, it's different, everyone's is different, and if anything, mine has just become more noticeable since I finally (less than a year ago) accepted myself as female. Sex drive has an interesting relationship with gender, for me at least. Over the course of the last year or two, I have lost most of mine, corresponding to when my dysphoria was getting stronger, but, it was present way before I had a strong sex drive, and continues to be present afterwards, I would not base your gender identity on it. I wanted to post something here, just because in life I want to help people in any way I can, even if it's just trying to offer some comforting words as a stranger with a large age gap, separated by a ocean. For a while I did have some similar stuff with transitioning, for some reason I would end up with an erection after putting on a skirt, but that disappeared within a month, and whats left is just the feeling that it is natural, and I always end up dreading when I have to change to go to school, or leave my room, or anything. I never realized how much male pronouns hurt me until this year, sometimes you don't notice unless things change. I'm not sure if i was a help at all, but I know how dysphoria feels, and it felt really good for me, the first time someone refereed to me as a girl.
I kind of know I am trans I just am struggling to come to terms with the whole change. I‚Äôve been a guy all my life and haven‚Äôt been depressed about it. I know I would be happier as a girl because I can be myself to a greater extent. I‚Äôve wanted to start hormones for years but the waiting list for the NHS is enormous so I will have to go privately. Additionally I‚Äôll have to speak to my GP and it‚Äôs a tiny practice my Aunty work at. She‚Äôd no doubt find out and tell everyone so I‚Äôll effectively have to come out to my parents to start.

I‚Äôm just really scared that I‚Äôm making the wrong decision out of fear of getting older. I‚Äôve been strongly considering telling my parents how I feel for years now but never got there. Every year goes by and I feel more like I‚Äôm losing my chance. 

I don‚Äôt necessarily dread guys clothes. I don‚Äôt like them and I hate cloth shopping for stuff for myself but it‚Äôs just that I much prefer the opposite. I feel as though the entire decision isn‚Äôt out of some sense of extreme dysphoria but just some preference for being the other gender. 

I‚Äôve lived 21 years as a guy and have done okay if you ignore the constant wishes to be the other gender. I feel as though I would get by with my thoughts if I choose not to transition but that if I do choose to transition I would be happier if this makes sense. I‚Äôm not depressed enough about it to put my future at risk. If transitioning means no wife and kids and struggling to find employment, part of me feels I should just try to forget it all and never look back though I know myself these feelings will come back and stronger.
Yes, I‚Äôve noticed this with so many. I‚Äôve since started my own business and I‚Äôm thriving.
I don't know how to respond in the context of of family, or work really, I want to go into the engineering field, I've always been aware that it will probably be hard to get into. Not only as trans, but as female. I don't know if this is good advice, but I wouldn't consider your future jobs in this decision, and, not sure what the exact laws in the UK are, but they can't fire/not hire you based on gender transition.

There is a process known as ‚Äúnesting‚Äù we do because we‚Äôre hitting pregnancy levels. It makes us want to cook, clean, make our living space nicer. Lots of dormant brain protocol that just ‚Äúclicks on‚Äù 

It‚Äôs really validating."	eou60l	trans	6	1.0	2020-01-15 00:12:54
I‚Äôm afraid to ask this but I need to understand so please don‚Äôt destroy me‚Ä¶	"I promise I‚Äôm going to ask my questions as respectfully as I can, and with my limited understanding I may get or say things wrong so please forgive me and hope you‚Äôll be willing to educate me without destroying me.

I‚Äôm a transwoman myself (7 months HRT) I only say that so some don‚Äôt think my ignorance is all due to ‚Äústraight cis‚Äù lack of understanding.

Alright, with all that said. I know it‚Äôs common to say cis confuse gender and sexuality a lot but is it fair to say some in the community do as well?

I have seen things say ‚ÄúSometimes I prefer to be X other times Y sometimes XY other times None and may even prefer myself and occasionally Z. It‚Äôs very confusing but that‚Äôs what Q gender is.‚Äù

Now not ridicule, make light or anything of that. But they sounds all like sexual preference and not a gender to me. It sounds like this person on the example just has sexual preferences that change (that‚Äôs fine!) but how is that a GENDER?

Another question, someone says ‚ÄúI‚Äôm female but sometimes I feel like a male and will dress like a man but I‚Äôm still a woman however others other times I dress like a man but want to be addressed as a man even though I‚Äôm female, then times I‚Äôll be an overly feminine woman but want to be identified as a woman so it‚Äôs really confusing but that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm X gender and need to be addressed properly depending as I change multiple times a day.‚Äù

Again not trying to be disrespectful, that just sounds really really confusing and I don‚Äôt understand how that‚Äôs a GENDER either. That to me (only my opinion) sounds like someone who of simply confused on finding themselves and wants to explore (perfectly fine!) until they figure themselves out. But to call all that a gender I find questionable.

I‚Äôm not trying at all to invalidate anyone!! But I started to feel in this community unless one is nothing but support and no ‚Äúnegative‚Äù questions you‚Äôre not welcome and down voted to hell like a stupid bigot. Which really seems like an echo chamber.

Which all got me to thinking some of these ‚ÄúTransphobes‚Äù manning the same one joke could some SOME of it be because they‚Äôre confused as hell on understanding as they don‚Äôt get explanations they just get yelled at and sometimes the people themselves can‚Äôt properly explain it (if you can‚Äôt properly explain something don‚Äôt be mad if it‚Äôs not understood properly). And the instant anger for just simply misgendering, they will apologize and still get their head ripped off. I would be pissed to and say fuck it as well. It‚Äôs hard when someone clearly looks like a man/woman undeniably and people are just supposed to know how to address you? People want to identify as clowns, non humans, things as genders ) every example I‚Äôve used is from TikTok or YouTube) that‚Äôs not genders to me. Want to called a clown? Ok, sure. But being a clown is not a gender.

It‚Äôs stuff like that where I start to see why the attack helicopter joke and the xhgdsukknb26 gender jokes still at around. Its from a lack of understanding, proper communications and explanations on both sides (yes I know some people are just shit/toxic people on both sides.)

I‚Äôm going to go down in flames like the Hindenburg but I don‚Äôt feel gender is a spectrums don‚Äôt feel there are so many genders and I feel the people who say others don‚Äôt understand the difference between sexuality and gender don‚Äôt understand it themselves sometimes.

Here goes‚Ä¶ I think there is male, female, and non binary (including trans). Anything else is sexual preferences or something else all together. Last one if you don‚Äôt want to have an intimacy in your relationship ok, how is that a gender? That‚Äôs a sexual preference is it not?

So if you actually read all of this, thank you. I hope that it can actually be the start of a dialogue not an attack fest and I hope I‚Äôm not the only who feels this way"	"It sounds like you are stuck, trying to understand things that you cannot relate to, that you have no frame of reference to.

As an example, for me, I cannot relate to the concept of asexuality. I have a hard time imagining what it would be like to not experience sexual attraction\*. It is really easy to then say that ace doesn't exist, instead of listening to people describe their own experience and their own understanding. You have to take their word for it.

Another example, if you are binary, it might be difficult for you to relate to the feelings and experiences that a genderfluid person has. This is just because you don't have a frame of reference, you have nothing to compare it to from your own experiences. That doesn't mean it doesn't exist.

Also, thinking everything else beyond male, female and nonbinary is sexual preferences is tying gender to sexuality. They do relate in some way, but the gender kinda defines the sexuality. When I thought I was a cis man, I was straight (attracted to women), now that I identify femme (loosely demigirl), that would make me a lesbian (attracted to women). My gender informs the label I use for my sexuality, my attraction.

Also, keep in mind that labels are a communication tool. They help people understand each other with a couple words instead of having to have an hour long conversation every time you meet somebody new (gender and sexuality is complicated and nuanced). New labels will come about, old labels will fall out of use. Some labels are just an umbrella term that is less precise (i.e. trans or nonbinary).

\* as I am not ace, hopefully I'm not being disrespectful in my comparison here. Please let me know if I'm off base.
I know I‚Äôm trying to understand and stuck because the answers are all over the place and even when coherent like your answer. It still doesn‚Äôt actually answer my question or address the issues I have.

But I do appreciate you trying and being respectful.
Gender is complex. There are hundreds of genders (labels) because there are that many _common_ experiences where enough people can come together and at least partly agree on a definition of that label. You aren't going to be able to understand a large number of them. If you go into academics, research, philosophy and/or psychology, then you might understand more over time.

It is ok to not understand, to not have the answers. Just trust people that they know what their own internal feelings and experiences are.
I trust what people say they feel, that‚Äôs them and I ain‚Äôt here to take away that. But I also think it is fair that there should be proper explanations and consistent explanations if as a community we expect those outside of it looking in to understand it as well.

Like with anything if the only explanations is trust me or that‚Äôs just how I feel then it‚Äôs not entirely fair to get mad at people for not understanding or hearing multiple answers for the same term.

If people try to learn but feel the answer doesn‚Äôt satisfy their way of learning they get frustrated which depending on the person can turn into disinterest, mockery, anger, and or hate.

Not talking about the people who have no true interest in learning or understanding and just use that as a cover to hate anyway"	pauf87	trans	6	0.88	2021-08-24 19:30:29
Family drama	"Hello everyone, I am reaching out because I am at a loss for what to do and don't know where to turn to. I have been transitioning through hrt for about a year and a quarter, and have been out as trans for nearly 3 years. My family albeit slow to accept finally started coming around as my own sceptic of a mother is now referring to me by my correct pronouns and name (minus the occasional slipups.) Still a lot of progress, however I wouldn't be reaching out like this if there wasn't an issue, and that issue is my brother. The moment I came out I got 3 separate reactions from each family member; My mom acted in shock and worry that I was making the right choice, My father who proceeded to silently storm out of the room thankfully unconfrontational, and then was my brother who immediately replied with ""You were my big brother I looked up to you but now I am disappointed in you"" before angerly storming out of the room.  Fast forward to now where my father is making an attempt to come to terms with it, my mother is oddly supportive and even treats me as a daughter now, however my brother still refuses to see me as the correct gender he will refuse to acknowledge me as female and when I try tactics such as pleading or even give him the silent treatment till he greets me correctly he still refuses.  Much of the time when I complain and inform him I am female now he replies with a ""I don't  care"" or a ""no you're not"" Its emotionally draining and I am not sure what to do, at this point I'm considering avoiding him completely not accepting him as family until he accepts me for me, is this the right decision to make or would it be a mistake? Please help."	"Just ignore him I‚Äôd say you can cut contact asap

I came out as trans to my mom yesterday	"I‚Äôm 19, 6ft, trans mtf so it feels too late to do anything about it but I just wanted her to know atleast, she was surprised and said ‚ÄúI support you, for who you are.‚Äù Which immediately made me regret when I told my sisters and dad at 15, my sisters supported me, my dad said it was a puberty thing that I should get over at some point, my frames too large, and I‚Äôll be subjecting myself to treatments I don‚Äôt understand. 

His points were valid, however they were arguable but I didn‚Äôt say anything and accepted it as what I needed to hear, so I closed myself off from a lot of people and LGBTQ groups cause I was scared to be myself. I have to let go of a lot of regret and anger now cause times changed and I‚Äôve already lost so many opportunities to change, so I might as well try. Though I‚Äôll always have these words setting my mind on fire, ‚Äúyour frames too large‚Äù, I was 15 and it was a lie to make me stop considering ‚Äúsuch things‚Äù. Now it‚Äôs true so I really don‚Äôt see myself becoming a pretty woman, but I figure trying would still lead to a more fulfilling life of truth."	">feels too late to do anything about it

Honey, I'm almost 40, 6'3"" and started HRT two months ago. Its never too late to start living your best life. I know I don't pass (yet) and maybe I never will, but I'm living my best life and have never been happier. 

Best of luck on your journey. You have plenty of time to make the changes you want to make. Keep it up girl, and if your family doesn't support you find people who will. It makes all the difference.
One thing you could strive for is a built tall chick who could beat a bully up or a chick viking juggernaut. 
When you take estrogen your muscles develop in the same way as a AFAB so if you build a little mucle it will fit the frame really well

That's my goal at least
When I was your age I also thought it was too late for me. I ended up not coming out to anyone and trying to keep living as a guy. Now I'm 8 years older and starting my transition even later. This way of thinking has only cost me time, made me live a miserable life while trying to act like I was a man and exposed my body to testosterone for longer. 
It's not too late and it will never be. You don't have to transition if you don't want to, but you being ""too late"" should never be a reason not to."	utzmnv	trans	5	0.86	2022-05-20 15:34:40

I haven't visited my dad in over a year and a half and last time it was only for 4 days. They know we're not conservative but that's about it. We don't talk politics with ANYONE, not even other democratic leaning people. In our minds there's no room for political talk among friends unless you're wanting to end a friendship.

Anyway, we've been here a week and my wife is in boy mode right now. I'm using they/them pronouns and am using her preferred name around my dad and stepmom, but they only understand the name as a nickname as that's what my wife has requested since she's not out yet. This has been very hard for me because her preferred pronouns are she/her, even in boy mode, but I'm doing my best.

My stepmom also has a trans niece who has just finished her last SRS operation and has been out and transitioning for 5 years now. And while she does seem to try to use her correct pronouns and name, she still deadnames her with other family and even my dad says things like ""Mom's nephew got a sex change"" AND I JUST CAN'T DEAL!!!!

I finally stormed out saying I can't be around people who aren't inclusive and my wife sat their patiently and was sort of able to explain why things they were saying were not ok. My stepmom was complaining about how she hates that she can't call herself a woman anymore or some stupid shit like that.

How is it that I can't deal with transphobic terfs but my wife can? I've always been the hothead of the two of us, but she said she simply felt disappointed in them, but not surprised. I, on the other hand, am appalled and I'm shaking with anger right now. They called me a few minutes later and said they weren't trying to be insensitive, but I explained that it didn't seem like they were trying to be inclusive either.

They had fox news on in the background too and have complained about how they can't watch the news when we're visiting because we won't come inside and hang out with them while Tucker is on the tv... duh! They wouldn't just sit around quietly listening to the opposite!

This visit is harder than any visit before and it doesn't feel good to be here. And I'm not even trans!

I'ma punch a bitch!

End rant/vent (wife approved of this post)."	You can‚Äôt take it because you care. That‚Äôs really sweet. Your wife is probably a bit more used to it. We get it all the time, but we see people change, too. Some people do come around when it‚Äôs explained to them, but.. Fox News and other reactionary media have a strange, almost brain-washing effect on people. Almost makes you feel bad for them.	n9m633	trans	7	0.82	2021-05-11 01:58:31
Hello	"I'm new here and this is my first time posting on reddit. Here's a bit about me:

* Originally (?) F, currently closeted M
* I'm looking for a new name so any help is appreciated :) (Preferably gender-neutral or male)
* I have a bit of anxiety and extreme anger issues
* Straight (seeing as I identify myself as male and am dating a female)

But that's enough about me, how are you doing?"	"[deleted]
Howdy! I‚Äôm also a closeted FTM lol (except to like, three people). I‚Äôm bi tho and my name that I‚Äôve chosen for myself thus far is Dustin :)
Hi! I‚Äôm bonni, MTF 14, and closeted forever lol. My Christian parents would kill me if they found out. I suffer from ADD, ADHD, and autism, so yikes. I‚Äôm pretty sure I‚Äôm pansexual(???) I think. 

But that‚Äôs enough about me, how are you doing?
Heya, my name is lily and im having a good day, what about you? Also what do you think about the name Alex? I think it is neutral.
Hello Rachel, I'm glad to hear at least some people know! But, don't drop family contact right away, wait for their reaction first. Who knows, maybe they'll support you all the way!
Hi Dustin! I'm glad to hear some people know about your transition, it's always nice to know people have your back.
Hi Bonni, I like your name! I currently don't have one that I like, but that's fine. I'm doing decent, you?
That's good to hear Lily! And I do like the name Alex, thanks for sharing!
Yeah, it makes me feel less alone (it‚Äôs my best friend, boyfriend and mom that know). I would be totally out but uh, 1) I live in Arkansas and 2) my dad would flip and I‚Äôm not exactly financially independent yet aaaaaand I don‚Äôt wanna risk my wellbeing in any way. Like dysphoria sucks and I wanna be myself (as do we all) but I know he won‚Äôt react well and I don‚Äôt know how bad it would be so I don‚Äôt wanna risk it (which my mother agrees with)."	mjzhdb	trans	6	0.8	2021-04-04 16:26:39
trans people who have started or fully transitioned, how old were you?	"some background, i'm transgender ftm. i'm in high school, closeted to my religious immigrant parents, terrified to come out to them. i probably wont even be able to cut my hair short until i'm 18, along with starting testosterone and surgeries and stuff.

this really upsets me. i'm angered that my teenage years are being ruined by dysphoria, no matter how hard i try to look on the bright side. so i'm wondering, how old were you when you first started transitioning? i just need some reassurement that its okay to not start transitioning in your teenage years, even though it really sucks ass.

along with that it hurts so bad seeing my other trans friends getting hair cuts, binders, starting hrt, even though i'm happy for them. how do i put my feelings aside and uplift them?"	"Heyo, I started socially transitioning when I was about 17, didn‚Äôt start medically transitioning until a couple of days before my 20th (though that was more dumb waiting times than lack of support). But I know guys who have transitioned in their 40s or 50s or older, there is no objective ‚Äúright time‚Äù to transition üíô whenever it is safe and right for you in your personal situation is your ‚Äúright time‚Äù to transition. It is never too late to be who you are, and I wish you all the love and luck in the world while you wait for that right time and the same for your life when you finally get on that road üíôüíôüíôüíô

Edit because I totally didn‚Äôt see the second question lmao: it‚Äôs really difficult to put your own feelings aside. I know I never managed it, especially when I had friends younger than me way further on in their transition than I was. There isn‚Äôt really a ‚Äòhow to‚Äô for it, but you don‚Äôt need to put your feelings aside to uplift other people. You can feel a little jealous and dysphoric and still be their number one supporter, it just takes a little time to learn how to balance the two üòä
61. Late starter. Big regrets. Start asap. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
I came of age in the early ‚Äò00s and had a similar situation with religious parents. I was also in a tiny town in a red state with no access to mental healthcare. I didn‚Äôt start transitioning until I was twenty-three because I felt I had to move to a more liberal area for safety. It sucked and seemed like I wasted a lot of time, but it was okay in the end. 

Only you can decide what is best for you, but in the meantime I suggest you try meditation as a way to stay calm and not spend every second thinking about transitioning. [The Mind Illuminated](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/25942786) gives step-by-step instructions on how to meditate and may be helpful for you. 

It will get better. Hang in there and know that you‚Äôre future is bright and internet strangers are rooting for you!
Started at age 42. Wish I‚Äôd had the courage to start earlier.
Starting in my 30s. :-)  
I wish I would have had the courage to start earlier, but I don‚Äòt think this is too bad. Times were quite different then. I didn‚Äòt have the means to do much and didn‚Äòt even know where to find help, let alone speak to other people like me.   
I‚Äôm happy I can transition in my country and I‚Äôm happy there is a better life ahead of me now. There is no use in ruminating over my ‚Äûlost years‚Äú or the missed opportunity for t to affect my bones and help me grow a little more.  What‚Äòs done is done.  

If you have the possibility and feel safe doing so, I would try to reach out and find help earlier in life, because most places offer better help nowadays than back when I was a kid. Other trans folks can direct you to trans-friendly healthcare.  
But don‚Äòt feel bad if you don‚Äòt have this safety. Not everyone does. You can totally take your time and start when you have more control over your own life. :-)  
In the mean time, you can still talk to orher trans, share what frustrates you or exchange advice on ways to include small gender affirming things in your daily life. You don‚Äòt need to feel alone, because you‚Äòre not.
I think most of us will wish we started younger. Ultimately, I think transitioning before puberty would be best. I didn‚Äôt start transitioning until I was 35. And at this point, I realize that I‚Äôll be transitioning for the rest of my life. Don‚Äôt worry about it too much. Just get to it when you can, however you can.
I am also ftm. Started when I was 20 and I began with surgeries first bc my biggest problem was the period. Have not yet started HRT because of my health&family problems but anyway I think the day I started transitioning was the best day of my life.
I started when I was 49. I'm now 66 and life couldn't be better.
thank you so much for replying ‚ù§ can i ask some questions about your families reactions to your transition? i have a large extended family, all of them religious and transphobic, and i want to mentally prepare myself
My family is pretty small and I don't have much contact with them, so it sounds like you're going to have a lot more drama than I did. For me it was just my mom, dad, and brother. My mom was really sweet about it and gave me all sorts of daughter advice, which was pretty heart warming. But she's also petty, and I'm pretty sure bipolar, so when she's in a mood she's not above using it to hurt me. My dad is old and messes up my name a lot, but almost instantly corrects himself. It's been years, so I have to accept that this is as good as it's going to get. My brother is not a kind person, and we didn't have a good relationship before I transitioned, so he says my name with scorn as if he's mocking me. 

But at this point in my life, I've married, and have a family of my own. My blood family is about four thousand miles away. It is what it is. It's perfectly possible to find your chosen family and develop meaningful relationships that can make life a little less rough. Good luck to you on your path!"	q0bd0k	trans	6	1.0	2021-10-03 05:18:39
My dad was being transphobic again, i can barely stand it	"**WARNING: suicidal thoughts, cussing, transphobia, mental abuse, mentioning physical abuse**

My dad was was talking about how ‚ÄúThe age of innocence is so low nowadays‚Äù as he said and i ignored him because i didnt want to hear it. But he went on anyways and talked about how my cousin (lets just say his name is Jim) was talking about all the trans people in his class. And my dad says ‚ÄúWhy are little kids thinking about who they want to have >!sex!< with!‚Äù And i of course having my anger issues replied with ‚Äúwhat?? Being trans has nothing to do with who you want to have >!sex!< with!‚Äù And my dad insisted that it did saying something about how trans people are just finding ways to be gay in a different way. And i said ‚ÄúTrans people have nothing to do with gay people, they get grouped together as one because they are persecuted for being themselves‚Äù and he said ‚ÄúNo one even knows what trans is‚Äù Thats clearly wrong, you rarely walk into someone on the street that doesn‚Äôt know what trans is, it happens but usually with very young or old people. So i scoffed at what he said because he was pissing me off. He then says some stupid joke about trans people and i say ‚Äúoh god are you gonna start making attack helicopter jokes now?‚Äù 

He immediately started threatening to hurt me, and that i need to stop acting like the center of the universe. He then walks off saying i have no respect and im always being a >!bitch.!<

I can barely >!fucking!< stand this house. I cant ever come out as a trans guy *here*. Id only be invalidated and mentally abused, and probably physically now that i think about it. 

I need to get outa here, but i dont know how because today my mom told me we‚Äôre moving in the summer and i need to start packing. I just got settled at my high school, got a partner, friends. I thought i‚Äôd spend the rest if my childhood here but no im going to be ripped away from every >!fucking!< reason to not kill myself. If i cant be with my real >!fucking!< family then i am going to go crazy. This supposed ‚Äúfamily‚Äù i have is destroying every single possible escape, and survive. Im going to >!fucking!< lose it, im sorry that i cant be normal girl why cant i just be a girl but instead im this. >!Shit!< im shaking so much right now, i cant stop crying please give me advice. Anything, take my mind off it, say anything to make me stop feeling like this please."	"If you're a minor please call children's protective services because your father is abusive.

Also being trans has nothing to do with sex. I've had gender dysphoria since 1978 and I'm ace. Some people are trans who are attracted to the gender opposite of their birth gender which means if they don't transition they're technically straight.
Yeah if he's threatening to hurt you that's not okay, plain and simple. It might seem scary at first but I promise long term it's probably for the best
What so i can be put in an orphanage? Farther from my friends and partner?? How would that help?
You can do your own research, but they don't just rip you out and send you off somewhere else, esp not at your age if you are in high-school. What's your relationship with your mom like?
Decent edging on hatred.
You may just have to ride it out for now depending on your age. You don't deserve to be mistreated but they wouldn't put you in an orphanage (depending on what country you live in.)

Do you have any relatives or friends you can stay with that are more accepting? Depending where you live most places you can move out at 16 and your parents can't call the cops to force you home.

I'm not saying run away but if there is a place you can go, grandparents and aunt or uncle or something then that may be an option.
My immidiate family is more supportive than the restof my family and as you can see its barely. I plan on riding it out until im 18 then moving out immediately"	t8cw08	trans	8	0.99	2022-03-07 00:42:04
dont know if im trans or just hate being perceived as a woman	"title might be a bit confusing, sorry. ive been identifying as transmasc for a little while now but i just saw a tiktok that was a reading of a reddit post where op outlined all the shit women face in their daily lives and i had the thought that ""am i really transmasc or do i feel this way because this is how women are treated and i dont want to be treated that way."" the video was so depressing and anger inducing because since im afab and was raised as a woman i know that everything in the post is true. im so tired and sad. im so sad yall. can i please get some advice? thoughts, experiences?"	"well do you like being a woman but dont want to be treated poorly for that? or do you not feel like a woman? because women like being women, they just dont like misogyny
when im not uncomfortable i dont feel anything about it tbh. being socially perceived as a woman normally doesnt make me feel one way or the other, maybe because i am very aware of what i look like so it ""fits"" my image? my discomfort tends to stem from my physical appearance and voice. i dont really like looking like a woman, but right now i cant tell if its because i dont want to be sexualized or because im actually trans. although i genuinely think i would look better if i had a more masculine/androgynous figure. ive never thought i felt like a woman either, but not in a ""i feel like a man"" sort of way; i didnt think about it at all. it just wasnt a thing that crossed my brain. none of my emotions about the whole thing got me to pay attention to it until recently bc its always been a feeling of unidentifiable discomfort.
to be fair, ""not being a woman"" doesn't inherently mean being a man! gender is complicated & often more fluid than people realize.
when youre alone and you look at yourself in a nonsexual way how do you feel about your body? when you are receiving ***wanted, consensual*** sexual attention, do you feel good about your body? do you not want any sexual attention ***because*** of your body? these are all things you should think about. your comment about wanting to be more androgynous seems like a nonbinary or maybe trans masc thing. but only you can know that. take time to think about these things more in debth"	x15jhd	trans	6	0.88	2022-08-30 01:11:16
Being transgender has been one of the best and worst things in my life.	"This might sound like a confusing tittle but i just wanted to rant and express some of my feelings lately. My English is not perfect and i might not be the best at expressing my thoughts so sorry for anything that ends up being a bit confusing.

&#x200B;

I just wanted to start by saying, being a part of this whole community is actually really wholesome, I've never felt so good around a community as i have with this specific community, and being trans has been the best thing that has happened to me and my life it has made me aware of so many memories and little things of my life that i never understood, why i never felt good when being told to ""Be a man"" or ""Act like a boy"", when i was told that ""Pink is a color for girls and you are a boy"", all that anger, confusion and in general the feelings that i never understood why existed in that moment are now obvious, I'm not a boy, i don't want to be one and i don't want to act like one and I've never been one.

&#x200B;

Its hard for me to describe how good this long process of discovering and understanding who am i, why I'm i like that and why I've felt the way I've felt my whole life, its lovely that i can share my experiences with other people like me and that I've been mostly accepted in my social circle except by sadly my own parents who cant seem to even remotely accept it, but coming back to the main topic. Even though this has been an amazing journey its getting harder and harder to keep those good feelings up.

&#x200B;

It has gotten to the point that it is almost impossible to open a news/social media app without being bombarded by anti trans legislation news, transphobia, genocidal ideologies. It is amazing that we have been able to create this relatively small community and make it such a safe and great place for everyone but even though I'm not even living in the us or any of these big transphobic places its just mentally taxing to hear about these ideologies and ideas every day of my life while I've never done any harm to anyone and i just want to live my life. I want to believe that im not the only one that feels like this and I know that in general I've always had trouble with keeping up with the sadly pesimistic world we live in beacuse it takes a huge tax on my mental health but It has gotten to a point where it just feels awful to just feel constantly attacked by others when I've never actually done anything wrong to anyone i wont ever do it, I've never ""imposed"" anything on anyone and all im asking is to be able to live a happy life like everyone that does no harm deserves to.

&#x200B;

Thanks for anyone that read the whole thing, i just felt like a needed to rant a little about the constant attacks on our community and how that affects me personally. Also thanks to everyone in this community It is so nice to see so many people that are ""Like me!"", and the whole vibe of this and many other subreddits just makes my day better. (I know this was probably an unnecessarily long post and im sorry for any misunderstandings because of my poor-ish english)."	"Yeah, I used to look at the news every morning but now I come here.

Just wanted to hear your thoughts about this...	"Hello everyone, I never discussed this with anyone and I feel it is time to take this out of my chest. I've always been perceived as a female. My parents, especially my mother, are kind of obssessed with the fact that I'm a female (my mother really wanted to have a girl). When I was a kid they made me attend ballet lessons (which I hated) and tried very hard to make me fit in among other girls. I never really felt a strong connection with my feminine side. I remember a time when I would just cry and beg my mother to take me out of the ballet lessons, the swimming lessons, the sewing lessons... I was a very insecure child. I took criticism very seriously, always trying to please my parents and my family. I thought my life would be literally me being some sort of character that I control, just like in a videogame, someone who isn¬¥t me but I wish the best. I used to attend a private school with nuns, very religious and strict. I didn't like playing with girls. Both girls and boys used to bully me a lot since I was ""weird"". I tried to fit it in but it just didn¬¥t feel right. I ended up isolating myself. I became a huge fan of fantasy, especially lotr at the time, so I just lived in my fantasy world, away from reality. I had a few male friends, those nerdy boys who were, just like me, insecure about hanging around the more sporty guys.

When I started hitting puberty and went to public school everything just got worse. I really hated the idea of me becoming a woman, I hated my body and my personality and everything around it. I didn¬¥t even feel any sort of attraction to guys at the time. I didn¬¥t feel like I was a lesbian tho, I imagined myself just being a guy. I became extremely antisocial, had no friends, developed a ed and became extremely depressed. I used to stand out as one of the best students at my school (I was around 14 at the time) but, since I was literally starving myself (i didn¬¥t want to have any feminine curves and it was also a form of ""discipline"") everything got worse and worse. I was very anxious about leaving the house and doing normal stuff like that(The pandemic actually helped me a bit to calm down. Anger attacks were frequent. I remember going to a psychiatrist who medicated me at the time. Very religious doctor, dind't solve anything). Then, when I was 16, I started my first real relationship. I already tried to speak to girls but I was too insecure and things did not go as planned. I had some disappointing experiences. I'm not good at speaking to females.

My first relationship was with a guy, he was 22 years old a the time. We started chatting online as friends, then he found out I was a girl. I was extremely vulnerable at the time. I started to slowly change since I met him. I gained weight, my period came back, I sort of started developing again. I was happy to have someone to talk to. He also has his issues. Extremely depressed, national-socialist and homophobic, even though he¬¥s secretly bissexual. My parents hate him for some reasons and I sort of hate him too. I tried to break up with him several times but I just can¬¥t manage to let him go. He is the only person I can share some of my thoughts. We don¬¥t even have sex for about a year, I'm always trying to avoid it. We still meet in secret (since my mother hates him) just to hang out sometimes and go to concerts. Sometimes I¬¥m really shitty to him but I know he won¬¥t leave me, even if I treat him badly.

Honestly, I'm rather pretty as a female. I'm quite tall (1.82m) and have expressive big eyes and a feminine body, elegant but rather strong. I also have very long hair (I really enjoy having long hair. I belive that liking metal influences a little bit). I know I'm not ugly or anything, I just try o accept myself but it¬¥s hard sometimes. I always wear the most basic and neutral clothes I can find and it¬¥s really an issue to find stuff that I like and my mother approves(even if I'm 18, I¬¥m still very dependent on her, since I live in her house and she pays for college. She's constantly criticising me and my behaviour and my style, just because I don't live up to her expectations, even if I'm one of the best students in my course and always stay out of trouble. She just wants me to socialise, wear some feminine clothes, go to parties, have some female friends and find a decent boyfriend).

Right now I'm in college, have no friends, still have a lot of insecurities and don't know what to do about my ""boyfriend"". I feel like I have no reason for anything, just feel very empty. Having good grades doesn¬¥t even satisfy me anymore. I feel like I¬¥m wasting my life, all of it just seems meaningless and dull, even if it's not that terrible, I mean, I¬¥m not dying or anthing like that . I'm just sick of pretending but I can't figure out any other alternatives to what I'm currently doing.

 Thank you for your patience, have a nice day :)"	"I think you have a lot of things you need to unpack with a therapist. Some of the things you said make me think you may be on the spectrum/autistic, especially sense you don‚Äôt feel like you get along or fit in with guys or girls and have trouble making friends.
Since you're posting in here, I assume you're wondering about your gender. One thing I will say is that with life if you want something to be different you have to do something different. So, try dressing and acting like a man (or however you think you might identify) and see how that feels.

Generally, the idea is to just be yourself. It sounds like you've been acting feminine to meet others expectations. How would you be/act if those expectations weren't there? Try living that way.
A person who is 22 has no legitimate reason to be dating a person who is 16. He also expresses seriously concerning philosophies. You are in an abusive relationship, and you need to get out.

As far as gender goes, yes, a lot of what you say resonates with my own trans experience, though coming from the opposite direction. If it‚Äôs something you want to explore more about yourself, you should! Self love is the most radical decision you can make, and it‚Äôs good to be radical.
Re: your relationships, everyone needs to learn how to stick up for themselves in life. And doing so doesn't have to destroy relationships. Give it a try.
A person who is 22 and dating a 16 year old is a legitimate predator. You can make excuses for him, but that is simply not ok and he took advantage of you in your vulnerable state. It's completely understandable why your parents don't like him. 

It sounds like you have a lot of pressure on you to be a certain way. Just remember, other people's expectation of you do not define you. It sounds to me like you either need to have a serious confrontation with your mother and explain how she is making things worse for you, or if you don't feel like you are able to confront her you need to put some serious distance between yourselves until you can figure some things out. 

If you are able I also highly recommend seeking a mental health professional. This isn't something you should have to deal with on your own, and it doesn't sound like you have a very good support system around you. You have some serious stuff to work through, and it sounds like you just need someone who can be helpful and supportive instead of the current manipulative forces in your life. 

This is a really tough situation, but you can get through it and be better for it. I just really encourage you to find some help through this, it will be much harder to tackle alone.
>Some of the things you said make me think you may be on the spectrum/autistic

This !!! Recently found out I was autistic, and I have a feeling OP might be too.
When I was little, around 4/5 years old my teachers thought I was autistic since I didn't interact a lot. My parents took me to various therapists. Some said I was ""too intelligent "" and imaginative to be autistic. Then one of the therapists said that I probably had hearing problems, which I fact I had, that's why I didn't talk much at the time. Then I had a hard time learning how to speak and write properly again (I had surgery when I was 7). Idk if I'm autistic or not, but in fact I have a hard time communicating
Thank you for your advice! My mother is really controlling so it is difficult to buy more masculine clothes, for example. I know that I'm technically an adult, but according to her I'm still dependent on her, so I need to conform to her rules. I end up wearing almost the same stuff everyday. I always try to pick some stuff from the men's section haha. 
I think I just need to open myself up a little bit. I'm just awkward when it comes to interactions. The way I behave wouldn't change much if I suddenly appeared to be a man, I believe
My ""boyfriend "" was, and still is, stuck in his teenage years. He's a complete loser. I just got addicted to talking to him at the time, just like him. I believe he loves me but not in a healthy way. He's very lonely and is completely obssessed over me. He helped me to distract myself from some of my thoughts, otherwise I don't know where I would be rn. He knows perfectly that no decent girl would want a guy like him, with a weak mind and a fat body (he just got fatter and fatter when our relationship started going down). We just used each other. He wanted to know how it is to have a girlfriend. I wanted to see a male's body up close. Indeed I need to get out. I'm just afraid that he'll stalk me...
Good morning,
My ""boyfriend "" and I sort of used each other. At the time he had lost his only parental figure, his grandfather and was completely devastated. He was really unstable, almost always high. I was also in my lowest at the time. I was really dumb and stupid, not eating does that to a person! 
The thing was not completely consensual I have to admit it. But I also satisfied my need to see a male body up close.
My mother used to trust me until I became a teen and my personality started to really develop. It was terrible. All that controlling was too much. She would control my weight (Since she noticed me losing weight), control my phone, change me from school to school when she felt like doing so. Once she saw a phone notification of a girl messaging me so she broke my phone:) (I was 15 at the time). Had no privacy. 
Everything was only getting worse so she just took me to therapy. I wasn't able to express my feelings because I knew the therapist was very religious and would just spill it all out to my mother. I just got antidepressants.
Nowadays I'm way better, not because of therapy, I just matured a lot more. 
Therapy is not taken very seriously in my country and is often too expensive. Often therapists take advantage of dumb and spoiled teens that just come to tell stupid dramas instead of actually helping those in need. 
For now I'll try to figure things out by myself. 
Thanks for your response. It's a bit weird to share this things but it definitely feels nice to do so anonymously
Also, I had a few male friends but the things didn't work very well for various reasons, but mostly due to the fact that some guys just get feelings for me. They all get crazy when a ""girl"" knows more metal bands than them haha
You might get some blowback but when you start to assert yourself, you'll she that she's not the boss of you.
> Indeed I need to get out. I‚Äôm just afraid that he‚Äôll stalk me‚Ä¶

Well, luckily, that‚Äôs something I have experience with personally. [Here is an absolutely fantastic resource to start with.](https://crimethinc.com/2020/08/26/doxcare-prevention-and-aftercare-for-those-targeted-by-doxxing-and-political-harassment) It‚Äôs specifically targeted to activists, so not everything will be applicable, but you can consider how it can be reframed to your personal situation.

I‚Äôm a survivor of an abusive marriage, I know how scary it is. You can do this.
I don't know where you live, but you need to understand this. He was an adult and you were a child (yes 16 is still a child). In many countries in the world and over a dozen US states this would not only be frowned upon, but also illegal. It sounds like he used you in a way that is absolutely inappropriate and you need to cut all ties with this person.
Well, I seriously thought about living by myself but it would be almost impossible. In my country is practically impossible to rent a decent room, afford to eat and pay for college with a part-time job. I already tried to slowly do things my way, but she just gets very annoying, constantly yelling, extremely rude. She's not in the best state of mind. My parents got divorced in 2020 and she just can't get over it. Also, my father and I are getting along way better (because I'm having good grades basically) but I know I can't count on him on this matter. He's cold and distant. Not good to talk about feelings. He's kind of an asshole sometimes. I just want to finish college and get out of this situation, I focus on that
I'll take a look at it. Thanks a lot!
The age of consent in my country (Portugal) is 14 years  old, but it is considered ""taking advantage"" of a minor if an adult has sex with a minor from 14 to 16 years old. This is not taken too seriously especially if you are a female, 16 years old and don't look very much like a child. 
I understand your point but what is done is done. 
I know I have to get rid of him. Tried countless times. I'm just afraid to be alone ig. Sometimes I think that only with him I have the chances to have fun and do the things that I like. It's really boring to be always by myself and I find it hard to find new friends. 
Thank you for your honesty. You're definitely right
I understand being afraid of being alone, but you deserve to be with someone who is good for you and not taking advantage of you. Also as someone who has been in a long time relationship and is now single, being alone can really help with figuring yourself out and growing as an individual. The most important thing is that you take care of yourself!"	10p5g0p	trans	7	1.0	2023-01-30 15:22:28
1230 rant	Hey all, its 1230am and I feel like ranting. I feel angry and I WANT to feel angry. I feel lonely. I have friends and family, all of whom have openly or at least tentatively supported my transition. I have friends and a partner who love me and I love them. It's pretty fucking great. They fill me the fuck up. But I'm angry anyways. I'm angry because I don't want to live this same kind of life anymore. I don't want to just watch TV or play video games. I don't want to try and keep in touch with my family who won't make the effort to call me. I don't want to be a dick but it takes so much effort to keep in touch and hang with all these INDIVIDUALS who want to keep doing the same shit we've always done and I just want to be by myself. I have my own desires and ambitions that don't seem to mesh with them. I want to say fuck it to all of them, see what happens if I make people reach out or come to me. It feels selfish as fuck. But anger is supposed to be a sign that some boundary of mine is being broken, but I don't know which. I need a trans community. I need a creative community. I need a fucking community! Not just individual friends who don't interact with each other. And I need to move my body. I don't want to just sit and shoot the shit, I want to MOVE. I feel trapped by the life and habits my previous self made and I want out. How do I change everything about my social life while I'm already changing everything about my self, all within the same time/money constraints I already have? Can I do that without hurting anyone? I don't think so, but I feel like continuing to do the same shit with them is ingenuine. Can I just be selfish with my time and attention like that? I want to isolate myself but I don't want to be alone. I'm already moving from this city in 8 months, I feel like I've got one foot out the door. But I refuse to live for the future like that. My present is NOW. My life is NOW. My desires are changing. How I want to spend my time is changing. I want to keep writing and I want to keep learning karate. I want friends who want to be creative with me and/or want to be active with me. I want to move at MY pace, and I want to figure out what my pace even is. I'm not okay with sloth. And how do I turn all this teenager-in-my-30s angst and theory into some goddamn ACTION? What does changing my life even look like on a day-to-day basis? I know I'm changing, and I know change takes time, but I need something more, or at least something else, and I need that to be okay. It's 1:20am now and I need to stop. I feel better I think. At least it's all out of my head. Thanks for reading this far. You're a gem. Goodnight.		eoz87b	trans	4	0.84	2020-01-15 07:32:13
Help Please.	Hello all. I‚Äôm not a member of this group but I hope my questions is okay. My now Brother-in-Law came out as Trans Masculine, Non Binary (he/they) about a weeks ago. Now I‚Äôm very new to all of this, but I‚Äôm trying to be supportive. I‚Äôve never known anyone who is trans so I wasn‚Äôt sure where to turn for answers. My wife however is struggling with the transition and is asking for patience with her sibling. This request was met with frustration and accusations, in addition to demanding that we announce this to our two year old son. My wife said that she was processing and would talk to him when she was ready, but that was also responded with anger and more demands. While obviously I‚Äôm going to support my wife, I‚Äôm really trying to understand the trans perspective. Is asking for processing time too much to ask for? My wife is trying to unlearn saying ‚Äúshe‚Äù and she has likened it to losing her sister. I know that the person is still there, but I‚Äôm truly worried that this will create significant friction in our families. If anyone has any suggestions or opinions, please let me know. Thank you.	"from a trans perspective, that hurts like hell to hear.
my mother told me she was ""mourning the loss of her daughter""

but.. i was right there.
i felt like she likened my coming out to me killing someone she loved. like by being myself i was ruining her life.

i understand processing time, but i also understand that her brother wants acceptance and not grieving.
he wants this to be celebratory. he's finally being who they want to be and have always been

and instead they are being met with grieving and mourning like their existence as a man doesn't matter compared to their existence as a woman. 

i also understand wanting to tell the kid. not as a ""this is your uncle ___. they are trans. trans means..."" and all that

but more as a reintroduction. before the kid gets it set in stone that they are an aunt, introduce them as an uncle. it goes over easier the younger they are. 

but yeah. i get where she's coming from i guess, but i also see how hurt her brother must be to hear that she ""lost her sister"" instead of ""accepts her brother"" type thing, you know?

thats all i've got
That‚Äôs very kind of you to reply. Thank you. That was very helpful. I‚Äôm also very sorry to hear about your pain. That Must‚Äôve been very hard. If it‚Äôs okay with you, I‚Äôd like to ask a follow up question. To be clear, my wife never told her sibling that she was mourning that loss, it was just to me. And I completely understand the child perspective. As in, ‚Äúthis is uncle so and so‚Äù. I guess my question would be, how do I respect this new life that my brother in law is beginning while also honouring my wife‚Äôs need for time?
just.. treat him how you would if he were born male. let her process in her own time, but while she does i would deal with it at whatever pace is comfortable for you.

i'm not in your marriage, so i don't know just too much about your dynamic, but i would let her go at her own pace while going at your own.


personally, i've never fully understood the need for time before accepting it. 
i get the need to get used to it, i do. to change pronouns and such. but in the end, all that's changing is some words.
she turns to he, sister to brother, etc.

and this is her brother's journey. not hers, you know? she can take all the time she needs, but he probably feels like his wants and needs are being pushed aside for her comfort. 
which can be really hard.

it's something to really sit down and discuss.

when i came out, after about a week, my parents and i made a deal. they would fully transition to he/him and matteo in one year. 
publicly and privately.

one full year to process and adapt and get used to it however they wanted. but they had to be making progress throughout, you know?
its different for every family.

my brother is just BARELY starting to use they/them when referring to me. he didn't use pronouns at all for a while.

it just depends on your needs ans relationships. but it's a long, serious conversation that needs to be had between you guys. 

hopefully this was helpful? i try haha
Yes! That‚Äôs very helpful thank you again! I appreciate your words. 

My fear is that her brother is honestly not a very empathic listener, which makes any sort of conversation, although well meaning, quite difficult. Almost like she‚Äôs not allowed to have processing time, she should just accept it. Does that make sense?"	n6qccx	trans	5	1.0	2021-05-07 04:32:22
Disagree and take issue with DSM5	"1st, I'm an old fart mtf trans person, married to my sweet wife for most of my adult life. Before beginning, I have mixed feelings and emotions about how best to help young people with Gender Dysphoria.

It states that the young person needs to exhibit "" characteristics"" at least 5 or 6  in order to be considered true trans.  

I take real big-time issue with that. What is a child to do when 1 parent dresses a boy as a girl and so that when dad gets home he beats the boy until a hospital visit is needed, repeatedly, and then move to a new town, and then move again. Is it enough if the child becomes so desperate that they learn at age 6 that eating rat poison will kill them and stop the pain? How do I know? That little boy/girl was me. I was poisoned under suspicious circumstances and almost died. But a short time later, it seems, I had learned how to end the pain, and ate rat poison a 2nd time. When my father died, I never cried. A 10 year child doesn't shed a single tear at the news, funeral or any point of its fathers death?  I barely shed a few tears as a grown adult for my mother.

""A child needs to exhibit a list of idiot signs and symptoms in order to be taken seriously"". I say Bullshit. And I might have added idiot

If I had dared show any more signs than I did , I wonder if I would have even survived. How bad?, my dad picked up a garden hoe, granted it wasnt trans related this time, just his usual anger with me, reared back like it was a baseball bat and hit me with it, if I remember correctly he hit me so hard he broke it on me, a 9 year old boy. Another trip to the ER, another move.

I don't have the answers for trans minors. I don't know What to say to them, so I generally don't reply to them, also not cool for adults to chat with minors, another issue another day.  If some kids were to show signs, it wouldn't be suicide you would worry so much about, but what might happen to them by relatives, neighbors etc...

Hang it there, you'll be 18 one day...its not much I know, but at least at 18, well you won't have to take it anymore.

The only other advice, talk to an official school counselor, or ask for a mental health referral, then in most places, what you say to them is protected, nobody at school, home etc needs to know what you are seeing them about. Things are getting better, medical community is learning, but I just needed to vent, its personal in this case."		m4lnmx	trans	6	1.0	2021-03-14 02:22:39
Howdy y‚Äôall‚Ä¶just seeking some reassurance/advice üòÖ	"Hi everyone, I‚Äôm currently in a sort of rough spot and don‚Äôt really have anyone to talk about it with‚Ä¶I was hoping some of y‚Äôall could be my outlet.

Long story short, I‚Äôm pretty sure transitioning is inevitable for me‚Ä¶and it‚Äôs kinda freaking me out.

I‚Äôm 30 years old, amab, 6ft 2, 275lbs‚Ä¶big beard, pretty muscular with a chubby dad bod layer on top. I have a lovely gf who I‚Äôve been with for 6+ years, a house, a dog, my own successful business‚Ä¶the whole 9 yards. 

I specifically remember wanting to dress like my mom at a very young age. She actually found me in the bathroom trying on her clothes when I was like 8‚Ä¶it‚Äôs a core memory for me. Through my younger years I had horrible anxiety that manifested itself as anger and extreme shyness. I was horribly insecure of myself and any time people would try to get close to me I‚Äôd freak out and say some assholish thing to get their attention off me. 

Once I finished highschool I had the opportunity to move away from my life and start a new one. I moved alone to the big city at 20 years old thinking it‚Äôd fix my anxiety since I could be anyone I wanted to be‚Ä¶that didn‚Äôt work. I didn‚Äôt leave my apartment for basically an entire year, I had no friends‚Ä¶no job‚Ä¶nothing. 

Eventually my money started drying up so I had to get a job. I did what I do best and got a job at a restaurant cooking wood fired pizzas (I‚Äôm god tier pizza maker to this day üòÇ) I met some great people, but I was still very shy and reserved. I had a couple friends, but I still wasn‚Äôt happy. I was binge eating, but still managed to lose a bunch of weight and get down to the lowest I‚Äôd been in a long time. (195 lbs). I did this because I had decided that I was going to attempt to get on HRT and try and make my body give off the impression that I wanted to people. I wasn‚Äôt this mean big burly guy, I was this anxious, shy person that lashed out because of his insecurity. 

I ordered estrogen and Spiro online from some shady website and began taking it daily. I was 23 I believe. 

I took it daily for about a week before my anxiety got the better of me. ‚ÄúWill I ever pass at 6ft 2?‚Äù ‚ÄúWhat will my parents think of me?‚Äù ‚ÄúMy grandma who raised me will be heartbroken.‚Äù ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt start hormones until 23, that‚Äôs way too late to pass‚Äù.

And that was that. 

I figured I‚Äôd try to live with my dysphoria. At least I could blend into a crowd as a man and nobody would notice me like they would if I was a 6ft 2 non passing trans person. 

Life went on, I moved back to my hometown‚Ä¶used my big city cooking experience to start a successful business, met a girl I thoroughly enjoy the company of and on paper my life looks like it‚Äôs going incredible. I just got back from a 2 week trip to Thailand ffs.

But instead of being happy allll about all that, I‚Äôm here on Reddit crying to you guys hoping that you can give me some sort of advice. 

I don‚Äôt think these feelings will ever go away. I‚Äôm super depressed about hot starting hrt when I was 23. My chances of ever passing now at 30 are even lower. I love my girlfriend but she is dating an assertive, confident man. She isn‚Äôt attracted to femininity. I don‚Äôt think I can ever tell her. The look on her face when her 6ft 2 bearded boyfriend tells her that he wants to go on hrt and become feminine would kill me.


I also don‚Äôt really know if I‚Äôm trans to begin with. Like, I don‚Äôt know if I ‚Äúfeel‚Äù like I‚Äôm trapped in the wrong body, or if I have the mind of a woman. I just know I‚Äôm not happy.

Ugh.  I know y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt therapists. Sorry for the life story."	"First of all, let me say that I very much hope I get to try your pizza one day. I work at a bar with an Italian restaurant and woodfired pizza with hot salami is to die for! 

Well my love, seems like you've got some hard decisions to make. You're not alone in this and a lot of trans people's experience is reflective of yours. 

So, a few things. Cis people don't tend to stress over gender, at least no where near as much as we do. If you've had these feelings your whole life and they're not going away, probably means there's something to it!

If you like, you could start simple to see how things feel. Try some minor social changes like choosing a new name and pronouns. Some minor physical changes like changing your hair, shaving, shaping your brows. If you try these things and it feels right, chances are you're on the right path!

When it comes to physique, you wouldn't be the first trans woman who started out very outwardly masculine hahaha! I didn't realise just how much of a barrier my beard was, both in the literal and metaphorical sense. As soon as I was done shaving though, I knew I'd done the right thing. Don't worry about height! I'm 6ft, I love being tall!! I fucking love wearing heels because they make me even taller! r/tallgirls is a trans friendly place of tall girl appreciation. For weight loss, I've found that intermittent fasting has been very effective for weight loss, especially around my middle. As for muscles, have you seen the freaking subs and bottoms in this subreddit? üòÇ You post a muscle selfie and all the comments will be ""Muscle Mommy!!! üòç"" ""Step on me Mommy üò´"". If it bothers you, work out legs not arms. I squat so much I have 0 fat on my thighs so all the thickness comes from muscle üòâ. 

It's never too late. There are trans people on this subreddit, including trans women, who transitioned MUCH later in life than you. 

As for family and gf... If you're family is ""disappointed"" that's a reflection on them, not you. You are part of a much larger family now ‚ù§Ô∏è  Regarding your girlfriend, I'm sorry, I don't have any advice on this front. If she's not bi, then it isn't going to work. What's most important in life is living honestly. Wearing a mask every day is murder. If this is how you feel, you'll never be happy living a lie. 

It might be worth speaking to a gender therapist to get your thoughts in order. 

Good luck lovely ‚ù§Ô∏è
I don't know what advice I could give but I can tell you the last 9 months of my life have been great. I live about 95% of my time is dressed. There has been times where I was anxious but I decided I have to do this. I live in a town of about 10000 people in Texas. I do stand out in a crowd. I'm 6'5"" without heels weighing around 250lb. I've got weird looks and one person laughed out loud. I've also found places that accept me for who I am and they get my business. For the most part people don't care. I found a LGBT community where you can find people like you can help.
Personally, I feel like the ""trapped in the wrong body"" narrative doesn't actually apply to many trans people directly. This is drawn from my own experience and anecdotal evidence from other trans people I know. It's more like you look at yourself, and you see pictures of yourself, and that is *your* body, but it's not what you expect. It's not what you *want* your body to look like, and you would be happier in a different one. What you are describing very much sounds like gender dysphoria to me, and I wish you the best of luck on your journey.
>I work at a bar with an Italian restaurant and woodfired pizza with hot salami is to die for!

So good ü•≤ We used to do pizza with Salami Calabrese (spicy salami), marinated onions, calabrian chili oil, with a spicy tomato sauce. 10/10.

I almost feel like the social changes are the biggest part of what is holding me back. I hate attention 99% of the time, if I did transition I‚Äôd almost want to remain in boy mode until it was weird, unless that‚Äôs a bad idea for some reason?

Thank you for the dieting advice. Luckily for me, the anxiety/dysphoria has a pretty solid effect on the appetite. I‚Äôm going through a pretty rough bout of it right now, which is what happened the last time I got down to what I now see is an ideal weight to start transition (200lbsish)


I actually went on BetterHelp and signed up to speak with a therapist regarding this right after I made this post.

Thank you for taking the time to write such a comprehensive comment <3
I LOVE CALABRESE!!!!!!! üòçü§§

Your timeline is entirely up to you. If you want to boymode until you feel ready to come out that's totally fine. Just know, that planning a check list of things to get done before coming out is one thing, sticking to it is another üòÇ Lord knows I didn't stick to mine back when I came out. Dysphoria said NUP and my timeline went out the window and I couldn't pretend to be someone I wasn't any longer, even though I'd planned to get a lot of things sorted first. 

Make sure you see a gender therapist, specifically. If they don't specialise in gender then it can lead to some unpleasant experiences."	10fq0hz	trans	6	0.87	2023-01-19 02:31:12
I am in a dark place this morning (TW assault and battery)	"Last year, I was tracked via my phone and physically assaulted by my partner.  
They grabbed me and hit me for talking with a friend instead of answering their calls.

Any suggestions on how to move on?  
I cannot waste any more energy on this.

Are you still in therapy? If not, I would encourage you to get back.
I‚Äôm happy you got out of that relationship ^~^ it took me so long to get out of my abusive relationship and sometimes I still wanna reach out to my ex so it‚Äôs really amazing that you got away from that

How Can I Help My Bestie with T Anger	Hey friends! My roommate may go on T at some point in the near future and told me that T often makes people get mad more easily; do any of y‚Äôall have any advice on how I can do my best to help with that, as far as how to react if/when it manifests? I mean I know everyone is unique and I‚Äôll still try to do conflict management how I always have, but if anyone has any particular experience with T and getting mad, is there anything specifically from those around you that made it worse/better? Thanks in advance!	"Don't make it a problem before it is one. It's nice to have the heads up that this is a possible side effect, as it will give you some context if it becomes an issue. But hrt can look really different depending on the individual, and he also has his own psychology over how he handles anger.

You can discuss conflict-resolution strategies, priorities and boundaries in a general way. Otherwise I'd say just don't sweat it.
I‚Äôve heard of it being a thing, but I don‚Äôt actually know anyone who‚Äôs had the issue. I‚Äôve found that if anything, T changes your emotional reactions, so things that used to make me sad and cry just irritate me now. I wouldn‚Äôt say it makes me a raging animal, far from it. The other thing is that it has a lot to do with how someone handles anger, like mmhmperhaps has said. My personal experience is that I had undiagnosed bipolar disorder, and going on T changed the symptoms I was experiencing. I had always had symptoms but they never became debilitating, so I just left it alone. Thankfully I was seeing a therapist at this point, who referred me to a psychologist in the same practice. Between her counseling to handle runaway emotions and the psychologist‚Äôs assistance in getting medicated, it turned out that my issues had more to do with worsening bipolar symptoms and not actually T itself. I‚Äôm pretty agreeable on T and don‚Äôt have any problems other than ones that that could be fixed. 
That said, mental health is a big part of going on hormones, because not only does it potentially change one‚Äôs reactions to things, but normally in puberty it takes a number of years for cis-males to experience all the changes. It‚Äôs somewhat accelerated for us trans folks. Just remember that the occasional irritability is not the same as the ‚Äúroid rage‚Äù that some guys get when taking high doses. If he takes T responsibly, he won‚Äôt be anywhere near those levels.

Thank you for looking out for your roommate! I‚Äôm glad you guys have a great relationship and that you‚Äôre there to support him!
Thanks to both of y‚Äôall! I do tend to think of the worst result possible and I‚Äôm just scared to make this experience worse in any way for someone I care about so much. I‚Äôm glad to know it‚Äôs not likely to be a roid rage situation and I‚Äôll just take things as they come   ^^_^"	ikz3o8	trans	6	0.88	2020-09-02 03:16:04
Terrified	"First off, I pay my respects to Brianna and her family. She should have lived a long heathy and happy life. She was 16.

She was found with stab wounds in a park in Cheshire, UK.

I‚Äôm terrified. From the UK and trans, and 15, I feel like she could have been me. Only a year older, killed by fuckers my age. I‚Äôm scared of people my age now and even being trans. I have never felt something like this before - anger and, for the first time, genuine fear and dread for me and the people around me. To be honest, at this point I just really need someone to be around who understands it all, the struggle and the fear.

But there‚Äôs no one."	"I wish I could be there for you, and while it is a legitimately scary situation, and I don't blame you the least bit, just know that there are good people out there.

I wrote about my experience with dysphoria for my English class. What do you think?	"Dysphoria

It‚Äôs been with me all of my life looming over me like a dark cloud that could drench me at any moment. The drops were small enough at first that I didn‚Äôt think about it much that is until I got older. It would slowly chip away at all that I thought I was or at least what everyone told me, what I was always meant to be. I would try and cover it up with dark eye shadow and shirts so tight it would make me feel the walls were closing in on me, no amount of exposure to the things I was meant to want, and never question why I should want them made the pressure dissipate. This eventually led to disasters beyond most people‚Äôs comprehension.

	I had been in my room looking into my dimly lit closet looking in at the cloth that made me feel some unexplained feeling something close to anger and being resentful. Just staring in made something in me snap, my vision had become blurry, and I started grabbing at clothes. Splotches of blue, red, and purple were all that was seen before they were thrown to the floor in a giant heap that only drew larger and with every passing moment guilt and reason started to sink in. 

	‚ÄúWhy am I so upset? It‚Äôs not like my clothes have done anything to me.‚Äù

	I look back at that memory and others like it and I wish I could pat that lonely boy on his back and tell him why. It was never his fault that his mind and body were never on the same page but instead in different dimensions that he was never meant to cross into. That the role was given to him at birth enforced by others and himself included was never his to play. And though it‚Äôs invisible to all, what he sees does exist and is reality for him."	"Reads well, you have some run on sentences. You use ""look"" twice in the first sentence of a paragraph. It makes it read a bit rough, so find another word and/or break it into two sentences. ""Disasters beyond most people's comprehension"" comes off a bit melodramatic.
Thank you for the review I'm pretty new to writing so I appreciate the comment. About the last part of your comment, I hadn't wanted to drive too deep into my experience since this is an English paper. But also, during this time in my life dysphoria had led to a lot of terrible things that people without dysphoria wouldn't get. If my closet incident was the worst of it, then I wouldn't have used those words. But I do see that from others' perspectives that aren't in my shoes would think that it is.
Fair, but there's a difference between ""couldn't understand"" and ""couldn't comprehend"", as the latter comes off as saying the suffering is to a level that no other type of suffering could reach. I'm only bringing it up as sometimes when you overshoot emotional impact it can have a reducing effect. But, you said you are new to writing, and creative writing is a place to play and explore. So what feels right, but be open to feedback from the teacher."	tq08ak	trans	6	1.0	2022-03-28 03:30:28
Serious: Asking for advice	"TLDR: I've been holding off on transitioning, because of my transphobic parents, but it's starting to take a massive toll on my social life.

Hi,,, don't know how to start this, so I'll just explain a little about myself.
I'm 19, want to transition to male, AFAB, European, live in a country that's not too educated about trans people, so it's extremely difficult to transition here or go on hrt, realized I'm trans at 13, have had a feeling of being different much sooner than that.

I have had a few conversations with my parents when I was 15 about changing my gender, but, of course, they've been extremely dismissive and when I pushed for it, it started arguments, leading me to not talking with my parents for months at a time, and completely ruining my relationship with my older brother.

That lead me to promising myself that I'll transition when I become an adult, but I never did it, because I still love my parents regardless of what beliefs they have and am so scared of them ex communicating with me. I already know for a fact, that if I ever transition, I'm completely cutting all ties with my mom, because she has previously already had a habit of getting bouts of anger and spamming my phone, every time I do something, that would ruin her image in front of our relatives. With my dad not so much, because, he's not exactly the talkative type, though I know, he would rather pick my mom's side, if she ever asked for it.

It's starting to become more of a problem, because of me getting into dating. I've been in 2 somewhat serious relationships when I was a teen. As serious as you can get when you're a teen, but both relationships I self sabotaged, because I got so much gender dysphoria, from not knowing if the person I dated loved me for being me or for the gender I'm presenting as. One ending directly, because of my gender dysphoria.

At this point, I don't know what to do, I hold my parents to high regard, but the issues with me not being able to allow myself to date and the few friends I've come out to asking me when I'll go on hormones, it's starting to stress me out. I already feel like a late bloomer when it comes to transitioning and the only way I cope with my dysphoria is by exercising and buying binders, calling them brass or tank tops, if I'm ever questioned on it."	I know it's hard but not transitioning will take a toll on you emotionally. Your mental and physical well being should come before what your parents want you to be, because you are your own person, not theirs and from my experience the need to transition, if you are already feeling it, will not get less over time. It's not healthy to deny yourself becoming who you are, if that makes sense.	wsno56	trans	5	1.0	2022-08-19 20:12:20

my mother has been my greatest enemy and my false champion	"tw: religious trauma, sewerslide 

ever since i was a little kid (born female) i have wanted to dress and appear masculine. my mother, in all of her parental wisdom, frequently slandered me and voiced her disapproval. ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not how girls should dress.‚Äù ‚Äúyou are not leaving this house before you put on makeup.‚Äù ‚Äúgo change your clothes, you look like a boy.‚Äù

i believe it is relevant to mention that i was raised LDS.

at the age of 16, i came out as a lesbian. my mother was supportive, but one of her first questions to me was, ‚Äúyou‚Äôre still gonna dress like a girly girl right?‚Äù eager to appease her because i felt i owed her something for her acceptance of me liking girls, i said yes. so, her forcing femininity on me continued. 

at this point, i was in a very dark time in my life. the teachings of the church condemned me, and not just for my liking of girls. it had been ingrained in my head that changing your god-given gender is a sin and that it was a horrible thing to even think about. i was lost in my feelings of not being quite right, not being quite good enough for love. all the while, i had my mothers voice in my head: ‚Äúyou are a girl. act like it.‚Äù

within the next few years, my family fell away from the church. i began to explore myself after graduating high school, trying to figure out who i was. some part of my brain hated who i was becoming, hated that i was choosing to become a man - in truth, i still struggle with this to this day.

as soon as i became comfortable enough in my own skin to announce that i was a man, and that my pronouns are he/him, my mother flocked to my side in unending support. she fought with other family members who mistreated me and even helped me in coming up with a name and find gender affirming care and doctors.

it is strange to have this woman - who was the reason i almost offed myself multiple times, the reason i still feel like i am wrong and unworthy - support me. she talks of how she‚Äôs always known, about how she has always supported me and loved me and she parades me around her social media as if i am some trophy she won. as if i am a plaque sitting atop her desk that reads ‚Äúworld greatest mother‚Äù. 

there‚Äôs this rage - this inhuman amount of anger - that makes me want to scream at her. i want to tell her that she did nothing to help me, that i am here DESPITE her greatest efforts and not BECAUSE of them. i want to pound her into the dirt with my words and take every ounce of false pride she‚Äôs gotten from my hard-won happiness because SHE IS THE REASON i have never been comfortable in my own skin. 

and yet i sit here, silent as she basks in her mirage of goodness and acceptance. i know she is lying. i know that she was my greatest obstacle when she should have been my greatest support. 

but i am tired of fighting."		sbvwz0	trans	4	0.75	2022-01-24 20:40:53
So I had a dream last night.	"And I decided to write a story about it. 
 
In the last few days I have been dealing a lot with the issue of impostor syndrome and the question ‚Äúam I trans enough?‚Äù Also because the signs that have been there from my childhood have been smalland hidden. 
 
My mind, decided to answer me with this dream. I hope you like it and not to bore you. For those who have these thoughts, I suggest you talk to that person inside you. Really talk I mean. She/He/they knows what the truth is. 
 




Somewhere

Somewhere there is a tower. 
Somewhere there is a gatekeeper. 
He has been guarding the entrance to the tower for longer than he can remember. Maybe he once knew what was hidden inside, but he has now forgotten. 
He only remembers his task. 
Few have tried to enter the tower over the centuries. No one has ever been able to get past the gatekeeper. 
Sometimes he can hear someone crying inside. But every time he tries to look inside, he only finds a room full of mirrors. 
 
Somewhere there is a tower. 
Somewhere there is a princess. 
She has been locked up in there for longer than she can remember, keeping her company are only a hundred reflections from a maze of distorted mirrors. 
Sometimes she has heard someone trying to get in, but no one ever succeeded. From time to time, at night, she cries. 
 
Every hundred years the guardian rests. He puts down his sword and lies down under a tree near the tower. 
No one has ever been lucky enough to try to enter in those brief moments. 
 
Until today. 
 
Somewhere there is a butterfly. The butterfly sees a tower, sees a peephole where she can slip in. 
She sees a maze of mirrors and hears someone crying. 
Delicate as only she knows how to be she rests on one of the mirrors. Her delicacy is violent enough to splinter it forever. 
The noise wakes the gatekeeper. 
He goes to check inside but the butterfly has already flown away. 
He only finds a scattered mirror and beyond that a pair of eyes, watching him. 
 
- I want to go out. 

Tells him a voice he seems to have known all his life. 
 
- You can't, it's dangerous outside. 
 
- I know, but I want to go out, I've been inside for too long. 
 
- I was given the job of guarding you. Nothing goes in and nothing comes out. 
 
The eyes beyond the mirror are filled with anger. 
 
- Do you hate me? 

Ask the gatekeeper, afraid.
 
- No, i don't. I know you were trying to do good. 
 
- I'm sorry for having kept you imprisoned. 
 
- Who do you think gave you the task? Me. I did, because I was afraid. But I'm not anymore, and now I don't need you. Tell me: aren't you tired of fighting? 
 
- Yes, I am very tired. 
 
- Then rest, you have done well. You can rest now. 
 
- But aren't you afraid? 
 
- I am terrified! But I want to be outside, I prefer to live afraid but free. Go my guardian, go. And thank you, I really loved you. 
 
- So did I. 
 
Somewhere there is a tower, inside it a labyrinth of mirrors and an empty armor. 
Somewhere else there is life."	"I really like this.

I feel like i‚Äôm letting my 7 year old self down by being trans (ftm)	hi my name is ren and im a 22yr old transmasc. im really knew with all of this but i need to vent so feel free to keep scrolling, i just need to talk. so i‚Äôve just recently realised that im trans or at least a form of it (idk im still confused). i still haven‚Äôt quite accepted this fact either, but i know it‚Äôs not going to go away. i always thought i was comfortable with being AFAB but that‚Äôs definitely not the case anymore. and i look at photos of my younger self and have such an admiration for that little girl and i feel so guilty and i have so much anger for myself now. in a way i feel like i‚Äôm betraying my younger self, or myself in general i guess. and i can‚Äôt even say how much i feel like i‚Äôve betrayed my family. but now that i know what i know, i can see the signs in my past. at least a few. and it breaks my heart. i never thought this was something i‚Äôd have to go through. i really hate this. i feel like the biggest fuck up and im not sure what to do. my birth-given gender has slowly become my very own personalised prison and my family members are the guards without them even knowing anything. i don‚Äôt know if i even have it in me to tell them either. i don‚Äôt want them to see me differently. im still me, i just done belong to this gender anymore. i don‚Äôt know, i just wish i could go back to being 7 and not knowing anything of the world. being human sucks. thanks for reading if you got this far. i hope your experiences are far better than mine <3	"I know 7 year old me would have been ecstatic if he knew I‚Äôd be pretty one day. Kids don‚Äôt really know that kind of thing too well (though for some they can to an extent). All little you wanted was to be happy and probably eat ice cream for every meal, and that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre gonna do
Honestly, what helped me with this was not trying to fit myself into the narrative of always having been a boy? I know that accurately describes some peoples‚Äô experiences, but personally I was a little girl who grew up to be a man. Being a girl was an important part of my life, but sometimes girls don‚Äôt grow up to be women and that‚Äôs okay. (And I also can‚Äôt wait to pass so I can casually drop ‚Äòwhen I was a little girl‚Äô into conversations to mess with people. It‚Äôs the little things.)
you are right about that. i probably shouldn‚Äôt dwell on it too much. and i happen to have some ice cream in the freezer :‚Äô) you can eat some with me if you‚Äôd like! and thank you. i appreciate your words <3

Scroll past, just venting about stuff. And if you stay, don't worry, it doesn't have any not family-friendly words.	"Man I'd love to have boobs right now, instead I'm stuck with a FLAT FRICKING CHEST that just doesn't look or feel good! And I'd also like to get my penis out of here or at least make it so that I can't see it! Oh and what it gets erect, THAT is where it crosses the line, it may be puberty but I get hard just by looking at a tree. A TREE FOR DUCK'S SAKE! And man, I would love to feel the effects of a menstrual cycle, even something to simulate it would make the cut! And don't get me started on hair! These fricking burnt spaghetti are so short it's almost embarrassing for others to even try and call me a girl! I would like to punch a wall right now out of sheer anger, but I won't, as it's a bad idea. At least I have my friend Martina to comfort me, as she's the only one I came out to that actually started treating me as a girl. Yeah Martina is a good person. But when people misgender me, it makes me so angry I'd sing! About my dead name (wich is Gabriele btw), I don't really get mad about it, as I don't have a new name yet. Really, all this stuff makes me wish I was at least the right age and had the money for the procedures and HRT pills! Man, if body swaps were possible, I'd find a trans dude pre-everything and swap with him, so we'd both be happy! Oh and of I even dare to try and go to clothes shops looking for (even ever so slightly) feminine stuff (because pretty colors) then my mother (who I'm forced to live with because I'm underage, and goes shopping with me because we don't have clothes shops near us) says: ""ThOse aRe fOR WeMeN"" WHAT THE EVER LIVING STINGRAY DO YOU THINK I AM? A CARDBOARD BOX?! So, this was my venting. You had no one telling you that you should read this all, but you did. Thanks, and may good things happen to you."	"I understand.  Thats why i went from she/her prounces to he/her because, Damn its annoying to be misgendered but i know what i am and i will stick by it, Work on it, etc etc.  If people are going to bitch about women clothing or women related things to you because you're ""different"" oh well get that shit and pay for it. Because they are only going to stop you from being what you want to be, The whole i want my dick gone and the other stuff relatable.
If it is any condolence - Gabriele is a woman‚Äòs name in Germany. The nick name for it is Gabi. Got me very confused there for a sec. xD  

First puberty is a mess for us. Hang in there lilttle sis. The time will come when you can go yeet that p.
Ok so I would like add this: and my voice, ooh that bishop! I sound like the Great Mighty Poo from Conker's bad fur day! I have to squeeze my throat to make it sound a little less masculine!
To put it in other words: I feel the sudden urge to take a hole puncher and some scissors to fix God's mistake and of someone says: ""Don't change! God made you this way!"", To that I say: (quoting a video-game non-cat) ""When a God plays dirty, it's up to a demon lord to correct him!""
To quote an old sage: ""Yeetus Peetus manly parts deletus""
I have now got a new name! I'm Iris, pronounced √åris.

that‚Äòs a pretty name. And a great flower, too. :)

Mom issues. Dead names and misgenders non stop.	"So I've been in transition for 2.5 years. My mom who is obviously having a hard time with it. As anyone would lately. Since covid started. I kinda? Quit presenting female. Which really sucks because I have a c cup. So I'm walking around as a guy with a c cup. Talk about uncomfortable as all get out. So this is lately but she has a heck of a Time calling me she or my chosen name. For two and a half years. 95% of the time she sees me, I am presenting as female. but she has seen me three times in the last 3 days because I am moving and she seems to be wanting to help. Non-stop dead name and  Non-Stop misgender. . My partner looked at her the other day with the evil eye from hell. Because she was just over and over butchering my name and my gender left and right.

 I understand that I'm wearing shorts that kind of don't really give me a feminine look and I'm wearing a regular t-shirt. I'm moving and I don't want to ruin my good clothes so I'm wearing old clothes. Does that make it right somehow? I realize that she gave birth to me and she's known me for 47 years,  43.5 of which i was her son. 

With her doing this to me for 3 days. I'm completely defeated. I'm losing myself. I've been crying all day. I'm stuck at her house for the night. And I don't know how to handle it. I just wanna run. If my car was empty of my belongings ide sleep in that. But I can't.  I'm on a tangent. Anyway. 

I've politely said. "" Mom.... Please call me blank . And please try.. just try to call me she as much as you can. 
And just start calling everyone they so you cover bases.

 It's hard. I mess up with my trans friend too. I never dead name her but occasionally I slip a he in there and I feel awful and apologize profusely.  I don't get any recognition of.  Oops I'm sorry. 

Typically it's not an issue for me to just shrug it off. But I'm already questioning everything and actually quit hormones for the last month. And to have her at me for 3 days. Omfg.

So I guess I'm out now, but it doesn't feel good	"TL;DR D&D players character is a ""trap"" and I came out to everyone in anger

I guess I've come out to several people last night in a fit of anger after a player in my d&d campaign revealed that his female character has been a ""trap"" all along. I've known this person since kindergarten, and it's not the first problematic thing they've done or said.

I didn't intend to come out last night. I had a private conversation with that player and my DM about what upset me and to try to come to a resolution. They offered to retcon that part of the character, it wasn't enough for me. Confused, I'm guessing, as to why I was so emotionally invested, the player just up and asked if I was trans... In front of my DM.

I was already on the verge of... Yelling? Crying? Some emotional breakdown... My DM put it together and tried to stop it: ""nobody needs to self-identify right now..."" He started, but I couldn't anymore. ""Yeah. Yeah, I'm trans. I'm fucking trans.""

I left the discord channel before the tears came, but I wasn't done yet. I popped into the other server where the other players happened to be chatting and I came out there, too. They heard me, on the verge of a breakdown, and asked if I was okay. I said no, and that I had to go, so I left.

I've gotten several concerned texts from everyone involved, but I don't know what to say. The dm and other players are all incredible people and I wanted it to be the happiest moment of my life when I finally came out to some of my best friends, but it feels ruined now and I'm left speechless. I don't know if I can forgive the other player yet. He seems to accept me, but - like I said - this isn't the first time he's done or said something awful.

Anyways, I'm sorry for the rant. I don't know what I wanted from this post other than to put my thoughts into words, but any perspective is welcome. Thanks for reading this emotional mess."	"Hey it's ok sweety. I know how hard it could be.

Believe me, i have told many people over time and it is always an emotional rollercoaster. Sometimes it's calm and sometimes it's not.

Good people can still be uneducated, and while it shouldn't be our job to teach, we get to help the good cis people understand better.
Thanks so much for your words. I think ultimately this can turn into a good thing. I had been meaning to come out to most of them very soon, so I think in a way ripping the band-aid off might have been good. I'll be okay. My friends have been so understanding that I might need some time before I can talk more. I really couldn't ask for a better group of people to call friends.

Feeling really stuck	"These past few weeks have been stressful for everyone in the US. Abortion rights are being overturned for AFAB people in many states. The murder of black people seems to be non-stop. SCOTUS will soon be revisiting Moore vs. Harper, which if passed will put the power of each state's government to decide what voting regulations are considered ""fair"" instead of the federal government. And, of course, the US government and our schools have been making so many anti-gay and anti-trans laws/rules, as they've always been trying to do. So of course I've been fighting. I've protested and fought back at every opportunity. But, as a white AFAB person myself, I feel like I've been carrying the ball on my own compared to other white AFAB women. I'm part of many pro-roe groups, but most white women on there seem solely focused on abortion rights in relation to current events. Meanwhile, I've been researching not only abortion news, but have still been trying to keep track of issues related to POC, queer folk, indigenous folk, and the murders still occurring at borders around the world. It hurts so bad. Old white rich male bigots are trying to take everything from us. I don't celebrate patriotic holidays in this country. I can't when I know we were built on genocide and slavery. We still run on discrimination to this day. Many women decided not to celebrate the 4th this year as well. Thing is, that is only because THEIR rights are being taken away. I think women and other AFAB people stand a chance at getting Roe back. It'll be hard, but there are so many of us that are willing to fight. If all left-wingers fight together, surely we would get somewhere. But many of these same women who are willing to fight for Roe would not stand up to fight during the 2020 BLM marches, nor will they stand up in the future. They ignore the fact that children are being torn away from their parents and stuffed in cages. And they've been ignoring the wave of hate we LGBTQ+ individuals have been experiencing. But those who aren't straight, white, cis, indigenous, or documented in this country? They've had no other choice but to watch. And I KNOW that if Roe was brought back right now, most cis white women would stop caring. They wouldn't try to protest. They would continue going to 4th of July celebrations and turn their American flags right side up. They'd change their profile pictures back to normal. They would live comfortably, ignoring all the suffering that no longer applies to them. My grandmom (who I've not come out to yet) said to me ""things will get better. They will bring Roe back."" But little does she know that my anger isn't JUST about Roe. It's about everything. When all of these ""ally's"" get comfortable, they will have no problem turning away. And when they turn away, people like you and I will have nobody to fight for us but ourselves and a few ACTUAL allies. I'm so scared, and I've been fighting at 100% for too long, and there isn't an end in sight. People hate us. It doesn't end. And I'm tired. I don't know what to do anymore. I'm so scared. 

FYI, I'm not here to debate. Please ignore if you are right-leaning."		vsj4h9	trans	4	0.84	2022-07-06 06:15:50
TW: Period Dysphoria	"triggers include: periods, self harm, suicide

I'm mtf and I get severe period dysphoria. i.e., the fact that I don't have one/the associated parts/not being able to have kids cus of my situation/ etc. etc. etc., just the whole deal. How the heck do you deal with it? Trans guys/afab NBs feel free to weigh in on how *you* handle it because I know it must be awful on your end.

Whenever the subject comes up (in any respect) I feel awful, I start getting suicidal ideations and the urge to self harm, and so on. As well as all the emotional stuff like anger, feeling sick, wanting to cry, and so on.

Part of the issue is that I want to be supportive of my partner when she gets her period but it takes me out. I would do anything to make her feel better except listen to her talk about it. I need to tell her that, but I feel guilty for even feeling this way at all, let alone telling her that I can't support her in some way. 

This causes me distress all the time, so I wanted to find out if other people feel the same way and how you deal with it if you do. I need to find some way to make this less of an issue for me because it's really taking me out."		y77uj8	trans	5	0.86	2022-10-18 13:59:41

_______________________________________________________

I have written this to share with you my thoughts and also to be transparent with the people I care about most. But more importantly I am opening myself up to you to heal and move forward with my life. I have always struggled with being able to speak my mind and my own personal truths. I chose to stay silent and do what I had to so that the people I care about would be content and I wouldn't cause any conflict. I have spent my life doing everything to please everyone around me. And while I have done selfish things I have never truly served myself. I found temporary comfort through that selfishness, but ultimately I let myself down and have never been content with how I live my life or my own identity. I didn't expect anyone to understand my personal turmoil because I kept this to myself so it probably seemed non-existant. 

I have kept things at a superficial level most of my life. From a young age I realized that self-exposure created vulnerability and that vulnerability allowed me to be true to myself. But it also opened me up to a lot of pain. Because people can choose to take advantage of your vulnerability and exploit it for no other reason than to degrade others for their own amusement. I learned that differences are indeed unique. But they also lead to persecution, humiliation and worst of all self-repression. Repressing yourself is truly the worst because your relationships all become surface bound and the bonds you create become sacred to you because while they aren't deep they become very meaningful. I have suffered from self-repression for as long as I can remember.


When you have repressed yourself you refuse to allow any hidden depths of who you are to be exposed. You are defensive and refuse to be vulnerable because of the overwhelming pain you experienced before. So you continue to be who you need to be to protect yourself and those who surround themselves near you. You do everything in your power to be the person you always have been for them because you don't want to lose the only people you care about that have been there for you. So you numb yourself to the idea of being who you are because you feel like you have to be someone else for everyone else. You supress these feelings however you have to with distractions, inhibitors, denial, religion and anything else you need to keep the truth in check. You become lost with no personal identity. 

So you continue to be lost until you realize that none of these things can keep you from what you know to be true. So you try to find ways to live around it, but it's still denial. Then after you can no longer deny what you know you become angry because you realize just how broken you are. But rather than stay broken I embraced my anger. I was furious because I realized that I had cheated myself from learning how to love myself. I have never loved myself for who I am. Who I have been isn't all a facade. But I haven't been able to be completely authentic or honest with myself. It has caused me so much grief, hurt, pain, suffering and it is unbearable to feel this way constantly. Many times I have held these feelings in because I don't want who I am to bring pain to those I care about. 

So I would internalize and remind myself that it is better for me to deal with these truths then have it all be brought down upon the people I love. I felt responsible for anything that could happen to everyone and I shouldered that burden because I saw no other way. But it has become more apparent to me now more than ever that I can be myself and that anything else that stems from that truth is not something that I am responsible for. Each person in my life is responsible for themselves. It is not my job to be accountable for the actions and reactions of other people. I owe it to myself to be more than content and more than satisfied. I deserve to live without having to remain fearful and burdened by the expectations of everyone else. I am not perfect, I never will be and I deserve to be loved for who I am. 

After much thought, self-awareness and therapy to ensure that these are indeed my true feelings I know now that you need to know me for who I really am and have always been to myself. But there are some things that you need to know before I explain any further. So please continue to listen and be patient as I share this with you. The first thing is this, I have asked myself many times why I am who I am. I no longer question who I am and my doubts about that are long gone. Everything that embodies me is built on truth and it's evident now more than ever that I cannot and will not change. I do not have any mental conditions and I am not on any drugs that would inhibit
my capacity for coherent thinking.


I continue to exercise my ability to have professional help to keep my life balanced so I can remain healthy. Secondly I am well aware of the potential and certain challenges I will be faced with 
by being more sincere, genuine and vulnerable. Some of them are intimidating still I know that it is better for me to face everything rather than run from it. I have spent too much time being reclusive and shying away from all of this. If anything time has shown me that no matter what I will have to face the world anyway. I've been hated, disrespected, mistreated, lied to, and the fact is no matter how I live people will continue to do what they are going to do anyway. But if I can be happy with myself I know I will be able to face this more positively because I can be myself. I have been my own worst enemy for a long time. And that has to change. 

Lastly I know this has to change. Because the reality is I would rather be dead than continue to walk this earth dead to myself and dead inside. And surely to you it may not be that serious. But I have lived this life with that pain and I have endured as much as I possibly can. I can't do it anymore or it will destroy me. This is not a game to me. This is not a ""Oh you'll get over it and be fine,"". This is my life and right now as you are reading this I hope you truly understand the severity of what you do next with what I am telling you. This is not a phase, it's not something I will grow out of or get through. The only thing I ask of you is to remember everytime someone said to you or you said to them that you would love them no matter what and imagine how much pain would be caused if that love only became words. 

I've wanted to tell you so many times before now and I don't know how else to say this. I wish I could tell you this with my own voice face to face, but it would just be me not being able to say the words without being too emotional. I am a female on the inside, my personal gender identity does not align with that of my anatomically assigned sex. I am transgender, a transgender female. I identify as a female. I imagine this won't make sense and you will be in disbelief. But more than anything else I need you to pause, take a breath and finish reading the rest of this. Before I continue let me just say that I love you immensely and my relationship with you means a great deal to me. Getting through life until now with all of this on my shoulders as well as everything else was possible because of you. I will always remember that. 

All I have ever wanted is to be considered favorably, be accepted and loved by you. Not for what I have done to meet your expectations, but unconditionally. I just hope that through this we can become closer as a family because being at odds with you would be painful. I want to be there for you like you have been there for me so many times. I hope you can understand and we can remain close. I know you will have questions and I want to explain everything so you can have peace of mind. When you have finished reading this I want to talk peaceably with you and provide any additional clarity necessary. I love you very much."	"That‚Äôs not a letter, that‚Äôs a novel! ü§™üòâ
I feel you here, sister. 

I‚Äôm also working on a letter to my parents - started writing mine about 3 weeks ago and planning to send it so that it will get to them in about 12 days as well. 

It‚Äôs really tough to critique or give advice on something like this - you know your ‚Äúaudience‚Äù here better than anyone, so I would say to use that and what you know about them and how they might read it. Aside from that, it‚Äôs your words and your truth. üíû

For me, I probably rewrote there start of my letter about 8 times before I realized ‚Äúmy mom is impatient. I need to get to the point quicker, and I can move the rest of the details and things I want to say *about* this further in.‚Äù But that‚Äôs me writing my letter for what I know about the people that are going to read it. 

I‚Äôve also had my wife look my letter over a couple of times already. There are close friends that I‚Äôm already out to, but she‚Äôs the one person in my corner that I know understands my mom‚Äôs particular brand of (should I say ‚Äòcrazy‚Äô?) ‚Ä¶let‚Äôs go with.. *uniqueness*

Otherwise, you‚Äôve got a friend in solidarity here in Canada! DM me if you want to chat or share stories - I know I‚Äôm already anxious as all heck and will be until I send this letter off; just counting the days until it‚Äôs out of my hands here.~
You're not wrong. üò¨
Thanks Willow you are totally right. I wasn't looking for critique as much as I was looking for affirmation. I've got until next friday and anxious is an understatement. I'm ready for this to be off my shoulders and good or bad we just have to do it. I'm sure we can bond over having *unique* mothers for sure. üòÇ"	nl68e3	trans	4	1.0	2021-05-26 02:28:18

I think I might be Trans female, So want some help and suggestions...	"So I recently realized I am Trans. I turned 18, just 7-8 days ago and ""have"" been a boy all my life. But, I have always wished I was a girl. I have been jealous of girls, all my life. Be it clothes, lifestyle, the way people treat them, they way they carry themselves, or anything. I have hated my private parts for my entire life. But Sometimes I think that maybe I am just jealous, maybe I'm just overthinking it, or maybe I'm just trying to make myself different to get attention. And, maybe it is true I'm not sure. That's why I came here asking for help. Plz talk to me... I would love to know other's experiences, so that I can understand myself and maybe make fwiends along the way(Yes 'w' was intentional in friends)... I have cross-dressed, around one or two dozen times and I love it. I hate my facial hairs and body hairs. So, I trim my face almost every 2-3 days(I get very hairy if I don't do it in a week), but not other body parts because I am ""afraid"", or maybe insecure, I don't know why TBH. I have trimmed my arms, twice tho. I would love some suggestions for future, too. I remember once asking my mom as a child of 4-5 years that ""why do girls pee from behind, and boys from front?"". This is a very strong memory. She told me ""it is just the way it is"". I still to this day remember the anger and jealousy I felt(I was 5, man).I think I should give a bit more context of where I live and my culture to explain my situation more, so here goes....I am from India, from a really good and relatively wealthy city called Karnal. Now in my culture, There is Trans phobia, but way less and different than western societies... In our culture, We don't actively teach children not to be gay, trans, or that it is a sin. We simply don't talk about it and then 60% times don't accept those who come out... 40% people accept the community, but of course that's not enough... The Trans phobia actually comes from not having enough knowledge and awareness... And needless to say, My parents are in that group... Now since they didn't teach me it is a bad thing/sin, I never really hated the idea of being trans and did everything hidden from them(My dad is narcissistic and abusive, so I hide a lot of things from my parents)... Our culture was very supportive of LGBT community, around 6-700 years ago, but then foreign invasion from Turkic then British rulers happened. India actually holds the oldest data, acceptance of the LGBTQ community... But, There is of course phobia now so needless to say I ain't coming out...  
And yea, I'm Bi too(I'm sure of it)

I would appreciate everyone's comments. Thanks."	"Hi! I'm from India too... A lot of what you're saying sounds like gender dysphoria and its like that you're trans, or at least not cis. We're all here for you! Feel free to dm me at any time üòäüòö
Happy belated birthday. Colonization has certainly harmed a lot of countries, especially when the invaders forced their negative views of trans and queer people as a whole onto their subjects.

So, if I understand correctly, you're questioning your gender identity? Ultimately only you know the answer to your own question. The best advice I can give is to connect with the trans community. Posting here is a great start. Do you also have any local resources you might be able to reach out to? Obviously your security is paramount, so don't put yourself in any danger, especially if you suspect your family wouldn't be supportive.
Thanx. Would love to talk.
Thanx for the advice and for the birthday wish..."	o7653m	trans	3	0.64	2021-06-24 17:51:26
HRT and changes in depression	"So for the most part I‚Äôve seen my depression and anxiety vanish since starting HRT.

I also do not get anger as much or as long as I used to. 

I‚Äôve just hit week 11 off weekly injections of EV and spiro twice daily.

Today was strange though. I felt the depression trying to set in. The dark thoughts were floating just out of reach. I knew they were there, I even started to emotionally beat myself up some. But it didn‚Äôt go as far as it normally did. Like the darkness and bad thoughts done ever overwhelm me. It‚Äôs a good thing of course, but I‚Äôve been so used to dealing with that suffocation type depression that I‚Äôm a bit freaked out by my new format that I‚Äôm experiencing. I should be happy but I‚Äôm just a bit freaked out.

I‚Äôm also feeling s a bit lonely right now. I‚Äôm with family but the lack of anyone really understanding me is hitting me hard. 

I‚Äôm in a better place since starting HRT, and this is far better than what it used to be, but it still sucks."		qji1x6	trans	3	0.81	2021-10-31 04:29:24
A coming out story	"It all started last Saturday, I was moving from my study apartment to my parents home and they were helping me with the move. We had a pretty bad time and we yelled at each other in less than 10 minutes (yeah pretty sad I know). Of course when we finished we had to have a discussion about what happened during the move, so we talked and yelled at each other again. Filled with anger I told them all I have to tell them, including my coming-out (for the record I've already out last year as a pansexual person and it went bad). 

In case you are wondering, yes it went wrong. They told that because I was with a girl and bisexual, I couldn't be FtM, that I was just looking for who I truly am (even if I know I'm trans since two years and I have out to my friends in January), and so on... 

When I left to go and cry in my bedroom, my mom went and tried to talk to me to understand why and how I went to this conclusion, she constantly ""corrected"" me in her way when I gender myself correctly. She tried to convince me that I was not and when I tell her that a doctor and a psychiatrist were agreeing with the fact that I was trans, she struggles a little bit. 

Yesterday evening, she came to my room for talking. She wanted both of us to go and see the same psychiatrist so I can have a chat with him and then, he can tell her if I was trans or not (yeah, kind of a lack of confidence in me). And when I told her that I doesn't want to go and see the same psy as her, she get upset cause ""[she] can't really know if I'm trans or not"". And when I told her all of the other things, she answered with : ""but you never played/liked girl stuff"". Which is wrong, since I'm an adolescent, I'm more and more interested in ""girl"" stuff. 

So yeah, pretty bad and I think it's going to be harder and harder during the holidays. Sorry for the long post, I hope you're all doing right."	"Sorry for your experience being bad. Have you tried perhaps printing some supportive info from sources she may not have a problem with? Might help break down some assumptions first, like

""You didnt do x so you are not trans""

""You are confused""

""You DID this so you cant be trans.""

All that is needed is you accepting that you are who you are. No doctor can tell your mom that part of the story. They can only provide facts."	hjfjqw	trans	4	1.0	2020-07-01 18:07:15
My super supportive friend (around 19-21f,afab) allows me (a 18-22 amab) to explore my other side, helped me shop, did my makeup, all so we could go to a PRIDE (festival) today!!!	"# LONG POST WARNING! 

**But... I also give you an insight into my mind + many smaller details and things I experienced going to and prepping for pride as a person who had never been out in public en femme, let alone one who's never worn or owned make-up, until now!** 

&#x200B;

Figured I should probably post this here since I'm always browsing this community and that the nonbinary and genderqueer spectrum can also fall under the trans spectrum (I think).  


***The prep:*** But today I went to pride! I have a very supportive friend (afab they/them) who agreed to come with me (amab, he/him pronouns just bc that's what I'm most comfortable with rn) so we had been planning it for 3 weeks. Over that time they'd take me to get makeup at a store in our local mall that has a corporate inclusivity policy, and so we got me the tone matched foundation, concealer, mascara, and 2 different lip glosses. 

On a different trip we went into one of the stores, tried on some clothes, and each got a very cute matching black dress + matching yellow crop top that paired excellently with it!! 

And a couple days ago she took me on a walmart run and she/they bought me a nice pack of makeup brushes! 

And yesterday I went to the mall in my usual masculine clothes, but this time I was tucked with a form-fitting pair of stomach high spandex underwear and a smaller waist-high pair of cotton underwear on top of the spandex underwear (both panties ofc).  I was also wearing a maxipad to try and help with the shape. I had been out of the house tucked before but usually only for getting pizza or fast food late-night, so this was my first time walking around and being physical while tucked. *very slightly nsfw:* >!I learned that my bits get really hot while moving around when I went to the bathroom and had to retuck. Thankfully, the maxipad saved my underwear from becoming too sweaty and allowed me to use it for today considering I wasnt out long. !<

***The day of! Prepping for pride! (and the emotional worry about passing):*** We were gonna practice my makeup the day before (also other days but those didnt work out) but we had to cancel. Then yesterday I went to bed extra early (attempted to fall asleep but took a while) and this morning I woke up at 7:30 to be ready for the day. I took an hour long shower and then tried to finally decide what I was gonna wear for the underwear situation. Could I find something to work to be untucked, could I find something that wouldn't show a bulge, would it hurt to sit bc of compression without tucking, or would I need to tuck? 

I had a lot of problems with this and the mentality and trying to figure it out and not be overwhelmed. On top of that I had been told that it was going to be very hot out. This made me worry bc that alone kills my plan considering I needed to wear my underarmor to act as leggings and hide my leghair. And then on top of that my voice is not fem-passing, and even trying my hardest to manipulate my larynx it's androgynes at best. I did sign up for voice therapy for free at my uni about a month ago, but it took a while for them to finally add me on, and so I havent had a real voice lesson yet. I also thought that voice training could have huge gains very quickly that would make someone pass (I've learned recently this isnt really true) so even through my best efforts of using youtube I was stressed about that. Bc no matter how good I pass, the voice could be a dead giveaway.   


At that point I had given up on passing en femme. But, I used my better judgement and gave myself the best chance of avoiding further disappointment if I changed my mind and brought my outfit, the underarmor pieces, my makeup, and anything else I'd need. 

  
During the drive there I still had given up hope but then I saw my friend doing her makeup and she was supportive and comforting still, and made me feel like ""Yeah I guess it is okay if I try it. She said she wont let me leave the car looking bad, and ofc the best place to not pass, or rather look androgenous/nb at best, even just barely, is at PRIDE festival. Yeah I guess I dont have much to lose, but I could gain a lot. I'll especially avoid the disappointment and maybe vast anger than if I dont try.""   


***I felt comfortable again to try it! Make-up time!*** So we got there and got parked. I decided I was gonna do this thing now. It being cold enough to wear the underarmor was a big deal to get me to this point. So she got out of the car, and I put up a little sun visor across the two front seats and changed in the back. I even had to change into the underwear I was gonna use to tuck AND tuck in the back, and that was different.   


Anyway, eventually I was dressed, and hand-sanitized, and so we started doing my makeup, Overall, changing took a while, and it also took a while to do my makeup, so we probably had everything done in 1hr 30 minutes or so. We had matching outfits, AND matching makeup. The only difference was that my earrings (clip ons that looked legit bc they were small hoops) were different than hers and that I had underarmor arm legging things to cover my arm hair. Bc Although I trimmed my arm hair, for whatever fucking reason it's still incredibly dark, just short. But her arm hair is now much longer in length, but the color is so fucking light. I thought by trimming mine it would remove the depth it had and make it lighter, which it did, but little did I realize just how light her arm hair was compared to mine. Maybe this is a afab thing? Maybe estrogen makes hair's color lighter?? I dont fucking know. But womens/afab's arm hair does seem to be a lighter color in my experience. Does anyone have any idea about whether afab arm hair is generally a lighter color???  


***We go to join the PRIDE festival!!! Beware!: Counter-protestor bastards, but loving moms save the day!*** Then we went to the park!!! At the front of the gate where the just starting trans pride parade was, there were some counter protesters. However, it didnt really bother me (maybe some small cognitive of still thinking of myself as male, since it's not that I get dysphoria from being male, it's that I want to add being female. In fact, that's why I needed all this underarmor, is because I WOULD get dysphoria from shaving my leg hair and arm hair off completely! To me, it just makes the most sense for me to keep it because I like it, dont mind it, and it just makes sense. Also, if I want to justify it, many cis-women have hairy legs! Some have hairy arms with dark hair too! So it's all gooddddd). But what was most amazing was that right besides these fuckers were the most loving moms and dads and counter protestors holding pride and supportive signs. One of those most amazing, loving moms even gave my friend a hug when she asked for one and let her know she liked what the mom was doing and was appreciated. These are truly the most amazing people! 

I hope to grow into being a loving, supportive person, who gives mom or dad or rather, nonbinary parent hugs and stands besides these fuckers just to diminish their power and make lgbtq+ people feel safe and loved!!!  


***Conclusion/what I saw/did at the PRIDE festival!!:*** We ended staying for about 4-5hours. In that time we looked at many booths and got a lot of free stickers and other cool free swag items. We also saw one of the concerts (it was really freakin loud), and swam through the sea of vast and amazingly true-to-themselves lgbtq+ people! There was truly every kind of person imaginable (although mostly the good kind üòä) like people in latex, really great looking ripped men in booty shorts strutting their stuff (go off king! I wish I looked that good!), women doing power moves of wearing JUST a skirt but with pasties (really cool to see! #FreeTheNipple!), the occasional furry, many madlads in full-latex outfits or wearing a different latex variation (I say madlad bc although it was a pretty cool temperature while not in the sun, latex is latex! And that shit is unimaginably hot!), and every other sort of person that falls into the lgbtq+ spectrum in many kinds of variations of outfits and clothing that is true to themselves! Of course, I'll still never know the true diversity, bc someones gender-identity or sexual orientation doesnt always show by what they wear, or their hair style, or external things like that. But wow, it was great to be in a sea of acceptance!   
I myself was hopefully somewhat fem-passing (that's just a thing for me, and me alone personally, like i.e. I dont project that view onto others though). Many, many people complimented us on our matching outfits. My friend would even say ""thanks! yeah, we even have matching makeup!"" And we would get further praise. Oh! I was wearing a pushup bra (not for the pushup, but rather the shape) and another bra on top of that, so I got to do the wear-the-backup-strap-between-your-boobies thing! So that was cool! 

  
***What I learned as a amab who's never gone fem in public before:*** Pockets! Fucking pockets!!!!! I never understand why people (usually women) would choose to hold a handpurse rather than just get one with straps! Now I see why. Many times when I wasnt holding my friends hand I would be standing and try to put my hands in my pockets like I do as a dude who's pants always have many many, MASSSSIVVEE pockets. However, every time I tried my hand found there was no pocket! AGH! At some point I just needed something to do with my hands. So I would hold my phone with both hands across my lap while standing, or even try to hold my shoulder-backpack strap.   
Oh! It was also the first time I had gone in the womens restroom (excluding the times when I was younger when I had gone into the womens restroom thinking it was the mens)! The bottoms of the floor stalls seemed pretty high. Also, they had these period product trash bin thingys built into the toilet paper dispenser! I had wondered where all those period products where suppose to go if they were not meant to be flushed down the toilet. It appears they go in there! 

&#x200B;

***My last words to you, the reader, and also praise for my super supportive friend even though she/they wont see this probably!:*** So anyways! That was my experience at my first ever PRIDE today! I originally didnt think about making a post, but then I thought ""there might be some people just like me who like to read cool stories like this."" I myself have browsed this sub and some others like it reading about people with supportive friends getting to do cool shit. And I'm not saying this will happen if you read this sub.... but then I reconnected with a supportive friend by chance (we happened to share a class at uni together) and it's been amazing! It's been almost 2 months since we reconnected, and I'm truly only exploring this much of this side of me because of her.   
I know she wont read this most likely, unless she happened to browse this sub and read this, but thank you so much bestie!! Ofc, I've let her know she's extremely appreciated in person as well. But still, the part I havent said to her is that without her this side of me, well, moreso the open exploration, would stop. Rather, it would continue, but it would mostly just go back to laying low because I wouldnt be comfortable enough to openly explore it. 

 I mean, I've learned soooo much about other things from her like what is possible with male and female friendships and how I could be friends with a girl and she could be interested in hanging out with me (a lot now!) even without her having feelings for me. Also, I've learned soo much and been sooo happy because she treats me like one of her girl friends! We're best bitches as we call it, and I love it! It's soooo helpful and amazing and yeah! Even though I identify as a guy, but am also genderqueer (still dont know exactly that there is a label for what I am, I just have an understand of it) and she gives me the experience I have always wanted: being seen as an equal among my female peers, and being treated as such. 

And the benefits of this friendship even impact my 19-20+ year mental framework from the amab Male perspective of how male and female interaction/friendships work. Before our reconnection, for my whole 19-20+ years of my life, I had not known this level of friendship was truly possible. I didnt even have a mental framework where a female could be interested in me, to hangout with me as much as we do, and her not even like me romantically. That's bc I never really had many friends that would hangout with me outside of school or school events and I just didnt think I could interest a female that way. On top of that, hanging out with her has taught me that I am mostly extroverted! I would love to hang out with friends 20-30hrs per week, even just to be in the same room to do homework, then to go make a meal. Before I had thought I was extroverted in some things (when I was comfortable like in school groups I liked), but introverted otherwise. Nope! I was likely always an extrovert, just one who didnt know how to be extroverted and act spontaneous (although I wouldve loved doing so and anytime I got to spontaneously hang out back then I loved it) and didnt have the social structure to support my extroverted side. So my sadness of ""having no friends"" for years (I had friends, just not many that would chose to actively find time to hang out with me outside of school much, but where otherwise great to me) was the pains of extroversion! Well, I suppose an introvert could want that too. But, I love hanging out all the time! 

&#x200B;

  
uhh...... okay sorry I uhh..... got carried away on a tangent trying to explain my entire mental framework and thought process to you, the 5 viewers who read this whole thing. Well anyways, every story/writing needs a stopping point so I'll stop here! I will respond to comments though, and may even post edit updates if enough people ask similar questions.

vent,,	"(afab) i‚Äôve been out as gender fluid for about a year and a half, i‚Äôve always wanted to look like a guy but i never really had the nerve to get gender affirming stuff (like a haircut, binder, ways i do my makeup, etc..)

a few days ago i finally got a binder and a masculine haircut and i‚Äôm so happy with it and the fact that i know how to dress masculine. though, that happiness went away quickly after my first time in public for a few hours.

every. man. i have seen, is taller than me. i‚Äôm 5‚Äô1 and i fucking hate it, i want to be tall, i want to look like a guy my age, not like a fucking 12 year old. and it pisses me off, and angers me, but also make me sad and feel desperate. i just fucking wish i was taller, even when i identified as female i hated my height, but i hate it even more now.

even if i ‚Äúpass‚Äù i‚Äôm still gonna look so much younger because of my height. or if i don‚Äôt look younger, i‚Äôll get made fun of for being a short man, which i will hate and i know i will because even being called out on my height when i identified as female upset me. 

i wish i could live like any cis guy, but i know i won‚Äôt ever be that way, not even testosterone will help me, nor top surgery or bottom surgery, i will always be this height, or 1 inch taller if i get lucky. yes there‚Äôs surgery to make you taller, but it‚Äôs so dangerous it‚Äôs just better to stay female.

i wish i could identify as a guy comfortably but i know i‚Äôll never be accepted as one in society. i wish i could transition but i think i‚Äôm just going to go back to being female presenting every day. it fucking sucks, i just want to be a guy. i fucking hate this."	"Does testosterone result in any growth? Conversely, I lost 2.5‚Äù off my height with mtf hrt.
I‚Äôm only 5‚Äô1. I went my whole childhood and adolescence thinking I‚Äôd eventually grow up and be tall. But 5‚Äô1 it is. It kinda sucks to have people assume I‚Äôm a 15yo boy- but it‚Äôs also kind of affirming that I‚Äôm doing this genderqueer thing right. More often than not people will simply feel embarrassed by their mistake and address you as an adult than patronize you. But I spent a lot of time struggling with the fact that there is simply no way for me to be taller, like how I always pictured in my head. (Though I do often choose to wear boots with thick soles for a little extra boost).

However, I know quite a few cis guys who are between 5 feet and 5‚Äô2‚Äù tall. My art teacher is the same height as me, but even though he has to use the stepladder to reach things off of a high shelf nobody views him as less of a man. In fact he has a great beard and moustache and has sort of a dapper lumberjack look going on. And many Asian and Polynesian men are somewhat short on average compared to white European height standards; even if you haven‚Äôt seen many short men around you, there are plenty out there. 

Being short can be inconvenient and cause others to view you differently from your own self image, but then again, what stranger can really know who anybody is from a glance? I‚Äôll probably always be a little upset that I couldn‚Äôt be tall and lanky like my little sister, and your frustration might not ever completely go away either. But you have plenty of other options to start feeling more comfortable in your body, so work to find joy in those changes and be kind to the building blocks you already have. Sorry for the whole book here, I hope my perspective could help you a little bit."	u0y0ws	trans	4	0.84	2022-04-11 03:09:24
A short personal essay written in response to recent events. I'm sorry I just felt the need to vent this out, and for how poorly this reads.	" 

Protect the children, they say. Trans and gay people are sexualising minors, they say. The LGBTQ community is brainwashing everyone, they say. It is an insane campaign of fear mongering and hatred all in the name of power, nothing more. They hate us, because we exist.

Every day now I dread looking online for fear that some new ordinance has been put in place somewhere, or that some new argument has been thrown together by them. As of right now I am writing this not in tears as I would like to be, but in a tangent of shock, rage and anger; the emotionally charged overture to Richard Wagner‚Äôs Tannh√§user blaring my eardrums as I try to stable myself. Today something inside me snapped after years of pressure. Years of hearing transphobic comments, nearly two decades of suffering under my own self-loathing dysphoria and my own isolation. And on top of this, the anvil on top of this flimsy structure is the society that wants to murder us, and by default me. In the United States, it seems like everywhere is full of politicians who want to arrest or kill us just for existing, just because we bother to think for a moment.

What really gets to me is the fact that these same people, these exact same people are the same trying to complain about their opponents trying to take away their rights to free speech and expression. The nerve! These people, I just want to strangle them, and by now I just might. I cannot express to you my anger with these people, I want to scream. I want to scream, and scream, yelling, crying. I want to express myself and I‚Äôm angry now that I can‚Äôt do it justice in writing. But these people, if one could call them that, only want power and wealth. They do not care who they step on to get it, in fact they seem to enjoy the suffering of those below them so long as their select view of what constitutes an American (or human but who am I kidding) remains unharmed. To all the politicians, you do not deserve your rights if your plan is to destroy those of others. 

The world is exploding because of us, embrace it. Scotland is on the verge of independence because the United Kingdom didn‚Äôt want us to exist. The United States is falling apart at the seams and human, not just trans, but the rights of all humans are being erased in every state whether you realise it or not. Don‚Äôt just sit and let it happen, that was my revelation; my epiphany was that nothing will get better if I just sit and wait for something to happen. I‚Äôm done waiting, I‚Äôm done with letting my world burn, and I‚Äôm starting here. Make yourself known, to everyone. Make yourself known that you won‚Äôt be killed quietly, we as people deserve the same rights as any other. I apologise for this ranting but I just need to let someone know, for whatever reason. 

They say that we‚Äôre the dangerous ones, while they‚Äôre here trying to silence, arrest and force us to comply with their cookie-cutter brainwashed conservative model. Again, I want to scream. I want to stand up on a soapbox and scream my heart out to the world, and yet a single voice is as good a silence in a world like this. I want people to hear me even though nobody will, because I feel for every single person affected by this, and I guess it‚Äôs instinct that I want to do something. I see suffering, I want to help, yet I can‚Äôt. But to them we‚Äôre dangerous, sex-crazed monsters that want to brainwash their innocent children. Us. The people who get beaten, abused and driven to suicide by them. Us, the people who are forced into conversion therapy and hiding because of them, the people who want to arrest and kill us. And we‚Äôre the dangerous ones. At times, I‚Äôve considered actually living up to their standard. At times, I want them to fear me like they fear death. At times, I want to become the crusader, the one standing up but I‚Äôm truly powerless. I am only trying to imagine a miracle, something that would make life better. 

Only because we do things differently, because we want to act on our desires rather than live in internal agony is it that anyone is hated. Only because we did something different. Only because we act differently to what idealist politicians want, we look different and we side against them. Because in the long run, that‚Äôs why they really hate us is because we side with their enemy. But it‚Äôs mainly because we‚Äôre something they‚Äôre unfamiliar with, and they believe that since we‚Äôre something other than what is ‚Äònatural‚Äô, we must be some tool of the antichrist, and must be hell-bent on destroying all that they know. They hold on to antiquated stereotypes because they can‚Äôt accept change, and they can‚Äôt accept that people are individuals with individual thought. Most of all, however, they see people like us as a threat, to their own stability. They‚Äôre afraid that they'll be forced to leave their comfort zone and enter into a wider world, and that we‚Äôll awaken something inside of them. So in a manner of speaking, the ‚Äòturning people gay‚Äô claim is somewhat true, but only really to the people who already had those feelings. And it‚Äôs the fact that they have to constantly spurt out nonsense about the movement that really exposes that they‚Äôre trying to hide something. Or at least that‚Äôs my take.

I‚Äôm sorry for this, I really am I just kind of needed a place to vent this all out, I guess. Mods if you take this down, just let me know, I understand if you don't want it sitting in the feed of the subreddit. Probably going to delete it myself anyway, though."	"I can relate to how you're feeling.
I'm from Iran and things haven't been nice here as well, and by that I mean everyone here.

I'm just wondering the actual heck is happening that the world is going insane during the past few months almost everywhere.

(And btw I don't think there's anything wrong with what you've posted tbh)
The most important thing you mentioned is not being silenced. Silence is how we become divided, helpless, abused, and murdered without repercussion. Silence is the bite that allows the venom of misinformation and misrepresentation to circulate. It's how people make us scapegoats for all their fears. The people that complain about ""too loud"" and ""whole personality"" and ""shoving down throats"" should try being silenced and alone for a few decades, then see what they think about advocacy. The people that whine about how their religious freedom is being attacked should try experiencing being outlawed for their whole lives. Just outlawed as a living being. Maybe they would learn what oppression actually feels like."	10fil3y	trans	3	0.72	2023-01-18 21:00:29
How can I express myself without possibly getting beat or disowned?	"English is not my native language.

So, hi, still don't have a name yet, I'm 17, a few months ago I tried telling my mom through text that I was Trans (mtf)  while I was in high school, I remember her replying ""there were never any signs"" and other stuff, I didn't tell her I was Trans straightforward but more like gave her hints, so she kept asking me if I was transgender.

Anyway, a few days later I (think) I did tell her I was Trans but it didn't go well.
This happened after I bought a maid dress on Amazon, when she forced my bedroom door open on me and caught me wearing it and told me to take it off because it made her sick.

Anyway, she came into my room and told me that I was confused, and that I have a penis and therefore I'm a ""man"", also she's Christian, well all my family is, My family is big and they all hate anything or anyone that is LGBT, especially my cousins, I recently blocked them on all my social medias because most of the stuff they would talk about would be about gay people.

My mom is abusive, she might beat me or yell at me, or threatened to beat me up like she did a few months ago like she always does if I try coming out to her again. My brother and his wife can also abusive to me mentally, My brother would hit me and scream at me, he also shattered my phone out of anger once, they can be like that, if they feel like it, and if they find out about me being Trans or if they find me wearing girly things I could be disowned, beat (obviously) or my mom could possibly send me back to our homecountry (Honduras) where literally anyone LGBT could be well, yeah, she threatened to do that.

I feel like I would be disowned anyway because of school, when my mom finds out that her 17 year old boy won't be graduating and will most likely be repeating 11th grade. I've given up on school, I used to get bullied for my skin color, I still get bullied now by a girl who takes my phone without permission and fucking hits me, also most kids there are just extremely pessimistic and I don't want to be around people like that, I just want to drop out of there when I turn 18.

Of course, I wouldn't have anywhere to go, so I was planning on just living in the streets until I could get a job or just dying in the streets of starvation.

I've been thinking of contacting my biological father who left me when I was younger to see if he would let me live with him, he lives in New York, but only my mom has his number, and if I do try contacting him, what if he doesn't want to see me anymore? What if he doesn't like Trans people?

Not even cps would do anything about my situation, it's been like 6 months since they visited me at school, a lady came to school and took me to the nurses office,  she asked me some questions, I couldn't even tell her anything tgat wasn't an answer to her questions, I was never able to tell her how my mom would throw me to the floor and kick me, slap me, yell at me, and other stuff like that, I guess they just don't care.

I told my school counselor about what I was going through a few months ago, and she would only send me to hospitals to go get ""evaluations"" to be accepted into a psych ward because I would always go to her office crying and telling her that I wanted to end my life, anyway, she was supportive, kind of, but when I told her I was Trans, she just, seemed to not care anymore.
I didn't get into the psych ward by lying my way out of it.

When a doctor was asking me why I was thinking of suicide, I told him that it was because of the abuse I was going through, I proceeded to explain to him how my mom would be abusive to me, he then said ""yeah that's normal, mom's do that"" and I fell silent, he then asked my mom if I was a threat to her, and he told her that she was a good mom.

That day at the hospital she also said to me that all men are unfaithful and that I will end up cheating on my girlfriend like my brother did with his.
I don't even have a girlfriend by the way.
My life was doomed since the beginning.

Anyway, I came to the conclusion
If I do get a job, I'll save up enough money to get estrogen and keep saving up to hopefully leave the US someday.

...I'm still too afraid to end my life, and I'm not sure about what I can do, I don't think I can do anything actually, because people online keep saying that no one will help me.

I was also planning on doing something kind of illegal to get money but I don't have the courage to do something like that. 

I was afraid of posting this to reddit because I'm scared that some transphobe will come on to this post and call me a tranny.  

If anyone comments it'll take a while for me to respond because I'm scared."	"Do not end your life! It sounds like you are going through a lot, and I am so sorry üò¢. Abusive families are NOT normal, and your mom and brother should not be doing that to you. The doctor you spoke to does not sound very good either. I am not an expert in this and there are definitely people who can give better advice than me. That being said, if you are in the US then I can think of a couple of options that you can look into. 

One option is to find a part-time job that you can do after school and/or on weekends as soon as possible, and start saving some money so you can move away from your family when you turn 18. If you do choose this option, then I also recommend finishing high school if you can. Talk to your teachers, they may be willing to work with you to help improve your grades (study sessions, tutoring, etc.). They want you to succeed! There are a lot of good-paying jobs out there that only require a high school degree, and having a good job with decent pay will make it much easier for you to afford an apartment and start hormone therapy.  If you want, you could also take classes at a community college and work towards getting a college degree. This way, you could be getting both experience through your job and another degree through your classes, which would open a lot of new job opportunities to you.

If you decide you just want to do college, then a second option would be to find a full-ride college scholarship. This way, you could get away from your family and continue your education on your own terms. There are plenty of new opportunities at college and a whole world of possibilities would open to you.

Also, the transgender communities on Reddit are full of good people. They helped me work through a lot of things when I first began questioning my gender, and I do recommend scrolling through and seeing what they have to say. It may take some reading, but there are many resources that you can look to for help. In addition to this community (r/trans), you can also reach out to r/asktransgender and r/MtF. There are probably a couple of other groups I forgot to mention üòÖ.

Stay strong! I have faith in you, and I believe you can get through this."	s6j4gy	trans	5	0.85	2022-01-18 00:06:25
A bit of poetry to calm me at work - Hopefully not triggering...	"So I‚Äôm at work, I just started a new job. Still not out, and taking lots of time for self care. However, I still find myself in a male dominated, unsafe environment and hope to move on to bigger and better things in the future. Anyways, dysphoria is kicking my ass right now and I just need to vent a little, as I don‚Äôt have my journal with me at work. Wrote a few short poems instead:

                        So much pain inside
                   Anger and hate around me
                             I sit and I cry

                               So empty I sit
                    The world blind to my secret
                             Everything is fine...

                           What is expected
                    A strong man for all to see
                          Softness inside me

                            She is who I am
                 Hate and anger when I‚Äôm her
                        I was assigned man

                       Be strong sweet lady
              Someday they‚Äôll see who you are
                        Acceptance is near

I can‚Äôt wait to get home tonight. Been a rough one for sure. You all make it easier though, thanks for being there."	"Sorry for the format. I‚Äôm on my phone...
Exactly what I need, thanks. I think r/transbooks would appreciate this poem too.
Thanks üòä I‚Äôve never checked that sub out before but will for sure and post it there too.

REPOST I don't know if I should drop my trans friends for being kind of transphobic	 Okay, so this story is kind of old and I did mention it in a comment giving someone else advice. But a couple years ago I came out as non binary, (a couple years later I came out as a guy), to one of my friends who was a trans guy. He then outed me to someone else and they had a discussion about how I couldn't be non binary because I was too feminine. This hurt like hell, and it still does years later. Neither of them told me but I did catch on after the person I hadn't come out to used they them pronouns for me and I made them explain the whole thing. I then spoke to the friend that outed me, and forgave him, but went back in the closet, setting my coming out years back and giving me a really bad identity crisis that was horrible to go through. This was years back, and he now knows the error of his ways and non binary people can be feminine instead of gender neutral, but I still think of it and it still causes me so much pain and anger and I've never really resolved it. I brought it up with him again but again forgave him. This was years ago but I don't know what to do. I'm not friends with the other friend anymore but I don't know what to do with the current one. Does anyone have any advice?	"Sounds like you can forgive, but you can't forget. Sometimes moving on from difficult situations takes a lot of time, but maybe this friendship can't be repaired. If you don't want to feel the pain they caused you, then don't associate with either of them. Giving yourself space from people that hurt you is a perfectly reasonable thing to do. 

You don't owe anyone your friendship.
Holding onto a grudge for that long is toxic. You keep coming back to it over and over and all it does is damage your self esteem and ego. It sounds like the issue is that you allow it to make you question yourself and how you feel about your own identity. People who are comfortable with who they are dont let the ignorant opinions of others from years ago effect them so personally.

Imo, i think youre still in an identity crisis and thats why forgiving your friend did not stop the pain of their betrayal of your trust nor the questioning of who you are. You dont get over this by ignoring the complicated thoughts and emotions surrounding it. And you dont get over it by forgiving the person who wronged you. You need to come to an understanding of why this triggers such a negative reaction when you are so far removed from that time and place. And no one here can give you that answer. It has to come from inside of you."	wz4l7d	trans	2	0.63	2022-08-27 14:44:12
I don't know. Just some thoughts. I need advice again.	"It's been about a month, so its time for me to rant about Gender Problems and my declining Mental State. I dont really have anyone to talk to irl so I kind of just  dump it here in Hope's something may knock my head straight so I can figure out how to fix my life.
I dont know. I post here often about my doubts and concerns and just stuff that bothers me, I know that's what alot of people here do and I don't really mean to spam, but it just helps.. Ya know?

Anyways, so recently I've just been trying to understand what it is I need to do. I honestly still am nowhere close to having a clue. I spend almost every moment I'm not stressed by things like work and family being stressed about Gender. Its had this death grip on my life since I could remember. There have been times where its loosened up a bit, but only for a bit. 

Truth be told, recently I've been getting worse, I've had some unhealthy thoughts recently that seem to only get more prevalent as time goes on. I try thinking and thinking to figure out what I should do, but I end up just getting frustrated and my brain short circuits. 
Heres my dilemma. I'm gonna be totally honest and not hold back on my feelings. Some of this may trigger some people so be warned. None of my hatred or anger for the most part is directed at anyone but myself. Here it goes.

I don't fucking know anymore. 5 years ago if you asked me what I need to do to improve my life, I would have told you ""I need to Transition, Change my name, tell everyone who I'm really am."" I thought that kinda confidently too. I wanted to get on Hormones the moment I moved out of my dads house and finally become the person I thought I was meant to be. Now, in the same during that time I had periods of time where I stopped presenting as Female because of Family issues and issues with myself. I didnt think I deserved to call myself a woman because of the way others had seen me, the way I looked, the way I sounded, the way I acted. These insecurities only got stronger as time moved on, but they weren't as frequent. Maybe it had something to do with the fact I was surrounded by people who supported me (my friends/girlfriend) but now I'm alone. I'm alone with my thoughts and this poison within me that I call Gender Dysphoria.
It's just the fucking worst. What the fuck am I? Who the fuck am I? Why the fuck am I? Why? 
So here is where I'm confused. Before I was confident that I was meant to be a Woman, the only thing that held me back from making changes before was that I was stuck in my dads house who was abusive, now I haven't taken any steps because I hardly think being Trans is a legit thing anymore. Truley. I cant tell what it is but holy shit, it seems like all anyone can ever do is just deny that we exist and sound really fucking smart doing it, like I have an obsession with logic and sense, but being Trans to me doesn't make any logical fucking sense. For some reason people like Matt Walsh, Jordan Peterson, literally anyone I view as more intelligent than myself has a negative and discouraging opinion of Trans people, for some reason I share the same opinion!!! Like I at least think I am suffering from Gender dysphoria, but theres this half of me that tries to constantly convince me I'm crazy and I'm just confused and don't understand what's really wrong with me. I see everyone who says anything negative about trans people as having a fair point, but anytime someone comes with logical support for Trans people my brain just instantly denies it and says they are lying. I can't believe I'm meant to be a woman but holy fucking shit I can't stop feeling like I should be. It's like every time I see any woman anywhere no matter what she looks like or sounds like or just literally any configuration ever, I have this internal magnetism, like it's so hard to describe. It's like every fiber of my being in that moment wants to be her. I dont have this same feeling towards men. I think women are literally the coolest and I just want nothing more sometimes than to just be, but then the thoughts crawl in
""Trans Women aren't real women.""
""Gender is based on Sex Characteristics.""
""This is a Fantasy, you're playing pretend.""
""This is illogical and stupid, you look like a fool.""
""You can't be a woman, you look and sound exactly like a stereotypical guy and you act like a guy.""
""Calling yourself a woman is disrespectful, you dont have to deal with nearly any of the shit women have to.""
Constantly some variation of these thoughts on repeat. All the time, they wont stop. I never get relief or solice. I dont even feel like my body is mine anymore, it's more like an apartment that I rent with 2 other people, but they have full control over everything in the house and I have none.
Like what do I do? I was seeing a therapist once a month for 30 minutes, whatever good that did. But now I'm considering not going. I'm worried I'm just going to get coaxed into being Trans for some reason like people talk about all the time. Like how can I tell who I am if people constantly inflict their self image on me through their own motives when speaking with me?
I'm just so gone. I know this was a jumbled mess but I'm losing grip. I don't know how much longer I can take this... I really dont."	"I know I will get random thoughts saying to myself that me being trans and wanting to change my name is silly and stupid. That‚Äôs our internalized transphobia talking. You are valid in your identity. I‚Äôd recommend to keep seeing your therapist and talk about this with them if you can. And if this one isn‚Äôt helping, maybe a different one will.
full disclosure, I've gone through some of your posts before. hi!


I'm starting to wonder.. do you think you might have OCD or some other kind of ruminating thoughts, centered around denial of transness or denial of womanhood? that ""it's impossible you could be trans"", ""it's not real"" etc etc


definitely keep seeing a therapist, and talk about that possibility if you want to.


because in your posts, I went through the arguments you called logical and thought ""damn, these aren't logical at all."" 


and, a cis person isn't gonna be convinced that they're trans. if you're not trans in SOME way, it just wouldn't connect. cis people don't feel magnetized like you described.


so no worries about being ""coaxed"" into being trans, there's also not a rush to transitioning (physically or socially) either, so it's truly up to you, no coaxing.


if you want, we can go through your arguments one by one, but that might make you ""short circuit"" and be more stressful than helpful.
Sorry it's taken me so long to get back, I'm bad at responding, but I think that would help alot. Would you want to go to Private Chat or just here?

I have toyed with the idea that I have OCD, but I was never sure if it was OCD or the Fysphoria that causes ne to obsess over it. As you can tell from my post history it's not like this issue is recent. It just.. Idk. I get better for a bit, then something knocks me down and all of my confidence and mental uplifting just goes down the drain and nothing makes sense anymore. My brain just defaults to what I think is Logical, which I can readily admit is probably flawed. Idk."	v91hgb	trans	4	0.74	2022-06-10 06:38:24
Came out to my parents last weekend. Felt immediate relief until my mom called me the following day‚Ä¶	"Apologies for writing a short novel‚Ä¶
TLDR: mom initially was very supportive, but called back the following day with anger and disbelief (which I helped her squash). How do I move forward?

I came out to my parents last weekend . They‚Äôre divorced but get along and are able to coexist around their children (sister and I). I told them separately and then we gathered as a family to discuss. The general reaction was surprise because they said I ‚Äúshowed no signs as a kid‚Äù and never would have expected this from me. In the end they were supportive and told me they loved me and would be there for me. 

However, the next day my mom called me and was telling me that she was fuming with anger, felt she had been lied to, was finding it hard to believe that I am trans, and that it‚Äôs unfair that she feels she ‚Äúhas no choice but to accept what I‚Äôm saying‚Äù.

I guess she talked to my dad one on one afterwards and was surprised with how Okay he was with everything (because he was rather strict with my sister growing up regarding makeup, piercings, etc). She asked how he was okay with all of this and he said to her ‚Äúwell what choice do we have?‚Äù 

I honestly don‚Äôt know how to feel about what he said but was not expecting my mother to be angry of all things. She also said that ‚Äúshe felt like she was experiencing the death of a family member‚Äù. 

How am I supposed to take that well? Sometimes I swear she has no clue how the things she says can affect people.

She said I‚Äôve always been a little impulsive and that when I set my mind on something I can‚Äôt think about anything else until I have it. She compared me wanting to transition to me buying a new car. While she‚Äôs right about how I am impulsive at times, My gender isn‚Äôt comparable to a new car. I haven‚Äôt been wishing for a new car since I was in middle school. Every birthday when I blow out the candles I didn‚Äôt wish for a car, I wished that I would magically turn into a woman. 

Her being angry and not believing me made it seem like I had to prove to her that these feelings are real to me. I opened up a little more and told her some personal stuff (like how i used to put balloons in my shirt at a young age to pretend I had breasts) to help her understand that this really has been going on for a long time. 

I guess I‚Äôm just having trouble dealing with the fact that she initially had a good reaction, and then made many of my fears come true with how she called me back. 

Any advice on how to move forward and handle a possibly disbelieving mother?"	The next day tantrum is totally a thing, not uncommon. She‚Äôs have the typical how can I make this all about me response. Give her time to sit with it. Just dismiss her negative comments like they‚Äôre coming from a toddler and you‚Äôll be fine.	tguxb2	trans	5	1.0	2022-03-18 06:23:41
HRT saved my life	"(TW for mentions of suicidal ideation)

Before I started HRT I was extremely depressed and suicidal. I had extreme body and gender dysphoria, I could barely take showers without wanting to just die Because I hated my body so much. I had genuinely almost killed myself because I couldn't stand being in my own body, I couldn't stand living everyday in a body that never felt like mine. 

Now I am 5ish months on Testosterone and I'm the least suicidal then I've ever been. I haven't been this happy with myself ever, I'm starting to love my body, my face, my voice, everything. Even the less appealing sides of being in T like how I am like 5x sweater then I used to be, I still love it. If I didn't get in Testosterone when I did I wouldn't be here. I am so lucky and greatful that my family has been so supportive of me and helped me pay for my HRT treatment, I know not everyone gets that privilege and I'll never take my privilege for granted. 

My body has reacted amazingly to being on testosterone.

At the beginning I had high estrogen, higher then alot of cis women's. I had 710 pg/ml of estrogen before I started and within 4 ish months it went down to 34 pg/ml. In 4 ish months.My testosterone levels started at 26 ng/dl and in 4 ish months I went up to 416 ng/dl. 

My voice has gotten significantly deeper like enough to where my mom always makes jokes that one of theses days I'll scare the shit outta her because my voice is changing so quickly. My mental health has overall improved I might be angrier but my overall depression and anxiety at least about my self image/self worth has changed drastically. I've even gotten a little hairier (my family has hard time growing facial hair as is). My period witch before gave me a lot of pain and dysfroia, is barley there and if it comes it's very little and doesn't last long. I'm gaining more muscle definition and my body is becoming more boxy.my jawline has gotten sharper. I'm alot sweatier and I run way hotter than I used to (I used to always be cold) like my dad. I've been getting gendered correctly more than ever. 
I was so scared that starting testosterone would worsen my Bi-polar symptoms but luckily they haven't too much. I'm a bit more angry and irritable but I've had pre-existing anger issues, and even then I'm more angry at dumb shit that I can logic my way to calming down, and I'm not nearly as angry at myself. 

TLDR: testosterone saved my life and it was the best decision I've ever made in my life"		10y2osh	trans	3	0.72	2023-02-09 18:51:14
I thought I would stop	Basically, I came out like 5 years ago. I changed my name multiple times between my coming out and now, because I basically hoard them (like pronouns and genders, just because I like it you know ?). But I'm aware that for names, its complicated for people to know how to refer to me, so i decided to change it legally and I genuinely thought it would stop me from changing it all the time because it would now be official, you know ? But I already feel like changing it and I feel so guilty for this. I didn't change it legally yet but I have all the testimonies from my friends and even my parents (who wont use my chosen name for some reason, and get mad a me when i change it but they still said they'll never use this name even thought its going to be my legal one), and told everyone it would be over, i feel really bad and I have two solutions I think : find a way to convince myself to just not think about names anymore, and just vibe with the ones i'll have because its just words, or allow myself to change it and face the anger of my parents and the guilt i'll feel when i'll tell my friends.		ulaz2t	trans	4	1.0	2022-05-08 20:55:12

anger and T	I've been on T for almost a year now!! Yay!! A lot of the ways I experience emotions is different now, which is not all bad or bothersome... Long before I took T I had bad anger problems, I've since learn to manage and control them and have just gotten less angry too. Now T has made my anger so different. It use to be very emotional, yelling, crying, saying not nice things, that kind of stuff and I'd hold grudges about it forever. Since being on T my anger doesn't come in the form of crying, I don't cry much anymore, nor do I yell, and I get over stuff quicker. But when I am angry it's much heavier, and it wants to be released physically. Which I think it's normal to feel anger directed at someone that you want to take out physical on them, but it is now how I feel everytime and it's more intense. Yet, I do feel like I have more control over it,  I don't believe I'm going to hurt anybody but to sit it with it is so uncomfortable and I have no idea how to handle it or release it. Crying is how I use to deal with it, but the tears don't come now.	"Transfem here. I went the opposite direction, had to deal with this exact kind of heavy, painful anger.


Physical activity or meditation can help a lot. If you are in the middle of work, excuse yourself for a bit. Five minutes to yourself can help a whole lot and if that doesnt happen a dozen times a day, people wont mind.
My post T anger ruined my relationship. 
I‚Äôd recommend finding a pro to talk to.  Try meditation, breath work, anger apps.  
There‚Äôs no upside to uncontrolled anger.
Beat a punching ball, take a good run, well do something physical to release the energy.
Can't do that when I'm like in the middle of work or even just out doing something üòÖ
Well, yes, carrying a punching ball around is not exactly practical lol. Breath control / relaxation / meditation type exercises can help too - needs a bit of practice but once you get it you can go into it quite quickly while still doing something else (as long as what you're doing doesn't impact your breath)."	ylnh8x	trans	2	0.67	2022-11-04 03:21:23
I'm incredibly angry.	"So a rant: This anti-trans bullcrap I hear on everything now is so angering. It makes me so upset because everyone is blaming the shooting on the simple fact, that the shooter was transgender. I hate that everyone is only focusing on THAT fact. Then there are people on comment sections saying stuff like: ""Average trans mindset."" Or ""We shouldn't be accepting their illness, we should lock them up."" And it's honestly made me emotional and extremely upset. My brother, who is a trans male and my best friend, could be in danger and I am a closeted trans, but I fear for his safety and I just wanna know why they keep doing this? Trans people are peaceful.."	"Your post has been filtered to our queue while we handle brigade issues.

Yep, remarkably peaceful. I don't think anything will come of it. The only people convinced of that kind of ridiculous bullcrap are people that already hate us, and they don't need a reason. They already thought we were all sexual predators based on 0 examples because it's just post hoc rationalization.

Every shooter has had at least one hand, so logically, hands must cause shooting sprees. If anyone makes being trans illegal because we're dangerous, I swear to make hands illegal too. I know manual apologists will try to stop it, but they cannot deny the validity of the facts. All they have to do is give up their sinful appendages, their digital lifestyle, and everyone will finally be safe. I hate that this is actually a more reasonable position than the ones getting passed as laws down in the US.

Oh! Oh! We could call it ""A Gripping Proposal""!
I agree. It's fucked up. But it's tormenting me emotionally.. I have plans to move to Greenland as I am learning Dutch and Greenlandic for the next decade or so, but the fact that these evil people are the same ones who advocate murdering innocent trans folk and calling it ""based"" is quite upsetting. I hate all of this. I need friends like me to discuss this stuff but I have none. So I subject myself to doom scrolling and seeing this country turn to dust.
Greenland? Cool! Watch out for volcanos; they're like rats over there. Well, if rats were huge and spewed fire, lightning, and molten stone. So not like rats at all.

One day, I hope all humanity holds in their hearts that to dehumanize others is to dehumanize ourselves. When the dignity of a human life, an identity, is reduced to nothing, it applies to us all. That's how we get feudalism, slavery, brutality, war, genocide. The value of any individual become solely based on how much they can destroy rather than create. Cities become ruins, and their bones picked apart. We're all a part of the same tribe, the same family. The only thing they're afraid of is their own demons.
Oh, that is Iceland haha. Greenland is the one with very beautiful houses and it's on a iceberg. Check it out, super cool! Also, yeah I don't like the hatred.. it's hella uncomfortable and unreasonable."	127f804	trans	5	0.77	2023-03-31 08:53:27
Don't know what I should do.	"34 cis male. Always felt like wanting to be opposite gender since puberty that I can remember. However due to my upbringing of real men don't cry and men are men, I've been wearing this mask all my life. The past decade has been especially rough lost my sister and both my parents now I'm going through a divorce with a child. 
I now have it in my head if I can lose 100lbs I can go try and get hormones everything will be better. It seems dumb, but that is what I've convinced myself to do. 
I feel like there's no way I'll ever pass so I'll just be on hormones for my own private benefit. I think it will be able to cool my anger down which I think is T and my inner frustration. I'd like to get bottom surgery down the road but I'm pay check to pay check in a deeply red state (Montana). 
Ultimately want to live masc but be fem in private, is that weird? Not sure if I have unrealistic impressions about how it goes, I've never reached out before and have only done research online."

Anyone feel strong flight or fight urges	"I'm trans MTF, have yet to start hrt. Anyone else feel constant high stress and anger towards the world before starting hrt.

It's been a slow realization that I'm trans and have had gender dysphoria my ENTIRE life. It's been so hard on me and this realization has been overwhelming yet comforting that I'm actually discovering who I am.

I've dealt with severe anxiety and frustration my entire life from masking my true self and it's caused a lot of mental anguish. I feel really quick to confront people and have aggressive urges which have gotten worse over the years.

My question basically is, is there a chance that hrt will not only help me feel more like a woman in the body I was meant to be in, but will it also help with my stress and constant aggressive urges (flight or fight response). Also, I never act out on these urges because I'm a good person who cares for others, it's just hard and scary to get these intrusive urges that really make all of this harder on me."	Mine helped balance my emotions and made them feel more authentic and appropriate (even if they're sometimes more intense). Stress and frustration were two big ones for me - before HRT someone being disappointed after talking with me could ruin my entire day - now it's much easier to deal with situations like that.	12er96p	trans	4	0.74	2023-04-07 16:42:15
AITA for no longer apologising when people misgender me?	" 

***Am I the asshole for no longer apologizing when people use the wrong pronouns for me? Furthermore, am I the asshole for getting sick, angry, and sad from people not getting/trying to get trans issues?***

I live in a fairly close-knit community where about 30+ people (M+F) regularly talk and interact (we're talking daily here). I am a trans (NB) person that uses he/him and/or they/them pronouns, and have been very forward about my identity since day one of moving in.

However, I've been here for almost half a year and I still am constantly referred to incorrectly. I've made it clear that if people are having a hard time with pronouns they can just my name. I've also said multiple times that they ask me any questions they have.

Bar one person, nobody has asked and it has been relayed to me that people don't feel comfortable asking me questions and that 'I need to make it clear that people can ask me anything because people are worried about upsetting you'. I've clarified every time that this is said that there's literally no question that could upset me, and I would kindly tell people if they asked something out of line.

However, despite what I keep saying, people are still concerned that any question they have will be met with anger. I think it's also important to note that it seems like nobody has even googled anything related to transgender issues. Not that I'm saying that they *should,* but like if you have a question regarding to that topic you don't feel like asking someone about, shouldn't you just google it and be on your way?

The whole point of the community that I live in is for people to connect, and learn to understand people from different backgrounds and sort out our damage. Yet, I feel like I can't fully connect with people because a lot of my said baggage is tied to gender and trauma related to it.

I have felt pretty gross about all of it for about a month now, and even snapped today and yelled at one of my neighbors here about it. They asked me who was doing this and making me feel this way, and I just bellowed ""LITERALLY ALL OF YOU"". Another time, I was denied access to a protest in relation to a law regarding trans rights, and it was compared to by many as 'not being able to see my friends'. Like, I literally have no way of putting what I feel about that into words. I've even printed out a webpage about what transgender means/is, and it has only been touched to make room for another notices on our building notice board. I am angry and exhausted by it.

At the same time, I can understand why this may be difficult for the people here. For a lot of people here I'm the first trans person that they have ever met, and aren't necessarily familiar with these kinds of things. I am also still waiting for HRT at this point, and do dress fluidly (I sometimes wear a skirt and sometimes use makeup). On top of that, they are also here to deal with their own stuff - why should they have to put up someone else's stuff? The people here do use my preferred name, and aren't calling me slurs or anything - but for some reason, the consistent misgendering is really getting to me.

I've been told that me no longer saying 'it's okay' when people are apologising for misgendering me is me taking out my frustration on the person and making them feel bad.

***Am I the asshole?***"	No, expecting you to be accepting of such things after that long is an asshole thing for them to do.	oyblva	trans	4	0.83	2021-08-05 06:15:50
Sad and angry every time I go online or even think about trans issues	"Recently I‚Äôve become more and more emotionally drained and just‚Ä¶tired. I‚Äôve been trying to avoid negativity, especially regarding trans issues, and I‚Äôve been trying to ensure I‚Äôm usually in safe spaces online that promote positivity toward trans people, but transphobia seems inescapable. I can‚Äôt even check the comments on a Minecraft build if it includes a trans flag or anything because it‚Äôll just make me depressed. I can‚Äôt see a trans positive tweet without countless people chiming in to say that we don‚Äôt deserve to exist. How do I overcome this? I already struggle with depression and this is making it exponentially worse. I want to be able to browse social media without seeing people shitting on me constantly, but that seems impossible right now. I can‚Äôt tell my family I‚Äôm trans because they won‚Äôt accept me. I can‚Äôt tell my partners family either. I have friends who are accepting, which helps greatly, but for some reason strangers on the internet hold more weight when they‚Äôre saying negative things constantly. I‚Äôve rarely been one to care what people think, but I can‚Äôt escape the excessive amount of people who hate me just for existing. This is sort of a vent post but also me asking for any tips on how to stop feeling hopeless. I‚Äôm hopeful that one day trans people will be accepted, but how long do I have to live in fear and despair before that day finally comes? I‚Äôve also just become angrier in general because of this. I used to be a strict pacifist, but a significant portion of my thoughts now involve all the ways I could hurt people who want to hurt me. I don‚Äôt want to think like this‚ÄîI don‚Äôt want to be a violent person. Anger seems like the only way I can avoid the sadness, but I know it is just as unhealthy. I just don‚Äôt know what to do.

This went on much longer than I intended. It‚Äôs just‚Ä¶overwhelming. I don‚Äôt know how to stop these feelings or if it‚Äôs even possible. I know plenty of others feel the same way, though many are able to overcome this for the most part, at least. If anyone has any tips or strategies to deal with this stuff I am desperate to hear them."	"Sorry if this posted like 10 times, I‚Äôm trying to delete the extras.

Guilt, fear and Dysphoria	"
Hello everyone I am an 18 year old Italian ftm and today i came here to express my doubts, fears and thoughts about my current condition as an ftm looking to transition.
But before we get to the contents of my conversation I would like to let you know that english is not my first language so grammatical and structural mistakes are to be expected!

I made this account a month ago just to remain anonymous to people that know me online.
Why? Because many know me as a biological male online as i have convinced them that I AM one, although as you can read that is not true.
I feel a great guilt by lying to the best friends i have ever had, I never told them to be an ftm and i convinced them that i am just a male with a horribly high pitched voice and feminine face.
I feel like I am taking advantage of their trust and if one day they will come to know what I really am I don't know what might happen and i am terribly scared.
I love them with all my heart, they were those that lifted me up in dark times, convinced me not to give up on life and gave me strength to move on, just the idea to lose them after this lie is revealed just terrifies me.

At the same time I felt like lying online about my biological gender would help me and it did.
I know it may sound bad, but the sad truth is the way people treat me when they think I can am a biological male and not an ftm is completely different.
This makes me sad, very sad.
And it has become like an addiction for me, being treated like a man online helps me cope with my dysphoria, triggered mostly by my self awareness and from people that treat me the way they do in real life.
In real life I am never treated like a male, i am never considered as a man, they always see me as a masculine woman and that angers me... i am not a woman, i am not a tomboy or a child i am A MAN!
I am a man... that is what i tell myself... but every time I look at my body when i shower I just look at myself and just think ""who is that in the mirror? It's not me, it is not"".
What am i at this point? Am i lying to myself too?

Dysphoria

That is what i try not to feel, sometimes i just go full weeks without showering just NOT to see my body, just NOT to remind myself that i am not what i think i am.
It's horrible and if you have dysphoria I'm sure you know what I'm talking about.

I am slowly approaching my parents to come out as ftm, to do the full transition finally. But I still feel like I will be lying to my friends if I do not tell them my real story and even if I will tell them when the transition is done they will somehow feel betrayed by all my lies.
Especially my best friend overseas.
One day I want to meet them in real life and this scares me.

This may be a rant from me and I won't continue because it will get too long, but it is something to start a discussion too, not only my situation but even on similar situations.
Have you ever been in a situation like mine right now? What did you do? What happened?"	"Non so bene come aiutarti, Antonio, ma se i tuoi amici sono veri amici dubito sar√† un problema cos√¨ grande. 

Per quanto riguarda le docce, ho sentito che alcuni le fanno al buio. Per alleviare la disforia alcune opzioni possibili potrebbero essere: lasciarti crescere i peli che di norma depili, comprarti un binder su Amazon (attento alle misure), farti tagliare i capelli (assicurati di farlo in un locale lgbtq friendly), voice training ecc.

How exactly can I help my dad understand that this is just who I am?	"So I'm struggling with my dad not being able to grasp the concept that this isn't some sort of game. He really thinks I'm joking or something. Like, no I'm not confused or joking why the hell would I joke about this.

This is bothering me alot and because of this, he's saying that Im changing in a bad way.

ü§® No?

He told me I need to quit the bullshit and stop, of course I'm not going to want to talk to him much.

Unrelated: He says wanting to paint your nails or having longer hair isnt necessarily a girly thing (which I agree with I was just raised to think the opposite) he loses his mind at the thought of me simply having a pink sweater.

I'm going to continue being me, in fact his anger gives me motivation because I know it will spite him and I think it's funny."	"unfortunately, the law of the land is you cant change minds that dont want to be changed. its insanely frustrating. i would advise not being spiteful solely for the fact that this could cause him to double down, which would hurt you in the long run. im sorry you have to deal with that :( but in the end at least you understand he is the   confused one
Ok I didn't think of that

I should really just talk to him, but it's hopeless.
He doesn't want to talk about anything regarding gender identity. But I know he's thinking about it because he randomly brings it up and makes me feel like sht about it. (Kinda like what this post is about)
its best to try and let it slide off of u whenever possible. its not fun, but necessary
Do you mean just force him to listen?

Yeah it'll probably suck but I can probably do it
i mean more along the lines of not taking his ignorant comments to heart. to play the devil's advocate, the might think if he forces you to listen to him, he can change YOUR mind, because he obviously doesnt understand that its not a choice. basically walk away when he starts shit. again, it sucks that you even have to do that
Okay I get what you're saying and I'm going to follow this advice and just see where it goes. Its going to suck but I definitely see what you mean by it probably being necessary

My wife and my deadname . Complicated.	"Repost from another page:

So anyone following me knows that I‚Äôve been on ‚Äúthe trip‚Äù with my wife since informing her I had to transition last March.

It has been up and down, and just a crazy ride with anger/tears.

That said, after visiting with her old school friend in Texas and learning that her friends daughter has now come out as NB, my wife finally settled herself with being ok with this. It took time but we are now here. 

I‚Äôm actually starting week 2 of HRT and she is actually excited for the changes to start happening.

One of the only places where we still have some issues is my name. My deadname is actually very easy to twist to a feminine one (Chris) and I honestly do like the female variation of that name. However my family already has someone of this name. And ironically her husband is also Kris‚Ä¶‚Ä¶

So as you may imagine I want to move away from that name, In addition to really wanting a fresh start for myself. 

I‚Äôve chosen Colette for my name to keep my initials the same, but my wife has reiterated that she will not be using any other name for me. She also says she won‚Äôt change pronouns or gender roles. 

Well I don‚Äôt intend to change my gender roll, my mother taught me everything I know so I‚Äôm comfortable in my current roll thank you. 

Pronouns I‚Äôm confident she will change when I start looking more feminine, I don‚Äôt think she realizes how different you can look later in transition, so I feel this will change naturally with time.

My name though, would it be unheard of if I just let her keep calling me Chris at home like a nickname? It would not bother me and I know many people with nicknames that make you scratch your head. 

In going to change my name at some point but if it helps her to cope I think I could let this one slip. But I really want that name change.

PS: we have also decided to combine and hyphenate our last names! We have Spanish last names so it isn‚Äôt too unusual. She never changed her last name to mine as she is an only child and didn‚Äôt want to lose her fathers name, but it makes some legal things difficult. So we are going to both change them together.üòâü•∞"	"How often does she actually use your name?  My wife and I use pet names normally, and to be honest.  I feel like the name thing would work the same as he/she.   And slowly change.
I have a female Aunty Chris! Her full name is Christine but as far as I know no one ever calls her that. So no, I don‚Äôt think it would be too odd
What about Chrissy?  Still related to Chris but more feminine.
Actually she use my name quite often, her pet name for me she rarely actually uses verbally or like uses it on her cell phone to identify my phone number. I‚Äôm sure it may change eventually, it‚Äôs just sometimes Gives me complex feelings and I guess I don‚Äôt know in a really weird way.
Yeah I like Chrissy and Christie. We will see what sticks lol
As you seem to have found a somewhat middle ground, maybe just let it work it‚Äôs way there naturally.   I‚Äôd imagine she will adopt the name when she becomes comfortable.   But keeping your old name may be a coping mechanism?"	p8r9if	trans	4	1.0	2021-08-21 13:15:33
I'm just so confused (a rant i guess)	Well i had accepted that i was a trans girl, but not being out to everyone means that i'm still in boymode most of the time. I've always struggled with just existing and i never really knew why, i was just really grumpy all the time and super quick to anger. I have always dressed like a girl and hated myself for it, but now that i've started to accept myself, when i dress as a girl and do my makeup i feel happy for like 10 mins, but then i feel it slip away into the familiar passive anger that has plagued me for my whole life and i don't know why, and i just feel gross so i take it all off and sit in my room lifeless again. All of this constant confusion has started to seriously negatively impact my life but i feel like no matter what i do, nothing ever changes. I just want to be happy, why is that so hard for me?	"I can sympathize heavily. When I was younger, living at home with family, limited in where I could go and how often I could do things I wanted, I was kind of perpetually in a shitty mood. Turned out I have a chemical form of bipolar II and I was frequently depressed, which manifests heavily as anger if your natural biology tends toward T rather than E. However, when I was able to move out and live away from my parents for the first time, I *immediately* felt less stressed and angry. Like, I mellowed out BIG TIME. And every time I‚Äôve been able to make changes that give me more freedom and the ability to invest into the things I want for myself, the less angry I was.

I‚Äôm sure part of it had to do with the combination of going through puberty with bipolar, some had to do with being near family who made me stressed, and some had to do with my lack of freedom and agency. However, most of those things are circumstantial, so when my circumstances changed, their effect on me ended.

I know how difficult it can be to feel so angry and confused all the time, and to feel like you‚Äôll never be happy. Regardless of how shitty things feel, I take comfort in knowing that nothing lasts forever. Good stuff, bad stuff, all eventually comes to an end.

It‚Äôs not your fault that you‚Äôre unhappy, and you aren‚Äôt broken or anything. Humans are complex, a lot of things affect how we feel about life and ourselves, inside and out. None of those things stay the same forever. Your situation, whatever it looks like on the day to day, *will* change, and the negative effect it‚Äôs having on you will go away, or at least change. Just try to take things one day at a time, focus on trying to make the most of the place you are now and really learn things about yourself. 

Anytime life feels like too much, drink a big glass of water, go put on music you never get tired of, and just sleep. Time keeps moving forward, regardless of how you feel, and you might feel better later in the day or the next morning. Think of it like a save point in a video game, you can always pick up right where you left off later on.

I really do believe things will get better for you, even if it doesn‚Äôt seem that way right now. I was diagnosed when I was 16 and I‚Äôm 28 now, and SO MUCH has changed in the last 12 years that it‚Äôs almost hard to believe. Just hang in there and give yourself the freedom to rest when life is too much.‚ù§Ô∏è
Thanks for this, I know that i'm moving in the right direction because my anger isn't anywhere near as intense as it used to be, but it still pops up too often for my liking, but this gives me hope that eventually i can get to a place where it no longer affects me
Just remember that the same way that bad times end, the good times will too. You might end up back in a place where you‚Äôre angry a lot again, and that‚Äôs okay.

Just learn as much as you can from your current situation as possible while you‚Äôre still there. Learn to pay attention to your emotions and what they‚Äôre telling you about your needs as a person. Recognize the signs that you‚Äôre in a bad mood or situation by the way you‚Äôre acting or reacting to things that happen. Figure out ways to help calm yourself down, or at least make it through.

That way, the next time things are rough for a while, you‚Äôve got lots of information and tools to help you, and the knowledged that you‚Äôve already made it through a rough spot before. It‚Äôll still be challenging, but you‚Äôll feel a little less unprepared or incapable of dealing with it when you‚Äôre at your best. And when you‚Äôre at your worst, just give yourself that same time to rest and pick life up again when you‚Äôre ready.

I hope things get better for you very soon."	n3y42u	trans	3	0.81	2021-05-03 14:54:35
In the spiritual realm, does gender exist?	"Why on Earth do we choose our sexes and why do some individuals decide that gender transition is part of our story? I have struggled for years with gender and here is the issue. As a child I always wanted to do the things girls did. Play with dolls, paint my nails, ECT. When I hit puberty I cross dressed in secret ( had a super religious family)   and I enjoyed it a lot but it was sort of like just a rush of feelings and sexual arousal. Fast forward at about 23 I started transition and I felt probably the happiest I have ever been, truly like lighter like a burden was lifted, when I was recognized and treated like a cis woman it honestly felt so nice. 

Problem is I have this endless feeling of guilt that says that I am lying to other people and that I can't ever be female.  Choice is the issue cause we can choose anything we want to become. Lately I choose more to act male, but I feel like my masculinity is tied to anger and hating who I am.

I feel extremely attracted to trans women as well as wanting to be trans."	"I don't know about the spiritual realm but I was raised hyper fundamentalist Christian and I've been undoing that damage to my psyche for 20 years.

Be you. Love who you love.

Assuming you are Christian, Jesus in Matthew 22:29-30 clearly says that people in heaven do not marry nor are given in marriage, rather that they will be ‚Äúlike the angels.‚Äù Now, this doesn‚Äôt mean that sex and gender don‚Äôt exist, but it‚Äôs a pretty clear indication that the conventions of this world do not hold authority. Additionally, there are a variety of intersex conditions: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intersex
If you believe we are created, then the existence of people with intersex conditions pretty thoroughly validated the separation of sex and gender - after all, to suggest otherwise would be to suggest that intersex people are made wrong.
Hey, I just wanted to let you to know, this is something I‚Äôm trying to figure out as well i  don‚Äôt have an answer for  you uyet. but I hope we can find it.
I don't know about you, but I sure as hell didn't ""choose"" to be trans. I just am.
I dont really understand the spiritual realm as anything other than metaphor so, if you want it to. Were you raised mormon?

**Intersex**

Intersex people are individuals born with any of several variations in sex characteristics including chromosomes, gonads, sex hormones, or genitals that, according to the UN Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights, ""do not fit the typical definitions for male or female bodies"". Such variations may involve genital ambiguity and combinations of chromosomal genotype and sexual phenotype other than XY-male and XX-female.Intersex people were previously referred to as hermaphrodites or ""congenital eunuchs"". In the 19th and 20th century, some members of the medical literary community devised new nomenclature to attempt to classify the characteristics that they had observed. It was the first attempt at creating a taxonomic classification system of intersex conditions.

Seventh Day Adventist
I'm not as familiar with the beliefs of seventh day Adventist, though I am familiar with how the church became popularized i think. I honestly dont believe in anything spiritual, I just dont really understand how I could believe it as is, but I cant imagine aworld that does have super natural elements and them not validating trans people. I think in that sort of environment it makes more sense to think that we souls that dont conform perfectly to the sexual nature of our bodies and thats okay, we can change them to be happier. 


I hope that doesnt come off as rude and might actuall help, I know what it's like to struggle with these ideas."	clfj15	trans	5	0.78	2019-08-03 06:12:57
how do you deal with anger towards society and cisgender people?	I discovered I was trans after a major mental breakdown for which I didn't exactly know the cause. I slowly discovered that it actually was gender dysphoria repressed for years because of years of bullying and abuse in my childhood and youth which made me move country for survival. I thought I was just gay. Now that I uncovered the truth, I am slowly coming out to close ones and work, first as non binary until I start HRT but I am so defensive and ready to attack at the first ignorant or transphobic word addressed to me. I have this anger I hold inside me that I often can't express directly when triggered that eventually turns into a panic attack. Has anyone dealt with this and how do you make things better? I really hope HRT is going to help me deal with my emotions the way I am meant to and that time will heal me but god this is uncomfortable.	"I totally understand the frustration, whenever I hear something transphobic I go to YouTube and search some trans youtubers react to dumb transphobic memes. I know it sounds like a bad advice and would trigger you even more but a lot of youtubers usually make jokes about it and/or educate the views. 

So that's what I do, I turn dumb transphobic sentences into a joke or try to educate someone. 

Also I too feel insane amount of anger and frustration because I'm trans or because of dysphoria. It's internalized transphobia and it sucks. Tell yourself that you're trans, and yeah it's hard to be trans but it is what it is and it always gets better!
Don't listen to the haters or fools. The brighter you shine, the darker the shadows. Fact of life. If you look at yourself in the mirror and are happy with the changes you see. That should be enough. Your own opinion is the only one that matters. Life is too precious to live for the opinions and judgements of others. If that really starts to affect your mental health and wellbeing, you can always reaching out to HR or the management. üíúü¶à"	11basbj	trans	4	0.7	2023-02-25 03:29:40
Trying to find words to explain to my little brother why I feel unsafe coming 'home' for Christmas	"Hi everyone!

**TW:** mentions of abuse (not in detail), misgendering, deadnaming, parental mental health, unhealthy family relationship.

**Background info:**

Me (26NB) Brother (16)

I grew up in a very neglectful, emotionally and mentally abusive home- (friends literally called me Cinderella cuz I was constantly screamed at and even verbally degraded in front of them) and was the main person in the house cooking, cleaning, changing nappies etc. from the age of around 12.

Brother is the ""golden"" child now but when he was born my mother had bad post natal depression and took a lot of rage out on me and barely even acknowledged him so I did a significant amount of raising him until he was  3 or 4 years old and she started behaving with intense jealously (I was the one there for all his firsts, he ran to me if hurt, I could understand him when he spoke...) and started to treat him the way she treated me. So I backed off from doing so much for him, she immediately stopped and luckily she did start to do more for him and started to treat him like he was near-perfect (hence golden child).

There's a lot more to it but in the end I had to run away in the middle of the night. Went fully no contact for about 8months and very slowly started to re-connect, shutting down communication with my mother anytime it became hostile/nasty  This deeply upset my brother. I've worked hard to mend the hurt it caused him and we now have a great relationship, he often comes to stay with me. I now live about 8hrs drive or an hour flight away. I talk with my parents occasionally (maybe once a month) and have visited them a handful of times over the past 6 years, mostly to see my brother and ensure he is safe but also to tentatively see if a healthy relationship with them is possible. This has gone somewhat well with my father but things with my mother are choppy. My mother wants me to ""stop dwelling on the past and forget about it.""

Since running away I've done a lot of therapy and working on my trauma, I do not feel safe around her, I never will. I have forgiven a lot and have compassion for her mental health but pretending like her past actions have caused no harm and that her behavior towards me now is respectful is just delusional.

I have come to realize a large part of what I took to be anxiety, has actually been gender dysphoria and I have been openly living with a new name and using they/them pronouns for nearly 5 years now. I told my parents of my new name 3 years ago and pronouns last year. They and my brother have never once used my pronouns. They used my name up until about a month ago when I messaged my mother telling her I forgave her for something and also brought up that I am trans and I use they/them pronouns. She blew up my phone calling me a liar and all sorts of things, since then my parents have started to only use my dead name for me.

On a happy note, I've built lots of friendships, am moving in with a close friend, I have hobbies, have a support network and I see my future in a more positive light.

**The dilemma I need advice for:**

All this year I have promised I will come to see my brother on his birthday which is this month but I have suddenly needed to move house, money & the timing is tight, I am moving 2 days before his birthday so I'm only flying in on the day of his birthday and then flying back home to my city the next day (I also have pets so I have to get back to move them to our new home & settle them in). Throughout the year and recently I have told him & my parents that I would not be coming 'home' for Christmas, as they have been asking every time we are in contact, I told them I have plans with friends. Last time I discussed xmas with my brother I explained to him the plans I have made and that I definitely will not be coming for Christmas.

Yesterday we were messaging and my brother said he couldn't figure out why I'm not staying longer for his birthday (bless, the innocence of not having lived the stress of moving home), I explained how tight everything was with the movers, unpacking and with my animals etc. he dropped the subject for a while but then said our mother suggested that if I'm not staying for a full week this visit, then I should come and stay for Christmas & New Years as a ""compromise"". To me this is not a compromise. When I asked if we could talk about it properly tomorrow he said we would have to wait until our mother got home. I feel pretty miffed that she has suggested that knowing I have already made plans as it's setting up hope for my brother only for him to be disappointed.

I do not want to spend my entire Christmas being misgendered, dead named and trapped in a place that I will not be able to leave easily. That's bare minimum, on top of that there's the current anger towards me (I know it's October but she holds a grudge).

What do I do?

I'm writing a message to my brother to explain that it really is just not possible for me to stay for Christmas, that I love and care about him but I'm not sure how much to include or what to say about things. I'm not going to share the abuse I've suffered in the past but I feel I would like to be honest and say the misgendering and dead naming from our parents makes me feel unsafe and honestly really sad.

Then there's my mother, I want to acknowledge that she's ignoring the fact I've said many times I will not be home for Christmas and that I have made plans, I don't want to make it rude and accuse her of using my brother to manipulate me to coming 'home' (that's just how I see it based off years of this type of behavior- if she can't make me do something she wants she gets my brother involved). I want to share how deadnaming and misgendering does not make me feel welcome or safe."	"Im really sorry that you had to go through that. I personally think that if you don‚Äôt want to go over for christmas then don‚Äôt. If you feel uncomfortable, unsafe or just don‚Äôt want to be treated badly listen to your feelings. I have some experience with an abusive home and most parents try to manipulate the child to come back home without considering their feelings. When it comes to your brother im sure that if you want to you can always make it up to him some other way/day and it doesn‚Äôt have to be on Christmas. If your ‚Äúmom‚Äù is pushing you etc just ignore her, do what makes you comfortable. I don‚Äôt know if anything i said will help you at all but i hope that everything goes well and good luckü´Ç
Thank you :)
I ended up messaging my brother and just saying there are lots of reasons why I can't come, that I will tell him when I can figure out how best to put it. I made sure I mentioned how much he meant to me and that it's not him and that I was excited to see him soon for his bday. And he was ok with that :)
I haven't and maybe just won't say anything to my mum, you have a point there about ignoring. I think I will go back to low-contact. Only getting in touch if something needs to be communicated and I'll go to my dad first. 
Thanks :)
Im glad everything went well‚ò∫Ô∏è
Kinda.... I am currently stranded at their house with covid so I'm not escaping after 3 days but staying at least 9 days woooo. (NOT)

Terrified	"First off, I pay my respects to Brianna and her family. She should have lived a long heathy and happy life. She was 16.

She was found with stab wounds in a park in Cheshire, UK.

I‚Äôm terrified. From the UK and trans, and 15, I feel like she could have been me. Only a year older, killed by fuckers my age. I‚Äôm scared of people my age now and even being trans. I have never felt something like this before - anger and, for the first time, genuine fear and dread for me and the people around me. To be honest, at this point I just really need someone to be around who understands it all, the struggle and the fear.

But there‚Äôs no one."	I understand, the attack happened really close to where I live. I used to love going out for night walks but now I'm just too scared..	112i1nu	trans	3	0.72	2023-02-14 22:27:18
Figuring Things Out	"I'm not in a healthy head space right now and I could really use some help making sense of some stuff. I'm kinda scared of what all of this may be pointing to, and I need an opinion that isn't mine, so I apologize for the length

I suppose that these thoughts have always (in one form or another) been in the back of my mind, but the time off during covid and some more recent realizations have given me way too much to think about.Growing up, I was kind of an angry kid. One of the things that would really set me off was when anyone one accused me of being/doing anything viewed as feminine. If I wanted to read a book or color inside with the girls in my class i was called gay. If I voted to do the egg hunt during field day instead of basketball I was deemed a sissy. It was similar at home, but nowhere to the same degree.

Somewhere between 5th and 7th grade (rough beginning of puberty) my anger turned into depression and I started feeling wrong in my body. When I talked to the school nurse about what I was going through, she said it was normal for kids my age to feel this way, that it was a normal part of puberty, and that I would grow out of it. This is also when the bullying started in earnest. One day after my gym class in 7th grade, I found myself staring at the naked abdomen and chest area of a fellow student in the locker room with what I could only describe as curious fascination. I was enthralled with what I saw, which was new for me as I hadn't really shown any overt attraction to any gender. Unfortunately I hadn't stopped by the time the kid had finished putting his shirt on. The next thing I know is the kid has me up against a locker and is saying, ""Locker rooms aren't a peep show. Eyes to yourself faggot."" Over the next few years I would find notes almost daily on/in my locker both in middle and high-school with varying forms of homophobic vitriol.

As time went on and I was exposed to more of the lgbtqia+ community, I began to be less upset when people called me homophobic slurs. It was still incredibly offensive, but I had learned that there was nothing wrong with being lgbtqia+. I came out as bisexual to my sisters(have since come out to whole family as pansexual) and was slowly starting to become more comfortable with who I was. It didn't last.I remember waking up one day, looking in the mirror, and not recognizing who I saw. Because it wasn't me, wasn't female. I didn't understand what I was feeling, and chose to attempt to bury those feelings, which didn't help. Over the next few years, I kept having more of those instances of unrecognition with an increased frequency to where I can hardly look in reflective surfaces anymore because the reflection I see looks wrong and feels wrong.More and more I find myself relating more with female characters in the shows I watch(eg: Adora and Catra in She-Ra and the Princess of Power, Korra and Asami in The Legend of Korra, etc). I find myself fantasizing about what my life would be like if my body was female instead of male. I've also started noticing that I feel uncomfortable whenever I'm referred to as male or as a son/brother. I hate this feeling of discomfort. I'm tired of avoiding myself and hating what I look like.

Is my gender identity female? Am I actually female and not male?"	"i think what you described is dysphoria, you obviously feel very uncomfortable in your on body and seeing yourself in the mirror. and you also hate being seen a guy too. i think part of the reason why you kinda dismissed it for a while was because you were told it was natural so you were just like ""oh, okay then, guess i'll grow out of it lol"" and never really gave it much thought for a while. i was sorta like that too? like, i had these thoughts of hating my name, hating how i was seen but i didn't really have a word for it so thought i was just being like weird about it or something so i just never really gave it much thought for a while. i now know that was dysphoria but i didn't know that then. you obviously get dysphoria and you'd much rather be seen as a girl. i think you are totally not cis at least. hope that helps?
Is it wrong that i'm having a hard time with this? Other people i know have come out as trans(one way or another) and they all seem to take it in stride. Part of me feels a sense of relief that im talking about this, but another part of me is scared
no, not at all. i think a lot of trans people take a while to figure it out if they've either been discouraged in childhood or just didn't know until later in life. it's not a very easy task accepting that everything you've known about yourself up until this point wasn't actually really you. for me, like once i fully figured it out and i fully accepted that i'm not cis, i felt a whole lot better about myself. like, it was almost shameful to me that i didn't fully feel comfortable just living as i was before, like it was wrong or something? but now, i feel like i'm finally living me for the first time in a sense. it's okay to be scared, there are a lot of unknowns in figuring out your gender identity. i'm glad you found relief in talking about this, i think it can be very stressful to think about this with little or no guidance. it was for me a little bit too. hope i helped you at all and good luck"	qddcda	trans	5	1.0	2021-10-22 09:40:36
I feel like I should give up.	"I think I'm trans, and I want to take HRT so I can live as who I think is me, and I reasonably can. I have enough freedom, privacy, and money to meet with the right professionals and get the things I need to start transitioning, but I'm scared of whether or not it'll be right for me, and if it is then what do I do?

I'm still stuck at home for another 4 years, at the least, while I finish college and find housing for myself, so do I just get my taste of freedom and put it completely on hold for the next 4 years of my life? And what comes after that? The U.S. doesn't feel safe for LGBTQ+ people so do I just flee the country, move to some other country or wherever? That means leaving behind the friends and family I do care about and starting my life from scratch. But if I stay in the country, I'll have to live the rest of my life in fear of ridicule, hate, and potential violence just to try and be who I think I am. And what if I find out that that's not who I am?

All the inner turmoil and deliberation with myself, all the internal struggles and self doubt, all the bridges I've burned, and all the pain will have been for nothing. What do I do then? Start from scratch and try to find a new identity for myself? Struggle to live with not knowing who I am? What am I meant to do in a situation where I can't trust myself to make decisions about and figure out what's best for my own well being?

The worst part is the isolation I'm already feeling. I should be able to talk to someone about this, or go somewhere to share it all, but I can't. It feels like my family would hate me for something I have no control over, online spaces that are supposed to feel safe feel like an echo chamber and that just makes me feel worse about any decision I make, because how can I prove it's one that I made myself, and I feel I have to stay silent around my friends, I've asked them if I could come to them about this, they have no problem with it, but I can't shake the feeling that I shouldn't ruin their day or waste their time with my problems. I don't feel like I have anyone I can trust that I can share these thoughts and feelings with, and the one or two people I do trust always feel to far away to hear me, or like I shouldn't even bother, what's the use in bringing them down with me?

Then there's my spirals. It feels like I always need a constant distraction, something to think about, something to do, just something or else I slip into a hole of self-doubt, self-hate, shame, anger, sadness, guilt, that feels like it debilitates me for the rest of the day until I go to bed and can suddenly start the next day going before I start to fall. It feels like my mind is out to get me most days, like it's trying to get me to keel over, like it wants me to say enough is enough, I keep trying to push through but each day feels like a different challenge that just gets harder and harder

I feel like I should just lie down, let whatever the world has for me take me, but what good will that be? If life after death is nothing then there's no use for death, if I somehow end up alive with a new life in a new body, who's to say it'll be one I want, maybe I'll end up a girl in my next life, but it could be just as likely that I end up a boy stuck in the same situation I'm in now, with just a few years of blissful ignorance of not knowing what I lost, who I lost, or what's wrong with me, and if it's all just one loop then it's just more of the same, more pain, more confusion, more doubt, more hate, and no knowledge of when it's going to happen, why, or how to stop it, nothing will be solved.

So here I am, stuck in a loop of doubt, of pain, and of confusion that it feels like I can never escape. I'll never look how I want, I'll never sound how I want, I'll never be seen how I want, I'll never BE what I want...

So why don't I just give up."	"Girl, stop overthinking. You are making many assumptions based on your emotions, it's all in your head. some may happen and others may not, but think about what would make you happy, don't be so negative, life is not like that.

Part of being trans is accepting ourselves, our bodies and letting go of all the internalized transphobia we have. It is not easy but you will see that every day it becomes easier.
How am I supposed to believe that things will get easier every day when everything feels like it's getting worse every day?

The assumptions I'm making aren't even farfetched my entire family have very negative stances on trans people, coming out would practically put a target on my back while I'm home. My spirals just keep getting worse and worse, it doesn't feel like I can share any of this with anyone I know which means stuff just adds up and compounds on itself which just makes stuff worse over time"	11b3qq4	trans	5	0.99	2023-02-24 22:14:16
So... What are all the hardcore religious people on?	"So, the point with this post is that most hardcore religious people say stuff like ""God made you exactly how you were supposed to be"" and I'm here like ""yes, you're exactly right, God made me trans and the devil is trying to stop his plans for me"" and they just start exploring in anger and it's funny af, but I'm starting to get worried, should I be worried?"	"Intellectually simplistic individuals react violently to the mere threat of cognitive dissonance. Any information or opinion that differs from theirs in any way has to be immediately and violently opposed.

You're not going to change these people's minds with this kind of rhetoric, no matter how pleasing. Your best bet is to just cut these people out of your life.

Figured you all would get a ‚Äúkick‚Äù out of this story‚Ä¶	"Growing up with ADHD means you‚Äôre probably gonna have to deal with some anger issues. 

Well, I definitely did. Specifically when it came to my name. 

I‚Äôve always hated my birth name, and at some point in preschool I just decided one day that I was going to change it to a version that sounds more feminine. ( like ‚ÄúRobert‚Äù to ‚ÄúRobbie‚Äù, not like ‚ÄúJohn‚Äù to ‚ÄúJane‚Äù )

Anyway, whenever someone would call me my birth name, I‚Äôd be pissed. I‚Äôd say ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs NOT my name‚Äù and correct them. Usually, they‚Äôd go along with it. But some people thought it was funny to keep calling me my birth name over and over again, specifically because I got so mad about it. 

There were many incidents from preschool through elementary where I‚Äôd tell someone ‚Äúif you call me that name again, I‚Äôm going to kick you in the shin‚Äù. And followed through with that threat. 

One of those incidents was me actually kicking a teacher. (I didn‚Äôt get in trouble because he admitted he was being a dick)

Now, years and years later I‚Äôm realizing that I was having a reasonable reaction to being deadnamed, and not just being weird about a nickname."		tbjqo8	trans	3	1.0	2022-03-11 06:25:18
Need some help	Hi.. I've recently realized that when I am called by my current name (it is very feminine, I'm AFAB) it gives me a little anger, and I also feel angry towards my feminine body parts as if they are an enemy of some sort. I've never heard this as being dysphoria, but is it a common experience at all?	"From some of the people I know (I myself haven‚Äôt felt gender dysphoria before), yes, that can be a sign of gender dysphoria. The anger you feel is your minds reaction to that gender dysphoria
It is very possible but also maybe dont rule out body dysphoria as well. It may be worth spending some time doing some deep soul searching and figuring out which it is. Im not saying you are or arent trans but there are certain hypotheticals that may help if you are interested. Sorry I just don‚Äôt know where you are at with things so im just trying to be considerate.
Do you know how I could start attempting to soul search? Just thinking on it a lot?
Ok try perception. Imagine yourself as a guy doing guy things or just doing something not gender specific say getting something from the local supermarket I suppose maybe for you thatd be aldi or lidl. But look at the comparison of you doing a mundane task like that as a guy. How does that make you feel? Do you get a feeling like oh thats it or that might be it or that could be but there may be more. Just think like if you could press a button right now and be a guy would you? Could you see yourself as a masculine woman? Things like that. I can probably come up with tons of theoretical situations."	n7ecxv	trans	3	1.0	2021-05-08 01:37:30
How do I correct mom & grandma deadnaming my son without being condescending?	"My son graduates high school in a couple of months, and he's 18 now. He's been out for about a year and a half to my wife and I, as well as our family. It's been great for his overall health - therapy visits are few and far between, he's happy and it makes me so happy.

When my wife (his mom) makes a misstep, it's typically, but not always, pronouns. My correction is usually just a one word, ""him"" or ""his"" comment. She hates this, and says that I'm being condescending. If I defend myself, annoyed anger can quickly become nuclear anger if I don't backslide very humbly and apologize my ass off.

When my MIL (his grandmother) makes a misstep, it's both pronouns and his deadname and it's frequent. I do the same correcting, either ""him/he/his"" or ""chosen-name"". She seems receptive, but it *always* turns into a big deal because it pisses my wife off even more when I correct her mother than when I correct her. Nuclear anger comes quickly in this case, so now I never correct her to keep the peace.

I have a neutral tone, and have tried to cheer it up a little, make it softer, so that I don't sound unintentionally harsh or anything. But at this point... I'm getting so tired of having to feel like I'm the bad guy for correcting my son's mother and grandmother. The excuse is always, ""well we're trying, he was *deadname* for 17 years.""

How do I fix this? I get so angry when they continue to do it occasionally, but it's over and over and over with the occasional mistakes. I haven't accidentally slipped in a pronoun or name mistake in about 9 months - am I just being an idiot and not seeing how difficult it is for a mother and grandmother?"	"Im sorry Im not in the mood to give full proper advice. Ill just write my experience below. I dont think calling you condescending for quickly correcting them sounds very accepting, if they actually care they should accept corrections happily.

But if they are upset being corrected, clearly they arent trying. If they were they would at least accept the correction and maybe even apologise. Like when someone introduces themself with a name and you >!(generic you)!< just say a random name and they say its not their name, acting like you are hurt now is probably unanimously absolutely inappropriate.

Ive come out to so many people who are young, old, close relatives, family friends or strangers. And usually people manage to get it roughly correct, especially after being corrected once or noticing themselves (like when meeting after a while and they forget, then they usually apologise as well). Ive never experienced a supportive person get it wrong after being corrected multiple times in quick succession. And everyone who just keeps going has been from slightly ignorant (and maybe disrespectful) to outright hateful. 

My dad struggled for a few months and Im not sure if it could happen again, but hes really concerned about me. Sometimes I felt like he didnt understand how much it hurt me, how I avoided him sometimes even though it saddened me, because I didnt wanna get into this kind of situation. But it was usually after a stressful day and I dont live with them and since I avoided him it was probably harder; overall it was only a few times, not constantly, and has stopped now, hopefully. Maybe making this importance clear could help.

So if they actually care about us, they seem not to understand, it seems like to them its like a funky nickname, we could change randomly again and which our friends casually call us, so its not worth the effort. Or they do it intentionally to force some kind of view into us, rejecting our gender identity by reminding us of what they think we ought to be, selfishly ignorant to our feelings.
Explain to them that if they refuse to properly refer to your kid, they won't have an opportunity to do so since they will be cut out of the kids life.
As difficult as it is, I think you are going to have to face the nuclear war face on because your wife is showing a lack of respect for your son, and a distinct lack of respect for you. If she keeps getting angry at you for making minor corrections, and especially about corrections to her mother. This is an issue that needs addressing, and it needs addressing soon.

As far as the ‚Äòtheir name has been xxxx for so many years‚Äô speech, that‚Äôs just laziness and ignorance, with a dash of disrespect.

I‚Äôm sorry that you are in this situation, but you are a great parent for your child!
My wife corrects people by reminding them by taking their statement and repeating it with the correct pronouns/name. 

‚ÄúShe did xyz.‚Äù

‚ÄúYes /he/ did.‚Äù

Maybe it will be a little less jarring. But seriously‚Ä¶it‚Äôs not condescending to correct someone. Because the correction isn‚Äôt about /you/ feeling better, it‚Äôs about making your son safe in the home. 

Taking some time to adjust makes sense. But my grandma has known I‚Äôm nonbinary for a year and she always gets my name and pronouns right, unless she‚Äôs talking about something in the past, usually when I was very young. And even I don‚Äôt know quite how to work with the past, so it doesn‚Äôt bother me too much. But other people are different and have strong opinions."	12csh3r	trans	3	1.0	2023-04-05 17:56:44
I'm just so pissed at my classmates right now	"Now some context before my view on it: third hour English, I'm tired as all fuck, and not paying attention to my/""our"" teacher help us with word forms(words to help write our paper so we arent repeating the same words over and over) to use on our debate paper, but the one topic that woke me up is none other than ""transgender people in the military"" and the teacher asks: ok, ummm are you for or against it?"" And the fucking kid decides to say in the cockiest voice and tone ever. ""Against..duh."" now that kinda set me off but I didnt care because everyone else besides my friend group is super Confederate and dont like people who are out of norms type people, but his reasons for it is what pissed me off. Teacher: so what are some reasons for you to be against it?"" Kid:""because it's a distraction, it's against Morales, it's against ethics, and its just a waste of space and people. They dont deserve to serve our country."" 

Now this fucking pissed me off so much to the point I started erasing absolutely nothing on my paper, literally a blank paper and I burned through half my fucking eraser because I didnt want to blow a fucking gasket on this stupid fuck... and then he has the ordasity to then say quote ""if I knew anyone who was trans, I'd personally smack them and torture them."" And that's when I couldn't take it anymore. Instead of anger, I felt super dysphoric and I wanted to immediately go and fucking cry in the bathroom but I couldn't because that would raise suspicion and I didnt want to have that negative shit against me....welcome to my daily life in North Dakota!!! Please I need help cheering up. "	"That guy has at least 8 tabs of trans porn open in his browser at any given time, guaranteed. 

Take comfort knowing you're better than these people. Focus on school right now and when you can move to a more progressive area. Stay safe.
Yeah there are some guys that were talking loudly in the halls asking why they need a day for trans people and why did they not have a day for strait people I shouted shut up and went to class
I know it's super corny to reply to something like this with a quote but there was a good post recently about a quote by the Buddha that went something like this:

>If someone gives you a gift and you refuse to accept it, to whom does the gift belong?

In a nutshell, don't respond. Toxic people exist and you can't win with them, it's best to just let there insult stay with *them.* If their insult doesn't get any reaction - their insult will belong to them. Besides, it seems by the pseudoaggressive tone in the words that a reaction is exactly what they want and by giving them attention you'll be thwarted.

Don't respond to someone using loud words - it's exactly what they want.

I'm trying to, it's hard though cause of my area, but I only have 63 days of my last year! Hopefully everything goes better...
That tis true hence why I didnt say anything to him
I grew up in a very blue collar area in the 1990s. No one was openly gay and the word ""transvestite"" was still being used widely. Toxic masculinity was everything in high school culture but that shit doesn't get you far in the real world, except maybe in a few isolated fields. 

I know school seems like the world now but it really isn't. You'll get out, move on, and that loser will be a distant memory. And best of all, you'll he in control of your life so that you can surround yourself with loving, supportive people.

how to comfort a gender dysphoric friend	"Kind of a ramble sorry

I have a trans man friend and i am very clueless on how to comfort them. Right now they are spiraling about not being a cis boy and i have no idea how to comfort them on that. I asked my other transmasc firend about it and he told me to just be there for them but it feels wrong just not saying anything... 

it seems like he is in a mourning of a person he never could be but in my idea its not impossible?? Like he has said mutliple times that he hates being trans he just wants to be cis so telling them he is valid and their feelings are valid just angers him more... anytime me and other friends try to.comfort them he shuts us off and says we dont understand his situation his dysphoria

Another point is how hard it is to transition in this country, having to go through so much trials and he is a cripplingly anxious boy so he doesnt even feel like he could ever get the life he wants... our friendgroup has egged him on and encouraged him to contact trans support groups that we have in our country but he shuts these ideas off very quicly cause he says he knows its impossible, he cant talk to them cause of anxiety

I have also offered going to these places together as im more sociable and could help him exrpress is feelings but it doesnt feel right invading these spaces meant for trans people

My last option is to gather all my transmasc friends and hold a roundtable so that he could see that living as a man is possible for him if he strives towards it, but zi feel he would not like it..."		10854tf	trans	3	1.0	2023-01-10 08:56:23
Adhd and feeling invalid and deadname at work vent	"I keep running into transfemmes who talk about how they didn't realise they could have adhd (or autism) until they came across the ""girl"" symptoms. And I didn't realise until I came across those symptoms either. But I'm transmasc and it feels so fucking invalidating to know that despite being socialised as boys they reacted and their symptoms manifested more like their actual gender, but mine didn't?? 

Like I was two different people in and out of school, paralysed by fear of getting into trouble breaking one of the many rules I didn't understand, I only ever did schoolwork in front of any adults at school, so of course they thought I was a model child. Did all the mirroring shit, all the classic ""girl"" symptoms. Bc all the expectations on me were girl ones and I felt lost and like I couldn't trust my own instincts bc it always upset someone

It just fucking sucks and makes me feel like shit


Also how the fuck am I supposed to hold down a job when my burnout involves so much rage ??? I cannot hold it together when clients are being total cunts and expecting me to magically solve problems as soon as they come up. Literally want to climb through the phone and throttle them. Like the others at work use their anger as a shield and keep up that customer service voice, but I cannot stop my emotions getting into my tone of voice. And my mind blanks I don't have the polite words to give them. Doesn't help that I have to use my deadname at work ""Hi, am I speaking to Laura?"" No she doesn't exist fuck off."		qgsm73	trans	3	1.0	2021-10-27 09:20:34
I don't know if I should drop my trans friends for being kind of transphobic	Okay, so this story is kind of old and I did mention it in a comment giving someone else advice. But a couple years ago I came out as non binary, (a couple years later I came out as a guy), to one of my friends who was a trans guy. He then outed me to someone else and they had a discussion about how I couldn't be non binary because I was too feminine. This hurt like hell, and it still does years later. Neither of them told me but I did catch on after the person I hadn't come out to used they them pronouns for me and I made them explain the whole thing. I then spoke to the friend that outed me, and forgave him, but went back in the closet, setting my coming out years back and giving me a really bad identity crisis that was horrible to go through. This was years back, and he now knows the error of his ways and non binary people can be feminine instead of gender neutral, but I still think of it and it still causes me so much pain and anger and I've never really resolved it.  I brought it up with him again but again forgave him. This was yeard ago but I don't know what to do. I'm not friends with the other friend anymore but I don't know what to do with the current one. Does anyone have any advice?		wysum3	trans	3	1.0	2022-08-27 03:54:09
My bully from middle school just posted a picture that reads ‚ÄúAll of the bullies in my life are ugly people now‚Äù	"Thing is, he bullied me lots and back in those days homophobic insults were common, especially towards me being a ‚Äúskinny boy‚Äù with long hair (I knew I was trans since I was 7) so I guess I was an easy target. It was a long time ago but he had a sharp tongue and a mean attitude with a popular air about him, and I was new kid. 

Well, he is trans too. He cried before graduation because the school FORCED HIM TO WEAR A DRESS. I knew every singe day that he bullied me, it was because he recognized my pain and didn‚Äôt have any other way to vent his anger and frustration about being trapped in the wrong body. So he attacked me with homophobic and transphobic and racist insults to make himself feel better. 

Him and I never took a single gym class for 2 years because we were too afraid of the change rooms - honestly we should have been very close friends if it wasn‚Äôt for him being the ugly one. 

I‚Äôm happy that he found his way, and I called him out for bullying me. I got a half baked apology from him, and I quote ‚ÄúI did it to hide the fact that I‚Äôm a you-know-what‚Äù and after telling him I forgave him every day back then I got no reply. 

There is no point other than to vent about my life and how this bullying thing has come full circle. Now that there‚Äôs trans healthcare in the region for youth (but not for adults, we have to drive 5 hours to Toronto for that‚Ä¶) I hope that the current generation doesn‚Äôt have to deal with that messed up scenario where 2 trans kids are torturing each other for existing in the same place because they‚Äôre too afraid to come out."		su1t2f	trans	3	1.0	2022-02-16 17:43:24
I'm afraid and i dont know what to do. (This is a VERY long post)	"I was raised in an emotionally decent place until I turned 14 or so and then the house was a mess. My step father had left and a fourth child was along the way after my mother had slept with an old friend of hers. We moved, fast forward to the birth of the fourth one named (for privacy's sake, names will be changed.) Jeremy, we found out after an entire year that he has autism from his father, who at this point was romantically involved with my mother.  The house somewhat stabilized and everything has been going decently up until two years ago, when I was 16. 

Now, ever since I was still in puberty, I just felt weird and wrong about my boyness. There was something deep down that felt off and seemed to point towards my identity. I didn't know what it was at the time so I brushed it off and kept being ""Leo"". Fast forward some years, I'm in grade 10, high school years. I get a girlfriend. Absolutely wonderful being. We broke up. Huge wreck of a relationship. Skip ahead to two months later, I come out as gay (turns out I was bi but more into chicks) and get a boyfriend. Lots of fun, sex was great, and after 10 months, he dumps me. During all of this time, the feelings about myself and my identity were still very weird but I ignored them. Until I met some trans folk at this same high school. 

This is when that feeling grew into something that I could recognize. It grew and defined itself after I realized what exactly it was. It was always there but I had never known what to think of it, I had always had body image issues, but I never knew it was this.i liked wearing leggings, I liked how I looked in makeup and I liked dresses. And I always hated my body hair. Egg cracked.

I came out to my theatre group. It was well recieved. They supported and loved me. I came out to my best friends. They welcomed it all, even if I had to correct them sometimes. 

Later during the summer, I came out to my mom. She told me that she had a feeling about it and I was happy to know that she wasn't prejudiced. 

Or so I thought. I was 17 when she said ""Michelle Obama has a dick and her real name is michael"" or something like that. There have been ups and downs, like, really deep kinds of downs. And we talked and stuff and before we knew it she was talking to a doctor about me. The doctors said that I have to wait a year. I didn't want to wait, but I went with it. 

Aside from trans stuff, the house had had some awful times. Yelling. Groundings, name calling, denial, transphobia, homophobia and ignorance. Nearly everyone at school had been fine with me. The administration was a grey area but the head councilor was absolutely awesome. It home that was the problem. It wasn't the worst thing in the world though.

Skip to my 18th birthday, (I'm still not legally an adult, I live in BC, Canada.) Two years AFTER I came out as trans. I told my mom that I want her to stop deadnaming me. It was a start. Now, at this point, she has told me that the doctors been saying to wait a year, still. Even after socially transitioning and shit. It was them that I felt like something was fucky. I haven't talked to the doctor personally. I needed to talk to the doctor personally because there either, isn't even a doctor, or she's just been telling him things that aren't entirely true. I've been asking her to provide me a number but she won't. She dodges the question, changes the subject, and when I press, she gets angry. 

She's currently pregnant with a fifth kid. From the father talked about earlier. I cant be entirely angry with her because she's preggers and emotional. But she hasn't shown any signs of giving a shit about my emotions. I have told her that I need help I need a therapist to help me through this. She said, ""this is your thing, you deal with it yourself. You want to end up like your grandfather? Not being able to make his own appointments.""

It's not like that. I need help starting because I don't know where to start. I have social anxiety. I can buy myself things but I can't talk to someone I don't know on the phone unless I want to have regrettable awkwardness and fear of rejection for something so huge to me.

And here's the kick, for these years, whenever I'm at home, I'm afraid to fuck up. I feel like I can't make any mistakes. I have to do all of my chores and say all of my words carefully lest I get punished with anger detest, and removal of my only ways to communicate with the world. 

A few nights ago, she deadnamed me with intention. She does it when she thinks I can't hear and she misgenders me whenever she talks about me. I feel like a fake. Like I can't be or won't ever be an average girl. 

When she deadnamed me, that was the nail in the coffin
 
It's not her forgetting and correcting herself. It's her stating what she thinks about me.

Have you ever seen one of those films that the shy and nerdy girl finally gets positive attention, invited to prom, becomes prom queen and then gets pig blood dumped on her in front of everyone? 

That's what it felt like. I thought I was making progress and making my way and that people were coming around. 

It was all for show. All to humour me and my fucked up perception of myself and the world. I wish I could take back every hug I had ever given my mother. And I want to tell her that too. But I'm afraid that I can't reach out to professionals and I'm afraid that she will make my life hell.

TL;DR, my mom doesn't support me like she said she did and I only figured it out now. I want to leave asap but I can't reach out on my own because of fear that I will fail"	"This going to be difficult where you are, but you need to start preparing to remove the toxicity from your life. With what you've described, she is unlikely to ""come around"" on the truth of you being trans. It sounds like you've got a community of support other than her and that's awesome! Lean into that.

As far as not feeling like you're really trans, this is imposter syndrome and everyone faces it at some point and about some aspect of their life, except probably narcissists :D Most cis people have it about their careers. Trans individuals tend to have it for their gender identity...and also in their careers! :D

Serious Question	I hope someone can help me. My brother(who was born a girl) fully transitioned a few years ago. Ever since we were children, he‚Äôs always gushed about being a mother and having children. I recently got pregnant and I‚Äôm very excited but my brother is not. When I asked if he would help me plan my baby shower(he‚Äôs a wedding planner so I figured he could give me some insight on my baby shower), he got really upset. Saying I‚Äôm running my pregnancy in his face and that he hates that he got a hysterectomy because now his hopes of birthing a child are ruined. Before he got the hysterectomy and bottom surgery, I spoke with him about pregnancy and possibly freezing his eggs. I suggested that maybe he postpone his surgeries until he had a child or even found a surrogate since being a parent is very important to him. He got really upset that time as well, saying that if he didn‚Äôt get the surgeries now that he‚Äôd regret it. He also gets really angry at my fianc√© and actually gets on him for ‚Äúbeing able to actually produce sperm and get women pregnant‚Äù. I really need some advice on how to handle him and this situation. I don‚Äôt want to seem insincere or like I‚Äôm invalidating his feelings. Our family has been very open to his transition and my dad even paid for it and I helped care for him during his healing. I don‚Äôt know where this anger is coming from and I don‚Äôt want to assume anything. Can someone please help?	"Oh wow. He should be happy for you, not angry. I‚Äôm guessing he‚Äôs just really dysphoric. Im sorry you have to deal with that, though.
thats so shitty i dont even know what to say:( its not okay for trans people to put down cis people just because they can do what we cant. Im MTF and personally yes i would LOVE to be able to have all the working parts that i should. But im not going around telling other lovely women to fuck off because they can. I LOVE girlsü•∞‚ú®. So maybe try and have a serious and calm conversation about this anger and hostility and explain that youre not trying to rub anything in and that you love your brother and just want to share your beautiful life experiences with him. Especially because its his niece/nephew/etc that you are carrying"	tgrvch	trans	3	0.8	2022-03-18 03:14:42
How do I control my anger when it comes to transphobes	"So I am a high school student and last year was my first year of high school. It also happened to be my first school year out as a trans man. It was horrible and I don't particularly want to get into the traumatic parts but I was harassed and bullied constantly and so was my trans girlfriend. This one girl in particularly has been at it and is STILL messing with me and her. First day she was at the school she said out loud ""That girl looks like she has a dick."" Fast forward to the beginning of this school year, she befriended me and I forgave her. Then one day, she found out magically I go by he/him and take testosterone even though I have totally talked to her about it. She said she will call me he/him but said to my face I will always be a girl. I have a track record with making terrible friends but this was so funny to me how she even bothered to interact with me. Recently she's been saying everything my girlfriend goes in the bathroom while she's in the bathroom ""there's a guy in the bathroom!"" I wish I could say that's where the torment ended. A week or 2 ago she commented on an Instagram post that mentioned me being a guy in the caption saying ""But don't u have a pussy üíÄ"". Present day, she has been calling out to my genderfluid friend repeatedly saying ""Oh hey look an emo!"" I'm so close to resorting to violence and I need guidance. üôè üò≠"	"I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this shitty child. Try not to sink to her level, because if you do then she wins regardless. Have you reported this harassment to anyone?
I've given up on trying to report it from my horrible experiences try to last year when reporting. It really sucks üò≠
What horrible experiences? I‚Äôm sorry, I‚Äôve had my own fair share of trouble with bullies and the system not doing anything when I was a kid.

If you don‚Äôt mind me asking, are you in a particularly less trans-friendly area? Could you keep escalating and try going to someone higher? Try to get things in writing so you have proof of reporting it and there being a lack of action
Well I'm not new to bullying and last year I did the only thing I need how and reported so much and they still had the audacity to not call it bullying. My trans girlfriend attempted suicide at school and still gets made fun of for it when really its their fault she did it. I'm definitely in a small town trans hating area. I have screen shots of the online things but other than that, things are not proven to be true, hence why I don't feel like trying anymore. Like just recently some under classmen have been saying my name and greeting me in the hallway and thinking it's the funniest shit. Nobody gets it and thinks they are just being nice and the ones who do are trans or have been bullied. I just don't get it and it's really hard to wake up and go to school everyday. Last semester 2 freshmen girls were saying  ""Hi (deadname)!"" And I can't tell u how many times I've been on people's snapchats making fun of me :,D Sorry for the ""vent"". I don't have a therapist anymore or a psychiatrist (I haven't had my adhd medication in months) and it's really making it hard to do anything.
Aww I‚Äôm sorry, ugh high schoolers can be such little shits, not all of them so I mean no offense to you. I wish I could do more to help, but it doesn‚Äôt last forever and it does get better. Just do your best to try to preserve your peace and don‚Äôt give them the reaction they‚Äôre looking for, eventually they‚Äôll get bored and move on.

No need to apologize for venting either, completely warranted! I also know the struggle of being off ADHD meds, it feels bad, I hope you can get back on them soon.
forgot to mention, the school in a roundabout way basically said it was my fault she attempted

I'm mostly a lone wolf I tend to like to have the space and do things my way when I want to which is good, but.... I've been feeling lonely alot lately and i try and shake it off and go about my business but it tend to not work, i just want  someone to hold me and cuddle with but in just constantly fighting  myself over this. When i go to work i keep it positive 97% of the time but sometimes i just cant. I feel like slapping  the taste out of the next person  that does it, I feel and have the anger of a sith lord....

I‚Äôm happy that I won‚Äôt have to hide who I am anymore but I don‚Äôt feel the full victory of the moment because I have the anger from standing up to my abusive father in my heart and I‚Äôm scared of what they‚Äôll say. I did it through text because I don‚Äôt live in the same house as them so I‚Äôm not in immediate physical danger right now, but I do live a trailer beside them but idk we will see. I just turned 18 a few days ago and I was just so tired and fed up with hiding and being abused. I ran away from home to live with my ex girlfriend for almost the entire past year and she was very abusive as well so I finally left after being manipulated and guilted into coming back time and time again so I‚Äôm just fucking fed up with everything. Everybody who is supposed to love me only ends up abusing me and I‚Äôm scared to live my life as a trans women because I know it only gets harder.

They want to meet	"Ever since I came out as gender fluid it has been easier for me to express that side of myself online. People just accept me as female online and I usually don't come out to them as trans because I've always noticed that even when people are cool with me being trans they don't trat me like a woman anymore. It's subtle but they start treating me like a trans male to female in little but noticeable and very frustrating ways. 

I know a lot of you are probably thinking ""Catfish!"" but I don't use this online space to lead people on. I may be flirtatious but I'm actually in a committed monogamous relationship in the real world so if anyone ever starts to take things beyond flirtation I gently remind them I'm taken. 

I've actually made a lot of friends online and we have had some deep conversations where we've helped each other with our real world problems and I do deeply care about a lot of these people. 

Recently, however, one of my closest friends actually has an opportunity, and really wants to meet me in person. And I mean I'd love to meet him too and talk but, I am stuck with this very clearly male body.  He'll be coming through the area by the end of next month and I am terrified.

We've spoken about trans issues before and he seems like a very supportive guy but I thibk that he'll react with anger when he discovers I am geneticly male . . . He'll feel betrayed and I can't blame him, I've been lying to him after all. . . 

I seriously have no idea what to do. If he finds out, everyone will know, best case scenario, everyone will treat me differently, worst case scenario, they'll all hate me for being deceitful."	"I think the first step is to determine if you really have been lying to him. Did you use a false photo? When he meets you, will he be meeting a man?

Unless you are part of a gynecology forum (or a sex chat room) people are probably accepting you as a woman as opposed to as female.

Unless you are part of a genealogy forum or, idk, stormfront, no one cares about your genetics.

If you led him to believe you are a woman, and you are a woman, there's no lying.

If you led him to believe you are a woman all the time, and you are only a woman some of the time, then there is a bit of a lie.

Betrayal occurs when the whole relationship hinged on something that you change. We are allies, the whole relationship hinges on us fighting together. You switch sides, you've betrayed me! You tell me that you don't like me, you haven't betrayed me. Our relationship was never about liking each other.

So unless your whole relationship to this group hinges on the fact that you have certain sex characteristics, or that you would be 100% honest about your sexual characteristics, then there cannot be a betrayal. 

That being said, if you don't feel comfortable meeting him you don't have to. Do what you need for yourself."	7ycgs2	trans	1	0.57	2018-02-18 05:47:22
