They want us gone		"They want to ban college bathrooms? Will I have to go off campus to take a dump? /s

What the actual fuck are these bills? It literally doesn‚Äôt affect anything to have unisex toilets and HRT should be a discussion between patient and provider, not lawmakers and lobbyists‚Ä¶

[One bill which will be heard today is a ban targeted at litterboxes in schools. Something that does not exist and something that was a hoax by Libs of TikTok.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617895876235759621?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)



I literally cannot believe the people who MAKE our laws still believe that litterbox bullshit. They spent a huge amount of effort making that bill. Think about all the other shit they legislate on.



[He claims when trans people compete in sports, they nearly always win. and he's like... really wrong? Most trans people do not come close to winning titles, championships, etc.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617904662774157312?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)

[We've had trans people competing for decades and it's fairly rare that they dominate sports.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617904662774157312?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)
I don't know what to do.   I know I need to stay informed, but every time this happens its retraumatizing.   I just want to be able to live and be happy.
So fucking much for ""a free country"" when we can't even have basic rights. God, I hate America so much.
We live in an actual NIGHTMARE
self care isn't enough i need transphobic politicians to suffer
Transitioning saved my life in a way no mood stabilizers ever did. I can't be alone.

If I had to detransition I would likely be dead in a week, self inflicted but a victim of someone else's hands.

I'm against the government pushing medical bills. Against them forcing in either direction any sort of treatment. Not giving or taking. The government and their medical corporation overlords need to stay out of peoples lives.

If someone wants to ferment skunk secretions mixed with essence of cow dung and a drop of cerebral spinal fluid of a monk fish, go on then for all I care since either none of my business.

Throwing out people's rights and in some cases lives for their religious political ideologies that obviously don't fit those they're imposing . . . um.

Um??

""The First Amendment prohibits the Congress from making a law ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the incorporation of the First Amendment.""

Does this not work both ways? The constant argument is always centered around religion.

This works for all religions, right? 

 But what about those whose existences are seen as abominable for certain religions?

It's a witch hunt. When did that start being acceptable again?

The amendments mean nothing if they only protect some and of those protected people use their protections against minority groups. This is such a stereotype of America -_-
‚ÄòLand of the free‚Äô my ass
""NOOO TRANS GENOCIDE ISNT REAL WDYM VICTIM COMPLEX REEEEEEEE""

/s
I hate this country so much
I‚Äôve legit had people on Reddit tell me the phrase ‚Äútrans rights‚Äù bothers them because we supposedly already have rights. With politicians imposing bills like these all over the country, that is demonstrably false. Fuck this.
Well, I was thinking about HRT, but Florida isn't looking much better for this shit. Fuck me.
I live in north dakota, I am fucking terrified rn.
They should ban unisex bathrooms and then we can all storm their houses and put them under citizen‚Äôs arrest for having unisex bathrooms

Either way I highly suggest trans people in North Dakota take advantage of their lax firearm ownership laws üëÄ
The US is a joke country
So I travel through ND regularly and I often stop at gas stations and restaurants that have single stall all gender washrooms. Will those be illegal under these new laws?
They want to ban gender neutral washrooms?
Religion is to blame.  Trans people make Religious people question their faith, and they don't like it.
I feel for my trans friends in the USA. It‚Äôs unreal that a country commends itself on freedoms, well isn‚Äôt this a violation of the constitutional right to freedom. It‚Äôs hard to wrap my head around. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm in Canada. Love you all‚Ä¶
God I need to leave this fucking country
i seriously want out of this fuckin country
my two-ton gas-hogging hellbeast is itching to turn transphobes into roadkill, i just might let her have what she wants üòè
People living in that state need to get involved in local politics.
Young people and mostly lgbtq people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like‚Äù politics but is literally the reason why the country became a medieval holy kingdom.
Local politics are way more important than what most people assume.
What excuse can they *possibly* have to ban a bathroom that has ONE toilet inside it????
Are we all just gonna ignore CONVERSION THERAPY
Something is gonna break. Even my co-wokers who don't care about trans people are beginning to raise their eyebrows at this stuff.
Yeah. The GOP wants us exterminated like roaches, and they'll stop at nothing to get it. I have to imagine we'll eventually get to a point where they'll actually try, as much as I hate to say it. People always tell me ""it's 2023, nobody cares, get over yourself"" when shit like this is happening. I confronted a friend the other day about making anti-trans jokes, because he made a joke that implied I had no rights, and I told him that it hurt me because in some states, I don't have rights. His response? ""You don't live in those states, so it's not a problem"" and ""just don't go to those states then"". After a little bit of back and forth, he said ""it's 2023, nobody gives a shit"". It's people with that mentality that are going to get us killed. If they keep dismissing it and pretending like it doesn't exist, then that's just giving the GOP more power and freedom to do what they wish with us since they don't have as much clap back as they should.
And these are the same people who'll say ""Love thy neighbor"" It doesn't seem like they are loving thy neighbor
This... This right here is why I want to head to the demon realm! It's plenty better than planet earth at this point
We need to stand up against those tyrants, if we won't, we will eventually even lose our freedom to live.
What sort of dystopian bs is this? People really do spend their time, effort, and money in literally the worst way when it comes to trans rights. They could use this money to improve so many things, not just in the realm of trans rights, but other issues, and yet their bigotry and hate leads them to use it like this? Wtf is wrong with people, I've never been more glad to not live in the US
We are elemental. We are a force of nature. We will grow back forever when their buildings are rubble. Deprive us of even the most basic resources and we will still self-actualize. And we will never not fight them united.
This is so sad. :(
Fuck North Dakota
This is horribly misspelled. It is clearly supposed to say ‚ÄúIn just 20 minutes, North Dakota will debate declaring war on trans people. I will be here livetweeting‚Äù
Get your passports‚Ä¶
Conversion therapy is literal torture. How the fuck can you legalize that?!?!
There is nothing about America that I like. Nothing. And I judge the country by their actions. 

Germany are now the good guys and Americans are the nazi fascists. 

What a time to be alive. üôÑ
They don't want trans people gone, they want them to be the minority to blame, sadly, similar to what Nazi germany did with the Jewish peoples.
I feel terribly sry for every Trans Person living in North Dakota:/
North Dakota has less than a million people. Let's all move there and fuck up their voter demography for the lols.
And yet they wonder why nobody cares about their stupid ass bumblefuck state!!! Fuck North Dakota!
Why dose the US suck so much?

I just wanna be a cute girl and have cuddles damnit. qwq
I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed here, but‚Ä¶maybe it‚Äôs time we organize. Consider the state of racial inequality and overt violence toward people of color post-WWII‚Ä¶now think, ‚ÄúThe Black Panther Party for Self-Defense‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not familiar, maybe get familiar. They‚Äôre responsible for things like free breakfast at school and free sickle cell anemia testing. They realized the cold hard facts of being brutalized and murdered by their own government and fought back. Maybe it‚Äôs time for us to fight back, particularly if they‚Äôre going to try to kill us anyway.
Y'all need gay people rioting in the streets
Remember friends, it is easy to aquire agency increasing materials in the USA. You just need to be willing to put in the work.
They can't even enforce half of these.
Honestly...what bad, horrific thing have we done to deserve this? I just want to live my life in peace.
Hello, I'm not American. How the fuck does banning establishments from organizing their bathrooms however the fuck they want fit with ""free country""?
I hate my home state so much. North Dakota has always been disappointing. It just has been getting progressively worse. The only reason to come here is that you want a cheaper place to live and to drink your face off.
So would that ban all single stall bathrooms like ones intended for people with disabilities cause it‚Äôs gonna get a lot of people screwed over. I see that causing outrage they don‚Äôt expect
Science!
If there's ever like a GoFundMe to send Erin and her girlfriend on a tropical vacation I will donate to it in a moment. Her work documenting all this stuff must be so draining.
so tired of this.
I know it‚Äôs being pedantic and not at all what they meant, but wouldn‚Äôt banning unisex bathrooms mean that bathrooms are required to allow multiple sexes in?

Why does unisex mean gender neutral?
I cannot believe I am saying this, but I am beginning to appreciate TERF island, despite its imperfections.
Sigh. As a truck driver I'm going to have to eventually openly walk around with a weapon in these states, using the men's bathroom (I still use it but don't pass)
alright so all houses have to have gendered bathrooms ig
Fucking hate living in the upside down
Ban college bathrooms? Like all together? Colleges can‚Äôt have toilets?
Republucan politics are hate politics, against American minorities.
What! They want to ban ALL college bathrooms??
Ik they might not like you all but wtf
‚ÄúLand of the free‚Äù
Let‚Äôs just go ahead and ban bathrooms all together why don‚Äôt we all just piss on the fucking floor
Those mf wont stop us from being who we want to be
Why would you ban anyone from a unisex bathroom? It‚Äôs fucking unisex
So they'd need gendered bathrooms in their houses now?

But in all seriousness, this makes me so mad. üò≠
Wow. I don‚Äôt get why we can‚Äôt just be ourselves. And they are making conversion therapy legal? It‚Äôs not therapy it‚Äôs traumatic abuse.
How can everything go so backwards. üò¢
I say we legalize conversion therapy and use it on christian nationalists to make them not shit ass people‚Ä¶ my god what in the hell is going on in this country
only if us Americans would protest like the French we would get somewhere
i started reading through what she was saying on it and literally had to stop for my own mental health, it‚Äôs bad, yall
They don‚Äôt want us using any bathroom at all not even a single restroom
""When they show you who they are, believe them"" said Maya Angelou. Well the fascists really have shown us who they are.
Was stationed in noeth dokota for 5ish years the bible freaks are so awful
Question: what will this entire community do if legislation is never passed and you aren't given the rights you want/deserve. What is the next step?
""Free country"" my ass
wait couldn‚Äôt someone with wisdom write up a law and propose it just like these wackos did?
I'll get the torches and pitchforks...
Shit like this makes Colorado look like paradise compared to the rest of the US...
Conversion therapy?!?!?! Wtf???? Did they forget how awful that sh*t ended up in the 50s? It never works and is just bs!!!!
Jesus Damn...
I think it‚Äôs disgusting that any state would go out of their way to outlaw a group of people. But if straight people and all the closeted freaks want ND, maybes it best if we let them have it.
Where we are going to do our ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù? Our own bathroom at home are unisex. So these people want us to hold at the university until we can find where to do it? Conversion to what? To be transphobic? So trans youth have to live a lie? Is it lying a sin? Is it one of the 10 commandments ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself‚Äù?  ü§î
We need to build bonds within our local communities and organize. üñ§
This is genocide.
I don't know how Erin does this without going mad. She's constantly on top of all this depressing news while it only takes me a glance at one of her tweets before I'm done for the day. Erin if you see this, thank you
Non of this should be ‚Äúdebatable‚Äù just leave us TF ALONE I‚Äôm soooooo over it..
It is insane how public the hate has become. It‚Äôs almost surreal to think SO MANY PEOPLE are blindly repeating history over and over-
Pretty sure I'm not allowed to promote crimes so...
Everybody make sure ""not"" to do anything drastic involving explosives
Thanks ‚ô°
Are these red states ever gonna redeem themselves?
Personally I have no plans of sitting back and letting them
Seeing stuff like this makes me wanna just roll over 
I guess if they want me gone so bad I‚Äôll go back to presenting more fem 
I don‚Äôt want to do that but I‚Äôm so tired of this
I want to vomit literally all over the place. Fuck this shit
this is actually absurd
why
But but but trans kids are all just evil perverts who go through so much pain and want to end their lives because they want to get in the other sexes pants üò¢
I wish for exactly the same to be done to these people as they wish for me. I will not elaborate further.
I was born in North Dakota. They are a hateful state unless your straight, cis, and white. The whole state is one big white trash trailer park. I moved to South Dakota because it's so much nicer here. Come to find out we are the same thing here. 

Fuck the Dakotas back wood bullshit.
We just need to build an island where the LGBT community is allowed and no one else cause we can't seem to live with anyone not in the community
Could their agenda be any clearer now
So for those that don't have ovaries/testes, how are we supposed to live without hrt. We need hormones to keep our body healthy, wether we're transitioning or not. I'm mtf and I can't even get hrt for testosterone tho???
It may get bad, before it gets better, we need to stay vigilant and keep fighting for our rights, time will put them on the wrong side of the civil rights movement.  As with the fight for women's rights, black rights gay rights now us, seems the government just wants something to fight, they inevitably lose
Erin is doing amazing work for the trans community! Thank you!
Why does society hate us?
I'm fearful for my future, I hope I turn 18 before any bans on young people's hrt over here in the UK if we're headed down that road too
This is terryfying
Is this some sort of stupidity contest with South Dakota?
These fuckers really do. I'm so sorry.

I feel scared for those of you in the US, I keep seeing these bills in this state, that state...

And I feel powerless. Is there anything I can do from outside to help?
Hello american Taliban!
sadness. seems like the states really isnt the place to go to once i graduate at this rate.
I live in Italy thank God üíÄ
Meh, we don‚Äôt need North Dakota. 49 states is plenty.

The first steps of genocide

'But Jesus said...' (No, he didn't)
As a watersports fetishist I support the ban on college bathrooms, people can piss on the floor or in their pants as they wish /s
This is just full genocidal hate. No laws need or should exist outlining how trans people can and cannot use their bodies. 

The sports bullshit is a non sequitur ‚Äúissue‚Äù. Phobes throw all these what if hypotheticals and no hard, concrete proof. When the answer is this: cis women caught ‚Äúdoping‚Äù serve x time and allowed to compete. Should be the same for trans women. Enough said.
> I literally cannot believe the people who MAKE our laws still believe that litterbox bullshit. 

they don't, at least most of them. but they know it will get them votes
The bar is very low for state lawmakers and most of them are mostly influenced by local extremists. 

Getting involved with local politics is the best way to combat this in your area.
Hi, so I live in ND.   How can I do anything to stop this?
fucking LITTERBOX BAN IN SCHOOLS???? a ban for a thing that never even happened??!??? the people who run america are actually stupid as fuck
I think some or most of the people involved in writing these bill know exactly what it is - its used to stoke the fires of hate in the gullible.
i mean there was at least 1 case of a litter box in a classroom, but it‚Äôs not for the reason LoTT says. [It‚Äôs ACTUALLY for students to use in case of an active shooter](https://www.insider.com/colorado-teachers-get-human-litter-boxes-for-lockdowns-2019-8?amp) but they‚Äôd never openly admit that
Can you please provide the source for the bill regarding the litterboxes?
Tf is a litter box
yeah, same here

i just want to live out the rest of my days peacefully as a woman, without having to worry about shit like this and basically having to be a step up above 90% of the people i talk to.
You don't have to keep reading the news. What good is it doing anyone to hurt yourself in this way? 

Let the people who are able fight these bills. You don't need to listen so closely to it. Find some other way to change the world a little. Maybe there's a local group trying to protect a small area of wildlife. Maybe there's something else.
Literally..
America as a ""free country"" has always been a lie. Just ask anyone who is not a straight, white, Christian male.
IKR! How am I supposed to keep living here without constantly getting more miserable every time I hear an outrageous news story like this?! PROGRESS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO GO BACKWARDS LIKE THIS! WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BECOME BETTER OVER TIME! THIS IS INSANE!!
It will get only worse though.
There's three of us.
Just three of us.
There's him and you and me
there's three of us

edit: damn someone beat me to it
With the amount of suffering they cause millions? Yeah i say its only fair they feel a world of pain
They've never felt what actual oppression is like and if they did they would never have the brain wrinkles to make the connection that other people can feel feelings too. I'm afraid if we flipped this on them they would use it as fuel to be Christian nationalist martyrs

They refer to people as NPCs like it's cool to normalize being a fucking psychopath and having no empathy
They should suffer much more than we do.
Go to their house and \[removed by Reddit\]
Does the morality of torture depend on the context...?ü§î

/j, i don't condone torture against anyone but do I think they deserve it? Probably...
They will hun. The same people that think God will smite us will take care of them. I believe God sends transphobes and homophobes to hell for their hate. Just my own beliefs.
You sure that ain't just self care?
if i remember correctly (and i'm pretty sure i do) there was a case that went to the supreme court that ruled that yes there is freedom of religion but not freedom from religion. so basically in short, they can practice whatever crazy ass bullshit belief they want for their angry sky daddy but the rest of us with a functioning brain have to sit back and be subjected to it regardless of our beliefs.
It's only free for those politicians to be honest. We need to makes sure it will be the other way.
Anyone who argues with, or has a problem with the phrase ""trans rights"" is a bigot, full stop.
Smh, those are the Same people that get mad about black rights
I'm in Florida too but I have too much negativity in my life and don't watch the news... what should I be concerned about? üò¨ I mean, the governor clearly doesn't like the lgbtq+ community and is acting on it as much as he can, but I hadn't heard anything trans-specific. I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to pull this sh!t, too.
Don‚Äôt forget about DIY, that‚Äôs always an option as well. Also filing it under insurance as ‚Äúendocrine disorder not otherwise specified‚Äù.
I‚Äôm so sorry
you're not alone here, us trans north dakotans can protect each other ‚ù§Ô∏è
Unisex bathrooms? The often single occupancy restrooms that both genders can use? Damn, it is targeted and a genocide.
Or just leave that dreadful state
I doubt that the US will be the only country that will do this.
Yep, for Jesus.
I wonder if they ban them everywhere‚Ä¶. That would make the bathroom in your home illegal
Hate is not rational
we also make people question the hegemonic ideas of sex equals gender and those are fixed and stable (and that genitals somehow dictate personality) and somehow mutually exclusive
I think religion is a facet, but even religion doesn't explain prior sentiments toward transgender individuals. Look for example at the Public Universal Friend, an agender person in the 1800s who was a pastor until their death by edema, who has been criticized as a fraud at times but otherwise lived an ordinary life.

I think that there are modern cultural factors to blame. The rise of rugged individualism and anti-communist sentiments. Which leads to an enforcement of inheritance standards, ownership, and the nuclear family. Which leads to class division. Which leads to the commodification of sexuality and reproduction to protect resources and class. Which leads to the rise of resentment toward that commodity for wanting control of itself. Which leads to stricter gender roles around who is the obtainer and who is the obtainee of such commodities, and enforcing a clear and obvious standard as to which resources are worth obtaining (i.e., which ones have the ability to get pregnant and aren't a risk of becoming pregnant by other partners).

Transphobia, patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, racism, and more are inseparable from one another and part of a widespread milieu of negative cultural forces that have been building to a head for decades. The fear of communism stirred the generation currently still in control of the government into a fever. The Red Scare never ended.
Idk. A lot of transphobes I know are staunch reddit-type atheists, people who think they‚Äôre super ‚Äúrational‚Äù and think they‚Äôre science experts because they read a richard dawkins book once. I think that religion certainly fuels transphobia very severely, but unfortunately if religion magically disappeared, I don‚Äôt think transphobia would necessarily disappear with it.
I don't really see how it is. I only read the old testament, and there are no conflicts there.
It's not the cause, but often an excuse. Don't let transphobes hide behind religion
I'd specifically its the Christian and the Islamic religions honestly. The norse religion, hinduism, and buddhism are neutral at worst and celebratory of trans people at best.
I worked with a guy from Bosnia several years ago. Survived the war in the early 90s and fled his country and moved to several places in Europe before finally landing in the USA. He would tell me all the time how he would hear how free it is here but what bullshit that actually was. ‚ÄúI have music on at my house it‚Äôs 915 and police show up tell me I have to turn it down, this is free country?, in my country music on at night means party! Everyone cone over have good time! If cops show up they also there to party and have good time! You call this free, get out of here with that shit‚Äù lol I used to love just listening to him rant
america was only the land of the free for white men, the founding fathers were slave owners and refused to give black people ""inalienable rights"" because that would harm their plantations

its unsurprising america is terrible for minorities and my heart goes out to all our trans siblings suffering there
honestly im just glad i live in illinois its not the best but its a whole lot better than most places in the usa
The cruelty is the point. Their constituents care more about ‚Äúhurting the right people‚Äù than making any positive change in society or peoples‚Äô lives. And the politicians are happy to oblige.
...a return to out houses?
They just unbanned it in my state (wisconsin) the other week. Fucking awful
I truly hope you and your fellow fire elementals don‚Äôt.
""not caring"" is the best - if everyone were genuinely not caring, considering it a standard, would make my life way better.
Yep. Thats why politicians lobbying against us is so damaging. They make so many people unaware of how bad it is
""Love"" is the type of a word that lately doesn't exist as much as it's supposed to.
I have decided to believe Heaven and Hell exist, but the only thing differentiating them is who‚Äôs there, with ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù being a constant battle royals between conservatives with nobody but each other around to hate, and hell being everyone else building a society of immortals with actual civil rights. It‚Äôll definitely still have issues, but it‚Äôll be pretty chill.
The US also attempted genocide during WWII, but nobody remembers that because they won. This disgusting excuse for a country being full of nazis isn‚Äôt new.
The genocide has already began, we will not falter to their hate.
What a relief!
Please do I am so fucking scared rn
I‚Äôm not sure that would work.
Shit man,,, this may not be a bad idea
It's coming soon.
It's going to happen. History repeats itself.
The only one I see that they can't enforce is the college bathroom ban, the rest they absolutely can and will enforce, which is frightening to say the least.
It doesn't. They don't care. The cruelty is the point.
It's like banning hormone blockers

It's not even *just* for trans people :/,
She's an incredible human being.
They're so thoroughly convinced its a mental illness and 'you can be fixed'. It's funny because a lot of the same people will balk at the idea of therapy or treating mental issues with medication, insisting you just gotta be tougher, because 'past generations didn't have any of that shit', when really both mental illness and gender nonconformity (using this as a stand-in for anything queer) existed just as much back then, but society did a much more thorough job or ostracizing or otherwise ignoring them. There was a lot more 'aunt in the asylum' 'weird uncle' and 'cousin who died young' back then, that could have just been another person in society if society hadn't been that way.

It's always been this way, but now that society is finally starting to understand, even a little, some people are pushing back, because we're daring to change the status quo.
Lol they tried that before in liberia. It kinda turned out shitty
Appeal to your National leader's make them convince the American politicians to stop being dicks.
If they won't listen to the American people they might listen to people who know what they're talking about.
Ummmmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. America sucks yeah, but I dont think you realize just how bad it is in china. 


And even **IF** it were the case that they were more accepting, I‚Äôd still rather not live in a literal authoritarian hellhole.



Edit: this commenter is a tankie. Ignore them.
If you support our struggle, how about you keep your uninformed opinions out of this? What the heck do you know about gender and gender identity anyway. How about you actually listen to trans people?

And guess what. Not allowing a trans child puberty blockers *is* a life altering decision.

You're being transphobic and very degrading toward all trans people. You just don't believe that gender identity is a thing do you? Maybe educate yourself before you speak on this.
Hormone blockers are the opposite of a life altering decision. If they decide to stop, puberty will start as normal, just a delayed start. You can't undo puberty though. It's a reasonable compromise, leaving the decision until they turn 18 as to which kind of puberty they want to pursue.
Jesus would be so very disappointed
technically I think it was technically God (lord can mean God and Jesus) but, Do not go about spreading slander among your people ([Leviticus 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+19%3A16&version=NIV)) and love your neighbor as yourself. ([Leviticus 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A18&version=NIV))

I can already hear evangelical Christians complaining about my usage of the OT...
And even if he did, not everyone even believes he existed, and no one can prove it. So why are we making decisions based on what inviso-daddy in the sky; who will tell you he loves you in the same breath as pulling a Job on you (everyone should read the story of Job once in their lives. It'll prove to you why you SHOULDN'T follow Jehova/Yahwai) would want? It sounds like a ( debunked ) Stockholm Syndrom.

Hard PASS.
yup, people are fed lies that they believe because they WANT to be outraged because that's the culture that's been perpetuated since the cold war.
And it‚Äôs an easy win. Nobody is going to think a litter box is acceptable, which of course it isn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not even a thing in this context, but getting the ball rolling with a clickbait bill everyone can agree on and be outraged at makes it that little bit easier to roll into the next and subsequent bills that actually will harm people and actually do need to be opposed.

They are also starting with the youth as again - easy target, easy to create outrage, easy to get support behind as you can throw in hyperbole and if that doesn‚Äôt work you make up bullshit that people will believe despite zero evidence.  And on it goes. Get that lot through and you can start creating hell for adults. Other states and countries watch on, the conservatives see what works, what needs tweaking, they get ideas and they now have examples of precedents.

Meanwhile actual stuff is happening that needs actual legislation to actually help people and make a difference. Absolutely nobody will benefit from any of this other than the terfs having more ammunition and bigger smiles, and politicians using it to get more donations so they can hurt more people. The flip side is this will absolutely destroy lives, people will die, and so so many will suffer and struggle.

Stop the world please, I‚Äôm feeling sick and really want to get off now üòî

Former ND resident here! Best thing to do is get involved with your local precincts representatives. I‚Äôve brought issues up with them, and have seen them ask my question to the state legislature. If you can‚Äôt do that look, go east.

Not to mention a ""man"" choosing to identify as a woman brings into question the Xtian idea that men are inherently the superior gender.
There are many factors.  Mostly ignorance.  But, Religion preaches Man and Woman unity.  That's it.  No exceptions.  It's their Controlling heirarchy system that does not want us around, to lure the SHEEP away.  You either accept Christ and do his bidding, or you are the enemy.  It's become less life and death these days.  But in the days of old, if you want to survive, you assimilate with Christianity, or some other religion.  Or you get cast outside the walls to fend for yourself.
Religion is way more of a factor than anti communist sentiments are or were. Yikes
That sort of staunch atheism ironically becomes a religion in and of itself. ""Religion is bad for humanity, because Dawkins said so, and anyone who disagrees with Dawkins is wrong and should be punished for being wrong so that we may convert them to Dawkinsism.""
Impossible argument there.  Because if you are inferring Religion never was, then there is a possibility that transphobia never was.  

I still go to church occasionally, with my wife, or listen on line.  The message overall is good.  BUT, finding a good church is like finding a good therapist.  Some are good, some are horrible.
It‚Äôs not about the Bible. religious interpretations of the Bible by ‚Äúman‚Äù is to blame.
One‚Äôs freedom should not infringe on another. Just like your religious beliefs or lack thereof should not dictate how I have to live my life.

Hold on. I'm familiar with the genocide of Natice Americans between the 1500-1800s. Then the illegal imprisonment of Japanese Americans from 1942 to 1946. 

What was the attempted genocide?

Evangelicals often use the old testament to point at stuff they consider wrong and sinful. But then that same book of laws, Leviticus, also has passages about not eating pork or wearing mixed fibers and other archaic 4000 year old laws like that. In fact, although it's been decades since I went to church, I'm pretty sure there's an excerpt in the new testament where Jesus basically says the old laws and old covenant are obsolete.
It‚Äôs still important because other states copy legislation that passes.
Me. Because you can't change it for the better of you live in another state.
In this context
i mean not rly, but i thought that people would be more progressive nowdays, and not basically do shit that hither did but on a much smaller scale.

bcuz let's be real, society rly is de-evolving
I get it. It kind of feels like doing _anything_ is better than not. Even if that thing is just... being miserable about it.
Nope. That is why we must all become activists and fight for our rights because apparently it's our turn in the barrel.

If the first toilet you found in a public restroom was filled with shit and vomit to the point of being unusable, would you take it upon yourself to clean it with your own hands or would you just use another toilet?

Staying ends up being impossible eventually.  We‚Äôre seeing the beginnings of a railroad to get people out of fascist states.  Sometimes you have to leave everything behind to survive.
Oh really? What possibly could have given you that idea?
Yet they keep saying they do, but I doubt that Jesus would find those things fine.
Exackle. If masculinity is somehow 'better' why was I able to simply nope outta that
> But, Religion preaches Man and Woman unity.

Yeah but the originator of that was infant mortality first, plus commodification of reproduction in a scarcity society. Religion is just another byproduct and enforcement system though, not the originating cultural (and evolutionary) driver.

Now, the cultural driver is a fear of post-scarcity and generational habit-forming. Post-scarcity society is a threat to those who have power over a scarcity society, because it means that all of their generations and centuries of work to succeed in that society will become meaningless. So they manufacture scarcity and enforce the standards of their society more fiercely than before.

Edited to clarify language.
And ironically it's PRECISELY their anti-LGBTQ+ ideology that's driving people away. So what do they do? Double down of course.
Religion is and has always been a way for the powerful to control the meek. Assuming that religion comes from itself is for those who are actually religious. Humans created religion, for a reason.

It is unrealistic for my wife and I to pack up our lives and move rn, we've been planning moving as a long term goal but we're not in a spot to do so
Ok, puppet of the imperialist transphobic empire.
And there's the mentally ill card, right away :D

Some things don't change. If you wanted to educate yourself on this, you could. I'm not going to waste my time trying to inform you. It's ignorant people like you who help pave the way for trans genocide.

I suppose next you're going to tell me there's a cabal out there transing kids or whatever.
Next you're going to tell me brain isn't fully developed until 25, and argue for banning all trans healthcare until then too. Because this is just a lifestyle choice or whatever.

We're talking about *healthcare* for *trans youth*. How about not denying life-saving care for people? What are you basing your arguments on anyway, except your feelings? As I say, read up or keep your ignorant opinions out of this.
Yes they thought people were identifying as cats or something I don't know the whole story
Some schools keep litter around because it's very helpful in cleaning up messes like if a student vomits or something nasty spills. Someone, likely a teacher who knows this, or an incredibly ignorant parent who doesn't, intentionally spread the lie that it was for students to go to the bathroom in ""because look how insane trans people make things"".
There's a whole concept out there that middle/high school ""furries"" have demanded litterboxes to use the bathroom at their schools.

I'm sure a couple people have been quirky enough to actually try to do so, but in this case, it's essentially conservatives latching like pit pulls onto the concept as a ""slippery slope"" argument against trans minors. Basically, ""if we allow minors to transition and respect it, what's stopping us from allowing them to transition to animals???""

It's exactly the same ""slippery slope"" argument they used against gay marriage. Now we're gonna have to legally allow people to marry their horses/refrigerators/etc!
> i mean not rly, but i thought that people would be more progressive nowdays, and not basically do shit that hither did but on a much smaller scale.

People are. That's why all these bills are being introduced, the people who write them and agree with them know that the days of their ideology are numbered. The Millennial generation has become the largest voting bloc within the past two elections and Generation Z has the most voting power due to its' increased rates of political participation than previous generations. What do these two generations exhibit? Significantly increased rates of acceptance of LGBT people. This is why these politicians are acting so unhinged and revealing their hand - they're in their death throes right now. They're trying to make a mess of the apartment before getting forcibly evicted.

And the *""society rly is de-evolving""* stuff is the same reactionary rhetoric that conservatives and other regressives use and believe in. Take care that you don't fall into that same way of thinking, that's exactly how they want you to think so that you'll get bummed out and less likely to fight. There was no ""golden past"" that we can return to, and to suggest so is completely ignorant of history.

Things are so much better nowadays. To give an example, just in the past 10 years the requirement that most states had in 2013 for SRS to be done to change somebody's gender on their identifying documents has been removed in most states, it's just an administrative and legal process now. To give another example, many of our LGBT elders say that this tool we call the internet is something they could have never began to dream of when they were fighting for rights and acceptance. The internet and mobile phones allow us to achieve levels of communication, organisation, and activism that we never could before. It's nothing short of a miracle.
I didn't think stupid, ignorant, arrogant and delusional could co-exist in one body, then I look at my brother...
Yeah....
I second forcing politicians into hamster wheels.
Ah fair, how do you feel about hydrogen powered tanks?
Before I transitioned, I literally did this once. I went into the men‚Äôs room (mind you these are single occupancy) and it looked like a f‚Äôing murder scene. I moved right to the ladies room only to be yelled at by the store clerk for using the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù bathroom. There was no way, even in the Bible Belt where I lived at the time I was using that men‚Äôs room.
These are the same people who also support corporate greed despite greed literally being one of the 7 deadly sins in the Bible.
You know what's fucked? If they actually lived like Christ we would all be accepted for who we are.
If it was better men actually knew how to talk about their feelings.
None of that matters now......  The largest club in the world does not want us to exist.  They preach it weekly.  Even though they misread what their BIBLE says about us.
>Post-scarcity society is a threat to those who have power over a scarcity society, because it means that all of their generations and centuries of work to succeed in that society will become meaningless. So they manufacture scarcity and enforce the standards of their society more fiercely than before.

This reminds me so much of the Azadian Empire from The Player of Games. They had the technological means for a post-scarcity society like that of the Culture, but scarcity and hierarchical domination were artificially enforced so that their ancient power structures could continue to self-propagate.
good point
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to stay safe for the time being, and able to get out when you can (if that is what you want to do). We would love to have you on the west coast.
I thought those were in case there is a school shooting and a lockdown and children need to pee
yep i get ya, its defo better nowdays, but it is still saddening to see all this shit happen.
This was a breath of fresh air, thank you so much. I used to believe firmly in this and all these posts recently have gotten my anxiety up and I let myself get caught up in the rhetoric.

This grounded me again, thankyou.

Edit: Also wanted to remind everyone that we just got gay marriage ratified into the constitution y'all.
And you can‚Äôt see that the other side supports and benefits from that corporate greed just like them? Both sides are playing the same greed game with the general population getting screwed footing the bill without even a kiss.
Jesus sounds like the type of a guy that would accept everyone, and treat everyone equally.
supposedly they are, but are actively discouraged from doing so...too ""girly"" apparently...
That's because the Bible comes from them, they don't come from the Bible. The club is just a rallying point. But absent that rallying point there are plenty of others. And we ignore those others at our peril. Plenty of irreligious bigots.
The Bible says nothing about us other than one verse in Deuteronomy about crossdressing (I identify as female so I‚Äôm not really crossdressing when I‚Äôm my real self) that some cling to while ignoring the verses about not eating shrimp, cheeseburgers, or bacon, driving on the Sabbath, etc‚Ä¶because the OT law no longer applies, except you know the stuff against LGBT, Piercings, Tattoos, and anything else that makes certain folks uncomfortable.

Then there‚Äôs the verse that humans were created male and female which at best could be misused against non-binary people but doesn‚Äôt really apply to trans persons who identify as one or the other.

Transphobia is a case of Eisegesis or reading into a text what you want to believe so the text can ‚Äúsupport‚Äù you. It‚Äôs the opposite of Exegesis and a lot of people are guilty of it.
It so disappoints me that sci-fi of that era gave us so many good cautionary tales without guides on how to prevent them \^_\^;
It's really funny to me that these people call themselves the ""silent majority"" because when you do all the math it boils down to them just being the loudest 13% of the population.
We do want to leave here, I want to go to the west cost but we're worried about the cost of living
I suppose that's another use for it.

What a fucking world we live in
As per his literal instructions. 

1. Love thy neighbor 

2. Judge not 

3. Help the needy 

4. Abhor wealth 

I truly do not understand how the faith collapsed into a hateful echo chamber, but alas, here we are.
For sure. They're everywhere.  But it's PREACHED at church.  Even though we are all HUMAN.
We're on the same page.  The BIBLE is fine.  It's ""man's"" interpretation that is being Preached.  And they are wrong.
Do you have any queer friends in better states who could possibly help you organize a move? Who'd let you stay with them for a few weeks while you plan your next steps?
I don't see anything such as ""it's bad to be gay/trans"" in the instructions.

&#x200B;

Do I miss something?
It's also preached by edgy dudes on 4chan who haven't been to church in over a decade if ever though. Church is the building that lets them gather to do it. Rallying points are about raising a flag so those of like minds can flock to it, organize, and recruit others. The OK hand symbol. The swastika. The cross. A series of books about a boy who finds out he's a wizard. They're just rallying points for hatred.

But our flags are rallying points for us.
Yep. 

If they have to acknowledge that their behavior toward us is wrong, they have to acknowledge A LOT of their behavior is wrong. 

For whatever reason they think Jesus was lying about camels having an easier time passing through the eye of a needle than rich people will have getting into their precious kingdom of escapist fantasy.

I am the baddest bitch in this Cracker Barrel bathroom (21mo estrogen) ü•∞		"Cracker Barrel did a whole thing in the 1990s where they fired all their openly queer and ""suspected"" queer employees nationwide.

A bunch of queer folks in different cities protested by simultaneously going to their local restaurant. At the agreed-upon time, they went in as couples, ordered meals, and paid with $100 bills. Eventually, the cashiers ran out of $20 bills to give in change, so they just let the people with $100 bills leave without paying.

Dunno how much it impacted hiring policy, but it may have had an impact on the ""no bills larger than $20"" sign you see on their walls now.
Damn girl, you look amazing!  Beautiful tats!
Don't be overly modest; you're probably the baddest bitch in the *whole* Cracker Barrel.

üòê I use he/him pronouns in school but I don't pass enough to go with the dudes		"lmao no please i used to do this all the time, THEY STAY SO FUCKING LONG THO WHY DO GIRLS HAVE TO HAVE LITERAL FAMILY REUNIONS IN THE BATHROOM
I haven't even had the confidence to use the womans washroom, I am MtF and my work did turn the employee washrooms into gender neutral ones.
I DO THE SAME THING IN THE GUYS BATHROOM. It freakin sucks
daily reminder that transphobia causes men to have to use the women's bathroom
A Cis women could use the mens bathroom and no one would care. Only thing would be the creepers
Refugerestrooms is an app and website that maps safe space bathrooms. It‚Äôs free and you can even add to it. Not sponsored just recommending
I‚Äôm just scared of the men‚Äôs bathroom 

I live in an area that‚Äôs like a gateway between super chill and deadly transphobia so I don‚Äôt know who I can trust and I‚Äôm just too afraid of using the men‚Äôs bathroom because of that
I don‚Äôt pass at all, still used the mens bathroom while wearing sunflower earrings no less
I cut my hair and they thought i was a boy even though i was forced to go to the girls PE
I'm not convinced I'll ever feel like I pass well enough to use the men's bathroom safely. The chances of something going horrifically wrong and me getting murdered or worse  may be slim but that is just not a threat I can face.
me, a trans man who does the exact same thing except in the guy‚Äôs bathroom. sometimes if you can convince an ally to go with you theyll help you out though!
LMAO ok so like when I first started growing my beard, I was in a rural area and needed to pee SO BAD but the men‚Äôs room was absolutely piss covered. So I like hid my face in my shirt and went to the women‚Äôs room. I made it out, but forgot to consider the people who saw me come out of the women‚Äôs room pull my shirt down and reveal the beard lol
Don't forget the other hapf of going in the one you do identify with but then suddenly its not quiet anymore and you also have to wait because you're worried about not passing well enough to be in there
My flowchart: Avoid using public bathrooms > only shop at stores with single stall bathrooms > sneak into bathroom that matches my assigned gender and hide in stall > wet my pants > consider maybe using bathroom that doesn't match my assigned gender.

(Only half serious about the above, but honestly still haven't felt confident enough in my presentation to switch bathrooms, despite being gendered correctly more often lately.)
Just a word of encouragement, one of my besties who's a trans man said what gave him the confidence to use the men's toilets was finding out that sometimes when his completely cis mother is having a good conversation with guy friends, rather than finishing the convo, she instead just goes into the men's loos with them and uses them (and she's never had any trouble for it).
i did this too. the girls that knew i was transmasc were supportive and didn't give me shit for being in there because the boys that went to my highschool were very transphobic
I thought I was the only one (mtf here tho ü§™)
I do this in the men‚Äôs bathroom as a trans man tooüòÇüòÇüòÇ
i feel this. im in the middle zone of passing ish. which would be nice since u wanna be endrogenous. but everyone always tracks me as male ;~;

anyways, i really dont fit in in any bathroom anymore. but i guess thats progress.
Visually nonbinary slowly but not too slowly pushing the door open on the women's bathroom and looking straight down and beelining for the stalls because at least it doesn't smell like urinals... I think I'm getting used to it... If anyone wants to think it's a man coming in to harass them, well..well... it's not. See the beelining for the stalls and hear the pee? Lol.
Shared experience even tho I'm transfem

I'm always really worried I'll get the cops called on me for using the ""wrong"" bathroom.....

Even tho I have my ID changed and i wouldn't get in any real trouble....
same with me but opposite. only once i‚Äôve used the girls bathroom bc my senior friend was like ‚ÄúOh hush cmon ur a girl‚Äù üò≠
[deleted]
I have a binder and a packer, but I'm still perceived as female. I used the men's bathroom once and it was TERRIFYING. Don't get me wrong, absolutely nothing happened, I just freaked MYSELF out going ""oh gosh what if they hear me pee in a stall? I forgot cis men use urinals oh God there's an imposter among us-""
I could get in legal trouble Anytime I go in either bathroom
I am a transfem and I do go to the one for boys because of the same reason
I don't pass either, but my boss introduced me to the entire workplace (80 people) and she was all like: ""This is N, he's our new member of the R&D Department', so the whole company knows I'm a dude even if I don't necessarily pass that well.
Regardless, I only feel comfortable using a specific bathroom, it's basically one that you walk in and there's only one stall. 

Anywho, I can only use the bathrooms at work, outside of it...I don't think I pass well enough to do it, sigh.
Omg this is just incredibly relatable, I‚Äôm MtF, and when a bunch of boys come in and start doing drugs or whatever else there‚Äôs no way I‚Äôm getting out of that thing
I use to have the confidence to use the men‚Äôs bathroom but then one day I walked in there and a bunch of cis dudes gave me a really disgusted look..turned around, walked out and haven‚Äôt been in one since lol :‚Äô)
I do this but in the mens bathroom... and I'm a man üíÄ
hey man weather or not you pass, go in, wtf they gonna do? shoot ya? i think not, theyll sit their clown ass' down and stfu
There's one bathroom in my school that nobody ever goes to so if I go to that one during a class I can survive but I usually just don't drink water in school so I don't have to risk it

i can‚Äôt even do this bc people at my school love to get in a circle and pass around the communal vapes in the bathroom, it's actually hilarious if you frame it like a strange fruit smelling ritual
ONG
Honestly we should remove gendered bathrooms and just make them individual, gender neutral bathrooms.
This
Me coming out of the stall acting like it's a costume saying I lost a bet üò≠
SAME I WAS ALONE THEN SOMEONE WALKED IN AND I PANICKED AND HID THERE
Yup I remember the first day I wore tied back and my nails painted to school I unfortunately had to go to the bathroom and I just had to stay there for like 10 minutes as I waited for all of them to get out. Unfortunately some guys were about to start vaping in there so I just had to leave with them in there. It was very awkward because I also don‚Äôt think they knew I was in there. From that point on I‚Äôve been trying to make sure I never go to a gendered public restroom until I pass.
I would find it really weird if a women used the mens bathroom
Saving this
I've never heard where I live described so accurately
Based
My sunflower earrings do make me pass less I realised, but there's no way in hell I'm not wearing them anymore
or they'll like get store security or something

or just scream or get mad at me.... or even just mutter transphobic shit under their breath

all of that means I avoid public restrooms at all costs
Sounds like a dope friend
I will friend you ong
Some men prefer to sit and pee. Urinals can be messy to use. Some men pee when they sit to take a shit.   Idk if the peeing sounds different though.  They also do that 'courtesy flush', like for smells.....so you don't have to be done to flush and it could mask the sound.... And just because you flush doesn't mean you're done.  And if someone asks after you flush - they probably won't - just mumble 'fart flush' or something.  I hope this helps:  )
I'm asexual aromantic üòê and born female. Ya toast waffle
You'll grow a beard by the time they all get out, perhaps by then you'll pass well enough to use the men's! üòÇ
Man‚Äôs going to die of old age on the toilet
bro istg i‚Äôd be in there for more than an hour sometimes, i‚Äôd whip out my nintendo DS and just game while waiting for them to leave üò≠
did they at least talk about something interesting to you?
lmao they did that at my school too but only in one specific bathroom, so i‚Äôd never go in that bathroom lol
my high school has done that, bathrooms aren't gendered there
Fr tho, there is literally no reason to have gendered bathrooms
While individual bathrooms are useful and should exist, they don‚Äôt need to be all public bathrooms.

Before the pandemic, I was at PAX East. For the weekend most bathrooms in the expo Center hosting it we‚Äôre relabelled gender neutral, and men and women used them.

It was pretty nice, all things considered. Lines evened out between them, and there were no issues. People did what normal people do in public bathrooms - got in and got out without issue.

Just treat them like another man in the bathroom. Ignore them and do your business
If you‚Äôre looking for more resources I cannot recommend Solace enough. It requires a passcode, It has goals and in depth ways to reach them and you can personalize them to yourself. It includes everything from legal advice to news to fashion tips. Again not sponsored but it is helpful.

yeah too bad she graduated üòî
No bro they didn't know I was there
That‚Äôs nice! :D
The only reason I say the individual part is for people who are really self conscious and want a bathroom that they won‚Äôt be judged or uncomfortable in.

I work at a building that has made many of the public restrooms all gender which I think is great for everyone who uses the building. :D
Move to Canada girl I'll go to the bathroom with you üò≠
Of course! Individual bathrooms are an important component to have available!

This just happened. My messages. Please please please give me the strength not to just walk out of work rn		"Sorry about what happened. Some people are just unreasonable. 
Same sort of thing happened when I came out at work around a year ago. 
Good luck with it all, and ignore the transphobes if you can! :)
(This is off topic but it's ""no soy un hombre"", estoy is used for things like emotion rather than identities) I'm sorry this happened to you
I waited out the rest of my shift. My employment is full of catholics who are very judgemental and bigoted about gender issues. Pretty sure they're all gonna spread rumors and unite against me. 
Already getting dirty looks from the women as I walk out.  üò¢
What do genitals have to do with peeing/taking a dump ü§î
This is awful I‚Äôm so sorry you dealt with this. I hope you are okay. Remember to take some deep breaths if you can and to do some self care if possible.

I‚Äôm so sorry your workplace is transphobic and it‚Äôs one of the scariest things to deal with. I know others mentioned reading up on your states laws about discrimination so I hope that will help.

If there is any way any of us can help please let us know.
I‚Äôll never understand the trans bathroom debacle. There has literally never been nor is there currently anything stopping a Cis man from walking into a women‚Äôs restroom. Ever. Never in the history of gendered bathrooms has there ever been anything stopping whatever they‚Äôre all afraid of happening from happening, but now trans people want to use the bathroom that fits their gender all of a sudden now it‚Äôs a problem.
I'm so sorry that happened to you! No one should care who bathroom you use, you're taking a shit not procreating bruh





(By the way, it's ""No soy un hombre"" not ""No estoy un hombre"" cuz ""estar"" is about a state of being, like ""being happy"" (estoy feliz). And ""soy"" is being if one's personality or anything about themselves ""I'm trans"" (Soy trans). For example, just pointing out)
I‚Äôm sorry, I fucking wish people would just leave us and our bodies alone. We should be allowed to use basic public facilities without being harassed
Hey, feel proud of yourself, you're really brave for using the bathroom you need and not caring about others. I could never have that much courage. I'm sorry this is happening to you, stay strong!
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you. üòü‚ù§Ô∏è
People just need to mind their damn 
business and let people be people!! 
Sorry that happened to you   :((
I started a new job after coming out. I spent almost an entire year being the only woman on my side of the building. It still took me a few months to feel comfortable even using the bathroom at work. 

I‚Äôm thankful this new girl that just recently started seems perfectly fine with who I am. We deal with enough stupid at that job anyway.
bathrooms should be divided between peeing and pooping
Honestly that sounds like discrimination, is there someone you can escalate your supervisor's behaviour to?
Please do not walk out you got this sis! Unfortunately, it's our reality but we must stand our ground. I heard this beautiful saying the other day: lather yourself with oil when you step outside, everything will slip off. I know it's hard to do but know there is a legion of sisters out here rooting you on! ‚ù§Ô∏è
To any other native speakers would you say no soy hombre or no soy un hombre here?

¬øY, yo no les digo cuando ellas tambien usan el ba√±o. Porque se estan fijando que ando haciendo en el ba√±o?
üòë
Some people just suck
I'm sorry that this happened to you, but I'm glad that you shared it and that I saw it. I've had a hard 24 hours, and it's comforting to know that I'm not alone. I don't know in what direction society is going, but I have hope that it'll get better, and the workplace will hopefully change for you as well. I'm really sorry that you're going through it, though, and I hope it gets better for you.
Because they think they have the right to what‚Äôs in you‚Äôre pants
Honestly sounds like it's time to find another job if you can. No harm in applying around. Just sounds like there's someone with some deep bigotry afoot.
Is there an HR you could report this to? Most places I‚Äôve worked at is a don‚Äôt ask don‚Äôt tell type of thing? That was very inappropriate of them to do that. I don‚Äôt blame you for not wanting to go back.
Gendered restrooms make no sense if you think about it. Why does anyone care? It‚Äôs just a place to piss and shit.
So ridiculous, I mean you're a woman so you use the woman's restroom. People are so hateful and ignorant.
I'm sorry you had to defend yourself in this matter. Hope you found the energy to go on. 

Off topic: How did you get your WhatsApp (?) that colorful? üòáü§óüòä
I‚Äôm sorry this happened to you is your supervisor also catholic and judgemental or did he not care you are trans?
I wish people would just let us use the bathroom for what the bathroom is meant for. Jesus, it's such a simple thing
1-sorry for your experience im so so so sorry sister üòîüòîüòî society is still unprepared for this.

2-Side note: no *soy* un hombre. Estoy is for temporary stuff (sadness, sickness...)
It's shit like this happening that scares me to keep living stealth. I've just always thought that if they assume I'm cis, they can't discriminate against me for being trans. That and Texas is a scary place. üò∞
Btw ‚Äúno soy un hombre‚Äù
Ya only had one interaction at work like that.

When i came out i individually asked all the women if they were Alright with me using the womens bathroom (there was a uni but on the other side of the building and there was only 5 girls working with me at the time.) All perfectly fine and  supportive.
Then we got a new 5'0 "" girl who freaked out and such. (When i was just starting transitioning). Fun talked with HR, and she later apologized x.x.

Nowadays, none of them care, new or old.

Wish you the best!

I'm sorry that happened to you but please be careful! Depending on where you live there are states making that illegal! In Arkansas they are passing an aggressive anti-trans bathroom bill that charges you with ""sexual indecency with a child"" if you are in a public bathroom or changing room at the same time as anyone under 18 and are using a bathroom that doesn't align with your ""biological sex."" That means if you use the bathroom at Walmart and a 17 year old is washing their hands at the sink, if someone clocked you as transgender you could be charged with a sexual misdemeanor that could make your life a living hell frankly. I'm in the medical field and I work in pediatrics, something like that would literally end my career. It's dangerous out here. Please be safe! There are several other states attempting to pass this kind of bill as well.
That needs to go to HR and EEOC honestly. That would be my advice. As for you, remember that they can always go fuckthemselves. You don't need to make excuses for existing
Wow, had a very similar thing happen with me. Sounds like you are working with archaic people. Sorry you had to endure.üíú
off topic but ‚Äúno estoy un hombre‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean ‚Äúi‚Äôm not a man‚Äù by the way, haha... it doesn‚Äôt mean anything.

the sentence would be ‚Äúno *soy* un hombre.‚Äù ((native spanish speaker here)).
If they didn‚Äôt know you were trans then I would see why they would be questioning. If they did know then that‚Äôs just a jerk move
Go Human Resources and say your being discriminated
I mean, if they thought you were a man and recieved a complaint you went into the womans room then didnt they do the right thing in confronting you? And then when you informed them you werent they just apologised, which seems like the right thing again.
pro tip - use ‚Äúsoy‚Äù instead of ‚Äúestoy‚Äù for the meaning you are trying to convey. 

Estoy - or the form Estar - is used for things that are temporary/can change. Example: Yo estoy triste = I am sad. I will not *always* be sad, so that is why we don‚Äôt say ‚ÄúYo soy triste.‚Äù That would be saying you ARE sad, similar to like pathetic. 

Soy- or the form Ser- is used for things that ARE and forever will be. Example - Yo soy doctor= I am (a) doctor. You‚Äôd use Soy here because careers are pretty permanent and a doctor isn‚Äôt changing their career any time soon. 

So to tie this all in back to the main point, you should always say ‚ÄúNo soy hombre. Soy mujer.‚Äù If you ever say ‚ÄúNo estoy un hombre‚Äù, someone could twist that around and say something like ‚ÄúOh so you just flip it throughout the day for convenience?‚Äù or something like that. 

Sorry for the long text I just wanted to make sure you know
Spoke so a woman who was against trans women in toilets.said because there's no certainly we won't do something she'd rather not risk it. On the of chance that a man was dress as a women to prey of women was scary enough for her to not wanna be in a bathroom with a trans women, which I see her point she agreed with me that it was unfair to trans women but stuck by what she said previously tho.
The reason why is it‚Äôs getting more and more apparent that the trans population is becoming littered with pedo‚Äôs not saying you are, and he most likely isn‚Äôt, but true trans people are having to live like everyone else. The bad ones are being picked out, and the mainstream media is showing the bad ones. It‚Äôs not your fault it‚Äôs the sick people in the world, that decide to go out and fill the world with hate. In conclusion sorry you had to deal with this I can‚Äôt say anymore without some people here taking it the wrong way. So I hope you understand because as well as your work space millions of schools are doing this too. But, then again I stay neutral to all here Because I‚Äôm a Christan. But, believe in your rights good luck
Please do not let ""them"" affect you, and please do not let ""them"" affect you easily?

You are not going to be able to stop ignorant people from saying and doing igmorant things, but if you are going to ultimetly triumph,  you cant them them win the battles.

The battles are not between you and ""them"", out there.. The real battle is always going inside of you. Did they upset you by something they said or did$? If yes, they won. Because that wss their intention.

Imo, people dont really care much sbout what others do. They care about hsving power over other. They want to control others. They wsnt the ability to inflict pain on others. If history has taught us nothing else, its tsught us that.

What was the most ""fun"" part for people during the Salem Witch Hunts, the Romans feeding people to the lions, the Spanish Inquisitions, even the hangings that took place in the 1800's. Didnt people come out and make a day of watching people suffee.

People need an enemy. Someone different than. Someone to hate. Someone to abuse. Someone to bully snd scare.

Evil is a very heady experience. Hate causes an awful lot of stimulating chemicals to run through the body. And once someone gets a tsste of it,  they want more, even if they dont understand why.

I cculd go on and on, but theres no need. Hopefully ive hurt nobody here. That was not my intention.

I could say much more about different things, ancillary to this particular problem, but theres really no need for that either. Theres no need for me to tell you these are ignorant, racist, bigoted times. Read the news. Things that go on all over the world in regards to people who are different than others, shake me to my soul. Mostly for other people. Anf one thing ive not often been, is shaken up. Msybe im just too stupid.

For ehatever its worth, my apologies for bsrging in, especially uninvited. Maybe having been bullied in my life sets of my own series of chemicals.

My best wishes to all. Stsy calm. Stay safe. Stay together. Support esch other.

Regardless of the number of gazelle drinking at the pond, the mountain lion, sometimes mountain lions, pick off their prey, one at at a time. Same with hyenas . Same with jackels. Same with the hunters of old, before wespons came into existance.

Life can be hard enough at times. Plesse dont let it become harder by letting the poisons inside of others get inside of you as well.
What the people going ape shit about trans in the bathroom won‚Äôt tell you is that they‚Äôre going to target and harass/assault you regardless of which toilet you use.  So use the one that feels right.
Well - if they didn‚Äôt know ‚Ä¶ a straight dude doesn‚Äôt really belong in the woman‚Äôs room unless it‚Äôs a shitting your pants situation. They should know better than to come in hot like that - but at least they apologized. Take the W - appreciate that you probably opened their mind a bit - and theyll be less likely to act that way in the future.
They apologized, what more do you want. Next time this wont even be an issue.
Baby steps.
how is that retorical not eceryone in the world has been converted into thinking that what gender u are doesn't matter what bathroom u use to him he is in the right he just hasn't accepted the fact  that the world is changing people minds are changing some people will understand and move on some people will always like how the world has been for them males arw males amd females are females  thats it u cant change everybody but u can give it a shot
If it were a multi person restroom i can kinda understand, but if its a one person then wtf
Im not a man would be no soy un hombre. The verb to be is shit in Spanish
Because he is a fucking bigot! Go to his supervisor or better go to HR!

Serious answer:  Some people were traumatized and have irrational fears.  Others were taught that such-and-such is ""how it's supposed to be,"" and although they never understood why, they never think for themselves either.  And yet still others are either gullible people easily stirred up with fear and hate or plain evil people who enjoy the stirring or its consequences.

Their leaders gave them an excuse to act like assholes, so they do.  Blame the leaders above all.  Bunch of morons have done nothing good for this country in 50 years.
People really don‚Äôt have much to occupy their minds that is of any consequence To become so negatively impacted by who is in what cubicle indicates a culture that is focused fundamentally and unhealthily on poo and wee A perfectly healthy focus when you are 1 to 4yrs of age but suggestive of unresolved social issues much beyond that This does not include fart jokes Who doesn‚Äôt love a good fart joke?‚Ä¶ It reminds me of one of the most bizarre declarations of devoted love in the English language:.. I would crawl bare legged for half a mile over broken glass just to hear that woman piss in a jam jar

whoa what a fucking dimwit. I'm so sorry you had to go through that. you are valid, and he isnt. if he was an enough of a man as he thinks he is, he wouldnt give a fuck about other people's genitals. sending hugs babe ‚ù§Ô∏è
It's stigma, I would not recommend walking out because he could've purely just made an assumption and never knew you were trans. As a bartender, I've learned to sometimes never take things personally unless it's seriously targeted against me. If you develop a mindset like that, you will have tiddies of steel, trust me. It fucking sucks and he's a dick for doing it, but it's always good to have a filter, because you're the god of your own life, people shouldn't be able to push you around so easily, and they will if you let them. Don't give up, sis!
estar is the ephemeral version of the verb. But, then again...
At my last job we had a senior scientist get arrested for planting cell phone cameras in women's bathrooms around town and looking at the pictures from his work desktop. I assume people that don't want ""men"" in the bathroom assume the only reason they would be there is to do malicious crap like that.
No idea why this came up on my notifications, but if I was you I'd give him a smack. Sometimes idiots don't understand!
Yeah report her before we get fully erased
Do I need to bust some catholic kneecaps??
This happened to me too.. I‚Äôm so sorry friend.. I hope you‚Äôre feeling better, I‚Äôm here for you!
How'd did it resolve for you?
Omg youre right üò≠üò≠ I only realized that after but i was so upset I wasnt thinking too hard about that >.<
Thank you üíñ
Ughhhh I‚Äôm so sorry. Hope whoever reported you stubs their little toe on something coldüò§
I‚Äôm so sorry this happened to you. If you can document this as best you can, you may have a case for workplace sexual harassment. That all depends on where you are, but there are lots of organizations that will fight for you if that‚Äôs what you want.
Exactly!! Leave mine out of it
Ask the people who invented the urinal
Soy trans!!
So, ""estoy un hombre"" means more like ""I feel like a man.""

Sounds like what transphobes would say about trans people. That being trans is a feeling and not an identity, sad.
Thank you üíñ it's hard to see how I'm doing the right thing, espececially with dirty looks and terf comments, but the overwhelming support has helped so much.
but what if you need to do both??
There is, i just came to them about a separate issue (someone hit me over the head, and it was an engineering supervisor, so hes in trouble) i think I'll wait for something a little more tangible before i go to HR again
I, as a native speaker cis woman, in that situation would say ""soy mujer"" but between those two options, I'll go with ""No soy hombre""
Looks like were on the way to civil war lol
I'm learning a lot of us trans femmes are ready for a fight though ;)
Right!? Wtf!!??
Over half of my coworkers. Lol. But no, i need this job right now. I'm gonna keep farming promotions though and once i have a couple certifications I'm outta here and on to better things.
Definitely go to HR. I don‚Äôt know where you are but depending on that I‚Äôd say tell them you will be contacting your lawyer because you‚Äôve felt harassed. You‚Äôd be surprised how quickly HR‚Äôs attitude changes when those words are said. This is 100% harassment. I‚Äôve someone were to ever mention anything about Karen‚Äôs genitals it would be a lawyers wet dream if HR didn‚Äôt do anything. Gender doesn‚Äôt matter when it comes to that. At least it shouldn‚Äôt. But they care so much about what‚Äôs in our pants. ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I wouldn‚Äôt feel comfortable with a man being around my kids in a restroom üò¨
I think that‚Äôs Telegram! Not WhatsApp (:
Its telegram! Its in the settings. Very good app for communication
He laughed about it. I really have no idea what his opinion is. I dont feel very trusting of anyone though. This will be the 3rd workplace I'm discriminated against
Thankfully i don't have to deal with that. My area is trans friendly, but this specific town is backwards. I appreciate the kind advice üíñ
> states where they‚Äôre making this illegal 

Lord please do.
But how is confronting someone for their bathroom use the right thing? Even if you think you know their gender.
And they shouldnt just assume I'm a man, i would appreciate the respect that i know what bathroom i should be using. I'm an adult. I'm not confused about which bathrooms are which.

I just want to work, not discuss my gender.
They felt misgendered and are allowed to be upset about it.
I understand having a fear, but putting that fear on people who have done nothing wrong isnt right. Fears need to be faced. Actions need to have consequences.
I agree with youm as far as they are concerned I'm not bothered in the slightest, and I'm singing and dancing my cares away. I know they get way more satisfaction from my pain bc the woman who reported me was smiling and content with herself.

So, alright, I'll mirror that. No reason they should get anything positive from my negative emotions.
Holy shit you're right. Thank you for this perspective!!
she's allowed to be upset. this reads as really invalidating.
Agreed. What they do after matters. People are allowed to question or have concerns, but after they're explained it's their behavior after the fact that matters. Doesn't sound like there was outrage and seems once it was explained the supervisor seemed fine.
Their peace of mind is more important than mine somehow?? I just want to use the bathroom without confrontation. I'm not the one hyper focused on people in the bathroom.
Trans women are more likely to be assaulted than cis women. I feel safer using the women‚Äôs restroom than risking a confrontation with men in the men‚Äôs restroom.
Trans women are more likely to be assaulted than cis women. The comfort of bigots should not come at the expense of other people‚Äôs safety. Please look inward, and do some self reflection, and critical thinking.
Cis womens feelings aren‚Äôt more important than trans persons feelings and safety.
Maybe best to stick to your shoplifting subreddits
I don't want sexual predators in the bathroom either.
Well I sometimes chose to use the unisex toilet if it wasn't occupied, if it was I would go back to work and check again after like 30 minutes or something. Then I was forced to use the men's one day because the womens and unisex were closed for maintenance on our level. I was busting so had to go. 

Was verbally assaulted(Too inappropriate to share here), and then realised that I didn't feel safe in the men's toilets anymore, and after talking with my psych I got the confidence to use the womens bathroom more and more over time. My work colleagues didn't like it, but they couldn't say much about it. 

All in all, it was kinda a scary and very anxious time in my life, but often now I don't even get more than a look anymore, and I definitely do not pass yet. I have been fired from my work recently though, no real reason why, but I can only guess. 

I would also recommend educating yourself on your states/countries laws on discrimination and trans rights/workplace discrimination and work with a friend on confidence building so you can stand up for yourself if it comes to it at work. I know it's hard, but 100% worth the effort. 
<3
Sorry,  but why are using an Spanish phrase if you do not know how to properly use it?
I don't get people like that. When I go the bathroom, I'm not even looking at other people. A celebrity or a Victorian ghost could wash their hands right next to me and I wouldn't notice. Why would you want to make yourself the toilet police?
Cold AND sharp, like a NAIL! Sorry, not sorry!
More like ask whoever made genitals. If you pee in the woods, it's the same thing.
Can cis men not sit down? Poor fellas.
People with vulvas can use urinals just fine with practice.
Yes you are! And such a beautiful one! :D

√Ånimo hermana! :D
Well, ""estoy un hombre"" doesn't really makes sense as a sentence. Like saying ""I'm be men""
Not every pee pee time is a poo poo time, but every poo poo time is a pee pee time
Someone HIT you???? Holy shit that's horrible.
Yeah, I was gonna say ‚Äúno soy hombre‚Äù sounds a lot more natural than ‚Äúno soy un hombre‚Äù but I grew up speaking it, never learned formally. 

Soy mujer is probably the most confident response ig
I was thinking about saying ""soy nobinario,"" but idk how wide spread that is yet. Learned it from the internet not too long ago.
I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that, it can‚Äôt be easy to be around people that actively discriminate against you and are bigoted, Andre around  people who don‚Äôt do anything about said bigotry
Yea ik that and agree. But it's always good to see others views is all, it helped she wasn't an arsehole... Outside of what she said

No but tell me what its about then frfr
Exactly. The right can't tell the difference
Thank you so much. I'm looking forward to time passing and getting more comfortable with it. 
I have access to a nonbinary bathroom but i really don't want to feel trapped in using that one. I often do though when i don't have the emotional strength to risk this happening.
Glad you're at a better place now!

I hope to some day live as a woman.
How the fuck does someone not like someone using the bathroom. ""I just don't like it."" 

I don't like you.
>I would also recommend educating yourself on your states/countries laws on discrimination and trans rights/workplace discrimination and work with a friend on confidence building so you can stand up for yourself if it comes to it at work. I know it's hard, but 100% worth the effort. <3

Some people just convince the people at work they're cis instead if they pass and just be happy being stealth.

Possibly due to gender/trans discrimination. That sucks.
Im bilingual and i know how to use estar vs ser, but its my second language and when i get emotional its hard to speak with accurate grammar.
She says they're Catholics so possibly they're Hispanic Catholics.
Most Native English speakers don't know how to use English grammar sometimes it seems.

Also, I had 3 semesters of High School Spanish and I forgot a lot. I didn't remember immediately the difference between soy and estoy. That was always a hard distinction to make.

When you're learning a language, you can make a lot of mistakes.

She may just be trying her best to learn the language often used in her workplace or used in her workplace alongside English (Idk the context of where she works).
That's how speaking other language that's not your first works.
Why are you writing in English if you don't know that it's ""a Spanish phrase"" not ""an Spanish phrase""? Maybe learning a language is hard, requires making mistakes, and minor errors should be seen as learning opportunities.
True. When people come to my town and dont know how to speak english i get really mad just like you.
Why do Karens Karen + why do transphobes transphobe = someone appointing themself toilet police

Such an important skill üôÑ
This made me laugh. Thank you üòÑ
Yeah
Quite, sadly, in some Spanish speaking countries (Mexico for example) it's made fun of and insulted. So I don't think it's a good idea for you to come out as non binary unless you can talk about yourself in Spanish more confidently, cuz the neutral language in Spanish is quite controversial
I agree a question i always ask is would you feel more comfortable with people who are (look and act like) men being forced into the women's restrooms by law?... it seeme in this argument 70% of people forget transmen exist and are effected by this
The fuck kind of question is that? Are you seriously implying that trans women should use the mens restroom to make cis women comfortable? Or avoid confrontation?
https://williamsinstitute.law.ucla.edu/press/ncvs-trans-press-release/
This seems to be what you are looking for
No it‚Äôs due to the fact that their being murdered and shit all the time. It sucks and it‚Äôs reality.
I‚Äôm personally hoping they are banned. Their stupid, and hateful comments can be a good jumping off point for teaching people about the actual marginalization that trans people face. This can be useful when trans people are trying to educate uninformed people about our struggles. I‚Äôve learned much from other trans people, and it has helped me get a few cis people to be allies.
No they exist because of hatred, and ignorance. It‚Äôs irrational, and harmful bigotry. It‚Äôs exactly the type of hatred that nazis used to justify their treatment of Jewish people. You are no different yourself.
If their so afraid of trans people then they can piss at home

I'm just going to leave this here. You can choose to actually educate yourself on what ""we"" define as gender or you can continue using your highschool biology from 15 years ago to push outdated views.
It's about... men and women.
I understand. Don't let people embarrass or shame you into only using that bathroom either. You are valid, and you deserve to use the bathroom you are most comfortable with. 

Everyone here is behind you, and if you need help again in the future, you can reach out and we'll all be here to help and support you :)
Tbh, that would make it even worse..
See, I am German and I speak and write English fluently since I need it daily for work.

I also speak Spanish a little, but I would not be confident enough in my language to explain something like that in Spanish, so I would not do so.

And in another comment OP even said that she had just heard it somewhere a week before.

A native speaker also commented that some people could also be offended by what she said.
lol what makes you think I am mad?
Spread the labia with your fingers and pull up to make the skin at the end of the urethra act like the end of a ski ramp to arc the pee upwards. Then practice aiming in the shower.
A trans guy living stealth in an unfriendly environment doesn‚Äôt consider not being murdered inconsequential.
It also depends on where you are! I'm from Argentina and have always lived in the same city; over here it's quite common to see non-binary people and even to use the gender neutral version of the language when referring to groups of people in institutional environments. For example, saying ""alumnes"" instead of ""alumnos"". Won't say it isn't controversial, but most people are quite chill with it.
That's good too note, thank you
Yes exactly, this can go in a wrong direction very fast.

I'm baffled, thank you! I'm trying this tonight when I shower. HOW HAVE I NOT THOUGHT OF THIS??? We'll see how this helps with my dysphoria

Wait wait, does the person in the story gets killed for n≈ët peeing standing up?
Yeah, Argentina and Spain are more accepting about it than other Hispanic countries
A trans person using a bathroom doesn‚Äôt make it any less safe
Where people piss and shit isn't a safe space üòí
Then you are a transphobe. Plain and simple.
Its not about validation. It about using the correct restroom. And until restrooms are universally gender neutral, trans women belong in womens restrooms. period.   


I don't live my life worrying about what I'm going to do to trigger anyone's trauma because that could literally be anything.  I'm not responsible for a strangers trauma. Period.
No honestly neo Nazi Richard Spencer has said TERF bioessentialism is a useful pipeline to turn feminists into Nazis. Your jumping in head first. Here‚Äôs an excellent article on the subject.

https://xtramagazine.com/power/far-right-feminist-fascist-220810

You‚Äôre a useful cautionary example if nothing else.
Since it's pretty clear you made a point of joining a trans space specifically to push anti-trans views, I'm not even going to bother arguing this further. No, we do not separate ""man"" and ""woman"" by the damn genitals we have lmao
Just a heads up, if you also had a terf send you a degrading message, don't take it to heart. Hopefully they've been banned by now, and if not just block them and move on. Sending love <3
You are obviously trying to misinterpret my point, aren‚Äôt you?

But let me explain it to you: It is never the best idea to explain something of this complexity in a language one is not familiar with.

Look in another comment, a native speaker said some natives could even be offended by these words.

Not when your trans‚Ä¶ you can‚Äôt just ignore that. A trans women is significantly at higher risk than a cis woman. They are currently one of the most at risk group. Specifically black trans women
Trans people are less likely to commit assault than cis people.

https://www.medscape.com/viewarticle/974980
Cis women are not in damaged for sharing spaces with trans people. They are not victims
Dude person pissing isn‚Äôt making it any less safe. I‚Äôd argue that confronting people about their genitals makes things less safe‚Ä¶ bc it leads to sexual harassment
You're twisting what i said. What I said, was people shouldnt have their safe space be some public space, where people only go to shit or piss in a toilet, they shouldn't deny access to anyone (who should be in there), because they feel unsafe, that's not fair to do. I wouldn't go into a mcdonalds and declare it my safe space and expect everyone to leave or not come in
Ooooh I know I should ignore you because judging from your other comments, you seem terrible

But go on then, what are these cis women's struggles? Don't forget that in your answer you must include something ALL cis women go through that NO trans women do. This is because if you exclude even one cis women or include even one trans woman, they are not ""cis women's struggles"" they are just ""women's struggles""

Oh and don't forget, you can't include anything that even one man (trans or cis), or non-bimary person goes through, otherwise it's ""human struggles""
Thank you. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôve faced so much hostility today. I‚Äôm proud of your strength, and resolve.

Okay. So.... I don't know how to get something across to you.. but... whoever you've been transitioning and making steps around is not helping you grow, but rather convincing you to stay in a box.

They are convincing you that you are not a woman, that you will never be a woman. They are instead convincing you that you are a subsect of male, that you are a ***trans***woman, not a ***woman.***

If you are transwoman you are a woman first, a transwoman second.

You are just like other women, your path was just a little different.

You literally cannot be a terf, you will merely be a little posterchild for them to parade around as 'not like other trans people, this one knows they're a _____.'

Trans, Exclusive, Radical, Feminist.

You are excluded from their 'safe spaces.' You are excluded from their concept of women. You are excluded from ***them.***


I'm choosing to believe momentarily you are not a troll, but a legitimately misguided sister who deserves better than what others have told her she gets.

Travel well, but don't ever let anyone tell you you're worth less and different than other girls.

I used the women‚Äôs bathroom for the first time by myself!	I‚Äôm 14, and not out to most people, let alone anywhere near passing, however today, I was out with one of my transmasc-non binary friends, and we needed the toilet. However, the ones we went to were in this under-used car park, as they recently put in a massive shopping centre with massive car park, therefore no one else was using the toilets. Therefore, we both decided that we would use our gender-affirming toilets, rather than our SAAB. I‚Äôm just really happy, and I know I wouldn‚Äôt have done it without him! (Thanks moth!!)	"That is awesome! Congrats!
For a cis person, not familiar with much of the transgender vocabulary, would you care to enlighten me on what SAAB means? I can only think of the Swedish aircraft manufacturer üòÖ
OMG That‚Äôs amazing. Idk what to call the feeling you get when you do stuff like that but it‚Äôs so euphoric!
YAYAYAY!

Congrats! I did so myself for the first time just yesterday, it really feels like making progress with confidence.
Congrats!! üíñüíñ
Congratulations!! ^_^
Omg go you!
Congratulations!! And to Moth too!! :tips hat:
That's a powerful and reclaiming experience. I'm glad you had it in a safe space. :)
Congratulations to both of you! I wish you luck on your transition :)!
Fuck yeah your friends name is Moth? Iconic
YAY IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU!! it‚Äôs way cleaner, as a transmasc i miss having a clean bathroom but love using the right one lol
Good Job! I used the men‚Äôs room once at school... NEVER AGAIN. It stunk, I was anxious as hell, and there was only 1 (one) stall so if someone came in and needed to take a sh*t, it would be awkward. It is sooo scary, I‚Äôm glad you got the guts to do it. (Also, tell your friend that I love their name!)

-Apollo (he/they/xe)
I remember using the men's bathroom for the first time and it felt like a huge weight lifted off my chest. Im happy for you!!!
Omg congrats!! Im 20 and pass well enough in canada (not great but a lot less TERFS) and I wish I had the courage u do cause im still to scared use the mens bathroom alone üòÖ
My mom always goes to the bathrooms with me to make sure nobody makes a big deal, but my dad... he just forces me to use the men's room
congrats!!! that's so awesome!! :) if there is one thing i miss from per-transition its those clean, clean ladies' rooms
I'm so happy for you.
On any other subreddit the title out of context would be a concerning declaration.  On here, something to be congratulated for! üòä
ahh congrats!! thats so awesome!!! :D
that‚Äôs great! I‚Äôm so glad you were able to do that, good job for working up the courage

Good decision. If you can, do what you feel is better for you. Not for others, for you. This is your life and don't let others ruin it. \^\^
i know a Moth, are you in Virginia by any chance?
Congrarulations! I wish I had this courage when I was 14 :P
CONGRATULATIONS!!!!! I‚Äôm so excited for you!!!!!

MY first time was in Kansas in 1998 or 9....
Lisa Cry was in charge of Ekdhal Dining on KU. She literally CHASED ME out of the bathroom, out of the building, and entirely off campus the first day I used the women‚Äôs. They‚Äôve since entirely razed the building where this happened, and I feel glad.
I feel so happy for you, I currently lack the confidence to do thar my self
I'm good I'll just never use the bathroom üòå
**S**ex **A**signed **A**t **B**irth.
Sex assigned at birth, but I would think of the car manufacturer.
Or people use AGAB. Assigned Gender At Birth.
[deleted]
I haven't seen it used before but I'm pretty sure it would be sex assigned at birth.
As a trans woman who somehow hasn't heard the term either, my guess is Sex Assigned At Birth.
Don't worry I'm trans and didn't know what it meant till now
Sex Assigned At Birth!
It stands for sex assigned at birth
Sex assigned at birth.
Sex assigned at birth.
I believe it means sex assigned at birth.
i think ‚Äúsex assigned at birth‚Äù! 

vroom vroom
from what I know SAAB is ‚Äúsex assigned at birth‚Äù
I first thought of the planes and cars as well
They have acquired Saab grippen multirole aircraft
Gender euphoria is the term
I was scared out my skin that a cis woman would walk in, and call me a pervert, as I‚Äôm nowhere near passing, and the uk is full of TERFS.
Thank you. I wish you luck too.
It really was so much cleaner. Before I went here, I used the men‚Äôs toilet twice, in two more popular spots, and it was disgusting. When I went here, I didn‚Äôt even have to worry about wiping the seat down. On the other hand, my friend was complaining of shit-stains up the wall, and a piss-sodden floor.
So one parent is amazing and the other won't let you use the bathroom you're comfortable with
Honestly, when we both came out, the first thing my friend talked about was the smell, and the stereotype that men peeing faster being obvious, from the piss-laden floor
I know.
I still feel like I‚Äôm faking it, to fit in, especially as it turns out a lot of my friends are not cis, even though I didn‚Äôt know that when my egg started cracking.
Nope.
What‚Äôs disgusting?
What do you mean is ""disgusting""?
I feeleth so joyous f'r thee, i currently want the confidence to doth thar mine own self

That makes sense, thanks so much!
Is there a difference between SAAB and AGAB?
Gotcha, thanks so much!
We should start using this as code for ‚Äúsex assigned at birth.‚Äù
Honestly I was reading it and I was like why are they peeing in their car or taking the car into the toilet with them?!

Edit: early morning, writing shit wrong lol
Whew! Glad I‚Äôm not alone, haha.
Yup, I only used a one person bathroom in a place with not many people, so not nearly as brave as what you did - I hope to be there someday. 

You, girl, are an inspiration! And jeez, only at 14, hurrah!
You're welcome :)! And thanks too.
YEPPP. my first time i used a men‚Äôs restroom i literally was at a loss for words. the floor was sticky and it was hard to walk, absolutely foul 99% of the time
Yep, women's bathrooms are sooooo much cleaner here too. I still wipe down the seat but I've never really had to. No piss on the floor or toilet paper everywhere either. I'm so glad I never have to use a men's room again!
Yup... one makes me feel hopeful and comfortable with letting me be who I know I truly am, and the other thinks I'm a brainwashed idiot because of the internet and TV (his evidence being that I believe in climate change and all the different covid guidelines) despite the fact that learned everything that I tell him in school. One of them helps me find underwear that I actually feel comfortable wearing, the other suggests that I wear boys trunks to the beach simply because he ""cant find a bathing suit that would work"" as if we can't just Google it and find one. One tells me every day that she wishes that she was allowed to just... let me take the hormones, but thats not allowed because of the other parent, who would need to sign a contract for it. He always reminds me that even if I do have the surgeries, I will still have a masculine body. He has me always do masculine work for him, he will say that if somebody complements me that they meant it to somebody else, its terrible. 

I dont know where I can like... go to say this without bugging anybody, but it hurts. For him to not be here for me for like... more than half of my life, and then the other half he barely interacts with me, meaning that he technically has only spent about less than 3 enjoyable years with me, where most of the time he was still talking with his dates one after another and not getting to know me. Not getting to know about how I was depressed (well, he knew I think, but he never seemed to get how bad it was, despite me having to take medicine for it.) I dont understand how somebody who barely even knows me,who has no interest in anything I love, or even respects me as a person has so much control over what I do with my body. I dont think he even noticed how much happier I am simply being alive since I found out who I am..

Sorry I hope this isnt annoying, I just.. I dunno where else to post this but once I think about this, it makes me livid. And guess who I got my anger issues from too?
You feel like you‚Äôre faking being trans to fit in with your friends? If that‚Äôs the case then I wish I was born when you were because that‚Äôs NOT how you‚Äôd try to fit in when I was your age lol. I feel like I‚Äôm faking it sometimes too, but then I remember how good it feels to be true to myself. My recommendation is to do your best not to alter your behavior to cater to others, and express yourself in the way that feels the most honest to you. Whether you fit in or not with your peers won‚Äôt matter in the long run, because we all have to live with ourselves. And the people who truly care about you will want you to be happy. If someone is your friend only if you fit their specific mold, they aren‚Äôt really your friend.
gotcha
To me, they're the same thing, but with different wording.

Thank you. Sad thing is, this was an alternative for using the gender-neutral toilets they had down the road, which seemed to be closed off, despite no sign signifying as such.
It's not annoying, I'm glad you got that out! It's frustrating that someone who doesn't even respect you has that much control over your body. It's such a relief that you have your mum, she sounds very loving.
Ah, that sucks. And sorry your country is not the best place for trans people. I‚Äôm in the U.S. and lucky to live in a liberal state.
It‚Äôs okay. Would be so much better however if you didn‚Äôt have to wait for 4 years to get hormones on the nhs.
That‚Äôs such fuckin bullshit. My doctor was willing to prescribe on the first day, no questions asked, no tests, no therapy, no waiting. Informed consent should be the norm.
I wish we had informed consent. In the uk, for the entire trans youth population, there are only two clinics authorised to administer prescriptions of hormones, one in London and one in Leeds. For adults, it doesn‚Äôt improve much, with only about 5 I think. Therefore horrific wait times, and that‚Äôs before the year of ‚Äúlived experience‚Äù. And this was all before the high court banned the administration of puberty blockers to trans kids. No wonder the s*****e rates are so high among trans people.
I‚Äôm so sorry, that‚Äôs horrible. It‚Äôs transphobic and hateful to have such a system. I hope things get better or you can get out, or whatever you need.

Woah, didn‚Äôt expect to find a comment like this in this sub of all places. 

This is something I do have strong views about, but at this point, I‚Äôm too exhausted to get into an internet argument with a stranger over. 

I‚Äôm not sure if your comment is intended to be some kind of ‚Äúgotcha!‚Äù like it‚Äôs some impeccable logic that explains why minors shouldn‚Äôt transition, but nobody is really impressed with this argument, as it‚Äôs ultimately based on preconceptions of what being trans even is.

I‚Äôm sorry if this sounds condescending, but I‚Äôd rather just direct you to some other things than really engage here. It‚Äôs an argument I‚Äôve had before in other inappropriate places, and while one could say a trans subreddit is a better place to have this discussion, this particular sub is meant to be more of a safe space for the trans community, not a place where we have to justify our existence and defend our rights from people who don‚Äôt really understand what it‚Äôs like.

If you want to hear my thoughts on it, I‚Äôve argued this on Reddit before:

https://www.reddit.com/r/SmashBrosUltimate/comments/mfyeoe/share_anywhere/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf

Yeah, it‚Äôs on a smash bros sub - but to be fair, I wasn‚Äôt the one to start the discussion.

If you want to learn more about the transgender experience, this was a good place for me to get educated:

https://genderdysphoria.fyi

It‚Äôs a bit of a long read, but if you‚Äôre curious about the transgender experience or community, I recommend checking it out; seeing as you are commenting on a trans sub about trans issues, it seems you are.

I appreciate your concern, but trans minors don‚Äôt need your protection from the treatment they want and need. They need your protection from hate speech, transphobia, and discrimination. Protection from people who would support LGBdroptheT (that sub got banned a while ago).

There is a reason the T is there, and always should be. The reason the gay rights crusade even happened, the reason gay men and women have the right to marry in the United States today, and the reason we have the Gay Pride parade is all because of the Stonewall riots and movement in the 70s, first started and led by trans women of color in 1969. Marsha P. Johnson is responsible for leading that movement that led to gay men and women getting the right to marry.

And yet, while homosexuality has largely been accepted, the fight for transgender rights has been a bit slower. 

Many people couldn‚Äôt wrap their heads around the idea of a man loving another man, because they themselves could not relate to those feelings. And we see ourselves fighting the same fight today. In the same way that a gay person does not choose to be gay, a trans person does not choose to be trans. 

You think I wanted to be trans? You think I want to be discriminated against? Why would anyone choose this?

That‚Äôs because it‚Äôs not a choice.

You probably don‚Äôt really care about my 2 cents - I‚Äôm just some random internet identity, a person hiding behind a silly name. In fact, that‚Äôs why I promised myself I wouldn‚Äôt ‚Äúengage‚Äù, because while I like to think I could help someone understand, ultimately I‚Äôm probably accomplishing nothing, and looking like an ass doing it.

So I guess that‚Äôs all I really have to say. If you read this all, I‚Äôm actually really happy already that you were open-minded and cared about my opinion and the subject enough to do so. I respect that, even if we still disagree. 

If you‚Äôre still curious about transgender issues and experiences, feel free to PM me and continue to explore trans subs. I think that exposure is a good thing.

I made a meme :3		"Somehow I suspect that these people would absolutely have a problem with my 6'2 beard and biceps having ass strolling into the ladies room.
Wait til I tell these guys about bottom surgeries
Reminds me of the time my cis male cousin got harassed out the bathroom cause they thought he was trans üßçüèæ
My favorite is when they gender single use bathrooms
Transphobes will hate this meme cause ""language"" and then speak the same way themselves
I freaking love this may I steal?
even though i lean more towards male than female, i use the girls' bathroom since im afab and im pre-everything so im scared of not passing

however one time a girl looked at me very concerned and went ""um you know this is the girls' bathroom right? what are you doing here""

lowkey felt euphoric but it was also kinda funny lol

at this point i feel like we should make all bathrooms gender neutral so we dont have these problems
Looool
Why are these bit chez scoping your genitals?
Am I the only one who finds it kinda creepy they think obsessively over who's in the bathroom with them?

Because I can tell you, wholeheartedly, my AFAB ass never gave a single fuck about the person next to me as I cleaned myself up while on my period or when I was doing a quick change into my clothes if I needed to. Only time I get worried is when I need to poop, but I'm embarrassed in general and don't wanna make someone's life temporarily hell from me pooping lol
People who obsess too much about bathrooms are extremely paranoid and need psychiatric help or therapy.
Power move: shit in the sink
How would they even know what genitals you have unless they were sexually harassing/assaulting you?
People suck. Even pre my coming to terms me knew that. Sure, yes. I'm trans... But even if I wasn't... I mean...

Like, don't be a dick? How does this non-problem affect anyone? People be shitin'. It's tricky enough for us, and its about a lot more than ""feeling"" like you're in the ""right"" bathroom. At a certain point, you clearly are an ""x"" in a ""y"" bathroom and you'd be making a scene. We don't want to do that, we're not assholes (or at least most of us).

It's only a matter of time before I'll probably find myself in the same situation, where I can't even ""fake"" looking male anymore. Trust me, I'll be elated when I get there, but having some made up porcelain doll in the most frilly clothes on Earth in the men's room is probably less than ideal.

Just let me shit in peace in either case.
I never use public bathrooms anyways, so I guess I'm lucky? Idfk :p
In my head I imagine this happens and my pre planned response is to say, ""so what I'm hearing is that you want to see my ding dong.""
I've legit gotten so used to using the women's restroom now that when they were out of order at work today I felt VERY uncomfortable with the idea of using the men's room so I just held it in til' my shift ended.
The amount of times trans people are yelled at for taking a shjt
you poop in public toilets?????
Am I weird for still using the men‚Äôs restroom?
I feel like if a transmasc were to go into the womens washroom they would also get yelled at (vice versa for a transfem in the mens washroom)
I feel bad for socially transitioned men not having trash cans in the stallsüòî
Two of my cousins are both cis males, and they've had people give them weird looks when they use the boy's bathroom all the damn time üòÖ
Wait till we tell the transphobes how many men would suddenly show up in the women's restrooms if they forced trans individuals into their at birth gender areas
bruv I just wanna change my pad üò≠
Wrong bathroom? Is there a separate shitting room or can I go in peace
Now what could possibly give you that idea? üòÇ
They don't want you to use either bathroom. They don't want you to exist.
Now I have an image of you strolling into the ladies room while the women looks terrified staring at you üòÇ
Wait until they find out about airplane bathrooms
wait til they find out about cis men who had their genitalia removed due to extreme injury. wait til they find out about cis women who had their genitalia mutilated. wait til they find out about cis men who have such small dicks they'd say they're not even dicks. wait til they find out about cis women with clits so big they'd think they're small penises. wait til they find out about cis intersex people with genitalia they couldn't label. wait til they find out cis and trans people have all sorts of genitalia and it's never their business what strangers have in their pants. actually, you don't have to wait. they've sworn to themselves they'll never even attempt to understand anything that's outside if their limited perception of the world.
They have these at my college but they're gender-neutral, accessible washrooms. Like... Yeah... That's how a washroom works üòÇ I can get the accessible part though cause they got support bars and a button to open the door but the gender-neutral label? Duh.
Sure! With credit :)

I would‚Ä¶ but I don‚Äôt think it would be right bc I was born a dude.
I'm not even 6ft. I'm 5'6 but I'm a broadly built mexican dude and I have caught people staring at me in the women's room for years even before coming out . I think the main thing that stopped them from saying something is the fact I have d cups and wide latina hips lol. Like I had someone approach me AT WORK . From behind calling me sir very loudly . I smile and turn and they see I have a round face and a big chest and I relaxed my voice to use my natural voice to just act like they said nothing. They left very red in the face cus they accidentally validated a trans man.
Wait until they find out how bathrooms and bathouses used to work
I still use the men's restrooms but I'm recently on E (2 months now!) So I still present pretty masculine. That'll start changing soon I know but in the mean time it makes more sense for me

I got dragged out of the house to a mall to walk around in a dress	"Friend of mine decided to get me to go to the mall and she happened to make me bring a dress along to change into because my parents don't approve of me being trans. For some reason the bathrooms were full for a while so it took us a bit to get around to me changing.
Was a good day, we went to a sports bar and the server called me a lady, got catcalled by some random dudes, tried a Sangrea for the first time. Eventually she dragged me over to her place to give me some clothes she wasn't using... I didn't think I'd be able to do any of this for a while

Edit: someone commented about doing this around POC, I just want to tell you that I'm Indian, brown skinned and I live in trinidad and tobago not the US, please look at my previous posts and you'll see a pic of me... People aren't as bad as you think"	"Sounds like a really great friend! I‚Äôm glad she is there to help you when your parents aren‚Äôt supportive. I‚Äôm sorry about your family‚Ä¶ sending much love and support your way! ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I wish I had friends like thisü•∫üåπüåπ
Sounds like a great day. üëçüèª
When my 17 y/o trans daughter wanted to go shopping, we made it a girls day, so it was her, me and my mom. 
It was so great seeing her try on different dresses and tops, my mom ended up paying for all of her new clothes.
I can‚Äôt imagine otherwise. She is still the same kid, I love her just the same. The only difference is that instead of 2 sons I now have a daughter and a son.
My family has sent me some messages or conveyed them through my parents and every single one of them was positive and full of support.
I just wanted to share a happy story.
It‚Äôs great having friends like that. I hope everything works out for yourself and you can fully live true to yourself. I had some friends that helped me pick out a dress to wear to a dance awhile ago. My parents didn‚Äôt approve but I still snuck it in to wear at the dance (was the most fun I‚Äôve ever had at one). Parents eventually threw it out behind my back sadly
Omg im so jelly girl

Sounds like uve got a great friend :)))
Great friend
What a wonderful day. It feels great to get out and be yourself, doesn‚Äôt it??
Sounds like a great day! To avoid waiting try family restrooms at LGBT friendly stores. By the time you do your makeup it will be different customers.
That is so sweet of her, i remember first time i wore skirts in public, i was so anxious but people didn‚Äôt even recognise I was trans! And i got catcalled that day but somehow i could handle all of it and also made my day not that I wanted attention but just the fact that they saw me as woman.
All i want to say is Risk it!!!! Don‚Äôt hide yourself because at the end of the day nobody‚Äôs thoughts matter what they think about you. Live your life and walk with head up !üíï
She sounds like an amazing friend! A great ally too! So glad you had some gender-confirming moments too!

Not to mention, it sounded like you were killing it in that dress!
Hold on to her. People like this are of great help.
As a butch possibly ftm that title gave me a fucking heart attack I assumed the worst lmao. Glad you have supportive friends sounds like you had a fun day
I thought this was gonna be a ftm horror story but this turned out to be an amazing mtf story! 

That‚Äôs one amazing friend!
Aww, I‚Äôm so happy you got to have the mall girl experience!! üíñüíñüíñ
Sounds amazing .
Having a friend like that, who will push you out of your comfort zone to be more accepting of yourself, is one of the BEST things to have. You know she‚Äôs a real one.

I‚Äôm so happy for you!
Need someone liek her
Not the kind of post I expected after reading the title, but I'm glad it was a good experience!
this made my heart so warm, i‚Äôm so happy you have a friend who‚Äôs so supportive and generous :)
Reddit you bustard, I wanted to read that comment about the Sangrea!!
I am half Guyanese, and the half is Scottish blood so both sides seem to be super bull-headed and ignorant. Sorry to hear you're going through difficulties with family acceptance! Its fortunate you have that friend who accept and encourage you!üëçüèºüíï
Awwww.  Much love sister ü•∞
Is the perfect time be happy and enjoy your day ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
that‚Äôs amazing!!
You have an amazing friend
The catcalling and transphobic parents parts suck, but other than that it sounds like amazing girls night out!!

I wish i could do that stuff again. Used to as a teenager with my ex, they helped me discover that I'm not cis... Hopefully the day comes.
Oh, how cool, I did this same thing for trans friend I met recently as well. Its nice to see that gestures like that really do go a long way.
Going out for the first time as your true self in a dress feels incredible! It‚Äôs a little scary but then you realize most people don‚Äôt care and you just work it!
‚ù§Ô∏è
Now this is epic
Sounds like an amazing friend, hope you had fun
Super Jealous!
you have a great friend.
I‚Äôm so happy for u! Your friend sounds great!
Super happy for you. Glad you had a good day üòÑ
Sounds like such an amazing time, with such a great friend.  Absolutely loved hearing about your day. So hope you can do this again soon.
OMFG! 
I read the title and I was like 'uuuggghhh' family trying to make you accept your assigned gender by making you feel embarrassed in public.
But this post warmed my heart, so happy for you girl <3
Big love 2 your sister 2 :3
The only situation where cat calling is ok üòÇ
Glad you had fun. I wish I had a friend to help with stuff like that.
I read the edit.... wait..... someone tried to imply this post was racially insensitive?

Because your post has less to do with race than any sentence ever spoken.... 


That‚Äôs like making spoons a race thing. 

Makes literally no sense üòÇ 

Cute story, glad you had a good day üôÇ
[removed]
Thanks, my parents are that weird ""you can be gay bit you can't be trans"" kind of people.... I don't know how to get them to accept things
I'm sure you'll find some, just keep looking because you're never alone. Try some sites and apps made for LGBT meetups like Lex or HER. I met this friend on Lex
Ya, there are people who support others, glad y'all are supportive
Fortunately for me no one touches my clothes here except for one pair of short shorts that went missing and no one knows where it went
I hope I can keep her, even invited me over to hang out with her GF and like, I really want to go and cook some food, do nails, and all the other stuff I missed out on because I had to be a guy in school
Ya it does, I felt nervous the entire time cos of not being confident
There aren't those around here, I kinda just have to move around stealthily and hope no one notices
I love the attention but damn does it also make me want to sink into a shell and never be perceived again
I wouldn't say killing it, I just try my best to look cute
I will, she made an invite to hang out with her and her GF some day in the future when we're all free, just to figure out when that'll be
You're the second person to assume the worse, it's kinda fun
Hope you had a laugh once you figured it out and I hope you get to have some fun days too
Dammit you're the 3rd to think that, I intended it to be clickbait but not that kind. I say dragged because I'm lazy and yes, she's great, I really want to do more with her like getting a pair of stilettos and almost breaking my ankles
Was great... also scary
Really was
It's not like a comfort zone issue, I just don't do things ok my own cuz I never know what to do. Having anyone there with me is more of an excuse to get it done... tho so far she's the only one who wants me to go out as me
My clickbait title worked!! First time I did a click bait one
Ya, she hates dresses and the ones she gave me won't fit her, we exact opposite in fashion XD
Neither of us got this easy, I believe in you too, do what you can to live life happy
The catcalling was a good part for me, I'm one of those that enjoy it tho my line is as long as its harmless. Wasn't really a night out, we spent the day from like 10 to 7
It really does, having someone to be with often relaxes the fear you feel because you can rely on the other person
I'm just that somebody who sees this that they're trying to go out we'll get the courage off of reading and all the others on here
Idk, we ain't playing games XD
I has lots, finally got to gave a girls trip with someone and got to wear my dress outside, got catcalled and all that... next on my list of things i want to do would be to go get my hair and nails done and go to a party with some girl friends
I need to get some cash before tho just so I ain't being a moocher. Hope you can share some fun experiences on here too at some point, I'm sure everyone will live to hear about it
Dammit you're the 4th person sho thought that so far, I wanted clickbait but not that kind
I do hope everyone can find one friend like that, it's nice to have help
Ya, I didn't want to have to put it in an edit but reddit removed the comment and I really want to reply to people like that and talk to them, get some perspective from them and see why they think like that
Yeah I'm confused on how someone took it that way too? Like it doesn't have any mentions of it, it's just a story of a trip to the mall
About? Ask questions my dude/dudette
That is such a weird stance to have‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry they are like that. Just keep being you, don‚Äôt let anyone try to stop you from being who you are
Oh I recognise this, my parents think gay/trans is okay but non-binary for example is not possible? 
I'm still figuring out myself where I fit in in all this so when that came up in passing convo it felt really uncomfortable...luckily no one noticed it
That‚Äôs how my mom is too
Play with them and say gay men dress like girls lol
Hopefully enough time will allow them to come around. I have a friend who‚Äôs mom rejected her entirely after coming out and after a couple years they‚Äôre talking again. Parents will always think they know what‚Äôs better but if you‚Äôre actively transitioning (even just socially) and you seem happier to them - they should jump on board with your happiness over their misconceptions. Food for thought, stay strong love. I bet the dress looked killer
My grandfather has that weird stance too. How can you approve of one thing but not the other?
Nearly no one used LEX in Poland

I wish more people would since it looks like a cool idea for app, way more different from other apps
They never messed with my clothes before. My parents are kind of similar in that they‚Äôre okay with me being pansexual but I cannot even think about being trans or non binary
Omg mood 


i feel u boo
Don‚Äôt worry, that gets better with time. Experiences like that can also help build your confidence.

I used to have the same difficulty at the start.
No Target stores with Stabucks? The inhumanity l!
Girl, i get so anxious when especially men approach me even though i know i can pull the cis persona üôä and they wouldn‚Äôt know but yet it just makes me anxious üßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
And from the sounds of it, you were very successful ;)
My friend(s) were the best support. I'm an introvert so she helped me slowly reach out of my shell. She stopped with, helped me work on makeup, and quite literally everything about everything it feels. Don't hesitate to reach out to her because I believe she will help you a lot, like the help I had.
I did get a laugh and my days have been good and sometimes bland.
Hehe! I wish I had a friend like that get me a binder OR some amazing suits since I suspect my parents are transphobic
you‚Äôre siphoning her femininity! /j
Thank you so much ! ü•∞
That would be fun, hope you do that soon.
That's understandable.  I would be happy to chat. My little world gets pretty crazy.
I really wanted to know why they thought like that but reddit deleted their comment so I never got to talk to them T.T
I'm the kind of person who won't meet comments like that with hate unless the person is being malicious, perhaps they've had bad experiences
Always, I spent my entire life pleasing others, now it's about me and what I want
just glad we have a generation coming up that isn't going to be like that. Be the change you want in the world and all that
I'm leaving it as is, I'd don't have the effort to waste on them and they always disregard anything I have to say anyway, I'll get a job and move out eventually
I'd love to think like that but my parents aren't the type to stop, honestly I'd probably keep contact to help with stuff I know is happening that'll be a problem for them later and then cut contact. Even if I'm mad at them they're still my parents but there's only so much I'm willing to deal with and that was crossed when my mother decided to publicise that I'm an atheist specifically to get everyone to make problems for me
Perhaps it's seen as them having to compromise on one thing and then they refuse to give anymore ground or something like that
Wish there was a grinder for lesbians, that's an app someone needs to make
Parents are weird, I really don't know what goes through their mind most of the time to be against their kid trying things
Ya I know, that's why I agreed to do it, I want to be more comfortable with me
It has a Starbucks but I've never gone in and it was across a highway from the mall
For better or for worse, I have the same anxiety for everyone regardless of outward appearance
Me being nervous probably helped because I kept doing the grippy thing on the bottom of my dress
She already gave me some new clothes, a kinda cute but professional looking romper being both of our fans cuz it fits perfect and the way it's designed kinda let's the bra peak out if I don't fasten the top but can cover it if I do fasten the top
She also said she has shoes in my size so at some point I'll get those
When I decided to post stuff it was just whatever I was excited about like when I got my bra I got a good pic and posted it, then this one. Just share whatever gets you excited and people will love it
I know mine are but because I wash my own clothes they don't say anything about the clothes I buy... there are other issues but some things go well
She has plenty XD
That‚Äôs the spirit! Be yourself! Don‚Äôt let other people conform you to their narrow thinking! üòòüíï
Yeah thats the energy lets go you can do it sending vibes and suports all the way
Very true! Better times are coming üôèüèª
Ive been thinking about that for a while. With so many of our generation being openminded and so many coming out the future should get better. Theres also still a lot who are brainwashed by their families and the past generations bigotry and hatred though so its a shame.
So...

they said that about us millennials as well, and unfortunately we produced Lauren Boebert and Tomi Lahren. I'm not saying it's not possible, but it's definitely not a given. We'll have to work for it, and make sure of it.
I get it. I‚Äôm rooting for you tho!!! I get the feeling, my parents never listen to me about anything (especially my own feelings lmao). Good to not waste your energy with that tho
Oh geez‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry. That‚Äôs just ridiculous and unusually cruel
Nope. Not with him. He doesn‚Äôt even use the Bible as an excuse like almost everyone else. Instead he says ‚Äúit‚Äôs hypocrisy.‚Äù
We got thisüíïüíïüò©
Sounds even more adorable! Aww
I'm jealous that you had someone for shoes. I had to shop for mine üò© lol
I just hope everyone learns to be open to opposing views too and taboo topics. I still seem too much complaining and people trying to shout over eachother. Make more understanding even with your ""enemy"" because either of us can be misguided in how we do things
Well ya, hence the part where I said, ""be the change you want to see in the world"" 

It'll always take effort but the point is that as a whole the world is moving towards being more accepting
Hope you get through your stuff too
You get use to it over time, I'll have lots of habits to break once I'm on my own but at the very least I can identify the behaviours I have and why they exist
My parents use the excuse of ""people will judge you and you'll be in danger"" as if they don't already judge my weird ass
Don't worry, if we ever meet eachother we cam be awkward together XD
I bought one pair of pumps on sale, I'm so glad I don't gotta spend on shoes cuz them things are expensive... buying a new wardrobe is also going to be expensive
Good outlook on things, best wishes <3

(CW) My dad has decided and now I will never talk to him again.	" 

I messaged my dad happy birthday trying to be nice and repair our relationship. But he ends up sending me this long string and this small tid bit that I'm about to show.

He said this to me. "" I don‚Äôt love you!!! I don‚Äôt know you!!!! Your a freak‚Äîa man that wants to use bathrooms with little girls!! A pervert beyond compare."" I just broke down crying at work and my makeup was running so I had to wash it off I'm just so tired of all this why is life so hard."	"That's horrible :(
OP, you have millions of people to comfort you here, we are here for you.
We will support you.
If we can help, we will.
I‚Äôm so sorry hon. I think it‚Äôs definitely within your best interest to block his number and try your best to forget about him. Anyone who would outright say ‚ÄúI don‚Äôt love you‚Äù to their own child is heartless. The battle of letting go of people you used to call family is definitely a difficult one. So surround yourself with people who WILL love you and support you, and stay strong sister!
That sucks. I'm so sorry. But at least you made the right decision and chose yourself and your mental health. Hope you can heal from this someday.
I am so sorry. I applaud your attempt. Shows how special and sweet your are. Love and hugs sister!
You deserve much more than your dad

If you need anybody I'm here to talk. ‚ù§
He is not worthy of you being his daughter. You are the most important person in your life and no person in your past is worth a single thought by you since they want to hurt you with their words.
I‚Äôm truly terrified that this is what‚Äôs going to happen when I come out to my dad. Different wording, same end result‚Ä¶
Wow...I'm here if you need to talk. Just remember that you are beautiful, you are valid, and you are loved. _hugs_ ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm sorry, any way I can help
I'm so sorry OP. I know it hurts like hell now, but you're better off without a toxic person like that in your life. I know it's far from the same thing, but there's lots of love to find here. If you ever want to chat, do some gaming, etc. Feel free to drop me a line. <3
This makes my hear hurt hun.  

You are so wonderful and deserve joys daily.  üíú
That's terrible. It's his responsibility to be a better father and to treat you with the respect you deserve.

I'm sorry to hear he said those things to you. That was very cruel, and you deserve better than that.
Take my words with a bit of the skeptic's salt. I'm relatively new to this and to myself...

BUT,

I'm sorry. Your father doesn't deserve to know you. 

Maybe he rejected you -your identity. Some piece of work who doesn't know his own daughter called her a pervert. It sounds like he's the one in need of self-reflection. 

Don't let him make you feel bad. He has his entire life to come around and accept you for who you are, but that's on him and him alone. He isn't your burden to bear, so bear him no mind if he bears you no respect or recognition. Parents are supposed to try to understand their kids, to help them or help themselves to come around to who their kids become. He has failed. He may be a father but he's failed to be a dad. 

You on the other hand are still here. You've failed nothing. You showed yourself to him and you're still you despite that. Just be kind to yourself about it. It takes a lot.
he's just trying to manipulate you in a gaslighty way

he's not worth it

you're beautiful
Forget those people, I get it sounds mean and impossible. But life is not living for those that do not support nor love you. You should have love and support and find those that give that to you and not whatever he's doing that's the opposite.
I'm so sorry to hear that. if you need anyone to talk to I'm here for you. and so if everyone else on this sub. you always have support in other trans people. you aren't alone
I'm so sorry that this happened. I'm sorry to say this, but he's not worth talking to anymore. If you need someone to talk to, we all on Reddit would like to help anyway we can, or talk to a friend who cares and loves you for who you are. No matter what, we all, your friends on Reddit, your irl friends all love you. It's just your father is a jackass, and there might be a way for him to change his way, but if there is, it isn't happening soon. You're a beautiful lady, and you should be the best you that you can accomplish! We all love you, and there's nothing those transphobies can do to get rid of us! We love you, and hop you're doing your best!!
I'm sorry that someone who should be there for their kid wants you to live on their terms. You are absolutely beautiful, and you are worthy of the unconditional love a parent can have for their child. I'm sorry your father only loves on his terms. You are doing right by cutting that toxicity out of your life.
I‚Äôm so sorry :(
Family doesn't mean you share blood honey. I know the feeling of dealing with crazy/unwelcoming family members. Just keep being your true self and don't let anyone try to pull you from the path you've chosen to follow~
holy shit thats terrible
you dont deserve him OP, if someone cant accept their kids they dont deserve to be a parent
stay strong girlie <3
Cut him out!! I know it can be hard to do with family, but when they turn against you it can hurt the most. You don‚Äôt need that hurt in your life. 

You are a gorgeous and amazing woman in every sense of the word.
You deserve to be loved. He is in the wrong. I hope you feel better luv! He didn't deserve you.
As awful as this is, and it really is, this is an opportunity for you to mentally closure. You no longer have any reason to believe this is fixable, and you are free from trying.
One day he will be the one crying and realising what he has lost. 

Beliefe in you and your inner feelings! You're beautiful! <3
Your blood family is accidental, your found family is on purpose. We are here for you and you deserve unconditional love.
I‚Äôm sorry :( that‚Äôs really devastating. Reach out to me if you need ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm so sorry. My dad did the same thing. We're here with you ‚ô•Ô∏è
I‚Äôm so sorry
I am so sorry you had to go through that. Your dad sounds like a hateful man who wouldn‚Äôt be happy with anything HE didn‚Äôt chose for your life. Sometimes even blood has to be cut off for your well being and happiness. He‚Äôs abusive to say the least.
Sorry, that really sucks. You deserve a much better father. I hope you feel better, and I hope you can take comfort in people who accept you.

I am also so confused, why do transphobes make everything creepy and sexualized? Has he considered that, by his logic, he is a man who wants to use the bathroom with little boys? Transphobes are creepy, and your dad's sexualization of minors is creepy.
Oh, fuck...

Rarely I have the urge to punch someone's face so hard. I'm sorry you had to go through all this.

 He doesn't deserve your love, you did all you could and was a genuine good person, it's his (and whoever spreads this bullshit) fault. You will be surrounded by people that love you for who you are in the future üíï Cheers üíï
What a prick. Any father should except their kids no matter what. My son and daughter was gay and I was so proud of him
Parents who can't love their children for being themselves shouldn't be Parents.
Well last time I checked no ‚Äúlittle girl‚Äù had problems with transgender people minding their own business
*short, angry, transfem screaming*
Aweee poor bean. Please be safe!
That person is not a dad.  That‚Äôs a sperm donor, nothing more.  You deserve so much more I‚Äôm your life and cutting out that type of toxic hatred is the first step.  You‚Äôll find people who love you for the person you are, and I sincerely hope you never give another moment‚Äôs pause to that sperm donor.
There‚Äôs literally studies proving transgender people are born with the brain of the gender they resonate with. Your dad is fucking stupid and can‚Äôt even use the correct YOURE. You don‚Äôt deserve to be treated like that. Sometimes friends are stronger than family will ever be.
...God damn it, he's so harsh to you. He don't have the right to say that
MFers need to realise that it's never too late to die alone.
What a horrible and vile creature... You are a nice lady, I'm sure of it. It's his loss to be honest.
We're here for you girl, lots of hugs ü´Ç
I'm sorry this person is such an ignorant asshole. You deserve much much better.
Sounds like you did a very caring thing for your dad. I'm so sorry he doesn't understand. Much love going out to you darlin xxx
Posts like these make me wish I could reach through the internet and punch people. Someone like this doesnt deserve functional reproductive organs.
I am so sorry to hear this. As a CIS man and father there is NOTHING that any of my sons could do that would cause a reaction like this. We should love our children for who they are because they are part of us! Maybe over time he will figure this out.
You aren't a pervert you are just a woman you are entering the right bathroom and he was being wrong doing the wrong thing he's just a transphobic bigot.
I‚Äôm so sorry, sis‚Äîyou deserve better. 

I usually offer r/beebutts at a time like this ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©πüôè‚ú®
Your Dad is wrong and life will teach him but by then it will be too late.
Get rid of this clown. He is not your dad.
It‚Äôs difficult with parents not accepting your transition I can understand your pain if I had came out as Pan when my father would have been alive he‚Äôd probably give a similar reaction thankfully my mom is cool with it. 

But I know many friends whose parents are not ok with their orientation and transitions. 

But it‚Äôll get better trust me you just need to find friends and people who support your decisions in how to live life and be content with it
I‚Äôm sorry OP my father did similar things but there is a light at the end of the tunnel it just takes time. You can do this girl we all love you so much!!!!
We Love You!   We have borne your pain and tears.  We Love You!
Friends are gods way of apologising for family.

You DON'T need a dad. You DO need happiness. 

Go find friends who make you happy.

P. S. You dad's Fucking cunt... No insult intended to you, but every insult to you dad. Send me his pic so I can bitch-slap his ugly mush if I ever see it (joking... Honest)
Stop fighting for people who reject you. You can't win this fight. But you will suffer the emotional consequences.

You will make cuts from friends and family eventually (for a lot of reasons, that's just a part of life) and it is a good thing, because you don't have to deal with things that hurt you and that you cannot (!) change. Ending horrible things is a way to move on. Find a good therapist. It will save your life. In more ways than one.

I'm truly sorry. You don't deserve this. I hope you will realize this and I wish you all the best on your way to get there.
You took a bold step
What matters is you've come out. No more worrying about consequences or him finding out someday. He'll think about it too and you will be fine. We re all in this together. üòò üòò ü§ó
Hey, at least if he never talks to you again, he can never say anything bad again! Just block him because not all parents are good parents
Only parents can say such cruel and hateful things. 

Some monsters seem to have a predilection to eat their offspring.

Stay away from this fucking cannibal. His words are unforgivable. No apology will ever cover the excruciating pain he inflicted on you. 

I am sitting here sobbing. I am soooo sad for you, sweetie!!!

I wish I could give you a bunch of hugs right now...
In my eyes, he isn't your dad. He may be your father, but he isn't a dad. No dad could say that. Only a father who is not a dad can. Fertilising an egg with sperm containing your genetic material makes you a father. Being a dad is different. He is not a dad. He is a terrible human being.
I'm sorry üíî
You have our support hun. I guess your sperm donor chose hate over love. Someday he will regret that decision.
Just wanna say as a 30yr old father I used to be homophobe but over the years and the tides changing and growing up and having kids i just realize I want nothing more for them than to be happy. It would hurt if I found out only because I'd know it'll be a hard journey for them in this judgemental world that i used to contribute to. What I'm trying to say is a good father will change his ways to love his children no matter what. You didn't lose a father, you gained insight that you never truly had one. Let it make you stronger and understand its because of the society that raised him before the changes took place, not because of anything you did.
I‚Äôm here if you ever wanna chat. That is a horrendous thing to say to anyone, let alone your child. Obviously it goes without saying, but none of that is true, and you truly are a woman(: Keep your head held high hun‚ù§Ô∏è
OMG...hugz
Oh the bathroom bullshit again. This isn't about you, this is American politics weaponizing transgender issues and you got caught in the crossfire.

Sorry for your loss.
It's okay. I can't tell you how it is from a trans perspective but ,as someone whose ""lost"" a parent through their views, you have to grieve but move one. Get support from those closest to you and never be discouraged for being your true self ‚ù§
Yeah, some people are fed a steady diet of transphobic bs thinking that we're some mentally deranged sexual predator who want to peep on people in bathrooms.
Get away ASAP, you're worth so much more than your bigot of a dad
If he would ever say something like that then he doesn‚Äôt deserve to have a daughter like you why would he even think like that
Freak = telling your own child ""I don't love you""

In my experience the only way to deal with toxic people is to remove them from your life and only let them back in under your conditions. My dad never gave a shit about me but stayed away so it was easy for me to realize other than being screwed over it had nothing to do with me.
Your reddit family is here for you!! My PMs are always open

Your dad is a monster. 


You're absolutely fine and he's too stupid to know what he's talking about.
Dear dad you just confirmed my suspicions, you are an assh‚Ä¶e! Live your life because at the end you are beautiful you are loved üíï
So sorry to hear that. I eill never understand why people can be so cruel. But it'll get better.
I hope you are feeling better princess ‚ù§Ô∏è
[deleted]
So sorry to hear this
Girl you are better than this you are great and deserve the greatest life 
Don't waste your beautiful smile for toxic people even if it hurts sometimes at the beginning
Your father is a homophobic prick forget about him just remembered love yourself before anything else
Cut the extra weight and fly sis. We are here for you ü´Ç
That sucks. I‚Äôm really sorry. He doesn‚Äôt deserve to love you, you are too good for him. Me and everyone in this sub and so many other people support you.
I have no idea what to say. I can say that that is so fucked up that your own father would say that, especially after you tried to be nice. I can also say that it sucks and that although I haven't experienced major transphobia before my dad and I don't always see eye to eye, so I can understand what you're going through at least a bit.
I wish I could hold you in my arms princess
I agree this is not how you talk to your kid its sad but it happened . Maybe someday he will treat you with kindness and respect. Until then keep being you and leave the past hatred he did to you behind you
-hugs-
Hang in there and I hope it gets better for you not everyone feels the same as your Dad . Good Luck
That's awful! You know what, I'm your dad now! Just sign the adoption papers and you can message me instead of him anytime you need some fatherly guidance/love.
I will find him and then kick his ugly ass butt.
Be stronger sister ... hugz
First of all, *hugs*.

Second of all, DARN! Why do people have to be such arseholes? Especially to their goshdarned kids?

I applaud your attempt, but anyone who tells their child ""I don't love you"" is way beyond reasoning with. Hey, at least he's blunt and honest, so you at least know to cut him out immediately. Still, I hope you are okay, it must be shocking to hear that from your bloody dad of all people.

You are better off without him. Hopefully you have people you can turn to.
Sorry to read this. Family are the ones you need the most for support!
Oh my god, I'm so sorry for you... I don't know your dad but this honestly sounds like he isn't worth the effort. How can someone say such things to their own child??

Also, his argument with the bathroom doesn't make the slightest sense. A cis man who uses the men's bathroom is in there with little boys, too. And, I mean... as long as an adult person doesn't follow children (or other adults) into the bathroom stall, I don't see anything wrong with it. When you're outside, shopping or whatever, you're in one room with little girls or boys, too. Why the hell does it make a difference if that room is a bathroom or not? If someone REALLY is a rapist, I think they don't care about the surroundings that much. In a public bathroom, you can just as much be alone with another person or be surrounded by other people as in many other spaces! I honestly don't get what's the big deal with bathrooms and genders... ugh. (And, of course, you AREN'T even a man!)
I'm so sorry
Your dad is a POS.  NO parent should EVER tell their child that.
What happens to people‚Äôs humanity that they will betray their daughter in such a way.

You deserve so much better - you deserve a family that loves, accepts and celebrates you.

I‚Äôm sorry.
What man baby, you know you‚Äôre a failure of a man when you can‚Äôt even be a supportive father to your trans kid, and make it about yourself instead by projecting your own sick insecurities. You‚Äôre dads a creep, and I hate anyone that wants go out of their way to label someone as a predator because it has nothing to do with other people and everything to do with him and his sick, neurotic, immature hatred. Sorry you‚Äôre a child dad, sorry you could never be man enough to do your job and part as a parent, you waste of space, please die alone  with your bitterness and immaturity asshole. You have one job, loving and supporting your kid, you can‚Äôt control who they become in the end, and it‚Äôs not your decision to make either. You‚Äôre dads a narcissist, and I hope his bday was extra shitty with that text message. Also, I‚Äôm sorry you have deal with an absent dad, it‚Äôs not fun. I can surely empathize, but you‚Äôre strong, you‚Äôll make it out better and stronger in the end. Keep on being resilient, keep on being your beautiful self and don‚Äôt worry about the rest.
do people's morals just disappear enough for a POS father to put down his own daughter like that?

I'm appalled and somewhat disgusted that people would do that

I'm so sorry you had to go through that
Sorry this has happened to you. Mine has spent the last year not calling me any actual name as his ""compromise"" between not using my no longer legal dead name and my actual legal new name.

I know if I pushed him he would come out with something similar to yours.

So currently I just don't see mine and don't ack any message and have changed his name to ""."" in my phone lol ..

Deep down though, it is not funny, and it is just a matter of  time (and me doing some actual contact) until he comes up with one of his world ""pronouncements"" on me .... and then I will be one more child out of his life ..

So big hugs to you .... you totally cannot be resonsible for how parents behave. I am a parent and would never behave like that, no matter what. 

Good for you for trying to reach out as well - again not you fault it got rebuffed.

In a vague attempt to add something happy - it did make me smile when you said your make-up ran - at least you are being true to you !!! And life can ask nothing more of that from you xx
1 thing to do rn... ghost him forever untill he apologises
i‚Äôm your new dad. i‚Äôm adopting you right now. we are going to go get ice cream and go shopping and play video games together, and you will be my fucking amazing daughter and feel fucking loved.
Your dad is an emotionally stunted and ignorant man child. I'm sorry for your loss
Did you respond??? I think I would respond saying how wrong he is and how indoctrinated he's been, and then I would never speak to him again.
If you need a replacement parent, hit me up, I'm always down to talk
Fuck him. Atleast we can be your family now :) and i don't get the little kid part, little kids go into the boys bathroom too but somehow you can only be a pervert in the girls bathroom?
So sad people actually think that trans people are predators :c We're just trying to live our lives in peace. So sorry you had to hear this OP üíî You deserve so much better, I hope one day he understands and supports you
Oh honey. Idk how people can be so cruel. Know that you have support here. As little as it means, it's at least something.
Your dad will regret his words when he finds himself alone and no daughter to love him. Time will show him how wrong he was
Speaking as someone who hasn't had contact with their parents in almost 8 years, it sucks sometimes that you can't have them in your life, but once they're out of your life you can begin healing. I am the best, healthiest, strongest, and happiest I have ever been because I keep good people in my life and have cut out toxic people. If I were your dad, I would be thrilled to have a daughter like you, and I would be proud of you for living as your most authentic self, actually I don't have to be your dad to be glad that you have the strength and courage to be your best self. Sending you hugs.
Fuck him he doesn't deserve to have someone as loving as you are, as they say you can't argue with dumbasses just let them have their way, i understand how it is to have unsupportive parents i would love to have a supportive family but you know not all of us are lucky
I‚Äôm so sorry he is behaving that way. You deserve so much better. His inability to grow as a person and listen to your experience in no way reflects on you. You have outgrown him.
To that end, he‚Äôs the one that‚Äôs tormented. 

Needless to say, but anyone that attempts to tear you down is projecting upon you.
Hang in there.
if i were you i'd go full scorched earth on his ass in response to that disgusting display. Fully ruin his life.
I'm so sorry do you have to go through this he loves you he just doesn't remember please don't be hurt he will remember one day the only answer is unconditional love
I'm so sorry. It's bizarre people believe those things.  And then they'll claim we are sheeple.

I feel your pain.  My dad told me I was confused.  After he spent the majority of my developing years in prison.  I've thought about reaching out to him recently.  

It hurts to realize and give up but you don't need or deserve that.  Sending love üíïüíúüíïüçì
If he's like that it's really for the better.  You need people who will support you and love you for you. :/ I'm seeing this at an interesting time. In a couple hours I'm talking to my therapist about coming out to my dad. I've been thinking all week what will happen when I do. So thank you for sharing. It's helped give me insight on possibilities.
I wish I could reach through this technology and hold you and cry with you.  I was born into an impoverished matriarchal culture with a mother who supported me all the way.  My spouse was born into wealthy patriarchal culture with a very abusive mother.  My mother welcomed my spouse into her family as another daughter whilst my spouse‚Äôs mother only increased her abuse and tried to abuse me as well.  We banished my spouse‚Äôs mother.  

You can‚Äôt reach a closed mind.  You can find a loving family beyond the bonds of biology.  In my culture I‚Äôm considered a holy person because I‚Äôm a trans woman.  My spouse and I are in a lesbian marriage.  Although my mother has left this life, I carry her spirit and share it with my friends and family.

It‚Äôs healthy for you to banish the people who reject you and torment you, and welcome the people who honour you for who you are.  First, give yourself the opportunity to feel the hurt and know that we feel it with you.  Next, honour yourself and the people who support you with their acceptance of you.

Those people may evolve into the family who you truly need.
You can never fully not care about your parents opinion, but you can understand that their bigotry is more important to them than you and that it is more mentally healthy for you to separate from them. My mom made the same decision as your father, and while there have been good times, my mental health won‚Äôt be able to handle her when i start HRT and other feminizing procedures
Jesus, I'm so sorry... That is awful. The community is here for you. *Hug* <3

Makes me wonder what my dad would say. I haven't spoken to him in years.
That's awful how dare he mess up your makeup
Honey, as had as it is, you need to get to a place where you can accept that he has thrown away the right to be in your life THROUGH NO FAULT OF YOURS and let him go. He sounds like a very sick man, but it isn't your responsibility to make him well. Take care of yourself, and your heart. That needs to be the focus.

*Hugs*
It‚Äôs hard, but you made the right decision cutting him out, parent or no you don‚Äôt need heartless bigots in your life
This must hurt very bad...You were so kind and you shouldn't regret that. life is hard sometimes and I can't anwser why, but you sure have my biggest hug and support sisterüå∏
[deleted]
How about you make your dad meet my baseball bat?
[removed]
My biggest fear. Sorry to hear that but mabe he'll realize he's wrong someday.
I wish I could give you a big physical hug. I am so sorry.  You are valid.  Certainly not a freak.
That really sucks. Hopefully you have a strong friend network to lean on. I would still suggest going to a counselor.
üñ§‚ô•Ô∏è *hug* I'm so sorry
Yikes what a POS. Should‚Äôve never had a child if he wouldn‚Äôt love them unconditionally. 

Well you‚Äôre better off without him.
Im so sorry honey, I wish I didn't understand and that this never happened to you. I am here for you if you need to dm
I‚Äôm so sorry. He‚Äôs not worth the time of day and that‚Äôs not your fault at all. I wish I was with you in person so I could hold you. But I‚Äôll still tell you: 

It will all be okay. People reveal who they are in unexpected circumstances. Your sperm donor revealed himself to be a monster. He‚Äôs missing out on getting to know the real you. As for you, it‚Äôs better that you don‚Äôt have him in your life because that is not someone worth keeping in it.
I‚Äôm so sorry. You don‚Äôt deserve that. I hope you find your true family sooner than later.
O hun sending hugs ü´Ç
baby I'm so sorry <3
I am so sorry this happened to you. At least you were doing your part tho. You were the good daughter by wishing him happy birthday you met him half way. If he didn‚Äôt show up and do his part that‚Äôs on him. You are no freak and only time will prove to him his way of thinking is wrong. Big hugs and I hope you continue to shine and sparkle. Xoxo
I know it‚Äôs unlikely that we can make you feel any better but that sound like they are lashing out because they don‚Äôt understand. We‚Äôre all afraid of what we don‚Äôt understand. But obviously that‚Äôs not why you are doing any of this. Don‚Äôt let their confusion and pain dictate everything. Be strong sister!
I feel you‚Ä¶ You‚Äôre not alone on this though. 
I‚Äôve decided to cut ties with my dad just this Sunday. 

He came to my church between services (which I still actively volunteer as drummer and lighting director. The pastor also knows I‚Äôm in transition and still openly welcomes me to serving.) just to tell me how much he disproves of me ‚Äútrying to be a woman‚Äù. And kept referring to me as (I kid you not he used emphasis on this‚Ä¶.) a MAN. a HANDSOME man. Then quickly switched  into how would this screw up my kids? About how they‚Äôd be bullied because their *father* thinks they‚Äôre a girl?‚Ä¶ 

I‚Äôve never cried on stage before. Until this past Sunday. 

I‚Äôm sorry our dads are dicks‚Ä¶. Yours seems so much worse though FUCK him. 

* apologizes in prayer for swearing ü§£
Sometimes it's best to leave toxic, non supporting people in the dust in order for us to shine our brightest. Keep your head up girl ‚ù§
I‚Äôm sorry that your dad sucks üò¢
Had to give this a wholesome reward
What the actual fuck! That's horrid, he was never good enough to be your father anyways, you're so much better than him and if he wants to act like a child then let him, you deserve so much better than that pos.
As a parent I could not imagine saying this to my child, it's so cold
I‚Äôm so sorry. Hard day indeed. After you tried to be kind. I wish you well. üôè
My uncle doesn't talk too me because I'm pan sending much hugs and love :'(
That‚Äôs horrible! But he‚Äôs not a dad if that‚Äôs how he feels he was just a sperm donor‚Ä¶

My not a dad was a dad when I was a boy but at 33-34 when I transitioned he called me disgusting, I replied ‚Äúthat‚Äôs not what the men say when they‚Äôre screwing me!‚Äù  I think I broke him back! I got the last laugh and cried‚Ä¶
Just because he's your father doesn't automatically qualify him for your respect. That has to be earned.

I'm not saying it doesn't hurt like hell to be rejected. It does. 

But you will find people who respect you for who you are, not who they want you to be.
I am so sorry, I‚Äôm not trans so I can‚Äôt even imagine how difficult this is, but if my dad ever said anything like that to me it would break me. *sends virtual hug*
Have a Great Sunday

Hey, you're showing your thing in front of little kids, don't you think it's not normal and something no one should do? Stop finding reasons for your sickness to be accepted.
No matter what He says He still loves you He will put this behind Him .. Hope Soon Have a Great Day

I‚Äòm sorry but your dad is absolutely right, you should seek mental help.
I‚Äòm sorry but your dad is absolutely right, you should seek mental help.
Does your mom know he said this?
Im so sorry. If it means anything my dad's a piece of shit that I assume would respond in the same way. I don't know though because he's a piece of shit and doesn't talk to any of his kids lol. You know what? It's better this way. At least it is for me. The thing with being trans is you get to see who the good people around you are.
fuck me that's horrible... what a fucking dick, such a shitty thing to say to your own kid. im so So sorry that this happened, just know that we are here for you. your father might not support you but i know this community will. its going to be ok, best thing to do is just cut ties with him. people like that unfortunately seem to never change there tune. üòî 

sending good vibes and much love your way üíó
If that's what he thinks, then he's right in that he has no idea who you, his own child, are. The rest of what he said shows his character, that he loves and values his daily hate porn more than his child(ren). For that reason, he's not someone that should be trusted around children. 

You stay strong. NC isn't easy, but know that you've done the right thing. No one will fault you for escaping such a gormless, hateful beast of a human.
What an asshole, dont listen to him he doesnt have a clue what hes on about and is clearly a scared sewer rat
No offence but your dad sounds like a total idiot lol
Don‚Äôt listen to him he‚Äôs just stupid

üôÅüòìü§¨
that is a truly horrific thing for a parent to say to their child, i'm so sorry
2 words: his loss.
my number one fear, that's so awful. I wish you the best of luck dealing with your situation. remember that there's nothing wrong with you :)
So sorry to hear that. Hugs ‚ù£Ô∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
you have family here now.
I‚Äôm sorry that man is a hateful loser and makes no attempt to hide it.

As a dad to a trans child, I can‚Äôt imagine how somebody could fail so colossally at the easiest part of being a parent, which is to love your child unconditionally.

If you ever want dadly advice, my inbox is open.

Sis, you're definitely not alone. 

We got ya girl! 

Much Love!üíúüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
In my experience, Chosen Family is better than blood family.  Chosen Family has deliberately made a decision to be with me, while blood relatives are just there by default.   


\*>>HUGS<<\*
Yeah fuck that dude tbh. I can't imagine losing your dad like that but I have a brother my entire family has cut off because he was ""red pilled"" and it sucks. We miss him but we mostly miss who he was before his mind was corrupted.
killing a person that never existed is extremely absurd
You will live long whilst he mourns by the side of an empty grave of his own creation.
Yeah, the family you make will always be better. I‚Äôve had to cut off my family before, but this one will hurt because for the first time in my life we have a decent relationship.
well then heres another (>‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢)>
Most of the multi-player ones have kinda been languishing because I've been hitting Cyberpunk 2077 pretty hard. That said, when I do take a break from that it's Lost Ark, New World, Warzone (COD is a guilty pleasure), or Civ 6, though I'm never opposed to checking out new ones or returning to a few classics. :)
Good! Sounds like you know what's up :)
Thank you. I try to be. But I will except anyone whose parents dont like them as my children
He's wrong, you're not a ""perverted freak"" or what the hell he said, you're a good person
He‚Äôs going to waste away his life on hating then regret it
That‚Äôs a very healthy thing to do
‚ô•Ô∏è
Oh fuck ya
No problemo, hopefully one day he'll reach out and apologize to you, and accept you as his daughter, but until then, we're here for you
I'm in my early 40's and my dad has the same level of understanding about stuff. Wish I could say it gets better but all I can say is heaven and hell are at your elbow and the choice is yours.
That‚Äôs a great way to look at it!

Family of choice is the strongest family their is! I hope you‚Äôve found yours, or will soon find it!

 ü´Çü´Çü´Ç yes definitely his loss.
My in laws are the same way. I‚Äôve been back and forth through that Bible (I am a Christian) and there‚Äôs not much, if anything, on this. People don‚Äôt like Sigma‚Äôs because they don‚Äôt make sense.

Anyone who lives outside the normal structures. Be the true you!
I‚Äôve been with this specific church for about 20+ years now that I think about it. I started as a drummer since I was 6 and kinda grew with them as they got bigger, then smaller. Then slightly bigger.. we call this place the worlds smallest mega-church üòÇ. But yeah the pastor has an understanding for the LGBTQ community and sees absolutely no reason why that should stop anyone from serving in the ministry. But hugs back to you sis ‚ù§Ô∏è
Np, don't worry, we all love you so much more than he ever will
Just keep putting positivity out in the world. ‚úåÔ∏è and your welcome. We all got to stick together

You're welcome :3

Oops
ü§£ü§£ whats that now?
Unfortunately, people have twisted it to mean the exact opposite by just saying ‚Äúblood is thicker than water‚Äù
Thanks it isnt weird
Yea they do ‚ò∫Ô∏è
You. You‚Äôre the transphobe
Yeah, super disappointing that people use that phrase that way. It‚Äôs so dumb.
Thanks, and don't forget.... Do ya thang
Nope, i don‚Äòt have any issues with my gender.
I didn‚Äôt say you have issues with your gender, I said your a transphobe
Please read again, you are saying i‚Äòm a ‚Äûtransphobe‚Äú so you are implying i have doubts about my gender. You have severe issues man, get checked! Also some kind of attention deficit disorder i can see.
Someone doesn‚Äôt know the difference between transgender and transphobe
Wow this is really crazy, but well it‚Äòs Reddit. Lots of crazy people here, hahaha. Next day i may find people who are not sure if they are dogs or trees ü§™
Still don‚Äôt understand the difference between trans and transphobe
I think you have adhd
And you still don‚Äôt know the difference between transgender and transphobe
Mate, they aren‚Äôt saying you are confused about your gender. What they‚Äôre saying is that you‚Äôre transphobic. What that means is that you disapprove of transgender people. It doesn‚Äôt mean you want to be one. We can all clearly see that by how you‚Äôre acting."	tjqyb0	trans	2111	0.98	2022-03-22 00:58:13
What‚Äôs a good response to ‚Äúam i in the right bathroom?‚Äù	"I am honestly so tired of hearing this by cishet men everywhere i go. Even had a security guard purposefully look at my while i was going to use the restroom and when I tried to go in to the mens he called after me and told me that the ladies were on the other side. 

What bothers me more is that i never have a response so please give me your funny, tried (or not) responses because might as well have some fun with the transphobes."	"My motto is to react how a cis person would. Y‚Äôknow how they give people weird looks if they get misgendered? Yeah do that.
""no"" is funniest to me tbh, bc theyll walk out, see the sign and get confused again
I‚Äôm in that uncanny valley area of transitioning at present where people are generally confused when they first see me, especially if I‚Äôm wearing a mask. I‚Äôm mtf but I still use the men‚Äôs for now and I love when I get the ‚Äúlooks‚Äù at the urinal. I generally just lock them in a stare.
‚ÄúDoes the sign say [preferred gender]?‚Äù 

‚ÄúYes?‚Äù 

‚ÄúThen yes, I‚Äôm in the right one.‚Äù
‚ÄúI dunno, are you?‚Äù I mean, just cause they look like a cis man, I don‚Äôt wanna assume!! /s
""That's something you're going to have to figure out for yourself. *I'm* in the right bathroom.""
""Yup, there's the toilet"" üöΩ!
""Dunno, can't you read signs?""
I would just reply ""uh... Which one do you want to be in?"" Because really, who are you to know which bathroom they're supposed to use?
guy looked at me and went ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in the wrong bathroom,‚Äù and I just went ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not, I promise!‚Äù and proceeded to explode in the toilet lmao.
it has never happen to me before but i‚Äôd just say yeah and continue with whatever im doing
It hasn't happened to me yet but I like either ""you know there's a sign on the door before you come in, right?"" or just making eye contact and gesturing wordlessly at the urinals.
I say ""what?"" in my cis man voice. It works.
Just answer all their questions with more questions. Preferably stupid questions.
‚ÄúI am, which means either you‚Äôre not or one of us is very confused.‚Äù
One time a guy was like 'you do know this is the gents, right?' and after panicking for half a second, i just went 'yeah?' and continued to the stall lmao 
(Two of the guys at the urinals were then like 'i guess you never know nowadays huh?' while I had a very quiet freak out in the stall)
coming from someone who is honestly terrified to go to the bathroom in public for these reasons, my brother (also trans and passes 10x better than i do) just stares them in the eyes with a dead look on his face. like absolute dead eyes, like that ‚Äúbitch i am dead inside fuck off‚Äù look and usually they just look at him and look away. he has mastered that dead eyes look i swear. 

personally, if i have to use the bathroom in public it‚Äôs bc i‚Äôm gonna shit my pants. i typically avoid bathrooms at all cost, which can sometimes lead to me being out all day and having peed once so it‚Äôs a race to get home before i piss myself. 

however more recently i have decide to just not go into public. i was at ross and my fianc√© (cis f) went to the bathroom and i kept walking around, but we had just eaten and i was getting this bad bubble guts. eventually i couldn‚Äôt even attempt to hold it anymore and was about to shit myself. someone walked in and asked me if i was in there.. obviously i was they just saw me walk in. and then afterwards i walked out and mid conversation these woman (employees of ross) stopped talking and stared at me. now i‚Äôm talking mid sentence just stopped. and stared. and obviously i have ears and eyes and saw the whole thing happen. 

there could be only two reason i could think of they were staring one being my hair ((which is straight up dyed like a skunk) i smoke a lot of weed) or that i walked out of the womens bathroom.. 

i don‚Äôt pass well because i have a large chest and i am slowly saving the money to have surgery, but like damn. mid conversation just to stare at me and wonder if i was a boy or girl. asshats.
""Yes.""
‚ÄúQuit trying to look at my dick bro‚Äù
No be careful with this one though men can get weird/scary when they get scared they might be doing something gay
Why the fuck you care so much? Gonna watch. 

Immediately shuts anyone up, added bonus if you see them again just call them a pervert. Shame is a wonderful tool
""I'm just here tryin to find the glory hole""
Don't know, are u?
‚ÄúY‚Äôknow, if you face the right way this is actually the LEFT bathroom, not the right.‚Äù
‚ÄúIt has a toilet, doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äù
If someone say: ""are you in the right bathroom""

I'll say: ""I'm intersex, both bathrooms are the right bathrooms"" then look at how much they are confused
""Then why aren't you in there too?"" 

""I'm a guy.""

""So am I Gerald.""

End scene.
I'm sorry I don't know you well enough to answer whether this is the right bathroom for you? I'm trying to pee.
1. Am I blind? No, no I'm not.

2. Why, are you planning on checking?

3. *Looks back and forth between two random guys, and just goes,* ""Oh, woopsie. You guys have fun."" *Winks at them*
I say ""are you?"" ""Mind your own business""  that kind of thing, turn it around back on their rude nosy asses
‚ÄúWell are you a man? If so, you‚Äôre right! If not, the woman‚Äôs restroom is right over there‚Äù

Pick up your phone ‚Äú911, this random man is harassing me when I just need to take a fat shit‚Äù

‚ÄúOh shit did I walk into the woman‚Äôs? Sorry ma‚Äôam‚Äù (this one pisses them off)

‚ÄúI can‚Äôt read.‚Äù

Look at the urinals ‚Äúmaybe not, these are for dudes with small cocks‚Äù

‚ÄúI thought this was the krusty krab‚Äù

‚ÄúThis is a bathroom? Damnit I‚Äôm lost‚Äù
""Are there toilets? Then yes.""
""Hi.""

Works every time. (For me at least.)
‚Äúleave me alone or i piss in your pockets‚Äù
I'm MTF and use women's bathrooms. I'm yet to encounter a bad situation but get a few looks some times.

I had this one very good encounter though. Was cleaning my hands and a woman came out of a stall with her kid that said to her mother ""Mommy, do you know her?""  
That made my day. If kids see me as the right gender, there's still hope for humanity.
Mine would be, Looking down into my trousers. And be like, pretty sure I am not.
But hey, I am kinda no impressed by those peeps
Just tell them in plain english ‚ÄúSorry. I‚Äôd love to help you but I don‚Äôt speak a word of English.‚Äù and go about your business.
""Do ya say that to all guys that pass through here? A little creepy."" For the security guard.


And ""I dunno. Read the door and decide for yourself"" for the ""am I in the right bathroom?"" Comment.
""yes"".
I was told 'the ladies is over there' and I just looked at them, went 'ok' and walked into the men's
‚ÄúThanks for pointing me in the right direction, you know last time I checked there wasn‚Äôt a restroom for bitches like you, maybe try the gender neutral bathroom?‚Äù
Raise one eyebrow and give the person a wireded out look - for being the wiredo they are at this point. Then just be confident about you being in the right bathroom. If they percist, mix in a little annoyance, some ""b*ch please"" if you will. Alternatively you can alter between questioning them back and the first on - depending on your mood. ;-)
It sucks that people can't just use whatever bathroom they want. I mean honestly I wouldn't bat an eye if someone who looks like a male walked into the girls bathroom while I was washing my hands or whatever I mean use whatever bathroom you want it's a bathroom. I like the idea of locking eyes with somebody looking like a hot woman and pulling out a dick bigger than theirs LMAO. Just imagine hot girl walk into the men's bathroom stand up at a urinal next to some guy and pulls out a dick bigger than theirs as they're just staring at them dumbfounded LMAO I think that's the ultimate power move
Does a bear shit in the woods?
I like repeating the question back to them. 
Are you in the right restroom?
Are you in the right bathroom? Say it with a raised eyebrow
""I don't know, are you?"", Then give them a mildly exasperated/confused look and ignore them
*""Yeah, this bathroom is a lot cleaner than the one in the Subway across the street!""*
""No I'm not. This is a dream. Wake up, it's time for your first day of 7th grade""
wear packer, flash bulge, I guess. whenever this happened to me it was in genuine good faith and after confirming both of us just moved on
If you‚Äôre in Canada, you have the legal right to use whatever bathroom you want. If a security guard refuse you to enter, you can do a complaint/sue them (and win). You are protected by the Chart for that, so, if the security guard call you, telling you the women restroom are in the right, you can answer : ‚Äúand the men on the left‚Äù and go in. If they stop you, if you want to, ask the procedure for a complaint (for discrimination based on gender identity)
As a cis male I don‚Äôt get the issue. It‚Äôs a toilet. We all poop and pee. Feel free to use which ever bathroom you desire imo
i have thought about hanging a big trans flag on my backpack like a cape and wearing it to a public mens restroom and if they have to say anything about it, im just be like ""talk to the flag honey""
[say no](https://static.wikia.nocookie.net/itsalwayssunny/images/f/f2/Oyp1s6x7mpk6xemsgmln.jpg/revision/latest/scale-to-width-down/250?cb=20190730075921)

This: üñï


Would be my response so I wouldn't ask me if I were you and you were wanting to be polite.
‚ÄúYes, yes you are‚Äù
""How would I know?""
just look at them disgusted and ignore them. when people confront me about my gender I just say I was born with a hormone disorder that made me this way.
Not trans, but had to deal with a mobility issue for a few months at my old job, and before that at uni.

""Yes"" and ""I certainly hope so"" worked.

""What are you doing here?"" occasionally got thrown around and answered with ""Using the restroom.""

""This is the men's!""
""I know.""

Just state the bleeding obvious as if you're worried about how confused they are at the sight of someone confident to be using indoor plumbing. Do not invite further conversation or discussion by throwing in a question. Make it sound like you are about to ask if they need you to fetch them a grown-up.
My drivers license says female.
""I know I have baby face jees man""
Tell them you never learned to read ?
‚ÄúI‚Äôm good‚Äù
Look at him and slowly back into the bathroom. Don't break eye contact until the door is closed. Or, just start crab walking and sing the national anthem until you get inside the bathroom.
""yes, this is the pee&poo room, if you're doing any of those two you've come to the right place""
It‚Äôs so fucked because if I try to use the ladies room (let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm not feeling brave or like being verbally accosted and/or the mens is occupied) they look at me like I have 2 heads and say the same thing. Unisex bathrooms are honestly my favorite like we are all here to do our thing ya know why make it so weird. 

I usually just give people an extremely dirty scathing look if they make a comment about being in the wrong bathroom. It often succeeds in making people feel uncomfortable enough to back off.
If he asks if he's in the wrong bathroom, you could go ""Oh, this is the men's, do you need me to point you to the women's room?""
""Not my problem bro.""
~~Go as deep as you can without sounding weird and say, ""I know which way I'm going, *ma'am.* that's the passive aggressive way.~~
 The best way I think is just to say, ""I'm good using this one,"" and then stare at them with an awkward smile until they back up.
I never got the opportunity to use it but if someone in the restroom told me: ""This is the ladies room!"" I'd say: ""Thank god, when I saw you I thought I was in the mens room.""

This is a trans fem version but I'm sure you could twist it in a way to make it sound emasculating to cis men.

Edit: for example ""You know this is the mens room, right?""

""Thank god, when I saw you I thought I was in the ladies room!""

Also beware who you say this to, some cis guys might get aggressive if you question their masculinity.
Just act super offended. ""My grandfather didn't die for this country just for to think I'm a woman, I am obviously a man. Just because my face is a bit feminine doesn't mean I'm a woman"" if you are stealthing. That's what some cis men would do. Bonus points if you have a country accent.<<<If you are willing to cause a scene. Or you could also say something like ""sorry but I don't think women would appreciate a man in the bathroom with them"".or just give them a weird out look and go in the bathroom
""good question"" then go imto a stalll
If this means what I think it means... just tell them ""Of course, pieces of shit belong in EVERY bathroom""
""What? Are there not toilets in this one?""
""No, but I lost the key to the executive restroom so this will have to do""
For trans female: My body is more woman than you shut the fuck up

For trans men: I have more testosterone in me than you‚Äôll ever be able to get out of that tiny little dick 

Of course these are for if you choose emotional violence
Honestly just say yes and carry on doing what your doing. Who's business is it some people ffs
Just say ‚Äúyea‚Äù and end the conversation right there, like it never happened.
Im mtf and ive been in the womens restroom once while i was presenting. But it was with my mom and no one seemed to notice so idk.
I use whichever of the bathrooms is available at this point.

Something about being in the middle of non-binary means I don't get stopped or talked to.

Hope you all find your equivalent solace.
response: ""I'm going for a shit. Which is ironic, because when it comes to which toilet I use... I don't give a shit. So, unless you'd like me to just leave a deposit on your floor... I'm going in!""

edit: or just say ""yeah. I know which bathroom to use. So, unless you've seen what's between my legs... keep your assumptions to yourself.""
The ladies is over here? Good for them *enters anyways*
I like ""I don't know, thought that was your job to figure out"" or something like it.
*Nearly Crying*Sorry I'm trans I'm just trying my best to not disturb anyone


That way if they do end up being mean they're more than likely to get kicked out of the establishment
Make direct eye contact and say ""no the womans bathroom is across the hall"" and continue what you where doing
Fake moustache.
never been in this situation but if i was i imagine something like this 

‚Äúyou asking me or asking you?‚Äù
/asking you
‚Äúwelp. ik i made the right choice, can you say the same?‚Äù
""I don't know, are you?""
You should know before you walk in one.
""That's between you and your god.""
This might be more of an American turn of phrase ‚ÄúDoes a bear shit in the woods?‚Äù

Basically don‚Äôt be afraid to be condescending.
I‚Äôm not sure why anyone cares where or how anyone else pees.
i dont know. are you
Give them the old Uno reverse card
An old partner of mine would, as they were being drug out, scream: ""it's cause mine is bigger, huh!""
""This is the men's room, if that's what you're asking.  Excuse me - I have bathroom business to attend to.""
* Just silently glance at the urinals and back. Like holy shit, there are other context clues for these people.
* ""Guess.""
* ""There are no baths in this room, I already checked.""
* ""This is a bathroom!?""
* ""Only if you're a man.""
* Literally anything low, ominous, and unrelated. Like ""Ravens are harbingers of death; mind yourself around them, for the are both perceptive and cunning."" Or ""The universe exists on a scale beyond human comprehension and so, too, do the creatures its dark depths hide from you.""
""Yes""
this week at school, some teacher opened the door to my study room and asked ""Are you [irrevocably male name]?"" She wouldn't have even asked if I actually looked right. Really did a number on my confidence that day
‚Äúdon‚Äôt you know how to read?‚Äù 

‚ÄúI am, are you?‚Äù 

‚Äúyou‚Äôve gotta decide that for yourself, bud‚Äù 

‚Äúwere you looking for the men‚Äôs room? then yes‚Äù
My typical response is to ignore them and take care of business. Have yet to have anyone follow me into a restroom or further escalate things in the nearly 15 years I've dealt with things so take that as you will. I may just be lucky.
Are you?
A couple of times I just said ""yeah, I'm a man."" and carried on. One time the guy kept trying to talk to me but I ignored him because once the stall door closes, no one else exists.
Look them in the eyes, hold for a beat, ‚Äúoops‚Äù as cutely as possible, and proceed in either entering or exiting the restroom I intend to use
Stare them dead in the eyes and say with complete confidence ‚ÄúAre YOU in the right bathroom?‚Äù, then waltz off to do your business.
Yeah I‚Äôm supposed to meet your momma here
""No, you're in the left bathroom""
I got asked once and I just looked at the dude and said ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a guy.‚Äù And then he got bashful and apologized, I guess cause I have a deep voice and seemed irritated (cause I was). 

You could always point out the urinals to make your point. Or say, ‚Äúno ma‚Äôam, the Women‚Äôs restroom is on the other side‚Äù but also this seems like a good way to get beaten up
Learn some curse words in sign language and sign them when someone tries to talk to you. Don't respond verbally and pretend you don't understand them
My personal rule for bathrooms is: go where i feel safe. I tell the person‚Ä¶hope for the best‚Ä¶
""no. go piss in a bush.""
Say ‚Äúyeah I‚Äôm in the right bathroom‚Äù and act shocked and offended like how a cis person would react. It worked for me and makes the person asking feel embarrassed. Even though I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôre trying to be nice, it‚Äôs a good micro-revenge for misgendering you. But maybe I‚Äôm evil for thinking that haha
Look them dead in the eyes and tell them very confidently they‚Äôre wrong. Had a dude try to tell me I was in the wrong bathroom once and I just turned around and said ‚ÄúNo I‚Äôm not.‚Äù And he was so intimidated he left without using it. People do NOT like to be stood up to in bathrooms.
I'd look these asshole men in the eye, and as expressionless as possible, say: ""Oh, thanks, man. Are there urinals in the ladies' bathroom now? I'm about  to bust my nuts, dude.""{

And then go into the women's restroom. And pee.

Then walk out, and if the dude is still there, pretend to zip up and tell him, ""no urinals, dude. Had to whip it out and go the  sink. But hey, thanks for the tip. I'm gonna go in women's bathrooms from now on. They're lot cleaner than the ones for guys.""

Then walk away and try like hell not to but out laughing....
I typically have at the ready ‚Äúwhat, are you trying to look at my dick? That‚Äôs gay bro‚Äù in case someone tells me I‚Äôm in the wrong restroom
I'd go for ""Wait, what's a 'wrong bathroom' does it mean I can summon demons if I piss in the wrong toilet?""

Or ""Do you see toilets? Then it's the right fucking bathroom""

(Not trans, just pissed that bathrooms aren't treated like regular bathrooms)
I once bumped into someone in a grocery store bathroom (lmao) who did a double take and said ""This is the men's restroom"". My response was just a polite smile and ""Yes, I know."" Inside I was both laughing and crying, but outside I just clip-clopped blithely into the restroom in my little ankle boots and carried on with business as usual. At the time, I was wearing an androgynous outfit, which usually makes me trend more feminine in appearance. So that was probably why I ran into some trouble. So nowadays I try really hard to find a single-occupancy restroom, or if that's not an option, I pick the restroom that I think I'm least likely to get stopped in based on the way that I look that day.

In terms of what to say, I think that just answering the question or addressing the comment in a straightforward way that implies that you have no idea why they're asking, and every right to be where you are is kind of the only thing you can do... That or just stand there awkwardly, or pretend that you went into the wrong bathroom, I guess... But if I have to field questions, I just pretend like it's no big deal and like it's not at all weird being interrogated about why you're in a particular restroom. Like, idk about you, but I'm just here to pee. I don't want to see you any more than you want to see me!
I've had this happen, I just do as suggested and do it fast... Which is hard because his do you relax after being called out.

After the third time that happened I started using the women's restroom, nice but also anxiety inducing
Srep 1: Download 2 pics of Buck Angel, one the most masculine pic of him that you can find and one of him fully nude

Step 2: When confronted, pull up the non nude and ask ""would you tell this person to go to the ladies room?""

Step 3: When they inevitably answer ""no, of course not, that's a man!"" flip to the nude pic, shove it in their face and say ""yea, well this is Buck Angel and he's got a vagina, so how about you shut the fuck up and mind your own business you fuckin creep!""

Step 4: Enjoy going to the bathroom knowing that you just owned a bigot

I‚Äôm not trying to claim anything about where transpeople should go to pee, but I keep seeing this conceptual error around bathrooms that too many folks seem to have.
I get that minorities feel woke in that they experience and go through things a majority of people don‚Äôt. But, it makes not understanding cis-culture and being this lost on something as universal as a restroom come off as hypocritical. Like how‚Äôre you gonna judge cis people for not getting trans stuff and then turn around and not even know why bathrooms are the way they are :,D   It boggles me. 

Bathrooms were designed to protect people from harassment (they used to call it modesty but really that‚Äôs just sugar coating for harassment prevention). There are stalls to protect individuals within the room from harassing each other, then there are stalls for different sexes to protect harassment between sexes.

Bathrooms were designed assuming that 1) one could tell what sex you were.
2) that having ‚Äúgendered‚Äù or sex specific bathrooms does anything against harassment between sexes. 

People don‚Äôt correct you on which gender you‚Äôre supposed to be. Many people (especially older adults) haven‚Äôt even been exposed to the idea of gender being anything other than physical. They proceed under the notion that they can identify who is what, and that if someone of one sex is going into a space designated for another then either sexual harassment or lack of awareness is afoot.
Especially if they think you‚Äôre a male entering a women‚Äôs bathroom. 

People have this notion that a multi-person bathroom in a public place is where a predator would go to harass women. That having a sign saying ‚Äúhey no males in here‚Äù is gonna keep creeps out.
There‚Äôs also the fact that our culture conditions us to be sensitive to any remote opportunity of seeing the opposite sex exposed‚Äî even to pee and poo. 

The labeling of bathrooms isn‚Äôt based on the psycho-social concept of gender. It‚Äôs based on sex and heteronormative culture, hence why men‚Äôs bathrooms have urinals and women‚Äôs have toilets.


‚ÄúMen‚Äôs‚Äù and ‚ÄúWomen‚Äôs‚Äù; ‚ÄúLadies‚Äù and ‚ÄúGentlemen‚Äôs‚Äù on bathrooms are used as synonyms for the sexes because before gender psychology those terms were considered more humanizing, cultural, and more family-friendly than ‚Äúmale‚Äù and ‚Äúfemale‚Äù.

There‚Äôs no gender policing going on. Ya some folks are gonna cringe at the idea of different sexes mixing in bathrooms, and some are also transphobic, but if they‚Äôre telling you it‚Äôs the wrong restroom it‚Äôs because they think you‚Äôre a different gender or sex than what that space is designated for. 

Like. Ya‚Äôll are already well aware of how queer people are left out of consideration for things, but still assume gendered labels for public spaces that are decades old carry queer-inclusive meanings.
You know some, not all but *some* of those people, might just not be fully aware of how you want to be perceived, and are merely perceiving you as you are.

If I was a security guard in a building, and I saw what I observed to be a woman about to walk into the men's restroom, my first thought would be that you were about to walk in there on accident. 

You see, most people aren't pieces of shit.

If you just said, ""oh, I am a man"". It would solve 98% of these situations.

The person would say ""okay"" and that would be the end of it.

Some people don't want to get in trouble being in the wrong restroom, but you will notice it in their voice. A slight sarcastic or forced tone indicates an asshole trying to make his hateful point.
Don't be that one
Once when I was really little but needed short hair because long was too much of a pita, I legit had some old fart block me from going into the women's with his cane like ""that's the women's little boy!""

Like I mean I am a trans dude, but I was also tiny and following my mother you asshole.

Idk, this made me remember it for some reason.
‚ÄúYou wanna see my penis?‚Äù  Don‚Äôt have to have one, but it‚Äôll scare them enough to just leave you be
‚ÄúFuck you‚Äù
Say ""no, the womens is down the hall""
The right response Mace the haters and piss wherever you want.

Carrying an AKM is a good deterrence against transphobia >:)
‚ÄúMa‚Äôm the urinal is not for taking a shit.‚Äù
""What, you wanna watch or something? Fuck off."" As brutish as you care to say it.
When I‚Äôm confident enough to use the boys bathroom if I get asked this I plan on acting really offended like ‚Äú??? Bitch I‚Äôm a guy, wtf- you think I look like a girl?? You wanna see my dick or something bro? You gay? Is that what this is? You wanna see how girly my fists are in your face or smth?‚Äù Because that‚Äôs how I imagine a really defensive cis man would say if you told him he looked girly
""I GOT A COCK BRO"" In as broey a voice as possible.
""My balls are too big to use the ladies"" 
""I'm a dick so I'm going in."" 
""I'm also on the other side.""
My expression leans pretty masculine, so I get this a lot in the women's room. My go-to response is ""what, never seen a butch gal before?""
Who gives a shit? Everybody shits.
Happened to me BEFORE I was out which was funny. (Ftm) Came out of the women's washroom and was asked if it was the women's washroom. I said ""Yes."" In a very fem voice (Me: Short hair, boys shorts, baggy shirt). Guess I passed? üòÖ
‚ÄúIt accepts feces and urine if that‚Äôs what you‚Äôre asking?‚Äù
How do you even deal with using the mens room? It‚Äôs the most disgusting place in the world. I can‚Äôt bring myself to do it ü§¢
""WELL THAT DEPENDS ON HOW BIG THE SHIT'S GONNA BE.  ARE YOUR STOOLS USUALLY LARGE AND FIRM OR MORE WATERY OR ARE THEY LIKE RABBIT PELLETS?""

All of this must be shouted loudly enough that it can be heard through the entire surrounding area.
Look around confused on if they are looking at you. Then after a few seconds (once enough time for you to hypothetically realize they are talking about you has past) you look at them so confused, and just say ""Yes..."" and continue to look at them like they just asked the most stupid question. Then just walk on to the bathroom. If they continue to bother you, then just say, ""hey if this is meant as a strange pickup line, then sorry to tell you, but I don't swing that way"" OR ""hey if this is meant as a strange pickup line, then sorry to tell you, but you are not my type"".
just bounce the question back at them
I just want to point out that someone asking if you are in the correct bathroom is not inherently transphobic. Sometimes people DO walk into the wrong bathroom. 

Anyway just ignore them. It's not worth the hassle.
‚ÄúIdk - which one were you looking for?‚Äù
Person: am I in the right bathroom? 

Me: no your in the left bathroom.
I've never had anyone actually say something, but I would just say that I was in the right room, and give them a brief look of mild confusion. Maybe that response would make them feel awkward for having said something in the first place. Hopefully. I love making people feel awkward.

My experience is backward because I'm not out at work yet (ftm), but I guess I ""pass"" pretty well, because many women look at me funny when I'm in the bathroom. Sometimes they'll just stare at my chest forever while we're washing hands trying to figure out if I've got titties. I just look at them and nod to show that I recognize what room is it and that I didn't go in there by mistake.
I haven't had anyone ask me if I am in the right restroom but I have had people misgender me and my go to is look at them like they are crazy. Make the cis person uncomfy don't give them confidence establish your dominance
If I get asked why I‚Äôm in that bathroom my automatic response is to say ‚ÄúI live here‚Äù
How about
""Are YOU in the right bathroom?""

Make them question their gender.
‚ÄúGo away.‚Äù She says, knowing she‚Äôd never actually say that herself.
I'd ask the guard why I would care where the ladies room is when I'm a man. People should just mind their business.
probably idk
I think it has more to do with misogyny, women a weak and so men try to protect them. So they want to make sure you don‚Äôt walk in to a mens room that ‚Äúcould‚Äù be dangerous for the little frail woman.

Maybe it‚Äôs just because I‚Äôm in Silicon Valley, but I got a few surprised looks walking into the woman‚Äôs, but never anything said to me. Most the time I confidently walked in and didn‚Äôt get any strange looks.

Now I pass, so I‚Äôm just another girl in the bathroom. A tall girl, but a girl none the less.
Do it while backing slowly through the bathroom door.
That‚Äôs pretty much what I did when it happened to me and the dude got really embarrassed
Ask them are they in the right bathroom? Because if they have to ask maybe that's a bad sign.
In what situation would a cis person be misgendered?
this is mine now
100% have done this, they usually don't say anything after that and just try to move on with their day in that kinda ""life is weird sometimes"" way
that‚Äôs so fucking funny omg
They are mocking op not like confused...
I use the female bathroom most of the times out of fear tbh‚Ä¶ but the thing is, no matter how i dress or style my hair people still think im a lesbian ü•≤
I kinda have the same andro phase going on myself as well. I don‚Äôt ever use urinals though but it gets a bit awkward if I have to wait on a stall sometimes.
I still use the men's room, and boy does it feel hostile now
This is pretty funny
These are transition goals right here
(mtf) I just never use urinals. I like the peace of being able to go in a stall, then i also just can't be looked at at all. I also always use the men's out of courtesy for women who might feel uncomfortable, cause just because I Identify as female doesn't mean people aren't uncomfortable.
You... you use a urinal? I can't imagine. I'd rather die than pee standing up.
I'd take the means too until I am 100% passing because I think men have an easier time dealing with the situation than if it would be the opposite
Found mine.

Perfectly passive for my little air sign heart.
That‚Äôs actually excellent, thank you
Great response! It's not our job to make them comfortable ü§£ü§£

Oof I am stealing that one. Whenever someone asks this will be my go to.

What does that have to do with this?





I thought we were asking stupid questions, sorry.
Yes indeed, the confusion tactic. Genuinely a useful tactic for dealing with shitty people sometimes, because if they get confused enough they'll just go away.
Have you ever had a dream that that you um you had you'd you would you could you'd do you wi you wants you you could do so you you'd do you could you you want you want him to do you so much you could do anything?
>(Two of the guys at the urinals were then like 'i guess you never know nowadays huh?'

This is so odd to me. I always read that ""don't say A WORD to people, especially at the urinal"" was a cardinal rule of men's rooms. Hm.
""Thank god, when I saw you I thought I was in the ladies room!""
^^^^
""no this one is on the left""
""I thought this was the krusty krab"" is my new favourite

As funny as this sounds in imagination, cis men will definitely punch you for this
Yoooo nice PFP!

Forget return to monke, return to crab
That‚Äôs funny hahahhah
I dont believe in misgendering people on purpose but the second one is nice

Lol
Ma'am, I think you're in the wrong subreddit.
100% passing trans man walking into the females bathroom because he doesn‚Äôt have bottom surgery will get either screamed at or assaulted. It‚Äôll be worse for the trans woman walking into the mens room just because she hasn‚Äôt gotten bottom surgery.
Hey everyone, look at this totally cis person above me coming into trans subs to comment.

Totally normal. Totally normal cis things.

They must be a regular everyday cis person! Totally not subconsciously coming to trans subreddits to figure shit out. Nah, they just came here to be mean. Not to start realizing some things üòÇ

Edit: A lot of us have been there. Just come join the party. We're pretty friendly!
why are you even on this subreddit then? go fuck yourself and fill your sinuses with your own urine.
[removed]
To answer the question, though, they‚Äôre the weird ones for caring which restroom you choose, imo. Keep doing you, buddy. It‚Äôll get more comfortable.
Ok, I really like this one.
All sorts! My go to response to if someone calls me sir or something is ""Oh I'm a man now? hehe"" then I'll respond to whatever else they say in my most fem gruff voice.

Before my egg cracked and in my mid 20s when I was very androgynous presenting I was mistaken for a woman 3 times. I just laughed and kept on with what I was doing. I also ignored the huge amount of euphoria because being thought of as a girl was fun and normal right?
While that's true, if you treat them like they *are* confused, it will then, in fact, confuse them.

So it's a good strategy, shows you're confident, and that they may have misjudged the situation. :) I like it.
I totally understand. My husband is ftm and they HATE using either bathroom because of all the bs that goes along with it. They generally just wait till they can find a family bathroom.
This is why I don't use the bathroom from 6:30 AM - 5 PM on School Days :') I don't pass enough to go into the mens and I feel uncomfortable in the girls bathroom... Being a Gamer really helps with training that üòÖüòÇ
Saaaaaame. I am afraid of the men's room but i get stares in the women's room too . Like conservative  white grandma's confused if I have a penis or not
I am actually really surprised to hear that anyone cares about this. Women can get upset if a man walks into the women‚Äôs restroom, because they think he is a pervert. 

Men generally do not care. I‚Äôve been in restrooms before and a woman comes in, apologizes for whatever reason she had to go into the men‚Äôs room, and I‚Äôve never seen another man who cared. 

Honestly, if you are getting shit for doing this, I promise you, it is the minority of men who would care or say anything to you. 

I implore you to continue to go into the men‚Äôs room with confidence. Men don‚Äôt give a fuck who is in the bathroom with them. Anyone who has given you a look or said anything to you about this, is way less of a man than you, and I‚Äôm guessing they probably don‚Äôt have an issue with you using the men‚Äôs restroom, but are homophobic and hating on you because they think you are a lesbian. Because, if you were a blonde girl in a mini skirt, they wouldn‚Äôt have said shit to you. 

Fuck these people. Real men don‚Äôt give a fuck about this.
I remember what that was like pre-T. That‚Äôs actually the worst feeling ever. I know this route isn‚Äôt for everyone, but have you considered taking testosterone?
This is where I'm at.  Looking at me, honestly, nobody would think I wasn't anything but a cis guy... which is super unfortunate when you're MTF, 4 months HRT.  So if I absolutely have to, then I use the guys, as there is no way I could use the ones I want without a lot of hostility from other women; or worse... making them feel unsafe :(   


But then I personally don't feel right in the male toilets, and even if no-one can tell... I know.  And it feels like I don't belong there, which creates a feeling of hostility for me (so I don't feel safe, and just want to get out as fast as possible).  


Doesn't help with dysphoria, I can tell you that much!  So mostly I either hold it or find a disabled/gender neutral toilet to use instead.
Oh yeah it‚Äôs awesome, even better when you‚Äôre wearing a skirt. It really screws with their heads. Admittedly I prefer sitting but there‚Äôs a lot of public restrooms I don‚Äôt want to sit in.
No cause they might just answer no and that would **not** be fun
Right??
Also in response to that rude security guard, I would just go ""uh... Okay?"" And continue walking into the men's. They should get the point.
Draw from Obi Wan and hit em wirh a ""that's... Why I'm here""
It's like they're afraid they're gonna sexually assault you or something. üôÉ
That‚Äôs when you say ‚Äúnope just TRYING to use the restroom‚Äù
Well done
That's perfect
For the most part, it is, particularly if you don't know anyone else in there.

However, if you're with a buddy, talking does happen. I mean, you were having a conversation five seconds ago and you're _still_ standing right next to each other, so no reason to go quiet just because there's a pair of trickling sounds now.

Indeed, some of the most obnoxious conversations I've heard between a couple of guys happened in public bathrooms, and usually you could hear them before they even entered the bathroom, they talked loud enough to drown out toilet sounds, and they would leave still talking like they're trying to fill an auditorium with their voice. 

Also, exceptional circumstances often lead to exceptions to the rule. This kind of situation still, unfortunately, qualifies as exceptional in most places.
I assumed they knew each other because of the 3 urinals they were right next to each other with a gap on the other side? Also the rule had been broken by the other dude clocking me lmao
""I mean I just met Patrick"" if you wanna leave em with a diss
Yeah, definitely. Agreed. Mongoose of truths has said a mis-truth. :(

Damn mtf wife and ftm husband...nice couple
Yeah it‚Äôs kinda like a catch 22
They‚Äôre not asking if OP is in the right bathroom. They‚Äôre asking ‚ÄúAm *I* in the right bathroom?‚Äù
I just said ‚Äúyeah but im not a lady‚Äù and he said ‚Äúoh sorry‚Äù but i felt like it was a weak comeback
I'd probably tell the guard, ""Oh, thanks, I had no idea!""... and proceed to ignore them and carry on about my day, so same deal but more sarcastic.
""the linger you delay me the more likely I am to piss on this floor now LET ME THROUGH""
Them if they persist, you can get them for harassment.

Oh, well good for OP getting this thread trending on r/all!  

How many genders? Well, there is male and female. And then there is trans female and trans male. And then there is a spectrum in between male and female. 

Non-binary people are certainly valid. 

My most honest answer is, I haven't done enough research on other gender identities to give you a solid answer. The science is still relatively new.  I can only talk about my own gender identity issues being a transwoman.
Thank you, this is amazing
Thank you so much for sharing this link. I pass relatively well but have never been to a public bathroom since transiting so this is a godsend.
Hey thanks that‚Äôs awesome.
Omg this is amazing, thank you so much!!!‚ù§Ô∏è
It's like, straight, with extra steps
Oh right, yeah yeah. Had a brain fart lol.
No that's a great response. Think of if a cis guy gets misgendered like that, he'd probably respond with that or something along the lines of ""what...?"" ""What do you mean"" ""okay?"" Etc.
I like this response the best, as it leaves room for the possibility they were genuinely trying to be helpful, and still leaves you the way bigger person if they‚Äôre not üíï
That‚Äôs the best response. Or, ‚ÄúI know.  I‚Äôm a dude.‚Äù Just state your gender so they know they misgendered you and then keep doing your thing. All the witty comebacks are funny, but you really just need to correct the misunderstanding.
Agreed. I‚Äôm not the one to tell people what their gender is. It‚Äôs definitely their own business. 

What I‚Äôm confused about is why trans people would assume the signs on the door are referencing anything but biological sex? There are only two bathrooms.
Eh, it's heterosexual, but still pretty queer lol.
it's straight
There's no extra steps. That's a kinda shitty thing to say and minimises their identities
Its straight, with extra straps
Haha, also in an ftm/mtf relationship and we don‚Äôt view or identify our relationship as a straight or heterosexual relationship, decided that early on.
I believe this usage was a filler word, im guilty of using them in type as well sometimes.
, with extra steps
Oh you‚Äôd have to know the complete history of our relationship to see why it‚Äôs funny to us personally but yeah, definitely extra steps.
It‚Äôs a joke‚Ä¶ among trans people. We don‚Äôt need to police their speech here
Cool, and you get to use that for yourselves when describing your own relationship, but it shouldn't go beyond that.
I'm a straight trans person. My last relationship was with a trans guy. I'm telling you how it feels for me when you describe my relationships that way
We have no problems seeing other trans people solely as their chosen gender. It would be wrong to view them otherwise. For us however, aside from our relationship which is where the humor comes in, we tend to see ourselves as‚Ä¶ enhanced, I suppose would be the correct term. We wanted to be more than we were born as, more than the hand dealt by fate. Though medical science and force of will that is exactly what we have, and are continuing to become.
I kinda love that :)
Thanks. It‚Äôs born of well‚Ä¶ kind of a philosophical point for us. We are both trans-humanists, which itself has nothing to do with being transgendered, but transgender fits nicely into that philosophy."	t6pr9e	trans	1985	0.92	2022-03-04 18:40:02
I used the male bathroom for the first time!!!	I don't have much to say except I git so much euphoria! There was no one in there and contrary to my pre conceived idea about mens bathroom there weren't any men with their dicks out for the world to see! Although they are a lot less clean than the womens it brought me so much genuine euphoria k didn't care, I just washed my hands very thoroughly afterwards! Just had this share this with y'all!	"That‚Äôs amazing, dude!  So happy for you! üòä
Yeah, Brother, guys bathrooms are a hell hole! I'm happy for you in any case!
Ayyy nice!
congrats!!!!

wait til you get invited to the secret boys room poker game(jk)
You have to actually try to see dicks in the men's room. Don't.
That‚Äôs so awesome!! I‚Äôm glad friend :)
That‚Äôs awesome!
Congratulations super star! I‚Äôm immensely proud of any gender queer people for using the bathroom that matches their gender (it‚Äôs frickin scary) üñ§
Nice, that's awesome! May i ask, at what point in your transition you decided to do so? Because i have yet to make the same decision, but i'm still too devided... \^\^'
Yeah that‚Äôs a real bad part of being a guy. Having used a guy‚Äôs bathroom for almost 20-ish years you see some shit literally and figuratively
Yeah I didn‚Äôt know how much of a hellhole the guys toilets were till I started going to the girls toilets, I mean I knew they were hellholes but till then I had no perspective! 

Anyway Congrats on using the toilet of the gender you identify as that‚Äôs a big step regardless what transition you do!
That's awesome, good for you dude
Welcome, bro! ü§úüèøü§õüèª
I did too! I got my first short haircut yesterday, and decided to just go for it during a free period because most people were in lessons. 

There were 3 other guys in there? Nobody batted an eye. Confidence is the key
It kinda shocks me how many cis women think men's bathrooms are just filled with men doing helicopters. I was talking to my friend the other day and she described what she thought men's bathrooms were like - men walking around with their dicks hanging out constantly.
Transphobes: I have a right to not see [trans genitals] in the bathroom

Me: you're gods damn right. Wtf bathroom are you using where people are showing their genitals?
From my experience, guys are very self conscious about restrooms. They'll get right up into the urinal, and if someone uses the stall next to them they'll be like wtf and get REAL close to the urinal.
Hello. I had a very similar experience yesterday. It‚Äôs amazing!
Umm.. women pee all over the seats in women‚Äôs rooms and people pee all over the seat in unisex bathrooms also. Your eyeballs assuming you have working ones usually clue you in, I‚Äôd certainly hope all humans look before they sit down and have been since childhood!?!? You wipe the seat and put a cover if possible on the seat. Men sit to poop also and I assume most don‚Äôt just happily sit on a pee covered seat.  This is universal to public toilets.
You go dude üòé
Hey congrats ‚ô°
congrats dude :D
Im so happy for you man! Thats great!!!
Ive worked in a restaurant before where i had to clean both rooms and most of the time the women's are way dirtier than men's üòÖüòÖ
It indeed does smell... Glad ya got the courage to do it! 

I hope I will be able to do the same with the other door.
Congrats <3
Congrats
Dudes don't tend to even look at each other in the bathroom
that‚Äôs amazing, so proud of you! i would def recommend to bring your own wipes and other stuff cuz men‚Äôs restrooms are filthy
I am proud of you!
Somewhat off-topic:
If the toilet is very messy, but there are no others to use and you relaly have to go. I always get some toilet paper fold it a lot and then clean where I want to sit. If the toilet is to even to messy for that, you take some more toilet paper and sit on that instead of the bowl. (it is very rare though, but I still wanted to help. Although it is pretty obvious, I also miss obvious things lots of times, so I thought it might be useful to mention.
I just used a unisex one for the first time at school too :D
Doing the happy dance of joy and also you will want to wear thick work boots in male public bathrooms. Just from my experience cleaning them. 

Yippeee!!!
Congratulations Dude on a job well done and Thanx for washing your hands,*üòäüíÅüèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èüôÄ
Congrats!!! It's so awesome to feel comfortable in places you should be welcomed in ... Aside from the smell ,:-p
>there weren't any men with their dicks out for the world to see!

Not sure what you mean by that. There are definately men with their dicks out in urinals, but they only have their dicks out when they use the urinals, and they put them back afterwards. And they only have their dicks out, not their trousers off.

Men don't go walking around the bathroom with their dicks hanging out. But they *do* take their dicks out to use urinals.
So happy for you, man! You‚Äôre killing it!!!
This will be me soon but I don't think I pass well enough to go in there
Dude I hope you didn't have to sit. We pee on those seats!
If I were you I'd continue ue using the women's bathroom for the extra space to potty but that's just me lol.
aw thanks dude!
Used to have to spot-clean the bathrooms at the end of the night working in a pub, girls just throw toilet paper everywhere like it's confetti, in the guys bathrooms they just can't aim for shit, which usually means ""biohazard cleaning"" so I didn't have to do it.   


Women's are definitely messier, men's are definitely smellier.
yeah ture, thanks anyways bro
thanks!
Wait, when cis male, I've never been invited to the secret boys room poker game :'(
Yeah, also it's important to respect the urinal rules.
Why is it scary?  I'm a middle aged man and I have never paid much attention to who else is in the washroom. It's common for women to come into the men's when the line is too long for the ladies toilet. I don't care as long as they don't stand at the urinal next to me. 

I think the bathroom controversy is about mtf people in the ladies. I've never met a man who is opposed to transmen in the restroom with them. Most of them are indifferent to people who present as women in there either.
I haven't physically transitioned at all yet if that's what u mean?
Lots I think is not wanting comparison or of having unusual anatomy, some innate protecting of their ""precious"" and, with some at least, fear of homoerotic gaze (or getting hard themselves).

At least that's how I remember it from my ancient history.
ummmmmmmmmmmmmm i still have a vagina, how else was I going to wee?!!! omg r u serious? u guys r disgusting holy shit ewww!
""Can't aim for shit""!üòÇ
Being AMAB I never understood how anyone could ever use a standing urinal - it's like the most uncomfortable and awkward thing ever. I'd rather stay in line for half an hour for a proper stall
Probably depends on where you are. I was a custodian for a cleaning company and every single building I cleaned, I dreaded the women's restroom. I don't even want to guess how many smelly, bloody stalls/clogged toilets I had to deal with. I'd rather clean up a bit of piss on the floor/toilet seat any day.
Came here to say put many hours in cleaning bathrooms at a bar and the men's were often almost unused looking other than some piss by the urinals and the women's were toxic. Pads, pons, diapers, paper everywhere and piss all over the seats from hover pisses.
It is so secret, that it has no members. Sssst. There is or always a hidden button in the 5th bathroom stall behind the toilet, or it is 21st tile on the right. You can be the first member of the super duper secret club.
/r/egg_irl
Oh, really? In that case it's probably just my low ass confidence stopping me from using public restrooms xD 
My voice is already in development and i think i might have to make up my mind about the toilet question soon. Don't really want to get in trouble for using the girls restroom as a guy...
Thanks for the quick and honest answer. ^^ Helped alot
Ah damn RIP. Did you at least put toilet paper down? Use sanitizer on the seat? I always try to avoid them when I can and I'm somebody who prefers sitting to pee. Also I believe there is like camping equipment that's kinda like a vag funnel for peeing that lots of people use. Alternatively you could just squat over the seat. Anyway glad your dysphoria is getting better. Just thought I'd give a bro a tip.
[deleted]
I was also very uncomfortable, but they were definitely quicker to use and get out of the space with so much male smells. I always tried to get one between me and the next person - I didn't want to see anything or especially be seen. Though sometimes that unused white porcelain seemed like a invitation to a guy's heatseeking missile to emerge within my sight. All my plans seemed to end in me silently screaming ohhhh noooo like in the Home Alone movie.

Worse were the trench style which thankfully were not much used in the U.S. I really hated those as there was nowhere to hide but the stalls.

However most times the stalls tended to be few or even only one or two in many men's rooms and disgusting with all kinds of musky smells but moreso by misogynistic stuff written on or scratched into the walls.

I was even uncomfortable on seeing my dad's on the rare instance of seeing his. His size amazed me, but also repulsed me despite my having the same basic model of crotch decor as what I had then.
Thank you! I have always preferred the stalls, and I‚Äôd say ‚Äúit‚Äôs because I like my privacy‚Äù, but now I think I figured out the reason why... #MTF
One of the men's I worked cleaning had a to-the-floor trough urinal, the floor tiles were also angled slightly so run off would go into the trough. Easiest thing to spot clean since I'd just have to spray the porcelain for the autoflush thing to do, and then yeet a bucket of water-and-bleach solution across the floor and use the mop to push it and any piss on the floor into the trough.   


Never deep-cleaned it though, didn't get paid enough for it.   


One time there were coins in the trough and people were watching other patrons of the bar come in and out trying to work out who's going to reach in for like ¬£2 in change.

yeah but that costs money and I have to buy it and my parents and that's just a massive effort
Wat
Yer welcome JT. It's been years at least since I remembered any of that stuff. I havn't been in a multiple unit men's room in decades now. Somehow the negatives persist in my memory. 

I transitioned totally out and notorious in one of my 2 jobs after a year layoff and they had me use the nurse station or just put a unisex sign on a men's room and added a slide bolt for my privacy. At least the urinals were behind the stalls so I was able to ignore them.

My other job wasn't so tedious and I just used the women's. Most knew my status there too, but were not so difficult. I was actually helped to socially transition professionally in that hotel Banquets department constantly having multitudes of interactions with all the employees and public. I got the chance to grow into being fully myself.

It totally changed my personality for the better and I usually became upbeat, where before I was mostly pessimistic and often had a huge chip on my shoulder. Being accepted as a woman is really emotionally transformational."	mq1tnx	trans	1938	0.96	2021-04-13 13:04:16
I (FTM) have to change in the girls' changing room - is there any way I can make sure the girls don't feel uncomfortable with me being there?	"Basically, I am in secondary school and have been openly out as trans (FTM) for around 6 months. I am pre-t but am lucky enough to pass pretty well and am almost never misgendered or mistaken as a girl.

While the school is pretty chill with me being trans, and let me wear the boys' uniform etc. without a problem, my parents are not, and they will not let me change in the boys' changing rooms, get my name changed on the system or in fact do anything where they have a say. This is not a massive issue for me since the girls in my year know I am trans and are comfortable with changing with me when we change for PE, but whenever I go to change for extra-curricular sports (most often to go to the gym after school) and am in the changing room with a bunch of girls from other years who don't know me or know that I am trans, I can't help but feel that I make them hugely uncomfortable and I hate it. They will sometimes ask me what I'm doing here and almost always give me dirty or confused looks, and, of course, this is not their fault - I would probably feel the same way if I were in their situation. 

Unfortunately, the changing room is very open-plan and I am not allowed to change in a bathroom, and, since there is not really anywhere I can go to hide, I more or less have to change in a corner with my head down. This does not really bother me, but I still feel really shitty about invading a space for girls and making everyone uncomfortable.

Is there anything I can do to make the girls feel ok with me being there?"	"OP, if your school is supportive they will let you change where you want and your parents don't have to know. I am a teacher and run the LGBT club at my school and high key do shit all the time without telling parents. It's part of my job. Pretty much none of the students in my club are out to their parents. Our lgbt fieldtrips have vague descriptions so parents don't even know their kid is in the club. I hate to say this but often a major aspect of being lgbt is being selective about what you tell your parents. Sometimes you just have to keep things from them for your own mental wellbeing

When it comes to being trans, get used to doing what you want and not telling your parents (within reason of course). You do not need their permission to be yourself or to do what you need to do to be safe.
tell your parents that you make the girls uncomfortable by being in the girl's room, and tell them to let you change in the boy's one.
Tell the school this is a problem and go to the mens room. 
I dnt think its your parents business where you go change cloths thats qctuly super creepy that they care.
Wait... Why can't you change in the bathroom?
I would say ""I'm sorry, but because my birth certificate was mislabeled my parents and the school refuse to let me use the correct changing rooms. I'd bring it up with the school and maybe the district to see if they can get the code changed so it doesn't require parental permission to use the other changing rooms. I have just as much of a problem with it as you do""
thats just the downside of beeing a Transgender kid to be honest ... if your parents dont allow you anything youre basically fucked.
Just be strong and maybe tell the girls whats going on ... i van understand that ghey would feel IMMENSLY uncomfortable if a guy is changing with them ..
or maybe go change in the toilette or smth :D
I just changed in the bathroom stalls. Maybe that could work? It‚Äôs what I used to do when I was in secondary. Sorry if this doesn‚Äôt help that much.

(Also, sympathy about your parents, that sucks.)
How do your parents know what changing room you're using? Or is there a teacher there checking everyone at the entrance?

(I only have my school for comparison, where teachers would never know what changing room you used unless students complained or something.)
Have a trans flag near you ! And a pronoun pin ! That way the girls would be less uncomfortable !
When I was in school, I always located the least-trafficked area in the locker room to change. You could do this (if there is such an area) and maybe face the wall so you're not facing the girls in there? That might make them more comfortable -

Also, if your teachers/coaches/etc know you're trans, ask them if there's anything they can do to help you without your parents knowing. They might just make an exception for you to change somewhere else if they understand the situation.

Obviously don't out yourself to anyone you don't want to be out to, though. Just a suggestion. Good luck!
Why are you not allowed to change in a bathroom stall? Seems like a very strange rule
Talk to your school to see if they let you use the staff or disabled toilets. you might have to be open to them about your parents and be open that you think your making people unconfutable hopefully school might understand let you use them.

Only thing I can say is keep your eyes facing the wall and only the wall. any mark can help be it on a bag like pin or badge don't need to be on uniform just on a bag

over all its a school problem and you need chat with the school
You are very tough mentally, and I envy it.
Why the fuck, as a society we allow children to just pile in a room ad get naked together? Yet girls can't wear tank tops.... What the actual fuck is wrong with public schools?
Disobey your parents?
Op you sweet sweet man. Pretty much the whole point is because you are wanting to avoid  the potential upsetting of absolute strangers. 

Truth be told I don‚Äôt think a better solution can come then you just explaining the situation to them and if they understand bam solid human.  if they don‚Äôt then they probably got raised to believe that from their parents and it‚Äôs gonna take time; maybe too much time some kids are just hateful. 

I‚Äôd say carry your head high and build up regular dialogue with the people who are usually in there with you. So when new people come in even though you appear different you are just like everyone else a human trying to change. 

People should view it like that more often.
One thing that's pretty valuable is making friends with the school nurse, they usually have a backroom and I'm pretty sure if you talk to them they might let you change there, just gotta be super honest. The school nurse was my homegirl because growing up I had severe stomach issues and pains and she'd let me just hang out in the back until I was good. Worth a shot honestly
To consider:

The school‚Äôs official position will always be no, however, if you are caught sneaking into the guys room the gym coach might magically not see you. You are just that sneaky. 

The school could never tell you this avenue was open to subvert your parent‚Äôs choice because that would risk lawsuit. But if you came up with it and didn‚Äôt tell anyone, you would take the fall if you are too obvious and then be punished by the very people who agree with you, if the coaches choose to see you at all. 

The school could probably come up with some very creative punishments that aren‚Äôt actually punishments. A firm talking to each time perhaps.

I won‚Äôt endorse this idea I just want to throw it out as something that could be considered.
Can't you just go change in the boy's changing room without asking? 

If your school is fine with you being trans and student wont complain there is no way your parents would ever know.
It's not your problem. It's theirs.
Not sure if it‚Äôs an option for you but if your school has stalls in the bathroom your school has you use, you can maybe change in there. MTF and I get dressed in the boys bathroom stalls to avoid being surrounded by a sausage fest. You could also always wait outside your changing room until everyone else is done and quickly change after, you‚Äôll only be a few seconds later than everyone else. Sorry if neither of these are viable but that‚Äôs all I‚Äôve done since I don‚Äôt like confrontation ;^;
I don‚Äôt really get why people feel uncomfortable, it might because of my low emotional intelligence lol
I have an idea..... use the male changing room????
change on the grass as protest
[deleted]
Heya! Also had this problem. If there‚Äôs any single toilets perhaps ask to use those? That‚Äôs what I did, got a note saying I could use them.
Best choice you have in this is to change in a broom closet or a gender neutral toilets.
Why can‚Äôt you use the bathrooms? I‚Äôm confused on that part.
I remember having similar-ish problems as an mtf teen in the southern us. Too sexy for the boys to be trusted around us, and rugged to be accepted by the girls. ü§©ü•∫

Eventually the solution that my teachers decided on was that I would change in the coach‚Äôs office while she waited outside. It isn‚Äôt ideal, but it worked.
Only real suggestion I have is to wait outside for the girls to finish, and then get changed in privacy. It'll mean you're late, and it's an inconvenience to you, but it does make a quite clear statement dividing you from girls. There are definitely possible problems. It's almost definitely going to be confrontational with teachers who either tell you to get changed and then see you outside waiting; or find you to be constantly late to the next class. It's a fault of the people who force you into this situation, but that doesn't mean they'll rationally understand your stance.

I wish you the best in any case. I hope things change for you, or at the very least, I hope you find a way to get by until you can graduate out of that place.
Is there anyone who works for the school that you're close with? Perhaps you could speak to them about maybe making a space for you to change specifically for the extra curricular sports. It's a small step, but it probably has the best chance at proceeding.
Personally, I was a pretty bold kid and rebelled against stupid rules. If you are feeling bold and brave, try any of the following:

1. Change in the bathroom anyway. Tell no one, do not justify yourself. ""I have to pee. And now I am ready for sports.""

2. Don't change. Get your uniform grimey and make it your parents' problem

3. Change in the hallway. Make everyone uncomfortable!

4. Bring in a room divider and leave it in the changing room. Change behind it

5. Drop out of extracurricular sports that require you to change where your parents have a say. Take up rec sports or a different hobby where public clothing changes are not a thing.

6. Use the boys changing room anyway. Get in trouble. When interrogated by your parents or school administrator, use only ""I am a boy. I use the boys changing room."" No need to explain yourself further.


A bunch of these strategies may be embarrassing to you, but they also embarrass the heck out of your parents. Force them to face that they are the ones making the girls (and their son) uncomfortable, not you. You are not at fault and have nothing to apologize for.
Ask if you can change in the coach's office, its what I did when I was in high school.
Not sure if this would work for you or not, but if you could get a petition to take with you, and get as many girls to sign it saying that you're presence there is making you uncomfortable, then they might not have much of a choice but to let you change elsewhere.
Would it be possible to get the equivalent of a single stall all to yourself?
Does your school possibly have a coaches office or coaches locker room? My school did and they had locks on the door due to the fact it was for adults to change in but I got permission to use it or I could show up late to change after everyone left as long as I was quick and leave early to change before everyone got in the locker room. You would still be using the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù lockeroom or coach locker room (according to what your parents think) but not making anyone uncomfortable. You would have to talk to your coach and your administration but it could be something.
My parents don‚Äôt want me in the male changing rooms either, the compromise was to use the disabled unisex toilets, it‚Äôs a pain in the ass when they‚Äôre both in use (there‚Äôs only 2) but it‚Äôs better then being in the girls changing room (not many girls like me so it would be super awkward) maybe ask to use the disabled bathroom because it‚Äôs a lot better then using the girls.
Girls were always chill with me changing with them because they were comfortable knowing I too grew up with bodies like theirs, but they understood the politics of being trans and why I was in their changing room (though your school is supportive but it‚Äôs your parents that aren‚Äôt, which in my situation is was that both were against it). I think you‚Äôll be just since you already said you‚Äôre openly trans. For the others that don‚Äôt, just say ‚ÄúI‚Äôm trans sorry ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è‚Äù. Idk man. Often I just own my transness and don‚Äôt take shit or stares from anybody. It‚Äôs never my problem when someone is uncomfortable with my transness‚Äî it‚Äôs theirs.
Are you able to refuse to change at all?
Speak to your coach directly, they might have a equipment room or private office they can let you change in.
I suppose you could take the passive-aggressive approach, and print out something saying 'The only reason why I'm here is because my transphobic parents refuse to accept the fact that I'm a guy, and the school, for some reason, won't let me get changed in the male changing rooms as a result. If you have any complaints on the matter, please contact the school office, and tell them to let me use the male changing rooms, regardless of my parents objecting to it. Honestly, I don't want to be getting changed here either.' or words to that extent, and, whenever you're getting changed, get some blu-tack and stick that on the wall, so the others know who to complain to.

This may sound rather cynical, but chances are they'll be more willing to allow you to use anything but the female changing room if cis people start complaining about you being in the aforementioned changing room.
I used to just go in a stall but no one knew I was Trans back then. Not very helpful information but I extend my sympathy and support<3
Honestly you don‚Äôt need your parents‚Äô permission to get changed in the boys‚Äô changing room but if it‚Äôs really impossible for you to do so, what about having something indicating you‚Äôre trans? Like a bracelet or a keychain in your bag with your uniform that has the trans flag‚Äôs colors, so that people will notice right away why you‚Äôre there and won‚Äôt be so uncomfortable. Personally I would have more trust in knowing something about someone through their actions than their words. Sadly many people could be suspicious of your intentions and lies can slip through one‚Äôs mouth very easily, but if they see the trans stuff in advance before you even get to say anything, I am sure they will feel secure and you won‚Äôt be questioned as often, which will be good for both sides. But really, this idea is just a secondary one because the best is for you to get changed where you feel like you should be at, and it‚Äôs not like your parents need to know, you can ask the school to let you and keep it a secret from your parents. If they are so lgbtqia+ supportive as you described, I am sure they‚Äôll have no problem with that. Trans items do slap though, would definitely walk around with it if I wasn‚Äôt closeted and lived in a yet to be supportive country.
First up, so sorry you are in this situation, OP. It sounds as uncomfortable as hell.

If you have allies amongst the girls, could you ask them to back you up? Some others have suggested you talk to the teachers. Likewise if the lads feel sorry for you.
If you live in the US, federal guidelines to the Department of Education require that public schools allow you to use the facilities you want and be called what you want, your parents can‚Äôt stop this.

I‚Äôm sorry you have that home situation, you deserve far better.
I went to an all girls school catholic school, and while a lot of parents weren‚Äôt happy with the idea of me being there, the girls were fine. I myself wasn‚Äôt comfortable with it and for the most part the girls just left me alone. The ones who did have a problem with it would either wait till I was out or go in after. But overall 95% did not care. The school should be working with you to find a way for you to be comfortable. I personally threatened to go the education board if they didn‚Äôt help. Best of luck :)
After taking everyone else‚Äôs advice and you still can‚Äôt even change in the bathroom for some reason, work with the school to get a room divider/change curtain in a tiny section of the girl‚Äôs changing room so you can go there. 

But I‚Äôd tell the school that it could be a legal issue too if one of the girl‚Äôs parents complain.
i had this same problem, i usually change in the bathrooms beforehand! hope this helps
i think a lot of people here already gave good answers. i just wanna say, you‚Äôre a real gentleman for considering the girl‚Äôs feelings in this situation. we need more men like you!
oh god this ~~might be~~ is a ~~bad~~ terrible idea, but are you allowed to wear a packer at school, and if so is there a limit to realism?  XD

>Is there anything I can do to make the girls feel ok with me being there?

Girls don't have to be comfortable with a dude changing with them and that would be the fastest way for state of matter to change.

If girls in the changing room get to raise a problem out of it and protest or involve *their* parents in the matter it's the fastest way for *you* to get more comfortable.
I would just face the locker and change off to the side when I was in softball
They still didn't appreciate me being in there, but it's all I could do ü§∑üèª
Could you maybe show up early and change becore the girls get there? Or after they are done and be a few minutes late? If you have an understanding teacher they might help you make that work.

If you don't feel comfortable making a big announcement ""hey, I'm trans, sorry I'm not in the mens room, my parents are jerks"" maybe see if some of the girls can spread the word around for you.
I know my school had showers with curtains and bathroom stalls in the changing rooms for gym. I basically did anything I could to change out of their view and I didn't linger too long . could you ask to change somewhere else? Like go to a nearby restroom or something if the school still says you have to change there?
I would say just change where u want fuck your parent s
i might speak to the school again then and see what happens. thanks!
I could definitely use a teacher like you 5 years ago when I was in highschool.

What a shame that as far as I know, Spain doesn't have anything like this at all
You mean I could have gone to gay class and pretended to study?üò±
Thank you for being such an awesome teacher!
Bless you you're a lovely person
I wish my school was like that. We have a lgbt club, some gay teachers, and lgbt safe zones classrooms in school but our club is made up of a few people and slurs are always yelled out in the hallways with little to no punishments. And parents are always informed on everything unless you have great teachers which I am lucky to have.
You are so awesome. I'm a school psych, and I would love for this to be a thing at every high school and middle school.
> we went to a gay neighborhood

I'm sorry, ""gayborhood"".
You sound like a great teacher!!
That is awesome, you are awesome
You remind me a lot of my diversity club teacher back in middle school and thank you for doing that for students
God I wish there was someone like you at my school when I was in high school.
You should do an AMA
I've spoken to them loads but they won't let me. They say I am a ""confused girl"" and even got mad at the school when they suggested I use the boys' changing room.
I was wondering this, too. It seems if the school is advocating for him to use the appropriate dressing room, they'd allow usage of the bathroom. Furthermore, it's disturbing this isn't allowed as a general rule. So many people have physical disabilities/abnormalities that they are self conscious of, and I bet this rules keeps a lot of people from playing sports or participating in whatever might require one to change clothing.
They said the school wants them to use the boys changing room too but his parents won't let him
Could also maybe convince some of the parents of the girls to sue OPs parents over them basically forcing their girls to change with a boy over the protestations of the boy and the school itself.
thanks, im not really allowed to change in the bathroom but at this point idrc i‚Äôll do it anyway
nope there‚Äôs always a teacher inside the changing rooms to supervise
The uniform doesn't really allow, it but I think that's a good idea. I might just do it anyway and see what happens! Thanks
yeah i‚Äôll defo speak to them. they all know i‚Äôm trans anyway
Haha thanks I haven‚Äôt heard that one before :)
thank you! i will try talk to them, but i don‚Äôt want to just go up to them like ‚Äúi‚Äôm trans btw‚Äù if they haven‚Äôt asked. might find a pin badge or smth instead
i think it‚Äôs more that the girls that don‚Äôt know me don‚Äôt actually know i‚Äôm trans, so they think i‚Äôm just a cis boy in the girls room
Assuming not texas or florida :,(

California they cant do anything to stop me :)
Because it explains the struggle. And even though he‚Äôs a boy, he arguably knows a girls body pretty well.
I hope you have some luck,  this makes me glad to have avoided locker rooms after elementary school.  It sounds inappropriate for the school to not at least give you a different way to get ready for things where you'd need relative privacy as the other people in your classes.
It's appalling to me that they won't let you change in a bathroom, at least! Even without being trans, no one should be forced to change in front of people if they're uncomfortable with it.

If they won't let you switch locker rooms, maybe at least push for being allowed to change in a bathroom stall, or something that allows some privacy.
Do you have any friends with human parents who could complain about their kid changing beside a boy? Not sure if that would help you hit it‚Äôs a though.
Is there a way you can get permission to change not in a changing room at all (since your parents refuse) and change in a bathroom or friendly teachers room instead? I know it‚Äôs not fair bc you deserve to use the accurate (mens) changing room just like everyone else, but it might make you more comfortable
Emphasis on the fact that you feel that you may be making the girls feel uncomfortable as you are a boy in their space.
At the very least, the school could make an allowance for you to change in a bathroom. It‚Äôs ridiculous to me that they haven‚Äôt made that very easy accommodation.

If you‚Äôre having trouble with admin at your school specifically, try to find a teacher or other school employee who will go to bat for you. Admin might be more willing to listen to them.
[deleted]
well, sorry. Is the school required to out you? if not, you can maybe talk with the administrators to let you use the boy's one anyway, and not tell your parents.
They‚Äôre confused parents. No airquotes there.
I'm sorry for what you're going through but props to your school for at least attempting. 

I couldn't see any school here even think of suggesting that 
(Florida resident here)
I‚Äôd ask the school if you can use it without parent permission. Explain how your parents are transphobic and don‚Äôt agree with anything you try to say. Tell the school others are getting uncomfortable
I wanna fight them.
imma speak to them and basically say that if i can‚Äôt change with the guys i‚Äôm going to change in the bathroom for the sake of the girls
I've seen advice like this a few times in the thread, and I guess I just wonder about one thing.  Seems like that kind of pressure would just influence the school to say ""okay, don't set a policy, but no sports for this particular individual.""

Sadly I don't have better info.
Yeah, good idea.
This is starting to sound a lot like ""you can have a different opinion, as long as it's the same as me"". If they offer you only one choice there is no choice at all. Don't fall for these mental gymnastics and stand up for at least a compromise. Can't dress here and there, then what's the problem with dressing in a private room? Seems like a solution for just about everyone involved. If they're not willing to compromise beware of your personal boundaries. Never ever let anyone force you something you aren't comfortable with.
You have a teacher watching you change? That's kinda creepy.
Just stick a pin badge on your PE bag or something
Trans coloured face mask!
Right I was worried my comment came off potentially sounding like that. Much more along the lines of just acting like you usually do. Never directly addressing it unless asked
Oh boy, that is really not ideal. What a nightmare
I'm 28 and wanna be in your class
Unfortunately, the school can't do anything like that without my parents' permission. I have spoken to them before but they aren't willing to budge since they risk legal action being taken against them.
Confused ""parents""
I'm glad you have the strength to do that! I'd have given up when I was young. I hope it goes well!
I mean, the policy should be ""parents don't get a say"". Children are not possessions, no matter how much some parents opt to treat them that way.
lmao is that not normal??? it‚Äôs always a female teacher for the girls room and a male one for the boys room
That sucks :( 
In France our education minister made a ‚Äúlaw‚Äù which makes the school a safer space and they are not obligated to out us anymore. Teachers have to call us by our name and I‚Äôm lucky enough to be able use a changing room which is reserved just for me during my PE hours so no one could see me changing ( I don‚Äôt feel ok to change in front of people no matter their gender but particularly boys ). You don‚Äôt have this solution I guess ?

Edit : grammar and orthography
well that sucks. Good luck in your transition!
OP where do you live? In my state it is the opposite - it's illegal for schools to out students to parents and illegal for them to deny trans students to use their preferred bathroom. You really should look into the law where you live instead of taking their word for it and reach out to an adult you trust at the school (counselor or teacher). Your school may actually be in violation of the law despite them saying the opposite
If there are no other options, perhaps you can change in the bathroom? Better than nothing
If you do it without notifying the administrators first, who do you think is going to stop you or tell your parents?
thanks :)
I agree.  I do. 

But OP is an actual person in an actual school in the actual world.

""Should be"" is great when we debate new legislation and stuff.

When people's lives are at stake, I think it's valid to consider ""will be"" instead  ¬Ø\\\_(„ÉÑ)\_/¬Ø
Not where I am from anyway, but customs vary. Our teachers didn't really come near the student changing rooms unless we were taking waaaaay too long.
whoa, that was definitely not a thing when I was in high school. I think it is pretty messed up to have an adult in the teens' change room yeah.

this world is absolutely nuts. because apparently we can't have basic rights for trans people, but this is considered fine??
No. It is definitely not normal in my books
Not even in early elementary where im from, even tho it would not be as big of a surprise if a teacher came in to get us out after we had been messing around for too long
If something were to happen to him in the boys' bathroom, the school would be liable and you can bet the parents would sue as they went against them.
I hope it all goes well
You got this! üíïüå∏The school should accommodate. You have every right to feel comfortable, and you shouldn‚Äôt feel like you‚Äôre making others feel uncomfortable either.  So sad that this is even an issue in our society üôÉ
For sure, which is why I suggested having other parents pressuring the parents directly, rather than pressuring the school.
Pretty sure my elementary school didn't even have any male teachers, so no clue who they would have watch the boys if they did something like that."	ua1dcl	trans	1892	0.93	2022-04-23 09:08:13

The Men's bathroom is heaven	"So I'm trans(FtM) and I'm deep in the closet so I don't pass at all and today I ""accidentally"" went into the men's bathroom. My God was it beautiful, it was gross and nasty but beautiful. I felt so happy it felt right it felt like the place I was meant to piss and shit. It was truly amazing before being kicked out."	"Congratulations on your ""accident""! I'm so glad that you find the men's room so exciting and hope it continues to live up to your gross, pee-crusted dreams.

In all seriousness, though, euphoria from using the correct bathroom is really something, isn't it? It feels just right somehow. I'm glad you got to experience it and wish you many future visits.
I‚Äôm the opposite xd I was also surprised by how gross women‚Äôs restrooms are. I just thought they‚Äôd be spotless, smh. But it‚Äôs so validating!!! I feel awesome whenever I go pee in there, and it‚Äôs been almost a year since I last went into a men‚Äôs bathroom üòÖ
As an mtf, I don't get it, but I'm glad it makes you happy dude.
That's awesome bro. And yeah I can definitely relate to that, the mens toilet is gross but I feel so happy going in there :D
Smells SO bad and the floor is SO sticky. ugh See ya in there, mate haha
>It was truly amazing before being kicked out.

I apologise for asking, but who kicked you out?
I find it beautiful that us trans men can find such happiness and wonder in male experiences that cis men typically gloss over because they're so normal to them. Same with trans women and female experiences, I bet.

I'm happy you were able to experience this :] I'm looking forward to the day when I can use one
Aaayyy congratulations üéâ

That's a big step üíñ
Tbh the womens washroom is gnastier. Theres blood under the toilet seats. Some women feel the need to stand on the toilet and pee from 15 ft above the toilet....
Using the proper bathroom IS good and proper and validating.  Keep it up! If you catch my drift...
You were kicked out, someone spoke to you! Wow im surprised.
mens bathrooms are horrible but euphoria >>>
Congrats on discovering the other side! I hope the smell wasn't too bad. I know that's what always got to me. That and a bunch of burly men shuffling about while I'm just trying to piss. (Turns out I was uncomfortable because I was very trans and very gay ü•¥)
Kind of a weird observation but I get it! ‚ù§Ô∏èüå∏
How can they kick u out and found out womens bathroom can be just as gross to lol
Both toilets are exceptionally gross. Such is the life of everyone using those places.

Congrats love, that's funny and I'm glad.
[deleted]
I love this.
I've started transitioning socially, and I don't feel comfortable going into the women's bathroom yet. When I've been wearing a skirt, and using the men's bathroom the atmosphere feels so hostile. Its something else.
Im so happy for you!!!!
I'm glad this makes you happy but I don't think any amount of gender euphoria could justify how gross the men's room is. The urinals always have piss under them and the toilets seats are covered in piss because people don't want stand in piss but then no one lifts the seat.
Why would you be kicked out? I find guys tend to not give a shit who's in there. I often used it before my transition
Haha that feeling wears off! The mens loos are disgusting! 

Yesterday I was hovering my ass over a loo that had piss all around the seat ü§¢

But I guess I still get a little thrill out of using the correct toilets. 

Hope you are able to come out soon :)
Cannot imagine wanting to be in there lmaoü§¢  


The last time I went in the mens at the mall there was literally a giant turd laying out in the middle of the floor
Congrats guy!
Well, you have fun.

Personally, I don't miss seeing the puke halfway up the walls or shit in the urinals. üôÑü§¢
ƒ∞ wish someday i also find myself in women's bathroom accidentally:)
Glad you found your euphoria. As someone who has worked in a trade where I was in mens/womens  restrooms daily I can without a doubt say both are typically gross. However if I had to pick one overall mens would win the gross war, but I‚Äôve been in some woman‚Äôs restrooms that won battles.
Lmao, I'm glad you love it, but a trans girl, I hate(d) the men's bathroom so much
Lmao- despite also being a man, I have been using my women‚Äôs restroom privileges‚Ä¶.why must the men‚Äôs room be so disgusting
I have done this it is heaven
oh this brings me back to that one time i was staying back to work on my digital design work. the rest of the campus was very dark because lights were off. when i wanted to go to the shitter, i accidentally walked into the boys bathroom.
I have yet only been in one men's room since our bathrooms are mostly gender neutral except at big places (I live in Sweden) but it was heaven to me too. No one else was in there and it was a game convention or something so no one cared that I went in there.
Ew mens bathrooms are not it ü§¢ü§¢ü§¢ (transmasc person)
As mtf I can say the men‚Äôs bathroom is uhhh‚Ä¶ interesting. Smells like piss. Shit on the walls. Penises of sharpie all over. But the conversations are great
As a cis, heterosexual white male, I have strong feelings on this!
My feelings are as follows:
you should be able to use the bathroom you want, comfortably and without fear of anyone harassing you or making you feel unwelcome/uncomfortable.
Except for the first 2 months of 9th Grade, I used the Girl's Bathroom for the entirety of my HS Education, this was thanks to Order 768, Ministry of Education, Year 2017, which allows for trans students rights (Later replaced by Resolution 810 in 2021, which allows for Trans Students to have rights without parental consent), however, the first time I ever went into it, it was beautiful as well! So clean! And the other girls were so friendly about it too, it was generally an amazing and euphoric experience!

It continued being so for the rest of 9th Grade, then in 10th Grade, I was kinda used to it already
Dude that‚Äôs awesome! I worked for my campus services cleaning both men and women bathrooms. I‚Äôm cis, but it does give me this odd euphoria when I get to walk into both without question (with a spray bottle and cloth that is). Is this my nb awakening ü§î
Congrats!

I did not know that was a reaction one could have to the mens room, but congrats!
Aww hopefully you enjoy your pee crusted heaven in peace
so I just had to comment a smirk at this and say ""I guess the grass is always greener on the other side of the fence.""  But yeah in total seriousness, I am super happy for you having that experience, you know minus the getting kicked out part, even if my own brain is going ""It's the men's room... heaven? men's room, heaven... men's room, heaven.... does not compute!!""
It‚Äôs just a bathroom relax.
if you like this, you should go to an old ballpark or sports stadium and check out the ""urinal trough"" lol
Interesting. I don't know what it is about where I live, but I'm a retail manager and have to validate bathroom cleanliness every night I work and the women's washroom is always a fucking massacre. Like, I don't know what they do in there, why they do it or HOW, but GODDAMN.
So, I've since realized I'm non-binary, but for 2 years I identified as ftm trans man. And I'm not in a place in my life where I have the resources to do any kind of gender affirming surgery or HRT. And because of my weight I've always found binders to be difficult to fit right. (Plus I'm not thrilled that I can't sleep in them cause if it were up to me, I'd only ever change my bra after a shower. I hate changing it any other time because *dysphoria*) 
So my only masculine attribute is my hair. 

So I knew I couldn't go into the boys restroom in a high school in Mississippi. 
And I was honestly relieved. which probably should have been my first sign of being nb lol. I dreaded the day I looked so masculine I couldn't pee in peace in a women's restroom. 
I think it's urinals. Cause I'm not *thrilled* to use a women's restroom but I highly appreciate the the sacredness of a stall.
Hey man,glad you enjoyed! next time just say you're a dude most dudes won't question it again. But there still bigots so
I get the same feeling in the ladies except it's clean and smells nice.
He have an all genders bathroom at my work, it's hella nicer than the gendered bathrooms so I always use that one
I'm happy for you! I do NOT miss it.
same thing with me, who knew one could get so excited over a shitter (my personal name for toilets)
One person's heaven is another person's hell lol
Dude what lol
way cleaner than the womens too!!
Ah yes, the fabulous sh!t covered, stinky, pissed on seats are just üëåüèª
That is one INCREDIBLY particular kind of euphoria (at least in my eyes), but hey, congrats!!!!
Sometimes the womens restroom can smell like zombie sex‚Ä¶
I hope you get to a place where you can express yourself more, I want to use the mens restroom but I‚Äôm too scared since I‚Äôm fairly young and I‚Äôm worried some creep might do something
congrats, mens bathrooms are disgusting and funny places, i hope you enjoy your time in them regardless
Glad you're happy with it. More than welcome to take my ticket, I don't think I'll be using it anymore.
The only bathroom i like is my own :o
This brings me joyüòÜ
I remember my first time using the womens Bathroom at an Restaurant, after i set down someone just pulled on that door very aggressivly, paralyzed with fear i was just hoping its over soon cause i still sound like a guy so if i say that its occupied i probably will get kicked out (that atleast was my thinking at the time)
i am scared to go into the womens restroom what if someone judges me, i look like a guy
Yeah I've heard for years from my female friends how much dirtier and grosser female restrooms tend to be. 

Honestly besides some occasional pee on the floor, men's rooms are pretty clean
Yeah. Although I am not out enough to actually go in them in public, I work at a pool and when we clean the locker rooms it is almost night and day between men‚Äôs and woman‚Äôs.
Become an engineer... the women's is spotless in engineering buildings.  Wait, maybe that's not such a good thing.
At my school it was a 50/50, sometimes it was spotless, sometimes dirty, sometimes there was menstruation blood being used as graffiti, but regardless it was very euphoric for me to be in it for the first time in 9th Grade!
I was a janitor at a fitness facility in my teens/early twenties, and I can confirm that women's restrooms are definitely more disgusting than men's rooms. They'd always take twice as long to clean, and for whatever reason, the women at that facility tended to be a bit more loosey goosey with where their various excretions wound up.
The smell‚Ä¶it can be really really really bad‚Ä¶sweaty smelly coochi‚Ä¶eww.  That smell you can almost taste‚Ä¶ü§Æ
Hovering‚Ä¶
Men's restrooms are worse. Guaranteed. Lol women's stereotypes are annoying ""spotless everything!!"" Lol. In all seriousness it really is something. It is so validating
I‚Äôm terrified of the women‚Äôs public restrooms cause I‚Äôve seen puddles of pee it‚Äôs not new to me. I would probably faint if I saw a stall that looked like a crime scene with blood
Some guy, he was like ""you're in the wrong bathroom, can't you see the sign"" and I got scared so I ran out. guess it's not really being kicked out.
Same question.
It really is!! Being that it's my first time something not related to my agab.
For real. Most guys get in and out, never speaking a word or paying any attention.
I never thought I'd write them and thanks!
The bathroom was relatively fancy so the bathroom was bad but not that bad.
It was some old guy. He seemed very weird
And a giant Bronx Cheer to whoever kicked you out.
You shouldn't have to, but next time take a wing man or two.
Really gross tho
Lol indeed
The bathroom wasn't that bad and a lot better than the womens room
Voices suck. No speak only type
I've transitioned (mtf) however do not pass and it's true that walking into the women's room gives me some stomach flutters.  However, once I get into that stall and sit down I always feel much better.  

I've had occasional cis women give me the side eye however have never been challenged.  I think if you just keep your head down and 'stick to business' you'll typically be fine.  If someone ever challenges you, just stick with 'I'm in the correct room' and tell them to mind their own business.
It can be nerve-wracking the first few times. I was always afraid I'd get yelled at or one of those gun-toting bathroom warriors would storm in there to protect the womenfolk, but so far I've just been some woman taking a pee, just like anyone else there. When you decide to go for it, be safe above all else and maybe go in with a cis female friend at first. If you're afraid of being judged or yelled at (or worse) maybe hold off until you feel you're ready. I wish you luck!
I'm exactly the same but bc I'm still in school, it means I have to go to the toilet in school and bc they r cubicals I accidentally went in the girl 1, wow I felt so amazing yk
U should just do it and if anyone asks just death stare them and say ""I'm a women, or or girl whichever"" and then walk out or do whatever n ye that's what I'd do if I were on a school trip in a theatre or something
I have not found this to be true at all. Maybe it's a geographic thing? I'm midwestern US and men's restrooms are /filthy/.
If I had to guess 'men's rooms' have less general upkeep as most dudes won't care and 'women's rooms' have more upkeep but are more likely to have someone do something outlandishly slobbish like having tiny pieces of tp all over the place for no apparent reason.

'Dudes' spend less overall time in there and do 'the business' then leave.
Just what the fuck is going on in women's restrooms if THAT is clean?
oh damn you are lucky

let me give you an example to what happened when i went in there

vandalism, toilets were stolen lol or destroyed most of the time
>sometimes there was menstruation blood being used as graffiti

wut
Hey, funnily enough, I'm in yr 9 rn and I went in the girls toilet for the first time. Wow it felt so euphoric.
I've cleaned both before. Men's restrooms tend to be worse, but they're bad in a very particular way (pee on toilets and floor). Women's restrooms tend to be cleaner, but when they're bad, they're *bad*. Piss on the toilet seat and floor from squatters, period products everywhere but the trash can, the occasional loose diaper or shit smear from someone who came in to use the baby changing station... It's awful.
Nah women‚Äòs are worse. I‚Äòve cleaned both before as well as used both quite a bit.

‚ÄöSuperficially‚Äò mens are worse if not cleaned regularly cause they‚Äôll be full of piss.
However womens come close second in piss due to all the hovering and spraying everywhere.

However I‚Äôve only had other bodily fluids in the women bathroom. Female hygiene products stuck the walls? Diarrhea thrown at the ceiling.
I‚Äôve never seen anything even remotely similar to that in the women‚Äôs restroom, but anyways üòÖüòÖüòÖ
I work as a cleaner for a business I will not discuss the dealings of just in case, I've seen a lot on the womens bathroom floor and blood is not one of them
>""you're in the wrong bathroom, can't you see the sign""

That seems rather mean. I'm sorry you had to experience that.
I just hope you're not planning on using the men's room at school because those are hell.
If you're going to a gas station, expect it to look like shit TBH, I've seen quite a few good ones around here in the Midwest
PSA if you use * instead of / reddit will display the wrapped text as *italics*
I discovered this when traveling, but some places it's super not okay to flush tp down the toilet because it clogs the sewage systems, and it's customary to place the tp in bins next to the toilet instead. People will leave it on the floor if they can't find a bin.
Thats crazy

You gotta go to some really rundown areas normally to see that kinda thing

I've been going into the men's room for 30 something years and I've only seen what you described a handful of times
Don't ask how, but somehow they used it to paint the bathrooms, disgusting honestly. Luckily my first use of the girl's bathroom was not on one such occasion, I had the bad fortune several times to find that situation in the future across my HS Education tho
Nice! Was it a one time thing or is it permanent?
I did once. There are some nasty ass people out there.
I have. In a single-stall women‚Äôs room. I noped right outta there.
I have on multiple occasions unfortunately lol, it‚Äôs about as awful as it sounds. Also pee being all over the toilet seat, super gross.
Let's hope next time I pass
 why do I want tho
I know.

The / is more emphatic in my mind.
i was talking about one in my school
‚ÄúNoped out of there‚Äù‚Ä¶.üòÜ

I got kicked out of the bathroom!	"So I was out with my family (whom I haven't officially come out to) and I really had to go to the bathroom. So because I'm not out I go to the lady's bathroom. I don't look like a stereotypical girl (I wore a hoodie and shorts, and I have short hair) so as soon as I went in there a person just looked me up and down and said ""This is the womens bathroom"". 

I did not have a good response so I just walked out and went into the disabled toilet because i did not know what else to do. Then for the rest of the day I was so scared to bump into that woman.

(Just to clearify, I am transmasc)"	"Congrats on the accidental passing. xD  

Don‚Äòt be too nervous. People choose the wrong door all the time. Or look gnc. She would be the creep if she made a big deal out of it either way.
Ok if I (as a mtf) would go into the men's bathroom and someone would tell me to get out i would probably just die of euphoria in the moment XD
Nice! Unfortunately I'm masc presenting so people just assume I'm a dude. If I used the mens toilets and got told it was the wrong one I would die of euphoria lol, although I just stick to disabled/unisex/gender neutral toilets if I can
Had the same thing happen to me last summer, it was pretty great. Was wearing a pink blouse and short shorts, but was using the bathroom at a public pool in my small hometown.

I still considered myself visibly trans even if I was dressed feminine, so I just went into the men‚Äôs room to avoid confrontation. 

As I‚Äôm washing my hands this ten year old comes in.

Him: (pauses and looks at me)‚Ä¶this is the men‚Äôs washroom.

Me: (pretending to be surprised) ‚Ä¶ oh!‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶ I didn‚Äôt realize. 

Him: (looking confused but smiling, points back out the door) ‚Ä¶there‚Äôs a signs on the door! The girls bathroom is the one next to this one.

Me: Thank you! I‚Äôll be sure to use that one next time.

Hella affirming. Haven‚Äôt tried to use a men‚Äôs room ever since.
Hell yeah my guy! I had a similar experience once. I am a MTF, and I work as Maintenance for Walmart (fancy word for Janitor) and I was waiting for the men's room to empty out so I could close it down and clean it when a guy customer walked by, looked at me, then walked into the women's room only to come right back out and say ""Wrong bathroom""
This happened to my gf too! She was about to go into the men's bathroom (wasn't dressed fem) and this guy at the restaurants reception was like ""No! Don't go in there, ladies bathroom is over there!"" He looked so happy to be ""saving my gf from embarrassment"" or something that my gf just nodded and went into the ladies.
This happened to me too except I argued with them because I really needed to piss before my math test üíÄüò≠ suffering from success
Before I was out to myself and was binding I got kicked out of the women's bathroom at a restaurant in NH. They forced me to show them my ID and it was awkward AF but now I see it as a foreshadowing.
Confidence. Confidence in who you are. Don‚Äôt second guess while you‚Äôre face to face with someone. Look them in the eye and tell them to mind their on fukn business.
People suck, but sometime they suck in a way that brings euphoria lol
i mean i am a trans masc and use the mens bathroom and i got yelled at and still took a shit because i told him i was trans and the guy just kept looking at me the WHOLE time.
Mtf and early in my transition went to use the toilet at this large market place after having lunch. Went to enter the men's room and a man coming out blocked the entry and said ""You can't come in here, this is the men's room"" and pointed towards the women's. A man behind him nodded. 
I panicked and left and found someplace else that was deserted. 
But I haven't looked back since; it's women's all the time.
Dj calin suffering from  success
That happens to me a lot at school. I usually only go into the girls bathroom to vape tbh but sometimes the boys is locked and say i need water for ramen or something. I have been yelled at and even slapped. It hurts but also makes me irrationally euphoric
""Oh thank god, when I saw your face I thought I was in the mens room!"" would have been a great comeback.
Once I subconsciously walked into the mens bathroom when I was still an egg. It was funny
Why not just go to the men's bathroom?
I haven't had someone ask me to leave but I have seen people thinking about it. Like staring intently or leaving when I walk up to get in line or to use a sink.
:D  
I wish I could get kicked out of men's bathroom, prob not gonna cus androgyny is strong with this one, unless I wear a mask
My mind would break after hearing that. To many madness going on.
Congratulations! lmao accidental passing is truly something else

Tbh this is why I hate public restrooms in general. I don't really feel comfortable in the men's restroom because if I'm not in like, really masc looking streetwear/athletic clothes, I'm not always certain that I pass. But I also hate using the women's restroom because it's 1) invalidating 2) kind of weird feeling 3) a problem if I run into any random acquaintances who know for certain that at the very least I'm a he/him pronoun user.

I've actually gotten both ""This is the men's restroom"" (to which I just smiled politely and said ""I know""...) and ""This is the women's restroom"" (to which I said nothing, because despite being a tiny little twink my voice is really low...) LMAO guess I'm just not allowed to pee :'3
why are people so adamant about who's allowed in which bathroom...
I've never talked to anyone in a toilet, don't talk to me I'm doing my business please don't look at me, don't aknowledge my presence.
if it was me then i would have said ‚Äúyeah, and i gotta pee‚Äù and proceeded into the restroom.
yo, a similar thing happened to me! i was just about to head into a wal-mart bathroom (womens, im also transmasc) when an employee stopped me and said ""this is the women's bathroom, the men's one is over there"" and pointed to it. now i have a very low confidence for passing, especially since im with my dad who loves to point out how feminine and girly i look, so i had no idea this was gonna happen. but i still didn't feel comfortable going into the mens bathroom (i tried awhile ago, i got harassed for not passing), so i kinda just looked at her awkwardly and was like ""uhh..."" and she corrected herself by saying ""oh, im sorry! from back there you looked like a nice young man!"" and i said ""oh haha, that's alright! ive gotten that before, i try to look more androgynous anyways so that's a compliment :)"" and it was just a nice interaction overall. I didn't really mind the women's bathroom because im nonbinary if if there are no gender neutral bathrooms, id rather pick women's for a number of reasons but still. hooray for passing in public!!
Very happy that this turned out well for you! I can imagine I'd get a similar kick from it.

I do, however, think this other person is an asshole and should focus on leaving people alone when they're in the bathroom regardless of appearance.
Not if your mind isn't that way. We are our minds more than our bodies
When I saw the title, I was like ""Oh god,"" because... well getting told to leave the restroom is a common occurrence for trans people, but not normally in a good way like this.

So happy you had this experience!
I'm lucky enough that even I thought I was cis people have done double takes looking at me washing my hands when they see me in the men's bathroom.
Congrats dude! if it helps, Instead of having to go to the women‚Äôs bathroom you can just say you don‚Äôt want to make people uncomfortable and use the men‚Äôs bathroom. I‚Äôm not out and i also look masc so when I do this and no one questions it.
Congratulations
I saw the title and was gonna have a conniption but this is actually kinda nice.
why is that a bad thing...
[removed]
Tgats lowkey kinda awkard but really funny
I wish ppl would accidentally see me as a guy, lmao i was refered to asva gyt by a bunch of little girls i saw at a house party one time then we went onto the beach and i was swimming in a swim vest and bort shorts (aka trunks) and lile the shirt hugs my chest a bit so i guess they jdut thought i was a boy eith man boobs????(im a bit on the larger side btw so its quite possible they jsut thiught i had fat pecks????)
You had me in the first half , I won't lie
thank you :)
Yeah, that is kinda what happened lol :)
That happened to me once when I was boymoding for safety reasons and it honestly made me so happy.
This happened to m(tf)e while I was working. I'm a postal delivery person. I needed the loo. I'm pre everything so have just assumed I don't pass and use the male toilets. However my nails are painted red most days and I have a fringe. An old guy comes in sees me washing my hands and just freezes and apologies. Looks at me looks at the urinals. I giggle and leave he I assume takes a leak haha.
Lol I think the other guy saying that would just think you have a humiliation kink.
The gender neutral bathroom is a rare gem that makes me so happy
children are always the best, even if this child was wrong and it was the opposite situation that's so pure
Oh bless him! He was so kind and polite, too! ü•∞üôèüíú
And after that I would say, ""so my dinner is on the house, right?""
It's wrong
It's not, the post is labeled celebratory.
Shut fuck up, is nothing in this world believable to you asshat? They literally said one person said one simplistic realistic thing, and you say ""hE hARr fAkE!!!!!"" Go fuck yourself let people be happy.
I've had not exactly this happen, but I (mtf/genderfluid) was using the men's room and I went to wash my hands and a guy came in, saw me, froze, and went ""Oh, sorry, wrong bathroom."" I just said ""No, you're in the right one."" And left. ü§£
yay
I agree. It would be nice for the [Stalled!](https://www.stalled.online/) bathroom project to start being implemented.
Remind me of a thing but not really a cool things that happened to me, I'm a trans woman and i was going back home (i was at a friend house) i was wearing a dress. I passed near a kid who was with his mom and he looked at me confused. After he was a bit further he said to his mom: ""this girl was looking a bit like a men"" and her mom just replied: ""oh okay"" and they continued walking... Thanks for the dysphoria kid...

Ever since I'm always wearing a mask when I'm in public...

What am I supposed to say to my kids when they see a congressman in their bathroom?!?!		"Tell them to run lol
And there's wayyyy more trans people.
Lemme quickly add this to my lists of things to transphobs, thanks.üòÅ
you know, I think congressmen are just a lil confused, there suppose to be governors, not fat cats getting paid to keep people oppressed.

they should try to be trans people, now those are people with real morals and are damn gorgeous! (yes I'm looking at you person reading this, I'm staring into your deep beautiful eyes and I must say, you forgot to do the dishes again, but its okay, your too amazing)
Pepper spray, alot of it.
Run.
correct me if I'm wrong, but it's three republican congressmen convicted, and zero trans people, right?
...interesting...
Run like your life depends on it
I actually would
I'm not even trans but I'll take the complimentüòö

Also, the whole point of congressmen is to make bank while keeping the proletariat oppressed and divided so we can't organize against them. Or something like that idk
No... there's gotta be at least 1 trans person, there's no way a group of people would make an already marginalized and abused group seem like really evil people without at least the tiniest piece of evidence. Something like that would never happen
I'm looking around, and so far can find one instance in 2017, but that was in a private bathroom in someone's home. Not public.
Mysterious that their ‚Äúevidence‚Äù is simply the only reason for which they would consider ‚Äúidentifying‚Äù as trans.
When you look at that case, it fits the profile of most assaults on children. The parents left their child with a family friend that the child trusted. And as you said, the assault occurred in the family home.
Huh... so... what you're saying... is that... if they were trans they would go and r*pe people?

Edit: I meant that to be like, they wanna r*pe people but just don't have anything to ""blame"" it on and they think that if they were trans it would be way easier for them to do so
I wouldn‚Äôt put it past many of them to at least harass people if they were trans... oh, wait. They already do that.  It‚Äôs almost as if trans people aren‚Äôt the problem. 

Upon further evaluation, I see you were probably being sarcastic."	mhbgx5	trans	1239	1.0	2021-03-31 17:43:47
I can't believe it (mtf 16, hrt since 15)	"I went to the bathroom at school and there were these girls standing there, and they were like ""oh my god youre so incredibly pretty, youre like a goddess."" And I'm almost certain they had no clue I was trans.

I'm so happy and relieved!!
I just had to share"	"Enjoy the euphoria :)

Idk my Country is pretty shitty with trans laws and school. The only Real explanation i got was when i was in a conversation with my teacher and he mentioned ""well you know... because...(while gesturing at me)""
And that was about the end of the conversation there because i didn't really want to talk anymore. So now i am always supposed to go while classes are going on so that i don't meet anyone in the baths. Luckily i almost never have to go to the baths so it's ok i guess
Hey I mean, that place is like a whole different country compared to the US.
‚ÄúWhat country?‚Äù ‚ÄúFlorida‚Äù lovely /t
welp i‚Äôm sorry to inform you but you have a severe case of the pretties and you are indeed pretty :T lol. don‚Äôt worry girl, you are doing great, good luck with life and everything :)"	s8mrne	trans	1232	0.99	2022-01-20 16:25:41
Coming Out and Cutting Off	"On January 23rd, 2022, I came out to my parents. I had written them a letter a couple of weeks beforehand and put it in my room. I told my mother where to find it. I was at a friend's apartment, near my college.

I didn't speak to her for about another week. The first person I spoke to was my Grandmother, who lives with my parents. She wasn't happy. Neither was my Dad. There was a lot of yelling, a lot of anger, and a lot of pain that day, while I attempted to explain everything to them calmly. I've never been one to get angry.

The days went by, and things slowly calmed down. My Grandma, who had said she didn't want to talk anymore, began to call every day again (multiple times daily), and my Dad called occasionally. I even spoke to my Aunt, who wanted to be the ""mediator"" between me and my Mom.

And then. They asked me to go home. And I agreed.

I was treated with the worst weekend of my entire life.

&#x200B;

The ride home with my Mom was painful. We argued for a bit, invalidating my gender, saying she'd only ever love \*dead name\*. We ate and continued to argue. I never raised my voice. I wasn't raised to do that. The rest of the ride home was silent. I never looked at my phone, I just looked forward as the time ticked down. I didn't rest my eyes, nor did I ask to go to the bathroom despite my bladder screaming at me. I didn't want her berating me for not feeling up to go into the Women's restroom yet.

When we got home, I brought my stuff up to my room. My Grandma had asked to see my HRT, so I took 1 of both pills I take to her. My Mom found the rest and took it, calling me a liar and receptor for even trying to keep it. I went to bed shortly after.

When I got up, my Grandpa wanted to take me to his priest. It wasn't the worst experience in the world, he didn't yell, say I was going to hell, or even say it was a sin. He wanted to ""guide"" me through this. We ate, got home, and then, it was my Dad's turn.

He took me to my Grandfather and Uncle's graves. Both died before I was born. He told me about how proud his Grandfather was of him getting married, and how wanted to feel the same for me. I said he could. He said it wouldn't be the same. He said he wanted to continue his family's name and legacy. I said I could, with adoption. He said it wouldn't be the same. He then took me to see my Grandma. He hadn't told her and left it up to me. I didn't say anything.

We got home. My mom made dinner, and we ate. Afterward, my Grandma encouraged me to speak with my Mo, or she wouldn't speak to me. I wanted to keep her, so I did. It quickly went awry. She took my phone and began reading chat logs, seeing how I spoke to people, now my friends, at my college's PRIDE club. She had already thought I was brainwashed, and this cemented it in her mind. I knew I was trans before I met them, however.

My mom and dad began reacting horribly. They wanted legal action done against my friends, the club, the school, Plume (where I get my HRT). They threatened to get my close friend expelled and fired. Thye began posting things online calling them cultists indoctrinating their child and ""warning"" parents of the threat. My dad sent emails to the heads of the PRIDE club, threatening them if they ever spoke to me again.

My dad threatened to beat me. He said he didn't know if he'd be able to stop himself from killing me if he started.

Both wanted to attack any of my friends if they saw them.

and...

&#x200B;

My dad threatened to shoot my close friend.

&#x200B;

They continued reading chat messages. They were now getting to my high school friends, who I had come out to and who supported me. They started to insult and threaten them too.

My mom began to threaten not to take me back to my dorm. To not let me go back to classes. I had to say things I didn't mean in order to convince her to let me get out of that house.

I went to bed. My dad later told me that as he continued to read my messages, (which he now had access to on his computer because he asked for my Discord password) he wanted to enter my room and beat me while I was asleep.

When I finally got back to campus, my Mom forced me to take my box of feminine items in my dorm down to their car. And then, they left.

&#x200B;

It took me a while to respond to any of my friends. They were incredibly worried about me. I told them I was doing okay, and about everything that had occurred. 

I began formulating a plan of what to do.

My friends had already reported my dad to campus safety. The things I told them were just the icing on the cake.

They got me a prepaid phone. The one I had had Life360 on it, and I wasn't sure how much else they had access to.

I informed my Calculus professor, whose class I had an exam in on the day I planned to confront them. He allowed me to delay it.

I spoke to campus officers, lawyers, to about everyone I could without my parents knowing. They were watching me like a hawk, unfortunately.

During this time, my parents drained my bank account, which was jointly owned. They also informed me that they knew I had another prescription for my HRT filled, and they would be forcing me to pick it up and give it to them.

The plan was for me to confront them. A parent's weekend was coming up, wonderful timing. My friends notified the school of my plan. They would be prepared in case anything happened.

And the day came.

&#x200B;

I got up early, and got ready, watching Life360 as my parents drive down. Luckily, it went both ways. We met up briefly before classes began. I told them I loved them.

When classes were over, I went to our Student Union. Many people, students parents, faculty, security would be there. I'd be safe. My parents came to meet me.

I gave them an ultimatum. They either accept me, give me back my money, stop threatening me and my friends, or I cut them off. My mother gave me a counter ultimatum. There was one option in both that matched.

We continued to argue. I told them I didn't deserve the things they did. They said they had the right to do them. She asked for ""her"" phone. I handed it right to her. She said I was her son. I told her I was her daughter. She walked away.

My dad continued to speak with me for a bit. He said he didn't agree with her taking my phone, and that he didn't ""mean"" any of the threats he made. He was just angry. He asked me if visiting his father and brother's graves meant nothing to me. I said it did, but it didn't change who I was. I hugged him, and he left after my mother.

It has since been a day. I was able to spend the rest of that day with my friends, dressing up how I want, getting my HRT back, changing my passwords to accounts they had, and watching Queer Eye. I had never actually watched it before. It was nice.

&#x200B;

The strange thing is, I feel as though I should have a sense of grief. I will miss my family, I will miss my Grandma, and I will miss my Niece and Nephew. But I think I already accepted losing them as a possibility before I even came out. So, I expected it, and it's what I got. I already went through my grief.

From now on, my life will be harder. I won't be supported by my family, I will have to do my own financial aid for college, I will have to do everything on my own. And maybe I am not ready for it. But I will try. I will be the person my parents thought I couldn't be. I will go through life as myself, unapologetically. Because I have spent the past 18 years incapable of doing so, suppressing myself and my emotions, being the perfect little child, who does no wrong.

&#x200B;

My life will be harder. But it also shines so much brighter. And I cannot wait to keep living it."	"This sounds like an absolute horror show. Your parents could and should be charged for stealing your medication and for making threats of violence. I hope you are well.
It took a ton of strength to make those steps and you were right to defend yourself!
Thank you so much for posting this, and you know we are here for you. Reading this was almost therapeutic for me, as I can relate to most everything and it shows that even if everything goes wrong, its still possible to make it.
I realized my identity just over a month ago, at the end of my first semester in college. I realize my suppression had been preventing me from really connecting with people, and im still trying to figure out how to get friends who would accept me if I came out to them.
This kind of confrontation takes the strength that not many have. I am happy that you are currently safe, and I wish you luck on your journey. This story is the biggest thing I am personally afraid of happening and that is why I am waiting till I graduate. Hiding it is tough, but it is even more badass to live your life as yourself. When it comes to providing for yourself, depending on your major you could look around for some entry internships. Or look into possible scholarships to apply for. Depending on how high your tuition is will change the difficulty of the whole process. If you have more internships than is necessary for your tuition and any other administrative expenses you will get that money refunded to you. Good luck girl, we are all cheering for you.
Did they ever return the money they stole?
It's amazing how mature of a person you are! I wouldn't be so delicated as you were, personally.
They don't deserve you, they sound like disgusting human being frankly, and long term you will be better of without them. You are string, doing this. Be proud
Proud of you, keep it up üíú
Am I the only one who thinks you should run to the cops and tell them your parents threatened your friends life just because you're trans?
You are so brave.
I'm a stranger and this shouldn't mean anything to you
but I am proud of you for stepping up to your parents.

I wish you all the best and joy with your new won freedom:)
Resonated with a lot in your story. Shit birth family here as well. Stay strong! Remember you can make your family however you want! It doesn‚Äôt have to be your blood!
Exactly what I‚Äôm a afraid of when I go off to college and begin to transition.

Honestly you are so brave and you did the right thing by cutting out your family; if they want you back in their then they need to realize they have to make peace with who you are.

Good luck your are braver than I good lady.
Walk your own path, make your own family   


I don't have supportive family, me and my mum pretty much openly hate each other - unless someone is around then she tries to play nice ofc.  
Rest of family is abroad and I have no contact with them, I came out to them though.  
They don't understand it or accept it, but they do want me to be happy - therefore I told them one thing I must do is cut myself from the past, because I won't be able to heal from trauma.

I need love and support, I only started HRT lately and I just have a mindset of a teenage girl, who is beyond her wisdom for her age.

The way I counterpart loneliness and trauma from not so great family is building my own circle of friends, who treat me with respect for who I am.  
When I am surrounded by such people, I am able to be honest, emotional, more loving and I will grow as a person, that I am transitioning to.
I get the feelings what they did should be labeled abuse. None of that was ok, by any metric.
We cannot choose our gender or who we love, but we CAN choose who we call our ""family"". For some of us this is easier said than done, but Im glad you found the support and strength to be true to who you are.

Also, on a brighter note, Queer Eye is an excellent pick-me-up for any occasion.
Yeah. This is why I sent my parents a letter and then just never talked to them again.
I'm so incredibly sorry for you. And I know that this might happen to me too. So I'm cutting them off emotionally at the moment to feel stronger when that happens.
Thanks for sharing. I'm expecting the same of my parents in about a month, so your experience really hits home. You are better off and you have a bright future ahead of you. The best thing to do is to continue to be and become who you were meant to be. Get into a field that you love and live a life worth envying. It's their loss that they chose not to be part of that.

Lots of love sis. You are so awesome. <3
Dear god, I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through all that. I don‚Äôt know if I would have had the resilience you did. Stay strong girl, you‚Äôve gotten this far, nothing can stop you now.
Your parents sound like they would be great friends with mine. I was cut off last summer, tried to let my mom back in a few months ago, and ultimately went no contact. 

Mine didn‚Äôt have as much access to abuse me as yours did. I came out as a married adult, post college. But they still paid for my phone service. They got rid of that eight months ago. I still don‚Äôt have cell service. 

It‚Äôs hard, but I resonate with you saying you already mourned them, in a sense. 

Much love to you girl, you have a fantastic life ahead of you.
You seem like an amazingly composed and compassionate person. I wish I could give you a round of applause and a massive hug at the same time. Whoever you choose to be your friends and family from now on are so lucky to have you!
This is why Im not planning to have any discussion with my family Once I transit, I will just cut them of. Its better that way. Im sorry OP for what happened to you. Also you was very brave.
This post is written like someone is dissociating while writing it. That kind of experience is extremely traumatizing. I hope you‚Äôre okay. Please talk to a therapist as soon as you can. Your campus should have services available.
I'm proud of you. Abusive parents suck and you did the right thing here. Never go back, you worked hard to get here, to a place where you can be yourself.
That sounds like an absolute shitshow, i'm really sorry you had to go through that ‚òπÔ∏è but you have friends and an environment that loves and accepts you so that's a major plus. And you have us as well üòä stay strong girl, and stay safe
I'm sorry these awful ideas got into your family's head. The things people will do when they're scared or angry, over something that doesn't warrant it. I don't know how you kept your cool. That must have been so hard. 

I hope you make out okay, I'll be thinking about you Sister. They didn't give you a choice, you tried.
this is horrifying but I'm so glad you're safe now. you're an incredibly strong young woman, you should be proud for coming out and proud for standing up against them. with support from people who actually accept you you'll grow even stronger and more wonderful. never forget that, never deny who you are
I am so sorry for all that you have had to go through and in the end all of this will make you stronger and now you can truly be your happy self the way you feel and the way you are.
As I was reading this I swear I had hand tremors from trying not to punch these parents ngl.
I know how you're feeling. I've definitely been in a very similar situation a long time ago and those very same events I've never forgotten. 10 years later on down the line with years hrt and many years of effort and dedication and I pass really well, I don't live in a dangerous environment anymore. I have so many friends willing to put others before themselves in this community. It did get easier and I hope that it does for you. The only advice I can really think of right now is to make things as easy as possible for yourself in future by having backup plans and backup plans for those backup plans because people who don't understand tend to find ways to hurt us / upend those plans sometimes without even meaning to.
For one, this is triggering, bot just ""possibly triggering"" seccond, why did you just like.. let your family take all of your stuff? From what i hear you are a grown woman in college so you shouldn't have any incentive to stay or to let them go through your private stuff on your phone or give your dad your discord password, third, IF YOUR DAD IS THREATENING TO KILL YOU AND YOUR FRIENDS THEN CALL THE FUCKING POLICE!! Like what??
You are one of the strongest people, I wish I could hug you. *Hugs*
There is you and there is the *idea* of you. You are the former; your parents ‚Äúloved‚Äù the latter.
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through this sweetie! I have difficult parents but nothing like this. Not even close. I just want to say how strong and brave you are little flower, and that while it is sad, you have a truly shining path ahead to realize your full potential as the beautiful woman you are. Much love from a fellow trans sister ‚ù§Ô∏è
Some people are horrible people. No one should have to experience what you just did. 

As I am also a parent, were one of my kids to leave me a letter‚Ä¶ I would honestly feel bad for not making them feel safe to tell me in person. In person because I would want to hug them, tell them I loved them‚Ä¶ right there,  right then. Let them know I would fight for them. 

Those people don‚Äôt deserve any more of your time. 

Small piece of advice just in case‚Ä¶

Take what you‚Äôve written here. Add to it, add details, who was present what approximate time things happened‚Ä¶ get and include case number from campus security. Get info for everyone you talked to. make sure you can tell the entire story. Because you may need to take legal action (saw that you were waiting for that ‚Äòone more thing‚Äô these people sound quite capable of continuing.
<hugs> ‚ù§Ô∏è
I'm sorry for your family of violent criminals. I hope they get what they deserve if you wish to report them and I'm sure your friends will be there to support you I stead of your family.
Don't feel sorry for leaving them, the things they've done to you could get you into jail in my country.
You are so brave and such a beautiful person. Sending you some üíï
As someone who also has unsupportive parents, and is going off to college in a year or so, this is heartbreaking to read. Scary, even. But seeing someone show so much bravery and stand up for herself in this way is so so powerful and im glad I took the time to read it. You are so strong, and I am sending you all the well wishes and good luck that I can. You're strong, beautiful, and we're all cheering you on!!
Welcome to your newfound freedom. I've been there before, and trust me: none of the upcoming challenges compare to the crippling weight of abusive parents. You'll be okay. You've got this.
Jesus Christ what a shit show. I'm 45 and horrified at this story. Life will be hard but way better than what they did to you. You are obviously a strong woman and many people including me couldn't have handled that as well as you did. Maybe one day they'll come around but it will be on your terms if you want to forgive them (you don't have to)you go girl!!! Also you should sue them for the trauma they caused
It‚Äôs been a pleasure getting to know you and watch you grow, and I‚Äôm so proud! - Max
You're a strong woman, you know that right? Not everyone could stand their ground like that in such a situation, yet you did, as you said life will be hard now, but finally you can start living it as yourself, much love!
Whew that sucks. But also, you sound like an absolute badass. I cannot imagine the strength it must have taken to go through all of this. That you still retain a positive outlook is amazing. Keep spinning, girl.

(Also, if you haven't watched it yet, I recommend seeing the Matrix).
I am very proud of you for standing up to yourself and basically everyone involved in helping you out! You all did great in such a stressful situation!
You're amazing. Always remember that the authentic you will always handle any situation better than the fake you they want you to be ever would.
Ngl, I think you should throw the book at them. This barbaric behavior needs to start hurting these people.
Yeah okay your family fucking sucks, I'm your new mom or dad or whatever the fuck you need lol you are an amazing human being and you are a valid trans person! Now go have a great rest of your day, you incredible young lassie and always know that this community (and I) will be here for you whenever you need!!
It does get brighter! I‚Äôm worse off financially, too, but I‚Äôve been doing much better mentally/emotionally and it gets better! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You are going to do great. Keep that determination and remember most of the people you find and bring close will have your back more than family ever does. ""The blood of the covenant is thicker than the water of the womb""
wow... just wow. I'm so heartbroken for reading all of that. I want you to know that you have all of my support, love, affection and time if you want to talk anytime, even if you want a new friend. I'm not doing as bad as you but I too am planning to escape from home this september (that's when I will turn 18) and be myself, because at my place my parents think it's a phase and my mother is very strict about how I act when she's not looking.

I am really really REALLY sorry that you had to go through everything I've just read (and more things that you probably didn't write which I respect too) but I know deep inside it will be worth it, I know that you will be able to move forward and be who you aspire to be.

I just would love to hug you right now and to tell you that everything will be okay but as I think that we live quite far from each other I'll just send you this, hope for you to read it and say that I love you, that you're valid and that I'm sending a virtual hug.

Lots of love honey, take amazing care of yourself and stay strong, you're doing great and you will be happy. <3
You did so well! I‚Äôm very proud of you üíúüëç
What a painful experience. Just wish I could hug you. I'm so sorry your family treated you to that abuse.
You are so incredibly strong and brave. I started reading this post and had to put it down several times before I could make it all the way through it. What you went through and what they did and said both infuriated me and made me incredibly sad all at once. I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm glad that you‚Äôre ok though. So your research like you said in response to one of the comments. Do your research and speak with lawyers or councilors, maybe even something like campus police. Find out exactly what your rights are and what they can/cannot do or force you to do. I‚Äôm not sure where you are located but I‚Äôm pretty sure if you‚Äôre 18 then they have no legal bearing over you at all. I‚Äôm not saying press charges or anything either, that‚Äôs something only you can decide on. I am saying though, to know your rights to protect yourself from them trying anything else. Please stay safe. I‚Äôm glad that you have a good supportive group of friends.
Wow thats alot sorry
I'm so sorry you had to go through all that. But I am proud of you for standing up for yourself, impressed with your resourcefulness and happy that you have friends who will support you.
You deserve all the best, and you have the patience of a saint for not getting angry with them.
I wish you the best of luck and happiness, going forward!
Well... I‚Äôm so sorry for youüò≠üò≠üò≠

You can be SUPER SUPER proud of yourselfüíú, for how you‚Äôre dealing with this difficult situation.

Hang in there, things will get better eventually...
Wow. I'm sorry girl. No one should have to deal with that kind of extremely transphobic parents. I thought my parents were acting really bad but here you're coming back from hell.

I understand very much about this kind of grief. After several months of arguing about me being trans, I decided to cut off with mine last week too. I will definitely miss them, especially the ones they were before I came out.

I'm 1000% with you.
I think the most frustrating parts of these stories for me is hearing all the abuse and then ending with ‚Äúthose rascals, I‚Äôm not gonna make them face repercussions for their actions but I‚Äôm not happy with what they‚Äôve done‚Äù. Ik it‚Äôs family and all but people need to understand that things have consequences and legal ramifications, you can‚Äôt withhold someone‚Äôs medication from them legally and threatening someone with physically harm is a serious crime that shouldn‚Äôt be brushed off. I‚Äôm guilty of doing this as well with the whole ‚Äúone more thing, that‚Äôll be my breaking point‚Äù but then things calm down and the next thing doesn‚Äôt quite hit your breaking point so it slides and then accumulates and you end up with an abusive shit show. If my siblings wouldn‚Äôt be split up and sent to equally abusive ‚Äúfathers‚Äù ide have my mother in prison for life with the amount of shit I have on her, so I understand there‚Äôs nuance but op if there isn‚Äôt anything truly stopping you, you should seek legal advice in one way or another or atleast get a restraining order
Damn I just have no word to describe this it just seems so out of this world for parents to act like this i know I shouldn't be saying that but and im sorry for what im about to say but ETF IS WRING WITH ARE THEY FUCKING INSANE ACTING LIKE FUCKING DRAMA QUEEN BITCH WTF . More seriously I hope your doing fine by yourself and now that you're free enjoy your oife and be yourself.
This is one of the only things that I read on the internet that actually gave me goosebumps and made me scared for op.
Omg.
You should not be missing that awful, awful family of yours! Such a horror show...

In fact, your ""parents"" should have been charged with prescription medication theft and child abuse!

Just want to wish you well, sweetie. You're a girl and that's what matters.
I know that they can. I've done a lot of research and stuff into what they could be charged with, and it's a fair amount.

I don't intend to do anything to them at the moment though, unless they force my hand. They could do that by trying to ruin my life more than they have by like suing me, or attempting to take the stuff in my room.

On a more lighthearted note, my friends and I had been talking about what they might be able to take from me if they tried, and I joke they may try to take my fridge they had gotten me.

The two things my Mom said she wanted were my phone and my fridge.

My fucking fridge. Not my $1000 laptop, or my Switch, or anything else I have.

My fridge.

It was so ridiculous that I couldn't help but laugh at it with my friends once it was over.
Thanks!

It hasn't been easy, but I have a lot of very good friends supporting me through this. I really owe it all to them.
Hey! I get that. I really didn't put myself out there for a very long time. My high school friend group is only there because I was friends with one guy since middle school, and then a friend of his came in, and then a friend or two of hers, etc.

I'd suggest seeing if your campus has a PRIDE club of some kind. You can get some great friends thereto are almost certain to accept you for yourself. It can be tough to put yourself out there as your authentic self though, and I get that. My first club meeting, I didn't even say my name, or talk to anyone.

But over time, you may begin to loosen up. Tell them your name, maybe even dress as yourself. The first time I went out in public as myself was with them, to a PRIDE event. It's exciting to be yourself, so, all I can say is to try. Go at your own pace of course, but don't let it go ignored.
Yeah, financial stuff is gonna be a bit hard. Luckily, someone in our group recently went through a tough time with parents, and he's supposedly done a bunch of research into financial aid and stuff, and is willing to help out.

I also intend to look into internships, or at least a job of some kind. While my living expenses for the semester are covered (housing by dorm, and food by meal plan) I still have to worry about paying for HRT and stuff.

Tuition is quite high for my college (50k-ish), though I currently have 2 main scholarships covering like 35k each semester as long as I keep a decent GPA. The rest is a bit of an issue, but I've been researching scholarships, and now especially intend to go into them.
That's possible, but remember what the cops have done in the US. I don't trust the police. A lawsuit is a better option...
They don't have a case to sue you with. They're textbook abusive, breaking several laws, and if you throw the book at them (or vice versa) you are going to win.
Are you a minor? Refuse. If you're a minor get emancipated. This is insane. Stop doing what they say, stop giving them passwords. Go change all your passwords right now. Stop giving them access to anything..just refuse. And do not go back. You need to get help through LGBT groups for young people. Their are groups that help out up to mid 20s.
Ah, yes, the most.... Actually, stealing your fridge would be a pain in the ass for you, I was going to make fun of it but honestly that would be one weird power move
Yeah time for new parents.
Don't sell yourself short - your friends are backing the strength they see in you.

This was a tough read, and you're in a tough situation. 

But you got this. Stay strong...
I'm lucky the college I go to has a PRIDE club...
Make sure you check prices against GoodRX and CostPlus Pharmacy if you're in the US (which is what I'm assuming) because they may help bring the cost of your HRT wayy down.
If you haven't already and you're in the US and 25 or under, talk to your school's financial aid department to start paperwork for financial independence. Just let them know you've been cut off. This will have them reassess your financial obligation and can result in a significant increase in financial aid.

Good luck. It's so hard. I'm so sorry you're dealing with this.
I know in my area they sheltered a trans masc from his family and friends who basically ganged up to kill him over nonsense. It's worth a shot
You're right.
In addition to this great advice‚Ä¶

You can call your HRT provider and ask if they are willing to move you to a more inexpensive option.  Most providers are acutely aware of the challenges that the cost of medications pose to patients, and they know a few tricks."	slqvog	trans	1212	0.99	2022-02-06 07:21:51

Is it actually a trans inclusive bathroom if your restaurant only has a single one-person bathroom with a lock?	A local restaurant was touting their inclusiveness with their gender free toilet.	"As someone who is non-binary, I'd take it over either men's or women's.
It's hard to get more gender neutral than a single toilet with a locking door.
Honestly if they're not gendering it then yeah, it is. A lot of restaurants have 2 gendered single stall bathrooms, which is so much worse when they could just be... not gendered. They have the same shit in them (minus maybe a baby changing station that should be in both bathrooms in the first place). A single stall, non-gendered bathroom actually sounds like a dream tbh
Yes.
It's a restaurant, like that's fairly common, but I've been to a number of restaurants with 2 or 3 single stall bathrooms that are pointlessly gendered.
Yes. This is by far my favorite bathroom situation for a public place to have. Just labelled ‚Äúbathroom‚Äù with no mention of gender so i don‚Äôt have to be reminded of the ‚Äú‚Äùissue‚Äù‚Äù
Hahaha - THE toilet cares not for your gender.
honestly every bathroom should be like a changing room, just several single rooms with the bathroom shit and a lock.
Of course. How would that not be trans inclusive? The only possible next step would be to have a designated trans bathroom and a cis bathroom and that makes no sense whatsoever.
If it‚Äôs a place I‚Äôm not going to be harassed for peeing I call it a win for inclusion in my book üëç
As a cis male who grew up in Europe the weird gappy American stalls are horrifying to me. Single occupancy bathrooms every time thanks!
Yes, yes it is. And the lock is showing they get it.
I mean, by definition it is. I don‚Äôt know how much the restaurant is touting their horn but if it‚Äôs over doing it thats a different problem.
One topic at a time is right! No more gendered bathrooms we need gender neutral pooping stations !
I honestly prefer to have a bathroom like that. As a trans woman who does not pass yet I feel really wildly uncomfortable in either a men‚Äôs or women‚Äôs restroom with other people.
I mean, yeah. Yeah, it is.
Considering they‚Äôll get as much hate as support for doing something like that, I appreciate it. It signals that the restaurant as a whole is likely supportive and safe
I mean it's obviously not intended with trans people in mind but it's inclusive regardless
Yes.  However, bragging about being trana inclusive is usually not because of how moral your business is; its usually just a money grab when they the start talking about how amazing and inclusive they are.

So yes, but that doesn't necessarily mean the company is good.
I went to a CHURCH of all places and they had only gender neutral bathrooms, full restrooms with multiple toilets and urinals but they just had a sign that said ""restroom"", they had one on each floor
I think we should replace the current signage system with a simple plaque on each door saying ""the shittery"" with no allusions to gender.
Is the setup of the restroom something special? No. The sign is, though. It says we value our trans customers more than our transphobic customers.
I have to be honest, I don't get as much flack going into the ladies room when dressed as a man than I do as a woman... just saying.
Bathrooms should just be bathrooms for everyone.  At home you share with your mother/sister/daughter etc. father/brother/son etc.  Suddenly in public spaces that just goes out the window and everybody‚Äôs thinking about each others crotches.
I guess so lmao,
I'd say it is regardless of the original intention when they built the place. 

It sounds like there could be incencerity though if they're aggressively advertising a tiny single occupancy room as gender neutral though. xD
yeah


id say its better than having one with multiple stalls sicne its way safer n stuff
Sometimes, like at many airports, they call it the ""family restroom"" and then they rebrand it all-gender when local politics allow for it.    Idk I appreciate it even if it's a small gesture
I think it counts‚Ä¶ it seems like they are making a point to let their patrons know that non-binary and trans folks are welcome.
The pub that I work at is usually full of older, rough looking blokes and a few women, with smatterings of younger people; at first glance it seems like a proper spit and sawdust pub, but everyone I've met in there is wonderfully inclusive and generally lovely

The toilets, however, are two single stalls, each with a lock, and gendered for men and women respectively. But literally everyone that goes there just says ""I'm using whichever one is open"". Both men and women just roll with it and they may as well be gender neutral. Honestly it's the kind of attitude that makes me feel so safe there and I love it
The most inclusive bathroom scenario is when there is only one option.
Yes.

That's basically the definition of it.
Yes
That‚Äôs the best thing for me personally.
It is inclusive and I‚Äôm all for it. 
In fact I love it. 
:)
So they expended no effort on this one but yes this is technically trans inclusive. I personally am not going to expend one iota of energy being mad at a company tooting their own horn about having a gender neutral bathroom. If they aren't doing anything transphobic, then great. The fact companies now think it's a selling point to be inclusive even if they didn't really have to do much, cool. Goes to show the tide is turning in our favor if including us is something to brag about. And anyway there are way more important things we have to worry about. I don't wanna judge you or anything but this feels kind of like actively trying to find something to be mad about tbh - and I'm the last type of person to say that since I'm a firm believer that microaggressions matter but this isn't even that
uh yea? I would take that over any public bathroom anytime.
Um, yes? That's about as gender neutral as you can be, and I would definitely prefer it over the normal setup. Though there really ought to be two of them if it is at all bigger than a dozen people including staff at one time in there
I love that my local small-town Y has an inclusive change room with nongendered bathrooms inside.  The sign says ""inclusive"" without specifying ""gender-inclusive,"" and the space has a bunch of increased-accessibility features as well. It's large and accommodates several families at a time.  Amazingly for me, groups of teenagers seem to be among the heaviest users, regardless of group composition.  They just seem to like it more, which in my view is totally normalizing an ""everybody just uses this space, what's the problem?"" sort of attitude, which is great.

Though for now I'm still kinda glad there are also gendered change rooms, because the jerks tend to self-select for those and thus I don't need to deal with them.  But hopefully the need to protect the rest of us from them will continue to diminish over time.
It‚Äôs not necessarily ‚Äúinclusive‚Äù in its idea, but in practise yes - it‚Äôs very inclusive and not just for trans people. It prevents ‚Äúbathroom embarrassment‚Äù or interaction autistic, trans and disabled people can‚Äôt stand. It removes the gender fight for NB, unlabelled, questioning, or non conforming people. It allows people with kids or people who need care to use the bathroom privately and without pressure, and it limits bathroom anxiety for a lot of people!
Gendered bathrooms are pointless
I mean, technically, yes. With that setup, it is more or less impossible to exclude anyone.
That's ideal for me. Imo, public bathrooms with multiple stalls in one big room should be done away with. They are only good for enforcing authoritarian gender norms.
Actually in my country, they are not to inclusive with nothing  and it sucks being a non binary person and have the ""woman or men"" only.
Easier than building another toilet I guess
I mean, technically I guess? Lol
You just walk in there and it's a urinal
I mean I prefer to not see people right after I pooped anyways
I see no reason why it wouldn‚Äôt be? But also, it doesn‚Äôt need to go out of its way to be trans inclusive if it‚Äôs trans inclusive by design üòÇ
Eh it‚Äôs marketing which is always a seed of truth under a bunch of crap. Is it a safe bathroom that trans and non-binary people can use without conflict? Awesome, more of that is good. Is it a beacon of inclusivity? No it‚Äôs a building with 1 bathroom and they‚Äôre trying to sell food.
Yes
I'm the manager of a restaurant with a single small non gendered bathroom with a lock. Seeing as how me (trans femme) and one of my employees (trans masc) both use that thang on the reg I'd like to think it's inclusive. Honestly, it's a hell of a lot less stressful than having to worry about using the restroom with others.
I would love that personally.
Well I chose to work at a place just because they had a restroom located in the kitchen.  The corporate place I was at for years wasn‚Äôt designed for workers and management was like ‚Äútake off your chef coat and walk out of the kitchen in front of the entire dining room‚Äù which took 5 mins just getting there, not to mention doing the dirty. I understood that it‚Äôs a cleanliness issue but depending on the weather, personal health and my clothing situation it‚Äôs not always comfortable to be taking off your uniform in front of a full restaurant just to relieve yourself.  also worked at a family owned place back in 2011 and the owner didn‚Äôt care which one I used as long as I came in the morning and kept them clean and cooked the recipes up good.
Sounds like how all that cheap imitation cheese and meat has rebranded as ""vegan"" and is now double the price of the real stuff.
[deleted]
Yes
Figgymint said it best absolutely the best answer
I mean I just hate those public stalls anyway so I‚Äôd say so
yea i‚Äôd say so, i try and use the family bathrooms in public because i‚Äôm usually quick and don‚Äôt feel comfortable choosing a bathroom. As long as there‚Äôs no gender marker i feel like it‚Äôs actually pretty safe using it as a trans person.
I honestly don't give a fuck, if I can make my business there it's fine.
IMO this is a perfect example of gender neutral bathroom.
I wish there were more gender neutral bathrooms. At my school there's only one with two stalls where I always go because I still feel like a creep if I approach the girl's bathroom door and feel like I don't belong in boys bathrooms anymore (especially since I'm full-time now)
All we need is generalised pooping stations, then half our problems are solved
I think it's hard to say the one spot wasn't inclusive in that nobody is special, and everyone has access to it.
Technically yes.
Absolutely. Why wouldn't it be? Anyone can use it and so it is inclusive for everyone.
Sure! I love those bathrooms cuz it takes the worry out for me. Does suck when there is a line for the single bathroom
That's the most inclusive
Yeah?
yeah it is???? like its a bathroom... without gender....
i don't really understand lol. a gender neutral bathroom is a gender neutral bathroom. way better than gendered one imo

it sounds like you're bothered that there isn't more than one stall?
I don‚Äôt see the difference in a bathroom type we all poop the same so why make a big fuss about it right? I have that people get all bend out of shape over this issue and I find most middle age white men figure the trans person to be a Pedophile which that goes to show you how fucking stupid middle aged white men are. Lol I have penis I‚Äôm king lol
*I* don't care about the sign on the bathroom since any bathroom will have what I need.  Some *other* people do.  A great deal.  Which means that I, rather perversely, am forced to care about something that, when you get right down to it, ought to be about as trivial an event as eating.  It isn't as if there are specific men's and women's menus and millenia of social taboo against ordering from the ""wrong"" one after all.
This is how my favorite gay club does it. Though they have like five scattered around the building, one by each bar.
This is why i think there should be two types of bathroom. The pissing and the shitting. Really, does someone go to the bathroom to do something that not these and wash hands? XD but really, one is enough, just people stop bitching about it and everything good
At the university I work at we have full multi occupancy gender neutral bathrooms. It's actually pretty awesome. Everyone just goes about their business like normal
Honestly, God bless restaurants that do this. True allies.
Great answer
This! There‚Äôs a restaurant that I otherwise quite like, and they have 2 bathrooms each with their own door and lock, and they‚Äôre like, ‚Äúbetter put big gender signs on these puppies!‚Äù But why???
In my experience the men's often has a urinal.
Ok sure
Mhm. If I don't have to think about it, it's good.
[deleted]
Oh, it‚Äôs a bakery with good donuts
100% this! I can‚Äôt believe no one brought it up yet (that I saw), but in Sunny in Philly I think they eventually decide to call both bar bathrooms ‚Äúanimal shithouses‚Äù to do away with any gendered distinction on their signage
Sorry, do you mean going to the men‚Äôs dressed as a woman? Or the woman‚Äôs dressed as a woman? 
I‚Äôve never got a reaction either way but I try to be like a ninja so no one sees me.
Oh the building was built before the restaurant
Oh I‚Äôm cool with it, and the place is cool. I just thought it was funny.
A donut bakery
I‚Äôm not bothered
Alcohols. Alcohols are the menu you're looking for.
> It isn't as if there are specific men's and women's menus

Actually ... https://www.theweek.co.uk/news/world-news/954656/restaurants-print-menus-for-women-with-no-prices

(in the US litigation kind of killed that off a couple years ago, but it used to be much more of a thing even here)
The uni I attend has a couple single stall locking bathrooms scattered around campus. I found the one at the end of my first semester. They advertise that they exists but omitted them from all the signage. What you describe sounds much better.
What university is this? I work in higher ed too and have only seen this at Carnegie Mellon. It's pretty rare. Thought it was rad as hell
My highschool has this. It's both great and absolute shit.

Great, cause I don't feel comfortable going to the girls bathroom, and shit cause people use it to vape, make out, pass drugs, and just hang out. It's also the only place irl that I've ever experienced transphobia.

Also it's only one. On the second floor in a four floor school. It can be pretty tedious to get to depending on your class :/
Won‚Äôt somebody think of the children?!
Why'd you ask the question if you were going to give a dismissive answer to one kind of opinion?
Is that sarcastic or agreeable? /gen
I meant if it was out of proportion. It‚Äôs good to be inclusive but it doesn‚Äôt make you a saint, especially if they are having their one bathroom be available for everyone.
Which episode? I want to see this now.
When I go into a ladies room dressed like a man, women tend to think I have a good reason to be there. If I go to a women's room dressed as a woman, they tend to think the worst of me.
I'd legitimately forgotten about just how important the gender and sexual implications of alcoholic beverages were when I was in that fuzzy *approximately* of drinking age window until you brought it up.  It's an excellent point.
Is this actually a thing?
I alway thought it was a 'men order for the women' kind of deal way back when.
See also: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ladies'_night

Still legal in some states, but rare in my experience.
Oh wow I'm sorry about that. When we rolled ours out they just initially transitioned the single occupancy disability washrooms to ""all gender"" washrooms which entailed sticking a sign on it saying so. I'd say that was already obvious though since only one person can go in at a time. xD 

A pretty lame start if I'm honest but now the new buildings have mostly gender neutral full washrooms
It's at the University of British Columbia's Okanagan campus.
I‚Äôm cool with it. Bathrooms are stressful. I just think it was funny of them to say that they made their one toilet trans inclusive.
[deleted]
OOF I‚Äôm really sorry this reply is so late b u t I think it‚Äôs season 13 episode 6, ‚ÄúThe Gang Solves the Bathroom Problem‚Äù

It‚Äôs v goofy/ridiculous/I‚Äôm sure inappropriate in some ways, but idk I love that show & in turn like the episode & feel like it‚Äôs a good satirization of something as trivial as people even caring abt what bathroom others use 

(& while it can probably be expected from Philly, still heads up for some outdated/problematic terms for genderqueer ppl etc from a character who‚Äôs particularly uninformed, just in case that‚Äôs a dealbreaker/a trigger etc <3 )
Do you ask them what they think? Or are in Minnesota or something?
The cis have gendered literally everything from the enjoyment of porn, to what we drink.
Steak for men and salad for women?
I haven't seen it in years in the U.S. but used to see it all the time. Still a thing in Europe.
I‚Äôm trans and my partner uses a wheelchair. We‚Äôve been saying for years that the folks that design these signs think that the genders are m/f/disabled. Running joke.
Well that is great they are ahead of the curve.
Okay? I meant being inclusive to other people does not make you a saint. People should just be inclusive and believing that doing the bare minimum of being inclusive is all you need to do is a bad thing.

And I use saint meaning someone who is looked at as a paragon of morality, not as a christian saint.
Alberta, though I usually do have a good reason to go into the ladies room when dressed as a man.
[deleted]
It's actually generally the way building code is written. They specify m/f/d stalls per occupancy. 

It's why you find things like two single occupancy locking rooms each with a gendered sign instead of two gender neutral rooms. To pass review they need X male and X female rooms, not just X rooms.
[deleted]
I grew up in Alberta! How‚Äôs that place holding up?
First of all, define normal. Second, I'm not a bro.
Did I say I wanted an invitation? I‚Äôm saying that someone shouldn‚Äôt think they are virtuous just because they let people use the bathroom they want. 

I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm saying that makes you think that I expect an invitation. All I‚Äôve said is people doing the bare minimum for inclusion isn‚Äôt a reason for them to pat themselves on the back.
Well, I make more money as a full time student than as an electrician...

It‚Äôs a virtuous thing to do, they could lose business.

gender has nothing to do with sexual preference
You don't even know what you're talking about if you think cis is a sexual preference. XD get your ass out of here"	s9nanu	trans	1110	0.95	2022-01-21 22:49:58
real gender bathroom	"At what point of transition did you start using your real gender bathroom?
I feel so bad going to my fake gender bathroom but I feel like i still have to because i am not yet passable. Sorry that this post doesn't include NB people, yall should have your own bathroom (maybe that would even be a solution for me)"	"When someone told me ‚Äúyou‚Äôre in the girls bathroom!!‚Äù I knew it was time to use the mens bathroom.
im pre-everithing trans man and look quite androgynous, i use both bathrooms and get pushed out of both
I switched as soon as I started t. I had gotten weird looks from women in their room for years, so when I started t I decided that since I was taking that measure to transition I might as well start using the men's room too.
Once you do it for the first time, its easy! No one will probably think twice especially if you have long hair and/or dress fem and vice versa for mens. Who looks at each other in public bathrooms anyway? Just walk in there like you're supposed to be there.
I went to Walmart and a lady started yelling at me when I walked into the women's room. I go to the men's now.
The only good thing about not being able to study right now is the fact that I don't have to worry about bathrooms and classmates.

In malls, ferries and airports I usually switch between the male and female bathroom depending on my mood and if I'm on my period or not. I think I started doing it pretty early? Like maybe even pre-T.
Non passing trans man here, I just hold it in üò´
I was out in feminine clothes lately for the first time with my long hair open and clipped and some ( probably not perfectly realistic but working i think) stuffing in my bra. I don't know how well I passed, noone gendered in and form me outside my friends I was with who I was out to, but it was clear what presentation I was going for.
I was intending to use the women's restroom at the ice cream place and I did but those restrooms had no reason to be gendered at all as it was just 1 seat stall in fully closed walls and doors, so that didn't even feel weird. 
I fully intent to use the women's restroom when I present like that even though I'm nervous and probably will in the beginning bring my AFAB NB friend who is usually read s as a woman when they're available.
While I'm not 100% sure I'm passing in that presentation I cannot possibly use the man's room. Not only if I am passing people will think ( i mean correctly so,) that I'm in the wrong room, that's super incongruent with what i want to be seen as and is even more dysphoric when I'm not boymoding, i also fear more for my safety when encountering transphobic males in the men's room than transphobic female's in the women's room.
As soon as I started using feminine clothes. I just wasn‚Äôt comfortable going in the men's bathroom in a skirt, passing or not
my hair is long and with a mask on i pass 100% so i stopped going to the men‚Äôs restroom at the beginning of the pandemic. but more specifically, i was kicked out of the men‚Äôs restroom TWICE and felt embarrassed for myself and the guys after the second time. 

some girls notice me cuz i‚Äôm taller and probably still a little skiddish but i usually go in-and-out and no one gets hurts type of situation.
I transitioned to the woman's bathroom when I started presenting as woman.
I went in as soon as I came out. But just as a reminder, there is no pass or fail in this department. Cis Women and cis men come in all different shapes and sizes, there is no standards, if your going by looks alone then more than a 1/3, maybe even half of cis people would be barred from their own assigned gendered bathrooms for not looking the masculine or feminine enough. Own what you are, and go where you choose.
I think the correct time to switch is when you feel more uncomfortable in the old bathroom than you are afraid of using the correct one
I think we need to switch to universal bathrooms. I‚Äôve been in one in Europe. Basically there‚Äôs a single communal bank of sinks and all of the bathroom stalls have full coverage doors (that bit‚Äôs kind of important. The communal bathrooms in my college dorm were super awkward when taller guys came in). It solves quite a few issues. There‚Äôs gender inclusivity, there‚Äôs the issue that it takes longer to sit down to pee so there‚Äôs always a massive line at the woman‚Äôs restroom (you could still have urinals in stalls for standing pee-ers). It allows parents to supervise their opposite-sex child who‚Äôs too old to go with them into a gendered bathroom but too young to go alone. It protects people who get bullied for not ‚Äúpassing‚Äù as their gender (which includes a lot of cis-women who get mistaken as guys because they have short hair). I think it would actually lessen assault risks for the hypothetical sex offender guy who hides in women‚Äôs bathrooms because if everyone is using the same bathroom he‚Äôs more likely to get spotted. It gives all people access to baby changing tables and tampon dispensers. Lots of benefits.
I have been on HRT for almost a year and just used a multi-stall women's restroom for the first time about a couple of weeks ago. I'd used single stall women's restrooms before  (what's the point of these being gendered again?) and a multi-stall restroom in a state govt facility (their non-discrimination policies are very strict and the employees aren't afraid to enforce them). I count the most recent as my first real time as my fears are centered around causing both people and employees discomfort. I didn't have any problems, but it's still intimidating for me. 

Usually I just don't use the restroom in public. I schedule my life around businesses that support trans people or have unisex restrooms. If neither of those things exist around my itinerary, I limit my time in public.
The day I had my deed poll completed; by that point I'd already been on hormones for a few months anyway.
I kinda flip flop. If I‚Äôm not wearing my binder, I go to the women‚Äôs (cause I‚Äôm five foot, 160 pounds, I don‚Äôt wanna risk getting hurt by going into the men‚Äôs), and if I‚Äôm binding, I go into the men‚Äôs (cause when I‚Äôm binding, I kinda just look like a young teen, not a 20 year old, so I can pass just fine).
When I started presenting as a woman I used the women's restroom.   I live in Colorado where they had passed a bill the same year I started presenting female that said you can use the restroom you are presenting as.  So I knew I was legally on good footing.  I still don't feel comfortable in naked spaces for women such as women's locker rooms because I don't think I pass.  So at the gym I use the one single occupancy restroom/shower to change.
So I started before hrt but vary rarely as i would only do it if the bathroom was empty or my make up game was on point XD but as soon as covid made masks socially acceptable makeup no makeup its ez. I still get odd looks occasionally but as long as i don't speek im good.  It was funny at a drag event going to the bathroom was like um what's the protocol here XD as people in beautiful dresses were using both LOL same with anime conventions can be a good time to try and explore but also they will be super busy unlike Walmart or something. But once you get through the one awkward chapter in every gender bender manga your self it becomes easier and less stressful.
I‚Äôve been on hrt for 5 months. I‚Äôm not comfortable using either right now. I don‚Äôt casually pass, but people who see me every day are starting to notice me presenting and looking more femme. 

Like if I‚Äôm out on a date with me GF looking super dolled up? I could probably use the women‚Äôs restroom with no issue. But casually at work or running errands? No way.
A woman came into the women's bathroom, looked at me, and asked if she came in the wrong bathroom. I was pre-T a the time, so I never considered that I actually passed enough to use the men's, but apparently I was actively confusing women lmao
I started to when i moved and had been on T for a year but then my work basically outed me to everyone and the state of TN has a bathroom law so i have to use the women's which just makes everyone uncomfortable. 

Like, i dont feel safe in the men's even tho i pass decent enough but i dont think the women feel safe with me in theirs so i just get UTIs all the time bc fuck me i guess
Thankfully my uni has gender-neutral toilets, so I can use those : D in the rare instance I use any other toilets (I live on-campus and barely ever leave lol) I tend to just default to the one that matches my AGAB to avoid conflict :/

Yeah, idk why we have gendered bathrooms. It would save time, space and money; increase privacy and efficiency to just have individual, lockable cubicles (and by cubicles, I mean floor-to-ceiling walls, not the half-wall crap that motorway service stations have) that don‚Äôt have a gender marker on them.
pretty much as soon as a started socially transitioning. before i became ‚Äòpassable‚Äô i got weird looks from people when i‚Äôd go in or leave but never from people inside the mens room
I started using my real gender bathroom  once I started dressing fem.  Anytime I go to a public woman's room, nobody has said anything.  I've actually had friendly chats with some cis women.   I find that cis women where I live are so supportive and nice of Trans women.
I‚Äôd say once you start passing pretty consistently. Even if you don‚Äôt pass 100% of the time, you can get away with it just don‚Äôt draw attention to yourself. In saying that I would go up to 20 hours without using the bathroom just to avoid picking one even though I had been passing for years. It‚Äôs hard to figure out tbh
It will probably vary by place. Use the proper bathroom whenever you feel sufficiently safe in that specific building. Maybe you aren't up for it at Walmart, but that doesn't mean the same has to be true for, say, an LGBT bar, or a business where you feel safe. Picking one building to make the switch at a time can make it feel much less daunting.
pretty recently, I just stopped caring lol
I was at about 4 months of HRT before I switched full time. I went to use the men's restroom in a local mall, but a cleaner stopped me and said ""Ma'am, this is the men's room"" and pointed me towards the women's (I already knew where it was, just didn't have the confidence).

I've only had one person actually say anything to me in the women's, a co-worker I didn't know, actually. As I washed my hands, she was like ""Have you had 'the surgery'?"" I tried to play it off like I had no clue, but she kept going. ""I'm surprised they let people like you use the women's restroom."" Like, damn, I'm just here to pee!

Also, I had a burger joint I'd pickd up some shifts at tell me I wasn't to use the women's restroom because I was ""legally male"". I quit after 4 days, in the middle of shift, fuck them.
Soon as you're presenting as your actual gender. Once I started wearing a skirt publicly I started using the girls washroom. No one ever said anything.
I use an access toilet. Always. Not playing that game. At wlmy new job though they actually created a few designated gender neutral bathrooms when I joined which was really nice.
Hey, I'm a UK, 17 trans mtf pre-hrt college student. I got threatened when I used the males bathroom because I was wearing a dress and make up etc.
I went into the women's and got called a paedo etc...
I reported this to the teachers. Those students were brought to me in a meeting with them.. (kinda intimidating right?!) then the girl said ""its self defense because I'm a guy"". And the boy said ""if you wanna be a sissy or whatever go use girls bathroom, f*****. They said that infront of the teacher and he nodded it off, pretended he didn't hear it, gave me access to the disabled toilets so I don't go in either. Wtf is that logic? Pfft.
As soon as I started presenting feminine, I started using womens bathrooms. I'm clockable and not in my town where everyone pretty much knows me I'm in the biggest city for this week. 

Side eye big time using the woman's today. Whatever I'm woman; just not cis. Full makeup and b cups, to be fair boobs hidden by my jacket, but you can see in my mannerisms that I'm feminine
I'm going to be entirely honest,  I have no intent on going in a men's bathroom if I can avoid it. I'm trans masc, so it gives my dysphoria but I'm fairly androgynous so people don't say anything besides misgendering me and assuming I'm cis. Cleaner woman's bathrooms are the way to go for me
I‚Äôm not passable so I just keep using mens bathroom or a family bathroom.
Many trans women will never be passable as cis women. But if you‚Äôre living as a woman, dressing as a woman, and you are a woman, you should feel comfy to use the woman‚Äôs bathroom. As soon as I started dressing in gender affirming clothes I started using the woman‚Äôs bathroom. I can‚Äôt speak for trans guys tho! 

On a side note: I‚Äôm not passable as cis, but I generally pass as a woman these days, but presumably as a trans woman. It‚Äôs really nice üòå

The only other concern is safety, of course. If this is an issue, then whatever bathroom doesn‚Äôt have men in it is probably safer, but neither will be totally safe
Being genderless, I always found the bathroom thing confusing. Before I realized I was genderless, a lot of gender things were sex things for me. It was easier to go number 1 in a urinal, so I used the men's bathroom. Still do.
I‚Äôm in a public middle school‚Ä¶ And I‚Äôve only been trans for 2-3 months‚Ä¶ So everyone knows‚Ä¶ I‚Äôd also get yelled at my staff‚Ä¶ Because they know too‚Ä¶ That‚Äôs why I wait until I‚Äôm home‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt even go when I‚Äôm in public‚Ä¶ I just wait‚Ä¶ It sucks when I‚Äôm on my period though‚Ä¶
I only used the wrong bathroom once after I transitioned, and after that it was always the women's, and it gets really easy after the first time. Nobody really says anything about it, but if anyone does, just explain yourself
I have had luck to have an accepting school. So I used the girls bathroom about a year or so after starting my social transition
I'm looking very fem that's why when I use to mans bathroom, then they looks like they've seen a ghost. But when I use girls bathroom I feel good and no one looks like they've seen a ghost
I started using the women's restroom as soon as I was presenting and confident enough in my makeup skills. I'm lucky enough to work from home, so I had more control choosing when that happened...beforehand I'd often hold it until I was home.

I also had a pre-loaded response to anyone trying to call me out as being trans or something, ""I'm just a really ugly woman! Fuck off!""
I basically just used family and gender neutral bathrooms. There isnt really a right time. You just have to do it when you feel comfortable. I still get scared that some conservative jerk will try to hurt me but at this point, if i gotta pee i gotta pee.
Imho, all places should have MANY large gender neutral, single occupant, wheelchair-friendly bathrooms. Then transphobes don't have to worry about ANYONE going into the ""wrong bathroom"" for whatever reason.
When I stopped using my dead name. (Lomg before I got it changed or even started  hrt)
I've only had the courage to do it once or twice, only with a dear friend that gave me the confidence boost I needed. I will say, like most things in life confidence/poker face can carry you a far way, as is being brave enough to say ""what, you wanna watch or something? Pervert."" if someone questions it.
So I don't 100% pass and my rule is if I'm dressed fem (which is most of the time now) I use the woman's, and if I'm dressed male I use the men's.

So far I have had no one tell me anything offensive, but have also mainly been in San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Mexico.

Most of the time no one cares, sometimes people look, sometimes people give compliments on my hair/wardrobe.
Started using the mens room when I started my first job I was out at, I‚Äôm still only on the social transition phase. It actually made me feel really good because the first time I went into the mens room the guy that was training me lead me in to show me how to replace the soap dispensers without even hesitating.
Once when I was using the women's bathroom (I'm ftm but still use the women's bathroom most of the time because I don't feel safe in my school) the person cleaning the toilets saw me and scolded me for using it, made me feel pretty good ngl cause I pretty much pass even without testosterone, must be pretty awkward for the girls using the bathroom tho...
Kind of a weird story, but I think some of you might still enjoy to read it. I started when I was 8.

When I (AMAB) was still going through elementary school there were 2 years of very rough bullying, as all the boys made a point of excluding me at every turn, telling me I'm a filthy girl. Some with a more extreme attitude regularly beat me up, and as a disabled kid I was an easy target. I didn't really belong with the girls either, but at least they didn't make my life hell. So it came to be that eventually I started to frequent the girls' bathroom whenever I needed a place to hide. It was a small school, so pretty soon everyone who saw me there knew about my situation and it was never a big deal. It probably also helped that with my disability I was such a slow runner and so easy to topple, I could not have been any less threatening to anyone.


I went back to using the boys' lavatory after changing to a much larger school, to avoid complications. Luckily the bullying stopped with the change of school. (Also, the years of ongoing therapy finally started yielding results, so while I continued to be a pushover, it was less obvious to people, making me less of a target.) 


As a side effect, I never really got used to urinals, and to be honest, I don't see the appeal at all, so I never use them. I also still use the girls' bathroom whenever I'm absolutely certain no one's in there, simply because they tend to be cleaner and it makes me feel a bit like a gal, something that I came to enjoy way more than I could ever have anticipated in recent years.
Basically never because I don‚Äôt want to get literally killed
When another woman showed me the way.
I was really nervous about it but I started semi-passing REALLY quickly and needed to start basically straight after commencing transition for my own safety.
My new school appearantly switched to gender neutral bathrooms in the year where i started and it made me so happy :)  In other cases i just hold it in
I am also nervous about my first venture into a women‚Äôs public restroom. I‚Äôve only been into neutral gender bathrooms at a medical facility. But since I have long hair, will be dressed fem and have makeup I think I‚Äôll be ok.
I stopped using gendered public restrooms maybe 2 months or so before I started hormones, and then either used single-occupancy ones or just held it. Used the right restroom for the first time last week - terrifying but I'm glad finally I faced my fears! Nobody said anything, thank goodness.
In 7th grade, few months after I came out
I just kinda waited until I got weird looks in the wrong bathroom, also just walk in and don't act like something is different. I convinced myself that it was just the same thing, and I have never been told I'm in the wrong place
I just use both whenever i feel like it
Presently I will only go into gender neutral bathrooms, which are exclusively baby changing or disabled bathrooms, in my experience. I'm never going in to the men's again. When I start HRT I'll start using the women's.
I‚Äôm enby and use whichever is available/cleaner. I sometimes get looks but nobody has ever said anything. Sometimes people look around to see if THEY‚ÄôRE in the bathroom they identify with.
To answer the question, probably within the first month of coming out.
I‚Äôm back and forth a lot, depending on how fem I dressed/feel that day. So far, I‚Äôve never been questioned, but I‚Äôm very oblivious so I‚Äôm not sure what to think. I think I pass but I‚Äôm not 100% sure.
I use the only gender neutral bathroom there is like anywhere.
For me it depends on where I am and the situation
I just hold it till home because public bathrooms are gross
For me its a whenever i need to and theres no neutral.  So places like gas stops or restaurants.
I use both. If I go into a mens room and there‚Äôs men in there I switch

Sometimes if I‚Äôm in a mens room and a guy gives me a dirty look I stop at the mirror and fix my makeup
I still use either depending on how I'm presenting that day. If I'm wearing pants and a loose shirt I will 100% just go to the men's room so I can use the urinal lmao
I was scared once on a campsite because of the gendered bathrooms. I was with my dad, he was like just come with me (I'm ftm). So I went there and I was fucking scared. After a while I just, tried going to the men's restroom. Look a bit angry for masculinity, just go to a stall quickly and out quickly. After a while it just got less scary.
Oh I just asked at first now I don't have to
I switched after using a stall in the mens room at my university and someone opened the stall door, stood there for a whole ass minute, said sorry, stood there for like 30 more seconds, then walking away. Luckily I was standing to pee but I felt like I was about to be hit in the back of my head the whole time. I am sure I confused the hell out of the kid because from behind I definitely pass.

Now I pee before I leave no matter where I am going. I also avoid using public restrooms as much as possible and seek out single stalls with locking doors.
When men started doing double takes when they saw me in the men's room
I stopped going in the mens room when guys would come into a smaller bathroom (2 toilets 2 urinals), see me (usually with my son), and walk out and let me have the restroom to myself until I was finished with it.

It was about that time that I completely stopped boymoding. I just realized today I haven't seen a porcelain urinal in months.
I get really confused picking a bathroom. I get embarrassed going into the girls bathroom but have no problems when I do. But when I go into the mens bathroom because I am embarrassed I get stopped and someone tells me ""this is the mens bathroom"". Which is euphoric in its own way but it makes me feel embarrassed when I try to pick either way.

So now.. I pretty much just use the girls bathroom without issues which makes me pretty happy. Though I don't like public restrooms and try to avoid them altogether.
i recently went to one of the biggest art festivals in america, which happens 2 be local. both days i wore a skirt and crop top and knee highs and chokers. i live in the bible belt so it wasnt the best. i had 2 use the bathroom and i paused b4 going into th mens bc of how i looked and i was panicking. there was a line 4 the girls room so ppl just assumed i was a girl waiting in line. wen i went into the boys room a guy left as i did and 3 of the girls in line thought that i just got tired of waiting and asked if they could go in there too.

i hav not started hrt yet and, despite not really passing, ppl assumed i was going to the girls room
Well... Not very long after coming out. As soon as I went out with girl-ish clothes, a hella long hair and particles of makeup on my face I begun to go for the women's bathroom. Additionally, many cis men would be stupid and visibly uncomfortable upon seeing me inside the men's bathroom using a cropped top or anything of the sort while women in general (both friends and strangers) always encouraged me to use the women's bathroom upon realizing/being told I'm trans. I think how people take that is usually tied to the place you're doing it and how much trans people are accepted in this mean.  


But regardless of any of this, you should just use the room you're more comfortable with right now. I strongly believe saying you're trans in any stage of transition should suffice and people shouldn't be denied their rights for ""not looking like a man/woman"" in this case; but I do know some countries are a bit more harsh on this matter.
i'm blind so i just walk in to whatever bathroom i find first and if people say something about it i just tell them i'm sorry but take a wizz anyway. 
When people see me with my guide dog they always bring me to the special bathroom for the disabled witch is gender nutral so guess this is one of the few ocations my blindness coms in handy. :)
As a femboy. I still wonder which one to go in. Would I go in male but people would look at me or if I go in female I‚Äôll get weird looks.
Honestly for me it me like month 7 on E to start to use the right bathroom, but I typically just try to go at home before I leave the house.
I'm pretty lucky as an enby to have not one but two gender neutral bathrooms in my school (basically just converted from gendered ones to neutral by putting period product bins in and removing any urinals. They still have coded paintings which means the blue ones are gross because boys usually use them and the purple ones are AMAZING as someone who has always had to deal with male bathrooms and found them eternally disgusting. Sorry this has been a very long tangent lol) and I started to use them regularly about two months ago, so about a year and a half after having come out at school and 3 years into my transition. In public? It sucks I pretty much always use male ones seeing as I still present quite masculine. Treat gender neutral ones like a holy grail or something they're just so rare and so very welcome.
Day one? I'm a bit of an odd duck, when I came out I didn't so much come out of the closet as burn the motherfucker down.

I started living as me full time as of that day, bathrooms included.

Now, that being said, I live in a very LGBTQ+ friendly city in Canada.
I still use the female bathroom because I'm terrified of being harassed if I go into the men's, and unfortunately my school just got rid of the gender neutral bathroom :(
As soon as I came out, I never wanted to boy mode ever again so long as I live, I haven't been in a male labeled bathroom since. It still took until recently (two years in, still no HRT) to use a female labeled bathroom, I only used it a few times, and it was luckily empty. I don't pass, but I think I can probably male fail with hair done, a mask on, the top half of my makeup done, a padded bra, fem clothes and no conversation for short periods of time. During tha gap that I hated the idea of using the men's bathroom, but had no confidence in using the women's, I'd go to the bathroom before leaving the house, I'd hold it when I was out, and I wouldn't drink much until I was back home (I don't have a lot to do out of the house, so it wasn't the end of the world). I don't think it's safe or healthy, so I don't have much experience that I'd advise, but I guess it's technically an option, if you know at some point you'll need the bathroom whether you're ready to use the correct one or not. I don't think it's going to not be terrifying for a long time.
Wish I could answer tho question unfortunately I am not even close from doing tgat yet. Not out of fear but cause I am still closeted and it would just be weird
I have around b to c cups at this point? It's really hard to hide now, and with a mask and a ponytail I think I pass ok.
I started presenting myself outwardly as trans when Covid struck and I think wearing masks REALLY helped with my confidence.. once i had figured out how to have a somewhat 'female'-ish appearance, the mask was the last thing I needed to hide any remaining masculinity. Now I don't avoid eye contact in the ladies bathroom, if they stare without smiling I glare them down. No one has ever said anything.

All I gotta do is keep my mouth zipped and look pretty ü§ê

One thing that makes me uncomfortable though is being in the women's bathroom if there are very young kids there. I feel like some conservative karen mom will have a go at me for exposing her kids to trans politics or something by existing in the women's bathroom lol.
when i was only on natural products a couple months (i couldn't get the real stuff, so was doing what i could), i had a job as a cleaner.

i had been finally using transdermal estriol cream about two months when i started the job.  so not much changes.  but i had started growing my hair out for a year, so people routinely thought that i was female from behind and the sides (i'm intersex, so my hips are wide and pelvis rotated... got teased for that a lot, although it was euphoric :P lol)

anyway, i figured that if i was cleaning the women's bathrooms everyday, that there was no reason i couldn't pee there as well (i was dressing female already).  that and the men's room just... the smell was so bad i hated having to clean there... didn't want to also use the toilet there too.  blech... :P
Honestly as long as there's not a line, you can get away with using whatever restroom you want. You're probably not going to encounter anyone for longer than a second to walk past each other
When I started transitioning my job had gender neutral bathrooms. That made things really easy for me. I think when I ditched my ""guy clothes"" was around the same time I ditched the men's room.
I'm transfem, I rarely have to use gendered bathrooms, but when I do it's often an awful experience.

When I go to men's bathrooms, on top of it being usually dirty, I sometimes get mockeries, laughs, weird looks. It's like being in the bathroom some people completely unleash their awful behaviour.

When I go the women's bathrooms, it's hard enough to feel legitimate, but I sometimes receive remarks (I dress fem, but I don't really pass), and few times it has been really violent (people asking if I had done genital surgery and saying that if I didn't I should be in the other bathroom).

These things don't happen everytime, most of the time nobody cares, but a few times are enough to instill the anxiety of going in there.

I generally just avoid public bathrooms, and I try my best so that whenever I participate in an event, the bathrooms are not bigendered. Of course it's not as easy, because some people (myself included) need a place where they feel safe. In some queer festivals I've been to, the bathroom where separated : one for cismen, and the other for everyone else.
I feel like I‚Äôm too masc to make sense in the women‚Äôs restroom, but too short/curvy to be stealth in the men‚Äôs restroom, so I usually feel uncomfy no matter where I go. I wish every place just had floor to ceiling doors in a gender neutral space.
You use the correct bathroom when you feel comfortable about it. I don't really pass but I use my correct bathroom, I don't care. What are they gonna do? Just protect yourself at the least, cause people are shitty yk.
this is why gender neutral bathrooms need to be the norm
In college, after I started using they/them pronouns but before starting medical transition, I‚Äôd typically use gender neutral restrooms on campus. When there wasn‚Äôt a gender neutral restroom I‚Äôd use the women‚Äôs. Recently within the past few months, around two years on HRT, I started using mens bathrooms. This was because when I‚Äôd ask for directions to the restroom at restaurants and such, the employees would direct me to the mens restroom, and then it would be weird if I didn‚Äôt use the mens restroom after they‚Äôd told me to do there. At my workplace the only staff bathroom is single stall gender neutral, but it‚Äôs out of order because the sink fell off of the wall (??????) so I‚Äôm using the male multi-stall customer restroom. Fortunately it‚Äôs a small restroom (two stalls, and one urinal around a corner well-hidden to the point that when you walk in you can‚Äôt even see if someone‚Äôs at the urinal) so there‚Äôs rarely anyone else in it at the same time as me.
I'm probably an outlier here, but I started using it the very next time I had to go while I was out. üòÖ When I decided to come out I kinda jumped in with both feet, getting enough clothes to put a couple basic outfits together right away. And masks help a *lot* more than you think with passing if you're not there yet. 

Regardless of that, what I've heard from many others is that it's when you present as your true gender. And conversely, if you ever have to go out in agab mode again, just throw on the mask and go in that restroom. Confidence is absolutely key, as others in this thread have said. If you walk in like you're supposed to be there, and go straight to doing your business, no one will bat an eye. They're likely more concerned with their own appearance or proceedings than they are with whatever you're doing.
I'm waiting for my top surgery myself . Considering I'm hauling around triple D's and I haven't found a good way to bind so I just gave up and decided to run around as a bearded lady. Which honestly I thought I would get more flak for but I'm a heavier guy so perhaps some people just shrug it off and say ""dang that guy has huge moobs."" idk but once these things are gone I'm ready to finally switch bathrooms.
As a non binary person I still use the female restroom because I'm on stealth and gender netural bathrooms are rare.
Whenever I was in a place where my friends or family wouldn‚Äôt know I‚Äôd use the mens bathroom
I started using the woman‚Äôs washroom at my college after two months on hrt, I don‚Äôt really pass but no one was ever in the washroom I used so I never had to worry about it. Though walking to that washroom did take awhile since it was tucked into a corner
When I 100% realized and accepted that I‚Äôm trans and feel wrong going to the wrong bathroom. Well, a bit after because I was scared. Expecially awkward when going to bathroom and there is people you know and you think they think you went to the wrong bathroom..
I try to avoid all public restrooms because I can‚Äôt stand to pee and I feel like that gives it away. When I absolutely have to use the bathroom, like an emergency, I use the men‚Äôs
I had taken small steps in spaces where I could be myself like in group therapy (I even selfied myself in front of a urinal lmao), but when it came to regular public restrooms I used the woman‚Äôs room as long as I could because men‚Äôs rooms are disgusting. It took until someone said ‚Äúhey dude that‚Äôs the woman‚Äôs room‚Äù when I was walking in one to finally switch. Low key miss womens rooms I don‚Äôt care about anything other than cleanliness haha
I am pre everything, I use the male bathrooms mostly but I also judge the area, if I think it'll be an issue I ask behind the bar if they have a policy against it, if they confirm they do not or they'll have my back I head into the males, I'm yet to come across a place that opposes it.
The second I was sure I passed enough to not get the shit kicked out of me when I went in there... or when nobody else was around lol
Well, I actually kept using the women‚Äôs bathroom for a long time, even after I started going by he/him and a new name and cutting my hair short and binding. I‚Äôd get weird looks while I was in there, but nobody ever said anything to me. I also never went in alone; I always brought someone like my sister or one of my female friends. 

I was nervous to use the men‚Äôs bathroom, and I think I had been socially transitioning for maybe a year before I started using it. Even at school, I would just use the single-stall teacher bathrooms they had, even though I was allowed to use literally any bathroom in the entire building that I wanted. I also wouldn‚Äôt change in the boys‚Äô locker room. I changed in the equipment room. 

I was certainly passing as male before I switched bathrooms. Every time I went in the women‚Äôs bathroom people would stare or glance in my direction. They‚Äôd stop if I started talking to someone like my sister or whatever because they‚Äôd hear my voice. 

I think I started going in the men‚Äôs room in the summer after my freshman year in high school which was about two years (give or take) after my social transition.
I started using the correct bathroom for me, as soon as I got my hair cut short and was out to all of my friends.
Honestly as a nonbinary person I use both bathrooms depending on what physical traits get noticed that day. If I'm getting called maam or miss then i know its a day i use the girls or if my beard is all grown out i use the boys.

But honestly this is just how it works for me and I think its a good one to go buy. BUT if you just cant take it anymore:

-Go in with purpose

-Quickly wave (brief, BRIEF wave) if they say hi or acknowledge you then hurry calmly to the stall. No one acknowledges you too much. Just make it quick like you really need to go. (women's bathroom)

or

-If someone acknowledges you or says ""how you doing"" ignore them or nod. Nobody really does this but on occasion you will have someone do so. Just nod. Dont wave. Get to your stall like you need to go. (men's bathroom)

-with both gendered bathrooms make sure to cover your bits with your shorts, pants, or skirt. It'll look nerdy a bit but cover it up while you go and text on your phone while you do so. I've had fuckers in the women's come over my stall door on the feminine looking days and only got saved because I was bleeding. I wanted to fucking punch that bitch. (women are usually respectful and the reason i didn't go find her ass is because an older lady chewed her out anyways x'D)

-men dont want to do it but dont think one day they wont. everyone will try to steal a look at your crotch if they think your ""suspicious"" but I gotta say it happens more in the girls. Just... becareful regardless.This is coming from someone who can nearly shapeshift to both restrooms. Shit happens.

-Act Confident. BE confident. You'll make it through this and you may or may not pass but you'll be way more safe if you look like you know what you are doing.

Im send you strength and loveüíï
I was a pretty twinky boy, so I started going to the women's washroom (my actual gender) very early in transition. Basically as soon as I got clothes that fit my true gender.
I feel so stupid going to my gendered bathroom. I dont pass yet and ive gotten weird looks when i went to male's as a child when there was a long queue to woman's. 
So now im gonna wait untill i pass and people wont give me weird looks. (Also i dont wanna be asoulted and that c9uld happen in like truck stops on highway etc)
Perks of being a idol (/j) I don't really use the bathroom at all
Pre T, the first time I used the right bathroom was at a concert (which looking back wasn't a great idea because it STANK)
I mostly use the mens unless I'm having a bad passing day, but most people don't care enough to give me trouble.
as soon as i came out
The only public bathroom I use is at work, and even the cis girls in my department use the men's. The uniform makes everyone look like a weird frumpy guy. 
 
I use the gender neutral as much as possible because it's solitary and cleaner.
As soon as I started publicly presenting as my true gender.
My school was willing to allow me to use the women's bathroom, but I only did it once I was on HRT it's a lot easier to convince yourself to use female facilities when you have boobs.
I went to the restroom at a club one night and literally all the girls were so nice to me even though I was not passing at all (in my mind anyway) and I‚Äôm so thankful for them ü•∫ ever since then if I‚Äôm not in stealth mode I go to the womens restroom and never once have I had anyone even stare at me. And I live in the Deep South üòÖ
I'm like 4 years deep, (3 years on HRT) and I still use the mens room unfortunately.  


I don't wanna get stabbed + Urinals are just so god damn convenient
I did it when I felt ready
mid 2020, decided i was done dealing w/ my transphobic school so i used the mens room regularly,
i got yelled at for being in the girls room so then i knew it was time. i still get nervous sometimes but i get more weird looks in the girls room
i have to wait until im passable

thought in my school it would probably be fine cuz the bathrooms are juts one tiny room and the only difference is that the men's bathroom has pee on the floor
as soon as i came out. probably easier for me to do as a trans man, i can‚Äôt imagine trans women would have it so easy. nobody ever said anything but i live in canada (specifically southern ontario) so it‚Äôs a very safe place for trans people.
i started goin in the mens as soon as i came out. nobody has ever said anything to me or looked at me weird or anything :]
I‚Äôm just not a fan of public washrooms in general
I had socially transitioned, didn't pass at all but once I had become comfortable introducing myself by my chosen name, as my brothers brother instead of sister, as my parents son instead of daughter, I just started using the mens room. It was awkward as hell the first few times but there was something I'd heard on a a TV show, I'm pretty sure Burn Notice that helped a lot. 

It said, if you behave as if you belong somewhere, as if that's where you are supposed to be, most people won't even question it. So I enter the men's room with the same ""I belong here, this is my place"" mentality as going into my own bedroom. Some guys would do a double take, some guys would ask if it was the men's room and I just answered ""Yeah"" and that was that. Yes it's the men's room, yeah I know, I belong here.
i avoid them, as i‚Äôm not sure which one i‚Äôll get stared at in more. i‚Äôve been in the male‚Äôs room a few times with no problem (still pre-t but have passed as male since like 9), but it makes me uneasy because i don‚Äôt think i look it enough.
I started going to the womens restroom when I started wearing womens' clothes and makeup so like a few weeks ago lol. I mean I think it would be even weirder to go into the mens room wearing a skirt, womens platform boots, feminine jacket, makeup, etc. So like if u present as your real gender it's fine unless u live somewhere super transphobic where it could be dangerous then I'd probably try to avoid public restrooms altogether. My advice is if it makes you anxious is to go with earbuds in. No one will say anything anyway but wearing earbuds is a good unwanted socialization deterrent. And walk in there with confidence it doesn't matter if u don't pass!!
i went into a male bathroom On Purpose a few months back in school!!! bc im pre-T and nervous about.passing, when someone walked in i nearly shat myself (very lucky i was in the bathroom!) but ! i just sat in the little stall and waited for him to leave before i walked out
Places just need to build gender neutral bathrooms. My University just built all gender bathrooms and it‚Äôs great. Don‚Äôt need to think about which one to use. üëå
I go to a gender neutral bathroom‚Ä¶I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd be able to go to the male‚Äôs because they‚Äôd make fun of me
Day 0 ü•¥
For a while after realising I used the disabled toilets and the first (and only) time I boymoded at some family gathering I used the women‚Äôs to help with the incredible amounts of dysphoria and it felt incredible
Just when I saw an Instagram post of my government that said that transgender people are allowed to go on their real gender bathrooms. That was at a moment I was searching for a long time for the courage to do it because I came out to my school
I‚Äôm 20 months into my transition (mtf) and I still get gendered male 70% of the time‚Ä¶ but then men and women complement me on my appearance a lot more‚Ä¶ and I‚Äôve gone in the ladies‚Äô room a couple of times and other than feeling really self-conscious myself, nothing really happened. So idk ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I used my real gender bathroom before transition ;~; (i went to the female bathroom before i started meds to become a female)
This doesn‚Äôt apply to me since I‚Äôm nonbinary and I don‚Äôt even use the bathroom that‚Äôs closer to my gender (the male bathroom), but if this did apply, I‚Äôd switch once someone says ‚ÄúYou‚Äôre in the wrong bathroom.‚Äù If you want to be sure, you can wait for it to happen three times
I'll only start going to the men's bathroom when I have a beard or a natural passable voice that doesn't have to be forced. Until then. I'm sticking to women's or disabled toilets.
I use the mens bathroom in public but when I‚Äôm in school I‚Äôve only ever used it once, If my hair was just a normal color not *bright green* I‚Äôd probably pass just fine

Edit: oh but I once went into the woman‚Äôs locker room and this friend of mine shouts ‚ÄúI THOUGHT YOU WERE A GUY‚Äù after I followed my school dad in there (also trans guy) and I just stood there in shock. Like I don‚Äôt have the confidence to go in the mens room and they didn‚Äôt want me in the woman‚Äôs one. Plus everyone stared at me after that, I just kinda lurked until I could leave after that. That was the first time I ever went in there the entire school year, haven‚Äôt gone in there since.
I still will try to find an all gender (private stall) restroom if possible. I guess it took me until about 8 months in to decide to go for it. The thing is, I do live in New York State and the law is on my side--to the extent that it's pretty common to see signs that say explicitly that people can use the bathroom that matches their gender identity. But it is still scary af.
I always look for the family bathroom.. I personally like the privacy.. for no reason other than I like to poop by myself and not smell someone else‚Äôs right next to me.. gross!! Esp after the pandemic going back to pooping next to a stranger is just too much!
When my ""beard"" started to make me look like a prepubescent school boy, when the women started looking at me weirdly.
Me when i was diagnosed with gender dysphoria it was sometime in December with my spouse at Mitsuwa in Illinois it was a lil scary at first but when I actually went to sit down i was able to just go. When i was going to the mens restroom if a man walked in i could be ready to pee my pants and couldn‚Äôt go till they left so yeahüò∞
The day I switched was the day I was in my agab bathroom and confused a middle age man as I was walking out. It was honestly very funny but from that day on I just sorta used the other bathroom. Only if there's no family/gender neutral restrooms tho.
i literally never use public bathrooms anymore but since i am now starting to socially transition i‚Äôll probably start using the men‚Äôs bathroom when i really need to
The day after I started HRT I wasted no time. I‚Äôm going on 3 years now and I‚Äôm where I belong.
Mine was similar. Had a guy come in while I was washing my hands, look at me, freeze, say ""Sorry, wrong bathroom!"" Back out, check the door, then come back in and look at *me* like *I* was crazy. Moved to the women's room next time I had to pee.
That's something that happened to me, but in the men's bathroom. Unfortunately, I still don't feel comfortable using the women's room so I just search out gender neutral bathrooms everywhere I go.
I wish there was a trend to post a picture and people would tell you if they saw you in the *agab* bathroom would they think you are in the wrong bathroom or went like ""oh I guess it's a *agab*""
I distinctly remember walking into a bathroom in college, and the person walking out talked quietly out the side of his mouth saying ""wrong bathroom"" to try and save me embarrassment. I went full time a few weeks afterward.

God what a weird time that was.
Similar here, once I started getting dirty looks from women in the bathroom I knew it was time to use the men's one lol
Yup! I let other people tell me
shout ‚Äùi just want to pee!!!‚Äù next time /jk
Walking in like your supposed to be there is the best advice I read here on reddit when trying to figure this out, too. I think I've noticed 1 person stare at me, buuuut I live in a super conservative part of the LA area that is known for its anti lgbt and support of trump, so I kinda expect it here. Even at that, it was once, and I started using my real gender bathroom almost immediately during my transition.

OP it also helps to go with a friend who can spot ya in case you are feeling uncomfortable.
I am so sorry. This is why I haven‚Äôt tried yet. That negative social interaction would kill my entire week
i love all of this, really well articulated and it absolutely should be an american standard
I live in Colorado too, I didn't know they passed a bill for that.
Thats a bit of an assumption on your part. Lots of transwomen do pass, telling people they likely never will is not ok.
Honestly, you can get anywhere if you walk like you're supposed to be there. Contrary to what many people think, most people are too worried about themselves to care what other people are doing, so as long as you look like you belong, they won't question it. I once got lost as a scout and wandered through a military camp, and I only got stopped because a captain was trying to tell me I should have been marching. They didn't even realise my uniform was wrong until then.
This was my experience with buying woman‚Äôs clothes for the first time after transitioning. My whole life it was always so anxiety ridden when buying my girls clothes before I came out. 

Then I realized that shopping for womens clothes when you‚Äôre WEARING WOMENS CLOTHES makes it so much more relaxing. Like, duh, I‚Äôm supposed to be here lol
totally agree! even before i started HRT i just went in the girls bathroom bc i know that nobody can beat my ass. even if people stared i didn‚Äôt notice tbh
It made me feel kinda good. Like yeah, I got yelled at, but this woman thought I was a man so that was cool.
Pretty sure this person is a guy
I came back to say, I hope you begin to live a life not dictated by how other people feel. You deserve it.
Look up bathroom laws in Colorado.  Senate Bill 200 

""Colorado's Senate Bill 200 allows any person of any gender, gender identification or sexuality access to any public or private bathroom. All businesses or places subject to discriminatory laws are required to follow this act of non-discrimination. Failure to comply can result in a fine to the discriminating party. The restitution of at least 50 dollars and no more than 500 dollars is paid to the victim of discrimination. The reason for this Senate bill is that many transgendered or homosexual persons were not being allowed use of certain bathroom facilities. Senate Bill 200 also applies to bathrooms and locker rooms in schools. However, bathrooms in religious institutions are still allowed to discriminate according to gender.""  https://legalbeagle.com/6809448-bathroom-laws-colorado.html
This is where it's always kinda wonky with this community, because on one hand I think you're right, but on the other hand I definitely think the trans community has a problem with making promises they can't keep. I think it is *healthy* to remind people on here that transitioning won't always give you the result you want, even if that can be a bit heartbreaking. With that said though, we should still encourage transitioning all together.

Just my 5 cents on it. Telling people they will never pass is not ok, but telling people they will pass no matter what isn't really okay either.
They‚Äôre just saying you don‚Äôt have to pass to use a certain bathroom. Because some people might not ever pass (myself included), but they still should be able use the restroom they‚Äôre comfortable in.
I‚Äôm not making any assumptions about OP. I‚Äôm just saying that passing as cis is beside the point. Did you read my post?
This is under realized advice. You can go anywhere with looking confident and a clipboard
I just walked into my old school without an id or anything and nobody stopped me. If you look like you are supposed to be there, then most people just won't question it. I've also seen videos of people just walking out of stores with big palettes of sodas because they had a neon vest on
So true! I used to do the I am buying it for my girlfriend routine before socially transitioning and it worked better than I expected. I even got compliments on my taste and told she's a lucky girl üòÇ
buying stuff for my ex-spouse and daughters was always easy.  idk why.  guess cos i knew they needed stuff, so buying even panties and bras for them when i was alone was... idk, i didn't think anything of it.  No idea if anyone was looking at me as if i was insane.  and technically all the stuff for my ex would have fit me too if i had wanted to use it.  (i didn't want to until my body changed... seemed kinda pointless and sad, tbh).
Oh! Well that‚Äôs awesome aside from getting yelled at :)
Yeah just realized I read it wrong lol
Telling a bunch of us that we'll never pass is not okay. There's a better way to frame the opening to their comment, like ""We're not obligated to pass, but if you're living as a woman, dressing as a woman, etc etc"".
At my work, I recently found out even just a hi-vis vest gets you anywhere. I‚Äôve been there for all of a month and I just popped on a high-vis and after I felt I had done enough of my job that I‚Äôd normally just be standing around for 20-30 minutes anyway, I went on a walk around the parts I hadn‚Äôt been to.

No one batted an eye, and I got to check out interesting things. Worth my while, I‚Äôd say.

Obviously though don‚Äôt wear a hi-vis to your real-gender bathroom, though. Just be confident in that case.
Add a blank white badge and you would be amazed at how few people question you authority. Pen testing videos taught me a lot.
I've heard of people stealing TVs like that
Lol omg same

I do NOT miss those days
It‚Äôs just a fact that heaps of us don‚Äôt pass. It‚Äôs really hurtful to act like there is something wrong with that.
Hmm, a hi-vis might be perfect for distracting people though‚Ä¶
A strange tenet..
At cadets, we mainly rely on looking at badges to identify each other. I remember just yesterday my flight commander was ahead of me in the attendance and asked me something like ""I'm AC \*flight commander's name\*, do you know what to say to the attendance guy?"" He just got a new uniform and hadn't had time to sew the badges on and because we use last names I assumed he was his brother or something. I honestly had a huge brain fart and just couldn't remember what to say so I just said ""sorry I don't know"" then when he said his name to the CI taking attendance he said ""sir, warrant officer second class \*name\* reporting as present"" and I realized I screwed up lol. (I'm a sergeant so I'm expected to at least know basic stuff like this)
yeah im not surprised
‚ÄúWhat are you doing in here?! Get out!‚Äù

‚ÄúFixing the pipes, do you wanna use the bathroom or not?‚Äù

If you never had any human interaction for the rest of your life, would you still transition?	"I (MtF) was talking with a friend and we got on to the subject of my transition (of course). They are very supportive, but also really curious. Based on some of the questions they were asking, I could tell they're understanding of what transition is (for me, at least) was not complete. Like most people I've encountered so far, they always think about the impacts of my transition on other people, like trans women in women's sports, or bathroom bills or terfs believing we're destroying women's spaces.

I explained to my friend that for me, even if I never had another conversation with anyone else, never had another single human interaction for the rest of my life, I would still transition. I would still pay hundreds of dollars per painful session to get facial hair blasted off my face, I would still take my hormones, and I would still undergo painful and expensive surgeries. I am transitioning so my physical body finally matches that mental picture I have of myself. That dissonance exists in me regardless of whether other humans exist or not.

Anyone else agree?"	"I'd transition *sooner*
Hell I think that would make it way easier. If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, almost all my fears and doubts about medical transition would go away. Sure I might still have to deal with the occasional impostor syndrome but my other apprehensions have a lot to do with social interactions.
If I never had to interact with another person, I would be all in, boy mode gone, living as me. While it is important for those I love to see me as me, it is even more important for me to be able to see me as me.
I think a big element of the transgender experience is the social aspect, the element of being socially seen as who we are on the inside. That said, I'd still have started my transition if I wasn't going to socialize at all.
Ya I‚Äôd still have to look in a mirror, no?
I haven't had any meaningful human interaction in going on 7 years, and there's nothing I want more than to be a woman.

You might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. My life really is that empty.
For sure. I transitioned for myself not society ya know?
i‚Äôm terrible with these ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios because i always take them to the extreme.

i‚Äôd have to say if there was no social/interpersonal aspect of my life then there wouldn‚Äôt really be a need for me to transition. i would have no bodies to compare my own to. if no one was observing me, then i wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about whether i am read correctly. it would just be me, and i already know i‚Äôm a man. (actually, without any human interaction, i may just identify as ‚Äúhuman‚Äù. because how can something separate (a ‚Äúman‚Äù) exist unless there are other men to compare to, or women and non-binary folk to contrast to?)

if i‚Äôm still getting some level of human engagement (through something like media, for example), then i would have more reason to want to alter my body to make it align with what i identify with/value.

if a robot doctor was prescribing me testosterone, i might still take it. t does have an effect on my brain, but i think the biggest changes it makes is that i feel more comfortable existing in my body *within society* while on it (and yes, i do like how i look with the masculinization that testosterone brings to my face and body, but if it‚Äôs just me, do i *really* care how i look?). i would definitely have to reassess how i felt off of t in that situation. also, without human interaction, i would find my testosterone-induced libido pretty annoying. i still have my ovaries, so letting my body make his own hormones would just be simpler. 

i‚Äôve already had top surgery, but if i had to do it again in this hypothetical situation, i might? i never liked my chest but my main issue with it was that it prevented me from successfully living as a man. i would possibly get rid of them again only for convenience‚Äôs sake (they were large, heavy, and would sweat something fierce on the underboob).

in this hypothetical situation, i think i would actually opt for other types of modifications to change my body. can i get horns? can i get black sclera? can i get an extra 6‚Äù to my height? can i get fangs? if i‚Äôm not interacting with other people, i no longer have to worry about how my appearance will be received by them so why not go nuts?
If I didn‚Äôt have any human interaction for the rest of my life? I‚Äôd die of boredom, but yeah I‚Äôd absolutely still transition.
Yes. Absolutely.
Yes I still would, the social aspects are a big part but it's also how I want to see myself, matching up who I am mentally and physically for me.

I spend a good chunk of time alone and feel so much more at ease with myself now than pre-transition. So still definitely would no question.
I work from home and generally stay in Sunday to Thursday, so I'm basically doing that already bar the couple of work friends and my gf lol
Fwiw, when you go a decade or more without any friends or family, you begin to barely understand the immense trauma, damage and excruciatingly horrible pain of what you're talking about. Being a pariah, excluded and isolated is much worse than most can ever imagine, especially when your own ""community"" contributes excessively due to classism and selfishness. 0l

Transition without the necessary resources is worse than death for many of us. 

I expect downvotes and massive silencing of this reality to ensue. That is the new social media cancelling way.
holy shit that was eye opening - I've been questioning if I should come out/transition lately and the second I read your title I was like, ""Yes??? Of course if I was able to transition without anyone being able to criticize I would!""

And then I realized - Now I feel VERY validated, thanks OP :))
If i had a job, earned money and still hadn't to talk to anyone, i would transition earlier than i'm planning. But i would take it much easier.
I absolutely agree. Even if i never had to interact with others, the experience of existing in a body that isnt mine is distressing or just very dissociative. Ever since starting T i can slowly start seeing my body as mine, my voice is sounding more like how i hear myself in my head, and it feels like my emotions are getting regulated in the best ways. Im transitioning to not just love the body i exist in, but to make the body *mine*
The fear of judgement by other people is what held me back from transitioning for a while. If I didn‚Äôt have to interact with people I would have transitioned earlier.
I think that's exactly why we're seeing so many if us cracking during the pandemic. Without the noise and expectations, it's so much easier to be ourselves.
I would transition and become best friends with a football.
Fuck yes. Its not about anyone else, its about me and who I see looking back at me from the mirror.
Are we talking biblical-rapture style, here? Like the world is still here but everyone else is gone? If I was the last woman on earth the FIRST thing I'm doing is burning my old wardobe and walking naked to a mall for a shopping spree.
Absolutely. Even when I was in 1st or 2nd grade, I would randomly cry about ""not wanting to be a girl"" but I didn't understand why I felt that way so I just ignored my feelings. If I could have transitioned, if I knew what that was at the time, I absolutely would have done it - but I had no idea what the LGBTQ community was. I just knew I wanted to somehow transition, but I didn't know what to call it or how to do it. If I never interacted with any humans ever up until that point, I would absolutely still decide to transition.

This is a little off-topic, but this is also why I think it's very important for LGBTQ stuff to be taught in schools or at least talked about. It would have saved me so many years of confusion and random breakdowns in bed if I knew what being trans was
Where is this mysterious island of nobody but trees of estrogen and transformation fruit that is devoid of human contact?

Asking for some friends...
What? Yeah, of course! That would make everything so much easier
Yes
hell yes i would! im not transitioning for anyone but myself
probably not medically. maybe hormones. I'd like hormones. but I don't have too much body dysphoria. Actually the body dysphoria I do have mostly comes from thinking that other people think I look like a man lol
Yeah... I mean... A big part of the reason I transitioned was because of body dysphoria so... I'd transition for that regardless of human contact.
Definitely. Wouldn‚Äôt voice train though lol
I transitioned for me, not for anybody else. The presence or absence of other people just doesn't figure into it.

Ironically, not transitioning is something I did for other people for a long time, so obviously their presence figured into that decision more than anything else.

I'll always regret not transitioning sooner, but I just have to keep looking forward at this point.
Yes, pne of my fantasies was to have a desert city for my self to be able to transition in peace
Absolutely. Most of my dysphoria is physical rather than social.
It's all about me. None of it is about them but they sure do like to personalize it.
Lmaoooo I am literally isolated from humans already as it is, I would hop on that so fast
I think of I never had to interact with anyone, I WOULD transitions.
With no hesitation I absolutely would still have done it. 

Hell, not talking to other people would be kind of a bonus tbh.
Abso-fuckin-lutley. shit would be way easier.
The biggest obstacle for me is transphobia and how other people treat me because I‚Äôm trans. If I never had to talk to anyone again I would be so happy and never anxious again lmao
Yes! No more fear of others not accepting!
Would I transition, yes! Absolutely, 100 percent I would. I'm not transitioning for anyone else, I'm doing it for me. Would I be happy, no, but not because of the reasons I am not happy now. I'd miss the fun of my d&d games, or spending time with a partner, but I would at least know that as miserable as I would be I would be my true self
Id be much more likely to transition all the way to be honest.
""Yes and . . . ""

I would do it to be more comfortable with my body. But the way I'm treated by people around me is definitely a factor in my transition. Being perceived as male/masculine is uncomfortable for me. 

Transition is both to be more comfortable with myself and to correct the perceptions that other people have of me.
On one hand yes ide transition cause dysphoria when I‚Äôm by myself is real, but ide definitely take more creative liberties with my transition if I was alone on an island with the stuff I needed to be comfortable magically delivered by unmanned boats. It would actually be cool minus the lag on my new island Xbox
Yes, absolutely. My transition is for *me*, first and foremost. I want to see myself the way I feel, and I don't need anybody else. Would be nice, though. :)
yes.
This will make the transition better not worst
Yes! It‚Äôs not about anyone else but me I wish to be comfortable in my own skin. In your scenario I hope my treatment team is still around though I am kind of fond of them! Ok and the kids and spouse! But the answer is yes.
I already barely socialize outside of work, also i feel like if anything itd make it easier. Removes the whole 'people perceiving me' part yknow
I mean that would be my worst nightmare because I‚Äôm a people-loving extrovert but I‚Äôd certainly at least still act & dress female, because I am. As for the other stuff, I‚Äôd certainly do something about my facial hair sooner than otherwise with less to distract me. But I‚Äôd feel less societal pressure to go further.
You really asking, would you eat for the rest of your life or drink water...
Probably. But life would probably be pretty short with no human interaction.
I would also choose to transition. I want to because I want to so I could do certain stuff I always wanted to
i would absolutely still transition. i don‚Äôt want top surgery to make other people happy, i want top surgery to make myself happy. making other people see me as more of a woman is just a plus.
Considering I was crossdressing when no one else was around, yes. But, the question assumes I'm the last person left alive on the planet and forget gender at that point because all of culture in general goes up in smoke. Gender is a social construct, if there are no people, there is no society, there is no ""social"" anything.

Feel like I'd have bigger more basic pressing issues then, like food, electricity, clean water...
Yes. Absolutely. 100000000%. Without any doubt. I can‚Äôt imagine why I wouldn‚Äôt. 

Transitioning is for me, not them.
Yes. I want titties
Yeah, have to agree with the majority here. It would only make things easier for me and ease a huge amount of anxiety around transition.
YES!! I would still transition.  My desire to gave a body which my brain's pre-wiring plugs in to... is that strong.

I have always known that I had female breasts, they just were not there.  I have always known that I have a vagina, I just don't have a connection into it from the outside.

I have always been a female, even though I never believed or even considered that could even be possible... because, penis.

I was never transgender before, because I didn't know transgender existed.  Well, it did, but only for some extremely miniscule number of people that might find an article here or there about. I would no more have considered that I was transgender because of the existence of ""those people""... than I believe I have 380 million dollars in my checking account because im NYC, someone won $380 million yesterday. Just because it happened to someone else... by no means means it happened to me.

Except, of course, it did.

The more I learned about it, the more I saw myself at every age of my lifetime. The more I saw a *girl*... at every age of my lifetime.

Sorry, was just reminiscing.  Yes, I would.  Yes, it's that strong
Absolutely. When I'm home alone, I don't wear men's clothes or even PJ's. I'd still put in my breast forms and wear skirts, dresses, etc. I might eschew makeup though if I never saw anyone else. The makeup makes me feel better when I'm somewhere without a mask on.
I haven't started anything yet but, no interaction would be amazing. People are the reason I haven't started anything.
I would. For me, (as big as it is for me) it's less a matter of how other people see me, and more a matter of whether or not I'm comfortable in my own body.
Yes.
For me, transitioning is largely about feeling at home in my body. The social changes are more of a mixed bag - overall good, but not the primary motivation for me. 

&#x200B;

If I had to choose between ""having exactly the body I want but being seen and treated as my AGAB"" versus ""keeping the same body, yet being seen and treated as my actual gender"" then I would choose the body changes without hesitation.
Fuck. Yes.
After thinking about it, yes, I would. 

It would make a lot of things easier but a lot of things harder but when it comes down to it, I was already alone and unhappy pretending to be a man. I've felt actual happiness just from breathing since getting on HRT and I've never felt that in my entire adult life. 

I still have my hairy face. I don't have breasts. My groin doesn't look or feel right but I didn't wake up this morning disappointed that I'm still here. I still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do but right now, I'm happy to be breathing and to see that there is a path forward. 

I'd like for part of that path forward to be to find someone to be with and that I can help along with their life but this is not the linchpin to my happiness.
So, in my very long journey to discover a meaningful ""why"" to justify how I felt before I was fully out of my egg, I came to a couple little thought experiments.

And, I asked myself, if I didn't have to worry about anyone else in the world. Nobody else mattered, and nobody would know. Would I still take that magic potion to change? And, at least, for me, it was a yes. 

At the end of the day, it's something I needed for myself. If anything, the existance of other people and their beliefs were one of the few things that made it more of a stressful thing that I tried to avoid and convince myself out of.
I feel it's my anxiety about human interactions that are holding me back from a move towards transitioning.  If it was just me on my own, hell yes!
Yes
Yes I would, I want to feel good with myself and feel comfortable  
Especially with my breast. I love to go swimming some day again but I just feel hella uncomfortable, even if I went swimming by myself.
Fuck yes. The only thing holding me back is other people. I face scrutiny, hate and harassment near daily. It would be so much easier without human interaction
Yeah of course. I have to spend 100% of my time with my body, I want to at least not absolutely loathe it.
Transmasc here.

Most of my dysphoria is social, or physical but related to how people perceive and subsequently gender a body that has breasts. I think if I just never saw other people ever again starting now, I‚Äôd still transition. Spending decades around people whose actions impacted my life shapes my perspective on everything‚Äîwhich is just how existing in society works‚Äîand will continue to, even if all that is permanently in the past.

Also, I was already frustrated with having periods long before I discovered my gender.
I would say that I would even do it more. But, I would perish from the lack of human interaction.
I honestly dont think i would. Because i would never have had a concept of gender. My body makes me uncomfortable because it doesnt match my gender. If i never had a concept of gender i wouldnt really care about my body and would just exist.
Yes absolutely
I mean, obviously. To me, the more relevant question is: ""Knowing that you'll have to live in the shitty world we do, would you transition?"" And for me the answer was yes. But if not for all the judgment and weird looks and legal issues and everything else that goes with transition that comes from *other people*, it would be a much easier choice.
Yes. A girl hermit is better than being a boy.
100% yes
I‚Äôm not transitioning for other people. I did it for me. I started transitioning to help my dysphoria and make me happy with myself. So yeah‚Äîhundred percent would have started transitioning even if no one were looking. It‚Äôs about me, not them.
i agree 100%, i'd transition no matter what. put simply: gender dysphoria is a bitch.
100% agree, if it was about public perception then it honestly would probably be easier for me to not transition at all, but this has nothing to do with public perception, it is for me and me alone, so I would certainly do it even if no one ever actually saw it.
Id take all the steps immediatly
Man can this happen, people suck ass I don't wanna talk to them
Yes
Hell yes, it's not about others it's about justice for me.
Hell yeah, its about me not anyone else. Its for my comfort not theirs im not gonna suffer just because i cant talk to people
hell yeah. absolutely
I would transition and it'd be easier because if I get a shitty haircut then nobody gets to see me with it
I'd still be stuck with myself, wouldn't I?
Yeah
Yes

I‚Äôve always coped well with isolation, and normally preferred it anyway. Most of my anxiety(outside of body dysphoria) comes from social situations.

Never having to interact with any human being ever would be an acceptable tradeoff for the ability to go a day without wanting to drive a knife into my stomach.
Actually this would motivate me to transition because I would know that no one would judge me
Yeah totally (tho not looking for surgeries myself), I'd love to have my face always be smooth wirhout constant maintenance, and I'd love to be able to look down and see boobs there
100%. it wouldn‚Äôt affect my decision at all actually. i‚Äôm transitioning for me, not for everyone else. being comfortable in my skin is top priority
lol assuming I have any human interaction now
If I never had to interact with anyone again, I‚Äôd start my transition this second. What‚Äôs keeping me is the dear of what others will think
yeag
The only reason I haven‚Äôt done it yet is BECAUSE of human interaction. Also ADHD being a bitch but yknow.
Yes I want tiddy and better hips and a cuter face and I've wanted that since I was 14 years old.
My transition (and while I am cautious to speak for all trans people, I imagine most if not all of us) has nothing to do with *other* people. If my identity was decided based on other people, then I wouldn't have transitioned... because a lot of (cis) people treat us very poorly for it and don't want us to do it.

I think the problem is that a lot of cis people assume that trans people transition for attention, but I don't think any of us want being trans to be a focal point of how we're viewed by other people... which means that if being trans is getting us any attention, then it's probably not the kind that we want. üò≥
Yes lol
I would have transitioned sooner
Oh fuck yes. No question at all. HRT is one of the best things ever to happen to me
..If It succesfully gets me what I want, then yes, definitely, a lot of cis people don't understand it. In fact, If I wouldn't interact with others I would do it sooner because I wouldn't feel all ashamed or scared of others their judgement. On the other hand, if I never had social interactions at all, I wouldn't really realize what I was missing/wanted in the first place so the option would have to be presented to me first.
üíØ this is definitely it for me.  I'm transitioning for me.  Sure it'd be nice to pass in public for safety reasons, but the goal has always been to feel comfortable and happy in my own skin.
Yes, I would still want to transition. I much rather enjoy having estrogen be my primary hormone than testosterone. If I never had anymore human interaction, I could freely wear whatever feminine clothing I want without fear of judgement or harassment.
Same. I would still medically transition regardless, because I am still stuck in this body. I won't transition for others, I will do it for myself. Especially considering I'm nonbinary and there is nothing I can pass as, it's not like I'm going to fit in to society or whatever anyway.
If I had no human interaction I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself.
Well, yeah. In some ways, it would be way easier to transition if I didn't ever have to interact with anybody else.

It wouldn't do anything for my social dysphoria over being excluded from the sisterhood of women, but that wouldn't be any *worse* than I have it now, so...
Yes, but it would be easier meaning that I could transition to whatever stage  I want I guess. I wouldnt have the societal pressures of whats masculine or whats feminine like ""oh thats what a man does"" and vice versa. A lot of times when i think about transitioning I honestly feel like its heavily motivated by what society tells me what women ought to be and what men ought to be :/
Yes, I would too, I mean my psychiatrist asked me a similar question when I said I was trans he asked ""if everyone on the planet had no gender at all, including you, would you still want to transition?"" I mean, yes.
I agree, completely
Probably not. Because I wouldnt have people reminding me daily that how my body looks is what defines me.
100%. I'm myself no matter if there's other people around, I'm doing everything for me not for anyone else.  
if anything, would be even easier.
Yeah, I'm transitioning because my mind punismshes me if I don't and it gives me euphoria if I do so.
Oddly enough, that might actually make me feel able to transition.
Yes. I would 100% still transition.
Yes
No, I wouldn‚Äôt do anything. I wouldn‚Äôt be me if I couldn‚Äôt interact with anyone or has relationship. I would probably overdose or go clinically insane. I do transition because I relate to men as a woman. If I can‚Äôt talk to men again or have relationship with  anyone, I would like I said be clinically insane
Would still transition, even if id never see someone else again dysphoria wont leave me the fuck alone.
Would make it easier but also extremely difficult because I need people to talk to sometimes.
If you're talking about never interacting with any human (irl or through media) since birth, then most likely no. 
As there's no point of reference there's nothing transition into and no urge to do it. 

But if you're talking about no interactions with any human from now one, then definitely yes. I'm not transitioning for other people. I want to do it because I want my body to look a certain way. So as long as I can see my body I'll want to transition
Physically yes, socially... probably...the cloths are so much prettier. If anything, everything would be so much easier
I would definitely still transition. I see it as something I am doing 100% for myself because I deserve to represent that which is an essential part of my being in a physical manner. I deserve for the mental pains of dysphoria to go away and I will make it so.
We exist in reference to others. There is no self without how that self relates to other people and larger community and overall society. This is why solitary confinement is considered such horrible torture, it strips you of your own identity and feeling of existence. If I had never had a conversation with another person, I wouldn't have a conception of myself or a reference to compare myself agasint, much less a desire to transition.
This argument kind of erases people who are primarily socially dysphoric. Because the reality is we live in a society. And there is a variety of dysphoria. If I'm alone on an island there's no one there to tell me I'm not a man (ftm). There's no other men to compare to. There's no rules what a man is, how a man moves, what traits a man has, what hobbies a man likes. Of course you're valid in internal dysphoria and I acknowledge how difficult that is. But society forms a significant amount of the environment we move through in life and how we are perceived in that environment. There is a variety of dysphoria and I guess I'm saying this here because internal dysphoria is the only dysphoria I see acknowledged and I see this island scenario quite a bit.
I literally live alone in the woods. 

Answer is always yes.
I would have even less hesitation about it.
Absolutely!   I‚Äôm doing this for me‚Ä¶
Given that the biggest hurdle to me presenting as my gender in public right now is my fear of how I'll be treated...
Honestly I would rather kill myself then. I don't want to be a woman just to exist, I want to be a woman to live, love as woman, etc that all requires interactions.
Hell yes. My partner & I are aiming for living off grid eventually. My egg has only just cracked at 28 & I would 100% still be myself even if it was just for me.
Yes

This is not me
Yes
Yes. I am transitioning for me, not the world.
I feel like I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ be a lot more comfortable tbh. And I might not even really transition. I already fit the idea of ‚Äúme‚Äù, I guess, but I don‚Äôt fit the idea of me to anybody else. So I have to transition and look different and present differently to be that me to them, I guess? Thinking about this question actually answered a lot of questions about myself, so thank you. I‚Äôm ‚Äúhappy‚Äù as I am, just not happy about how I‚Äôm perceived.
Yup. I‚Äôm transitioning for me and nobody else. How other people see me or what they think of me is none of my damn business.
honestly even though i did interact with people throughout it i didn‚Äôt do it because of anyone but me in fact i did it despite several people. for me it‚Äôs always been about my mental health and my ability to feel comfortable in my own body and i think i‚Äôd do it again no matter what the circumstances
I'm transitioning for myself and for my own mental health; not for others. In fact, from a theory point, it would make this a lot easier. The fear of not knowing what will happen and believe it'll be always something bad...

I'll miss my good friend that at this point in my life I consider them really good ones and they're supporting a lot with this but I can deal with not speak with the rest of the world.
Well, no shit. Im not transitioning for other people.
Yes. I hardly socialization now, and i‚Äôm still transitioning
hell fucking yeah i already barely have human interaction
I would be more likely to transition. The fear of how others may react even violently and then being unable to hide my transness is something visceral that I'm considering now that my breast augmentation has been approved.
I may be in the minority, but I don't actually feel much disphoria from my interactions with others. It really is more about how I see myself, especially when I catch myself in the mirror on a bad day. So yea, have to agree, would still transition even if I never met another person, because it's about how I feel and what I see with my own eyes that matters
Harder yes
Not being a trans, I would have to support your position. As the mind is very powerful, snd if this what you need to complete yourself than do it.  Not as drastic as your transition, but I need to loose a 100#‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve done 150, with bariatric surgery, but that final 100#‚Äôs would leave me with too much excess skin, that I really don‚Äôt want to deal with.
Hell yeah, I‚Äôll destroy the universe to become the opposite gender
Makes me more likely to transition ngl
Yes. Whether I interact with others or not doesn't matter, at the end of the day my gender identity doesn't match the body I have
How would you get your pills, doctor recommendations, surgeries, hair removal, and advice if you have 0 human interaction? Gonna make your own pills? Perform your own bottom surgery? Even the trans community itself is ‚Äúhuman interaction‚Äù

Hate to say it but sounds like you genuinely rely on advanced modern society to get you to where you want to be; instead, why not say: ‚ÄúIf you never had any human interaction ever again, would you love yourself for who you are?‚Äù

If no, maybe seek some help frens
yes. i would.
This is actually one of my biggest (irrational) fears; that if I transitioned no one would talk to me for rest of my life, at least, not in a connected or meaningful way.
If I‚Äôm honest it‚Äôs one of my biggest hurdles.  I need people in my life.
I probably would. but at the same time I probably wouldn‚Äôt just because I don‚Äôt think I can really imagine a world without human interaction (at least online) I mean I ain‚Äôt a sociable girl AT ALL but loneliness is still a main factor on why I feel like shit all day so I probably would just feel very shitty all day and want to just lay down in bed. leading to eventually bot doing it
I dunno, picking between not transitioning and no human contact ever again is like picking between bubonic plague and cholera, both options suck and I probably wouldn‚Äôt live long either way
It would be hard for me to get the surgery I want without interaction with other humans but I absolutely would do it!
Oh hell yeah. 

Because then at least I wouldn't be paranoid people can read me. 

I wanna transition for me and me alone. These parts aren't mine and I especially don't wanna live with them if it's just gonna be me on my own. 

I'm the one who's gotta live with me and for me to fully enjoy thay that means transition even if I never talk to anyone ever again.
Idk how I'd get access to T or top surgery, but absolutely. It's for my own comfort more so than other people's
OMG, saaaame
Right? Literally all of my hesitation is around how other people will react.
Agree
Sooner? I think you mean right the fuck now
Yep, would have started like at 18 probably.
I think about this so often. I would have never detransitioned due to fear and I would have started transitioning way sooner
Came in to say exactly this. And in a way, of my three years transitioned, two have been during a pandemic where I don't really go out and do anything anyway...so that kind of did happen...
Same. I'm MTF pre everything. Still doubting about medical transition. But... If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, I would start hrt right now.
This 100%. As a person of mixed color who is acutely aware of most senses of ""passing"" are irrevocably entwined with whiteness, if I didn't have to interact with anyone ever again, it would make transition 1000 times less emotionally anguishing for me because I wouldn't be saddled with the fear of how I would turn out or be facing the terrifying reality that trans POC are killed at almost 10 times the rate of white trans people.
If I never had to deal with another human being my idea of femininity would become so abstracted I would never feel imposter syndrome. I would just change my body and develop habits and mannerisms that makes me feel better about myself
I just had this thought experiment internally while listening to a podcast about Castaway.

If I knew I'd be on a deserted island, and had a chance for any kind of prep or supplies, I would desperately try to make hormones one of those things. I want to be me, to grow toward me, like, as opposed to there *being no me*. 

Like, if it's gonna just be me, alone, damn straight I want to at a bare minimum feel like I *exist*.

Caverns of Socrates is a great metaphor. If that person who saw the true world was told they would be alone now, you can be damn sure they are going to pick bring alone while have sunshine on their face.
100%
I agree, for me. I feel a lot of the pressure to FULLY transition and do it quickly is from society as well. If I never had to talk to someone again, I‚Äôd probably just wear clothes I like more and act more like I want. I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about how others perceive my gender, only how I perceive myself.
Oh, I completely agree with that. Being seen, accepted and interacting with the world as a woman is a big part of my transition. But I wanted to make the point to my friend that a big chunk of why I'm transitioning has nothing to do with other people.
No, I get it. At one point in my 20s I cut off all human contact because so many of my 'friendships' were toxic...

I'm now married and have a small handful of friends, but I've maintained a lot of the boundaries that I set up after that dark time of my life.
THIS THIS THIS.   


I've just started my transition process (MtF), but this exact question has been nagging at me constantly now. I feel like I would LOVE to transition and be a woman in every stereotypical way, but then I realize that probably a large reason I feel that way is because I exist in a social world around humans. If it was just me alone in the wilderness I would just accept myself as human like you mentioned.   


This definitely makes me doubt myself, but I also have to accept that I don't live in a hypothetical and I will probably never be able to remove myself from some sort of societal interaction.
No, this is exactly the thought process I had.

I mean, its just me in the shower, so why do I avoid looking down?

Its just me in the mirror, so why do I avoid it?
No prob! It felt validating to me to explain it to my friend that way and seeing them nod in understanding.

Granted, for me, this is just part of why I want to transition. Another big part of it is to actually interact with others as a woman and be seen and accepted that way.
Ha! I was thinking that I could ditch all the effort I'm putting into voice training!
Nah, I wasn't assuming you're the last person on earth. I actually had it in my head that you'd just go about your life as normal, but just not have to talk or interact with anyone.
I actually came to the realization by asking myself of being a woman would make it easier for me to deal with others. A big part of my transition is to experience interacting with others as a woman, but I would totally transition if in total isolation as well.
I almost did because of human interaction...

I'm way better now...

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Not since birth, that's way too speculative as you'd never be able to predict how you develop mentally through childhood with no human contact (even if you could solve the practical problems like food, hygiene, medical care, etc).

And I don't even mean never seeing another person ever again (empty earth scenario). I just mean living without trying to form any relationships with other people, no conversations, no friendships, every interaction limited to the smallest, least amount. (This is based on a period of my life where I actually lived like this for a little over a year.)
I never said anything about an island, and didn't say anything about not living in a society. I know many commenters have made that assumption, but that's not where I was going.

I personally have lived times of my life completely socially isolated, by choice, because of not being able to properly socialize with people. I still struggle with it, and I believe a majority of the reasons for these struggles is that I was subconsciously a woman trying to interact with people but them seeing only an awkward man. While in college, I lived for over a year barely saying more than ""hi"", ""thanks"", ""yes"" or ""no"" to the various people that I had to interact with (clerks at a store, classmates, members of the public), and for those people I had to have more communication with (family, college professors, etc), I kept it as short as possible.
i think i mean 30 years ago lmao
Yes. I live here, not a hypothetical. So answering the question might give me a new perspective or an opportunity for self-reflection but ultimately transition is what I need here.
>i live here

YES! YES! THIS!!     
it doesn‚Äôt matter if we transition for societal reasons because *we live in a society!* it doesn‚Äôt matter that gender is a construct, because *the constructed thing has a function in the world we live in!* we‚Äôre playing by the rules of a game we can‚Äôt fully opt out of, and we‚Äôre exploiting the loopholes in order to live in a way that‚Äôs most comfortable and authentic to us. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
the thing is, though, it‚Äôs not *just* you in the mirror/shower. it‚Äôs also all the bagage/memories/assumptions/insecurities/messages from the outside world that you are bringing in with you in your alone times. you can‚Äôt fully separate yourself from it.

after being alone for a month, i‚Äôm pretty sure your mindset would change. (maybe not completely, but probably at least a little)
oops i replied to the wrong one lol
True.

I've been alone for extended periods of time. Before I realized I was trans, when traveling I would go days without seeing myself in a mirror, and completely enjoyed it, but I would still avoid looking at my own body when showering.

Since realizing I was trans and started transition, if I'm in a similar traveling situation, I find I occasionally want to look at myself in the mirror to see if I see him or her. Seeing her makes me feel good. Seeing him is jarring."	ski19k	trans	1015	0.99	2022-02-04 16:48:04

Duuude, thats awesome! Its a great feeling to use the proper washroom in publicü§ó
Oh I remember my first time. It was at a Walmart of all places and me and my brother went together. It made things way less scary. There was one other person in there that looked at me kinda funny but said nothing.

Now I don't even bat a lash at it haha Feels like home.  A much messier, smellier home.

That's awesome! I'm so happy for you dude! üòÅ

Yeah it‚Äôs gross right? Most of the time woman‚Äôs bathrooms are a lot less of a nightmare. That‚Äôs the main reason why I‚Äôm gender fluid./j
IM SO PROUD OF YOU MY MAN
LES GO
Duude sick!! Good for you! Shit is actually SO scary, people usually mind their own business from my experience, gendered bathrooms make me wanna combust. But using the men‚Äôs washroom feels really euphoric when you leave.
I used the women's room for the first time last month and it felt so nice.  Yay for you that's awesome
lol, welcome.
That's awesome sooo awesome
Wholesome award for you :D
Congratulations sweetie üòä I can't wait to finally see the secrets hidden in the girls bathroom for myself
Omg awesome!!!
That‚Äôs fantastic! How bad was it compared to the women‚Äôs? Like in terms of hygiene? I know the urinals make the place stink
YAY WE ARE ALL SO PROUD OF YOU! ITS SO HARD FOR ME TO GO INTO A MENS BATHROOM YOU‚ÄôRE SO BRAVE!
That‚Äôs great!
Now you can officially join the men's bathroom choir
Honestly I‚Äôm getting worried about the pandemic ending and having to start using the mens room. During the pandemic I started growing a beard on hormones and under the safety of a mask.  I still use the womens room because it feels safer and I‚Äôm nb so idk I feel like an imposter in the mens room even though I have a beard and got top surgery.  But once masks aren‚Äôt normal attire, I won‚Äôt have much of a choice because I‚Äôll get more judgement in the womens room than the mens :/ 
BUT IM SO HAPPY FOR YOU FRIEND!!
Hell yeah bruv ü§òü§òüôèü§òüëë
Congratulations:)
As a guy I could care less who is using the ‚Äúmen‚Äôs‚Äù room. Everybody shits. I don‚Äôt go in there to make eye contact or hold a conversation. Don‚Äôt be afraid.
Awesome. Mine was taking a big fat shit in a 100 degree bathroom under football stadium bleachers during marching band. It was a beautiful moment.
hell yeah bro! this was one of my biggest fears in public for a while, but once i did it i was so happy!
Congratulations man!
So proud of you! I did this for the first time a week ago too and it was exciting (and smelly lol)

Haha thanks ü•∞
Passing has a lot to do with genetics and what hormones are in your body, so from a facial standpoint there isn‚Äôt to do other then get hormones and get good at contour. But style and voice are also really important to how people perceive you. If you‚Äôre able to, do a bunch of online shopping and get a bunch of different clothes to see what you like and what looks nice on you (typically trans girls want to avoid off the shoulder stuff because we tend to have wider shoulders). If you don‚Äôt have a supportive family environment then everything is a bit harder especially now. If you need anything dm me üíï
Aww aha thanks üíïüíï
Yeah she never uses them so I‚Äôve taken them ü§´

Why are people in media more afraid of mtf than ftm?	Especially regarding bathrooms and clothing they always seems to have more of an issue than one or another	"because in transphobes minds, especially TERFs, trans men are victims, and trans women are predators.
It‚Äôs just 2 different types of transphobia ‚Äî- trans women are seen as predatory and trans men are seen as irrelevant/nonexistent
Because you surely ‚Äúcan‚Äôt take women seriously‚Äù even when they ‚Äúpretend to be men‚Äù. But ‚Äúmen who challenge masculinity‚Äù must not be! Outrage‚Ä¶blah blah üòë
Because trans women destroy their concept of men being the dominant gender. Because, ""why would anyone give up being a man to be a woman?"" It literally breaks their minds.
they have a worldview where they see men as predators and women as prey. so they they see ftms as women that have been ‚Äútricked‚Äù by the woke agenda or whatever and mtfs as men trying to enter women‚Äôs spaces to assault or ‚Äúerase‚Äù women or something
Sexism. Transmen are just helpless misguided women in need of rescuing from trans ideology.
Ah Ok I kinda understand it a bit better now. Thank you üò∫
I heard it on tik tok explained by a transmasc, and it makes sense. 
Everyone is right here. 
Trans women break cis aggressive straight men minds and are seen as predators. 
Trans men are infantilized and seen as victims
They think Trans women are men in dresses grooming children while Trans men are just confused women, and women are always harmless.
It's because the phobes see trans women as ""predatory men pretending to be women,"" and trans men as ""silly little girls trying to get power."" According to the bigots, masculinity is good, while femininity is bad. Them seeing ""men"" trying to disown their masculinity to ""become"" women is seen as wrong by them, but seeing ""women"" ""move up the ranks"" is seen as good. It's honestly a disgusting thought process. Just keep living as a trans person or ally, so we can slowly but surely stop this awful thought process.
Because they want to sell that trans men are small confused women who need help and that trans women are big scary men who will hurt someone, they use the patriarchy and harmful stereotypes to create more, even more harmful, and untrue stereotypes.
Because transphobes (esp terfs) see trans women as men, and all men are predators in their mind so trans women are evil. trans men are either non existent in their mind or poor little girls, victims of society‚Äôs sexism
Because the current discourse is that men are evil, don't you know? It's misandry to the max. And if trans women are former men, TERFs believe they are still beholden to all the shit they already think about cis men. But trans men are the opposite, and are really victims pulled into a delusion about male privilege.

I'm exhausted.
cause of penises
Because straight cis men aren't afraid of ""*accidentally* fucking another dude"" if the person they're with is already representing as a man.

The key is the ""accidental"", not the possibility of being aroused by another man. It's the whole ""how dare you put me in a position where I have to think about WHY *you*'re arousing *me*.  The cis men who are straight and homophobic don't want to have to think about whether or not the person they're undressing in their mind might have a penis or some other part that formerly was one.
I'm a cis male.  From my time in the navy, I can tell you.  Macho men are terrified of a challenge to their masculinity.  If they feel ""tricked"" by being legitimately attracted to a trans woman,  they will be chastised by their peers.  And the media is run by men.

Edit: The fear of trans women become a hate of trans women.
Some men can't wrap their head around the fact that they just might be attracted to someone with the same genitals, they think about what they want to do to women and therefore assume the position of ""this is what I'd do in a womens locker room so obviously that's what you're trying to do too."" And, ""I can't be placed in a position where I might hit on someone that was once male because I can't be bothered to question my own sexuality."" Flip side, ""Meh, lesbians are inherently hot so FTM doesn't even cross my radar."" Just what I've witnessed, not my opinion.
I guess since they see trans men as women they aren‚Äôt as threatened. My only guess is they see a trans women living her life and are just threatened by their agab. They have so many stupid ideas about how people with certain genitalia should act.
Because transphobic people believe that every man out there only does anything in order to get access to sexual partners, thus a ""man"" becoming a woman is doing it to gain access to women to have sex with.

This is why they ignore straight trans women so often too, many TERFs even have said they consider trans women with men as gay men who have fallen victim to comphet.
Its an extension of sexism. In their minds women are weak creatures who need protection and only exist to churn out more men. While men are supposed to be superior to women. To them transmascs were lured into transness by the desire to escape their sad destiny to pump out (preferably white) babies. On the other hand the idea someone who was born on the top of the social ladder deliberately climbing down must have malicious intentions and since they are lower and cant churn out babies they are worth less than nothing.
Edit: sorry for the essay i feel very strongly about this
Because they see us as our AGAB. And they are also sexist. So man is a threat and dangerous and woman is  fragile, weak and innocent. Also gender roles for men are way more strict. So it's easier to be ""masculine woman"" than ""feminine man"". 

Men go to toilet to pee and shit. Women act like public toilet were their personal living room.  They go to toilet to hang out, make up, gossip, take selfies etc. Men don't look each other in the toilet so they most likely don't notice if you don't fully pass. Women are very territorial and aggressive. Also it is that sexist idea that women need ""safe space"" in ""men's world"" because they are weak and fragile. 

I don't think many people are truly afraid. It's same as with female sports. Most of people couldn't care less. And that debate of trans lesbians. Those same people hate cis lesbians. But they know they have lost the war against gay people so they're willing to use anything they can to make our live harder.
They see trans women as men threatening cis women, but don't consider trans men to be women threatening cis men.
Cishet men are afraid of finding a trans woman attractive. If they do, it invalidates their  preconceptions and makes them confront their own gender/sexual identities. They see us as deceivers, sirens beckoning sailors to their demise. I couldn‚Äôt imagine being so insecure about my identity that I need to actively hate a group of people who are really only seeking what everyone else in this world is seeking: happiness, contentment, and peace of mind. Cisgendered people take for granted that their perception of their own gender rarely, if ever, is discordant with their assigned gender. If they could all feel that for one day, there‚Äôs be so much more support for us. Transphobes are so fragile that if they even consider an identity that does not fit into their narrow definition of gender, it might cause theirs to crack a little. They‚Äôd rather erase us from society instead of finding deeper understanding of themselves. This is not me saying they‚Äôd all become transgender, most of them wouldn‚Äôt, but they would be a lot more understanding and happier people.
Misogyny. Women are stereotyped as fragile and needing protection and are already wary of men. This makes it easier for conservative talking heads to fearmonger and manipulate them.
The lovely combo of transphobia and misogyny.
It‚Äôs because they have zero empathy, so they see trans women as men. And they know damn well that men are dangerous, so therefore fear trans women.
Idk I always thought it was the other way around
They hate us
Because as a mtf, you are purposely taking a step back in society out of your own free will. And that takes courage, that's what scares people the most.

That's just my point of view
In the minds of transphobes, trans women = men, and trans men = women, so trans women are scary and threatening men, and trans men are just confused little girls. Transphobes suck.
Transmasc men have both a curse and a blessing in being much less visible.

They don‚Äôt get to see themselves represented, which *sucks* as they deserve to see themselves, they do t get their issues taken seriously, which likewise sucks.

But are attacked less often.
Because ftm are just ‚Äúplaying dress up‚Äù
It‚Äôs about control. And controlling women more specifically. So men that are women, appear to be weak to men.
Extreme sexism on both ends. They don't see trans men as men, so they're clearly all the helpless, delusional victims of trans ideology. They don't see trans women as women, so they're clearly deceptive, aggressive men with a fetish.
The terf movement is picking up and they want to defend the ‚Äúhelpless poor women‚Äù or something weird like that. It all just goes back to gender stereotypes and misogyny
I just figured that since theyre obsessed with trans genitals, and penises are more intimidating-looking
Because in their minds ftm are women and women can't hurt people according to them, unless when they want to use cases of women who beat men just to ""destroy"" feminism
A lot of transphobia is based in misogyny. Women are seen as helpless, weak, and needing protection. Since transphobes see trans men as women, they aren't a threat. Instead, they are painted as easily influenced, confused girls who think they need to be like men to escape traditional femininity or feel special. Conversely, trans women are considered to be men. Men are thought to be more powerful, and masculine qualities more valuable. Misogynists can't understand why a man with more power would lower themselves to the role of a women. They are seen as predatory, a threat not just to women but the worldview of the misogynist.
Heya, thanks for asking the question.

 CIS straight woman here, what kills me about the media is that it feels like another way to put down women and pit woman against woman.

It strikes me as a new form of misogyny and and I'm really sorry that my trans sisters bodies are being put in the line. It's also a really dark way of telling women in general what defines us.
It is an extension of misogyny. Toxic masculinity doesn't see any afab as a threat regardless of what they do, but an amab who defies gender stereotypes is perceived as a threat to all men. MTF bear the brunt of the assault because they defy masculinity completely, but it is also extended to a lesser extent to male nurses, male housekeepers,  home makers, and other men who pursue less masculine roles.
In their minds, male = strong and female = weak. So then ftm is ‚Äúmoving up in the world‚Äù and they don‚Äôt understand why a mtf would want to ‚Äúpervert‚Äù their masculinity. The media has portrayed trans women as deceptive for decades, and conservative politicians play off of this narrative in order to create a moral panic about ‚Äúmen‚Äù trying to sexually assault women in the bathroom and trying to take over women‚Äôs sports, in turn rallying conservatives to vote for them
as of current, there's two major groups of transphobes: the ultraconservative/christo-fascist type (think matt walsh, ben shapiro) and the terfs (graham linehan, joanne, ...). these ideologies start out in pretty different places, but their reasons why trans women seem scarier than trans men kind of converge.

for the former, what they want is tradition/their interpretation of christian values. meaning women stay at home and take care of their children while the men work, with men having all the power. anything queer cannot exist in their ideal world as that'd be sinful to them. so they can paint trans women as scary - they're strong men who want to attack their weak women! - but the opposite argument for trans men doesn't work as a woman isn't a danger to men, women are weaker and powerless after all. that's why their narrative around trans men usually focusses on detransitioners and generally mourning those ""young women"" losing their ability to bree^(eeeeeeeeeeee)d.

terfs, instead, start out from the worldview a lot of second wave feminists have - men are the evil oppressors and the problem in society, while women are oppressed, this is how their world works and what defines those two genders. now, this is a gross oversimplification to begin with - it entirely fails to acknowledge the struggles men have due to the patriarchy - but what's relevant here is that this model of the world cannot cope with trans people's existence. 

for trans women, they can't understand why a man would want to give up his privilege and power, so the best explanation they can come up with is that trans women are men that chose a different way of oppressing women - by being bathroom menaces, sauna shockers or whatever else they come up with that week. now again, that explanation can't work with trans men - after all, men are the scary dangerous people and women are the ones who need protection, so like with the christofascists, they can't paint a trans man as a threat, instead choosing to view them as confused lesbians or women attempting to escape their oppression.

TLDR: a lot of ideologies boil down to ""men powerful, women weak"" and with that basis, you can't paint a trans man as a threat to cis men but can paint a trans woman as a threat to cis women.
Because insecure men freak out when they ‚Äúaccidentally‚Äù find us attractive
We face just as much violence but we‚Äôre seen as in need of fixing please don‚Äôt let this post turn into transmascs have it so easy because we don‚Äôt
They aren't, they just see us as an easier target
As a ftm it angers me that mtf don't get as much respect
Premeditated hysteria. Misogyny. Cis men in power hate women. (Generalization‚Ä¶whatever.) A trans woman is a slap to manhood. A slap to this unwavering thing that is their identity. Trans men blend in a lot easier. I know some who are stealth through and through cause the got treated like shit.

Bottom line‚Ä¶ whatever it actually might be from person to person‚Ä¶ Trans women are easy targets.
Right now it‚Äôs about prisoners and who gets housed where.
I‚Äôve always thought this. As a trans man, most of the other trans men I‚Äôve met have been bigoted, harassed people, and been just as cruel as a lot of cis men, but I‚Äôve only had one negative encounter with a trans woman, and even then, she detransitioned, so it‚Äôs not like that reflects all trans women?
Because bigots see trans men as ""women *pretending* to be men"".

Meanwhile they see trans women as ""men who gave up their privilege and power to play dress-up"".

Therefore they have more respect for trans men because in their eyes, at least they're trying  to be the ""correct"" gender.

TL;DR bigots gonna bigot.
Scare tactics and it‚Äôs easier to prey on the (very real and valid) fears of women when it comes to ‚Äúmen‚Äù being in their private spaces. It‚Äôs gross honestly.
I think it may be because sometimes transwomen don't pass as well. Testosterone effects their voices, gives them an adams apple, changes their face shape, and body build. If they only take hrt a while after male puberty, then although estrogen does a lot, some things won't change unless they get expensive surgeries and train their voices to speak in higher pitch. On the other side, transmen going on hrt end up passing better because their bodies do physically change more, facial hair grows, adams apple appears and voice deepens.

This is obviously not the only reason that transphobia is more towards transwomen but I think it is a considerable factor as ""they are easier to identify"".
misogyny. Some see trans men as confused or tricked lesbians, though some terfs actually support trans men. They cant believe that anybody would want to be feminine since being feminine has been so ostracized in pop culture with terms like ""soyboy"" and in conservative circles is seen as such a bad thing, that they think that trans women dont actually see themselves as/want to be women, and are instead faking it ti gain access to womens spaces and assault them. the whole ""erasure"" theory is a bit of a lighter take on that in that generally people that espouse it have accepted that trans women see themselves as women, but they dont see them as women so they think its problematic an attack on womens rights that trans women get to take a shit in the bathroom, or yknow, exist. While both are quite stupid and harmful to trans women, i think it is important to acknowledge that the whole ""erasure"" idea becoming more popular than the seeing trans women as predators idea *is* a very slight step forward in terms of acceptance, even though it isnt acceptance of trans women in any stretch, and still leads to violence against trans people, and people that believe in it generally still harrass trans people whenever they come across them
TERF ideals I guess (in the UK especially)
Yep we are all predators with mental health problems , apparently a simple visit to psychiatric doctor will fix all our gender issues
because to some we are still women, and god forbid women have the power to be considered a threat
Sexism
They see trans men as women and believe they can control them like they (believe) they can with cis woman. Plus, it's a lot harder to fear mongers against trans men. Most of them probably couldn't find a trans man if they tried.

But for trans women, especially early in transition, it's a little harder for some of us to look fem. Plus, it plays into one of the only groups they are gaining ground with to come after us. But because that group(turfs) actually have no idea what they are talking about, they mostly ignore that teans' men exist, so so do the media.


Edit to add that they do sometime talk about trans men, but I had purged it from my mind because of how insane it sounds. A lot of the talk about trans men is how ""these girls have been tricked into thinking they are boys"" as if afab peps can make a disison about who they are or what they want.
misogyny
sexism says men are stronger than women naturally, transphobia says trans women are men

it's just reporposed sexism, but this time it's disguised as feminism
right wingers hate amab people more than they claim leftists too, that‚Äôs the conclusion i‚Äôve come to tbh.
See the Diaclosure Documentary
Because people are stupid and don't understand
Cause we have weenies. And men do more assault than women so they see us as a dangerous group of people. 

It‚Äôs also a power thing, men want women to be below them/ sub/ under their control, and a trans woman has the power of a man inside them. We know what‚Äôs unjust because we know what full rights used to feel like as men. And then stepping into a female role/ life and seeing the unfairness and sexism causes us to speak up and out about it. That‚Äôs my hot take
Because transphobes-specifically TERFs but still-believe that there is a Perpetrator gender and a Victim gender. There's no in-between, and a Perpetrator can't transition into a Victim because they're always going to have the mindset and instincts of a Perpetrator. A Victim *can* transition into a Perpetrator, but then they're horrible nasty gender traitor monsters who deserve to be shot.

A lot of the media focus is on trans women and transfeminine, yes, because to transphobes, having a vagina makes you a Victim and having a penis makes you a Perpetrator, so Perpetrators are 'invading' Victims' spaces and safety, because everyone in the Perpetrator gender is INHERENTLY dangerous and violent and immoral, whereas the people in the Victim gender are all weak and helpless.

But a lot of the legislation surrounding specifically medical transitioning is focused on trans men and transmasculine people, because a trans woman, to these guys, is just a Failed Man. But they can't ever Not Be Men so they can be turned back. They're Perpetrators, like all men, and transphobes believe that you can't un-become a Perpetrator. 

But a trans man is a RUINED Woman, and the right wing-and yes, as far as I'm concerned, if you're a transphobe, you're right-wing-***need*** to control women's bodies, because they're the Victim gender and the Victims must be controlled. They don't want women, especially young girls and teenagers, to 'ruin' their bodies, which means 'becomes unable to become breeding stock'.
Because they don‚Äôt see them as women. They see them as predatory men - probably because they can‚Äôt imagine biological men *not* being predatory.
You see it most in the bathroom arguments.  Except as soon as one of those bigots sees someone like Buck Angel walk out of the bathroom their daughter is in, there's going to be violence.
Most likely because they still view trans women as men. And therefore, if there's a trans woman (which I don't know how you'd know, but whatever), they still view them as a man (because ""you couldn't possibly actually identify as that""). Also, same thing with viewing them as men, there's the foolish argument that trans women are stronger than regular women, but there are plenty of women stronger than men, and they're still viewed as women.TLDR; they've bigots who aren't willing to change their minds.
Transmisogyny
Bc they see ftm as women taking a wrong path and think we need to be rescued. Its a weird combination of sexism and transphobia I think.
I think people in media may be more afraid of MTF individuals because they often face more discrimination and negative stereotypes in society. This can lead to fear and misunderstanding, which can then be perpetuated in the media. However, it's important to remember that both MTF and FTM individuals deserve equal respect and acceptance. As for the issue of bathrooms and clothing, I believe everyone should have the right to use the bathroom and wear the clothing that aligns with their gender identity, regardless of whether they are MTF or FTM. It's important to create inclusive and safe spaces for all individuals.
misogyny, terf ideology, anything of that sort. they view men as scary and dominant and women need to fight back. since they don't see us as our genders all they see are ""men"" invading women and ""women""  running away to be a man to escape misogyny
They think trans women are predators and ‚Äúpushing their fetishes onto children‚Äù and that trans men are just confused women who are just tomboys in denial ‡≤†_‡≤†
Misogynyyyyyyyyyyyyyy
because we're only confused silly little women /s
Because they infantilise transmen were just women who were too scared to be women and we were manipulated by the woke left into thinking we‚Äôre men ü§¢
because TERF. Men are evil, women are innocent victims. the gender binary is ""predator and prey"". And since they believe this is an immutable biological fact, they don't see trans women as women and instead view them as men trying to sneak into women's spaces to rape women. 

Trans men on the other hand are confused girls who have been manipulated into mutilating their bodies by the evil trans agenda. 

amab trans people receive demonisation, afab trans people receive infantilisation, and therefore you see more shit about how dangerous trans women are, because the hate afab trans people get tends to be quiet, in the background, but no less debilitating.
Transmisogyny.
A lot of transphobes only experience of male to female people through movies and TV (Mrs. Doubtfire, Tootsie, etc.) In most of those circumstances, there‚Äôs always an ulterior motive for the man to pretend to be a woman. It doesn‚Äôt cross their mind that there isn‚Äôt an underlying motive.
because according to them us trans guys are either irrelevant bc it doesn't back up their argument of trans people being predators, or we're just poor innocent brainwashed babies and 'lost sisters'
Because it fits the masquerade of defending women. 

The core reason that such rampant hatred is even considered is because it's dressed up as protecting women. Using that narrative men are all evil and women are all victims. 

Applying this to Trans people they see Trans women as men (evil) and Trans men as women (victims). So not only do they manage to make trans women and male allies the villains they also solidify their argument that Trans men are just victims of the Trans agenda. 

The simple formula is to speak about a subject noone would dare disagree with, so with JKR you have womens rights and safety, while on the other side like the Sigma male influencers use male mental health. Base the majority of your points on agreeable topics so you can slowly spirnkle in more and more terrible shit. Just like a certain painter in the 1930s when he took up politics.
According to Julia Serano (the trans woman who wrote *Whipping Girl*, a great academic book about trans-feminism), there is nothing scarier for society than someone born male who ""willingly"" gives up their masculine privilege and their dominant place in society. 

And because ppl absolutely want to know the reason why trans women and AMAB enbies would give up their masculinity, they assume the worse (that, for example, trans women transition just to predate on women and children)
The reason imo is rooted in gender stereotypes, sexism and transphobia. There's 2 reason imo:
- ftm are usually more masculine then mtf are feminine. This stems from gender stereotypes, especially regarding bone structure which is more important to appear feminine, while for FtM bodily and facial hair and lower voice are a stronger are the most defining feature of a men, and while testosterone alone has usually great effect in achieving this masculine traits mtf HRT can do little to nothing for the traditional male bone structure, which means that FtM usually pass much more as ""small guys"" (pardon the definition, I know full well that you're beautiful and strong males) and draws much less attention then mtf. It is more difficult for an MtF to appear feminine (for my absolute sadness) and MtF are recognized as ""wolfs in sheep's clothing"" because everybody is used to males being untrustworthy, predators and a danger to females.
- conversily even when an FtM can be easily recognized as being born female the gender stereotype is that the female is innocent and can do no harm, and the FtM is seen as female so it can do no harm. This is also for cis women, mind you, a cis man can never enter a female bathroom but it is acceptable for women to use the men bathroom, especially when they aren't separated in 2 different rooms and the women's is occupied.

I want to point out that I absolutely not condone this stereotypes.

TL;DR: FtM pass better than MtF, and even when they don't the society view women as less dangerous then men.
Because people see ftm as a female who is harmless because they are female. A mtf is seen as not harmless but dangerous because they are male. It's the same way with gay men being seen as dangerous while lesbians are seen as harmless. It is a form of hate based  sex. I don't think there is even a word for it. I  am sorry this exists. I am sorry. Cis 67f
its because trans women are hypervisable, while trans men are invisible.
It's simple misogyny mixed with transphobia I think. Trans men are infantalised and seen as ""confused little girls"", whilst trans women are seen as predators who want to ""pray on little girls"". It's seriously disgusting in both ways.
They are worried about us too, but it is easier to just not acknowledge we exist. The abortion bans affect us. The new testosterone scheduling bullshit affects us. Most of us have the ability to get pregnant and most of us have no interest in doing that, and that is seen as a threat.
Since man are seen as stronger, if a trans man 'invades' man only spaces it's their own choice, but when a trans women goes to women spaces they're inflicting themselves onto other women.

Women are seen as the weaker sex, and man as the stronger. So when someone ""who's naturally stronger invades weaker people's spaces"", they're a danger and should be feared/casted out/banned in the name of self-protection 

It's othering. Othering and fear mongering because the people who say those things don't know any trans women.
Im ln Germany some of us name them Trans Exclusionary Radical Fascist, because they often have links in the far right scene, use right speech terms and the zones between them are really slim and Terfs use a lot of antisemitism dogwhistles or are openly antisemitic.
Because deep down people are all misandrists. They hate men, and see them as inherently violent and aggressive. Not just TERFS, conservatives and rightoids especially, they just think that it's acceptable, while TERFS don't.

It's hard for them to imagine a man doing anything feminine or ""unmanly"" out of the pureness of his heart for them.

To them, men are inherently evil and dangerous and predatory. 

And on the inverse, trans men (who they see as women), are fragile little angels who have been misguided and led astray. Because they see women as creatures with no real autonomy, and also because they want to preserve the breedability of teenage girls.
The anti-trans hate machine attacks us in different ways.

Trans women are demonized as scary dangerous monsters who have to be destroyed, while trans men are infantalized as stupid brainwashed little girls who have to be ""saved"".

They start with the presupposition that nobody really needs to transition.

Because trans women and AMAB nonbinary people are imagined to really be men, they're portrayed as self-directed evil sexual predators who have to be utterly rejected and cast out of society to protect ""real"" (cis) women and girls. And trans women are hyper-sexualized, depicted as being predators threatening cis women on one hand and as being a kinky novelty fuck for cis men on the other.

This combination of sex and danger in public portrayals of trans women gets a lot of page-clicks, which means it gets a lot of attention from news and social media.

Meanwhile, trans men are perceived as lost, confused, vulnerable girls who are only transitioning because we've been brainwashed/groomed/forced into the evil Trans Cult of mutilation and death. We get shit like that disgusting book *""Irreversible Damage: The Transgender Craze Seducing Our Daughters"".*

Because we're imagined to really be women we're portrayed as easily manipulated child-like victims who have to be ""saved"" before medical transition ruins us.

And trans men are completely de-sexualized, and dismissed as being somewhere between a butch lesbian and a eunuch. Trans men who have medically transitioned to the point that they are no longer seen as desirable to straight men are seen as ""fallen women""; pathetic, grotesque, ruined females beyond hope of redemption.

We are depicted as being neither threatening nor desirable, and dismissed as pathetic and beneath contempt.
Personally i think most people dont notice ftm.

Women are also more vocal, so hints why you probably see more mtf on any platform :)
And when either of the two are able to go in stealth, conform heavily to gender roles, and are more conventionally attractive than their cis counterparts, god help them if someone finds out they‚Äôre trans. Cus then they‚Äôll experience hell on earth for ‚Äútricking people.‚Äù
TW
It's because they still think that trans men are ""women"", and in their little minds women = weak, or not dangerous at all. it's the opposite with trans women
Because we're more threatening
Like Gen X, the media forgets that Trans men exist.
Visibility, for one thing. Sheer numbers. Plus, stories like Dana Rivers.
I don't think many people take transmen seriously. I'm a trans dude, and many people think we're just playing dress-up. I haven't met anyone who thinks that an evil transguy will do something terrible to a cisman.
Transphobia, misogyny, racism and on and on and on, basically terfs will have a million and one reasons to hate trans women and none of them are valid or make sense to me but I guess I‚Äôll never know because I‚Äôm not an ignorant person.
Quite simply, the passing of FtM is simply better. When testo is taken, the person masculinizes very quickly, so that it is no longer visible.
Vagina equals victim, penis equals predator in their simple minds.
This is the answer right here.
Sorry for the dumb question. What is a TERF?
Yup it‚Äôs that special combination of misandry and misogyny.  The same people who think trans women are predators think trans men are poor little brainwashed victims.
Or ""lost sisters""
It's the same thing where they were saying gay men were going to assault children but never talked about gay women, as they were just confused. But a guy is afraid of another guy looking at them the way they look at women. 

Their mentality: men want to pretend to be women so they can go into women's  lockers and be pervs. Same with bathrooms. It's bullshit but it comes from ""this is what men are, trans people aren't real, so it must be for evil."" 

A woman pretending to be a man isn't doing it to be a perv, they are doing it to reap the benefit of being a man. So of course there isn't any concern.
Yep they broke the bro code in the most serious way. They truly unbro'd. It's sacrilege to the Patriarchy and its pantheon of gods, like the eldritch horror of tess-toss-tose and god of sweaty sports broseidon. The Patriarchy runs secret groups like bropus dei, to thwart humans from transitioning and keep society locked in a bondage of fixed identity.

Do keep in mind folks this is all just humor... maybe.
Explains the reactions I‚Äôve been getting in job interviews. It‚Äôs subtle but at times you can catch it slipping through.
And it's even sadder because every trans woman I've met loves femininity more than most cis women I know! Why would we want to erase the coolest thing in the world!?
Still rather depressing in outlook
Fr fr tho misogyny after you start passing as mtf is pretty intense üíØüíØ
If we could only get towards the direction of respect. 

We have to deal with outright hate and intolerance, and with the media fueling the fire, some are under direct attack.
Damn, so sorry you've had that experience with other transmasc people. I know what you mean tho, as a trans man myself I have had quite a few more unfortunate encounters with transmascs than transfems. We got unlucky
This. This is the one. Bioessentialism and misogyny all in one real shitty package.
Yup üíØüíØüíØ
But honestly 99% of violent and sex crimes are committed by cis men with penises
it‚Äôs actually Trans exclusionary radical feminist (the exclusionary is that they don‚Äôt accept trans women as women)
Trans exclusive radical feminist (even tho you could argue that they are not really feminists). Someone being transphobic to ¬´¬†protect women‚Äôs rights¬†¬ª
>poor little brainwashed victims.

THIS PART is what really gets me. That disgusting infantilization. The smug assumption that trans men are actually just silly widdle girls with unfortunate, tragic ideas in their widdle heads, the poor lost lambs. It makes me want to tear my hair out. Sometimes it feels like being mansplained to all over again, but now it includes cis women.
I love the eccentric wording on this that feels more than a typical comment feels.
It is and sadly only getting worse.
It is, and what we're seeing lately is the mere tip of an EXTREMELY depressing iceberg.
Ikr. It‚Äôs sad that so many trans men begin to act just like the cis men who treated us so horribly. The amount of transphobic FTMs is upsetting.
Indeed, it‚Äôs more about the generalization that the genitals make the person, not what the person chooses to do with their genitals.
Cis women actually commit a lot more sex crimes than what the statistics show though. Its just often not as severe because of the power imbalance in mens favor, and sex crimes/harrassment committed by women is not seen a crimes in many cases. I am mtf and I have experienced assault/harrassment by cis women both as a child and as an adult. Being closeted growing up, my male friends as a teenager all had stories of adult cis women having been inappropriate with them. It is fairly common for 12-13-14 year old boys to have their sexual debut with a much older cis woman as well. It just never gets reported because it is not seen as a crime, and it is extremely difficult for the victims to be taken seriously, so the statistics doesn't reflect it.
I am not religious in the least. But preach
yes, but what terfs are claiming is that 99% of people with penises are committing the violent and sex crimes
They don‚Äôt accept trans men as men, either. They welcome them into their special ‚Äúwomen‚Äôs spaces‚Äù because to them, that‚Äôs what they are.
i consider the F in TERF to stand for fascist
That's where the term FART comes in ""Feminism Apropriating Radical Transphobe.""
Exactly.  And it‚Äôs the opposite of the lived experience of many trans men.  Like for me my first inklings that I was a boy came when I was toddler and then hit a high when I was going through puberty and adolescence but societal influences made me think this was just not possible.  I grew up with no representation to look toward and in school I was categorized with girls on a daily basis, so I convinced myself that my feelings must be wrong and I pushed them deep down.  I was in denial for decades.  

I‚Äôm 36 yo and going to my first HRT appointment on Monday (yay!) after over a year of soul searching.  I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm here, but I‚Äôve spent this past year working hard on undoing the societal brainwashing that I went through when I was growing up.
True!! I am mtf so I dont know how it feels to be infantilized to that degree, but I feel with trans-men that have to hear this every single day.
Yay! I have eccentric wording, but in a positive way. Best thing reddit told me all day. I'll take it!


*Does the snoopy happy dance down the sidewalk*
Yeah, now it‚Äôs moving to the ‚Äúdegenerate freaks‚Äù and a ‚Äúcancer to society that must be eradicated‚Äù type fascist shit.

Ugh I fucking hate this world. At least more cis people are catching on that it‚Äôs so much worse than they thought
Close to home this hits
I was sexualy harassed by a cis woman at a public swimming pool when I was 15 years old. I still don't like going to public swimming pools 30 years later.
Fair
Agreed. Remember that protest in Melbourne where Nazis helped the TERFs?

My school makes me use the girls bathroom. I‚Äôm a trans guy and they know it.	"So I‚Äôm a trans guy, and I came out to the school last year. My principal was very kind and let me use the boy‚Äôs bathroom.

But this year, she left, and we got a new principal, who KNOWS  that I am transmasc.

So when I ask her if I can use the boy‚Äôs bathroom because I am trans, she tells me no, because my dad is unsupportive and they don‚Äôt want to deal with parent complaints.

AITA for being PISSED OFF?

Edit: I live in NYC, and we DO have a gender-neutral bathroom, BUT IT IS COMPLETELY UNSANITARY. There was no lock for a month, the seniors vape there, and it‚Äôs in the basement so it‚Äôs a hassle walking all the way down then back up again.

Edit 2.0: THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH.
My idea is to use the girls bathroom with a big sign saying: I am a boy. This is the principal‚Äôs fault. So wish me luck!!"	"You're absolutely right to be pissed off. What a coward of a principal.
I've dealt with teachers and school staff members like that and I basically just ignored them, it's not like they can physically stop me from using the bathroom because they legally aren't allowed to put their hands on me
Sometimes it‚Äôs better to ask for forgiveness than for permission
I don't know what laws apply here, but my company has a policy that says that I have the right to access restrooms that match my gender identity. I raised concerns as a non-binary person, and they are installing signage and locks to turn 2 existing restrooms into gender-neutral restrooms.  


If I was in your shoes, I'd just go into the bathroom and make them suspend you. You'd probably win that lawsuit easy.
Why ask? Just use the proper restroom.. maybe I‚Äôm just missing something though so feel free to correct me if I‚Äôm wrong in this thinking
Hey friend,

Some folks have chimed in here already with some nefarious and confrontational ideas. While there's a time and a place for those actions, I think the best thing you can do right now is quietly continue using the boys room. In NYC I would doubt any students will complain much, and if they do that's not your problem, it's theirs and the school's. 

You should also prepare yourself with carefully thought out responses in case they do take further action to try and stop you from using the correct bathroom. For example, offering you, a guy, the all-gender or single-occupant restroom instead is not only insulting because of the restroom's condition, but also fundamentally flawed reasoning. It's great that they have such restrooms for those who need it, but they also have a plain old run of the mill boy's room and you have equal right to use it. If they don't let you use the boy's restroom they're saying you're not a boy and that's transphobic and discriminatory. To my knowledge that's also illegal in NYC:
 https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/media/single-sex-restrooms.page#:~:text=It%20has%20been%20illegal%20in,access%20to%20bathrooms%2C%20since%202002.

I'm not sure what the situation is with your father but the school should not give a fuck. They definitely don't need to report to him which bathroom you use, and like I said, I believe it would be illegal for them to ban you from the men's room because your father requested it. The law is the law, and the law states you ""go"" where YOU say you're supposed to go. Period.

Also, just as a general tip for when you inevitably have to have more of these conversations: avoid using words like ""preferred restroom"" or ""restroom of your choice"" etc. On those same lines try to refer to yourself as a ""trans guy"" as little as possible. I feel like this applies mostly for people who are binary trans, but it may help for non-binary people in some situations. Discredit their attempts to exclude you from ""guys/boys/men"" and their arguments against you using the boys room will become way less comfy. Reframing ""preferences"" as rights and expectations will limit their opportunities to try and negotiate with you (e.g. gender-neutral restroom). 

Best of luck to you, and I hope at least some of what I say may be useful. Feel free to reach out to me if you need anything! :)

‚ù§Ô∏è *Bella [edit: can't spell my own name lol]
Use the bathroom you want. Fight it
Here is the problem: they can always claim that the gender-neutral bathroom is there, so what‚Äôs the problem. So you can never win that fight.

That means your fight is with the state of that bathroom and its accessibility. Does the school want to make you feel uncomfortable by not applying the same supervision and cleaning routine to your bathroom and by letting you walk to hide your toilet use in the basement?!? These are the kinds of arguments that you can win.

And as sad as it is: little wins are wins. So if they needed to take effort cleaning and supervising your bathroom that would be a win from my perspective.
You probably should have not asked the new principal. After all the ruling had already been made. After you have used your bathroom of choice for long enough. It would have been seen as normal to most. It would have been a lot harder to turn you down. As you have an earlier ruling in your favour, you have been using the bathroom for an extended period of time without issues. So action would have only been needed if you were refused use.
That's really fucking screwed up, I'm so sorry you have to experience that üò≠ <3
Could go with the petty revenge tactic and start strongly hitting on the girls in the restroom ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Would they rather piss of one parent or all the girls and all their parents?  Very verypetty move I know...but it'd probably work
We should have some state laws that make this illegal. If you're over 16, you should be able to fill out this form without parental involvement that basically states the school has to provide the accomodations you request. I had one filled out at my school
Fellow New york transmasc, I believe in NY there's a rule that faculty MUST let trans students into the bathroom they identify with. Im not fully sure so don't quote me on it.
Edit: my grammar T-T
They don't want you using the right bathroom? Fuck it. Use the wrong bathroom. Make everyone uncomfortable. Make sure they know whose to blame. they think it's not their problem because it only affects you?? Fuck that. Make it their problem.

 Be gay do crimes‚úä
Slowly take a brick FROM THE SAME WALL each day. Make sure the school doesn‚Äôt collapse just steal a fucking wall
How is the social sentiment at your school? If your peers generally support you, it might be easier just to use the restroom you've been using (and have a right to use) and not worry about it. Get people to rally behind you if you have to and make it weird for staff for forcing a boy to use a different bathroom. I can just imagine school kids booing a staff member and making them feel awkward like ""What the fuck X is a boy don't make him go in the girls' bathroom you fucking freak.""

If people suck where you are, start googling about laws. You might have some protection afforded. Going this route might get the results you want, but come with stupid social consequences.

Regardless, I am sorry and shit'll get better when you get older and have more freedom to pick and choose your environment. I suffered a lot early-on, and now I rarely even think about it.
bruh who cares if you use the boys‚Äô bathroom. if anything it‚Äôs worse because you‚Äôre a man in a woman‚Äôs bathroom and that is typically frowned upon.

I mean it‚Äôd be chill if you were like ‚Äúit was just a rumor. I‚Äôm literally amab. I will be using the boys bathroom.‚Äù
Just go,
and if they want to hinder you, just pee on the floor right in front of who hinders you.
Then blame them for not letting you onto the toilet stripping a basic human right from you.
They litterally have no right to choose on which toilet you go.
This is bad advice.
Disable the other bathrooms so that the rest of the school is forced to also use the one gender-neutral bathroom and see what you are subjected to go through first-hand. It does not take much creativity to ruin the plumbing system for a few days, and given that its America, who knows how long it will take for the school to fix the public bathrooms. Silly disobedience like that can be a good strategy if you feel safe engaging in that behavior.
Uhhh, according to the signs all over my college in front of every restroom (also in NYC) this is actually fucking ***illegal.*** 

Here is [NYC's website, stating that this has, in fact, been illegal since 2002.](https://www.nyc.gov/site/cchr/media/single-sex-restrooms.page)

They have to let you use the men's room. It's the law. If they don't let you, they're breaking the law. It's that simple. Would your principal rather deal with parent complaints or lawyer complaints? 

Just some fun questions to ask anyone who tries to stop you the next time you go to use the men's room. 

Seriously OP, I would keep this website bookmarked on your phone to show any teacher or administrator who tries to stop you. On top of just being a bad policy, you live in an area of the world that condemns not letting trans people use their correct bathroom. They aren't protected, you are. 

Not an asshole, just a law-abiding citizen.
Just use the bathroom you want. Local, state, and federal law is on your side. If your new principal wants to fight this, it‚Äôs going to be expensive hill for them to die on.
Confidence is really important. You could have told the new one ""just so you know I'm using the guys bathroom, like I have until now"". Maybe easier said than done but I'm in university and confidence is rewarding
First, documents. You want their statements written and signed. Use the boys bathroom if you want. If anyone tries to stop you, tell them that you have the same right to the bathroom as any of the other boys. Your parents included. Gavin Grimm's transphobic school district appealed to the Supreme Court and was denied.
Get EVERY interaction between you and this principal written down just in case.
You should be upset about this.  The principal can not stop you from using the restroom of the gender you identify with if you are in NYC public school (private is a different story). See the ""Restrooms and Locker Rooms"" section of the NYC Schools website for the official policy.  [NYC Schools Transgender Guidelines](https://www.schools.nyc.gov/school-life/school-environment/guidelines-on-gender/guidelines-to-support-transgender-and-gender-expansive-students)
Schools just won‚Äôt take a complaint. Same bs happened to me except in reverse
https://www.nyclu.org/sites/default/files/Transgender_Students_Rights_and_Schools_Responsibilities.pdf

According to this, they can‚Äôt prohibit you from using the boys‚Äô bathroom (from the NY Civil Liberties Union).
Alastronoria is disappointed
That‚Äôs awful I‚Äôm so sorry. I know where I‚Äôm from, schools have laws that students can use the bathroom that affirms with the gender.
Ughhh‚Ä¶ so annoying that people can‚Äôt take a piss without someone starting something. Keep using the men‚Äôs. People will always complain about us. Their problem, not ours
If you pass really well, you could make the argument that you make the girls uncomfortable being in their bathroom.
What a coward of a principal! üôÑ
Why/how would your dad know what bathroom you use and why would u even need to ask permission to use the restroom you are most comfortable going in to PEE
Why are you asking?? just use the men's restroom
Do it anyway. Fuck them. Go where you‚Äôre comfortable.
I may be wrong, but isn‚Äôt there a US law that says you can‚Äôt be denied access to your preferred bathroom?
Is your school public or private? In NYC being trans is considered a part of a protected class and the law is on your side. I don‚Äôt know if it will apply to private institutions though.

https://www.nyc.gov/office-of-the-mayor/news/961-15/nyc-commission-human-rights-strong-protections-city-s-transgender-gender
Use the boys bathroom anyway
Don‚Äôt ask. Just do it. When they decide to do something about it, you‚Äôll have standing. At that point they‚Äôre denying you your title IX protections. You can take it to court and win. This is assuming you‚Äôre in the US.
You will learn in life that sometimes it's better to ask forgiveness than permission.
Harass cis girls just to mess with the transphobes' heads (jk)
Thats why i go into the men bathroom so i dont get a handbag smashed in my face the teachers are fine with me beeing the way i am but the others are not
Id say fuck your to the school and use the boys restroom anyways. What are they gonna do? Send you home? Like alright whatever
NTA. You're a guy. You should be able to use they guys bathroom.
Use the bathroom on the principal‚Äôs desk
[removed]
I do have a genuine question. I've recently come out publicly as trans and I'm still confused on the whole bathroom thing. I don't understand why it matters what bathroom we use?

The bathroom is there for us to Pee or poop, which can be done in any bathroom. Also I don't look at people when I walk into the bathroom so I don't really care who walks in regardless of gender identity. I go in, pee, walk out and continue about the day.

I understand that without a high level of Dysphoria I don't have the same point of view you do, so I'm just curious why which gender bathroom used become so big in the Trans community when it's just a room you're in for only 1-5 minutes usually. Whether I'm surrounded by men or women in the bathroom, I'm minding my own business and not paying attention to them anyways
[removed]
You are absolutely right to be annoyed. Your principal does not have your back; your principal has zero right to tell you that you cannot use the toilet ‚Äî if you are comfortable going in, I would just go into the mens toilets and make a stand.
That‚Äôs not right! Use the one you wish where you feel most comfortable. Don‚Äôt ask. It‚Äôs none of their business.
i identify as unlabeled but my parents don‚Äôt know and the school doesn‚Äôt know i use any bathroom i want ( i typically use girls or unisex bathrooms but if i have i will use the mens) i live in Oregon and i know if they say anything they would be in huge trouble but i agree the single use bathrooms are kinda gross because people vape and have sex in them but i find them easier to use because they are bigger and the other bathrooms stalls are tiny
You should just go to the boys bathroom and bring a friend if you can in case a teacher gives you shit and if someone is standing  up for you more ppl are likely to do it as well. Also optics you should make sure your classmates are talking about how transphobic she is
My school tried making me use a private staff restroom, but since I pass to most of the staff and students I just use to the men's anyways. But Michigan (my home) is also pretty cool when it comes to transgender rights. I don't know what you're legal rights are.
You‚Äôre well within your right to be pissed off. Write a formal complaint to the principles superintendent/and send a copy to the local media. If your dad isn‚Äôt supportive why does he have to know what bathroom you use? It doesn‚Äôt make logical sense‚Ä¶ ~_~
OP, you should look this over if you have to fight them on this.

I would also contact the ACLU of NY if they give you shit. Make it enough of a burden for them that they stop.

Yeh id be pissed too. The whole bathroom debate has annoyed me for a long time. You should beable to use whatever bathroom that alines with your gender (gender is not the same as sex. Sex is biological and completely unrelated). But for some reason this is frightening to people. 

They thow around inane anecdotes like the whole ‚Äúbathroom rapist‚Äù BS and such. I dont think thats what their really worried about tho. I think its just a biggoted excuse they use so they can continue to undermine trans people withoult fear of being called biggot.
A lot of people do this and it gets on my nervs.
They use reasonably sounding anecdotes that are actually coming from a very hateful and prejudice place. Its just transphobia tho
Have you tried contact the school district im sure that much public schools have a policy.  I am a teacher in Dallas and our policy is the student uses the rest room they identify with.  Its possible the principal can't deny you access
Use the restroom that best matches your identity.

You want to force a confrontation. Dates times what was said, document everything.

Let it happen several times.

Then sue, the school, the district, and name the specific staff.
What people are suggesting is called civil disobedience which was popularized by Henry David Thoreau and used by people like Susan B. Anthony, Gandhi, and MLK.  Basically, if a law (or rule in this case) is unjust you are under no obligation to follow it.  It works better with allies, but it is known to be effective.
Probably don‚Äôt do this but‚Ä¶ if my kid was in your situation I would get them an STP and tell them I backed them for using it in the bathroom the school was requiring them to use it. A few times of being reported for standing to pee would most likely make the administration uncomfortable and allow use of the boy‚Äôs room. I‚Äôm petty with no fucks left to give, and a 37 yo, trans man so my outlook on life may be a bit different.
Ooooh! Cool
What? I don‚Äôt understand what this means in this context

I told her but she completely blew me off üòî
HELL YESSSSSS
Wait wha-
My friends are all supportive, and I have an idea of what to do.
How do I do this? Just curious‚Ä¶
Excellent response.  I hadn‚Äôt seen your response but I posted the same link.
I have not started transitioning.
I‚Äôm in a public school and I tried telling them that they are breaking the law. She wouldn‚Äôt hear any of it.
Oh fuck you
I second this. NYCLU has a legal intake line also (https://www.nyclu.org/en/about/legal-assistance) and might be able to help you out. When I was working at the national office (which was in the same building), we worked on a lot of articles for the website calling out shitty behavior by public schools against their students.
You were using the mens room before, just keep doing it. I‚Äôm saying don‚Äôt ask permission to use the mens room ask for forgiveness if you get caught.
I have a hard time believing that this isn't an excuse. The father wouldn't know unless explicitly and repeatedly informed that he uses the men's.
My dad isn‚Äôt supportive, and I plan to tell him never to talk to me again during thanksgiving. I understand everyone‚Äôs situation is different though. 

Parents don‚Äôt get to dictate how their children live their life just because they‚Äôre related.
But how would you get into trouble? There‚Äôs nothing perverted or sexual going on and you‚Äôre just using the restroom. What‚Äôs the underlying issue if there is one?
You're welcome :) also, It's Bella, lol (idk how I misspelled it üôÉ)

Stay safe friend ‚ù§Ô∏è
Don‚Äôt make your fellow students miserable because your principal is being spineless. It‚Äôs not their fault. Maybe talk to a few of your female friends and see if they would be comfortable frequenting the mens restroom? That would probably have more of an impact, and not make people uncomfortable with flirty attention.
Hmm. Do you have at least one accepting parent? They could sign the forms for you.
Well then, just sayin this is a court case waiting to happen
Oh... That could be a court case.
Steal a wall
Be cautious when breaking the law. Because yes, destroying or vandalizing school property is illegal and most American schools are fitted with cameras. A boy a few years ago in my middle school got caught shitting on the floor because they looked at the hallway camera footage and he was the only in there at the time of the crime.
My first thoughts are to flush things that should not be flushed. The non-dissolvable baby wipes come to mind. You will know that they should not be flushed if they do not tear when left water: the opposite of toilet paper.

You could also flush melted butter, or any other room oil that turns solid at room temperature,  or things like rice (it will take a lot.)
I would just use male bathroom. If she escalates it it will come back and bite her in the ass big time.
Ohhhh, i did that before, but a staff member made me use the girls üò≠
I see the point. Other men did not ask if they are allowed either.
The issue is if they live with their dad and just go to the men‚Äôs, that getting reported can put them in danger.
They don‚Äôt want complaints from parents, as my parent is really unsupportive üòî
I was kidding when I said I might. But I could use your tactic! Right now I‚Äôll just report her ass
I wonder if it would work to have friends who are girls complain that they're uncomfortable with a guy being forced to use their bathroom
But he could ask the girls to tell their dads it makes them uncomfortable to have a boy in the bathroom
No, just my dad :(
One fucking brick at a time
Or sanitary products like tampons or pads...
I‚Äôd still use the mens bathroom, they can‚Äôt always force or make you do anything. If it gets any more heated, I‚Äôd film the interaction too, especially if they were trying to pry me out of the bathroom stall. The mess is on their face in the end.
Just keep using the mens room
Well it's not like your parent is the one answering to the complaints the school gets anyways. So this is a silly argument from them. 

Just use the toilet.
What right do your parents have to know what bathroom you use? If they try to tell your parents, bring up how that can be construed as gender discrimination because they would not do that for a cis student.
But if you just use the RR how would your parents find out? Are they watching you go in?
Oh! Ok! I‚Äôm so sorry. I definitely misread the tone. Thank you for the response.
I WILL DO THIS
I'm sorry dear, I don't think there's much you can do. As soon as you turn 16 you should be able to, though.
Ummm that‚Äôs‚Ä¶not possible. I‚Äôve tried, TRUST ME
This, if they try shit just film and play it cool, let them lose their shit while you just ask to be left alone so you can go to the bathroom. The authority teachers have over you is more illusory than you think. If I was a teacher going in and pulling the kid out would worry me about getting fired. If your teacher/principle won't see it that way, the world will when it's public.
I will
Imma just use the boys bathroom as I have done.

"""Is it transphobic to not want trans people in 'women/men only' spaces?"""	"Like what the actual fuck do you think ""transphobic"" means?! YES. Yes it is transphobic. Yes it does mean invalidating the identity of trans people. Yes it does mean that you want to treat trans people as second class citizens, unable to use facilities provided to every other member of our species.

Why are you excluding trans people from those spaces? A trans woman is a woman, the trans man is a man.

So unless you are suggesting that they're going to do something, I don't see why you would go out of your way to exclude them from those spaces.

So indulge me, what are trans people going to do in those spaces that you're so afraid that they're going to do? And those things are things that apparently cis person would never do in those spaces? 

How about this we just ban all bigots who have narrow point of views from fucking politics. 

After all those spaces are meant for people who aren't dumbasses.

Cis person: ""Is it transphobic to be transphobic?""

100 other cis people: ""No, of course not!""
It fucking sucks. Trans people just want to live their lives
I feel like no matter how hard I try to avoid dehumanizing takes on Trans people, I can't seem to avoid it. It's so tiring to even wanna argue it anymore, I just wish cis people would get a fucking life and stick their nose somewhere that actually mattered. 

And I laughed at all the responses in the threads advocating for gender neutral bathrooms. Like all this could be avoided if a bunch of bigots were just ignored and shunned from the rest of society. Instead we have to do this weird roundabout solution just to avoid the ire of a bunch of cousin fuckers.
I saw the question on the original sub reddit and thought the same thing. Plus the comments were like ""No you're not because trans people are delusional"" I almost got into a argument with half the comment section but stopped myself. I was so mad and I hope the page gets deleted.
Sounds to me like cis people want to define what is and is not transphobic. Rather than the trans people, who you'd expect to know best lol
I keeping seeing ‚Äòdiscussions‚Äô like this EVERYWHERE and I‚Äôm so done with it all. My existence, OUR existence, should not be for debate. We are real people who just want to live our lives peacefully. Someone‚Äôs religion should not get to decide whether we live or not. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous (understatement of the century). 

Trans women are women. Trans men are men. This isn‚Äôt a new thing for fuck‚Äôs sake. Trans people have existed for AGES.
I saw it but scrolled past quickly because I was in no type of headspace to be reading the comments on that post.

I‚Äôm afraid to ask but‚Ä¶.was the general attitude in the comments positive or negative towards trans people?
IT IS TERF RHEOTORIC!  terf's are so annoying
""Is it racist to not want colored people to drink from our water fountains ?""

People see ""phobia"" and think it's like being afraid of spiders smh my head
I love how the OP of that thread just posted it and left, never replying to any comments. It's almost like it wasn't a legitimate question but a way to get people to argue with each other. I'm so tired.
It's fucking segregation and it's disgusting
Cis people just let trans people live our goddamn lives in peace and quiet and not turn our entire existence and fight for basic civil and human rights into a fucking debate topic Challenge (LEVEL: IMPOSSIBLE)
Yes, people don‚Äôt realize that the definition of transphobia is the disbelief that trans people are actually the gender they say they are and not wanting to treat them like any other member of their gender.
I saw this on my front page too, and luckily most of the top comments seemed to agree with us here. Still a stupid question, but I‚Äôm glad OP (who was married to an incredibly transphobic dude iirc) decided to ask at all instead of blindly accepting her (?) husband‚Äôs (?) opinion
Or to rephrase their question, ""is putting trans people into a position where they're likely to get the shit kicked out of them for the comfort of bigots transphobic?""

Seriously, it's a fucking safety issue. People are either too stupid to realize that, or their goal is to make other people unsafe for cruelty's sake.
Yep. Transphobic.
definitely transphobic
Trans ppl are just not allowed in public according to those people lmao
Short answer: yes.

Long answer: yeeeeeees.
WE ARE PEOPLE NOT POLITICS
If you‚Äôre referring to the r/nostupidquestions post I would 1) remind you of the sub name and 2) suggest you actually read the post. It was a good faith question. People should be able to ask good faith questions and it‚Äôs a damn good thing that person asked the question that I suspect has annoyed you so much because they were asking it after listening to transphobic rhetoric from people they know. They wanted to avoid being transphobic.
I think the only case where it‚Äôs okay to exclude trans people is in a case where someone has severe PTSD or trauma and have people who look/sound masculine or feminine as a trigger for it. Other than that, excluding trans people from single gender spaces is absolute BS
It's also just pro rape. Sa against cis women doesn't change with trans bathroom protections, but it sure as fuck goes up for trans people without those protections.
I saw this too and was going to chime in before it got locked. So frustrating. I shouldn‚Äôt have to wave my ‚Äúproof of genetically grown vagina‚Äù card before I take a dump at a restaurant, I just want to be a normal woman doing normal things. 

I feel like most people that are worried about this have probably taken a shit next to trans people many times without even knowing. The only reason they‚Äôre scared is because someone tells them they should be. Personally I‚Äôm going to keep using the bathroom like any other normal person, without making eye contact or saying anything, and I bet nobody will ever notice.
Wow. That‚Äôs crazy and infuriating
Ppl are absolutely stupid sometimes
Yes PLS, lets Just have the genital inspector in the bathrooms, or Just create a third bathroom, for creating much more feel of akwardness beetween female and male trans people, OR Just do 4 bathrooms, why not eh? Transphobia Is Just a freaking mess and they don't want to realize that.
I feel this so hard.  I didn't know how bad the problem was until my partner started transitioning and had to determine while were out of the house - wtaf she was supposed to go to the restroom?  And due to anxiety not going wasn't an option!

Feck people who are afraid for no reason.  I'm all for unisex bathrooms if it solves the damn problem.  Or you know - individual stalls that you can't see into. 
And who the heck thought peepable stalls were a good idea in the first place?! That's what I want to know! I just love making eye contact with a human I don't know when I'm sitting on the porcelain throne.
r/okaybuddysneedhon
Ik I see so many cishet AND queer people being like ""I'm not transphobic but...... \*something transphobic*""
omfg i saw that same post on my home page

i cannot tell you how much these garbage takes infuriate me... what, out of everything they pick on, they decide ""OH, you know whats a big problem in society??? trans people using public bathrooms that are meant for their gender."" literally stfu
If you don't allow trans people in their preferred spaces, you are telling them they aren't what they are. You are invalidating them. Segregating them is just another form of harm.
I think I read somewhere that the ""women's"" restroom came because when women started getting rights and were alowed to work, the men felt uncomfortable going to the same toilet as them as if they were equal or somthing. So really I dont know if the restrooms should still be gendered in the first place.
I wish we could make everyone feel comfortable without getting angry at eachother. Maybe further educating the public on trans matters might really help everyone.
Segregation 2.0.
Makes me think of a girl who makes girl only parties but allows trans men to come in.

I get that our experience in life is different from some cis men but it still hurts in my opinion.
Not really biology is still in place and trans women will stay trans women and biological women will stay biological women. It‚Äôs just how it is but why not love ourselves for being trans instead of trying to compare ourselves to biological women and their feelings.
It's always been a basic way of segregating second class citizens. Black women weren't allowed in female restrooms because they were ""more violent and dangerous to the poor weak white women"" and in the UK, when the church reformed, catholic women weren't allowed in the female restrooms because they might ""corrupt the poor, easily influenced protestant women""

In both cases, and now with trans women, two things hold true:

1) Socially acceptable women are weak and can't defend themselves physically or mentally

2) Not socially acceptable women are not only stronger, but also aggressive and violent. 

Funny how bigots tend to repeat history without even realizing it.
I FULLY AGREE WITH THIS POINT. It's happened so many times to deny trans people exist.
There would be no GOP then lol (which I‚Äôm fine with)
I don't even *really* get why gendered bathrooms are still a thing anyway.

Like...all people do is go in, privately do their business, wash their hands (hopefully), maybe touch up makeup a bit in the mirror, and leave.
Idk man me pissing in the stall instead of the urinal has got to be fucking *terrifying* for the cis dudes in the bathroom, I'm sure of it.
The only argument that I‚Äôve heard that seems valid is that if sexually assaulted, (especially in a state that now bans abortion), a woman could get stuck with a rape pregnancy. 

Personally, I believe that the number of trans women out there who would rape is extremely small, but it is still a danger, and still happens. To ignore the issue and demonize people who bring it up is only going to hurt us -and more importantly, victims of said abuse- in the long run
you‚Äôre voicing my exact thoughts. it‚Äôs kind of surreal sometimes
I call it JAQing off
Literally did that and the person said that's fine too. Is it bad or good that they're going full mask off? üòÆ‚Äçüí®
which... is what they said about black people back then. That black men are dangerous subhumans who will rape white women. Same playbook.
could not be more accurate
Well actually as a nb with restroom panic I like gender neutral bathrooms.
Mainly positive. And heck i think they were quoting there mother bc they weren‚Äôt sure bc her mom was never called on her bull.  Not great but a lot better than i thought.

Edit: although maybe i looked at a different post. The one I saw was 2X chromosomes
I am allowed to be frustrated by general transphobia. Did I attack the person who asked the question? No, I expressed my frustration at the lack of general understanding for such a simple concept. I am allowed to be frustrated, and I am allowed to vent. I don't need someone telling me it's not okay to be upset by being potentially thought of as subhuman.
No, we don't punish innocent people for someone's trauma.
Yeah that's pretty invalidating
‚ÄúWhite feminism‚Äù which reinforces the patriarchy versus true, intersectional feminism.
Lmao I love your username
Hell I don't even do that, public bathrooms are the bane of my existence.

I don't even know how people can comfortably poop, with strangers all around them.
""BREAKING NEWS: Trans men and closeted trans women terrorize men's bathrooms with urinal boycott! THE END OF SOCIETY???""
Do you know how much More likely it would be for that person to pretend to be a janitor, or just run in when no one's looking?

It's not like there's an invisible barrier on the door that can prevent anyone from walking in.

It's just a lame excuse to exclude and attack trans people.

And then you get your next problem once they succeed there they're going to start banning gay people from being able to enter the bathroom, for the same exact reason.

Let's face it we're going back to the same excuses that they used for segregation. And they're too ignorant and blind to freaking see what's happening.
I think this will be different for everyone. I don‚Äôt even feel just one way about it myself. 

I was talking with an (ex)friend about Lia Thomas and he kept misgendering her. I told him ‚Äúlook, we can continue talking about trans athletes but you WILL gender Lia correctly or you ARE a bigot and we are done.‚Äù He responded ‚Äúoh, if I want to talk to you about schizophrenia, does that mean I also have to put on a tinfoil hat?‚Äù

On the one hand, I appreciate him taking off the mask because i immediately understood that I shouldn‚Äôt waste any more of my life on him. On the other, I can‚Äôt actually avoid him because he and I are in some of the same social circles. And there have been plenty of times when just worrying that he would be at an event was enough to ruin my mood for that event. 

So, my conclusive answer is: ‚Äúit‚Äôs complicated‚Äù 

This part is more of a vent than actually relevant but I still can‚Äôt get that response out of my head. In the conversation, I had already told him that intentionally misgendering a person he knew was trans was no different than using a racist or queer-phobic slur. So for him to then respond to my ultimatum by not only affirming his commitment to his bigotry but by introducing a fourth way for him to be shitty that I hadn‚Äôt even considered‚Ä¶it just blew my mind. Like, you‚Äôre not only sticking to the transphobia but you‚Äôre also going to, unprompted, tell me that you‚Äôre an asshole about mental health as well.
At least you know to avoid them now üóø
I'm down for gender neutral bathrooms in addition to what we already have.
I think the same person might have posted on multiple subs. I saw it on NoStupidQuestions, but it was basically the same poat you're describing. 

Response on NoStupidQuestions was overwhelmingly positive too, tbf. The top comments all seemed to be some variation of ""yes of course it's transphobix sorry your mum sucks"" and ""I don't understand why public bathrooms are gendered anyway, just make full floor-to-ceiling stalls and have em all be gender neutral""
Yes, even your very first sentence sounds like an attack. ‚ÄúWhat the actual fuck do you think ‚Äútransphobic‚Äù means?‚Äù Well they don‚Äôt know, hence why they asked the question. ‚ÄúI saw this on my front page. People suck‚Äù definitely doesn‚Äôt sound like you‚Äôre saying ‚ÄúI have no problem with people asking questions like this‚Äù to me
Of course not, but that doesn‚Äôt negate that person‚Äôs right to a safe space
Mine?  Ty, it‚Äôs not very clever but is accurate lol
>just make full floor-to-ceiling stalls and have em all be gender neutral""

Amen
Thats a relief
I posted it here, not on the actual post. I'm fucking *venting* for fucks sake. I'm not talking to that person at all. Give it a rest.
Why should that safe space disregard people who are also allowed to be there?

If a cis woman passes as a man should she be pushed out of a safe space because of someone else's trauma? 
Accommodations should be made but never at the expense of someone else's safety. 

Every woman has a right to a safe space and no one has the right to push them out over something like that.
Exactly. I wouldn‚Äôt want to trigger anyone‚Äôs trauma, because that makes me feel horrible. Especially because solitary confinement is horrible and would only cause more trauma. I don‚Äôt like that this is even something we have to grapple with, but it is.
I just think it's funny, maybe because I suddenly realized that I was a girl all along in 2022"	11pzjid	trans	846	0.98	2023-03-13 04:03:24
My 5 year old says they‚Äôre a girl	"For context, I am a cis woman myself and may accidentally get some things wrong. Please feel free to correct me, and just know that I am still learning. 

My child is five years old, AMAB. They are also on the spectrum, and sometimes have difficulty with pronouns (typically using he/she for the incorrect gender, but will switch them if corrected).

Because of that, my partner thinks they may not understand gender and believes I‚Äôm overthinking this for their current age. 

But hear me out - my child has referred to themselves as a girl for as long as they could talk. If you call them a boy, they will correct you and say ‚ÄúNo, I‚Äôm a girl.‚Äù They love video games and will choose a girl avatar every time. A few day ago, they told me they have started using the girl‚Äôs bathroom at school (which my partner and I are both supportive of) and have asked their friends to call them a girl. They said it makes them feel sad when some of their classmates say ‚Äúno, you‚Äôre a boy.‚Äù

To me, this all sounds like something that has been consistent for the entirety of their life so far. But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it‚Äôs ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this, and that I should just ignore it for now. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a phase, but have just been trying to respect my child‚Äôs wishes for pronouns, bathrooms, etc. and don‚Äôt want to put any pressure on them either way. 

I guess the reason I‚Äôm posting this is because I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age, or if any of these things were relatable to you when you were a child. Also, are there any questions I should be asking them? Trying to help this child have as little trauma as possible lol

Edit: First off, I am overwhelmed with gratitude to everyone who decided to comment and share their experiences. One thing I remembered that wasn‚Äôt in my original post is how if you ask my child what they want to be when they grow up, their answer is always ‚Äúa girl.‚Äù I do believe they are probably trans, but am going to encourage them to be themselves regardless of gender identity. Love the suggestions for a child therapist, am going to pursue that route as well. Luckily, we live in a very liberal/lgbtq-affirming city and I know that whatever decisions they make about their body will be met with love and support."	"Yes, I knew at a super young age. Not everyone does, but many do.

My personal recommendation is to find them a child therapist to help them work through things and figure out what they want & ensure they understand. You can figure out next actions based on that.
Yes, I had it in a young age but not that strong and my parents are transphobic. Now I am 20 years old and suffer from not being a girl (No Hormones yet etc.)
Autistic trans masc here:

1 out of 6 autistic people are trans. We're more common then most people think. Best thing to do is to just call her a girl. If she stays like this, congratulations, you have a trans daughter. If she doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with gender expression and pronouns. It would've changed a lot in my life if my parents had done this.
I have very spotty memory of my earlier childhood but i do remember wanting to be thumbelina and being sad when i was told i couldn't cause she was a girl.  I also remember wanting to skip and being told boys don't do that. Also being really interested in braiding hair. If i was given the freedom to choose then i would've figured it out, but since i was told i couldn't by people i had no reason not to trust i just accepted that.


Children can know their gender at a very young age. If they can understand the concept there is no reason to believe they couldn't know how it applies to themselves. 


I think you're doing the right thing. There is no harm that comes from respecting her wishes now, and if she feels the same way when she begins puberty then she can take measures to avoid the wrong puberty and avoid an enormous load of trauma and a lifetime of pain that comes with that.  I wish my parents had let me have that freedom.
Children as young as two can understand gender, so don't listen to the people saying your child is too young to know! Just listen to your child, support your child in their choice to use whatever pronouns and name and clothes are affirming, and if they are trans they will feel affirmed and figure out it's right for them. You should also find them a child therapist who is experienced in dealing with trans kids in an affirming way.
I just want to say I think it‚Äôs amazing that you‚Äôve come online to try and find people with experience and ask questions, that‚Äôs an amazing step so many people would never take and I think it shows how much you love your child. 

I think you know your kid better than anyone, if this has been something so consistent, from such a young age, I would trust your instinct and keep listening to what they‚Äôre telling you. 

Because I‚Äôm 110% sure, they will thank you so so much for it when they‚Äôre older! I definitely don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a ridiculous idea that someone who‚Äôs five can have a grasp of those concepts, I think in many ways they‚Äôre innate, I just hope it goes well for you all and I want you to know you‚Äôre a great mum!
studies show that children have a concept of their gender identity as young as the age of 3. I‚Äôve also heard (haven‚Äôt researched thought) that people on the spectrum often experience gender differently then neurotypical people. You are doing everything right respecting your child‚Äôs identity.
At the age of 10, with my first mobile phone, I worked up the courage to call up a sex ed helpline to ask about getting a sex change (terminology of 10yo me). I didn't have the courage to actually finish my question without hanging up but...yeah.
>But I have people in my circle (who are cis themselves) who think it‚Äôs ridiculous that a five year old would have any concept of gender identity and will potentially grow out of this

For all we know, she might! But is there any harm in humoring it, if it makes her happy? 

A lot of times people act like transitioning is this huge, completely-life-derailing decision that can never ever be undone, but in truth I don't think you have too much to worry about. Your kid won't be taking any medication or anything until she hits puberty at the earliest, and even if she starts taking hormones, she can always go off them if she decides otherwise. So as for now it's really just a matter of how she wants to present herself to the world in dress and presentation and things like that :)

That said if she's been insisting on this for as long as you can remember, it does sound like a lot of trans kids i've heard of that knew at a young age. But, either way, I just want to reassure you that letting your kid experiment is probably not doing irreparable damage.
I didn't think ""I'm a girl"" at a young age, but I did wish I was a girl a lot. But I think it's such a personal experience, that it may be difficult to judge how your child will develop based on how other people did.
I first knew around that time. And then was closeted for years since my family wasn't quite as cool as you seem.

You're amazing parents btw!
So the whole ‚Äòthey‚Äôre too young to know‚Äô thing is only ever applied to children who declare as anything other than entirely cis. It‚Äôs an invalid argument from the get-go, because if children really were ‚Äòtoo young to know‚Äô then we would not be treating them as girls or boys based on their body parts to begin with. 

Also, even if your kid was ‚Äòtoo young‚Äô and they determined later that they actually did want to go by agab pronouns, then ‚Ä¶ so? Even if this lasted a week, so? (I don‚Äôt think it will in this case ftr). Kids exploring gender and figuring out where they fit and who they are is normal. And gender identity evolves as well. Gender can change and our understanding of our gender can (and should) evolve. 

Basically, your kid is sad when someone calls her a boy and happy when someone calls her a girl. So people should call her a girl. If that ever changes, even to the extent of her wanting to be fully identified as a boy, then just do this again and ask people and institutions to use the pronouns they prefer at the time. It‚Äôs totally fine to do that more than once. 

Anyway, you are right and your husband is wrong. Also, I‚Äôd ask him what‚Äôs going on underneath his ‚Äòtoo young‚Äô argument. It might be that his resistance is less about having a trans child and more about fear of what might happen to his openly trans child in a world  that often doesn‚Äôt like trans people, and that‚Äôs getting in the way of him understanding the reality of the harm that also comes from kids  being forced to pretend to be someone they aren‚Äôt because who they are ‚Äòisn‚Äôt ok‚Äô.

I‚Äôm nonbinary by the way, and have always been aware on some level that I was both boy and girl, although for a lot of my life I did not know that this was a valid and possible identity, only that o wasn‚Äôt comfortable being only a girl, but I wasn‚Äôt only a boy either. If that makes sense.
At about 4 years old, when I understood that I wasn't going to wake up some morning as a girl. I felt like there was a mistake somewhere. So if I'm not an aberration then yes some of us do have that sense. I was forced into dropping that feeling or else. Thank you for being a concerned parent.
Sociologists generally accept that it‚Äôs between the ages of 4 and 6 that we begin to identify and become connected to our social expressions of gender, so no: I don‚Äôt think 5 is too young to understand the concept. That being said, I‚Äôm not an expert - just a transfemme with a few sociology and anthropology courses under my belt.

As a person who‚Äôs on the spectrum and wishes people took me seriously when I was a kid, I‚Äôll just recommend you take their desires to heart and let them express themselves how they see fit. Other people might think it‚Äôs not okay, but if you know what makes your kid happy and what makes them miserable, then do what makes them happy.
25 years ahead of me
  
As painful as it might be for them and you, believe me it's better they don't spend the next 25 years as a boy if they aren't.  I did a lot of cool shit in my 20s as a boy NGL but still. 
  
They'll either grow out of it on their own like my tomboy cister did when she reached puberty, or they won't.
If they've been like that they're whole life then it's likely they know they're a girl. Maybe try finding a therapist and then figure out the next actions. I wish I knew from a young age, I'm 19 and now have all the emotional baggage that came along with living falsely. You've got this and its amazing your trying your best as a parent!
The cool thing about being trans at a young age is there's a lot of time before puberty really has a chance to do its thing. As others have said, going to a gender therapist regularly may help sort things out, and allow your child some time to explore who they are, and give you a moment to understand the world you may get more exposed to :)

I want to take a moment to express appreciation for your word choice, especially considering how new you say you are to this. You said ""my child says"" instead of ""my child thinks,"" and used AMAB rather tastefully as well, I think (acknowledged that that was the assignment at birth, which may or may not be correct). Kudos, in my opinion!
Well, I also had suspicions from 5 years old, I remember ask to my mom ‚Äúhow does it feel to be a girl‚Äù while she was making se dinner. Anyway I guess you should seek for a child therapist.
As extra sometimes people forget this rule: ‚Äúif they were able to know that they were boy/girls at 5 years old so do your *son*‚Äù
This makes me so happy to read üëèüèΩüëèüèΩüëèüèΩ you‚Äôre so awesome for reaching out. I knew from a very young age, much before I knew what transgender or transitioning meant. I just knew that I didn‚Äôt feel comfortable with the body I had.
If your child is being taught gender roles (which society pushes at that age) then they understand enough to know if it fits them or not. My earliest memories in life are of being confused about why people were pushing me into the gender roles that felt wrong to me. A therapist is definitely a great idea.
Support them unconditionally. Worst case scenario, they grow out of it. Best case, they feel accepted and never have to experience  transphobia from their parents.
I wish I knew when I was that young, before I had any sense of embarrassment or fear or what people would think. Sadly I started to realise much later and at that point I was so nervous to disappoint my parents or worry them in any way I just couldn't do it
At 3 I was forced a ""nice little boy haircut"" by my grandma.  I hated it.  I didn't know why I couldn't have long hair like my mom.  At 4, I was screamed at by my dad for having my nails painted.  I was confused why I couldn't paint my nails, but mom could.  I always HATED being called ""handsome"".  I wanted to be pretty.

I never thought ""I'm a girl"" as a kid, because I didn't understand the difference.  I thought everyone had a penis.  I had no idea I would for certain go through male puberty.  I thought it was random how you developed.  At 9, I said I wished it was possible to change sex.  I thought every boy wished they were girls.

I wasn't great at understanding things, or advocating for myself, or really explaining myself, but I knew on some level I was a girl my whole life.  Once male puberty happened, I died inside.  I couldn't function.  Couldn't date, couldn't hold work, couldn't make lasting friends.  I was miserable until I came out at 33.  When I went for an HRT letter, I was diagnosed with autism.  So much stuff finally made sense.

If I knew as a kid what I know now, I would've been adamant.  But I was born in 86.  Nobody talked about trans kids, or knew what autism was.  I went through life suffering, with no answers and no help.

I wish you luck.  Support them no matter what.
Hey OP, this may ease the doubts your husband may have about it potentially just bwing the autism:
https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/amp

There's a correlation between being on the spectrum and being non-cisgender. In other words, an autistic person is more likely to be trans than a non-autistic person, and vice versa. It's therefor important to be extra observant in these cases and to not discount one for the other
As someone who is on the autism spectrum, a lot of autistic people don't understand the concept of gender which is why a lot of trans and non-binary people are also autistic. We tend to play around with gender more and figure out we're not cis more than neurotypical people.    
     
If your child says they're a girl believe them.
Being autistic makes them more likely to be trans, it's statistically significant comorbidity. I say this as an autistic trans woman.
In kindergarten (around age 4-5) I would always gravitate forwards the boys and things deemed ‚Äúfor the boys‚Äù. For example, when asked to divide into lines based on gender, I would always go to the back of the boy‚Äôs line before being redirected to the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù one. I would claim ‚Äúthe boys are more like me‚Äù or ‚ÄúI‚Äôm more like a boy inside‚Äù when this happened. Luckily, I had great teachers who generally let us do whatever we wanted, so I was usually able to experience kinder in a non-conforming way, which I loved. My tendency to prefer to be grouped with boys and even perceived as one continued all throughout my childhood. When my egg finally cracked, I realised that some part of me had known the truth all along. I recommend finding a trans-friendly therapist for your child and preferably one who can also offer family sessions to you and your husband as well. Also, encourage your child to be their true self. As others have said, the worst that could happen is you let your child be happy and fulfilled during a phase of experimentation. Nobody loses here. You‚Äôre doing great.
Get them a child therapist. Kids that age do go through a lot of phases, however assuming this is one will be catastrophic if you're wrong. Take them to a professional who can help them sort out their feelings and decide if they want to go on puberty blockers when they turn ten.

Also, just talk about it with them every step of the way and make sure rhey know they're loved and they're valid no matter what choice they make.
Personally I knew something was ""wrong"" about me, and that I wanted and would be happier as a girl since I was like... 6. So yes it's entirely possible to know at a super young age. I'm 19 now and only accepted the fact I'm trans now, so trust me, starting early can certainly be extremely helpful for someone's happiness and mental health. I'd say that finding a psychologist who specialises in working with children would be a good idea. Either way, even if they grow out of it, being supportive is certainly great and I'm glad you're doing your best to help them discover themselves.
As soon as I knew what gender was, I wanted to be like my sister. I knew that ""boy"" didn't fit. It wasn't until puberty permanently changed my body that I really grasped that my assigned gender was wrong.

I because of how my parents/family reacted to my experimentations with gender, I've only fully accepted myself this very year. I need expensive laser hair treatments, difficult voice feminization therapy, invasive and painful surgeries, and extensive hormone therapy to get me where I want to be.

I don't regret much in life, but I do regret not advocating for myself and getting the treatments earlier. I'm currently grappling with existential dysphoria, and I'm lamenting my lost childhood/teenage years.

I'm not saying dive in headfirst with transitioning, but honor what your kid is telling you. Encourage her, support her, and maybe talk to a doctor or gender specialist about first steps you could take.
I can't really answer your specific questions, but I just wanted to let you know that it is very common for autistic people to be queer in some way. I'm a trans autistic person and I understand the concept of gender, but have decided that it doesn't apply to me. 

Just because your child messes up pronouns verbally doesn't mean they don't understand it internally. Autistic people are often misjudged based on our speech or external behavior and imo your husband shouldn't discount your daughter's understanding purely because of her speech.

I agree with people saying to let her be herself. If she changes her mind later, there is no problem with that, no harm done.
I wonder if your friends would say the same thing about gender to the cis kids. ‚ÄúUgh my AMAB son Michael thinks he‚Äôs a boy. Ridiculous because how can they have any concept of gender?!‚Äù Only the trans kids are not capable of conceiving of gender ü§£

This might be a phase or might not, but what are the real consequences of not-ignoring this? In a year they tell you they‚Äôre a boy? üòÅ seems like there is no consequence at all and that your kid is happy and that I‚Äôm jealous she gets you as a parent ‚ô•Ô∏è
There is a higher percentage of people who are on the Autism Spectrum who are LGBTQ
Just let them be them and be there to support ur son / daughter no matter
what. It does sound like  they maybe either transgender or non-binary.

https://sparkforautism.org/discover_article/autism-lgbtq-identity/

Now I am on the autism spectrum  and I am Transgender now I am transitioning later
In life but I wish I had of been able to transition at ur son / daughters age.
There wasn't the support back then I am in my late 40s.

My family doesn't support me being Transgender and don't understand 
Being Transgender.

Just be there and always support your son or daughter
Been saying this their whole life? Your husband is in denial. You need to sort this out with your husband before your kid hits puberty to make sure they can get puberty blockers/anything else they will need.
I can't say I ""knew"" at a young age, just that I kept gravitating to feminine things. I'm also autistic and ADHD, and I grew up in the 80s and 90s in a very conservative community, so I was forced to try and present as neurotypical and masculine. 

As for the people who keep trying to tell you it's a ""phase"", the answer is that allowing your child to present how they want is the fastest way for them to go through it. If it's not a phase, then allowing them to present as their true self will allow them to grow up much happier.
Hello, I am autistic myself.

While it would be possible for a child, especially an autistic child, to misuse pronouns. It does not appear to be the case here, because they are /also/ asking to be allowed to fulfill female roles. Misuse would also be random, not consistent.

It's clear that the child views themself as female.

Transgender identity is very common among autistic individuals, so it is not surprising. Some people attribute it to the different way we view ourselves and society. In any case, these feelings are completely real and valid for the child and should be treated as such.

It sounds like you're doing everything you can to help your child, and that you and your child are both happy. :) Good job!
Likely autistic, and definitely trans person here. I knew from my earliest memories, which was somewhere around 4 years old. I didn‚Äôt know I was ‚Äútransgender‚Äù. I knew I wanted desperately to be a girl, and that it wasn‚Äôt okay for me to want that because of my parents. Your child is so lucky to be allowed to be themselves.
I wished I was born a girl since I was 4 and it‚Äôs never changed or wavered in intensity. People who say kids don‚Äôt have a concept of gender are dead wrong.
Everyone else has given valid input so I'll just pop in for a quick comment about:

""Other cis people say i should ignore it and that a 5yo can't possibly understand gender""

But does that matter in this situation though? Using feminine pronouns and doing other traditionally fem things makes your child happy. At the base level, it's really just that simple.

If they do understand gender, good, they already figured out something that can sometimes take an entire lifetime to work through. If they don't understand gender, oh well, worst case scenario this makes them happy for now and they'll be able to figure themselves out in the future, whether they are a girl or not, with no repercussions.

If it doesn't harm anyone, why not make the child happy?
i didn‚Äôt think ‚Äúi‚Äôm a girl‚Äù at that young of an age, but i did think ‚Äúim not a boy‚Äù so I kinda understand. so my parents thinks me being trans is teen questioning and i couldn‚Äôt wish more for someone like you as a parent. It‚Äôs difficult and i don‚Äôt know how to help you understand this and what to do but just always be utmost accepting of your kid (not saying you aren‚Äôt just don‚Äôt forget k?) and allow them/her to come to you for anything and be open to change. Again this is just what i would want as a trans child so i hope my rambling is useful in some way sorry i‚Äôm out of control and kinda lost and i just needed to fantasize about what kind of parents i wish I had every night when i‚Äôm in bed
Hello. To set things first, no one here is a psychologist unless absolutely proven, so we really recommend getting in touch with a pediatrics psychologist with experience and training in early gender dysphoria. The (hopefully good) psychologist will be thorough in helping your child understand their feelings and identity, they will also help confirm your child's identity, not medically, but just making sure that your child IS trans. It's different in children than adults, but valid nonetheless. If and when the time comes, your child will go on puberty blockers to prevent any male puberty from taking place, and when decided by medical professionals, they will go on HRT.

To help your child at home, buy them some girl clothes and other girl stuff you'd think they'd like. Also, talk with your partner, let them know that it is not their decision to choose your childrens gender, and anyone else who pulls that ""they're too young"" crap. Best wishes.
Your child is lucky to know who she is from such a young age. I am 20 and unhappy largely because when I was younger I didn't understand what being trans was and I didn't know who I was.
> I was wondering if anyone here knew they were assigned the wrong gender at a young age  
  
Always. I have *always* known that I am trans. I'm also autistic, by the way. It took me some 26 years to actually transition because whenever I mentioned my female gender, I would receive a ""no you're not"" in response and it made me a miserable child and a miserable adult.  
With that said, don't push anything on your child, but leave the option always open and ensure you inform them of their options as they grow up. The goal is to help them find themselves before they experience puberty, using puberty blockers if they desire to give them more time to decide. Despite sensationalism from the media, puberty blockers are essentially harmless and merely *delay* puberty if the child later decides to commit to their AGAB.  
  
Bless you for coming here for advice, and I wish you and your child all the best! You're doing great so far.
Even if it IS a phase (high it very well could not be) why wouldn‚Äôt you invest in it if you can? You won‚Äôt ever know if it‚Äôs ‚Äújust a phase‚Äù until you‚Äôve missed the beautiful opportunity to be invested in something that will truly shape their life. For some reason it is ok for parents to go with their children on all their other ‚Äúphases‚Äù but not this possible one. Jump in, do the things, buy the clothes, experiment with makeup. Your child will tell you if it‚Äôs not them, and you‚Äôll know really quickly if it is.
Thank goodness you live in an lgbt friendly area. I saw the part about a child therapist before reading that part and got scared, thinking a therapist would only try to tell your child to stop. I'm glad to see you so supportive!
I knew before 5. I wish I had a supportive environment. It is really important to listen to them now, it would be better to accept and address this now and throughout childhood than to finally coming up with enough guys to do something about it when 40.
It is messed up to say that someone experience is not valid it doesn't matter the age
I knew it extremely early also and I know a trans man who was exactly like your child. He is still mad that he couldn't start earlier and had to wait till he was 17 to get hormones. I'm extremely mad that I got mine with 21 years, because you know...our life could have been so incredibly much better with far less dysphoria....I actually can't write more right now or else I will spend the rest of the day crying..

I'm so happy to hear that you are supportive, please keep being supportive and for me it sounds like your child is trans. I wish you all the best for the future
Lots of kids know at five. Don't listen to people who don't know what they are talking about.

There is a higher than average rate of autism amongst transgender people. something like 20% in trans people as opposed to 1-3% in general.

Good thing is that you have time to find out, children grow in a very similar way until they hit puberty. You can always get them some girly stuff and some boyish stuff and see whhat they gravitate towards.

School clothes might be a problem if they want to live as their affirmed gender at school so I would suggest gender therapy to get this all figured out sooner rather than later.
I was three and told people I was born a boy but became. A girl, I am afab. Anyways I'm trans queer gender. So... Idk. I think you should allow your child to explore their gender and figure out what they feel is best. They'll know what fits them best.
I second the child therapist route. Maybe it is a phase. Maybe it's not. It certainly doesn't hurt to have someone help your child explore their feelings. I may have turned out completly different had I: A. Been brave enough to even tell my parents about my feelings when I was that age. B. Had someone to help guide me through how I felt about girl vs boy, male or female, or some variety between. Took me 30+ years to break down the conditioning and social pressure that placed me soul searching before cracking my egg.
Even if they does end up ""growing out of it"" that is no reason to not let them identify this way now. People act like gender is such a permanent and important thing. I see no point in it.

Edit: Also I knew there was something different about me before I even knew what gender identity was, but because the fact that ""I was male"" was constantly shoved down my throat, I didn't really realize that I might be trans until very recently in my life.
Yes I knew, was too afraid to tell anyone.
I wish to god I knew I was trans that early in my life. I was to busy dealing with another big life issue during my childhood which was coming to grips with my disability. I‚Äôm visually impaired. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs crazy, impossible or wrong to discover that for yourself that early in fact I commend her she sounds like she‚Äôs really in tune with her gender identity. If I had known that early things would probably be massively better for me right now and I‚Äôd be much better off than I am right now. I‚Äôm still young relative to most people but still. You should encourage and empower your child they may be on the spectrum but she really sounds like she knows what she‚Äôs talking about. Please feel free to dm me.
I always knew but I never corrected anyone, your daughter has guts, buy her a dress or something
I‚Äôve been saying I wanted to be a boy sine I was 4. I was made to repress that and now I‚Äôm 19 and a trans guy. I‚Äôm glad you are so supportive of your child. That is going to make a big difference for them growing up.
I definitely knew from the time I was YOUNG. Everyone around me knew and noticed, too. No one supported it, so I hid it for years. But I had been standing to pee from the time I was young, like the boys. I dressed like them, talked like them, did ‚Äúboyish‚Äù activities. It was obvious. You can know young.
There‚Äôs a trans woman TikToker Veondre who definitely knew as young as like 6 or 8 and went on blockers when puberty started and is now 17. I think you can definitely know as young as that, and right now you won‚Äôt have to think about blockers or other things until she‚Äôs a little older. When you do get to that place please listen to her, I know as a trans person younger trans people who went on blockers and got socialized as the gender they identify as are a lot happier. I have a few friends that transitioned early and it makes all the difference.
I think a therapist might be a good idea if you find a good one, but first and foremost I think it's AWESOME that you are so supportive. I'd say let your child be who she is, and if it's a phase, then it's a phase, but the most important thing is to make sure she knows that regardless of what the world says, it's ok to be her (or him, they or whatever she chooses) and that she have your support. All children should have their parents love and support. Noone should have to be afraid to be true to themselves with their parents. You're amazing. All the loves to you and yours <3
At that age, my son, that is on the spectrum too, will say that they was agender, and will inform me in the morning if they was a girl or a boy or neither that day. As a teenager, he said he feels now that he is a guy, but a very androginous one - he enjoys things that society consider feminine, he wear clothing that he consider pretty without any concern about it been masculine or feminine clothing, etc.

Giving him space to experiment in such young age made him comfortable on his own skin, and generally speaking a person that has a sense of self worth and that faced bullying and assholery from peers with a strength that is admirable. 

So, no matter if will be a phase or not. Give them space to experiment, and things will go well.
I knew at age 4, but didn‚Äôt start hormones until I was 33. Your child definitely knows the only thing you can do is give them love and support and when they‚Äôre old to go onto blockers so they don‚Äôt go through puberty then eventually start hormone treatment. I honestly wish I did when I was younger the mental dysphoria gets so much worse as you get older it doesn‚Äôt really hit until puberty kicks in it‚Äôs just felt wrong.
I knew I was trans when I was 5 or younger. I never verbalised it so clearly because my father and brother are always very critical when I was young which made me play everything close to the chest (whether related to gender or not), not even telling my mom anything I deemed personal despite her being unwaveringly supportive. Then when I got older I realised what telling anyone would mean (child of the 90s when ""that's gay"" was synonymous with ""that's bad""). I definitely knew though. I used to cry at bath time, and ask my mom when my parts would look right. I knew there was something wrong with my body before I ever knew that girls had something else between their legs. I asked when I'd grow boobs and was constantly disappointed to learn I wouldn't. I used to dream every night about waking up in the right body and having everyone just be happy for me. When I got slightly older, maybe 6-7, I used to feel the spot where a vagina should be and look desperately for signs that something was forming there. This despite not knowing what should have been there yet.

I never outwardly expressed it for fear of ridicule, but I definitely knew. If someone had supported me it would have made likely had a happy childhood and well adjusted adulthood vs 30 years of pain, ducking cameras and mirrors, every photo that was taken of me looking like I wanted to commit multiple homicide, not caring about my appearance, throwing myself into dangerous situations hoping someone would end my existence.

You're doing right by your child. By your daughter. Don't let someone who's had no experience with something convince you they're an expert.
I would just do your best to support them. Pronouns, name, clothing, hair, etc is all stuff that if they find out they aren't trans later down the line can be reversed. Even puberty blockers are temporary, but I don't think you have to worry about those right now.
From a transgender woman When i was a child I honestly didn‚Äôt play with either especially when you take your vcr apart at 2-4 years old id always prefer to dissect stuff an try an put it bac together lol if i did play with children‚Äôs toys it would be both my barbie prefers a 4x4 off-road lol are i would paint my monster trucs blue are pink are a light girlish colors‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶I always knew i was different from the beginning‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶it was no phase i tell you‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.when i hit 6 I discovered the word transgender from my moms babysitter she was good to share secrets with ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.i regret not transitioning there because thanks to male puberty i look stupid lol an lets be honest male puberty is no where near cute
People are aaaaaaall over this already it seems, so I just want to say you're doing a great job. :) Listening to them and letting them decide for themselves is absolutely the right way to go, ignoring it and forcing them to pretend to be a boy is conversion therapy and causes a lot of damage for a trans person.
I was four when I went around the house pretending my dad‚Äôs baggy shirts were dresses, talking/acting as ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù as my young brain could process, even saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm a girl‚Äù to my parents. This never did go away, though I became more and more scared to express it as time went on. If my parents noticed the way you have, maybe I would be less messed up in the head. This doesn‚Äôt mean that the kid is trans, but it‚Äôs definitely a possibility
I felt out of place by 10, but there were hints before that.
You should check out r/CisParentTransKid. There‚Äôs lots of good advice from lots of parents as well as trans people at various different points along similar roads to yours. I second the advice for a child therapist. Just make sure that your child is comfortable talking to you about things and that they know they can always go to you with anything they every want to discuss even if they don‚Äôt feel they have to words yet or don‚Äôt think you‚Äôll understand. Show that you‚Äôre always willing to try. And make sure that they know that if they don‚Äôt like their therapist or don‚Äôt feel comfortable for any reason, they don‚Äôt need to stay with that therapist for the rest of their life. Sometimes therapists don‚Äôt work out because they‚Äôre bad, but sometimes personalities just don‚Äôt work well together or a therapists techniques that are usually incredibly successful don‚Äôt work with how your child learns and thinks. It happens and it‚Äôs okay to seek out someone else when that happens.
Strongly trans
Your sense of gender is inherent to your sense of self. The claim that a five year old wouldn‚Äôt know or that someone is too young is wrong. I knew really early but wasn‚Äôt given the space to experiment, and it hurt me later on. Let her be herself and if she is trans, great, if she isn‚Äôt, great. But, most people have an idea of their gender as early as they know who they are in relation to other people. This could be just fun and play, but these experiences are very similar to me and I had the feeling of wanting to be a girl really early on. It is great that she has the confidence and the words to express who she is, wether that be trans or not.
At first I thought 5 is a very early age to know your gender, but then I remembered my past self,and wow. Even from a young age I acted like and liked  girl stuff, the only reason why I realised I am trans much later in life, was because I had no concept of trans people untill a few years back. It is definetely possible that your kid is trans, and you should find a kid therapist that works with lgbtq youth to see what you can do from here
Btw many kids would wish they had a mother like you, keep it up!
I knew at a young age but my family convinced me it was the devil through some very aggressive means... I had always loved singing, and princesses, and wanted to try on my mom's dresses and shoes, but they made me repress all of that. I wasn't able to start feeling normal until my 20s, and it meant having a depressing high school life where I felt disgusted by how I was treated. In PE I would always wait to change, seeing guys changing felt so dirty, and even more importantly, seeing me change was out of the question, they were these big hairy things pushing eachother into lockers, and breaking things, and I was just so overwhelmed by all of that. Regardless of the trauma, it meant I missed a lot. I never went to a dance or event, or met with people outside a small friend group. You seem far more supportive and willing to accept their choices, but the point being, let them make them, let them explore, help them to discover who they want to be, then you can both say that neither of you missed out on the beautiful experience you both have to share. They are going to need you, and the love of a child who feels seen and heard can be a magnificent thing.
Even if it were to just be a phase, where‚Äôs the harm in referring to them as a girl for now? If they, a few years down the line, come to the conclusion that they aren‚Äôt a girl afterall there won‚Äôt be much harm done. Imo, and I‚Äôm not a parent so I might be totally wrong on this, it would make no sense not to support your child in how they identify. It seems like there would be way more damage done if you don‚Äôt support them, no matter how you look at it.
I've been going through something similar with my 6 year old. I've put in the time and effort to research extensively and have found that most paediatricians recommend allowing your child to express themselves. They are still learning the concept of gender and they might grow out of it, they might not. But allowed them to explore who they are now is much better for their health both now and in the future. If you want someone to talk to about this, feel free to message me. I can also drop some links to sources if you're interested in the articles but I'm on mobile rn so I'll have to do it when I'm on my pc.
Children tend to understand the concept of gender at a young age. They‚Äôre exposed to it very young (blue is for boys, pink is for girls. Trucks are for boys, dolls are for girls) so they do understand gender, and if she‚Äôs saying that she‚Äôs a girl, I would believe her. Even if she changes her mind some day, then that‚Äôs okay. I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs any harm in letting children socially transition, if you think that it will improve their life. Also, this can prevent them from going through years on internalized transphobia, and taking years to feel comfortable in their skin. Plus, they can go on puberty blockers in their teens, and start estrogen/testosterone, and have a fairly normal puberty, instead of having to go through extra steps. (This is all optional though, and depends on your state) I would mainly just focus on letting her socially transition, and see if she continues to feel this way throughout her entire childhood.
i knew since i was 5 because that‚Äôs when i started having gender being enforced on me at school which gave me a clear understanding of gender and where i fit in pretty young and i transitioned socially at age 7 and have been very happy living as a trans masculine person at the age of 18 now :) transitioning young helped me find myself as a person instead of having to constantly stress over being called and treated like someone i‚Äôm not. i cut my hair and moved schools and dressed like a boy and was mostly accepted as one and defended by my peers. i strongly urge you to watch videos on trans people and consider starting them on hormone blockers before puberty, id say 11 and then on female hormones by 14 would give them a smooth transition without having to experience the pain of physical and often irreversible in trans girls dysphoria caused by male puberty and postponing it until they‚Äôre sure won‚Äôt hurt them if monitored by a doctor :) i would‚Äôve been so much happier if i had been on hormone blockers and wouldn‚Äôt need top surgery now, and their face will go masculinization they‚Äôd be very unhappy with if you don‚Äôt step in and really talk it through with them in maybe a couple years when they‚Äôve explored a bit more?
I mean I subconsciously knew since I was 7 but was forced to repress it until I finally decided to confront these feelings a year or two ago
You're in the right here, and thank you for listening to your child.

The idea that kids can be ""too young"" to understand their own gender is just a collective guess from cis people who frankly have probably never intentionally interacted with a trans person ever.

The science does not back that idea at all, and shows we can be certain of our present and future trans identity at least at six, often at four, some even earlier. Even before speech, kids are sometimes observed distressed about their body's sexual characteristics, who then later transition.

As long as you keep listening, you will do okay. It's better for their health and wellbeing to have supporting parents than anxious gatekeepers.
People who claim that kids don't know what they want are people who don't respect kids. Kids aren't dumb, they know what they want and they know what they like. If she's saying she's a girl then that's what she is. And you know what? If she changes her mind, that's ok too. If that happens could be she's actually non binary. Respect what she feels and don't tell her how she feels is wrong.
I‚Äôm so glad you‚Äôre so supportive! You‚Äôre awesome.
I am a trans woman. 

I knew at 3 but was not met with support. I spent my entire childhood looking at the girls at school wishing I could be like them. 

Told my parents at 14 that I was a girl and wanted to transition and they put me in therapy with a conversion therapist who claimed to be trans friendly. I backed out of the decision after that and it took me another 10 painful years to finally accept myself. I absolutely agree with the advice to find a therapist, just make sure to vet them. 

I can assure you your child knows their feelings on this and they are genuine. Not saying they can't change with time and develop but they are likely not going away and not a phase. 

You are an amazing parent and I am so proud of you for supporting your child. The world needs parents like you üíú
Honestly you seem like a very caring and supportive mother I wish my mother was like that. I'd recommend sending them to a child therapist or a gender therapist who specializes in trans children.
this post may have been settled but I want to say my piece. Please note I'm a bit forgetful and I may get information wrong and mean no harm, please correct me if I seem wrong or kind of rude.

I personally think the child is correct in her beliefs. Around her age I also believed I was meant to be a girl, as I would flick my hair a lot like you'd see in media, and sometimes lick my lips a lot to pretend it was lipstick. My hair was always shoulder length, and quite thick, so I just naturally felt feminine, despite that everyone still seen me as a boy. The thing is, I never expressed to anyone how I felt feminine, at least nothing obvious, and nor did I verbally express it. I too always have played as a woman when I could make a character in games, as part of my identity, but I am always acceptive playing as a man in a game if there isn't a choice, gender has never ""concrete strong"" on my beliefs. 

At the age of 11, I was diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder) like your daughter seems to have been, except for the age I was diagnosed at, but I believe I am high functioning, I don't know if your daughter is too, but if she is she may truly grasp an understanding just as good as anyone else in LGBTQ when she is older. If your SO believes autism hinders her understanding, he should try to find more information and contact professionals, if he didn't already, about this situation, you should get involved too.

My feelings towards being a girl got weaker as I grew older, but they never fully gone away. I genuinely have always felt like I'd become a woman within a heartbeat if I ever got the chance. The reason my feelings got weaker is simply because I tried to become more acceptive of being an AMAB over time. I'm glad I gave into more of a feminine identity though. 

Although I wholeheartedly think you should encourage your child, just make sure she's healthy and safe in her transition!
I remember on the first day of pre-school having to wear a frilly shirt (I'm AFAB) and crying and saying that I hated how I looked. My mother had always let me wear boy clothes before I had to go to school and it was awful when I was forced to wear feminine things. If your child is showing even more blatant signs, I wouldn't be surprised if they really were trans.
Right now, it doesn't matter if it's a phase or not.

Right now, your child says they're a girl, they want to be a girl, so they are a girl.

Things might or might not change as they grow up, maybe it stays the same and they live their life as a girl, maybe they find a more specific label under the NB umbrella, as I said, it doesn't matter

You do what makes your child happy right now, five years old isn't too young for cis kids to know they're cis, so it shouldn't be too early for trans kids to know their gender either. Your kid has all the time in the world to figure themselves out and explore, but right now, I'd say they're pretty sure they're your daughter :D
Id say to let ur kiddo express themself however they like, just remind them that they‚Äôre not tied down to a single gender and can always end up being something else (not always the case but it‚Äôs good for them to know)
Keep I mind even if it is just a phase your child still deserves to be respected! If they change their mind later on, so be it! Just let them know you'll always support them!! <3
Five is not too young to be that aware in my opinion. My egg cracked only recently, at around 28, but thinking back I realise that even as a child I wished that I was a boy with a tremendous intensity. I rejected femininity for a long time, then I went through a phase of hyperfemininity around 26 and now I'm back to my old goblinous ways. 

Five is not too young to identify oneself. If anything, I'd say that your girl is very mature about herself.
i just want to remind you that if they decide they're not trans at this age, then there are absolutely no consequences. you can take them for a haircut the same day, you can get them new clothes, you can switch to using he/him and a masculine name and it will all be over. 

exploring their gender by letting them be whatever they want to be will only teach them that their parents listen to them and support them. you're making the right choice by giving them the support to be themself, whoever they may turn out to be.
When I told my mother I was trans, she recounted a story from when I was three years old and called it her ""first clue"". For additional context, I am AMAB and have ADHD, a similar variance in executive function to some types of autism.

While not everyone does, some us for sure know we are our gender at litterally as young of an age as we are capable of expressing ourselves. Others not so much, others didn't realize they were trans until they were much older, and capable of fully unpacking the idea consciously, 

&#x200B;

For sure just support who they are. Some kids do have sudden shifts in their gender identification between like, 5 and 10. If they say they are a girl, call them a girl. But don't PUSH them to be a girl. They are still figuring out their gender at such a young age, and their relationship to it might suddenly change as they approach puberty. 

Also yeah, a therapist is a good idea. Being (possibly?) trans is confusing, it needs talking out.
If 5 year olds don't understand gender, then why do they know words like boy, girl, man, woman, mommy, daddy?
I absolutely knew by four, and only wish I had supportive parents like you. It was 20 years later that I was able to start transitioning.
I would recommend you to support them and just see how it goes.
Your child is more than meets the eye.
apparently gender dysphoria and stuff like that is common with people on the spectrum
I definitely knew how I felt around 3 or 4 (preschool age).  I also understood that it wasn‚Äôt acceptable where I grew up.  It seems great to me that you‚Äôre a parent who is willing to listen and better yet that your kid trusts you enough to share all of themselves.  I never had that growing up and it definitely hurt me a lot, especially by my teen years.

(32yo trans woman)
when i was 5 i remember i wanted to wear skirts and such. even dreamed and daydreamed about it. your kid probably known who they are by now. good news is that you dont need to medically intervene until like idk 12 or so years old minimum? so for now all you gotta do is but her correct clothes and use right name/pronouns etc
I knew since I was 2 trust me listening to your kid now can save them a lot of anguish down the road
Therapist is the right way to go

But I also want to add that to your friends who are saying this is ridiculous and they can't know their gender identity at 5

Unfortunately, we do not have the luxury of not assigning one to children. Gender is in everything
You can't raise them without impacting their gender identity. As far as I am concerned it is far better as a parent to validate them in something they might change their mind about later than it is to dismiss this now. 

If you teach them that you will value their perception of their gender identity now they are gonna have no issue telling you of that changes. If you unwittingly teach them that you don't by dismissing it and telling them to wait until they are older then they might feel like they can't tall to you about it even when they are older. 

So you're doing the right thing
I knew when I was very young. I am not sure quite how long I knew but I am certain that I knew by the age of 6, because at 6 I met another trans kid who also knew they were trans, and managed to fall in love even at such a young age. We are also both autistic. I am sure I must have known when I was a bit younger than that as well. We ended up getting married last year.

As for what you should do with your kid. 

I think every kid should be taught about trans people, because trans people are people who exist and deserve understanding. If that happened, then trans kids would as a side effect of this, learn what the name and context is for what they‚Äôre feeling, and thus have the ability to ask for help. They would also learn that their parents are positive and supportive of trans people, and thus that it‚Äôs safe to ask.

A lot of children end up feeling like it‚Äôs not safe to talk to their parents about being trans, even if their parents have not expressed any hostility towards trans people. I don‚Äôt know for sure as it would be hard to study but I think it might have to do with the fact that they view the parents as the primary source of the incorrect and hurtful gender role being forced on them, and therefore see the parents as unsafe to ask for help from. I‚Äôm not saying this is necessarily the case, but it‚Äôs something to be aware of because it‚Äôs pretty common. So talking positively about trans people can really help with that.

If you create the right environment your child can develop their sense of gender without pressure in any direction, and feel safe to come to you and ask for help if needed.
Ok well at that age, absolutely no medical stuff will happen. So just do the things that make them happy now and if that changes, it changes. But it will make it easier for them to discover themselves if people do what makes them comfortable now.
I came out at the age of four for the first time and my parents just rolled with it. They asked everyone in family and kindergarden to use my preferred pronouns and it went good. I even got into school as a boy (I'm a transman) officially. But due to bullying in school I got in the closet again and my parents thought the whole thing was just a phase and that it would be alright. Due to trauma i even convinced myself over time that it was just a phase. I'm currently working on pulling myself out of the closet and my misery again. 
I would recommend a therapist, so your child can talk about their experiences and get the help they need and in the case that they get bullied or something, they have someone to help them through that so they won't  feel the need to give up their reality.
The fact that your 5 year old has a concept of gender should clearly show to your sceptic cis persons that gender has nothing to do with a concept that first has to be learned.
Everybody has a gender, regardless if they are educated about that or not.

I'm happy that you are so supportive to your girl. Great Mum! ‚ù§Ô∏è
I knew i was male from my earliest memories (around age 5)
I new pretty young that I wanted to try girl things and always wondered/thought it would be cool/better to be a girl. That was all suppressed by religious beliefs from fam and school. I'm 22 now and just starting to transition and looking back can't help but feel without those influences my life woukd be alot better now and I could've been better educated and transitioned YEARS ago. 

It is honestly just so great that you are supportive of your child and open to things and willing to help. As for stuff to do like many said a gender therapist woukd be great. Also just directly asking your kid about how they feel, ask if they know difference between boys and girls and what they liked to be called etc
I'm pretty sure the only reason i didn't know at age 6 was because of my transphobic dad constantly forcing toxic masculinity onto me. I loved wearing pink skirts, and I always wanted to have long hair.

I figured it out at 13 instead, when I made a tumblr account and found out that trans ppl existed and was like ""so you mean I *can* be a girl?""
Yes you are doing everything right by respecting their pronouns and wanting to use the bathroom. Obviously children that age won‚Äôt know what being trans is so a lot of the time it‚Äôs confusing and we aren‚Äôt sure why we feel the way we do but I can say that from around 5 I would be happy anytime I was included in with the boys/told I looked like my dad and that I used to try to pee standing up (I‚Äôm a trans man ftm for context) so yes it‚Äôs completely normal and valid for your child to know how she‚Äôs feeling and if anything she‚Äôs being really brave for correcting people when she feels uncomfortable because that takes a lot of courage even when you‚Äôre well into your 20‚Äôs.
Some children know they're not their agab as soon as they can make the slightest difference between boys and girls, and I think your child's lucky to have you as their mother. You might want to reach for a LGBTQ-friendly therapist. 
In the meantime, keep affirming your child's identity, if they say they're a girl, they might probably be one. Especially if they refer to themselves as a girl for as long as they can talk.
I'm not a parent myself, but I see absolutely nothing wrong about social transitioning at the young age. Even if she ""grows out of it"", literally nothing has been done and she can just continue living as male.

The ""talk"" about it ig I would do somewhere around the start of puberty, since if she's trans, she's gonna want puberty blockers and later HRT because holy hell puberty is already super hard, but us trans kids had to go through a wrong one. I'm glad your child knows about trans people and feels free enough to express herself, I didn't even know about the concept, and simple knowledge would've saved me hours of agony spent on the floor wondering what's wrong with me until I found out about I could be trans.

Just love your child, let them express herself however she wants, it's absolutely harmless at this young age
Yes, I knew. I wasn‚Äôt adamant about sharing it, though I wish I had been. Society wasn‚Äôt as accepting in the 80‚Äôs. Instead I buried it where it festered and almost killed me.

Mad love to you fir being such a powerful advocate for your child!
I knew I was a girl from as far as I can remember, just never thought it was possible, realistic, or even had terminology for it until a few years back now.
I knew something wasn't right at a young age but didn't know how to explain it. Now I'm almost 22 trying to figure things out lmao. Its a struggle but I'm sure your kid will do great with your help
I‚Äôm FTM for context. I didn‚Äôt know until I was 15. But I often played as a boy in video games when I was very young. I would say once I came out the best support for me was my father just accepting it and asking if there was nothing I needed. I went to a children‚Äôs hospital where they have a gender identity program. And they are lovely and helped with everything so much. I suggest them because they can lead you to good a gender therapist as well as if you ever want to take the next steps.
Gender is more fluid than people often acknowledge, and while it is entirely possible that your child will ‚Äúgrow out of it‚Äù you should support them as they are, and if they ‚Äúgrow out of it‚Äù it has to be on their terms. Gender is already established by that age and from what you are describing I‚Äôm pretty sure they would get the clinical diagnosis of gender dysphoria.
A child therapist is a great idea. Thanks!
I second this. 5 is such a young age and a crazy time for development. 5 year olds are only starting to have a basic understanding of complex emotions and feelings. They go through phases constantly. (I have a 7y/o so I speak from experience). That's not to say your kid isn't valid in how they identify but having a professional who can help them through these feelings is really your best bet. And for the love of god, talk to your kid every step of the way, be supportive and make sure they know that no matter who they are, they are loved (which it sounds like you're already doing so good job there!)
Do you have a source for the claim that 1 in 6 autistic folks are trans? I know a lot of us are trans, but I've never seen anyone claim the rate was that high
This is the best advice. I was thinking the same.
Any research into this and you pretty much just find that cis people don't question or desire to be the other gender, which falls into the DSM-5 designation for gender dysphoria as well. Here is more about that https://www.psychiatry.org/patients-families/gender-dysphoria/what-is-gender-dysphoria
Make absolutely certain that they're a trans friendly therapist. This is more important than I think some would realize.
Just be careful to check for a therapist that works with lgbtq people, that is open minded.
> doesn't stay like this, congratulations, you have a cis son. Kids should have a safe place to experiment with

I see it all over the place, but I haven't seen any sources. 

Actually... there was a big meta study result people were linking to, on [https://www.spectrumnews.org/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/) I think but I can't find it in 5 secs of searching.
I too would be interested. That seems very high.
A seminar at the Radboud hospital/university about Autism Spectrum Disorder that I went to 2 years ago.
I believe it‚Äôs because autistic people are generally more internal so are thinking about stuff a lot more, like being trans.
Yes, absolutely...
It says 6 times higher. Not one in six, but that's still /huge/.

[https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/](https://www.spectrumnews.org/news/largest-study-to-date-confirms-overlap-between-autism-and-gender-diversity/)

I will caution anyone reading, that the empathy score measures ""neurotypical expression of empathy"". Empathy is autistic people may be similar or higher than neurotypicals depending on the individual.

Using the bathroom in public is possibly the scariest thing to do if you don't pass üò≠		"yeah, you‚Äôre lucky that you pass so well, it‚Äôd be really scary otherwise
I agree. I'm right in that middle ground. I don't want to go into girls bathrooms because I don't want make girls uncomfortable in such a vulnerable space. I don't want to go into boys bathrooms because I have boobs and I look like an old lesbian, meaning I don't feel safe.

Right now, it's easily the most troublesome part of transitioning I'm dealing with.
kinda weird of you to take a picture of Zooey Deschanel in the bathroom like that
Omg that was me. I had to use the bathroom on my first day socially transitioned and I was scared to even go into the ladies room so I searched for one that sounded like no one was in there and no one would see me. Thankfully I found the gender neutral bathroom on campus but hopefully one day that fear about going into the ladies room either goes away or fades
You pass to me. Wouldn‚Äôt look twice
It really is so nerve-wracking and it'd be worse if I was a trans woman. I'm a trans guy and at this point mostly pass  but for the first 3 months on T it was extremely stressful though thankfully it's getting better
The last time I went to a public toilet I was nervous even though I wasn't presenting or anything. They're just shit in my area, I'd much rather spend ten minutes going to one in a supermarket than the town ones
You pass tho
Totally understand,  work told me to use the men's restroom. A lot of the guys I work with do the stare and start to walk out until they realize they're in the right restroom and I'm in the wrong one. I've also had a guy stop me from leaving one time. I had to run to the stall and lock myself in. He hammered on the door and said, ""I'm not going to hurt you..."" I was thinking 'yeah that makes me feel super safe'. Luckily another coworker stepped in at that moment and I was able to rush out as the guy scoffed at my fear.
Still scary even when you pass cause Ik everyone at my school knows I‚Äôm trans so looks while entering the bathroom is a regular thing for me
Took me years to get the courage to use the ladies loo. Still find them a little frightening even now.
that‚Äôs true, good thing you pass though!
I'm at the fun point where I get stares in the mens room, but don't feel confident/safe in the womens.
Not scary for me.  Although I do pass.  Anyone that gives me shit isn't leaving conscious.  We need to flip the script and make transphobes the ones who are afraid.
Mood, sweetheart.

Be brave, and be yourself everyday ‚ô°

You're beautiful.
Hun, you pass. And it‚Äôs scary for us all, whether we ‚Äúpass‚Äù or not.
Girl don't take pictures in the bathroom... It's rude and depending on where you are, illegal.

But seriously, please don't

Edit: all these downvotes and not a single person actually justifying this. I'm so confused. It's a bathroom y'all. It's not a place to take pictures.
It is, and it is really unfortunate.
Idk if this is gonna be helpful to anyone else, but I (MTF) always keep a mask on me for whenever I use the bathroom, it covers the bottom half of my face which is the main thing that stops me from passing. I've had to go a couple of times without it, and it's actually been fine. But it significantly reduces my anxiety about it.
Yeah it‚Äôs scary even kind of passing
Lol how would your beautiful self know that.
Stay strong, be confident and go about your business.
You look AMAZING! üòç‚ù§Ô∏èüåπ
Aww, you are too kind.
Same, but I'm on Spiro so I need to use the washroom every like thirty minutes.

*insert pain emoji*
nah cause i hate doing restroom checks at work cause of this üò≠ every half hour it‚Äôs weird looks in both restrooms and dysphoria cause i should be in one without being judged and not be in the other at all
That's a first, but thank you üòä
This! Cis-women come in all shapes and sizes and i wouldnt bat an eye at this person.
Too kind üò≠
Yeah. I started using the men's room before I started T and continue to do so even though I don't pass. I don't know if I would be brave enough to do that if I were a trans woman. The men's room and women's room are totally different atmospheres. 

For what it's worth, OP, I think you look lovely and pass pretty well.
I made sure nobody was in the bathroom. But I don't see it as a problem if you are the only person in the bathroom.
Ive seen pics of cis women that take photos in the bathroom tho. Not as often as cos men but they definitely do take pics in the bathroom
Women take pictures in the bathroom ALL THE TIME :) :) :)
It's the truth.
Me too.
Thank you ‚ò∫Ô∏è I'm just mainly concerned if someone talks to me. Since I haven't done any voice training
I uh... Thank... You?

"Tonight I explained to my 11 year old sister the term ""Transgender"" and asked her a few questions, showed her some beauties on here, and finally told her that I was trans. She didn't have a single problem in understanding or in acceptance. Transphobes, you move."	"She was a gem. We spoke about what she understood about the term ""Transgender"". I showed her some really cute trans babes and asked her to tell me if she thought they were pretty, which she universally did, and then I asked her if she thought that although they were born as boys, if she thought they were now girls. She had no problem. ""it doesn't matter how they were born, they are girls to me"".

Then I told her that I was like those girls, I was trans. She said initially ""ahh, I really like you as my brother, but boys suck so okay"". Which, is acceptance to me. We spoke about bathrooms and if she would feel comfortable if any of the girls I showed her were in the same public bathroom and she said ""of course, they have to pee"".

Finally, I showed her a photo of me in makeup and she was like ""she's pretty"". I then revealed that was me and she was really suprised and told me I was sooo pretty. I couldn't be more proud of my little princess. I wish someone had this conversation with me at her age. I think it's an absolutely vital conversation to have with little children, when you deem them ready to understand.

Love you sooo much, my lil princess warrior üíñ"	"I'm not crying, you're crying
Humans aren't made to hate, they're raised to, the earlier kids learn about different types of people, the better they are at understanding and excepting, she's lucky to have a sister like you!
Imagining an 11 year old saying, ‚Äúshe‚Äôs pretty‚Äù and getting shocked Pikachu face when she finds out it‚Äôs her older sister is melting my flippin heart ‚ù§Ô∏è
[deleted]
When we talked to our 11 year old. Her biggest concern was that mama was happy. And could she go shopping. Kids are great.
Absolutely beautiful to hear this love. Thank you so much for sharing. It brought a tear to my eye, and a smile to my face. All the best for you and your sister!
You‚Äôre lucky to have such an amazing family! My heart swelled with joy reading your story. Thanks so much for sharing!
My little sister is mad accepting of me being trans. She doesn‚Äôt fully get it but she‚Äôs interested by it. If someone says something bad about trans people she‚Äôll call them out on it and tell them the right way of saying it. I got a dog a while back and called her Bailey, my sister said Bailey is a boys name, I said it‚Äôs a unisex name, she wanted to call her ‚Äúprincess‚Äù but I (a pre-T trans man) am not going to start shouting princess down the street, her response: 
‚ÄúWe‚Äôve already got one unisex person in the house we don‚Äôt need another one!‚Äù 
She‚Äôs 11 now and honestly I cried of laughter.
I had the same kind of talk with my 10 year old brother. I didn‚Äôt tell him I‚Äôm a trans guy yet, just that I‚Äôm gay but he took it so well. Plus he told me he wanted to try nail polish. Kids are really too good for this world.
This is the wholesome content we need <3
When I came out to my now brother, he was super accepting. Turns out, he's also trans so now my mum has a full family of boys ahahha
No no. I'm just chopping onions. Nothing to see here.
Oh my gosh that is wonderful... I swear I'm not crying...
Gives me so much hope about talking to my kiddos. My wife is like, ‚Äútell them when you are ready‚Äù and I‚Äôve just been waiting. They aren‚Äôt stupid. They see me come home from work and change into my ‚Äòcomfortable clothes‚Äô which are usually leggings, bra, and top. One asked why I was wearing panties, and I said ‚Äúbecause I like them best‚Äù. I should tell them and record their responses. üòÇ ‚ù§Ô∏è
Beautiful
this is so wholesome i‚Äì ü•∫üíï
I told my 6 year old brother what transgender meant and he said ‚ÄúI think I‚Äôm transgender because part of mom and part of dad made me‚Äù and me and my mom were just sitting there like ‚Äúhow did we mess up so bad but also not?‚Äù
>""of course, they have to pee"".

Awww. from the mouths of babes....
I mean, I'm trans but you can tell an 11 year old just about anything and they'll roll with it.
I'm so glad it went well! Also this made me cry. Which I'm OK with.
My daughter was 7 when I came out and she had 0 issue with it at all. She understood what was happening and had completely and totally accepted me. She has misgendered me less than I‚Äôve misgendered myself. And when anyone does misgender me, she is the first one to jump to my defense. 

We have grown so much closer. She is a girly girl, and I trend that way too. My wife on the other hand is a Tom boy. So my daughter and I get to bond over all the girly things my wife isn‚Äôt into.  I‚Äôm so proud of how accepting she has been. And she is so proud of me too. She isn‚Äôt ashamed at all. She will just randomly tell her friends I‚Äôm trans unprompted and has all the girls in her day care asking my wife about me (wifey works at the day care).
This is so endearing, kids are the best allies sometimes. It reminds me of another post a while back where a mom explained to her daughter about gay couples. The kid‚Äôs first reaction was, ‚ÄúNo, it‚Äôs weird!‚Äù 

Five minutes of further explanation later, the kid was already planning out her entire wedding with her future bride.
So wholesome
so cute.
Did you see a therapist or just figured out that you're trans?
Understanding always helps. We hate and attack things we don't understand but the more we learn the more accept.
Kids are wildly accepting
See this is what everyone should be like! I have three daughters, two cis and one trans. We all except and treat each other with love and understanding so why can't everyone else!  

Beautiful story sweetheart!
I wanted to cry a little, stupid tear ducts not working.
Agreed. Phobias are either created in genetics or in training. Genetic phobias are related to life-threatening issues such as things which cause pain or distress. One of those phobias is fear of the unknown. In this context, other phobias are taught by not teaching at all. Humans are afraid of and hate the things they don't understand or cannot naturally recognize and will perceive those things as threats, even if it's entirely irrational. 

But we are a new generation. We have the chance to teach future generations how to accept, not hate. We are pioneers to this idea and practice.
Preach.
It was even cuter than you could ever imagine. There was this momentary look of just like ""Damn, that's my sister. I like this. This is cool"" and then it was gone.
I knowwwww!!! I lost it at that üò≠
Someone in another post put it really well. For the parents, it's a social standing sorta thing. And, having a trans kid reflects negatively on that social standing. It's just a shame where their priorities fall.
Kids are little bundles of innocent, wrapped neatly in a small package of cute...well, most of them.
You're welcome. It was too wholesome not to share. This little girl is my world, and her acceptance, although fully expected all along, gives me more strength than she could ever know.
You're more than welcome.
Having a dog called ""Princess"", just makes you even more manly, didn't you know.
I don't personally use nail polish, but I can see the allure for a small child.

All they require is a little explanation and they understand.
Good question
For the last 9ish years, I developed a lot of self-hate. About 4-5 years ago, I started getting this radical idea that I wished I was born a girl. I had no idea what the concept of trans was at the time, and that thought of wanting to be a girl was, to me, a very dirty secret that I planned to take to my grave. A year after I met my girlfriend, so early 2019, I told my girlfriend my ""dirty"" little secret and she just laughed and told me that many people thought this way. This immediate and absolute acceptance lead me on a journey of exploring both this idea and what was causing this internal pain I had had for all of my teenage years and into early adulthood. Which in turn, lead me to the concept of transgender and my eventual realisation that I was in fact trans. The pain I was feeling was gender dysphoria. I then inevitably went back through my memories and started linking pieces together and I became certain that I was trans. I have spoken to a GP about my gender after this and they referred me specialist gender clinic but, as any of my UK redditors will tell you, there is a 2 year waiting list. I am about one year out for my appointment with a therapist.

Hope that answers your question x
Absolutely.
Kids are just wild.
I totally agree. Thank you for your comment.
Wait what's this liquid pouring out of my eyes? Am I okay? Wait.... I've heard of this before it's called.... A cry? Crying that's it! Oh god.... I'm crying! Wait how do I stop it? Do I just plug my eyes? I gosh now I have an urge to hug someone! ü§ó‚ù§Ô∏è

Tbh, fuck public bathrooms	"Why the hell are they gendered? Whenever i go in the mens room i feel like i dont belong there but i feel unsafe in the womens room. I guess transphobes just dont want us to use any bathrooms.

I would never pass up the opportunity to use a family/GN public restroom because fuck gendered ones"	"Gendered bathrooms are a scam created by the bathroom companies to sell more bathrooms
My school has a gender neutral bathroom but everyone uses no one uses the gendered bathrooms mostly because they suck and are creepy cause it's an old building but the gender neutral bathroom is rlly nice
>I guess transphobes just dont want us to use any bathrooms.

Hit the nail on the head. The goal is to make public life so oppressive that queer and trans people will be forced back into the closet.
Agreed. I do my best to use disabled ones which I know isn't great for those with disabilities but at the end of the day I need to prioritise my safety.
I'm not comfortable going into the guys' room yet, and I creep people out in the ladies room. Why are there no neutral rooms
THIS!!!!! Like we all go to the bathroom why can‚Äôt everyone stfu. What also pisses me off is the ‚Äúmen will transition to steal ur children‚Äù line that transphobes use. If someone wants to steal ur kid bad enough they‚Äôre gonna do it ü§∑üèº
Saw two porta potties at a construction site the other day. One was labeled ‚ÄúWomen‚Äù and one was labeled ‚ÄúMen‚Äù. Porta potties. You can‚Äôt even fit more than one person in those things.
Agreed. Gendered bathrooms are an unnecessary waste of bathroom resources.
But when you do go in the right bathroom when passing sufficiently, ‚ú®euphoria‚ú®
I‚Äôm so with you! When I identified as a boy, I completely stopped using gender bathrooms and ONLY used family. I fucking hate public restrooms, not just for the gender but because they are disgusting. So many people, so many noises, it‚Äôs so uncomfortable.
Now that I‚Äôm transitioning, I can confidently use family restrooms more.
I just use the men's room and don't mind them any attention However I barely use restrooms anyhow 
Now sadly I do have an issue occasionally with my blater so I'm in I'm a bit embarrassed to say adult pull ups so if all else fails I have that 
But usually I just don't give them any care thankfully my city is very lgbtq friendly only a few homophobic people went to our recent youth pride event this month and many people helped shield the youth from them buttholes 
I am autistic if it helps understand why I just avoid public settings and bathrooms entirely as much as possible
have the same problem. makes me extremely uncomfortable using the women‚Äôs restroom but the men‚Äôs is terrifying. i once went to the mens restroom w a friend in high school, some other guys came in, and i hid in a stall and hyperventilated because i was scared of what would happen if they knew i was in there. we talk a lot about not wanting to use our ‚Äúassigned‚Äù bathroom but i don‚Äôt see many people talking about how terrifying the alternative can be.
And this is why I never use public restrooms, I just wait until I‚Äôm home to use the bathroom no mater how long I have to wait, I hate public bathrooms
And that's why i always use the non gendered handicap bathroom
gendered bathrooms actually arose from feminist protests for seperated bathrooms on the work floor. funny how we now want them gone again (which I also want as well)
I honestly think that in a few hundred years or so the notion of gendered restrooms will seem as ridiculous as segregating them by race to a large portion of society. They're built around the assumption of everyone being cishet and it's just dumb.
Man I always feel so bad usin the family restrooms but at the same time Ik it‚Äôs my best bet. I can‚Äôt nor won‚Äôt go in the mens cause I‚Äôm very clearly female and I don‚Äôt feel safe in them anymore. I‚Äôve already been sexually harassed by men a few times since comin out. The last thing I need is for that to happen in an enclosed private place cause I can‚Äôt defend myself beyond the 3 inch blade I take everywhere.

Women‚Äôa restrooms on the other hand have been pretty ok. I still get the odd look every once in awhile but that‚Äôs about it. Hell my family put up more of a stink when I use the womens bathroom than other women lol
This is one of the main things I still struggle with I do not know which bathroom to use.
Maybe I'm a bit extreme here, but to me, segregating bathrooms by gender feels awfully similar to segregating them by skin colour. Same narrative and everything.
Because historically men have been incredibly fucking creepy towards women.
They are the worst! I am scared of what might happen and try to avoid them at all costs.
There was this concept called 'separate spheres' and there were literally different restaurants and train cars and everything for men and women. It was during this time that the separate bathrooms came about. Part of the reason they stuck around was because they got enshrined I'm building codes. 

The latest version of the international building code allows for eliminating gendered bathrooms entirely but it may not be adopted by lower level entities (cities and counties and such).
Literally same, also with school bathrooms, I haven't once used a school bathroom since I started ;-;
My work only has gendered bathrooms so to avoid any issues I kinda just feel the need to suck it up and use the mens. I hate it along with the looks I generally get. Although my usual routine is go in and rush into a stall and if anyone else comes in I wait for them to finish up and leave. It is shitty I have to even do that but it‚Äôs the only way I feel safe if I really need to go. Otherwise I avoid public bathrooms like the plague
Now hold up, why we fucking public bathrooms all the sudden? I thought that was reserved for our s/o and toaster ovens
I (non-binary) had a similar experience just a few days ago. I had to go to a boring church event with my mother and I was wearing a blouse tied behind my back so my kind of developing abs were visible and of course I put my binder on and I also made a small packer out of socks that I put under my shorts.

 I kind of passed as a boy, but my mother told everyone we met I was a girl. At the women's bathrooms people were looking weird at me and told me to go to the men's. And so I did because I didn't want to make people uncomfortable, but at the men's bathroom I got a panic attack because everyone was looking weird at me and suddenly I wasn't passing anymore even though I told people I was two years younger than my real age . 
So I made it out of there as fast as possible. It was truly dreadful, because I literally had to pick a bathroom while I didn't belong in either of them. And this is why it is important for companies to place gender neutral bathrooms.
in my city, Delhi Metro opens toilets meant for people with disabilities to transgenders.
I do mainly avoid them not due to just that but most public restrooms are unhygienic and nasty here
I will say, however, as a hospo worker who has to clean the bathrooms, I could not imagine the mess men would make in a single consolidated bathroom. I cannot fucking STAND going into the men's bathroom at my job. As someone with a Willy it's so God damn easy to aim and not piss all over everything. To be fair I'd never sit on a public toilet so I can't just suggest to sit when you pee as I do at home. 

Don't get me STARTED on the pubes. Australian men are disgusting.
I expect it's cheaper to make two gendered group bathrooms then it is to reach the same capacity using just individual non-gendered bathrooms. Wish they would though, I hate gendered public bathrooms.
We need to have it gendered because  girls and boys need different things
I always feel so bad using the family ones, especially in big places like malls
I just don't use them anymore, they're pretty gross anyways. I only use single-use restrooms
We have gendered single bathrooms at my uni. (like actual single, not just separate stall comon sink/mirror).

I legit could not find any reason no matter how hard I think about it. But at least no one cares and just use the empty one regardless of gender. (at least most people I've encountered)
There‚Äôs a mall near me that‚Äôs the only place around that has a gender neutral bathroom. It‚Äôs in a bad area so you have to press a call button and camera for an employee to remotely open the door. The gendered bathrooms next to it don‚Äôt have this though. Weird. :(
Same.  Our work place has gender neutral bathrooms then this woman started working and made a huge fit over people leaving the seat up then they became gendered.  She is now gone so it back to normal.  Im not the most passable person without makeup so I get looked at no matter which one I use
I wish ***unisex*** toilets were everywhere
I just use the family ones. It‚Äôs a lot more private, too.
Bathrooms historically (from what Ive heard and read) were originally separated when more women started joining the work force. This was because of some sexjst shit that men made up, they thought women were quite ready for the ""real"" and ""harsh"" world so they made separate bathrooms for them.



I read a post about this and read some of an article from a Times website so I haven't looks too far into it so some parts could be slightly inaccurate.
This might be a hot take, but I have a theory we should separate based on needing to go 1 or 2 lmfao. Js
Honestly I feel this immensely. Being NB, I neither want to nor feel comfortable using gendered bathrooms. I hate that most places don't have neutral bathrooms, and I not a fan when the designated neutral bathroom is the disabled access bathroom, I always feel like it's shoving both trans and disabled people into the same half-assed acceptance corner. 

Whilst I'm seeing a lot more places in my city with neutral bathrooms, 9 times out of 10, I still have to confront the dysphoria of using the bathroom of my AGAB or just wait until I get home. Both feel completely demeaning.
I knowwwww.... I (AFAB NB) always go into the women's bc I feel like I'm the least likely to get drama that way but it always feels lowkey invalidating that I have to do that....

Always do what makes you feel most safe, and I agree that we should stop gendering the place you go to piss...
I hate how I know this is a joke but it actually makes sense
Out of context but cool username UwU
Historically men have often been super fucking creepy towards women.
genuinely...
My school has bathrooms labelled gender neutral but then they put a paper saying teachers only yet most teachers just use the regular bathrooms, I hate using the regular ones just like OP where they don‚Äôt feel comfortable enough.
Ya plus it‚Äôs single or two stalls most times so it‚Äôs not as anxiety as like the Walmart rest room is
Which is why I still use the men‚Äôs. Nothing better than strolling up to the urinal in a mini skirt and when people try to sidelong glance you just locking eyes with them and smiling. I‚Äôm using the one you told me to, deal with it.
Nah, while some people might think strategically like that, I'm sure *most* of these people just hate the trans so much they wouldn't want to have one in¬†""their"" bathrooms.
Technically speaking, no matter the disability u can still use it. (I learned it online and could b lying)
I mean handicapped stalls are there to be more convenient, but there‚Äôs nothing saying you can‚Äôt use one. As long as someone isn‚Äôt waiting behind you for the handicapped stall, I don‚Äôt really see an issue. It‚Äôs not like you‚Äôll be there longer than a few minutes, and if nobody else is in there, it‚Äôs not hurting anyone.
Ya the old women who use the main (most public) restroom at my work give me weird looks for the sheer fact that I‚Äôm binding and have short hair üòÇ
In that case its not trans women you should be afraid of, its creepy ass cis men üòë
They think that predators will see the small sign and think ""dammit, it's illegal to be there, guess I will not destroy the life of a random person after all...""
The womens porta potty comes with pink sewage water.
>You can‚Äôt even fit more than one person in those things.

I'm sure, if you try hard enough, you can even do three.
Like how does one classify that? Ik the single bathrooms at my work that r lablrd men and women r literally the same inside.
I've worked on construction sites and workers will literally use whichever is closest a lot of the time. The women's one is nicer sometimes, so guys will use it for that reason.
Problem is, i look like your average gaming nerd :/ I feel like people dont see me as a woman because i like video games
Yeah but i can also get segregating them, my girlfriend had a meltdown because the only bathrooms were gender neutral and the thought of a man standing outside her stall door freaked her the fuck out so i 100% can get it. Because AFAB‚Äôs dont feel comfortable being vulnerable around men becayse of the shit they deal with
This should be upvoted honestly. Take it from someone who has trauma, would hate to see a man outside my stall door
Thanks, I picked it out myself
I'm assuming they have them because some regulation forces them to? If so, take a photo of the sign saying ""teachers only"" and mail it to whomever is responsible for these things. Watch them take the signs down the next day.
My school has two gender neutral bathrooms in the office which are both labeled as the staff bathroom. Luckily, I'm allowed to use them instead of the gendered ones. I don't ever need to use the bathroom anyway but it made gym way more bearable
What a brave soul you are. I got harrased by men long before I even dressed like a woman or realized I was trans.
You are my hero
You're a brave one. I haven't used the men's for almost 2 years. I stopped the moment i passed well enough with a mask.
you are the woman i'm striving to once become
I think I just fell in love with u
I am talking about a societal level, not individual actors. That said, There is no meaningful difference between the two. Transphobia didn't spin up from nothing It is the result of the society we live in. The anti trans bathroom panic was CHOSEN as the focus of anti trans propaganda BECAUSE they bet that some cis ppl (primed by lifetimes of transphobic hegemony) would react strongly given the private/public nature of bathrooms. Whether or not people KNOW they've been led to anger by years of transphobic messaging and cultural momentum isn't important to the discussion imo.
That is true. But being trans isn't a disability.
It can be a moral dilemma. Like of your using one and someone needs the bathroom they are deprived of it etc.
exactly. that‚Äôs not a trans woman that‚Äôs a predator.
üíØ like idk how they come to conclusions
Literally lol
Only difference I could think of is a urinal in the ‚Äúmens‚Äù one but most porta potties have both a toilet and a urinal inside. The site was near a almost completed bridge that just got a new coat of concrete/asphalt so it‚Äôs not like there were tons of people working. One bathroom for each gender instead of two for everyone; how smart.
Makes sense. Just found it weird that labeled temporary porta potties that would probably only get used a few times. They‚Äôre literally plastic sheds with toilets in them.
Do people in the public bathroom know that you like videogames?
Screw those people. My cis wife and many other women love videogames and many even grew up playing videogames.
Okay, but change ""a man standing outside her stall"" to ""a black person standing outside her stall"" and see how that reasoning suddenly feels very yikes.
It‚Äôs got a lot of upvotes and downvotes actually. Seems to be a controversial comment. Not sure why people are downvoting it though. ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
Dead.
Same. I now use the woman's without a mask because I pass well enough.
It isn't really relevant to the solution, I just find it interesting to consider those aspects.
No ik lol but i mean like if I‚Äôm able I use those restrooms bc regular stalls are to tight and give me really bad panic attacks from my ptsd. So I feel if u have a reason it‚Äôs ok
That‚Äôs why I said if there was nobody else lol. Even if someone DID come into the bathroom needing the handicapped stall while you were using it, it wouldn‚Äôt take you more than a few minutes. Obviously if someone needs it more than you do, just go to a different stall, but I don‚Äôt really see a problem if it‚Äôs just you. I‚Äôve used my fair share of handicapped stalls while out walking with my son(I don‚Äôt feel comfortable leaving his stroller where I can‚Äôt see him so I bring it into the stall with me).
I don‚Äôt know if I just don‚Äôt frequent portapotties but I didn‚Äôt know they have urinals? They give me anxiety about falling in so I avoid them lol
Yeah. The state or a workers union often require them to have separate male and female bathrooms on the work site. Just another unnecessary step to, ""help"". People don't usually care until you get that one person who speaks up about not wanting to share with other genders.
Maybe i dunno
Yes but while race doesnt change your strength and stuff as much as your sex, she is 5‚Äô 3‚Äù while most men are 5‚Äô10‚Äù
Yeps, as soon as we could remove masks, I did. I was tired of them and wanted to try existing as me, which I didn't feel like I was doing with the facemasks.
Hate *is* a strategy.
Herein lies the ethical dilemma. Why should someone have to wait those few minutes for access to something that is for them. Also in many cases there is only one stall
Yeah I usually avoid them in general but it was always nice to know anyone was welcome in there. Nothing like a hot plastic box and a toilet to keep you company. Maybe some graffiti if you‚Äôre lucky.
I can see not wanting to share w other genders in shared bathrooms, but porta potties? So silly!
I think you‚Äôre overthinking this. Just go in, you‚Äôll see, it‚Äôs not that bad
Sooo... strength alone makes you violent and dangerous?
Thaz fair, I personally don't mind my mask. It's a cute design. I think it's a fashion type thing.

Used the men's bathroom for the first time AND got to take my senior picture in a tuxedo. Talk about a good day		"Glad you've used the mens, but sorry you had to go into that dirty place.
Any noticeable difference between the two that stick out to you? Do you feel a difference in the environment and how it's used?
You look great! Share those tux pics with us if you‚Äôre up for it :)
Man, you lucky, I hope I can start doing things like that once I come out (which I plan on doing very soon)
You look really good, dude!
Right on dude.
DUDE

you look great
Congrats, you look great!
I‚Äôm happy for you. Sorry that we don‚Äôt keep them very clean btw. I can‚Äôt wait to pass enough to use the woman‚Äôs restroom.
I forgot what subreddit this was and got really confused for a minute. You look great, dude!
I‚Äôm so glad you got to use the men‚Äôs room! Since i‚Äôm somewhat stealth at my school, i‚Äôm able to use the men‚Äôs bathroom without people saying anything, but i‚Äôm really happy you were able to use it mate:)
I didn't understand this post at first, but then I saw the subreddit. Lel.
Thought i was looking at black twitter lmao so good job brah
Well, the men's room is a lot quieter. Guys go in and go out alone where as groups of girls hang out in the women's bathrooms.


Another thing is that the men's toilets are disgusting and are actually lower at my school then the women's toilets. Can't tell you why. I personally feel far less stressed and anxious in the men's room, I would always feel my heart speed up and I'd start feeling incredibly uncomfortable when even approaching the women's bathrooms. Whereas with the men's it was as natural as walking into a different room, no stress at all.
I will for sure, soon as I get them in a few weeks :)
Right? I was like, ""Why is this cis dude so happy about the men's room?""

Talk about passing. Way to go, bro!
And hey! No more random blood on the stall walls!

Cue theme for ""The Twilight Zone"". I  never got the chance to revisit old places where i had so many unrequited thoughts, because my parents have sold the house i grew up in. I'm astounded at all the transwomen who talk of dressing up: for me, dressing up just made me utterly miserable and reminded me of what i was not. I wish i could have seen myself now then, because it would have been fun instead, knowing that this was going truly to be me!

A man addressed me in the bathroom today	"I'm a trans guy who doesn't pass. That's not a judgement on myself, just an unfortunate truth at the moment. Because of this, I was too nervous to use the men's restroom until like 9 months after coming out as trans. I was afraid of making cis men uncomfortable, but my my transfeminine friend assured me that men don't regard one another in the restroom the way women do. They just get in and out without interacting with each other. I've found this to be the case, up until today.

I was trying to get a paper towel from the machine when I heard someone behind me say, ""hey.""

I turned around nervously.

""Those don't work, but there's a roll under the sink.""

Relieved, I responded in my best masculine voice (think 13 year-old boy): ""Oh, thanks.""

""No problem, bro.""

Gender euphoria from a 3 second interaction about bathroom products? It's more likely than you think."	"Congratulations on getting that euphoric moment, my dude üòä
Yeah your transfem friend was definitely right
That title got me so nervous, I was sweating until I realized that it was a wholesome interaction, and not anything awful
> men don't regard one another in the restroom the way women do.

god, I swear the worst part of being a trans woman is getting used to people talking to you in the bathroom. just today, someone asked me how I was when I was drying my hands and I jumped, startled, said ""Im alright"" meekly (my voice *does not* pass) and ran tf out of there
that‚Äôs a nice moment. I‚Äôm glad you experienced that for the first time:)
I would curl up into a little ball if anyone talked to me in the washroom. But that would be nice.
As a cis man, I am too nervous to use public restrooms... Well done for you
OMG that's a dream! I just want to be called dude and bro all day! So happy for ya!
congrats bro. thats great
Here is the only rule you need to follow in the men's bathroom: Don't pee on the urinal right next to mine if there is no wall dividing us. That is literally it. Wanna pee on the fucking ceiling? As long as it doesn't hit me go ahead, who cares
I love this storyüòÇ
Broski scrolled back through your post history, found a selfie from 110 days ago. You‚Äôve been passing for at minimum 4 months lmfao.
Yo, dude, stay true to what you have. If some one calls you dude, bro, go with it. The most interactions I have had was just a nod. So go with it.
I gave you the 69th like üòé
That was how I felt throughout the interaction.
Wait, is this for real? I can't even interact with people normally as it is o_o; I'm never using a public restroom
Where tf do you live? I've been using women's bathrooms for 27 years and never had anyone talk to me.
I appreciate it, but I'm shorter than the average cis woman and have Boobs with a capital 'b.'
What are you even talking about?
Yeah, I'm not a fan of bathroom socializing either. The good news is that all you have to do in response is nod/smile/laugh to acknowledge the person and then move on. You don't have to engage. You can also just ignore them. But if ignoring them makes you uncomfortable, the nod and polite smile works wonders.
Ohio, USA, idk where you live but afaik it's common here for girls to go to the bathroom together and chat/put on makeup/just use the bathroom and talk to strangers
If that‚Äôs how you talk go with it. Interactions in the men‚Äôs restroom is to each. Just be more assertive with your voice."	pqyl4f	trans	683	1.0	2021-09-19 01:19:56
work and deadnames ü•≤	Hey all, I'm in the bathroom at work crying rn. I just came out to my new manager (i had come out to the previous one and he was super great and supportive however he left before any action could be taken), not only was she actively against it and trying to convince me I'm wrong for doing it but she refuses to try to make any changes until I change my name legally. She says I still have to refer to myself as my deadname on the phones and in emails and to customers, but, hey maybe the team will call me Bee instead infront of these same customers, actively outing me. Idk what to do or feel rn. I need this job and its not as easy as just leave. I just wanna keel over and die rn. I really don't know what to do, please help.	"Hold up. 
Call HR 
Tell the manager that‚Äôs illegal. 

There was just a federal case that made deadnaming illegal in the work place outside of legal stuff ie W2 or something like that. 
Name tags and reference to you are to be in your actual name not the government name. 

FULWOOD V. WALMART Is the case
Refer to yourself by only your chosen name and force her to take it through HR. Document everything.
If you're in the US, than I think that's illegal. If not, I'm not sure. Either way, that really sucks and I hope she shifts her tune. Stay strong
I‚Äôm really sorry that your in that situation. From personal experience the IT side of things can take a while even with supportive colleagues. (My network login is still included my deadname 12 months later, though my email address got updated super quick.)

Best recommendation I can offer would be to find out if you can talk to someone in HR directly about this. Even if there is some sort of hard rule in place about formally changing your name at work before a legal name change has gone through, there might be a way to have a ‚Äúpreferred‚Äù name set for you and documented.

There‚Äôs the potential, depending on where you are and what the laws are like, along with any company policies or statements you can find, that if she actively refuses to acknowledge who you are properly that you can either take legal action or report her to a higher manager/HR. Without knowing the sort of situation you‚Äôre in as far as the sort of support you‚Äôre likely to have, both in terms of other staff at work and friends/family outside it, you may not want to go that way. It‚Äôs a crappy situation, and I wish this didn‚Äôt have to be a factor, but consider how well you‚Äôll handle this if things don‚Äôt go well. If you do go down that path, document everything, and see if you can get a colleague (or several) to corroborate much of what‚Äôs happening as possible. 

I hope you‚Äôre able to find a solution to all of this quickly. Always keep in mind to look after yourself. Good luck my friend!
In australia harassing or discriminating against someones gender is against the law and they can be sued if u have evidence
Tell her and HR she is creating a hostile work environment. HR will shut her up real quick. Also, after every conversation you have with her on the subject, send an email recapping the conversation so you have a paper trail.
You're manager's behavior is probably illegal. Stay strong hun. We are rooting for you and love you.
Hey do NOT keel over and die! Get up and fight like hell!! You CAN DO THIS! I believe in you!

1) Take the rest of the day off. Throw up all over your workstation if you have to but go home sick. You're in no condition to spend any more time there today.

2) Print out any relevant emails, preserve any recordings, memos, screenshots of IMs, letters, and make notes of conversations with dates & times & names. Based on the evidence, do you have a strong case? Depends on your jurisdiction but talk to a lawyer or several.  

3) Is your boss also the CEO or private owner of the company? If you're dealing with some stupid middle-manager, take this issue to their boss and see what they think. Take it to HR. HR's whole job is to make sure the company doesn't get sued. They'll want a chance to deal with this situation before it escalates to the point where employees are crying in the bathroom and vomiting at/on their desks and googling labor attorneys.
As a manager of people I have had 3 trans employees to date (out of about 5000). I'm not hugely informed about trans issues but then that's why I am here.

All 3 were great engineers, I don't hire anything else. All 3 quietly got on with life and shared their story with their colleagues. One I found out when he went from Ali to Alan and someone addressed him as such. Your colleagues should be far more understanding especially if you have been there for a while. 

One (M2F) asked for some help to come out to the workforce. the function was around 1100 people and they wanted to manage the news. I still didn't really need to know a huge amount about trans issues. The same basic human kindness that I would like for myself applied and we got there while maintaining our project deliverables.

OP you need HR rather than your line manager here. They can show you how to change your name & Email. Don't get all passive agressive with your boss as you will end up miserable. take their power away by following the process to achieve what you want. 

Customers wont know or care over much what name you use as long as you are helping them. 

&#x200B;

good luck
This is workplace discrimination based on gender, which is illegal. She's created a hostile work environment for you, which you can take up with HR. You have more power here than you think. You don't technically have to put your legal name on *anything* except official legal documents. And she can't do anything about how you refer to yourself over the phone, on emails, or in person. Legally, she can't fire you for that because she knows it's discrimination, which is why she'll probably make your work a living hell until you quit on your own. Don't give her that, and report her to whoever you can, and double down on going by your actual name.

She has no right as a person or as your boss to tell you how you can address yourself. She has no right to enforce her BS it when the law is quite literally on your side and she knows it. She even tried to tell you you're wrong in this? Her telling you all this is pulled straight out of her ass, and I'm sorry she's caused you so much pain.

Something I usually tell transphobic people is, ""I don't really care if you see me as a man or a woman. But if you honestly still see me as __ and you're treating me like shit over it, your sexist, plain and simple.""
I would say stand your ground. You don‚Äôt need to have your name legally changed to go by it. I would probably attach a side note to your emails like *name change in progress* kind regards and then your preferred name and your preferred pronouns If that helps with the confusion. You should have some information in your contract about transitioning at work? Trans people are usually protected but depends where you are.
Unfortunately there will be always one like her!
To parrot others, start with HR but remember that HR is going to keep the company‚Äôs interested in mind first. If you don‚Äôt get anywhere with them, or they seem like they are going to retaliate against you then go to your city/county/state labor board and make a complaint. 
Again, the rules change depending on the country you are in.
Document everything, screen shots, dated prints, get your manager's refusal to address you by your real name in writing. Have those documents in a place they can't be deleted: a physical copy you take home and a virtual copy such as saving the emails from the manager and overall management into a dedicated folder in your email provider, preferrably personal email and not work email. Look into your local laws on work discrimination, bullying and harrasment in the work place based on gender. Keep those sources somewhere you can find them. If they protect trans individuals you can bring up that what your manager is doing is literally illegal. Otherwise just stick to the bullying aspect of it and go for empathy with HR. Anyway, bring it up with HR, give them copies of the evidence you gathered, the screenshots and emails. Give them some time to respond, if they do something about it, give them like a month to deal with it, start asking after it if nothing seems to change, and if they refuse to help threathen them with going to a lawyer about it and if that doesn't help, go consult a lawyer if you can afford one, though many offer these first visits to talk over the potential case for free and some even work on getting a cut from the fines/settlement the company will have to pay to you if they're confident enough on your case.
new job
Wow. She needs training. Anyway, your mistake was being too nice and doing it in person, email always
That definitely sounds like it was illegal. I‚Äôd try to take it to HR or find a lawyer
IDK what country you‚Äôre from. I can only speak to America. 

Tell HR. 

This is discrimination. Your manager is breaking federal law. You could sue the company for this. There is an HR dept for exactly this reason. 

Tell HR.
Don‚Äôt respond to them trying to get your attention with your deadname
Just go work somewhere else and only tell people the name you want to be called by except the HR forms
I had this happen a few months back at my new job. If at all possible: go to HR. Idk how it is there, but my HR rep made sure that action was taken swiftly and sternly. I have been thinking about going to HR again lately, because even with corrections daily, my coworkers have slipped into deadnaming me and misgendering me in private and to customers again.
Document document document. Get it all in writing and get it to HR or go above her if you have to. That is a form of gender based discrimination and harassment and is not legal in the work place.
Hey DM me I've had to deal with similar stuff before, I'll tell you how to document stuff to make it easy for Lawyer person to read.
It seems you‚Äôre in Australia, so the first step is to see if there‚Äôs someone over your current manager, such as HR, to help. If they refuse, Australia has people report cases to their [Human Rights Commission](https://www.ag.gov.au/rights-and-protections/human-rights-and-anti-discrimination/australias-anti-discrimination-law), which varies based on your territory. Be sure to document everything, and good luck!
Report to HR, that person should not be a people manager if they don't know how to deal with people. We're all just people and should be treated no differently to any other. It's absolutely disgusting what they said. 
HR will go to town on them, if they're any good!
Best of luck xxx

omg hi Bee, i‚Äôm Bea!
Which company? (Dm it if you don‚Äôt want to post it publicly) A lot of them have corporate policies against this now on top of it being legally questionable.
holy fuck this is fucked up on so many levels

OP you should NOT have to deal with this one supervisors bigoted bullying

go over their head, much love and luck to you
yeah that's discrimination and they can get sued for that shit
I wish it was that easy, the email address I have to use still has my deadname attached and I cannot remove it unfortunately. I don't necessarily want to out myself as trans to customers
And it seems to me it‚Äôs totally illegal in France too but not sure

Edit : yes it is. Excerpt from a big French newspaper called Lib√©ration : ‚ÄúDepuis 2012, la l√©gislation fran√ßaise est claire : en France, toute discrimination en raison de l'identit√© de genre est ill√©gale. Et cela vaut aussi dans le monde du travail.‚Äù

English translation : Since 2012, French legislation is clear : In France, any discrimination based on gender identity is illegal. This also prevails at work‚Äù
THIS! Even if they are in the most stressful situation: it's still not an excuse, and I will ignore them just to prove a point.
What????? How out of touch to try and make a joke here. She is literally being harassed (in many areas actively being hate crimed) by upper management plz take it seriously! üò§
the ‚Äúdocument everything‚Äù part of this advice holds true, if nothing else. get it in writing *somewhere* that you‚Äôve asked your manager to change how they address you and they‚Äôve actively refused to do so. even if that‚Äôs just a private 1:1 email thread or slack message or however your office communicates. you‚Äôre stuck with your email address for now (although depending on the company you could consider going to corporate about this) but you‚Äôve told your manager who you are and ‚Äúyour email address still says X‚Äù is not a legally justifiable excuse to misgender you.

(disclaimer: ianal and depending on the country/state I dont know 100% whether you can count on the legal system to help you. you SHOULD find a lawyer in your area who offers consultations if that‚Äôs free/within your means. I think you have a strong case here if that‚Äôs what it comes to. )
Submit a change of email request to HR yourself. HR will get things sorted fast. Your manager has no say in this.
Stay cute hun it'll get better üòä
SAVE IT ALL ON ANY FORM OF MEDIUM THAT THEY CAN‚ÄôT DELETE.

Good call. I wasn‚Äôt aware of that!"	x1cks3	trans	614	0.98	2022-08-30 07:21:44
Can‚Äôt post on AITA because ‚Äútrans bad‚Äù- AITA for cutting off my mom after my Father and Brother treat me like a predator after coming out as trans.	"Hi, I am a 33 year old born female who came out as trans-masc during the pandemic. I got top surgery and am on hormone therapy and have been living my life as my true self. 

Well, when I tried to tell my family things were not easy. My mother didn‚Äôt want to use my preferred name so I gave her a second option but she continues to misgender me and not use the preferred names I have given. She recently bought a bottle of wine with my dead name on it during thanksgiving and presented it to me like I would appreciate it since my dead name spelled differently is a man‚Äôs name in another language. 

I laughed it off and kept asking when the kids were going to arrive. Since I was told they were coming down despite my brother and I having a huge argument because he refuses to tell me where his new house is and I am not allowed to visit. My brother 34 has 4 children now and the new baby was welcomed in August. I have not met this baby, (her middle name is a Harry Potter Character) but I brought her a gift in an attempt to make peace. I have no issues with his wife other then her spineless attempts to excuse my brothers bigotry because he has said out loud he doesn‚Äôt want me talking to his kids about sex. When I was only coming out as a trans man to them.

To understand better, with the first two kids I was changing their diapers. Playing with them for hours on end and the oldest misses me dearly. This was when I was in the closet. Baby 3 was born during the pandemic and I wanted to visit but they barred me from the house claiming Covid. 

Well my brother didn‚Äôt show up for thanksgiving, but I called the next day and he was there with the kids. I heard the oldest ask who was on the phone.  They didn‚Äôt answer her, I felt like a stranger holding the phone to my ear hearing them all play and celebrate the holiday without me. 

I made plans to return home to cut my moms hair the next day. However I was talking to a local trans artist and decided to confront my mom about what happened. 

What followed was a heart breaking phone call about my mental health and how it has declined to depression, isolation and grief. We are still mourning the loss of my oldest brother who died after thanksgiving in 2015. He would have accepted me. Now My mom feels like she is loosing another child. 

But, when I confronted my dad over the phone he proceeded to not only miss gender me and refused to call me by any name. he told me that my brother doesn‚Äôt see me as anything but his sister and that they are struggling to understand because all they see me as their little girl. my dad has continuously left me out of any of the activities with my brother I wasn‚Äôt allowed to go fishing wasn‚Äôt allowed to go golfing and when I would join them they always complained that I was slow and I couldn‚Äôt keep up and there was always a gang mentality of ‚Äúlittle girls‚Äù can‚Äôt play with the boys.

My dad told me in the car that gender affirming surgery would be a Mutilation of my body. 

My dad told me MY BROTHER DOESN‚ÄôT SEE THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN GENDER AND SEXUALITY

i strongly believe my dad is to blame here. So I told my mom I will never be returning home again. She cried and asked me what she can do to help. I don‚Äôt think anything can be because I can‚Äôt trust my brother or father ever again. AITA?

Update: thank you all for your support I have been revolving around the guilt of coming out and it‚Äôs good to know that I deserve to be treated better. Also my sister in law texted me thanking me for the gift against the wishes of my brother so I‚Äôm thinking I‚Äôve struck a nerve finally.

Update 2: So after blocking my father and mother from contacting me. My dad showed up unannounced to drop off my snow tires and apologize for snapping on me over the phone. Apparently he sent me an email but I blocked him long ago because his last apology was just more bigotry hidden within manipulative apologetic behaviour. I had my fianc√© talk to him and deal with the tires while I cried on my patio. 

My brother says The reason he won‚Äôt let me see the kids. Is all I talk about is drama and trans stuff. And I don‚Äôt take the time to talk to them about positive things. 

It‚Äôs absolutely nuts to think I would be so stupid to fall for this. They are uncomfortable with me being transgender and don‚Äôt want me to talk about it at all even though I only came out at 30 and I just turned 33 in September. 

I have had little contact with them over Covid and saw my brother once since the start of the pandemic. He doesn‚Äôt respond to text messages to me and when he does it‚Äôs always drama because he doesn‚Äôt invite me to family event he gets our mother to invite me. Mom had to fight for me to be involved in his wedding.  He‚Äôs bullied me since I was a baby (in the youngest of 3 our older brother passed away in 2015) his wife was the only one who would share pictures or stories of the kids over text because they don‚Äôt use social media. I admit i have snapped at him repeatedly, but I know it‚Äôs from being gaslit. He‚Äôs the one who showed our neighbour how to unlock the bathroom door while I was using it."	"You transitioning wasn‚Äôt what made them ‚Äúlose another child‚Äù it was the way they treated you.
NTA by far.
NTA - always cut people out of your life who harm you.
100% NTA. If your family can't support and affirm you, they don't get to spend time with you. Natural consequences. Boundaries like this have really helped with my family.
NTA - It‚Äôs okay to not want to be around people who hurt you. Even if those people are related to you by blood.
NTA misgenderers get the yeet
NTA at all
Nah, family isn‚Äôt the end all be all. I hope you can find a better family for yourself
Not at all , not seen my family In over 8 years because of it and I've been mentally better off ever since
They have no rights to your well-being once they become the reason your being isn‚Äôt well. You want some internet parents r/momforaminute and r/dadforaminute are both places I have had success with even when I made it clear I‚Äôm trans both have love unconditionally as a rule so you can report transphobia to mods
When she cried, you should have told her - gender you correctly, strictly, 100 percent of the time. If she hesitated then cut her out with no mercy. 


But this works too. 

Nta. Obviously.
NTA - family is hurtful and you. Need. To. Cut. All. Of. Them. Off!
NTA.

Family deserves an extra few chances, but you GAVE them LOTS of chances and they royally fucked up. Leave em, at least for a while.
Hate to say it, but your family is full of ignorant transphobes.

Your one and only answer to your mother should be ‚Äúyou all had exactly two options. Acceptance or rejection. You all chose rejection. Real genuine acceptance, and educating yourself on what being transgender actually is, is the only way any of you will ever see me again.‚Äù
No, go live your own life with someone who loves you
Self preservation is NOT SELFISH. You did what YOU needed. YOU DESERVE PEACE. Your job first and foremost is to live your life for yourself.
NTA, even though family: this behavior is not acceptable.

I am sorry for you. Best wishes!
NTA - Just because they're blood doesn't mean they're family. A family loves you, cares about your well-being, wants you to be happy, and, most importantly, **RESPECTS YOU**!! From the description, they've done none of that. They're just blood-relatives/ kin.
NTA - All I see is a story about how your family thinks they own you and the choices you make for yourself. If they feel like they're losing a child, it's not because they're worried about you, it's because they're losing their power over you. They want to guilt trip you into being what they want out of their kid, not what's right for you. They can either learn to accept it or get cut out because their toxicity will only be a drain on you.
NTA. Passively letting people be horrible bigots to you is not acceptable from someone who claims to be family.
NTA - your family is incredibly rude and not supportive. they have no right to treat you like that.
You can't make AITA posts about being trans?
Definitely NTA!! Cut toxic people out of your life!
Nta. Still hurts though im sorry
You know what every time that cis men have left me out and been toxic like that I realized I didn‚Äôt even want to be associated with their values so I ended up being okay with them not accepting me. Idk if that makes sense but it makes sense in my head. Basically I‚Äôm sorry that you have faced so much rejection. Just know that there are really wonderful people and wonderful uplifting men that will accept you out there.
sorry, what does NTA and AITA mean? üßç
NTA, you are finally getting to be yourself, they don‚Äôt have the right to weaponize that against you to appease their bigotry.
Nta. Your fam =TA
Are they really that transphobic on other subreddits?
Wait does AITA have a ‚ÄúTrans Thing‚Äù? This is the first i heard of such a thing
NTA. You‚Äôve gone out of your way to connect and reconnect and to offer patient explanations to people who have done nothing to deserve it. The idea that the loss of your oldest brother somehow justifies this is just‚Ä¶ appalling. Your family has the opportunity to keep a real, living relationship with one of its members, and they‚Äôre just going to light that on fire, because you won‚Äôt sign off on their mistreatment of you? 

You deserve better than that.
Cut them all off. If they can‚Äôt accept you for you, they lost a wonderful son.
You are so NTA! Them miss gendering fills me with rage. Parents are allowed to mourn the person they thought you were but then need to move on. You are being your true self. You do not need those negative people in your life treating you like you are less than. Sometimes you have to make a different family with friends who love you as the wonderful person you are.
NTA.
NTA and your relatives suck.
I was also not allowed to post there for the same reason.
If I was in your shoes, I‚Äôd be cutting them out of my life completely until they can respect and use your pronouns and real name.
You‚Äôre still alive. They‚Äôre mourning their concept of you. Happy you‚Äôre loving your truth, brother. NTA
NTA you don't want that toxicity in your life
Had to cut my toxic and racist family as well nta totally agree üëçüíØ NTA.
NTA. if they want their perfect idea of their little daughter more than they want their actual child, the idea is all they deserve.
NTA
All that extra text was unnecessary, title was enough. NTA, never were or will be
I'm so sorry for you being cut off from the children here. I have a brother that cut off my entire side of the family (not related to my transition or anything else), so I have a niece and nephew that I didn't get to see grow up.

You're absolutely not wrong for protecting yourself from these people, though. You don't owe them anything despite what they think.

Some people will always see you as the version of yourself they had the most control over. Especially if you allow them to control you in any way. Setting firm boundaries is important, and starting with a boundary of cutting them off completely is completely rational.

Jfc, I can't believe your your brother won't even tell you his address. What a fucking asshole.
This sounds really toxic. You might tell your mom at least that what she can do to help is use your name and gender you correctly. I don't think your an asshole for not wanting to go back to that environment, though.

Put it this way, you're cutting out your family but they're also choosing to cut out you by being shitbags about this. That's on them, not you. You aren't obligated to take emotional abuse from anyone, family or not.
NTA, and i would cut your family out of your life.  as hard as that might be, it's worth it for your mental health.
NTA. Sounds like your mom wants you to stick around while allowing your brother and dad to treat you with absolute disrespect

What can she do? She can have a discussion with her husband and her son otherwise she *will* lose another child. See how important it really is to them
NTA, and you don't need your mom if she enables/ignores their gross behavior
They're the assholes.  I am sorry.  Family that turn you away are horrible, and sometimes cutting them out of your life is what you have to do in order to be happy.  If your mom is worth holding on to.  I would just plan on keeping phone contact and maybe doing some outings with her each year.  Separately.  As for the rest of the family.  I would cut them out and leave it up to them to change their minds.  If they truely are worth interacting with then perhaps they will over time sulking in their own shit.  But otherwise I wouldn't worry one second of my life what they think about you.  I've had to cut close family out of my life and it SUCKS.  But I'm better for it and happier at the end of the day
It sounds like this doesn't have anything to do with your transition, your dad is just a sexist pig. NTA.
Am I the asshole blocks certain things that are deemed ‚Äòcontraversial‚Äô

So often it‚Äôs related to several areas such as sex (like the physical act) gender, race and other issues that are ‚Äòhot‚Äô at the moment
not the asshole period, its mature to set your boundaries you did the right thing
NTA

The blood of the brotherhood is thicker than the water of the womb.

Find your real family and cut those bio assholes out of your life.
NTA: if mom wants to help she needs to get herself and the whole family therapy and accept you for who you are 

Everything else has pretty much already been said: cut them off until they can prove to you they've changed. Personally I'd give it like a few years at minimum

Also as a side note I knew AITA was a big online community and wouldn't be the friendliest to trans ppl but damn I didn't know they're that much of a dick
Definitely NTA. You get to decide who gets to be part of your life, and if your family refuses to accept you as who you are, you have every right to cut them out
NTA - trans or otherwise, you don't owe anyone your life. If someone in your life is making it so that you feel like life is unmanageable or too hard, you are always allowed to take your space with or without warning, with or without explanation, etc. I had to cut my own family off when I was 20 because they also told me trans bad, and I knew I needed time to figure out what I wanted and who I am, and that to do this I had to stop hearing all those bitches in my head that sound *just like me*, but want me dead. I needed a silent room, or at least one without all those echos and feedback sounds, ever the painful reminder me who definitely wasn't.

Remember: you are too important to not live and be true. It's not just about you. It is Us, right now, the people who are alive and have a voice, one of the few peoples who can change the world by simply being ourselves. And we ARE responsive for changing the world for the better, not just as a minority, but as human beings who is a part of this world and wish to find peace while still in it.

Please believe that you deserve to be surrounded by *only* loving people who respect you. That should be your bare minimum for allowing a person into your life from now on, you'll feel a lot better a lot faster if you don't have to work against the grain inside that head of yours. Cognitive dissonance does not have to be your neutral state anymore. Being trans isn't a choice, but loving yourself is, and it is so worth it when you finally start to feel it. I'm 23 now, and about 2 months ago I finally realized I am no longer plagued with suicidal ideations, in fact, I now want to live. I deserve to live, and to have my chance at happiness too, damn it, and you do too. You are so deserving of love. I wish you all the best
NTA. Your mental health is worth the stress. Sometimes stuff like this makes people change. Other times, you are relieved of being around it. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this.
So sorry to hear you have to go through that. If you have any patience left, pull it out because you‚Äôll need it - so many people are ignorant and misinformed. Time and distance really do heal things. Give it time also., on your part to be who you are and on their part to wrestle with their own ignorance.
First of all, NTA. Second of all, that sub sucks major dick, especially recently. The mods are overzealous as fuck.
See this is a weird one cuz it kinda seems like your mom's atleast trying but your dad and brother are making it impossible. I'd almost ask is there a way to keep contact with mom but cut out dad and brother but probably not
I don‚Äôt need to read the context of this to conclude that you are NOT the asshole. That shit is not acceptable, and you deserve to associate yourself with people who support you.
NTA and you don't owe any of them a relationship. You deserve better than to be treated like that.
NTA, in fact, they are assholes for treating you like crap, I would honestly stop trying to make amends with them if I were you tbh
Your brother and dad are abusive.
Maybe you can continue a relationship with your mom, just not in that house?
Best case scenario is getting through a bit to your mom but that seems mentally taxing so idk
NTA, my family only started to accept that I was trans when I cut them off. They saw just how much happier I was without them and how much healthier I was living as myself. Theres still some strain there but they are trying. 



You may need to be a bit more understanding about how they feel like theyre losing a kid, my family felt the same, but its not your responsibility to hold their hand. If they want you back they fix their shit. Until then get a breath of fresh air, and try and stay positive. 



Your mom sounds a lot like mine, and my mom has been a fight to get on my side but a rock once she was. It may not seem like it but the different ver of ur name is likely a sign shes starting to take baby steps forward. Since my mom would 100% kick the asses of my dad and brothers (figuratively) if they were causing her to lose me I think yours very well could do the same.
NTA they‚Äôre treating you as sub human and making themselves pissed. All by making up/listening to untrue reasons, to justify their knee jerk reaction of discomfort. You deserve so much better then people that are unwilling to make you feel loved. Especially if it would only cost them slight discomfort to understand you.
this! ^ NTA
this
absolutely they should NTA
Over the phone I was gentle, but followed up with a text message with very direct language about my name and gender and that they need to learn to respect the trans community
You can
AITA - ‚ÄúAm I The Asshole?‚Äù
NTA - ‚ÄúNot The Asshole‚Äù
AITA - Am I the asshole

NTA - Not the asshole
This is code from the subreddit ‚Äúam I the asshole?‚Äù (AITA) and NTA means ‚Äúnot the asshole‚Äù.
AITA: Am I The Asshole?

NTA: Not The Asshole

There is a sub based around asking reddit if you made the jerk moves or if it was other people (or both/neither), OP apparently had trouble with that sub and came here to ask instead.

In this case OP did absolutely nothing wrong, his family are just assholes hence people are saying that he is ""not the asshole"".
AITA: Am I The Asshole

NTA: Not The Asshole

ATA: Am The Asshole
‚ÄúNot the asshole‚Äù and ‚Äúam I the asshole‚Äù
NtA- not the asshole 
AITA- am I the asshole
NTA = not the asshole, AITA = am I the asshole
Not the asshole 

Am I the asshole, its a sub reddit where people ask if they were an ass in a situation or not or if someone else is.
Subreddit ‚Äúam I the asshole‚Äù

Answer ‚Äúnot the asshole‚Äù
damn reddit didn‚Äôt give me the notifs, also thank you all üëç
Oh god yes. Any trans-related post in literally any subreddit that‚Äôs not trans-specific gets swarmed by transphobes.
The censorship on that board is unbelievable
That's awful
Yea it kinda blows. I find the best way to deal with it (aside from just avoiding all non-trans subs) is to make fun of them and make them look stupid so people take them less seriously. It‚Äôs usually pretty easy cuz they generally don‚Äôt expect trans people or their allies to do stuff like that."	y3t6ij	trans	601	0.98	2022-10-14 12:53:30
My school just closed all the gender neutral bathrooms and made them teacher only, what now?		"That's just malicious.
Time to pick, or use the teacher's bathroom.

Personally, I was always a smartass. I'd use the teacher's bathroom until they said something, then start using the bathroom for my identity. Then just keep bouncing between the two if they keep saying no. I'd make it a whole thing with my actions and not words.

BUT! It's up to you what you really wanna do~

Either way, it's not the end of the world.
Damn, that sucks. Are you in a red state/city? Would it help at all to complain? I'm hoping this wasn't done intentionally to harm, but I worry ü´Çü´Ç
Label every bathroom gender neutral
Organize all of the students who are upset at this. Contact parents as well. Try and get some local lgbt org in your city involved. work out how you guys can agitate for better treatment.
Use them. Or the ones that match your gender. They may not even say anything but if they do, contact the aclu. Or see if you can get a lawyer from the blue area to take the case? We were prepared to do this at my sons school.
WTF do they expect people to do???

Oh well, I guess it's time to use the principal's office as a toilet. Just poop right on their desk. They'll get the memo.
I‚Äôd use the teachers bathroom and convince everyone to do so as well. Don‚Äôt let the primitives win‚Ä¶
Adapt and overcome. Become the teacher!
Well that isn‚Äôt exactly fair :/
I don't wanna get too personal, but, follow my intent from the malicious compliance perspective.

I've inferred that you're gender neutral, is that correct?

If you're AFAB, use the gents. Just to burn their phobic little brains. And every now and then used the ladies just to fuck around with them a little more.

If you're AMAB, same but in reverse.
Walk into the teachers. Cause chaos. Do crime. They can‚Äôt jail us all. This will always be my message.
Sneak into the teachers bathrooms that‚Äôs what the trans kids do at my school. Usually the cis kids don‚Äôt care enough to snitch. Just don‚Äôt get caught by security or a teacher having a bathroom emergency because usually they don‚Äôt go to the bathroom during class but during passing periods. Just make sure you don‚Äôt get caught and don‚Äôt go during a passing period.
Sue. All you gotta do is find one intersex gif or kid with an X on their birth certificate as a plaintiff and bam, school is in trouble.
Shit on the Principle's desk. Establish dominance.
Use it or ask the office/admin if you can use it (if you‚Äôre safe to do so). There‚Äôs a possibility they closed it from bigoted parents but wouldn‚Äôt mind a few students using it bc of their identity.
guess you a teacher now
Shit on the principals desk. 

Don‚Äôt actually, but that‚Äôs a real shitty move on their part
I'm having a similar problem at my school! They've all been closed for months now because of ""Vandalism"", and they have no plans of reopening them, it's so irritating now I have to walk across my campus to the office and ask someone in there to unlock a staff bathroom for me to use the restroom. I hate it.
I'd talk to the counselor about how you don't feel safe going in the gendered ones. I talked to my counselor about it and they're letting me use the teacher bathrooms :)
Be a menace. Gum up the locks so they *have* to remove them.
New gender unlocked: teacher
Coin flip and act like you belong there?
Idea! Piss on the desks of the people who did that
The health office should have gender neutral ones, and some classrooms have small single bathrooms for the classes (at least where I went). See what the office building has‚Ä¶. I‚Äôm sorry they did that to everyone there üòî
Ask if teacher is a neutral gender. If they say no, then tell them that they should use the boys and girls bathrooms like everyone else then until they put the gender neutral ones back.
Shit on the teachers desk. Assert your dominance.
If you want something done, then complain.
Complaints at a school are heard in the following order
1) Parents. If your parents or the parents of your friends are supportive, have them call (or write) the office to undo that.
2) Teachers. If you have or know of supportive teachers, have them complain to the principal. The school may have a committee where teachers help to make decisions. If you find out who is on that, you can talk to them.
3) Students. You can complain. Walk into the office and say you want to talk to the principal about it. Ok that one is scary as heck, get a group of friends and write a petition and get people to sign it.
That's absolutely ridiculous. Just wipe ""inclusive environment"" off their rep
Time for an organized protest/walk out.
my school closed down the neutral bathrooms on the main floor, making me go all the way up to the third floor just to pee

apparently people were having sex in there or whatever and instead of dealing with the sex havers or whatever they just made it so i can‚Äôt pee in peace
Hey sister/brother something i always did in school when the genderless bathrooms were locked/used, I‚Äôd go to the nurse since they almost always have a bathroom. The nurse can‚Äôt really stop you from going to the bathroom anyways, and it‚Äôs usually just a single toilet. My schools always had tons of extra stuff in there like clothes or menstrual products, but you‚Äôre guaranteed that privacy.
Guess there's no where else to go except the principals coffee pot. >:D
Go in the teachers only bathroom
I‚Äôm sorry that‚Äôs happened. Maybe talk to the principal or someone in charge about making an exception due to special circumstances?
This happened to one of my friends.  Students were having sex in the gender neutral washrooms, which I guess is a decent reason?

They had to ask the office for a key to get into the washrooms, but that was all.  See if you can do the same, if that's a safe option for you.
Keep using them to protest
Two options:

Chaotic Neutral: Use the womens and let the complaints roll in.

Chaotic Evil: Piss in the mens urinal in a long dress.

Edit for third option - Chaotic Good: petition the district and rally your classmates. You outnumber them 1000:1
I know there's only one gender neutral bathroom back at my school. It was in sick bay in the front office, which was a disabled bathroom. 

Same in Primary School, there were only 2. A teacher one and one in the sick bay. Though these are old schools and are open instead of being in one building.
I mean what you now have to do is go to what ever gender you look like unfortunately I‚Äôm really sorry this happened
Just pee in the gendered bathroom you assign to yourself. Keep doing it against any pressure if possible.
I think I used the restroom 3 times during my entire time at high school. I was still totally in the closet, but I fucking HATED those hell holes. I know it was more than 3, but not many, and if I did have to go, I would always try to do it during class, so there wasn't anyone else there.
Girls bathroom is a decent alternative, *mostly* clean, pretty quiet, no urinals, it's nice, keep in mind that the girls bathroom had more vape fiends on average from my totally extensive research.

But if you pee on the walls, clog the toilet with toilet paper, and/or poo in the urinals, then you belong in the boys bathroom (for everyone's safety)
I just hate it.

The school I work in gendered the teachers' bathrooms. Fucking hell.

I have no fucking idea what to do and I'm so sorry you need to go through this.
Half of the all gender bathrooms at my school are staff only but the staff dont fucking listen and they use the student ones even though the staffines are right next too it and almost always say vacant
Sue?
It‚Äôs like 2013 again
No!   Go to your counselor or someone you can trust saying your bodily functions are necessary and you need a bathroom you can go to and not ‚Äúupset‚Äù other students.  Maybe they can designate one for all trans or just use girls one.
Contact a local reporter and see what happens
Contact the ACLU. My district had to settle their lawsuit out of court over this very same issue.
take a shit infront of one
Everyone is saying to pick them.  I found a wikihow online about picking locks with bobby pins.  It‚Äôs really not hard.
use the teacher‚Äôs bathroom, they don‚Äôt deserve privileges anyways
Ask your teachers, specifically ones that you‚Äôre close to and know about your stuff. That would be the best option.
[removed]
Time to be a rule breaker.
That's such bullshit.
Use it anyway. Fight the power, embrace chaos
SAME. except for 2 but they don‚Äôt have doors on them :(
You could just ask the school if you can use the bathrooms to? That‚Äôs what the college I work for does
I would pop a squat in the principals office. But then I'm a twisted witch.
First, if the bathrooms aren‚Äôt locked just use them. If anyone gives you shit for using just shrug and say you didn‚Äôt know they changed you‚Äôve been using the bathroom all year. If they‚Äôre locked I‚Äôd talk to your guidance counselor, if you feel safe doing so. My moms a middle school guidance counselor, they always just meets students at the bathrooms between classes or whenever they come to her office and unlock it for them.
your school had gender neutral bathrooms?
My school has been the same for a while other the an one in the nurses office...
Piss and shit in the teachers office/break room. Alternatively, if the doors aren‚Äôt actually locked, just use the bathrooms like normal. Fek em.
When I need a toilet, I find and use a toilet. Take away the toilets and I'll go outside like an animal, or maybe on someone's leg if I think they had something to do with the lack of toilets.

Sorry to be glib but JFC I'm sick of these fascists trying so damn hard to be the biggest assholes imaginable.
I don't know about your school, but the nurse will probably have a single person restroom, and if not, they can unlock the teacher's one for you.
Just do the lgbt thing and Use them anyway.
Are you able to go in anyway?
Ugh, I hate when schools do that- Mine tried to do that, but god pushback from the district so they had to reopen at least half of them- but they only reopened the ones in the most inconvenient locations. As a disabled student with a weak bladder, I'd rather not walk 10 minutes to use the bathroom!
I use the women‚Äôs restroom and I am not even on HRT yet.. only had someone say something a few times.. though did have a little girl freak out and thought I was playing a joke.. ü§≠ü•¥
Continue to use them
Seems malicious to that.
State should override their bs. Wonder if a class action suit would work for other people affected by this bigot bs.
Guess you're a teacher now!
Just ask what to do and adapt to doing it. Im preop amab transfem and I almost always use the men's bathroom.  Nobody ever questions it. They also are too busy using the toilet to care. And even if they don't like it, what are they gonna do? Pee/poop on the floor to get to reach me and hurt me? Ha. Bring it on, slippery toilet feet!
Do you know if this was a district wide policy change, or just your school? If it was just your school, and you don‚Äôt find resolution with the principal, you could contact the school board.
Just go in your pants. When asked why say your right to a bathroom was taken from you.
Become Vincent Adultman with your trans or supportive friends who does business stuff at the school and demand to use the faculty bathrooms as a teacher business person.

On a serious level I‚Äôm really sorry. That fucking sucks. I wish I had an actual answer but I hope I could at least make you laugh a bit
Become a teacher I guess
Lol yup they did the same thing so I screamed at the counselor to let me use the women‚Äôs restroom
Damn that sucks :(. My school has been begging for another for three years, can‚Äôt imagine it closing
Just start pissing on the teachers, that‚Äôd change real fast! /s

That sucks that that happened:/ I wish people would stop being snowflakes and let people live!
You use the bathroom on the teachers :)
Go talk to the school open a dialogue that there is a problem
Depending on where you are and how accepting teachers/the school is, you might be able to talk to someone so that you‚Äôre allowed to use them but idk
me galm rock freddy shookted
Protest. School wide protest.
Yeah I don‚Äôt know what happened. Maybe some pushback from bigoted parents or something but I‚Äôm still shocked
I think it‚Äôs worth whatever consequences they try to dish out for using my bathroom 

Everyday I use the bathroom and get suspended ten days just means I can do all my shiz at home until I get expelled and take them to court or move schools 

Basic bitches
Red town, very blue state. This has happened before on smaller levels, students would complain or remove the signs, but now they‚Äôve done it to all the gender neutral bathrooms and locked them like other staff bathrooms
Yaaas haha
For real, if it were to happen in my school I'd be up at 5AM with a couple of queer students and we'd put giant signs on every bathroom door that'd state they're now all gender neutral, put some Xs in black tape on the gender icons. No destruction of property, no one gets sued, create administrative hysteria.
This is the best answer.  Picking locks is not.  A group picketing and protesting peacefully to get the point across.
This should be at the top!
That only works if they arent enby though :/

If they are non-binary, and dont feel they have a gender then there isnt one to pick that matches their gender. Their sex, yes, but as far as Ive read their gender neutral restroom theu had been usi g has been taken away.
Op said in another comment they‚Äôre locked.

And I just wanna like, advise against using the best possible bathroom identity-wise if you‚Äôre even somewhat worried how people will react. Getting beat up or worse, not really worth the risk
Yeah, explain to them how farming works in Minecraft. Technically then, this makes you a teacher!
Yeah. What the hell
I‚Äôm a trans women but I really don‚Äôt want to deal with all the annoyed parents, controversy, rumors, and other fun parts of using the ‚Äú‚Äùwrong‚Äù‚Äù bathroom
That might be it. People always vandalize them, flood them, graffiti them, intentionally clog the toilets. People really are awful
Did that today when I was talking with the vice principal about this. Teachers don‚Äôt like waiting for bathrooms and trans and non-binary students being able to use the bathroom isn‚Äôt as important, apparently
I dont think that went to well for the right. :P
Yeah people would use the gender neutral bathrooms to either fix their makeup or the guys would use it to ‚Äúsharpen their pencils‚Äù if you catch my drift. This was a hard enough thing to deal with while they were open
I would but they‚Äôre locked and I don‚Äôt want to get in trouble for picking them
They‚Äôre locked
Oh if I walked in the boys bathroom in a long dress the bottom of that dress would be soaked by the time I left. The boys bathrooms in my school are unusually nasty
Fair enough. I have to use it more often because medical reasons so I‚Äôm vaguely screwed
I don‚Äôt pass like at all because I‚Äôm seventeen and pre everything. I‚Äôm not among those kids who ruin bathrooms but I‚Äôm worried about any confrontations that might occur
That‚Äôs awful. I know how you feel, friend
What do you mean?
My parents are bigots who‚Äôd never agree to this (possible they were one of the ones complaining) and I can‚Äôt afford to pay a lawyer with my budget
They‚Äôre locked
I‚Äôm female, for the record. I just don‚Äôt want to cause a stir or parental outrage
There's no reason not to have them!  Ugh, I'm sorry you're going through that.
or people having sex in the gender neutral bathrooms
Seriously, this is *exactly* what I would do!

I would get expelled.
Has the school given a good reason, or simply no reason at all?
Illustrates a point that I always make that it doesn‚Äôt matter what state you‚Äôre in‚Ä¶ if you‚Äôre not in a large  blue urban area, you‚Äôre a target.
The fact that it is in a very blue state sounds interesting as sending something to the state government about this may have consequences for the school.
Learn how to pick locks, it‚Äôs really not that hard
What kind of lock? Some basic types can be opened easily with a coin, card or similar small things.
Thank you for pointing that out. You are correct.
Yeah, for me there's like, one gender neutral bathroom in each building at my school, and it's often taken. I haven't used a gendered bathroom in months, but I'll have to wait outside the door, or go back and try again. So annoying.
Then the closest.
I 100% agree. No one should ever make the decision that will put them at risk. I worry about my son's safety every single day so yes, this first.
Tell them, that if they don‚Äôt fit the needs, they‚Äô‚Äôre saying that non binary students don‚Äôt matter, and that they should actually start caring about their student‚Äôs needs.
I guess just pick a corner? Malicious compliance is tricky
Fuck
So skirt it is.   I vote for chaotic evil here.  If I was myself when I was your age it‚Äôs the choice I‚Äôd make.  We need the conversations to happen or nothing will ever be addressed.   

If you want the calm option then news media is the way to go.  This is your chance to stand up for yourself and the closeted trans brothers and sisters.   You got this!  Never let anyone define you other than you!

Ah fuck, I am sorry to hear that. Anyway, call an attorney. You may be able to sue the school district for discrimination. Not to get any money, really, but just to force them to provide proper facilities. What they are doing is discrimination.
I thought this was fairly nationwide but maybe not. There was a huge discourse in my high school cuz there was a non binary person that wanted to use a neutral bathroom, but the only ones we had were the teachers bathrooms. Most of the teachers were fine with it but the principal still made them get like a written form or something allowing them to. Idk who the form was getting approval from but the whole thing lasted a few months
ohhh that‚Äôs terrible
I know right. I didn‚Äôt think my principal was such a coward
Nope, just happened today
Especially cause most low grade locks can just be raked which is like a 0 skill attack. All you need is the tools and they‚Äôre cheap and on Amazon.
I‚Äôve picked school locks before but I‚Äôm not trying to get in too much trouble
Pull the power play, and use faculty facilities, and when youre questioned about it, say that due to the teachers taking away your restroom, you assumed that they meant they wanted to share theirs to be more accommodating to the enby crowd.
While that sounds great in theory, often times gendered bathrooms are right next to each other, so either you misgender yourself and cause yourself dysphoria, or you go in a bathroom that might make others in there uncomfortable, and if they say something about it, you can't even say you identify that way. That bathroom might also give you dysphoria. Even if gendered bathrooms weren't next to each other, it being the closest wouldn't get rid of dysphoria. Source, I'm NB and have to deal with this irl, hah
Thanks!!
Oh fair enough
Actually wait I was like seven or eight in 2013 that‚Äôs probably why I never heard of it
If you want to do something about that, picking locks is not difficult‚Ä¶just use the teachers bathroom
Can always do the good old ""it was open and I needed to go""
Heh. My school is actually okay about this, my restroom hasn't been taken away - actually, the only student available restroom in the main building used to be a faculty restroom, but one of my older NB friends who used to go there got some stuff changed, and now it's available to everyone ... ideally, at least. But yeah, I use a faculty one in the main building sometimes (though I do that a bit more inconspicuously) and a faculty one in a different building but I have permission for that, since there aren't any actual gender neutral bathrooms in that building.
I think they meant the closet, personally I choose the principals desk drawer :P
Ah probably
I‚Äôve heard you can do it with paper clips and bobby pins

Yeah idk why they make locks so easy to pick
Please teach me your ways
Don‚Äôt ask me. Lock picking lawyer has made me very sceptical about anything concerning physical security‚Ä¶
It's not like it's easy to make them hard to pick. It's more for scaring people off.
It‚Äôs just surprisingly difficult to make something that is supposed to be opened with a key hard to pick
LPL isn‚Äôt even human, lmao. I pick locks pretty handily, but still I spend minutes where he spends seconds. Absolute world class picker.
I literally asked a friend for a second bobby pin to pick locks and they AGREED
As a certified locksmith, locks can be difficult to pick. Emphasis on can

My University has menstrual products in the mens bathroom		"I have to admit I absolutely love this for trans men (and special congrats considering its Kansas) but part of me just doesn't trust cis men enough to not think they'll grab them all and walk around with a pad stuck to their forehead or something equally stupid.  


Sorry, as a trans woman I spent too much time among them. I have trust issues. :P
So glad to see this! Just got accepted to KU and I've been feeling really nervous about college in general. This definitely solidifies KU's spot at the top of my list as far.as places I've been accepted to so far.
None of the female restrooms anywhere in my city have menstrual products

Oh man I went to KU! Lawrence is such a special little oasis in the Midwest, and I miss the queer community there so much. I don't think they had these when I was there, but I was pre-transition through most of my college experience. Honestly wouldn't have left if it didn't get so damn hot(and legal weed would have helped too lol)! Always love finding more reasons to be proud to have been a Jayhawk ü•∞
We need this in every bathroom
Most bathrooms in lawrence dont even have these lmao its really nice to see KU have them tho
Well women aren't the only ones who need them. Trans guys can need them too
Yup. This is a good thing ‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

You‚Äôre not wrong.
The sad thing is i know many cis men who would do this. Not because they are transphobic or are trying to purposefully denying this from trans men and whoever else needs them but only because they are an actual idiot with single digit iq
Roflmao
Tbf when I was in secondary school (all girls school) they tried this but the girls all just messed around with the tampons (tying them to other kids bags etc) so they had to stop it and you had to go ask the receptionist or nurse for a pad/tampon instead

There's just some things Trans women will never get to try that cis women go through. I just wanna try the same things, I never grew up learning makeup and other girl stuff. Heck, I can't even become pregnant. Sometimes I just don't feel valid because I'm not like everyone else. Idk, it's weird.

[Action Alert] Help us prevent trans-exclusionary bathroom laws in the UK!	"#Call to action

**Content Note: Discussion of Transphobia, Bathroom Bills, and mention of transphobic assaults and sexual assault.**

The current UK Conservative government, in their infinite wisdom, has decided to turn their attentions towards a nagging desire to inspect the genitals of those using public toilets. Now, you might well wonder why the government is concerned with toilets right now, given the COVID death toll in this country just passed 100,000, but that is the situation as we see it right now.

See the full call for evidence here - [Toilet provision for men and women: call for evidence](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/toilet-provision-for-men-and-women-call-for-evidence)

Now, obviously, these sorts of laws are based on the misconception that cis men will claim to be trans women in order to assault cis women in public toilets. This basically never happens. However, what they do is give transphobes a pretext to police transgender people's use of public toilets.

This puts Trans Women at huge risk; there is both anecdotal and criminal evidence, that many trans and gender-nonconforming people have been sexually assaulted ‚Äî and thousands more harassed and insulted ‚Äî by people who find out that they‚Äôre trans. Sometimes, that harassment happens in restrooms. Without an anti-discrimination law, trans people live with the constant threat of being ejected from public restrooms ‚Äî or worse.

The implications for trans men are huge as well. Instead of making cis women comfortable and safe, these laws put trans men at risk of reprisals from people angry about ""the pervert in the women's toilets.""

**What we are seeing here is a cynical attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the UK in order to distract from a catastrophically bungled response to the pandemic.**

While the issue is now being used primarily against trans people, historically bathroom fears have been regularly deployed against civil rights causes. It was used against black people to justify segregation ‚Äî by invoking fears that black men would attack white women in bathrooms. And it was used to stop the Equal Rights Amendment in the United States, which tried to establish legal equality between men and women, because opponents claimed it would lead to the abolition of bathrooms for different genders, potentially putting women in danger.

The Mods wish to thank u/delta_baryon in r/MensLib who first highlighted [this Action Alert](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/lbni41/action_alert_help_us_prevent_transexclusionary/)."	"There's still no active way they can police it even if it is made law, which makes it doubly stupid.
But let's say it does happen and is actively policed somehow, I just hope the anti trans women who voted for it are excited to have transgender men using the ladies toilets.

You know, with body hair and beards...
Here's the Email Template for Mobile Users üíô

To whom it may concern,

I am a [e.g nonbinary person / trans person /
cis man / cis woman) and after reading the
recent technical consultation on ‚ÄòToilets for
men and women' I am utterly compelled to
contact you.

This consultation is a direct and violent
attack on transgender and Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) people's basic human
rights.

There is no evidence that cisgender people
face increased violence in gender-neutral
toilet facilities. However, we do have
evidence that almost half of trans people
(48%) don't feel comfortable using
public toilets, as a result of verbal abuse,
intimidation, and physical assault (LGBT in
Britain Trans Report, Stonewall UK, 2018).
The policing of gender in toilets is a wasteful
use of government funds, serving to draw
unwarranted attention to a political and
prejudicial debate' resulting from a wider
climate of transphobia in the UK.

As stated in the consultation: 'The Equality
Act provides that sex, age, disability,
and gender reassignment are protected
characteristics.' I would like to highlight
that the Equality Act of 2010 also serves to
protect those who are discriminated against because they are wrongly perceived to be
trans (including many Black women, butch
women and lesbians, GNC people, and
intersex people), many of whom face abuse
and discrimination due to a combination of
racism and gender policing, and therefore
rely on gender neutral toilets as a safer
alternative. 

Whilst this is not yet in the
Equality Act, GNC and nonbinary people
(including disabled nonbinary people) should
also be entitled to gender-neutral toilets, or to
their personal preference of gendered facility.
The consultation also states that ""Women
need safe spaces given their particular
health and sanitary needs (for example,
women who are menstruating, pregnant or
at menopause)"". This statement completely
excludes the experience of trans men,
intersex people and GNC people who
menstruate / are pregnant / at menopause.

The government's continued erasure of
already marginalized groups of people serves
to reiterate the inequality in distribution
of public resources privileging cisgender
people.

As a [eg. nonbinary person] I have never,
ever felt unsafe or at risk from being in
gender-neutral toilet spaces.

[Please feel free to add personal experience here]

The consultation states that you want to
ensure that everyone is fairly served. I urge
you to take seriously the negative effects
that the removal of gender-neutral toilets will
have on the following groups - Black women,
lesbian / butch women, trans and nonbinary
people, GNC people, and disabled trans
people - all of whom experience adverse
levels of violence due to the effects of
gender policing, and the compounded effect
of racism, which threatens many women of
colour due to racist ideas of femininity.

So I urge you not to remove gender neutral
toilets. These spaces are not only safe
but absolutely vital in the protection of so
many people's basic human rights. These
spaces simply must not be taken away from
marginalised groups of people who already
face disproportionate levels of violence and
abuse.

It is apparent that through this consultation
the government has aligned itself with
groups who intend to curb the rights
of transgender people in the UK. It is
dog whistle politics, focusing on the scapegoating of marginalized people rather
than the issue at hand; increasing access
to public toilet facilities. 

Gender neutral toilets are beneficial for a range of people and situations - for example, parents with children of a different gender; those who
care for people of a different gender; some
disabled people who have a personal
assistant of a different gender, and both
cisgender and transgender people who
experience gender presentation scrutiny in
public spaces.

The government claims that the intention
for this consultation is to provide ‚Äòdignity
and respect for all. I demand that they truly
provide this dignity and respect by listening
to the voices and needs of trans people and
their allies.

There is an architectural group called _Stalled!_ dedicated to setting a new standard for bathrooms which is more inclusive, more useful, more accessible, and gender neutral.  And their [signs](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad60216da02bcd61379bf06/1569594525017-WITD8KVQZWBF6INYMLKO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBL7y0DpH_e0bbX7enFn0u57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UT4ke-2faLbDJ2EQYXZquaaYAmln24LeHvojPJ-RAjfURBpFeAJxHLqEa5Otf4mhGw/Final+Exterior.jpg?format=1500w) are just objectively superior.

Here are two prototypes:

- https://www.stalled.online/gallaudet
- https://www.stalled.online/airport

They have successfully [amended the international plumbing code](https://www.archpaper.com/2019/03/international-plumbing-code-changes-facilitate-all-gender-restrooms/) to allow for gender neutral bathrooms which follow their principles.  If you‚Äôd like to learn more, listen to [this podcast.](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/where-do-we-go-from-here/)

I hope if we can share these proposals with enough people they will see just how much better bathrooms will be if we make them more accessible by every metric.
And I thought we were so liberal get your heid oot yer arse bojo
Yeah but that won't stop the tories one of the last good things they did was the upskirting ban about 3 years ago yes only 3 years ago look up the story that started it it's genuinely disgusting
THANK YOU you have just saved me like five hours
Yeah exactly homelessness is a serious problem especially in London some got temporary shelter to get them off the streets to protect them from covid

But still, there‚Äôs people who know. The ones who met me before coming out, my friends and the teachers. My classmates treat me well and even sometimes forget I‚Äôm trans lol, it‚Äôs cool.

So, like a month ago I began using the men‚Äôs restroom at my school. For a long time I was scared of doing it, but my boyfriend convinced me that nobody would care, and he insisted that I pass well enough to not get into trouble with possible transphobes. So I just started doing it, and yeah literally no one cared, or so I thought.

Today my year‚Äôs coordinator took me out of class to talk with me. He told me that the school managers and staff had noticed me entering the men‚Äôs restroom and wanted me to ‚Äúuse the correct bathroom.‚Äù Apparently they had also received complaints from some guys two years older than me about how I made them ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù being there.

They don‚Äôt want to make THEM uncomfortable so I was being told that I can‚Äôt use the men‚Äôs restroom anymore. WHAT THE FUCK.

The coordinator asked me if I was okay with this and of course I told him I‚Äôm not. He said he would try to reason with the school managers and the conversation ended with that. I felt like shit. I was pissed and sad and just felt terrible. My boyfriend was there to comfort me, but I still felt really bad.

Later when school was almost over he talked with me again and told me that I‚Äôm now only allowed to use the single gender neutral bathroom in school, which is the ones teachers use. I guess this is better then being sent to the women‚Äôs restroom, but it still feels shitty. My boyfriend by this time was already really pissed and went with one of my friends to talk with the coordinator. The only response they got was that this was a temporary solution until they figure out what to do about me.

I‚Äôm so sad and pissed and feel like shit. My friends are also angry. This is just so stupid, I literally am not doing anything to make people uncomfortable, wtf.

I am now at home and feeling really bad. I‚Äôm just not going to use the bathroom at school anymore. I hate this. It‚Äôs things like this that make me hate being trans."	"Y'all need to protest, talk to local LGBT organizations.
Where you at? Country/state? Depending on the local the admins could be within the law or they could be unknowingly breaking the law
Fuck em do it anyway. Hit them with the ""idk about your right wing bathroom politics I'm just taking a piss m8""
You want me to be your mom and call the school??? Seriously. Why arent your parents yelling the school down about this?
Are you in the U.S.? I‚Äôve always felt that banning someone based on gender is a federal violation. Gender discrimination, but who has the money to sue?
the discomfort of bigots is not  a legitimate reason  forthe case by  case application , as a proportionate means of  achieving a legitmate aim    by  exclusing someone with the Protected Characteristic of Gender Reassignment    
sounds like these silly boys have just outed themselves to  management  as  clear safeguarding risks
If its making people ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù  just go the extra mile. Next time someone says something look them in eye and start peeing on them. Never breaking eye contact and ask if they feel uncomfortable then.
Honestly, idk Mexican law (seeing from your earlier comment) but if you legally can, continue using the mens bathroom anyways. If you are doing something perfectly legal then they can't do anything per men at against it. (Also read the school's official policy as well, because if there is nothing in there about being trans & bathrooms and they do try and suspend you, then you can pull it up and rub it in their face to prove they are wrong, and (at least where I live, again check with Mexican law first) they can't change school policy mid-year without a public announcement to all students, parents, and staff, in which case you will have advance warning if they try and punish you.
Where are you from? If you're from the UK, by law you are allowed to use your preferred bathroom. It's worth looking up your local laws and rules on the matter. Good luck!
I can‚Äôt give legal advice and honestly am not well versed enough on trans bathroom cases in particular to confidently be able to give solid advice anyways but if you are in the U.S., I would think that G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board and the supreme court‚Äôs denial of cert (leaving the lower court decision in tact) pretty much clears up that the school can‚Äôt prohibit you from using the bathroom that correctly corresponds with your gender without violating title ix (unless the school is exempt from title ix) and unconstitutionally infringing on your rights under the equal protection clause of the 14th amendment. But again, I can‚Äôt give legal advice so I may be mistaken. I would strongly recommend however that if the school tries in anyway to further prohibit you from using the proper restroom that you seek out the services of an attorney or at least throw some of the above jargon at the school and threaten to seek out the services of an attorney. I would definitely make sure the school isn‚Äôt title ix exempt first before doing any of that shit though. Again, none of this should in anyway be construed as legal advice, I only recommend you seek out an attorney should issues persist.
Do you live in the United States?

Id still go in the crapper and tell that teacher to suck it. I had a similar issue a couple if years ago but now it doesn‚Äôt bother me. Im sure theres a way to escalate this to the school board or something
that sucks dude, at leaast people have your back, i hope the school sees reson, good luck
FUCKING BULLSHIT honestly you deserve to be treated with the same respect as anyone else. have they ever thought about how uncomfortable YOU would be having to use the other bathrooms? guess not. i'm so sorry, bro that sucks so much
WHO WANTS TO START A REVOLUTION!!!!
I live in Baja California, Mexico. I don‚Äôt really have a lot of knowledge when it comes to the law here, might be a good idea to check if they are breaking the law by doing this.
It‚Äôs actually not a federal protection yet. Many states have added to the discrimination laws to include gender identity and expression but at the federal level it is not a specific protection. That is exactly why so many people here are having trouble with crap like this.
They responded to another comment about how they live in Baja California Mexico
I do believe they mean stealth as in they look like a dude since their transmasc
Look at his profile you're just totally off in the weeds here very unhelpful attitude about it anyways though
They are a trans guy ftm not a girl

I‚Äôm talking about gender discrimination, rather than gender identity.
Lol I actually did watch that video.
Dang it!

Right. I was thinking there should be protections and recourse for that situation because of those laws.
It always perplexed me that cases weren‚Äôt argued on the basis of someone‚Äôs gender, in a black and white fashion."	txy7fq	trans	484	0.97	2022-04-06 22:35:35
I got denied from using a gender neutral bathroom bc I look like a guy:/	There‚Äôs a mall kinda near me and yah they have a gender neutral bathroom really close to like a security booth and you have to ask them to unlock it, I did yesterday but bc I look like a dude they lied to me and said it was ‚Äúfor nursing mothers only‚Äù my friend who‚Äôs a girl uses it and they never care + it‚Äôs literally labeled on the door as gender neutral, I‚Äôve used it before and I‚Äôve also been told I wasn‚Äôt allowed in before. Just depends on the security person ig if I‚Äôm allowed in. I just said ‚Äúokay‚Äù and left but yah, it was just kinda trash	"So does gender neutral just mean those who don't look like men? This doesn't make any sense
That doesn't sound like a gender neutral bathroom to me
Holy shit, I'm so sorry. Thats awful, and fuck them, and I hope it never happens again. We don't deserve to be gatekept from spaces put there for us, and I am so angry on your behalf. I don't even know what else to say besides that I am sorry, and you didn't deserve that :(
They won‚Äôt let you use a single person washroom‚Ä¶?
Yeah, it‚Äôs the same reason so many people accept non-binary people just as long as they‚Äôre skinny white afab and don‚Äôt medically transition.

I‚Äôll say it again y‚Äôall, man hating is a problem in the queer community. It‚Äôs why trans men aren‚Äôt seen as real men and amab non-binary folks aren‚Äôt as accepted.
I don't think they understand what the term ""gender neutral"" means.
Security can be arseholes like that.

I made a complaint. Solved it pretty quick.
For some reason non-binary folks are just ""women-lite"" to people. This why so many spaces that claim to be gender neutral don't allow male passing folks.
Why would they design that bathroom so that it needs to be unlocked from the outside?
so what's the purpose of a gender neutral bathroom if gender is a problem?
It‚Äôs a gender neutral bathroom but too many places try to call them ‚ÄúFamily Bathrooms‚Äù and say they are only for parents needing to accompany their small kids
People suck sometimes :(
that sucks :(
Does the mall have an ombudsman or someone you can go to with complaints? They should have a consistent policy that gets enforced consistently, and that's not what they have.
I woulda roasted and recorded they're ass
Talk to mall management.  They went as far as to have a gender neutral bathroom designated at the mall. So, it matters to them to some extent. Report the asshole.
Sounds like discrimination
That‚Äôs what people have always meant it as it seems, it‚Äôs a major issues for amab nb people, and on the flip side they don‚Äôt see afab nb people as nb, they see them as female-lite. Basically people only mean gender neutral until they realize what gender neutral means
Yes there are only two genders, male, and other. /s
Wow, a gender niche catering specifically to me! Once I'm done with my transition I'm going out there to get the passing test in da gender neutral bathroom
I can understand some of the arguments for gender dividing the multiple stall bathrooms, but the single person ones should be neutral. Why divide them?
Say it louder for the people in the back.

I've encountered so many people in the queer community whose vitriol towards men and masculinity has been weaponized to further disenfranchise and hurt people all across the spectrum of identity and orientation. From amab asexuals not being taken seriously to trans men being openly attacked, it feels like we're just collectively feeding into a lot of negative assumptions about men or masculinity that result in open discrimination like this.
Uh oh I‚Äôm skinny, white, AFAB, don‚Äôt plan on medically transitioning and I‚Äôm a trans guy!!
Junkies.
I know I fucking hate it so fucking much
Don't you know theres only trans women, nb means diet lady, and trans men don't exist
Good people and cis men!

I WENT TO MEN‚ÄôS BATHROOM	It smells bad, but I‚Äôm happy I could enter :)	"Yeah I've had the misfortune of cleaning bathrooms in my life. As AMAB I've always used and known the nastiness of the men's room. That said, there are PTSD-level instances of horror I've had to encounter in the women's bathroom that I never had to face in the men's
Smells like freedom to me
Me too I went in there yesterday during theater rehearsals it actually was clean and you could here me screaming and being happy (it was empty)
Enjoy the cleanliness of ""most"" men's rooms. On the whole, I find women's restrooms are on a whole 'nother level of nastiness
Smells like gender euphoria and piss
Yeah!! I‚Äôm so happy for you! I remember the first time I went to the women‚Äôs restroom. It was terrifying at first, but after I was able to get done and on my way, I felt so confident and exhilarating.
Congratulations. And yeah. Unfortunately it's gonna smell.
Congratulations, I know how much it can seem like a big step, hopefully you will keep using them
HELL YEAH
Lol this is exactly what I needed to jump start my morning.
haha as amab I'm very familiar with nasty men bathrooms. Some literally had nothing but a gutter on the floor üòÇ
Congrats king. The first few times are always exciting / anxiety inducing
hell ya bro
Congrats
Im happy your dream has came true
I always go but leave them looking

That‚Äôs awesome dude!
POGCHAMP
I wore nail polish to a bar today. Good job I can‚Äôt stand the mens bathroom. Ngl at work whenever a guy is using the mens bathroom When I have to go im like ugh yes I have an excuse to use the girl bathroom which smells wayyyyyy better like fruity and shit.
That‚Äôs the thing. Women‚Äôs bathrooms are _usually_ the cleaner of the two. So when it‚Äôs bad, something happened‚Ä¶
oh you do theater rehearsals? That's awesome I recently realized how much I love reading play scripts and I'm reading one right now hehe
I'm surprised more people didn't key in with the smell and piss words..
Except for the stupid pee splatters all over the seat that's somehow always there...
Yeah I‚Äôm costume head for my school play! (We‚Äôre doing brothers Grimm spectacularathon 1 act vers.) it‚Äôs really fun!
‚ÄúEw I don‚Äôt want to touch the public seat, that‚Äôs gross!‚Äù

_proceeds to blast piss everywhere but inside the bowl_ 

‚ÄúAh yes. Hygiene is very important to me.‚Äù
coooool :) previously I never knew how to express myself and I think theater might be perfect, I hope my newly found interest in it can help me go out more and find theater friends and stuff ‚ú®  
it definetly already worked for having a nice interaction with you haha :)
Surprise surprise, blasting piss everywhere is what makes it gross-
Also a fun thing is that you can dress up and have makeup on! Perfect for closeted trans-fems!
Pretty much reliving my trauma through this thread üòÖ
Honestly. Just put toilet paper on the seat like the rest of us.
yes you just described me HAHA. Also wanna know how I (at least in part) got the idea? I love mystery stories and looked through ""the three investigators"" CD covers and one of them was so dramatic like it was called ""the manuscript of satan"" with a satan hand reaching out of a piece of paper and I couldn't help but reenacting it and going ""the manuscript... of SATAN! MUHAHA (forms a claw with hand)"" and I always loved annoying my mum being dramatic and dorky like that so.. yes haha :)
Precisely. It's also what I do
Honestly all theater kids love annoying there parents lol
yea it's funny, my parents are such serious no-nonsense people and then I'm over there laughing hysterically over perry the platypus from phineas and ferb or stuff like that
Lol my parents are more chill but still kinda strict
mine are very strict so it was a bit of a clash and I wanted to make sure I don't become like them and keep my dorky creative spirit alive lmao"	xxtg73	trans	458	0.98	2022-10-07 08:17:59

Bathroom thoughts (mtf)	"Before I transitioned I thought it was disgusting how many men would just not wash their hands after using the bathroom. 

Now I know that being a monster has no gender. 

I mean come on people, it‚Äôs a pandemic out there. Wash your hands!"	"Women's bathroom have a potential to be far worse in my experience. Like the men's bathroom is consistently meh, the women's could be pristine, or someone sprayed an entire toilet with crap. I suspect some women don't just sit their whole ass on the toilet.
Lmao it‚Äôs wild in my experience I‚Äôve found women ALWAYS wash their hands ALWAYS
Weird conversations with my boss:
Boss: I used to never wash my hands after using the bathroom.  Then I became a parent, and gotta stay clean for kids.  Now I am obsessive about it, and you know what?  I stopped getting sick.
ME: Thats great, now how are we going to address the problems in this project roll out?
I don't know where the rumor that men's bathrooms are worse. I have used both and let me tell you, one has more disgusting stuff in the walls and floor..
The dudes restroom usually has pee everywhere and pee smell soaked into the stone. Women‚Äôs restroom makes me cry all the time because I‚Äôve ran into more blood than I would like to ever in my life.
Not the conversation I thought this was gonna be.
What's worse is the people who only wash their hands with water, no soap. Like wtf? 
That's worse than not washing them at all. 

Any bacteria will thrive on the damp environment AND you're touching surfaces with your filthy hands, spreading possible pathogens to everyone else who uses that facility. 

And then if there's a hand dryer, the unkilled microbes are just aerosolised into the atmosphere, with a lovely warm breeze to help them survive.

The average person, regardless of gender, is ignorant, uneducated and dirty imo.
Sigma grindset:don‚Äôt use public restrooms at all üòé

I would rather squat behind a Walmart with a fucking sock than use a public bathroom it‚Äôs always gross and one time I sat in a stall and heard a dude open up a hell portal through his asshole screaming and shouting for various deities to end his suffering and clearly none of them answered
Agreed. I don't really use public bathrooms, but I know that some people just don't wash their hands and pre- or post-pandemic, it's gross.
Honestly, I never use public bathrooms unless I am literally in pain because I hate how unclean people are. Plus I have already cleaned enough bathrooms to permanently hate it.
I call guys out all the time when they don't wash their hands it's pretty funny to embarrass then
me with ocd having to wash my hands at least 20 times: i agree
LMAOOO I'm crying I never thought about trans women having this realization (I'm cis and not super involved in the community, this post was suggested to me). But that's hilarious. It's true. Women can be absolutely nasty creatures too.
OKAY I WAS THINKING SIMILARLY EXCEPT REVERSE‚Äî (I‚Äôm ftm) Like WHY DO YALL JUST PISS EVERYWHERE?? IS THE TOILET NOT A BIG ENOUGH TARGET‚Äî
[deleted]
The amount of this I've taken a shit in the men's room (trans fem but scared of going in the women's during the day) and had someone walk in pee then leave so far has been 9. It's extremely award. I told my old manager that our only customer didn't wash their hands (it was close to closing) so she should wear gloves bc they still had to give her the payment. Was laughing my ass off when she told that he had the audacity to say ""Are your hands clean ?"" asking for a tooth pick. like bitch just came in closing time with a group didn't wash and yelled down our kitchen (open kitchen)
Yes iknow. I always wash hands, after toilet. But ikn What you mean. When i changed bathroom to male i saw alot mens didnt. And i Wonder why. Is just grosse and yes i cant Even discribe it
Is it not more hygenic to wash yo hands BEFORE using the loo? 

Then if you get some on your hands, wash again?
I was using hand sanitizer before it was cool...
Not even joking, when I started learning about women's bathrooms, I was like ""Maybe I can hold off on fully transitioning socially for a while longer?"" Lmao
I worked maintenance at a grocery store for a year or so, this is 100% accurate to what I saw. The men's room was a constant level of gross, the women's was generally good, but when it was bad, holy shit it was *BAD*
Guaranteed. Or full on squat on the seat.
It‚Äôs common for women to hover and not actually sit lol
I was a Janitor at a gym for awhile, consistently the men's room would take hours to clean all the feces and blood that contaminated the whole bathroom

The women's room would take like maybe 30 minutes
Ftm here. 
That's the first thing your mom teaches you: never touch the seat.
I‚Äôve worked in Evs for 11 years.  Two hospitals, one ranger station and houses.  Womens restrooms always were tough to clean.  Mens, not so much.
LMFAO that is so so true üòπü§£
Even if the toilet seat looks pristine, never sit on it. Always squat or hover.
As someone who cleans both, men's bathrooms are far worse. 100%.

Men spray shit on toilet all the time.
Worst experience in womens bathroom. Blood everywhere it looks like murder scene . Worst thing in guys bathroom extreme clogged toilet
‚ÄúIt‚Äôs crazy! Since this whole pandemic thing started, I haven‚Äôt gotten the cold or flu now that we wear masks and wash our hands‚Äù - Way too many people
‚Ä¶I feel like you may be part of the problem
You can also get it by touch, it stays in surfaces for hours. If you touch an infected surface, then don't wash but still do activities with your hands, you can spread it. It's not as effective to spread this way but it's still hella contagious!
Like a 100/10 on the gross shit-o-meter?
Hey fellow maintenance worker here. Yeah generally men are gross pigs and women tend to be more behaved. I think the times the women's room has been a disaster is because an elderly woman had an embarrassing moment and that's understandable even though that's our nightmare
Yes.
Obv never been to my old highschool... Boyfriend said there were no doors and people smeared shit on the walls to spell words out..
Worst in a guys bathroom it smells like shit all the time there‚Äôs always pee EVERYWHERE for no damn reason. Always found at least one clogged sink
Like an emphasis on the shit on shit-o-meter. I used to work the same kind of job, there are some women who REALLY need to get some fiber.
Yeah it seems like it was usually either an elderly and/or disabled person that had a tough time, or someone with a *real bad* cycle that was caught unaware. Tried not to get too upset because those things aren't really under our control and I'm sure *they* were not happy they had to experience it either.
Ugh.  My high school was like that.   No door or the stalls.  No toilet paper.  No soap.  No hot water.  No hope.
Fucking gross!  My first experience living with other men came when I joined the military, and we had to keep the bathroom pristine.  So when I left and went back to civilian life I kinda forgot that civilians don't generally respect the spaces they are in because they arn't going to have to clean the ever-loving shit out of everything they touch.
Every ladies room I have been in since I transitioned has, for some completely inexplicable reason, been splattered with pee everywhere. Like, even outside the stalls.

I thought I was leaving all that behind!
You know fibre makes your shits sloppier, right? Why would that help?

Also, I clean male and female bathrooms, and the men's so far have been worse when it comes to shit on the toilet seat.
I've had to clean up poo but never blood or vomit. We have this online training program called Axonify and I keep getting quizzed on a ""clean up kit"" for safely cleaning bodily fluids and then safely disposing of the biohazards. No such kit exists at my store but I have to answer quiz questions on the kit every other day
I think it's because when we squat, we don't have a steady stream of urine coming out due to he hood and etc it sort of just spirals/can spray and sprinkle out. It's a technique to it to not have it go everywhere, but regardless if it does people need to clean up after themselves. It's disgusting, I never sit on public toilets because there's always a urine on the toilet."	s45pny	trans	447	1.0	2022-01-14 23:23:15
Decided to try using the correctly gendered bathroom pre everything	It went so well there was like 3 people in there and nobody batted an eye I feel very pretty and passable rn	"Yay.

It is scary the first couple of times but if you walk in like you belong, most people don't look twice. They're just there to pee too
The first time is the worst....it gets better. \^\^ Congrats!!
It gets less scary the more you do it. I still try to avoid public bathrooms at all costs, tho.
pretty sure toilets have some sort of unspoken rule that you avoid eye contact and chit chat with strangers  - which probably makes this a lot easier :D
That's great. My first few times no-one was in there, so it was awkward once there was
Congrats!
That sounds terrifying tbh jkgwnelfrhen
And if you're in a situation that may be dangerous you can always ask a female friend to come in with you
Congrats! I envy you...
When the bars open up again, one of the friendliest places in the world can be the ladies room
Most decent people wouldn't bat an eyelid. It's those terfs who think everyone cares.
Way to go hun Like I always say. Be yourself because the people that matter don't even notice and the people that notice don't matter. Ya kind of still scared shitless my self to use the lady's room its more the area I live in then anything else thou.
Glad you made this big step and it will only get better.
My first time in the mens (im ftm) was pretty odd. This old dude glared at me but then also didn't wash his hands so... Also cis men grunt in the bathroom??? Why?
I'd only been out a few months, but made my heart soar at a cinema. I asked where the bathroom was, she instantly hit me with ""Laides room is under the stairs"". Definitely gets easier the more you do! I haven't set foot in a men's room in over a year. Can't imagine going in.
It really was but I had to pee and I think it would look weirder if I had walked into the men‚Äôs room because I apparently actually pass okay
Something one of my trans friends told me when I was getting ready to do this was that ""you might be surprised at how accepting most people are"". Like, in general, I do not encounter a lot of people telling me I can't do certain things. When people don't have a preconceived notion of you they usually just let you do your thing.
When I first came out, I absolutely thought people would be yelling, ""Gross! Why is that man wearing a dress!?"" Then I realized that 99.9999% of people don't give two shits what you wear, unless it somehow impacts their life in anyway. Most women also don't care if we use the ladies room too."	merb5b	trans	438	0.99	2021-03-28 01:12:24

Let's just be real. Gender has nothing to do with being a supporter or not. It's all about the mentality ‚ù§
That's so kind and sweet! :)
I feel the same way with cis women that support me tbh, it‚Äôs a fantastic feeling
I have like 3 guy friends at school (theyre not my besties but theyre still really nice and funny) and when they found out i was transmasc they immediately switched to using my pronouns and they even told me ""i always sorta suspected you were a guy, but i didnt know if i should say anything in case you werent"" and that was really validating
A lotta dude bros you'd think would be homophobes actually totally support it
same here bro i don't know why it is but cishet dudes have been the most accepting with me - save for one who had a crush on me and didn't want to be gay lol

ahh yay i'm super happy for you! cishet friends my age who are guys have been the complete opposite to me and i've had a horrible experience with them haha but i'm glad you haven't had that happen :)
The soux chef at a kitchen i worked at is such a dudebro and a great friend, and when his ex wife talked shit about me being trans he was like ""uh no stop right there. This dudes got one knocking his knees so shut the fuck up"". He did so much to include me as one of the bros during hangouts and stuff, correcting our transphobic head chef on my pronouns multiple times, and doing everything in his power to make sure that I knew he saw me as a man, even without testosterone in my veins, and I don't think he'll even know how much that meant to me. Dudebros can be the fuckin best

Yes
Constituchad?
I think what op is referring to tho is how men talk to each other in a different way than they would to women. Thus, these examples becomes both supportive and affirming.
they can be transphobes still...
Chadstitution!
Also, guys tend to be more aggressive in general. If they support someone they will do so aggressively.
Not saying they can't just most ""frat"" guys i've met have been totally cool with the idea n stuff. But my experience isn't everyone's

Oops my bad üòÅ	"So I was just grocery shopping in boy mode and I was there for a while because I hadn't really been to that store before so I had to look for everything.  
While I was shopping an unusual amount of people were looking at me and specifically looking me in the eyes and I was like uhm wtf.  
It didn't bother me or anything it was just unusual and nobody displayed any overt negative behavior or anything so it was fine.  
I just let it go and finished shopping...  
On the way home it was raining so when I got home I was fairly soaked so I went to the bathroom to grab a towel and dry off my hair when I caught a glimpse of myself in the mirror and let's say my lashes were a little more lush than would be usual for me in body mode lol ü§£  


Yesterday evening I've played around with mascara for the first time to see how it works and how it would look and stuff. üòÅ  
You probably see where this is going lol.  
I did take it off before going to bed but I wasn't doing it in a very well lit area and I guess it only looked like it was totally off in terrible lighting...in full on store fluorescents it was a different story.  
Oh well my bad ü§£  


I wonder how it would have felt if I had realized it while in the store because since I only found out when I was already home it was fine, hilarious even.  
Anyways just thought I'd share because it made me giggle.

Lol. I use to dress in what I called ""femboy"" mode before I started HRT and full-time Susan mode. What I discovered was that basically some people may look, but not one cared. It gave me the confidence to continue.

Never let them know your next move
Yesterday I did wings for the first time ( the cat eye thing), they were far from perfect, but OMG YES I got so much euphoria from that. I usually hate looking at myself in the mirror but I couldn't help put stare at myself for a few minutes, insane how feminine this made me look.

This is the tutorial I followed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=\_UeDxkWFe3E
Hahahaha, that‚Äôs how I ended up unexpectedly coming out at work! Played around with mascara and didn‚Äôt take it all the way off. Coworker noticed and was like, ‚ÄúYour lashes look unusually luscious today,‚Äù while we were standing in front of my entire team. I was about to lie and play it off like my girlfriend had done them or something and then was just like, ‚Äòyou know what, fuck it.‚Äô 

Everyone ended up being incredibly supportive and it was one of the best decisions of my life!
Yessss never let them know ur next move hahah
Full time Susan would make a great band name!
I‚Äôm full Susan today baby I‚Äôm feeling crazy
Lol where is this wonderland
Haha right?  
My lashes went from like invisible to PAPOW...I've seen woman with fake lashes you looked less glam lol very interesting experience
Nice it worked out so well for you.  
I'm glad it happened too because I wasn't planning to go out like that anytime soon but now I'm gonna pull the trigger as soon as I get a little practice :D

Was just banned from using the women's and men's restroom at school	"Someone reported a ""concern"" over me using the girl's bathroom. I am nonbinary and I go by she/they. It was always fine for me using the bathroom when I wear skirts and act ultra feminine, but the one day i go to school with pants on its like my identity isnt valid anymore. I need advice on how to deal with this please. The principal said I am unable to use the mens or womens restroom and am now only able to use the trans bathroom at the nurses office. I am male in their system, i dont identify as male, I feel extremely uncomfortable in the mens restroom so I use the womens because thats where my identity lays at."	"Does anyone have legal expertise here? This seems like it shouldn't be allowed, but I know things can vary by state.

I'm so sorry you have to deal with this nightmare of a principal.
is this public school or private? what state?

also side note, I am disgusted by how they are treating you.  literally disgusted.  this is a total injustice. sending you power and fabulousness xoxo
I actually wouldn‚Äôt mind my own personal bathroom to be honest lol. But yeah I understand how you feel. Stay strong.
Maybe check this out: https://transgenderlegal.org/
If you're in the US you contact a lawyer, because the rules will vary by state.  I think it's patently unreasonable that you're not allowed to use either the women's or the men's restrooms.
Tell them to get fucked and just use the restroom you want. What are they going to do? Monitor your bathroom visits?
Okay, so you are legally allowed to use the bathroom that matches your gender identity ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G.\_v.\_Gloucester\_County\_School\_Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)). They can provide you with a separate transgender bathroom but that also is not legal since that is the definition of separate but equal (which has been ruled unconstitutional). If you contact the ACLU, they will likely take the case. Two trans men who go to high school in my former school district are suing the school corporation (with the help of the ACLU) for an almost identical situation.

&#x200B;

Edit: If you are outside the US, disregard this. I have little to no legal knowledge of trans rights outside the US

&#x200B;

Second Edit: What I said applies to public institutions - I am not sure of the law for private institutions.
Piss in the corridors  


(please don't)
Do you have some form of student representation? You can talk to your class rep or to female students to get their support for this. When you have a teacher you Trust you can talk to them. When you trust your parents you can ask them for help. Talk to other people at your school and explain the problem. It is much easyer to fight a school when you are not alone.

OP, look at this comment: https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/s3hfnr/was_just_banned_from_using_the_womens_and_mens/hslgk4i?utm_medium=android_app&utm_source=share&context=3
sue them
That is actually illegal and discriminatory you can stand up to that and if it doesn‚Äôt get better you can report them to the district
Thought the supreme court settled that this is grossly illegal atleast for public institutions
I believe this is illegal federally in the US. Check out the White House Transgender handbook. All schools got it, but most haven't even looked at it.

My district refused to change my name in applications like Canvas and stuff, as well as in attendance sheets, which could lead to me getting outed. Under Title IX, that was considered discrimination, because they only refused since I was trans. I believe Title IX will also apply in this case, regardless of the state.

OP, do a bit of research and bring it to your district's Title IX coordinator. They legally have to have one. If they discount your research, threaten to get a lawyer involved, and don't be afraid to follow through. You can also threaten to take it to the media, but if you live in a more conservative area, that might cause more damage. This is illegal, and it's discrimination.
It does not vary by state. The supreme court ruled on this in 2020 ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G.\_v.\_Gloucester\_County\_School\_Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)). This decision basically means that gender identity is protected under Title IX.
Sadly since they're already getting complaints they'd probably be punished if it went on.
This is a Supreme Court hearing, not a law. There is no law saying that trans people can use the bathrooms of their choice. In this case, they ruled title nine covered his right to use the males restroom, but that‚Äôs because he had his gender marker changed to male and they still did not let him use the men‚Äôs restroom, not because he identified as male and chose to use the men‚Äôs restroom. What I‚Äôm saying is suing the school is not a guaranteed win because of how many factors come into play with states laws and such.
**[G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G.G._v._Gloucester_County_School_Board)** 
 
 >G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board is a case dealing with transgender rights. The case involves a transgender Virginia student who presented as male while in high school, who had sued the local school board for being forced to use women's restrooms based on his assigned gender under their policy. While the Fourth Circuit had found in favor of the student based on Obama administration policy related to Title IX protections, the election of Donald Trump changed the underlying policy, forcing a pending hearing before the Supreme Court of the United States to be vacated and the case retried at the lower courts.

But also possibly humiliating because the nurses bathroom is likely very out of the way. It would be one thing if gender neutral bathrooms were everywhere at their school.
Nah, not true. Red states usually have laws against this. In Texas, for example, it‚Äôs illegal for someone to use the bathroom that doesn‚Äôt align with their birth certificate. Title Nine makes it possible exception to said law, but if taken to court it‚Äôll most likely go to the red side. In the end, to give good legal advice, we‚Äôd need to know their state, to see how they expand on title nine, and her city/school to see their title nine policy as well. Most will show this on the school districts website and even have the staff member in charge of title nine at their school to contact.
Thanks so much for your response! So many ridiculous things are allowed in so many states it's hard to keep track of which of our rights are actually protected.
Getting punished makes for good lawsuits and media attention.
Eh. I guess you have a point.
Title IX is the legal force that gives trans people the right to use the bathroom that aligns with their gender identity. This is confirmed here [https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity](https://www.ed.gov/news/press-releases/us-department-education-confirms-title-ix-protects-students-discrimination-based-sexual-orientation-and-gender-identity)
Why are you misgendering op?
[deleted]
So my understanding is that the state courts might go the red side but you can appeal your way up to a federal court which will ensure the protection of trans folk using the bathroom that aligns with their gender. Is this not the case?
This is a kid. Lawsuits and media probably aren't their priority, my guess is they probably just want to live their life with as little hassle from transphobic shitbirds as possible.
Good point!
That‚Äôs talking about Biden‚Äôs executive order. Executive orders are also not laws, they‚Äôre more so suggestions for the executive branch and does not apply to states.
I was talking about the guy in the Supreme Court case, not op.
OP (she/they) should not have to use a trans specific bathroom if they don't want too though.
This is a state issue. The states have all the same protections as the federal laws have. It‚Äôs not a matter of the national laws will protect you but not the states. Title nine doesn‚Äôt directly say trans people can use the restrooms they identify with, so it‚Äôs left up to the states to decide that. Most red states leave it to the gender marker. The federal government will not interfere (with exceptions of Supreme Court cases).
We all do.

But if situations like this happen the transphobe  needs to be dealt with. Going the legal/public route is actually  the safest and most kind to the transphobe.
Yeah, upon further reading of that article I agree with that (made the mistake of reading the title, posting and then reading the article lol). However, Title IX is a law and since trans folk are protected under Title IX, I still believe a lawsuit is a more than viable option.
Okay sorry for the missunderstanding
[deleted]
So all of that makes sense, except there was a supreme court case that specifically said title nine covers not only sex but gender identity and sexual orientation as well. For example, North Carolina was told by the federal government that the North Carolina's Public Facilities Privacy and Security Act was in violation of Title IX and they were not to implement it. ([https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender\_identity\_under\_Title\_IX#North\_Carolina's\_Public\_Facilities\_Privacy\_&\_Security\_Act\_(HB2)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gender_identity_under_Title_IX#North_Carolina's_Public_Facilities_Privacy_&_Security_Act_(HB2))). This was before the supreme court ruled on G.G. v. Gloucester County School Board which is what solidified protection for trans folk under title IX.
It really just depends on the situation, the gender marker, the state, and their bathroom laws. All I‚Äôm saying is itd be irresponsible to say it‚Äôs a sure win because of x laws, because it‚Äôs a fact no federal law in the United States gives trans people the right to use the restroom of their choice. Just sharing my experience with my school and the interpretation of title nine in red states (I‚Äôm from Texas).
Yo, uh pulling the whole ""It CoUlD bE wOrSe"" shtick is kinda a bad look. When you tell someone it could be worse all you're doing is telling them that they shouldn't feel bad because it could be worse. But like...duh we all know it could be worse. I could be a starving orphan in a war torn country. But how is the knowledge that one is not suffering from something supposed to help them with what they're actually suffering from? Saying ""it could be worse"" is just net-neutral at best and makes one feel pathetic because they don't have a """"""""real reason"""""""" to feel bad at worst. Like I get you're just trying to help so don't think I'm trying to shame you or w/e just yanno if you are here to help that aint the way to go about it yanno?
That's totally fair. Let me rephrase my original statement then to say, contact your state's ACLU and get their legal advice. I have reached out to a good friend of mine who is in law school at Washington University (focusing on lgbtq issues) and will see if she has any thoughts or comments on this since I am definitely not a legal expert or anything.
The Supreme Court rulings act as a precedence to law as well. It is the reason why many states who previously refused same sex marriage now have to accept them, because of the supreme court rulings.

The Supreme Court‚Äôs job is to interpret the Constitution and to protect the interests of the people by overruling any state or federal laws that violate Constitutional rights. And as a result, no one goes over them over risk of facing consequences for violating the rulings."	s3hfnr	trans	364	0.99	2022-01-14 02:59:00
Boyfriend (ftm) and I's (mtf) shared euphoria moment at dinner	"Went out last night for dinner with my boyfriend. Had some great steaks, but the best part was when it came time to pay. I was planning on paying, but then he pulled out his wallet and grabbed the ticket. Had his deadname on the debit card, so we sat it in the middle of the table so the server didn't know who the card belonged to. The server had called him ""Sir"" earlier in the night, so we didn't know who he would give the card and receipt to. Server comes back to the table and hands me the card and receipt. He and I's faces both lit up, because his gender and mine were both validated in such a random moment. Was a really nice moment of euphoria we shared since he is ftm and I'm mtf.

I've been on estrogen and spiro since April 2020, but he's only been on testosterone for almost 2 months now. I have lived fully out as female for a year now. No going to the mens bathroom (except for the time I went into the mens room with him to help him feel more comfortable), and no shopping in the mens section, and I rarely ever get misgendered. Him though, he's still early into his transition, only having been on t for a few months. It was such a great moment of getting to see a completely random person validate his gender. From the beginning of dinner to the end, the server not once thought otherwise. My boyfriend's excitement and euphoria was radiating the entire rest of the night."	"AGH this is so cute.

Its so gross isnt it? Haha.

Oh the things we do for euphoria.


Congrats though my dude! Big step!
That‚Äôs awesome, proud of you! The first time I used the men‚Äôs was actually on a church youth trip, all 3 of the guys on the trip either went in with me or stood outside for solidarity :)
I remember using the Women's bathroom the first time I was alone and it was terrifying. I'm glad it went well for you.
Sorry the men‚Äôs room are always so damned nasty‚Ä¶ but big step forward for you!
yayyyy
I still haven't had the courage to attempt the women's, I still very much look like a man so I'm terrified. Though I can't even begin to imagine the courage it would take in the reverse. I might get looks and yelled at. Maybe the cops called on me. It's less likely that I may be assaulted in the woman's than vice versa. So, for real, I am in awe *genuine slow clap 100% alone in my place*
Soooo awesome!  I was terrified my first time.  <3
Congrats!!
Hell yeah!!!
Feel free to beat off in the stalls.  We all do it.
Pee all over the floor? It‚Äôs a thing we do
You'll get there. It's just a matter of believing you are supposed to be there. It's like most men's spaces. You just go take the space you need.
That‚Äôs actually a quite common stereotype, it depends where you are, like gas stations are the worst but they are usually very clean
Its common based on experience haha.

Ive seen nice mens and terrible womens too lol
Eh, based on a lifetime of experience with men's bathrooms I can say they generally are pretty gross. Women's on the whole seem to be much better (though not universally).
As a janitor I can confirm, everyone is nasty. Men miss, so do women; men are slobs, and my god...please...each stall has a place for 'that' trash...it's not for the floor.

Don't even get me started on rec center showers. The great equalizer - always disgusting on both sides. Blegh
one of the biggest differences is you never have dirty shoeprints on the seat in men's rooms
Ugh the things people did with period products in my high school was disgusting. Like there'd be used tampons just laying in the middle of the bathroom floor. No, not the stall, the bathroom. And this happened more than once that I saw.
I haven't experienced that in the women's yet either. How does that happen?
Hell I have fun stories of having to clean up after someone stuck it to the wall...not fun. At all.
standing/squatting on the seat to avoid letting your skin touch the seat.

it might only have happened because i live in an area with a lot of people who immigrated from countries that more commonly use squat toilets. Can't be 100% sure.
That's gross. People are disgusting.

i'm sick of the arguments transphobes try to use	"There was a youtube video that was recommended to me where this (probably cishet) guy was running up to people and asking them ""what is a woman"", and many people in the video were replying with ""um idk"" (which is a valid response, if a total stranger on the street was running at me with a microphone I probably wouldn't want to answer any of their weird questions regardless of whether or not I knew the answer). All the comments were basically just transphobes jerking each other off (I couldn't bring myself to read more than a couple, but it's clear that this video was aimed at people who don't even want to *try* to understand trans issues).

&#x200B;

Like, he obviously just wants to ""prove"" that only cis people can be ""real women"", and even if he were given a valid answer that included trans people he just wouldn't accept it until he gets an answer he wants to hear.

Similarly, the other day there was this post on reddit (in one of the trans subs, don't remember which), where op asked what a woman was. I commented ""a person"", because I thought that was a good enough answer, then the guy goes on to say ""nO YoU nEeD ChRoMoSoMes"" and other BS like that. I thought he genuinely wanted an answer. Who the hell even does that? Making a post pretending to want to learn more then just turning down every good answer you get (not saying my answer was the best out there, but I know for sure women would rather be seen as a person than just a meat sack with chromosomes).

&#x200B;

**I'm tired of womanhood being reduced down to breasts and vaginas**, it's perverse and dehumanising. I'm not even a woman, but as someone who has lived as a woman for about 2 decades (give or take) it makes my blood boil. I've even seen accessories, jewelry, and even **Christmas ornaments** made in the shape of a vulva for the sake of ""feminism"". It's fucking vile. I don't understand why any sane woman would feel ""empowered"" wearing a pair of clitorises on her earlobes. I mean, isn't feminism supposed to be about women being worth **more** than just their body?

&#x200B;

I don't know what I would do if I had to deal with one of those lunatics if I were openly trans. Even if I knew what to say, even if I had the *perfect* comeback to every little argument they put together, they won't stop until I give up and go back to being the wonderful fuckable little girl they would want me to be. No transphobe truly cares about women's safety in public bathrooms, or fairness in sports, or whatever the Bible says, they just want to use every excuse they can hurt people they don't understand - people they don't even *try* to understand."	"This is why when someone asks, what is a woman, I just say ‚Äúme‚Äù.
To the point of wearing vulva's , like I can appreciate it in the sense that it's also about reproductive rights and giving people agency about how they want to express their sexuality and going up against shit like the existence of the clit being denied etc. And as a trans woman it doesn't inherrently make me feel excluded

But yeah it's creepy as fuck when terfs reduce women to wether someone can birth children or be sexualized. They'll even say shit like "" breasts that have never known a lovers embrace"" with a straight face.
I actually try to answer this question on my tumblr 
https://transitorri.tumblr.com/post/679641495597383680/its-a-box-with-nothing-in-it

Let me know how I did or if you have other topics you want me to try and tackle
It‚Äôs the Ben Shapiro tactic. It‚Äôs where you target people who are unprepared, ask them leading questions until they get flustered, and then declare yourself the winner. It is perfect for conservatives because it beats all the complexity out of politics and turns it into clich√©s, which is all their ideology is.

btw The best response I‚Äôve come up with to ‚Äúwhat is a woman‚Äù is ‚Äúa socially constructed category‚Äù
I get wearing accessories or using Christmas ornaments with vulvas, vagina, uteruses etc.  it‚Äôs because those body parts are kind of taboo to discuss because of misogyny.  Like, there are huge gaps in our medical knowledge about these organs just because they are ‚Äúgirl‚Äù organs and sexist doctors didn‚Äôt want to study them because they were ‚Äúindecent‚Äù

That said, I agree mostly with what you say.  These people claim ti be protecting women, but what they are doing is objectifying women in service of policing our genders.
I'm intersex so i identify as whatever gender i want when i want although i prefer more feminine with occasionally going out in non binary mode, i have difficulties passing as male anymore because of the hormones.. I don't understand how you can be transphobic without also being freedomphobic and more, These haters make no sense and i feel sorry for them.
I think I got recommended the same vid. Was it by a guy with a beard and brown hair?
[deleted]
And I'm tired of womanhood / manhood being things altogether
I don't see how ""a person"" is a valid answer to ""what is a woman."" To me it would sound like a smart ass remark considering... every other person is ALSO a person. Being a person is not what makes a woman a woman.
What about people like Bailey Jay?
She is a woman with a penis, so what?
For me, Bailey Jay is a woman and not a man.

It's so ridiculous because:
Without knowing the genital - if people see a transwoman with a feminine voice and a curvy, feminine body in the streets, they surely would think that the person is a woman right?
Feminism stands for equality between both genders.

It has absolutely nothing to do with femininity, despite the name implying that. You dont see any dick decorations for christmas, so that in itself is unequal and the opposite of what feminism is.

These transphobes are too similar to a Christian trying to communicate with an aethiest. Aethiests are the open minded, progressive, critically thinking ones and the Christian's are the close minded, ignorant ones keeping society from developing. 

Change Christian to transphobes and aethiest to transgender and the same can be said.

I know like terfs objectify women in so many degrading ways.
That was a really detailed post. I really loved how you set everything out so eloquently. I was wondering if you had such a response for people who go >!""gender is defined by the genitals you're born with""!<? I've never been able to counter that argument head on (they see intersex people as exceptions to the rule and therefore don't break it entirely).
This was excellent, thank you!
I really learned from this post. You articulated things better than I could have. 

An idea you might consider adding, and I doubt I could say it as well as you: The conservative folks who need to focus on gender assigned at birth conveniently ignore the babies born intersex or those with ambiguous genitalia. It's not a huge number, but it's not zero.
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>Israelis like to build. Arabs like to bomb crap and live in open sewage. This is not a difficult issue.

Yeah i think so!
It was a pretty short video too, like it was a trailer for something
>""There's nothing in the Bible that says you can't be lgbtq""

Leviticus 18:22 is pretty straightforward. 

Genesis 1:27 is pretty clear God only created two genders.

Deuteronomy 22:5 actually says crossdressing is abhorent.

1 Corinthians 6:18-20, Galatians 5:19-21, Ephesians 5:5-6, do I need to keep going?


1 Timothy 5:20 ""As for those who persist in sin, rebuke them in the presence of all, so that the rest may stand in fear""

So the Bible is actually very clear that being gay or cross dressing is a sin, and the Bible also tells us to not associate with those who would live in unrepentant sin.

It's possible to Love your neighbor and acknowledge the fact they're living in perpetual sin.
It might be a bit smart aleck-ey but it is an important thing to assert. These arguments about definitions of ‚Äúwhat makes a woman a woman‚Äù have a bad reductive tendency to leave out anything that isn‚Äôt strictly unique to women, including basic stuff like ‚Äúpersonhood‚Äù (and by extension the rights, privileges, and respect that personhood confers).
It's not productive though to sort Christians and Atheists as good and bad. There's some dick close-minded Atheists and there are open-minded Christians. I see your point but not a good comparison.
Not all Christians are bad yk. I loathe people who bring religion into arguments about PEOPLES RIGHTS in ANY way. They aren't related. End of story. Some people can be close minded atheists. Like you.

(Sorry for getting so heated I'm just done listening to this bullshit rhetoric.)
okay. if a woman gets a hysterectomy does that make her a man then?
Women don‚Äôt need wombs to be women

Trans women are women
It‚Äôs not a wrong answer
If they dismiss the reality of intersex people (who, by the way, make up a larger portion of the population than redheads do,) in favor of their mythical idea of a perfect binary, they‚Äôre beyond help, I‚Äôd say.
You can't reach everyone is going to be the first thing, if they're super committed to being stubborn and refusing to entertain new ideas then you're talking to a wall. If however, they're sincerer and open minded, the tact I've been toying with lately, is say there's a young man, he goes off to war, while there he's injured, his genitals are mutilated during an explosion, he comes home, gets reconstruction, but elements of his leg and genitals are completely gone. 

Is he not a man anymore? If he's not than what is he? If he is, then why is he still a man? He has no genitals any more? Is it because he used to be a man? So, he still gets to be a man? If that's the case then his genitals aren't the factor that made him a man, because those are gone. 

In a case like this, I want the goal to be on the other person setting the boundaries and trying to define that grey space, put them back on the defensive because often people with this mentality like to take the offensive posture, make sweeping ill defined statements, and make you keep answering their inane questions. Instead, if you can push it back on them by appearing open minded and asking them to nail down the grey space, you can point out all the fuzzy edges in their position instead of constantly being on the defensive. This puts you back in control of the discussion.

The LGBTQ community is fine with grey space, spectrum and scales, we believe they exist, you can be man, woman, both, neither, other, we're fine with this. Make the person who claims those ranges don't exist draw the line in the sand and then attack that line by blurring it at each step, until they acknowledge there's so much ambiguity it can't be easily defined.

At least, that's how I'd try to tackle it if I thought the person was worth the time.
I have mixed feelings about using intersex individuals as pawns in the debate for gender, it also focuses the discussion back to anatomy, which I think is a dead end, or at least outside of what I was trying to hit there. Maybe I should try address that in another post. One focused on biology and anatomy.

The point is really to get away from the anatomy arguement entirely because so little of ""gender"" is tied to parts that we hide with clothes.

People like to hide their transphobic argument in anatomy, but, you show cishet men pictures of vagina having, hairy, strong, bearded transmen (picking on that group, cishet, because they're the biggest offenders) and they aren't turned on.

Why not? If they believe people are nothing more than walking penises and vaginas, well, what's the matter? Not uncomfortable are you? Likewise, if people are nothing but their parts why do they have standards for dating at all, wouldn't one penis or vagina be just as good as the next?

The argument they cling to is flawed at the premise.
Good Ben Shapiro bot
Yeah we've definitely seen the same video. I looked through his channel out of curiosity after the trailer. He made a video about ""woke oreo cookies"". I think that about sums up how pointless his channel is üòÇ
Mate, the whole Bible argues that everyone sins, and it's exceptionally wild to throw stones using the Bible as a launching pad. 

Also, no disrespect to Christians at all when I say - why should anyone give a shit what your take on it is?
Galatians 3:28 - ""There is neither Jew nor Greek, slave nor free, male nor female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.""

&#x200B;

God created wheat and grapevines, but He does not condemn us for turning them into bread and wine. God has blessed us with the ability to change, create, and grow. If it is in His will for someone to grow into a gender different to one they were assigned at birth, who are we to deny His will?

&#x200B;

Also please don't take Bible verses out of context - just because certain verses *could* be used to argue against transgender people doesn't mean that's what it truly means. It's a sin to re-write the Bible to have meanings that fit your own prejudices.  
Revelations 22:18-19 ""**I warn everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book: if anyone adds to them, God will add to him the plagues described in this book, and if anyone takes away from the words of the book of this prophecy, God will take away his share in the tree of life and in the holy city, which are described in this book.""**

Deuteromy 4:2 ""**You shall not add to the word that I command you, nor take from it, that you may keep the commandments of the Lord your God that I command you.**""
Ive just yet to meet a good christian that isnt zealous

Have a kid yourself then
That is a really cool way of going about it. Thank you so much <3
Yes, this makes more sense. Thanks.
I saw that you mentioned Ben Shapiro. In case some of you don't know, Ben Shapiro is a grifter and a hack. If you find anything he's said compelling, you should keep in mind he also says things like this:

>If you believe that the Jewish state has a right to exist, then you must allow Israel to transfer the Palestinians and the Israeli-Arabs from Judea, Samaria, Gaza and Israel proper. It‚Äôs an ugly solution, but it is the only solution‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs time to stop being squeamish.

Doesn't mean there is NONE though.
you do realise more than two types of chromosomes exist right?  
also how the hell are you supposed to tell which chromosomes a person has? do you carry around a freaking microscope and a blood test so you can make sure every woman you find is a ""real"" one?

shove off mate
there are also people with xxy and xyy chromosomes, honestly if you do a quick google search you'll realise how ridiculous your chromosome ""argument"" is.  


Not to mention there have been **numerous** cases of people who were born women with xy chromosomes, and born men with xx chromosomes. again, fucking google it
?
No doubt about that, same can be said for aethiests.as far as I've seen theres no open minded Christian's in my area so I dont have any contact with the other kinds

Bathroom story	"A few years ago I was at a restaurant in New Orleans.  

I overheard a man talking about the bathroom bills that had just passed; he was in favor of them, and felt they would protect the children, or whatever.  He even thought the whole thing was funny, and was making the usual jokes about liberals, trans people, etc to the server when they brought him his beers.  

When then man was ready to leave, he signed his check and got up to use the restroom, only to find that it was out of service.  Without a thought, he moved towards the women's restroom, which was free.  The server stopped him --

""Sir, the men's restroom is closed.""

""I saw that, I'm just gonna use this one.""

""I'm sorry sir, that isn't allowed here.""

The man raised his voice, ""Are you kidding me?  I bought 8 beers from you, I gotta piss!""

""I'm sorry, but it's against the law, you'll have to go somewhere else.""

The man cussed at the server and stormed off.

The server came to apologize to my table for the disruption and ask if we needed anything.  On their way back to the kitchen, I watched the server go into the men's restroom, flick the lights on and off, then remove the ""closed"" sign from the door.  

When the server came back with my drink, I asked if the bathroom was actually out of order, and smiling, the server said, ""For him it was.""

Anyway, I've been thinking about that server as I see new bathroom bills being passed.  I'd never suggest it, but maybe it would be hilarious if men's restrooms in these places started getting shut down, by locks, out of order signs, potato chunks, etc.."	"This server deserves a medal of honor for being a TrueAlly(tm) !!!
*black and white chad* ""For him it was""
You better have given them a tip
OMG I love that! I‚Äôm not one to gloat, but it serves him right! I hope that server continues to do this to others like him
Y'no...I may just try that one day...
If i ever see this happen, I think I am giving that person my house! Wow what a beautiful story!
That is so wholesome. That server needs a huge tip!
That beautiful!

Yes and I'd leave a 150% tip on top of the 25% I always do.

I went to the men's restrooms for the first time	"I didn't even actually needed to go, but I felt courageous enough to finally try. 

I came out 2 years ago and soon after I started my transition I was denied access to the women's bathrooms because I didn't pass a woman anymore, but didn't pass enough to go to the men's bathrooms apparently...

So yeah, this isn't a big event but I felt like I needed to vent. 

What about you ? When was the first time to went to the \[place here gendered restrooms\] and how did it go?

And if you haven't then don't worry about it, take your time we're not here to rush !"	"Congrats friend! That‚Äôs HUGE! I have been out for a year and a half and passing for several but didn‚Äôt try to use the men‚Äôs restroom until about a month ago. It got to the point recently where it felt extremely dysphoric to use the women‚Äôs restroom and since I have been passing nearly 100% of the time, it felt wrong to keep using it. With support from my therapist I decided to try using the men‚Äôs restroom at work when no one was around and it felt SO EUPHORIC! I cannot wait to have my phallo done so that I can pee properly in the men‚Äôs room! Since that first time I have regularly been using the men‚Äôs room without fear or any issues! This has been a HUGE development for me and I am so euphoric using the men‚Äôs room now!
Yesterday, I was at a restaurant and I accidentally walked into the men's room. Once I saw the urinals and realized I just shrugged and went for it. No one else was in there, so that helped me feel secure, but it still felt good
Congrats dude! It's nerve tracking but freeing. At about 8mo into my transition, I was like, fuck it, I'm getting a packer and using the men's now. I was only passing maybe 60% of the time, but I knew if I was an 11yo girl, I wouldn't be comfortable seeing me in the same bathroom. The only backlash I got was a dumb comment from the old boomer 'aren't you in the wrong bathroom?' Which I warned the store manager might happen. I was direct, curt with my reply, and I didn't hear anything more, thankfully. A guy in the deli had noticed and was like, ""should I always use 'he' now?"" And I replied, yes, but it's not  just oh boohoo my feelings, it puts my life in danger of I'm outed. That made things click lol
I just came out, but I remember when I was ""still cis tho"" fixing my hair in the boy's room and a dude walked in then immediately walked out and double checked the door - because he saw me and thought he walked in the ladies'. euphoria! - I was the one missing the signs lol
I am almost three months on T and I still haven't even used the men's room it's especially frustrating at work I keep telling myself I'll go somewhere less busy that I don't go very often and use the men's room but I keep putting it off because I don't feel like I look masculine enough to pass
Most blokes toilets are disgusting!
I just started using the women's bathroom at one of my university's building at work. I work late and it's summer, so nobody notices. It was hard to start, but it feels right now. Too scared to do it in public though
I've gone to the men's restroom once or twice at the college I was at for a quarter. It went ok but I'm still scared of a lot of cismen and definitely don't pass so I still find it terrifying.

My experience with cis men before and after I realized I was trans has been....bad overall and I still regularly deal with misogyny bullshit so I'm trying to balance accepting the awareness of danger and actually letting myself be in men's spaces.
I went into the boys toilets in college one evening when it was quiet. It was kinda terrifying but it felt so right. I went a few times during class but for the most part used the disabled as I felt anxious when there were other boys there
Congrats!! I‚Äôm going on a shopping trip this weekend with my friend and I might try using the men‚Äôs room for the first time too. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôll be able to gather up enough courage to do so though. There‚Äôs a family restroom in the place where we‚Äôre going to so I might just use that one. I‚Äôm so glad for you!üíôüíô
It definitely depends on who I‚Äôm with, if I‚Äôm traveling at all, or where it is. I came out about a month or two ago to my family after I was out of the house, because they are....Not the most supportive, at least with my father.
I‚Äôve been out for a few years, and I‚Äôm getting access to a gender clinic and planning on starting T. (FtM!) 
But the first time I went into a men‚Äôs bathroom, I was with my father on a road trip to a family reunion, and I remember he scolded me for doing so, and got really angry that I entered the bathroom and used it. Even when changing my name, getting a binder and packer, and just being blessed with a very androgynous face and build that could be mistaken for masculine more than feminine, he still denies that I am a man, though that experience only made me more determined to continue feeling comfortable and expressing who I am. Who cares if I get yelled at? Its MY business.
Dude yay; 
 as for me, I just.. Mostly don't use public lavatories. :l
Nasty in there isn't it lol
Congrats!! That's awesome! I've never used the ladies room since I'm still pre HRT and definitely doesn't pass as a woman.
6 months on hrt at Whole Foods. It was right around the time I started wearing dresses/skirts outside the house. Very scary but not like I could use the men‚Äôs at that point. Only time I go into the men‚Äôs now is if there‚Äôs no baby changing table in the women‚Äôs.
Deff a big deal congrats! I came out last summer as trans female when i started a new job. I told myself not to back down. And luckily they are accepting here so they have no issues with me using the women's restroom. The one time our bathroom broke we had to go into the men's room and omgggggg was that gross and disturbing and i don't even know why. I am 39 this year so it shouldn't have been such a strong response, but there it is.
I once went to a hospital in a very religious Jewish city to get some tests done when I was like 14. I needed to use the bathroom but the women‚Äôs was under construction (I am ftm pre everything) so I waited for a while to see that no one was in the men‚Äôs one and went in. I have actually been asked whether or not I was mtf (not a very pleasant story that happened at a different bathroom) so considering I was wearing oversized clothes I kinda passed as a young boy I guess. So I‚Äôm having euphoria in the bathroom like ‚Äúyeah I finally did it‚Äù, open the door and come face to face with an ultra religious guy. My heart literally almost exploded (ironically enough I was at the hospital to check my heart because of severe chest pain but turns out I just had anxiety) and I just straight up walked over to the sinks like I had no idea what he was looking at. I could feel him staring as I left. I was losing my shit from fear and laughter at the same time lololol
i've been on HRT for 4 1/2 years now, i've been using women's restrooms for about 2 years, which is around the time i legally changed my name/gender.

I'll be honest though i still feel kinda weird about it sometimes and honestly i more or less try to avoid public bathrooms just bc im not sure how i feel about it in general. if i have to do it, i will. but i just avoid it because im terrified of someone freaking out over my presence.
congrats this is HUGE!!!! so happy for you.

&#x200B;

i'm BARELY out so this is a source of much anxiety right now but i think ill just use mens rooms until i eventually can pass (im MtF)
Oh yeah I feel you so much, I hit the point where the women's bathroom just feels 'wrong' to me. I had also waited for the bathroom to be empty before entering, didn't want to attract any attention...

You planning on getting a phalo ? Dang that's so cool man, wishing you the best you can have !
I'm never heard a story so bold in my life, dang you actually got metaphorical balls for doing that
Sorry I didn't include any context. I began transitioning after starting a grocery job.
I feel you on so many levels, don't worry about it though, it's just a matter of time !
Oh yeah I also try to use the disabled restrooms as much as I can (mostly when there are a lot of people around) but I'm scared one day someone will need to use it when I'm in it..
Oh god I have never related to a comment more than yours, I could have written this. My family isn't supporting either, my mom denies that I'm a man and has publicly announced that she will never see me as one. The more she denies it, the more I want to affirm my gender (getting on T, for one and change my gender marker). 

You are absolutely right, it is YOUR business !
Ahah well actually nah it was as clean as the women's, I went to the public bathrooms in a pretty well known mall. Those places are really well cleaned in my country, even more since the pandemic hit
Thank you so much ! I hope one day you'll be able to use the ladies room, I'm rooting for you !
Hi. Can i dare ask how old you are? I am also pre HRT (age 24) and will start on Spiro this or next week and Estrogen in about 1-2 months. 

I am glad I finally dared to come out of the closet but very angry on myself I did not do it earlier, when I started to understand I was trans 12 years ago and could perhaps get better result.
I kinda just always use it now unless I‚Äôm feeling particularly confident and there‚Äôs nobody around haha
Sad part is, I think my father will finally see me as a man when I get bottom surgery, which will be a long ways away from here, so...Yeah.

So sorry about your mom too. That sucks so bad, and I hope she‚Äôll see you for who you really are, rather than her being stuck up in her own world because she can‚Äôt accept the fact that you are who you are.
At least it makes you stronger! üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Hey! I'm 25. Yeah I never really knew what trans was but ever since I was a child, I wished that I was born a girl (biologically). I've also thought it was impossible to go through with operations and I didn't even know about hormones. So earlier this year I read a bunch of info and realised that I want to transition.
Thankfully here in Sweden, where I live, it's all free but the waiting is longer. But hopefully by next year I'll finally  go on hormones :D
Thanks for the reply :) 

I know it takes time in Sweden to get the diagnosis and get HRT.

Change.org Petition: My school suspended a FTM trans person for using the correct bathroom.	"Hi, I'm Monroe. 

Recently, my high school has suspended a FTM trans student for using the correctly gendered bathroom.

If this is in the US you dont need a petition its already illegal, i think there is an organization that will help you sue them if you google it. If its outside the US then good luck to ya!
In tennessee if someone did this and another student got pissy about it the student could sue the school. Which sucks, but at least my school has 1 gender neutral bathroom.

Awkward bathroom situation.	"Some details (fTm trans, pre-op and no hormones yet)

My parents took me out for dinner(I was grateful) and I was wearing my binder and more male presenting clothes.

Then I had to go the bathroom.

It was a more country-style older restaurant, so they only had male and female restrooms.

I don‚Äôt fully seem male so I stood outside the restrooms for at least 15 minutes wondering what to do because there was no gender-neutral bathrooms available.

Am I a hypocrite for using the female restroom? 

I really wished there was a family restroom but apparently it‚Äôs not as common as I thought, Is it ok for me to feel awkward using either a male or female restroom?

Edit: My name Is Elliot, you can call me Eli!

Another Edit: When I actually left the female restroom, a female patron saw me and went to the other restroom (The men‚Äôs), she then checked the sign and gave me a strange look.

Gave me a little Gender Euphoria ngl."	"You're not a hypocrite. Of course, if I was there, I would fight anyone that would complain about your choice of bathroom. Let's see how indignant they can be with 210cm of grumpy trans lady in their grill!
my guy, no need to feel like a hypocrite. Its okay to feel awkward at this stage in your transition, I'm in the same boat.
noo def not. i am very shy/non-confrontational and early in transition i would go to whichever restroom i felt like i would attract the least attention. even nowadays public restrooms make me anxious even though nobody has ever actually said a mean thing to me about using the women's restroom, ever.

do what makes you comfortable and keeps you feeling safe.
I continued using the woman's restroom until my testosterone made me pass enough. The day I stopped using the woman's restroom was the day a woman looked so startled that I was in there, I had to pitch my voice high to pretend that I was just a very boyish looking gal to soothe her. Felt so damn bad.
I'm transmasc nonbinary, also pre-op and no hormones, and I typically just use the female bathroom if there isn't a neutral option (very rarely do I use the male bathroom, and it's usually extremely situational). I've gotten weird looks, I had someone try to tell me I was in the wrong bathroom once, but at the end of the day I feel safer being incorrectly in the female one than incorrectly in the male one. I don't think there's anything wrong with that.
Hell no.  I use the men's restroom even when I go full femme because I don't want to make anyone else uncomfortable.  I am 100% clockable and the last thing I want is to get someone beating the shit out of me or startle someone.

Edit: So, thanks to a bunch of cis girls that have started hanging out with me now I am comfortable going in the women's restroom.  Especially at clubs and bars.  They started by just dragging me in there but now it just seems like the normal choice.
I think it's fine man. If you don't feel comfortable going to the bathroom that matches your identity at least partially for your own safety and there's no gender neutral options you gotta do what you feel most safe and comfortable doing.
Bro use the men's room. Just move to a stall and do your business most dudes are too busy trying to look anywhere other than at another dude in the bathroom (can't be gay!!! /s) to honestly notice shit and if you are even half way presenting masc I'm betting dollar to pasos you will be fine.

  For the record I am a 5'11 broad shoulder gal in Texas who has yet to be harassed in TEXAS of all places the 2 years I've been out. I honestly feel like my days are numbered at this point... ü§î

Edit: just wanted to add another tip for my trans bros. Dude in the stall = shit bomb gtfo. Chances are you will just end up clearing the restroom. ü§£
Goodness no definitely not a hypocrite. Especially with gender bathroom bullshit going on these days. Need to be safe
I can completely understand. I have been so scared starting to use the womens room.   I would stand up for you anytime.
At my work there isn‚Äôt a gender-neutral option and I don‚Äôt pass, so I always use the women‚Äôs bathroom. It‚Äôs not hypocritical to be safe in places where others could attack you for the wrong choice.
So I am a trans female (Mtf) and at work everyone calls me she and everything but I still use the men's room as I am scared some customer will think I am a pervet or some shit trying to like do shit to people for using the right restroom.
Im mtf 2 years hrt and i still have a huge freakout when i need to use the bathroom and i cant find a disable/neutral one
One time, I went to the bathroom at school while wearing a skirt and I was kicked out by a transphobe teacher üôÑ Literally cannot do anything without people being weird lol
Hey Eli, you're not a hypocrite, you can use whatever restroom you feel most comfortable in. I didn't use the correct restroom until.. probably a year into my hormonal transition? So don't worry about it.
It's really hard at the start with transition. 

I also once stood for minutes just a few days after coming out presenting feminine trying to figure which toilet to use. That struggle is real
I'm in your same position and I use the female bathroom more often then I would like as the only gender-neutral ones are usually for those with disabilities or baby change rooms. Using those ones when someone else could need it stresses me out.

I use the female because I don't feel safe in the males. I know I make the women in there uncomfortable but I don't have much of a choice until I start T
Just curious, I know how to pronounce Elliot, but what about Eli? Is is like Eli Manning or ‚ÄòEllie‚Äô like Elise?

Also, nope, not a hypocrite.
Usually my go to solution is to look for a disabled toilet, since you don't need to be visibly disabled to use one and nobody will question it. That way there's no need to pick a gendered one.

Though, if there isn't one I usually go female toilet too (I'm pre-everything FTM as well), I've tried the male toilets a few times and it's just hard to adapt to, and I'm scared of being called out for being there. At least in the females they can see I have feminine features and I have a bust that's kind of hard to hide even with a binder.

Best thing to do is just whatever you're most comfortable doing, even if it takes you a while to warm up to the idea.
Depending on where you are, especially in the states, it's just safer to do this if you aren't 100% passing imo so you're totally in the clear. I do it too, and haven't even tried going to the men's room ever yet myself cuz I'm super super paranoid about getting hurt out here in Texas
I (trans girl) also went to a men's restroom a few months ago and it felt a bit bad afterwards. But it's okay. You and only you decide which one you go to, and either choice is okay. It'll probably take a little more time to feel comfortable and/or safe enough to use your gender's restroom instead of your agab's one, and that's very understandable. Go at your own pace, you're valid regardless of what a stupid sign on a toilet door says.
unfortunately, some times using the womens restroom is just safer. it sucks and hurts sometimes, but i‚Äôd rather be safe
I do the same sometime
I was in your same boat at school. I was even willing to risk getting a bladder infection because I felt uncomfortable to use the bathrooms and I didn‚Äôt want to make others feel uncomfortable. 

I eventually was able to have a laminated pass to use the library bathrooms, no exceptions; by the Head Counsellor of my school, how neat is that! Made me very happy.
Thank you! I‚Äôm just not comfortable with using gendered bathrooms because I‚Äôm not fully male yet and not fully female‚Ä¶it‚Äôs very uncomfortable.
Be my mom pls
I literally am only confident online, my voice is still very high, so every time someone meets me they always think I‚Äôm mute until I have to speak.
üòî after that they always say my voice is ‚Äòcute‚Äô
I had the same once (I'm still pre everything)

This woman came in with her young daughter, she saw me, went and checked they were in the women's and literally death glared at me while hugging her daughter away from me.

I was just washing my hands.

I'm 5'6 and was anorexic at the time.

She had a solid two inches on me and looked a lot stronger.

Yet I scared her.

I still have to use the women's üòì
That must‚Äôve sucked, I hope that everything was better after that.
I worry more about that using the men's restroom than the women's.
E-Lie, essentially.

Thanks for asking!

Who is Eli Manning? Hope I don‚Äôt seem stupid, I don‚Äôt follow any news on famous people.
I totally understand. You're fully male to me, at least.
Same situation here, also a trans man.
Giant mom hug!
Damn, that sucks so bad. I am lucky that in a usual setting, I don't scare women. Mostly because they are usually taller than me by an inch or so. I am a scrawny 5'3 man. Used to bother me a lot until I realized I didn't need to be tall to pass. People just think I am a teenager. Which can be annoying at times. Lol.

I am rambling. Sorry that happened to you, friend.
Yeah, no harm done. I still prefer the family restrooms regardless because my stupid brain doesn't think I pass even if nobody blinks an eye when I make my way to the men's restroom.
üôÇ
Second! You're male. Rock the cloak of masculinity your way
I love family restrooms, it makes me so happy that my work has one and they gave me an all-access pass to use it.
My work has two, thank god. It is kinda awkward when my newer coworkers that don't know give me a weird look when I do go out of my way to use them. I just explain that I gotta mad shite and wanna be mindful of my bros in the urinals. Lmao.
Lmao, mine just think it‚Äôs because it‚Äôs cleaner
I'll fuckin drink a beer to that one, mate. Lmao.

Your cute. But why is your phone upside down

Thank you!
Thank you, Morgan!!!
Thank you! No time like the present!
Thank you! I use MTX as a label because I am nonbinary but it also acknowledges my transness. It's also way shorter than saying: transgender nonbinary demigirl
I love it.

I am going on HRT but MTF doesn‚Äôt apply to me as an non-binary person.  I think I‚Äôm going to use MTX, assuming it‚Äôs not copyrighted or anything
Thank you!
Thank you! It's easier and more comfy for me to press the button on my phone. I don't like holding it the other way, feels less secure

My brothers wedding day is going to be so uncomfortable for me.	"So I‚Äôm transgender mtf and I haven‚Äôt worn any mens clothes for over two years of any kind or gone a day without my makeup since I started wearing it three years ago because of how insecure I feel without them. My brother proposed to his girlfriend in May 2020 ( he did it while they went skydiving so as she was landing he got down on his knee) and I was super happy for them and still am. However a few months after he came to me and asked ‚ÄúDo you want to go to the wedding?‚Äù His question was surprising and I answered ‚Äú Of course I want to go to my little brothers wedding.‚Äù As of posting this, I am 25, he is 23, and the wedding is in 12 days. So after I said I wanted to go he asked me to tone down my transition, telling me that her family was not going to be very accepting of my identity at the wedding. I promised him that I wouldn‚Äôt wear a dress or skirt so just women‚Äôs pants and top for the wedding. But after he and my mother talked about it a bit more to me I agreed that for the day of the wedding I will pretend to be a guy again. No makeup, jewelry, nails, women‚Äôs clothes or shoes, or makeup. Even my bra has to go! I won‚Äôt be able to use the right bathroom dressed like that either. It‚Äôs going to be the most uncomfortable day of the last decade of my life. But with that deal came my mother‚Äôs unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards. I‚Äôm looking forward to seeing my brother get married but not looking forward to the day at all. Thankfully I‚Äôm not in any important roles for the wedding. Congratulations Ryan and Heather! I am very happy for you two but this is going to be very difficult for me. Thanks Reddit for letting me vent.

Edit: To all the people bashing on my family and saying I deserve better than this, I‚Äôm doing this to be nice to them. But when I get married they have to see me getting married to‚Ä¶ whoever I get married to, guy or girl, not sure yet, and I‚Äôll absolutely be wearing a beautiful wedding dress. So they have that to look forward to. Not saying any of you are being rude or mean or anything but adding in a detail I left out. Please don‚Äôt take it the wrong way."	">But with that deal came my mother‚Äôs unconditional support to my gender transition afterwards.

Yeah, that's not unconditional. She's literally setting up conditions for her support.

At first I thought 'yeah, I _kinda_ understand your brother asking to 'tone it down' if the inlaws are horrible and transphobic'. I might agree to the same for my brother. They want to remember the day without any scenes, probably. But then going further and having you pretend to be a guy again is just seriously uncool. He's your brother, he should stand up for you, defend you and let you be you.
So it sounds like he doesnt want his sister at the wedding he wants his brother. This is so rude, and it's always the trans person that has to change for everyone else, never the other way around. Like another commenter said, he owes you big time. Especially 3 years into the transition. Fucking disgusting. And so fucked for the rest of your family to make the decision for you.
I hope your brother seriously pays you back for that because its a huge fucking favor to ask. I hope the wedding is nice enough on its own to distract you from it even just a little bit!
Jesus, just don't go. I'm sorry, but you're just shooting yourself in the foot by going. You've been a woman for ~three years and your brothers girlfriends family is more important to your mother and him than you are. They don't support you, they don't accept you, and they only see you as a woman insofar as it is convenient to them. Just don't go.
So u have to disguise for a wedding‚Ä¶ I personally wouldn‚Äôt, but its ok is your family and you know them better‚Ä¶ if you feel unconfortable you can always leave early. But damn you are brave and sacrificed for your family‚Ä¶ be strong sister!! Whatever you choose to make we are here so u can talk later about it.
Fuck that
Don‚Äôt go.
Yeah I wouldn't do this for my brother, mainly because my brother loves me and wouldn't ask me to do this. My brother would ban my mother from the wedding for not supporting me, and he sure as hell wouldn't choose someone else's family over my happiness. Sounds like you're being manipulated and you'll have people showing you these pictures telling you how great you look as a man for the rest of your life
Don‚Äôt even go. Your brother is transphobic too as is your mother
I‚Äôm sorry but I will never understand wanting to be there for special moments of others when they are marrying into a more unaccepting family and don‚Äôt respect you enough to love the authentic version of you. There are people out there who will love all parts of you and those people may not be your family but their love will mean exponentially more because it‚Äôs pure and unconditional. Do not minimize yourself to cling onto people who see you as something to be shamed of
I wouldn't go.
No gorl, no wedding.
If they mistake you for AFAB.. have a dress and makeup kit on stand by. That way if they make an issue of it - you can promise them to you'll go change into something 'more appropriate'.
If it was my bother saying that I'd literally tell to go f**k himself & his girlfriend too.. how dare he If his girlfriends family or his girlfriend doesn't like who you are, that's far from your problem and its absolutely his fault for marrying into such a terrible family. I'd stay far away from them or tell him either they must deal with it or you won't be going. Imagine being told ""stop being yourself"" because that's basically what he's saying!! Sheesh heck no you shouldn't be okay with that! Have some self respect
I‚Äôm in the same situation but I‚Äôm ftm :( you‚Äôre so strong, and you shouldn‚Äôt have to do that and I‚Äôm so sorry they‚Äôre making you. Maybe you could sneak a bra on or a little makeup or something just to feel a slight sense of femininity. You‚Äôre amazing and I‚Äôm proud of you. We both got this <3
Don‚Äôt go.
They don‚Äôt want you there, they want the person you pretended to be.
I simply wouldn‚Äôt go! You have to be you, he‚Äôs being completely unreasonable with no consideration to yourself
Honestly it‚Äôs nobody‚Äôs business. I would suggest going out separately all dressed how you want to. They are putting themselves in a bad mood by purposely misgendering u to the guests. It‚Äôs like no one knows till something is said.
Your brother is being ridiculous, your mother is being cruel, and if your little bro's wife-to-be thinks your existence is less important than The Big Day then she's cruel too. Are they trying to protect you from the family-in-law? Or are they telling you to relive uncomfortable, possibly traumatic moments when you want to be celebrating your brother's love freely because they don't want to ""admit"" that there is a trans woman on their side?

The first option is understandable, but still offensive. The second option is bullying and forcing you back into the closet. My sister spent a not insignificant amount of time at her wedding correcting our family when they deadnamed/misgendered me: if your brother won't do the same, then he's failing the lowest possible bar of respecting your transition. It may be he truly does love you as his big sister, but that doesn't excuse what he's said. You are not required to dress like a man. If you feel comfortable in a pantsuit, that's lovely! But do not let them bully you into suppressing who you are.

Best of luck, sis. I hope you enjoy some of the celebration. <3
I wouldn‚Äôt go. I know my siblings‚Äô spouse‚Äôs families beyond the wedding days, including on Facebook, so it may come out eventually, or you may be doing this charade forever. Perhaps they are okay with a later date? 

Please be safe! I don‚Äôt know I could do this without serious mental stress and anxiety. I don‚Äôt know how I could ‚Äúshow up‚Äù. Maybe you could talk to a therapist or someone else?
Thats such a gross response from your brother and mother, you deserve to be who you are every single day. If they dont accept you for who you are then they dont even want the real you at the wedding. You are valid and deserve this girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't go. Really
Just don't go to the wedding. Its a big thing to miss out on, but I believe in peaceful patriotic protest. You should let him know that who you are should have no affect on them.
Hope it goes well. Good luck!
Why would you agree to this? Your mom is going to accept you afterwards by denying who you are on the wedding day?

I think some transphobic family in law you'll never meet again can deal with you existing as a small part of the wedding.
I am so sorry you have to deal with that situation but I hope you have as much fun as you can at the celebration ü•∞
Maybe there are a few things you can do to make yourself feel more comfortable without it being too obvious. For example:
-using clear coat to pain your nails 
-wearing the most comfy and glamours underwear 
-slightly tinted chapstick 
-maybe find unisex shoes with a slight heal 
-maybe keep some of your favorite makeup with you so you can apply a bit as soon as you're able to 
-this one is a bit silly but it made me happy during school when I was in the closet but draw the gender symbols in the bottom of your feet 

I hope you can lessen your discomfort. You are so strong, wish you the best
It's a big day for your brother and his fiance, sure.  They're going to make vows in front of both their families promising eternal love.

And as an entree to their vows they want you lie in front of everyone.  A lie that will only make it more difficult for you to be yourself in the future, to both sides of wedding party.  A lie that will be visible in every photo.  Are they asking anyone else to lie? What else are they lying about, other than having a brother not a sister?

It sounds like you've made the decision to accept your brother's request, and we should respect that. Hopefully you find some laughs and entertainment, and have a good time.

However, it's only one day plus a lot of photos. He should never have asked you ""do you want to go"", he should have said, ""I want you to come as 'deadname'"" because that's what he really asked - whatever his reasons.  They can cancel the wedding at any moment, guests are able to cancel at any moment as well.  I would be very upset if any member of my family defined my future relationship with them by whether or not I attended an event where I was expected to betray my principles.

Not exactly the same, however, next month I'm going to the wedding of one of my cousins (not the same as a brother, I know).  He said ""wear what you like, just don't upstage my bride."" I wouldn't have gone if he'd said anything less supportive.  I expect some of the older relatives to make nasty comments, but I'm their for him and his fiance, not the haters.

one benefit of the pandemic is that we all now have a good reason to get out of any unwanted commitments at short notice...

&#x200B;

edit: 4th July, labor day, thanksgiving, halloween, Christmas, what have you worn in the past when your brother has been there? what will you wear when you're together at the next ones? Wouldn't surprise me if your mum's very conditional support comes at the cost of future compromises at major family gatherings; having shown the lie once, you're mother will find it more difficult, not less, at the next event.  You need to be comfortable with whatever decision you make, and only you can have an idea of what the stakes are with your family, so best wishes, whatever you do.
Best of luck hon, hope you can enjoy yourself. I‚Äôll have to get fitted for a tux for my brothers wedding soon.
I admire your patience. If you can handle this, you go for it girl. If that was me it'd be me or them, I'd tell them go frick themselves.

The sheer disrespect of telling a trans person to switch their gender is DISGUSTING. All those years fighting to be who you truly are and people just tell you to return so some people don't have to feel uncomfortable because of their own bigoted views.

Your brother and mother are implying you would ruin the wedding if you went as yourself, but it's not true, it's your brother's girlfriend's family that would ruin it. I'm sorry you have to suffer because of severe injustice, reading it made me really sad.
Not to be mean to anyone, I'm just asking, but why would their family care ? If they don't like you, what about it ? I mean, I just think that's sad for you to be uncomfortable at your brother's wedding üòï hope your doing really great
My daughter is getting married in April and Me as her father am walking her down the aisle as my true self M2F. Im wearing a ladies pants suit and will have my hair up in a bun and my nails will be done as well as having my jewelry on. She is ok with it so I‚Äôm happy about that. It would be hard to go as a guy now since I e been on hormones for almost 5 months.
Stay strong gorgeous we all have to sacrifice for our family ...its just 1 day beautiful , know ur bro will love u for it and no matter what they love u
Yeah, don‚Äôt put up with that shit sis, you‚Äôre worth more than that
It has to be your decision. As long as you are comfortable with your decision and can live with it. Do what you need to do.
im sorry hun, this is not acceptance. no ultimatum comes from a place of love. 
it seems like your mom doesn‚Äôt accept you, rather tolerates your transition. ‚Äútoning down‚Äù your identity is saddening, especially when asked to do so by family
It is your decision, if you are happy, so am I, but if was me on this same situation, I will just refuse to go to this wedding.
That sucks that you have to do that. When I went to my cousin's wedding I wore a kilt with my dad, and mine was üè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåà which was amazing, and the thing with that is, even though I'm a trans male, and it looks like a skirt, I was still seen as my identity. If I had to wear... I don't know, a dress or skirt I would've cried before we were even at the wedding.

Also I hope that if/when you get married you have the most AMAZING wedding dress adorned with lace or satin or anything because YOU DESERVE IT!
It seems like the emotional equivalent of beating you up at their wedding... Instead of them being uncomfortable you have to endure excruciating pain.

I'm rooting for you not to go but I know the power a family pressure. If you're going to do this I hope at the very least you don't gaslight yourself, and find ways ti reduce thre harm and have a safety plan for during and afterwards.
 Ie... just a few ideas to get u started...Can a trusted friend go with you? Can you wear panties and a necklace that bring you affirming feels...to tune into when dysphoria gets bad? Can you have therapy or a shopping spree or whatever will help you process and heal right afterwards?!...
I hope it went ok. I mean, OK is relative I guess, but I hope you were able to get some enjoyment, and are feeling better and more free now that it is passed! <3
Yeah, I was gonna point that out as well; glad I scrolled first.

No one I ever supported because I *genuinely supported them* ever had to strike any behind-closed-doors deals with me to earn it.  Caring about them was enough motivation.

What's the next bargain she's gonna want to strike once this behavior has been established as one that works?
The ‚Äúunconditional part‚Äù is so on point. I would just talk to them, explain your side and then not go to the wedding
tbh i dont think they took this lightly, if the other family finds out it could be long-term hell... so jumping to such conclusions is dismissing allot of nuance...
There‚Äôs no way they‚Äôll mistake me that way. I look a bit more androgynous than male thankfully but it‚Äôs also my family who would be in my face about it. They never said anything before but it‚Äôs my brothers wedding this time. The only big event since I started transitioning.
What if their families meet again? Or the wives family sees her and recognizes her? It's gonna go down at some point anyway
If my brother ever got married to someone who has (family who has) a problem with my identity, that's a them problem, not a me problem.

Trans people are always the ones that need to change for the comfort of cis people.

Obviously OP can do whatever she wants, this is her decision, but we need to stop excusing this behavior from cis people.
Agreed.   Its super uncomfortable but trying not to make any waves at your brothers wedding is probably the right choice.    I wouldn‚Äôt stay long.   Just my two cents.
Forgive me for asking, but you made a post 27 days ago saying you had just come out to your sister and your youngest brother hated your transition, but above that you‚Äôve worn makeup everyday for 3 years and women‚Äôs clothes exclusively for over two years, and your younger brother getting married asked you a few months after he proposed (assuming late 2020/early 21) to tone down transition for his wedding; I‚Äôm just kinda wondering the dynamics of how you‚Äôd be close enough to your family to where you let them dictate what you wear to the wedding while your sister didn‚Äôt have a clue for several years what was going on.
yeah, but i also kinda get not wanting that meltdown to be at your wedding.

sucky situation with no real ""solution""
Sure. So brother I‚Äôve lived with all my life, mildly homophobic but does his best around me and same parents. My older sister is my half sister by about 8 years I think, same dad different mom. I never really talk to them much anymore because they both live back home on the east coast. I‚Äôm in Arizona but was born in SW New York. I was never close with my half brother or sister and wanted to change that so reached out to them and we started talking, my sister anyway. I can never get Jake to pickup his phone. And I‚Äôve wanted to tell them both for awhile anyway but since I never see them I kinda didn‚Äôt feel a pressing urge to tell them. And the wedding was a one time thing for their big day so that I don‚Äôt end up being the center of attention at their wedding, which given our families would have probably happened. All my brother asked of me was to wear pants, no skirts or dresses and I agreed. Then after talking with him about his fianc√©e‚Äôs family I offered to for one day only wear mens clothes for it. I was doing it as a favor/ wedding present for them. So yesterday he gave me some of his clothes to try on and they fit well so he knows what I‚Äôm wearing for the wedding.
Warn the family beforehand, establish that THEY are the ones that are NOT going to cause any problems, and just try to keep them as separated as possible. Any meltdown is on the fault of the family, not OP."	t2hfw1	trans	278	0.99	2022-02-27 06:01:00
I wish I wasn't trans	"People always tell me that being trans is ""so cool,"" but what exactly is so great about it?

My brother, who I desperately want to think of as the same brother I had a year ago, refuses to use my name and pronouns ""because he's known me as my deadname and she/her all my life.""

At school, I have to explain every time that my name is Kai, not my deadname. The most frustrating parts of this is that Kai is on my school ID, just in parenthesis after my deadname, and people still call me she, despite me looking masc/androgynous and having a masc name.

Every time I look in the mirror, I feel like I'm looking at a stranger. I can't shower unless it's in the dark. We were on vacation the last 2 weeks, and I only showered 3 times. I was outside walking around most of every day, but I couldn't bring myself to shower.

Cishet people don't understand how much it fucking hurts to live a lie. To feel like your body isn't yours. To be judged. To be harasssed. To be misgendered. To be deadnamed. 

Fortunately, I've never faced any real violence because of my identity. But plenty of kids at school have called attention to it, and every time I use a public bathroom I wait to be punched. I expect it to happen."	"This, being trans isn't cute or fun, it's fucking torture
*fucking all of this*
This ‚òùÔ∏è

My sister once told me ""It must be really nice not having menstrual cycles (cause I was on my period; just no blood) and I guess I was just crazy hormonal cause I snapped out ""Oh yeah I love hating my body""
I hate it too. But it is who I am, so I have to fucking live with it and make the best out of it
This. I fucking hate being trans. It‚Äôs not fun when you know there are plenty of people that want you dead.
I hate it too. I‚Äôm 2 years into hrt and have had almost no results. I‚Äôll never see the woman i so desperately wanted to be and that‚Äôs just too heartbreaking a loss to live with so that‚Äôs why I‚Äôm gonna just off myself. Just because someone comes out as trans and starts hrt and begins to transition does not mean you‚Äôll going to get your happy ending
same here, everyone thinks beimg trans is some funny trait which comes with fun but my whole experience is horrible torture, wish i was just born a cis girl fr
I've got to concur. I tell my wife all the time that this sucks, people suck, I wish I could just ""be normal"" -_- most of my discomfort come from the opposite gender and the judgemental looks/laughs I get. It helps I started at 200 lbs and have a fair bit of muscle still so most people are too intimidated to say anything. But I'll find myself changing my clothes and taking down my hair just to avoid the ridicule. Everyday it gets a little easier though when you accept yourself and you get those good feelings. If people could just myob then transitioning and experiencing gender euphoria in public wouldn't hurt us so much.
Throughout history people have picked on, bullied conquered anyone who they thought was different. They looked at themselves as the perfect ones. There are billions of people in the world THEY are ALL different. And some day people may wake up to the facts that if you do no harm to others you are a good human. Being trans isn‚Äôt a choice it is who you are, others reactions are the problem. You are a valid m deserving human being. Be honest and true to yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Any time someone talks about how people are Trans for attention, this is what I say. Because who would choose this? 

Who would choose the hatred, the threats, the insults?

Who would choose to look in the mirror and hate themselves for facial and body hair, or lack thereof? For things other people wouldn't even notice?

Who would choose the terrifying ordeal of finally coming to terms with your identity after your developmental years, and fearing that no amount of therapy or hormones will help you?

Who would choose the potential of losing friends and family if you're brave enough to be yourself, but they're too cowardly to accept change?

No part of this is a fun experience. Absolutely fucking none of it. 

If your problem with trans people comes in when you see someone who's *finally* happy with themselves, and you sneer and scoff and think to yourself how they're just doing it for attention, or how you wish it wasn't a thing...

Who the **fuck** would choose to live on the opposite end of a world full of people like *you?*
Yep, pretty great like, being totally unable to talk to anyone about how I really feel, some of my friends saying I'm just trying to get attention, and thinking it'd be less painful to burn to death in a fire than have to keep going through this.

I wish I wasn't this way, either.
Hey Kai, this won't be like this forever, mate. Things get better as you get older and move on from school and all this dumb shit. You'll get T and you'll feel better and you'll pass and people won't sweat you about your deadname anymore. Life is so much more than it is today. I really hate being trans too, man, but you hang in there and keep your head up. Life will improve if you keep moving ahead.
being trans is not cool, it‚Äôs not fun, it‚Äôs just the way we are and we have to deal with society judging us.
I cried while reading this. I am so sorry that you have gone through so much. I‚Äôve experienced similar feelings and I‚Äôm a trans woman. It‚Äôs so hard and I understand the pain. 

Please remember that you are loved and valid always. üíñ
This is true. All of it. It's not fun, it's torture.

But some words of wisdom from one Captain Sisko
""That might be the most important thing to understand about Humans. It's the unknown that defines our existence. We are constantly searching, not just for answers to our questions, but for new questions.""

When I rewatch Emissary this quote makes me believe that humans are capable of empathy, and shows that we are always trying to better ourselves despite our tendencies to self destruct. Gives me hope
Being transgender is not a choice. I live my life the best way I can with what I have. I have chosen to transition and live my life as my most authentic self. Doing otherwise would personally be a lie. I can't live that way and still love myself. Do I wish that I wasn't transgender, sure. I am transgender so I deal with that aspect of my life and try to minimize any problems that come my way because of it.

You got this Kai. It should get easier the longer you transition. People treating a fine gentleman like you poorly for being transgender is unacceptable. I hope that you will be able to navigate these turbulent times well until things get better for you.
I think most of us wish we weren't trans. But that's not the hand we were dealt, v so you need to make the best of it. 

My goal is to feel normal, and I'm starting to really get there. It takes time though.
I get this a lot people are so ignorant abt things like this I‚Äôm sorry you have to deal with this king
It sure is hard and I agree with like 90% of the stuff said here but the thing that lets me say it's nice to be trans is mostly because of the amazing people i have met within the local queer community, the thing that i have something in common with those ppl. That we can relate to the same stuff and ofc Sometimes the same struggles . Yes it would probably be easier if we're all born in the body we wanted but i feel like i would miss the people in my life i like to surround myself with, Wich if i didn't had i probably would be dead by now cis or not.


Completely understand if u don't agree but wanted to share something different then ""same""
Yeah I've definitely been there. It's not an ideal thing and lots of people won't understand it. But it is something that will make you feel way better when you embrace all of yourself. I definitely cried for wanting to just be normal and not having to deal with it. But it really proves that we don't choose this for ourselves. It's just our truth. I can promise you that it doesn't go away, but it gets way better and you'll be much happier for having it be part of who you are then trying to hide it.
I know that feeling, my advice is just to ignore those horrid people and work towards HRT, once you do that you should be able to shower easier and maybe people will take you more seriously. They shouldn't need you to get hormones to take you seriously but there's not much else I can offer in the way of advice sadly. Personally I can't shower if I need to look down but I've got small a cups forming so my chest isn't so bad.

My mom is getting better and more understanding, but when I first came out, she asked if I was doing it for attention and to be different. Because I would *choose* to be discriminated against. Like every other kid, I just want to live my life in fear of being called a slur or wondering ""Will this person hurt me if I tell them I'm not a girl?""
That doesn't mean that there are no people who are doing this for attention. Yes, there are. However, I don't believe that anyone would actually *medically transition* just for attention. That would make no sense.
I felt like shit tbh. They're trans too (just not in the binary way) and generally they don't have any kind of dysphoria; more like gender just doesn't quite fit them, so they really do not understand what a miserable feeling it is
Not sure I like the what-aboutism here. 

Or the implications you're putting forward about the validity of those who decide that medical transition isn't a part of their journey.
I've thought a bit about your response and what I had written. My intention wasn't to invalidate anyone, yet I see that these beliefs can actually invalidate people and make them doubt more. I was thinking about people like that ""trans Korean guy"" whose name I've forgotten, but ... that's not being trans.

Thank you for your response. I see that I still need to change some of my beliefs, internalised transphobia perhaps. Might also be a reason why I find it so hard to accept myself. Have a nice day ‚ù§Ô∏è"	vdh9mg	trans	269	0.99	2022-06-16 08:38:19
A message to the TERF in my return line	"To the lady in my return line who said ""I don't come to Target because they let people use the bathroom they identify with"" and other rude comments about transgendered people, I would like to say thank you.

Because from how you said it, you clearly did not know you were talking to a trans woman. Thank you for letting my know that my transition has been going  so well that I hide right underneath your nose.






Seriously though fuck you."	"The funny thing about that is no one ""lets"" trans people use their chosen bathroom. Trans people just use whatever bathrooms they want to use and those who pass aren't noticed and those who don't might deal with uncomfortable situations. That lady is an idiot

Love that closing statement.
Those who don't pass are kinda in a super awkward place regardless of which bathroom they go in, which kinda sucks.
Finally, all these years of voice acting will pay off
Literally .. I avoid using public restrooms as much as I can for this reason

I never know which bathroom to go in if there is not a gender neutral one.. I‚Äôd say I look pretty androgynous? I don‚Äôt want to go into the womens cause dysphoria + maybe I look too manly for it but then maybe I look too girly for the mens.. sigh
i use disabled toilets where i can..

Why do some people think that trans women are pedophiles?	Some people I know think certain men transition just so they can go into womens bathrooms to SA women.	"Every conservative accusation is a confession.
Conservatives love to accuse minorities of being creeps to turn people away from realising that they‚Äôre the real creeps
Because the sad truth is that religious bigots are *exceptionally* good at brainwashing people.
Remember that when it comes to what conservative commentators and lawmakers are saying about us, every accusation is an admission of their own guilt.

https://m.dailykos.com/stories/2022/4/17/2092543/-Republican-Sexual-Predators-Abusers-and-Enablers-Pt-31
Because those people are projecting
It's left over rhetoric from the days when gay men were thought of as child abusers and perverts. The target changes but the rhetoric stays the same.
The same reason ppl were conparing being gay with being a pedophile not so long ago. Its easy and makes ppl afraid and hateful in seconds.
They're brainwashed conservatives who don't realise that some of the (very normal) women theyve met are actually trans because they think that trans women look like men in dresses.
Everyone can be sexually assaulted,people just hate trans women for no reason so to hurt them they say they‚Äôll sexually assault women if they have access to womens bathrooms
They did the same to gay men back in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. Media made a moral panic over gay men being teachers or adopting. Fear mongering over minorities to capture the majority vote is a political tactic. They don‚Äôt care if it results in the deaths of people who have done nothing wrong. They don‚Äôt care if it tears families apart or makes people homeless. They don‚Äôt care because they get money and power out of it.
Its due to the fear that anybody with access is an abuser. It's misdirected and should be directed at religious heads, teachers, coaches, and other people close to children. Infact most trans women don't even have access to children in the first place
 Fearmongering by conservative commentators/influencers and TERFs
The right loves to accuse people they don't like of wanting to hurt (white cishet) women and kids. They did the same thing with cis queer people and POC. It's socially acceptable to want to be violent towards pedophiles, so that accusation holds a lot of power. Not even getting into how pedophilia is a diagnosable illness that can be treated with antidepressants or therapy and threatening violence towards them makes them less likely to seek help until it's too late.
Because THEY are pedophiles.  And they're projecting.  They hate us, so they cast around for 'what's the shittiest thing I do so I can blame it on them.'
Mys exwife dated a guy who said I must be a pedophile since I'm trans. Guess what he spent 6 years in prison for??
Projection.
It‚Äôs literally just conservative culture war bullshit.

Immigrants are criminals and rapists, Gay and trans people are pedophiles and sexual deviance. Anybody who wants affordable healthcare is a socialist trying to destroy the country. 

They never say anything bad about cops or the church or anything that‚Äôs in line with their worldview. We are just a new bogeyman that they‚Äôve created.
Guess they are projecting themselves onto others
I think it comes from the fetishization of trans people espacially by right wing people who then think being trans is about sex (as in intercourse) So they connect being trans with sex and thus they get these stupid ideas
Considering a lot of bigots like to sexualize children, I'd say projection is partly to blame.
Cause people sill think men should be Superior to woman.
Because there have been like three cases of abusers posing as trans for that exact reason.

Having been abused myself I recognize thst they are not below anything and don't care about how it affects others, even entire groups.

They don't represent us but transphobes . . . phobe comes Greek God Phobos the God of fear and fear isn't rational . . . so transphobes don't see us, they see their greatest fears.

And other rationalities are lost as well, even the ability to come to terms with the fact they do fear us at all, let alone for irrational reasons.

How many have seen the argument, ""im not a transphobe because phobe means not having knowledge and I know all about trans people.""?

Nothing about the argument is rational, indeed its changing the etymology into so,etching entirely new for ignorant reasons rather than intellectual evolution of the words.

I have seen definitions of other words altered as well to fit ignorant and hateful arguments but the word right now is 'phobe'.

Transphobe is slightly different but still the root cause of ""dislike and strong prejudice"" is undoubtedly based in fear.

And the main problem is people who take advantage of marginalized groups, and it very much can and does happen to any marginalized people, and indeed even just those who cant stand up for themselves at all, and we can.

When I say those who can't stand up for themselves I mean children and elderly mostly.
If an autistic child can't stand up for themselves that then falls into marginalized.

Or are children and elderly also marginalized?

Anyway there are people who abuse children and elderly in such a way that benefits them.
Parents poisoning their children for munchausen by proxy, abusing a kind, well behaved child or elderly person until they lash out and claim they, the abuser, are the victim which gives them positive attention and their victim becomes the villain, harming or killing the children or elderly to post about it online for likes??? 

People are sick.

Some caregivers do those things. Society doesn't claim all caregivers are villains.

Cis men are more likely to be abusers than anyone else and society doesn't clack they're all villains.

So why then? Why us?

The irrationality caused by fear. Of something ""new"". Of something that goes against the core beliefs nurtured by toxic cults-I-mean-religions.

We're seen as new. There are other reasons as well but I honestly view those reasons as just toxic people either within or without, trans, supporters, or conservative saboteurs posing as trans or supporters, and not representative of the trans community in part, as a whole, or on individual levels. Because we are. We are individuals.

All of humanity are individuals who might join groups either by choice or necessity, and not all groups have beliefs that partially or fully or even at all are represented the beliefs of the individual.

Sorry for the essay just sick of society viewing like three abusers as the entire trans community and ignoring the absolute mass of cis abusers who could be any of them and they won't care.

We're marginalized. They fear us. They aren't rational when it comes to us. We are an easy target and they are bullies who love to . . . punch down?
""Accuse the other side of that which you are guilty."" - Goebbels
With all the hoops they make us jump through before doctors will even *consider* letting us transition it amazes me that people still hold this belief
It‚Äôs a classic step of fascism. It‚Äôs meant to increase distrust of the ‚Äúother‚Äù by heightening sexual anxieties. They used to do the same thing to the black community and, terrifyingly, was used as the justification for most lynches. People can do horrific things when they think they‚Äôre protecting their family, even if there was never any danger to begin with.
Conservatives, religious and right wing people do it because they love accusing minorities of being creeps to hide the fact that they may be the real creeps. They probably might have done/thinking about going the things they accuse them of.
It's usually what right-wing extremists think that because they'll lie and read misinformation or anything that supports their hate.
The first objective in hiding and covering up who you are is to project everything onto people who are different and vilify them.
They actually don't, they know it's a lie, it's just easy fearmongering to vilify us to gullible bystanders.
Projection
conservatives don‚Äôt actually believe that trans women are pedophiles, but because their anti-trans bathroom bills failed to get the public reaction they sought, they shifted strategies to foster the anti-trans sentiment they want to stoke. conservative politics require an ‚Äúenemy,‚Äù and with more focus on issues such as police brutality (no more pushing ‚Äútough on crime‚Äù), and gay marriage (no more pushing ‚Äúdefend traditional marriage‚Äù), conservatives had to switch targets, so trans women are that target (‚Äúdefend children‚Äù)

accusing a group of harming women and children is the easiest way to get public opinion to turn against said group, and is a strategy used by conservatives such as Anita Bryant in the 1970s against gays and lesbians. Bryant led a campaign accusing gays and lesbians of ‚Äúrecruiting‚Äù children because gays and lesbians ‚Äúcan‚Äôt reproduce‚Äù 

so all we‚Äôre seeing now is conservatives recycling an old strategy in the hopes of being able to bolster support for anti-trans sentiment
Hell, if i would want to do that what would stop me? there's no security or sth, so why would i go through all the transition stuff to only MAYBE one time see a woman making a dumb pose? it's not that they are all running around naked....
Because of transphobic propaganda. Repeat a lie over and over on all mediatic platforms and many people will start believing it.

It's why hate speech must be stopped and why many among us are trying to stop it. It's why transphobes and other bigots use the 'free speech' fallacy over and over to persuade people to enable the hate speech that they weaponize against us.
Put simply, it‚Äôs fear-mongering
Because cis het white me, project pedophilia onto Trans women and the lgbtq community.
Because they got brainwashed by people who want us dead.
Because bigots always villinaize people they hate to justify their bigotry. Racists claim black people are criminals for the same reason.
Conservative people think all trans people are either pedos, groomers, or both. It‚Äôs because it‚Äôs what they want to do. No sane person hears about the struggles of being trans and all the shit we have to face and just think nah it‚Äôs just men trying to get into women‚Äôs spaces to assault them.
Because they know that cis men are actually the pedophiles. Nothing like a good redirection.
They aren‚Äôt. It‚Äôs just the conservatives, who like to project stuff onto random people they hate.
Because conservatives don‚Äôt win elections without targeting minorities. They don‚Äôt have actual policy. Right now Trans people (and queer people in general) are the minority to hate.
I think it‚Äôs used as punishment for leaving the ‚Äútribe‚Äù of men.
Because it's happened before, and those types of people like to generalize
It's recycled homophobia being reused on trans people now that we're the ones it's ""ok"" to hate. It had no basis in reality when it came to gay people, and it has none now too.
They're usually the same people who are afraid to sail off the side of the earth...
Specifically with the pedophile thing there's been an effort to associate trans people with the term ""groomer"" and the basis they'll use for this is that A) care for trans children exists and B) We're currently involved in a struggle for our identity to even be acknowledge in places of education.   
If you're familiar with conservative media, they're pretty good at taking a baseless claim and running with it. The fact that there is now help for trans children, or that we want children in schools to know we exist has been spun into a narrative that we are predating on kids somehow. 

Since many conservatives think that being transgender is something inherently sexual or weird (or even immoral) it's not difficult to imagine how vulnerable they are to these narratives. From there it can bleed into the mainstream, and unfortunately otherwise chill or nice people could regurgitate these ideas. 

&#x200B;

And it suggs :(
Projection
dye to a few extremely disgusting ""trans"" people who set us back with their actions + conservative panic
The thing is, the men that want to S.A. women will go into the bathroom anyways.
Because animals can only comprehend base impulses.  Feed, fight, flee, fuck.  They can‚Äôt imagine any other motivation because they‚Äôre beneath all sapient reason.
Recycled homophobic talking points
Because the easiest way to oppress a minority is to convince other people that that minority is evil and wrong. Same thing antisemetic people say about Jewish people.
Yeah, I absolutely hate that. People believing that nonsense is probably going to make it harder for my husband and I to adopt.
They don‚Äôt think that. They‚Äôre just ignorant and, even if they don‚Äôt realize it, transphobic.
It stems from gay men being accused of it in the 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs. Because some were pedophiles. And then people were like ‚Äúif you‚Äôre doing this one unspeakable and unholy thing (sleeping with other men), then you must be doing this other unspeakable and unholy thing as well (pedophilia)‚Äù. But then as gay people began to be more accepted and they realized they weren‚Äôt all a bunch of pedo‚Äôs the cis folk were like, ‚Äúthen where are all the pedophiles coming from?? CAN‚ÄôT be us.‚Äù
Theyre incapable of the empathy and understanding it takes to realize that their god is imperfect.
I actually came out to my kids recently and I only said this to my eldest because the others are too young to understand, but I felt that as part of the conversation I had to warn him that people would say awful things about me to him like that. There's not a lot that I'm willing to admit being scared of, but that accusation terrifies me. Even when you're proven innocent, people only remember the accusation.

They're saying it to create and reinforce the connection. They want monsters they can vilify with impunity.
Regardless, it would have been great if they agreed to a compromise; make very stupid American public bathroom stall floor-to-ceiling. I detest trying to pee with some woman‚Äôs kid staring at me from under the stall or through the wide cracks in the door. You‚Äôd think that would solve it. European bathrooms seem to allow for decency. I will never understand why American stalls are so peek-a-boo.
So they can scare people into letting them do to trans people whatever they want to. ""They're coming for your kids"" is a common tactic for othering people. You can nazis using the same tactic on groups they hate leading up to WW2.  Fascists can get people to do horrific things under the guise of ""think of the children"" cause scared people are emotional people, and emotional people don't think.
People who are uncomfortable with a other people for no good reason will try to come up with any excuse to justify their discomfort instead of recognizing it as simple fear or the other. Likewise people that are comfortable with a person or organization will make every excuse to dismiss the same behavior they vilify in their discomfort. 

It's why trans people are pedophiles, but actual pedophile Republicans and church leaders just ""made a mistake"".
its a control tactic! getting everyone to believe that trans women are pedophiles makes it easier to violently erase them. most people who believe that logic are having it fed to them by conservative news outlets, and some extremists have it fed to them by obscurely niche news outlets. whats ironic is that the politicians spreading that agenda are most likely pedophiles themselves.
Maybe that's something pedophiles think about doing?  Maybe they know that because they've thought about doing that. - perfect response! Lol
Fr, they're the ones that want to inspect the genitals of school children
Perfectly stated! I‚Äôm putting that on a t-shirt.
They are quick to accuse for fear of being accused. üíú
And projecting.
Like i don‚Äôt think sernario even exists and generallise this notion to all trans women is wrong
And they are often the pedophiles themselves!!!!
Personally, I think it‚Äôs because the religious bigots are projecting. This is the kind of thing they would do, and they cannot imagine us NOT doing it. It speaks more to the corruption of religious leaders than anything else.
Religion is a brainwashhed-friendly name for cult.
I think you over exagerate the extent to which it is religious.
Oh my god. I really don‚Äôt like us and them politics, but, when ‚Äúthem‚Äù keeps on attacking us unprovoked, accusing us of heinous things that really haven‚Äôt ever been found to be true in any statistical significance, well, this site is pretty nice to see
This is the real answer.  It's recycled rhetoric from the fight over gay rights.  I was really nervous about it until I saw Senator Scott Weiner address it so eloquently:

> I will add that I've been called pedophile tens of thousands of times. It's rare that a day goes by that somebody doesn't call me a pedophile on social media.""

We just have to let it roll off our back.  If we get defensive, they construe it as guilt.  Treat the accusation as ridiculous as it is.

Article: https://www.advocate.com/news/2022/9/26/state-senator-scott-wiener-goes-folsom-street-fair-gop-loses-it
I'm pretty sure that if a man wanted to SA women in women's bathroom, the man wouldn't undergo HRT and surgery, he would just enter the bathroom and do the act.
This, sure part of ‚Äúgroomer‚Äù discourse is about randomly accusing trans people of any heinous act but part of this grander Replacement Theory conspiracy theory bullshit that underlines their rhetoric is that the ‚Äúgay agenda‚Äù is to influence kids into ‚Äúturning‚Äù queer so they will abandon god and the gop.. which is like, fucking lol
True. They really did equate homosexuality with pedophila heavily back in the ‚Äò80s and ‚Äò90s. (Note I wrote this correctly; not 80‚Äôs and 90‚Äôs.üòÅ)
Just because it‚Äôs happens, doesn‚Äôt mean that EVERY trans person or woman is going to prey on women in bathrooms. Hell, they‚Äôre FULL ON men who would go into women restrooms to SA women yet the people who generalize trans people into being groomers or SA‚Äôers never talk about that!
Yeah people are just transphobic and conservative and when you‚Äôre conservative you want the bad times to be back for no reason most of the time
Agreed
I mean, there also was one that did that, but to himself in the preschool parking lot, but dont worry, theyll just keep saying it was us doing that all along.
Who?!?  What?!?  When?!? Where?!?  Why?!? But not how.
I can‚Äôt take credit. Idk the source sadly.
And then they actually do get gotted lol. There was some right sided guy iirc who did stuff in his car in a preschool parking lot, yet were the pedos.
This is one of the biggest parts of it. They think since they are attracted to kids then the ""pervert"" who wears a dress must also be attracted to kids and that's wrong
So much projection.
Yeah, propaganda is a hell of a drug, and when you're already programmed to not think about things, logic just has no power.

Think it was a politician, I learned about it off of a post like this like a few months ago, so idk where to get the accurate information on who exactly it was, but I did see it here, and its quite disgusting that those people who say we do that, do that...
Exactly how I see it. We get the labels of it, while they constantly get caught doing it. Like just because u are something doesn't mean u specifically and only are something else.

Someone could be a criminal, but it doesnt mean they assaulted someone, they could be in there for just any other reason.
Its all good haha
Yup, they're just looking for an easy target to project their own disgusting shit onto

School locker rooms	"My 13yo daughter is trans, in 7th grade. She's transitioned socially but due to cost, not medically. There's a trans girl in 9th grade in the same boat. They both came out last year but since only half the students were actually in class and they closed the locker rooms for social distancing reasons, no one did much more than grumble under their breath. This year, however, there are parent meetings going on about the trans kids in bathrooms and locker rooms. They're at the school board meetings demanding action.
A couple days ago I sat with 4 of the ""concerned mom's"" to try to educate them, or at least find out what their plans are. They said, ""We just want to make sure every child is comfortable in the locker room."" I called bullshit. I straight up said, ""No you don't. Kids have been uncomfortable in locker rooms forever. There are always kids who hate changing. And none of you gave a shit about ANY of them. Schools, parents, everyone, tells these kids all the time that they have no choice, they have to change, it's part of life, and their grade depends on it. The only reason you all care now is because you think they SHOULD be uncomfortable. That's where I take offense. You're perfectly fine forcing minor children to undress for grades, but not with my child existing in the room."" Well, they'd never thought of it that way before! These mom's, and a bunch of others who just didn't show up to lunch that day, told me they want to school to put partitions in the locker rooms so everyone will have privacy. Again, ""That won't work. It will give the kids privacy but the problem isn't the kids, it's you, and you have an issue with the bathroom and that already has separate stalls.""
Long story short, they agreed that an easier solution is to stop making kids undress for grades. It's a very small victory, but I count it as a win. And hopefully they'll be more open to talking about their next complaint. I hope so, because I have a whole big speech about how the first time a butterfly lands on a toddler they freak out but instead of trying to keep butterflies away from them forever, parents just explain that butterflies aren't dangerous, and maybe these parents could treat trans people the same way and explain that they're not a threat instead of indulging their kids' unrealistic fears."	"You speak the truth with eloquence and power. You're my new friend!
You rock! I'm saving this post for future reference.
Thank you!

Changing for gym in high school was absolutely terrifying.  I didn't know why at the time, but it just filled me with dread.  I used to wait until everyone else was done before I'd change.  This worked until they got a new gym teacher.  He screamed at me for ""wasting time"" when I desperately tried explaining how uncomfortable I was.  I started wearing my gym clothes under my regular clothes so I could change extremely quickly, and didn't have to expose my chest.

The gym teacher always put me on ""skins"" during basketball, which I absolutely refused to do.  I eventually quit changing all together after being pantsed.  The school administrators tried to blame me, and threatened me because the kid lied and said I spread a rumor about him.  That it was my fault.  They also asked embarrassing questions like ""Did *IT* fall out?"".  So, I quit changing after that.  I got a C in gym for not participating, and my dad screamed at me.  I was so happy that I never had to take gym again after that year.
This is fantastic. Thank you for speaking out. Your daughter is lucky to have you. 

I am curious though, and I apologize for not knowing more about tween/teen trans folks, but you say‚Äînot medically transitioned due to cost‚Äîdo you just mean hormone blockers? Can 13 year olds take HRT? I wish her and you the best of luck regardless.
I love this view of locker rooms (well,  I hate the truth of it, and as a trans person I hate locker rooms in general, but I love the fact that you put it so accurately)
Your a true legend
You are an amazing parent holy shit
Thats definitely a win.

I genuinely don't understand all this gender separation. Most swimming changing rooms I've been to are 1 big changing room with single stalls. 

Couple of gendered shower rooms and some bigger family stalls but that's it. So I get a choice where I go. Weirdly the gym changing rooms at the same place are gendered.

Why don't we just have single stalls everywhere?
Are they their kids‚Äô fears though? In my experience as a kid of very hateful people, any fears I had about gay or trans people (which I grew up to realize I AM on both counts) was given to me by my parents. I wouldn‚Äôt give these people an inch to shift blame to their kids, and I‚Äôd make sure to place and keep that blame for having fear of trans people squarely on their shoulders. 

I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre having to go to bat on something that shouldn‚Äôt be an issue, but seriously congrats on the win! 

Also thank you for being so supportive of your kiddo <3
Butterflies and toddlers bit had me cackling over har.
I failed gym class every year just because I wouldn't change in front of a bunch of people that already bullied me. The fact that we have to get undressed in front of an adult and other students for grades has always been fucking weird and I will never understand why that's even necessary.
You‚Äôre an amazing parent standing up for your child‚Äôs rights. My 15 yr old son is transgender and i‚Äôve been worrying about her safety in the restrooms.  Her school‚Äôs solution is to allow her to use the bathroom in the nurses office. It‚Äôs a start anyway.  Thank God my child gets to use marching band for her pe credit and does not have to undress or i can imagine we‚Äôd be having the same issues you‚Äôve been dealing with.   Eventually i think they will take such things into consideration when building new schools.  At this time, our kids are just the ones who are breaking the mold.  Hang in there üòä
Well said!
What's wrong with having private changing stalls? Like you said tons of kids have issues changing in front of other people. Not having separate gym clothes is an issue unless it's the very last period of the day. No one wants to sit in a room full of sweaty teenagers.
This is a really good point.
Fully agree with everything here which is a fairly rare occasion. The thought of changing in front of people was fucking wild to me at 6th grade and I couldn‚Äôt imagine doing that being trans (I didn‚Äôt know till about a year ago and I‚Äôm a senior this year) they really should have stalls and have like some of the class go in and change in groups. It would also be greatly appreciated by victims of sa that are really against the idea of undressing around other people
Here, you flunk if you don't wear the uniform. I had 2 gym classes in 10th grade because I didn't change in 9th grade and had to make up the year.
I am sorry to hear you had such a horrible experience with all that nonsense.
She's not on puberty blockers or hrt. She's advanced, puberty wise, and would be a candidate for more than other girls her age might get. I don't know all the details because the one office visit we had cost us $300 out of pocket, with no labs at all.
The only reason I mentioned her transition at all is because there's this false belief that you can't be trans, or at least you can't live as your gender, unless there are medical intervention. To a lot of people, even school staff, my daughter and her friend are just boys in girl clothes until they get a prescription or a surgery.
I really think that if some organized people made a movement out of it, we could get PE uniform mandates eradicated all over. If you stress the pedo angle of it, and that's a real angle, and point out how counterproductive it is to all of the ways we try to teach our kids that they are in charge of who gets to see them undressed, I think it could go the way of teachers paddling students. And there's a great parallel to Chicago's naked swimming. Look it up, it's horrifying.
I completely üíØ percent agree!
It's only legal to force a roomo full of healthy, unrelated, minor childhood to undress against their will in 2 places: school and jail. Anywhere else, it would be a felony.
Son?
My daughter uses a gender neutral bathroom and changes in there. It had been the staff bathroom before this year but they changed it this year.  Last year they'd proposed the office bathroom but the secretary isn't very nice so she just went all day without peeing. The high school put in gender neutral bathrooms, too, which is what the other t girl uses and changes in. The trans kids aren't even using the locker rooms and these parents are angry because they don't even do enough research to know this. I had one of them ask me if there were hormone shots that could make my daughter feel like a boy again. Like, if there were a cute for trans don't you think that's what doctors would do?! And if it were a hormone thing there would be no postmenopausal women, just old men with boobs. These people will look up just enough to bring that Loudoun County rape case up but not enough to even find out what trans means.
They're nothing wrong with it if the money and space is there to put stalls in, and there's not. But the thing is, nobody showers after gym, and nobody tries to make the kids shower, and deodorant wasn't even on the school supply list. The parents I spoke to don't even send it to school with their kids. I have been washing gym clothes on the weekends fora collective 8 years and they've never stunk because the kids don't do anything sweaty now. They walk the track or play dodgeball or volleyball, things that don't involve running. And the bathrooms already have stalls exactly like the ones these parents think will make them happy, and they still have a problem with trans kids in the bathrooms so obviously stalls aren't going to solve their issues.
That last part is what put them on my side about it, I think. I had said that the locker room can be traumatic for any number of reasons, from early development to late development to body hair to scars or birthmarks, and one of the mom's said how horrible it had been for her to not only undress but to be told by an adult that she had no choice in the matter because she had been assaulted by an adult who told her she had no choice but to undress.
If you don't mind me asking, what state are you in? When I started transitioning a big part of what kept be back was the financial aspect of medical treatment, but I found out that there are often times clinics that do sliding scale fees for visits (I ended up paying $25 for each visit as a flat fee, labs included.) And I was able to use Good Rx to get coupons for the meds to bring them to a reasonable cost. I am now on medicaid (IL County Care) and they cover everything except the needles and syringes.
Absolutely, a person is transgender whether or not they medically transition. I just had no idea it was that expensive!  

I am very lucky to live in an informed consent state, and my insurance covers everything. 
I‚Äôm sorry to hear she doesn‚Äôt have access to those things (if she wants them) but she is lucky in that she has a supportive family! 

I didn‚Äôt begin HRT until I was 40 so I know it‚Äôs never too late.
My daughter is the same. No hormones or blockers, but presenting herself fairly comfortably at school this yes as a girl, especially with regard to her clothing choices.
It's so messed up.
I try üòÖ
Yes it‚Äôs going to take a lot if educating people. My husband was one who wondered if my daughter‚Äôs feelings could be changed with hormones, as well üòû
I‚Äôm surprised how sterile and uncaring school systems can be on certain policies. The idea that girls can‚Äôt have bra straps showing under their shirt is 100% there because it distracts the teachers I‚Äôve never seen a studenr stare at a girl cause she had bra straps showing but I‚Äôve seen some teachers do some interesting double takes at certain students and it‚Äôs fucking gross. the dress codes of most schools inherently sexualize children
Also I had to share a locker room with the people who sexually assaulted me so that was a fun experience which makes this issue quite personal to me
Illinois. Whiteside County. Blue cross blue shield of Iowa.
There are 2 accessable places that deal with trans kids, one in Chicago 3hr away and one in Iowa City 1.5 hours away. We went to Iowa. They suggested puberty blockers and said the one they do is a once a year subdermal implant. It cost $20,000 and without insurance you have to pay up front. I went to the local health department because they give free depo shots and the DEPO shot is an old-school puberty blocker but they only help transmen. They are a vagina only clinic. A lot of other places deal with transgender issues but not pediatrics.
I understand why they might think that. I just don't understand not doing a simple Google search. Like, if you're going to make trans children your enemy, wouldn't you research the enemy? I guess the idea is that if estrogen will help her ""be a girl"" then maybe testosterone would help her ""be a boy""? The lady looked so shocked when I told her that medicine had been trying to ""fix"" trans people's brains to match their bodies for hundreds of years before they even entertained the notion of making the body fit the mind. Like, Hello! They tried it your way and it didn't work!
Contact Howard Brown Health in Chicago. It's a good days drive from you, but they can offer affordable care. They do sliding scale and I believe they also take blue cross blue shield. They also partner with Walgreens and can offer discounts in their in house pharmacy. Here is their website. [Howard Brown Health](https://howardbrown.org/#) I'm actually in IL as well and I go there for everything, they are absolutely great. I believe they are also offering telehealth as well and they can request that your insurance cover certain meds that would normally be out of pocket."	qa2kl4	trans	261	0.99	2021-10-17 16:51:04
Wow this hurts	"Just watched the news for the first time in ages, and they did a story on education becoming more LGBT inclusive in Scotland (Where I am) and that's good. But they then revealed that a majority of adults here don't think trans kids should be able to live as the gender they identify as in school, and a very similar majority for using bathrooms on school trips. Now I'm not a kid, nor had I realised I was trans when I was in school, but transphobia being the majority wasn't something I expected. I always thought it was a vocal minority. Ik people call the UK TERF Island, but I always thought Scotland was at least a bit better bc of the laws coming out to help trans people. I guess it wasn't as much better as I thought. This just hurts.

Also this was on BBC Scotland so it should be taken with a grain of salt as to how accurate this information is, as the BBC are pretty awful, but that doesn't make it hurt any less."	"That sucks. Scotland was/is one of those countries I've been keeping in my back pocket in case shit goes to hell here in the US.

Seems like just about no where is ""great"", it's all about what people can tolerate.
That doesn‚Äôt seem to fit with another recent Scottish survey on the issue*; I think they fudged it by lumping the don‚Äôt knows with the nos to fir their agenda, or they just took a skewed poll; considering they‚Äôve unapologetically quoted a rapist in one of their ant-trans pieces, I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.

*Don‚Äôt know the numbers, although only some outright supported us, it was more than those who hated us; most were indifferent or weren‚Äôt quite sure where they stood
Screw them I  wore a skirt and went in the women's bathroom for the first time at school today!
I get the feeling that this is one of those instances where neutral opinions were tossed into the no category

Because where I live in Scotland I've heard very few transphobic things in my life aside from edgy 11 year olds being edgy

And my school is very lgbt friendly considering they've had an informational display up and a queer support group since my very first year here and probably a while before that before that too
It comes from the idea that children couldn't possibly know what's good for themselves, that they might be confused and end up doing serious harm to themselves if they're not controlled.  Their views do make a certain amount of sense if you listen to them; Eugenics also made a certain amount of sense in the 1920's though so......
Another Scot based Trans Person here, and it does seem like all the scare mongering that‚Äôs been happening recent in the US and England is definitely having a negative effect here on the general ignorant masses. A recent study that was release showed a decrease in Trans people feeling safe in their local community.
Still not as bad as some places but I‚Äôm worried for the future for sure
The poor kids. I can say, personally, that the majority of  stuff about coping with being trans I struggle with goes back to childhood. It was all well and truly baked into my poor psyche by 18. I genuinely want to cry seeing kids be forced to go through even a small fraction of that.
Doesnt every man in Scotland wear skirts. It‚Äôs honestly annoying how lots of people just doesn‚Äôt like lgbt
I‚Äôm not sure if this is fully accurate at all ,but I‚Äôve seen people talking about Canada being ok for trans inclusivity. Someone feel free to correct me tho I‚Äôm not 100%.
No place will be. Trans are such a small percentage of the population it will never 'normal' meaning part of the majority. And most countries eith strong religious ties ie Muslim based, are extremely anti gay and anti trans
This actually makes me feel a bit better thanks, I knew the BBC did that with that one article a little while back, and I just generally don‚Äôt like the BBC in general, which is why I did say not to trust how accurate it was. So I‚Äôm not really surprised the poll was fudged. Still hurts that they‚Äôd report that ngl but less now.
I've heard similar things. Proximity to the US gives me worries, though. On the flip side, I literally live close enough to Canada that I accidentally get charged international roaming fees when I visit certain parts of town.
How easy would it be for you to just move to canada? Cause if it‚Äôs easy enough you might be able to try it out for a little while and see if it‚Äôs better than the US. (I‚Äôm from the uk so I have no idea about how easy it would be)
That‚Äôs why I‚Äôm in Hawaii. I‚Äôm hell and gone from all the world‚Äôs BS.
Canada's immigration is rough, from what I've been told (I've looked into it a long while ago).

But I'm also a 30-something with a career, a mortgage, a wife, and two cats. Up and moving would be difficult just from an inertia perspective.
I'm envious.
Ah I see ,good luck to you regardless,hopefully things get better
Thanks."	ud9nte	trans	249	0.98	2022-04-27 17:59:15
I got in a situation where I could have been beat up the other day. Always remember that digression is the better part of valour.	I hid in a bathroom stall for like 15 minutes waiting for them to go away if you are called out do anything you can to avoid being hurt. If it does come down to a fight give them a palm strike to underside of the nose it‚Äôll brake it. If you can avoid a fight or getting hurt do it by any means necessary but if you have to even if you can‚Äôt win give I‚Äôm hell.	"damn that sucks. Just about every fight I've been in has been with someone I trust, so I can't relate to hiding from a fight, but it sucks that you had to deal with that.
Only strike when you are struck, otherwise it is not self -defense. I used to be afraid to fight while growing up but I finally said fuck it. At some point you don't have anything to lose and only confidence to gain. Physical pain is only short term. Getting past your fears can open many doors.
This is why I carry a knife and train with it everyday 

It‚Äôs a karambit and I know it‚Äôs balance like the back of my hand 

Never gonna be a victim
This is good advice. I‚Äôm 100% sure if I wind up in this situation I‚Äôll be too angry and stupid to take it, but it‚Äôs good advice.
Don't listen to people that tell you to be the agressor and attack before being physically hit. Those are the same people that shouldn't own guns.
Never ever palm anyone in the nose. It can kill. Better off running away or taking it that going to prison for murder.
I'm glad you got away. Each of us are worth more than getting hurt fighting some asshole.
I don't trust myself to own lethal weaponry, just in case, but any time I am somewhere I don't know for certain I'll be safe I carry mace at the very least.
I‚Äôve gotten into enough wrestling matches with my boyfriend where I know I wouldn‚Äôt stand a chance. Luckily I don‚Äôt plan on being assaulted anytime soon.
I have a gun, a knife, and a can of whoop ass 

Haven‚Äôt had to use any of them yet, but they‚Äôre ready if needed
Pepper spray is your friend!
That situation happened only once my wife and I went to a club and for whatever reason I was looking particularly good that night I began getting stalked by this guy and when we left he began following us in the car I guess I should‚Äôve beenFlattered but my wife and I both agreed it was actually kind of scary I know it was for sex and he didn‚Äôt want to kill me it‚Äôs still felt scary
Attention seeking?
Train in self defense but avoid altercation. 

I'm sorry that happened. Glad you are safe.
You should never palm strike the underside of the nose, the force can press a part of bone in their brain and kill them, thats terrible advice, instead you should slap the side of their ear with a cupped hand, far less fatal and a guaranteed knockout given you give the correct amount of force.
i hope you‚Äôre safe now, that sounds really horrible. i hope everyone else here can stay as safe as possible through whatever means that is. it‚Äôs a tough fucking world out there
My now fiance, but was a boyfriend in school, was a Godsend. It was mostly ‚Äúmean girls‚Äù being their bitchy little selves. I refused to get into it with them because it could turn into a crap show with their parents saying ‚ÄúHE,‚Äù meaning me, beat up their precious little innocent girls. So my boyfriend who was abnormally tall and strong for a grade six/seven boy, would tell the girls if they did not stop, there would be consequences. Often he would open hand slap their boyfriends or brothers and would say to them to warn the girlfriends it would get worse. After that, it was usually fine. A few of those girls are friends now, and I was a bridesmaid and maid of honour at two of their weddings.

I wish no one needed a protector, but since the LGBTQ+ community is under attack so often, we seem to need one. I tell my friends to learn Krav Maga; you can pick up the basics quickly and learn defence and how to disable the attacker and escape. 

Fianc√© Here - Weapons are not a good way to go. To often they can be turned on you. Knives are extremely deadly in the right hands and guns can kill bystanders. The human body can do significant damage with training. My uncle taught me (he was an ex-Canadian soldier) that if your opponent cannot see, breathe or walk they cannot fight. Breaking the nose causes eyes to water up and breaking one is easy to do, punching or using elbows/shoulder into the upper chest can hinder breathing (no death, but it is painful) and kicking a knee out, especially at a side angle, is devastating, stomping on foot is extremely painful and you will break the little bones. 

If someone grabs you from behind, go limp, fall and roll if you can. You need just one second to change the outcome of an attack. Plus, speaking from experience if you are face to face, plunge a thumb into his eye. I didn't go deep enough to kill so I'm not sure if it's true you can kill someone by doing it, but the attacker will be in severe agony. 

But lastly and most importantly go out in groups to bars, running and screaming FIRE is better than a fight and always mind your surroundings. 

Stay Safe
Physical pain isn't always short term. If you get the shit beaten out of you, it can have longer lasting effects. Nerve damage is real. Be safe.
Never wait to be struck, agression and intimidation IS hostility. If you fear for your safety it is absolutely ok to attack first. It is very easy to make someone feel safe (at least safe enough to not need physical conflict). Doing otherwise and escalating hostility is itself a hostile act. As someone else replied getting hurt can have life long concequences. 

Never wait to be assaulted, it's to late then to properly respond and you've lost the chance to deescalate the encounter. Physical altercations are like chess games the advantage is to the one that strikes first. 

I use to be a VERY masculine alpha male type... 6'4"" 317lbs and ""country boy strong"" and not overweight. When I did get into fights I striked first, if they got within 1-2 feet of me and were displaying aggressive behavior I defended myself. I still believe that the best course of action is to strike first and strike so hard as to end the fight in one blow. My primary move and what I goto first is a choke slam, lift up with all force the opponent by the throat (irrelevant if you damage or kill them by crushing the windpipe) once in the air heave them away with enough force to cause them to achieve a horizontal position as the hit the ground. Done swiftly with agression matching a soldier at war, the fight is over right then (the opponents is unable to breath and prone on the ground). The aggression displayed and the ferocity will deter others from jumping in. 

If this fails they were already going to jump you anyways and you are now percived as a threat to any single one of those people which deters future attempts on their own. They will know it took many of them and that alone what happened to the first guy would have been them. 

Sadly this hyper agressiveness was something I had to develop as a child due to others agressions against me. I never started a fight and often would deescalate altercations between others. I was the skinny nerdy wimp in 9th grade, and by 12th grade I was that guy no one fucks with.

Admittedly it sounds counter productive to be hyper aggressive to prevent agression, however the majority of aggressors were those exhibiting toxic masculinity, of which the only counter is matching and then exceeding their aggressiveness and violence.

For the record I am now 6'2"" 217 lbs, have DD Cup breasts and quite feminine. However I will be dead before I ""allow"" someone to strike me first.
I'd be weary of carrying a knife. If your aggresor doesn't have a weapon, you could be escalating the situation, and be the one in bigger legal trouble. At least that's what it's like here in Canada.
 Also, if they take the knife from you somehow, now they have a weapon. O.O

Anyways, hope you never have to use it.
Sio what happens when you use that knife or worst case The knife gets taken off you and used on you Mate learn to box You don't want a criminal record or go to jail or end up dead with your knife stuck in your guts.
I also carry a karambit and have for the last 8 year! 

People can think what they must about the legal troubles, but so many trans men and women are killed every year. Take the legal judgment over the memorial.
Myth. The whole nose to the brain thing is an urban legend passed down by uneducated dads and poor self defense programs for years (like keys in knuckles come on). You'll break the cartilage, and fragile vessels in there causing severe bleeding which in a lot of circumstances can be enough to shock someone out of attacking. But it's a small target and you're more apt to miss when under adrenaline than actually land that blow. So aim for a target that is hard to miss and inflicts as much damage and pain as possible usually the groin. Either kick for there as hard as you can or grab with a cupping motion and squeeze for all you're worth. But if it's a fight and you're in fear for your life then everything is off the table.  Punch to the throat and break the trachea if you have to. Just know you'll go to jail and have to prove self defense to avoid prison for murder especially if you use a weapon (if they're unarmed and you pull a knife you're going to prison for sure). But if it's your life or there's shouldn't be a contest.

I‚Äôd have a gun but am not currently allowed to
I've never been in a bad enough fight to get any nerve damage or anything like that, but abt 3 years ago I was pressured into playing a slapping game called tennis with the strongest person in the school, and in the end my hand was a deep purple, dotted with black bruises,  swollen, and very painful, and the next month after that ordeal my hand hurt like hell, and even today my right hand hurts more than my left, not sure that's nerve damage but it's def proof that some pain can be permanent.
You shrank two inches... pog
Are you familiar with what a karambit is 
Those are damn near impossible to disarm 

Normally you‚Äôd just leverage the knife out of the assailants hand with blows from opposing directions , a karambit Is essentially attached to their finger
I‚Äôd rather die fighting for my life than let somebody make me an easy victim 

If people wanna kill people for being trans then why shouldn‚Äôt we train to approach a lethal threat with lethal intent and lethal actions
Never be afraid to defend yourself and strike first. Laws be damned, injuries can last a lifetime, never be the agressor but never be the victim. They had their chance to walk away before they got within choke slam range. Always warn someone if they haven't gotten physical yet that your intent if they continue hostility is to cause permanent harm. Ask if they enjoy depth perception as you will blind them if possible. Every single blow of every single physical altercation is a life or death moment. 

Strike first, strike hard, no regrets, no remorse, no mercy.
It‚Äôs not about the brain. There‚Äôs a lot more to the head than the brain.

Don‚Äôt neglect your shoes if you want to actually fight. I‚Äôve been stabbed in the eyes with stiletto heels so I thoroughly recommend adding that if you want to go to prison too. üôÇ
I did police training and martial arts, also boxing but thanks for assuming a shit ton of nonsense about me and the weird lecture about how to hold a key
Our police may be able to act like that with impunity but for us that's how you end up in prison. But sorry to say in the US a trans person in prison is also a very realistic death sentence. Most states won't house you with your identified gender but the sex at birth. So weigh your odds very very carefully.
I know if I am incarcerated I won't make it out. I'll just take it out on everyone in there and maim anyone I come into contact with they'll either have to drug me and hold me in solitairy or have a cell extraction team ready whenever they open my cage cause at that point fuck it I've been ready to die before, at least I'll take someone with me. Be damned if they wana treat me like an animal then that's what they'll get."	mj3x2h	trans	241	0.99	2021-04-03 07:41:18
Had a shitty day (wore this dress and still got misgendered lots) and I lay in bed for awhile when I got home. When I got up to go to the bathroom and looked in the mirror know what I saw? A girl.

Sorry, didn't mean to post this so many times - it said that it was pending  so I just kept on trying to post it again lol :p
Omg how did you get misgendered you pass so well
You're darling sweetie!
That's so awesome! I can't wait for the day i can just look in the mirror and see a girl instead of having to use a Snapchat filter to feel pretty
All those flowers make you seem fun and girly! You‚Äôre in your chrysalis right now and one day soon you‚Äôll wake up and spread your delicate wings! Hugs!!!

I am so sorry you had a rough day. If it makes you feel better I think you look fantastic. One thing I have learned over the years some people suck and they always will. Some people will never understand what is going on. Try to surround yourself with like minded friends it will help. ‚ù§Ô∏èU. Hope you feel better soon üòò
I'm sorry that people are terrible. You truly are a beautiful woman though. Stay positive and show everyone your gorgeous smile.
Always be happy of who you are,you have a beautiful smile
A very pretty girl at that. Hope you are feeling better. Have great day girl!!!!

Took me awhile to realize this was a compliment lol. 
And it‚Äôs hard sometimes but there are also a lot of people who see me for who I am. I‚Äôd like to believe that there are more enlightened people than ignorant ones and that we‚Äôre moving forward as a society. Maybe that‚Äôs just me being naive but believing that makes it easier to get through the bad days.
I took this pic from an angle that minimizes my masc features (I'm close to 6ft tall and have very broad shoulders and narrow hips) and unfortunately I can't minimize those same features in person so that probably plays a role in my getting gendered incorrectly.

[Here's a picture i took a few months ago from a less flattering angle that shows what I'm talking about.](https://i.redd.it/w22tl5hxx5r31.jpg)
Thanks for saying so üòä

You‚Äôre welcome! Thanks for taking my compliment in its intended spirit üòÖüòÅ
Thank you for being you. Hope you are doing better. Looking great!!
Omg thank you üòä
You‚Äôre so kind üíï
That‚Äôs absolutely true that we need re-education. I mean I don‚Äôt think that most people go out of their way to be hurtful - like 9/10 if someone misgenders me it‚Äôs because that person is just ignorant and not trying to be an asshole. I think that teaching kids when they‚Äôre young that people come in all different shapes and sizes and that some people are assigned the wrong gender at birth is super important in combating that ignorance. 
Also thank you for your kind words üíï
That‚Äôs so nice of you to say!

Can someone be proud of me right now?	So, I don‚Äôt really know how to start this- I‚Äôm a sophomore in high school, and I‚Äôm a trans guy that lives in a transphobic household. Recently, my old English teachers recommended my story for the scholastic writing competition and was super excited about me submitting one of my flash fiction stories. It‚Äôs about a trans guy called Andrew who goes into the men‚Äôs bathroom for the first time. Unfortunately, due to my home situation, I can‚Äôt submit my work without telling my parents. It‚Äôs really getting to me mentally, not just because I can‚Äôt enter the competition, but because my parents will never know I was given the opportunity and I don‚Äôt have many people to be proud of me. Any sort of advice or support would be loved.	"You created something awesome and meaningful! I'm super proud of you and you should be proud of yourself too!
Seriously, good job! One day the support will come, if not from them, from those you choose to surround yourself with. \*hugs\*
That takes alot of guts and  foremost please stay encouraged and true to yourself. Big hugs and love sent your way.  I am very proud of you. I am sorry you have to live in a household of such toxic environment of non acceptance not feeling safe that sounds really difficult.
i‚Äôm proud of you
Is it possible that they‚Äôll believe it was just a story and not a relation to you at all? 
Btw I‚Äôm so proud of you! That‚Äôs so amazing that you were considered for that!
I am proud of you, that is a great accomplishment!!!My daughter is trans so I know how important it is to have support. Is it not possible for your teacher to submit the story without your parents approval? Can you post it somewhere?  Like A03? Or is that just for fanfiction? I would love to read it.
I'm very proud of you. Being a good writer is a real accomplishment.
Hey dude, that sounds like a great piece of writing and I‚Äôm hoping you‚Äôll get to smash the competition. However even if you don‚Äôt get to submit it due to shit parents, that‚Äôs so damn amazing to be nominated man. I‚Äôd love to read the story if you ever put it anywhere. 

My only suggestion is just show your parents a falsified story and claim it‚Äôs the submission entry and just let the real one go in
We can all be proud AF of u‚Ä¶ and we are‚Ä¶
Wondering are U proud of u?!?! That‚Äôs what matters most üñ§
Could you send me a copy of your writing thing? I‚Äôd like to read it
Good job buddy :)
Hey, proud of you for getting that recommendation.
Have you tried a pseudonym?
Another mamma of a trans child that is SO PROUD of you and for you! Be safe kiddo,but be proud because you are helping by being so,every damn day. Lots of us love you just as you are and would give mad hugs just because üíú
That is a huge compliment for your teacher to recognize you, your story and your talent for writing! That probably means she would go to bat for you writing scholarship recommendation letters for college too! You obviously stand out as a student in her eyes. Yes, this is definitely something to be proud of!  Congratulations!! Your story could make a great college essay too. Maybe you can go ahead and write this great story! I‚Äôm sure there are many who would be interested. I am very proud! I know this is huge! Can the story perhaps be submitted anonymously by your teacher on your behalf or you use a ghost name as author?
I‚Äôm proud of you. By that I mean PROUD üëè OF üëè YOU. That kernel of hope in your hear, that it‚Äôs going to get better?  Feed it, love it, grow it. There‚Äôs going to be a time where you get to shine for EVERYONE and that‚Äôs going to be a glorious day.
I'll be proud of you for writing the story. It takes a lot to be willing to show people your art. You were brave to want to show it
Keep writing. At some point you will be old enough to publish it. The more you write the better you will get.
You got this
You‚Äôre amazing and talented and we‚Äôre all more proud of you than you can know!
That‚Äôs really cool, I‚Äôm proud of you.
Wow congratulations! ü•∞  Sounds really special to be recognized for your writing, and I would love if you could fully receive recognition for that.

I hope you can find other venues to share it, and continue to find people in your life who will celebrate you ‚ù§Ô∏è
We're proud of you! Writing is a noble art form indeed. Perhaps you could explain to you teacher the situation at home, maybe they can help.  Hell if that doesn't work, post it on one of the forums here! I'm sure people would love to encourage creative endeavors üòäüëç
Man that‚Äôs so cool, proud of you brother!
Happy and proud.
Boy, I am proud of you.
So proud of you!! Sending virtual hugs!

My family is queer-phobic too, so this hits home hardü•≤. But I hope you can present your work in the future when it is safer for you to do so!
From one trans man writer to another, I am so proud of you. A sophomore in high school!! A million more opportunities will come your way, especially since you‚Äôre showing so much promise already. Don‚Äôt stop writing and don‚Äôt give up hope. 

If you ever wanted your work published or put out there, I‚Äôd maybe suggest online zines or free literary magazines. You might not get any money, but you‚Äôll be getting your work out there even to a small group of people. And if you wanted to totally cover your tracks, use a pseudonym! And in the future, when you can, you can list that pseudonym on whatever platform you use and proudly take all the credit you deserve. But if you cant or don‚Äôt want to do that, that‚Äôs okay too!

You accomplished something. Your work made someone else eager to share it and that‚Äôs important, and it will happen again and again and again. I am very, very proud of you.
Tricky situation but kudos to you for your work being deemed good enough by your English teacher to be nominated for the competition.

I am not sure what to suggest except perhaps discuss the matter with your English teacher, they sound supportive and may have some ideas about how you could approach your home situation.

Regardless of any other considerations, I would hope your family might put aside their personal opinions on the topic and instead consider what a positive impact the submission of your story could have on your future (especially if it ranks well in the competition).

I am sure your English teacher would not have recommended your story for submission if they did not think it had a chance of doing well.
Dude that‚Äôs amazing!! And incredibly admirable for so many reasons. Please keep writing. And just imagine how many people would be able to connect with you this way this is fantastic
My wife and I are very proud of you. Congratulations!!!
It sounds amazing! If you ever get to share it, I would love to read it :]

And don‚Äôt worry‚Äî I‚Äôm extremely proud of you, you‚Äôre trying to come out of your shell and out to the world and I think that‚Äôs absolutely amazing.

*hugs*
Immm proud of you honeys!
Hey! I'm a trans writer too. There are tons of places you could submit a flash story to that aren't scholastic if you wanted, and your parents never need to know. My mother doesn't know I write and I've got a good amount of publications. DM me if you want more info. And congrats! Flash fiction rocks and so do you.
You are strong and you will get through this. You are a man through-and-through and we all support you. I hope things will get better for you.
That's awesome dude!

Have hope, because someday you might get to tell them.

Could you tell them that you submitted something, but be vague about the details? 

Either way we're proud of you. üòÉ
I'm proud of you
Storytelling is no small task. Few people do it well out the gate and fewer still even try. The fact that yours was recommended speaks volumes about your talent as a writer as well as the story you chose to tell. We need more trans writers in the world, and I'm super proud of you for being one of them. <3
That is truly amazing. Is there a way to get your parents to sign the entry form without them reading it. Maybe you could have them read another work instead? I would hate for you to miss out on this opportunity.
I am proud of you my bro! You got this and you always will. Never stop moving forward whatever the obstacle you encounter. ‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è‚ö°Ô∏è
You are awesome. Period. End of story.
Good job son, teachers don‚Äôt just submit anything.
Being a writer is hard, and being recognized for you talents is always a wonderful thing. I am very proud of you, and I hope you are proud of what you have accomplished too.
Oh kiddo we are proud of you!! ‚ù§‚ù§ The fact that you were considered is AMAZING!!! Keep up the fantastic work!!
I‚Äôm very proud of you. Not only did you express yourself in what sounds like a deeply meaningful and profound manner, you did it when it takes real bravery. I really admire people with the strength to be themselves.
I‚Äôm so proud of you. :) You‚Äôll have your day, honey. üíú
I‚Äôm super proud of you! I‚Äôm sure you‚Äôll have much more success to come! üòä It‚Äôs very difficult when families aren‚Äôt supportive but you will find your people who will love you more than anythingüíï
Thank you darlin‚Äô:] I am proud of myself! It‚Äôs just discouraging that my parents can‚Äôt be proud. It means a lot <3 Thank you again
Thank you <3 I really appreciate it. *hugs*
It means a lot to me <3 It means a lot to have support people out there. Thank you so much, and I will stay true to myself.
Thank you <3 means a lot.
Thank you <3 Unfortunately not though- It‚Äôs extremely clear that it‚Äôs about a trans man, and according to my English teacher, it‚Äôs very obvious it‚Äôs ‚Äúfrom the heart‚Äù
Thank you so much!!! Unfortunately, there‚Äôs no way around my parents. It would be a wonderful opportunity, and probably look good on my future college resume, but I can‚Äôt risk being outed. It means a lot to me! I wrote it my freshman year of high school, but missed the mark to enter it last year, so my teacher wanted me to try this year. 

Thank you for being proud <3 It truly does mean a lot.
Thank you <3 It means a lot to me. Genuinely
Thanks bud. I really appreciate that. I‚Äôll pitch the suggestion to my English teacher!
Thank you <3
As far as advice is concerned, can you submit it under a pseudonym?
No problem.
Are you certain your parents will see it that way? Maybe they‚Äôll be more forgiving if you just say you were inspired by something?
Sounds like you got an awesome English teacher, I am doubting they would lie to you and it is no doubt a good story. Maybe see if you can publish it to other zines or something under an alias? Anyway, good on you and there will be a time that you won't have to worry about family like that. I would listen to my English teacher if I were you, sounds like they support you.
Could you ask your teacher to submit it on your behalf, under a different name maybe (like chosen name, last initial)?
I think u could ask someone u know who would be willing to do it for you and at least u would be able to in some way claim or at the very very least know how good ur story is
They‚Äôre not that forgiving. They would want to read it. Besides, whoever wins gets their story published on the website with their names attached. It would be something they could see, and I‚Äôm in a place where I have too much to lose if I‚Äôm outed. It‚Äôs not a risk I‚Äôm willing to take.
There's also a lot of places that may accept your work (magazines, other competitions) without your parents having to know!

Off the top of my head, I know that Queerlings has a submission deadline on 02/26/2023, and they're explicitly looking for more fiction pieces: https://www.queerlings.co.uk/submit

Stone of Madness Press opens in March: [https://stoneofmadnesspress.com/](https://stoneofmadnesspress.com/)

It's hard being a queer or trans student writer (I had the same problem as you when I was submitting to scholastic), but there's lots of things that you can also try without your parents' explicit permission. I hope you can get your piece published!
Damn, I‚Äôm really sorry. Congrats regardless though! And it sounds like that teacher is really supportive so at least you have someone supporting you
Any chance you could get the teacher to get it submitted anonymously?
Yeah! Thank you."	z1g3n1	trans	227	0.98	2022-11-22 01:06:54
Recently saw a post from a guy saying he'd follow a trans woman into a bathroom and attack her to 'see what's in her pants'. Just a thought... creeps like that may not want to actually know what's in your pants when they end up staring down the barrel of it.		"That's ludicrous. So he wants to see what's in your pants but we are in the wrong!?
Too many people think we are joking. This shit happens to trans people in America and our fellow Americans tell us that we are the ones overreacting. It's why I carry
Arm trans people
I agree 100% because if they find me in a dumpster,  they are gonna find my assailant lying next to me.
Sig is always a good choice! Honestly I wish more trans people would arm themselves.
Pew pew
Hell yeah, I fucking hate the bathroom
I will always advocate carrying for self defense. Because when seconds matter the police are only minutes away.
*We're* the perverted creeps
I love your flag on the slide.
Great content right here
I'm guessing you're from one of a handful of US states? The vast, overwhelming majority of humans would be in serious legal trouble if they were found to be carrying a firearm in public. I'll stick with pepper spray thank-you very much. (Which, incidentally, is also illegal where i live, but the consequences are much less severe so it's worth the risk.)
so a man is going to walk into a bathroom and attack a woman? you couldn't make this shit up, the cognitive cissonance is real
Death to transphobes :)
Shit like this is why I've bought 3 firearms in the last 2 months and gotten myself a CCL for my state. Hate and bigotry are running rampant against all LGBTQ+ individuals. Time to use the Right's bullshit against them and play their laws against them.
Yeah I really hate guns so I cant encourage this post but tazers and pepperspray are still good options and we should definitely defend ourselves cause jezus people can be scary...
Damn Skippy!
Put it on an ak47 blyat
Wtf is wrong with people
time to commit a crime against this person (don‚Äôt actually i just think they would deserve to if they actually did that and are evil for saying that)
I love the idea of carrying, so much so I open carry almost every time I go out. Ioen carry is legal where I live (NV) I only started because of the virus, but I dont think I will stop even when this ends. It limits my wardrobe choices for now. When I get My ccw I plan on only carrying concealed so I can wear my cute dresses again lol
Uhhh sweet gun tho 
I guess after 5 years military instructions from my ex military dad and a locker full of guns in my room to got the image of the weird gun loving psychopath üòÖüòÖ
IKR, it‚Äôs so bizarre to me that they can say shit like this and still somehow think they‚Äôre being righteous.
Is that a question you'd ask a regular girl? Or a regular guy?
Absolutely
i want to get the knife you can get the gun
I totally intend to conceal carry a Beretta 92 Compact in a purse
Y'all must be American
Yeah my Ruger Blackhawk 357m is a bit large so this is gonna be my EDC. Send me a PM sometime if you want to BS about firearms.
Ditto. Once I get my LTCH again, I plan to carry my Springfield XD-m45 everywhere I can.

My slide has 6 chevron serrations on the back end, and 6 != 5x for any x element of the integers, so I might not be able to do this.

Although, there are those new trans-specific flags I've seen in r/QueerVexillology that are specificly chevrons. Things that make you go Hmmm.
>n the states is that Texas is/prefers to be its

Really, really wish I could, But australia is kinda backwards, no armed self defense :c
""Suck my fuck""
i mean im not, hopefully
I love you both
Thanks ^-^
That's really sad that you arent allowed to protect yourself. Best wishes and hopes go out to you.
Tazers require a spread to be effective, dont work with heavy clothing, and if you know to roll on the ground to break the wires you can defeat them. OC/pepper spray sucks but if I know what's happening that isnt going to stop me from choking the life out of you.
They're definitely better than nothing. I would suggest some sabre red over a tazer as the effects continue and it can be used on multiple attackers but I would take my pistol any day. Why do you hate guns curiously?
regular? who says we arnt
Not just American but Texan here
Both fair points. I don't know the right way to deal with this.aybe there isnt a right way. Im just very wary of guns and especially of guns being promoted for use against people.
Because the purpose of guns is to kill things, including humans. I don't like things getting killed. Sure, guns can also be used for entertainment, but there plenty of other types of entertainment that don't require deadly weapons and unless you're doing it for wildlife preservation (as in shooting out of control animal populations) I don't love shooting animals for fun either.

I don't want anyone to have the power to kill that guns give you. Since it's needed sometimes I'm okay with reserving that priveledge for police, provided they are trained to use restraint, which not all police forces around the world are. It's a nuanced topic, I won't pretend to have all of the answers.
I'm honestly not sure how to answer that question..... Still a rather rude thing to ask someone.
Hey me too! North Texas specifically.
Mate, Texas is in america.
The way I see it you have to ask yourself if you're willing to die to save the bigot bringing down a crowbar on your skull. I've made peace that if I'm ever in that situation I would defend myself with all necessary force. I'm a firefighter and trainee EMT and I care about people deeply and it's not something I take lightly, but when the line comes to me or them I know where I stand.
I'm an avid hunter who agrees that trophy hunting is wasteful and generally scummy imo. I participate in events like the pheasant hunt in Dalhart specifically because theres a big cookout and you eat what is killed. You should eat or donate the meat to someone who will (or do trades like part of the meat for a return of summer sausage, yum). And I wont get too into it but there are many ways to kill people outside of guns that are even more readily availible such as motor vehicles.
i wasn't trying to be rude sorry
Ah that's neat. I'm also north Texas.
""Not just- Idiom- Definition of¬†not just
‚Äîused to say that one thing is true and that another thing is also true"" - Merriam Webster Dictionary. 

It's used to show both things are true but provide an emphasis. Thanks for 'in-correcting' me though.
Mate, saying I'm not only an american but a texan american doesnt mean I'm not in the USA. For example ""I not only am a car owner, I'm a Lamborghini owner"". You're just putting emphasis on something about what type of car or in this case what type of american you are.
A ""running gag"" in the states is that Texas is/prefers to be its own country.
Honestly, hearing your description you might be one of the people I would trust to wield a firearm. Not everyone on reddit is a firefighting EMT, though.

That said, being prepared to shoot someone might make you more likely to do it and as I said... I just don't like being th√°t prepared to take a life.
Sure, eating what you hunt sounds good to me. I don't eat meat myself but eating what you hunt is better for the environment than buying meet which means I'm mostly for it. 

I don't think the comparison with motor vehicles is fair. Yeah, you can kill with it, but it has other functions. Like driving places, it's primary function by far. Guns are just things to use to kill stuff, it doesn't do anything else.

I hope it's clear I'm trying to have a good faith argument. I know this is an issue close to many people's heart and I want to be open to what you're saying. A lot of your arguments are making me think which is always a good experience!
[removed]
Because before it was one of the States United, it **was** its own country.
Oh ok
Yeah, there weren't many, but living there for a few years i saw some 'secede' bumper stickers.  In the end though, they're pretty similar to a lot of the rest of America, or at least as i see it living in the midwest now
Honestly the background I think that makes the most difference is that I grew up hunting and shooting. I had gun safety drilled into me since I was a kiddo and being a farm and ranch kid I grew up quick. I think most people are fine with the appropriate training, experience, and respect for the tool. And I'm for sensible measures like extensive backgrounds and no-brainer limitations.
There are guns made specifically for competition target shooting such a silhouette guns. And I think where we differ is that I view killing as a good thing at times like for food, for protecting yourself or others, etc. I see firearms as a tool. There are millions of gun owning americans who are perfectly responsible and often times outnumber those who are out to harm others (points to many instances of gun owning bystanders stopping an attack). By trying to regulate guns I feel that you only impact those who would be able to protect themselves or others. Those in the mindset to carry out an attack on a large scale often font intend on surviving it thus making the acts illegal kinda useless.
Next time you decide to be smartass and correct someone atleast be right about it *shrug*
I see the difference. I live in the Netherlands and I never knew anyone who owned a gun. Worst I encountered was that one creepy kid in class eho collected knives. Maybe training is the way. Even so, I'd rather limit the distribution of death machines, no matter their form.
Maybe ""good guys with guns"" do outnumber ""bad guys with guns"", but it only takes one bad guy to do a whole lot of damage. Damage that's much harder to do if they don't have that gun. If you really think gun regulations won't help, I advice you to look at the countries that have them. I thought you were in favor of regulating guns, though, from your earlier comment?
I wasnt being a smart ass, it just isnt important in this situation to make the distribution that your Texan
I can make a slam gun with scap I have lying around. Here is the US there are openly availible plans for creating guns with a hacksaw in your garage (the things like the Serbu GB22). And I am ok with some regulations like 100rd drums, fully automatics, etc.
Are you aware that Texas is generally associated with firearms and gun ownership? The person was pointing out that general sentiment about America and I was emphasizing that I'm additionally in the best known state for gun ownership within America. So by making the distinction that I'm a Texan it adds additional context as well as points out other stereotypes which was the original discussion at hand
But you think smaller firearms schouldnt be regulated then? Why?
I'm English how the fuck would I know about Texas and gun ownership, personally I'm against guns so this entire things laughable to me. It's clear were from different cultures so I'm done with this conversation
Because I grew up around gun owners and never did the dozens and dozens of them ever do anything that would warrant restrictions. Why would we punish millions for the acts of a handful? As long as the guns are reasonable I see no problem.
Yeah I'm very pro gun and likely very different culturally. I grew up shooting and hunting all my life and feel much more comfortable being a gun owner who's able to defend myself. I'd rather put three hollow points in the chest of the transphobe trying to kill me than die waiting for cops to show up. Just personal preference though.
This isn't a classroom where we're taking the school pet away because some of the kids didn't feed it. This is a country where gun related violence is a common occurance. You should be ""punishing"" those millions because that handful is regularly going on killingsprees.
Perhaps give everyone that is eligible a gun at 21 including teachers. That would also probably drop the crime rate. People are more apprehensive when they know they going to immediately be filled with lead.
The amount of accidents would skyrocket. The amount of people killed in a drunken fight would skyrocket. Give people more guns and gun violence rises. Do you really think this is a good solution?
Gun training would be mandatory to get the freebie and you cant legally carry in a bar. Also there are places like Isreal that essentially hand you a gun at 18 along with your mandatory military training and have very low rates."	ggc1v9	trans	223	0.95	2020-05-09 08:55:07

That's a lot of adjectives to describe me! :) (although i dunno about integrity haha) What are YOUR adjectives?
I would definitely say friendly, approachable, sensual and loyal for starters... üòÄ
Oh sensual. That's a good word. What are some... verbs you embody? :P
Animated, proactiveness, generosity and affectionate for starters.

Last night‚Ä¶	"Last night, my mom came into my room, saying that she couldn‚Äôt sleep. She proceeded to talk about how she ‚Äúworries about me‚Äù and stays up at night because of it. She also said that she wonders why I prefer to stay at home by myself and seclude myself, instead of going out and hanging with friends‚Ä¶ She wonders why I want to do just that (I so badly wanted to tell her that ‚ÄúI am trans, and I‚Äôm not backing down‚Äù, but I kept my mouth shut)‚Ä¶ She wonders ‚Äúwhy I don‚Äôt text my girlfriend at all, almost like I‚Äôm not interested in her‚Äù (yet my mom doesn‚Äôt know the full story)‚Ä¶ She then told me that I needed to work on some parts of my life like ‚Äúmy walk with Christ‚Äù, which granted, isn‚Äôt perfect rn, but I can‚Äôt work on that at the moment‚Ä¶ I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in my body enough to be able to do that. I feel like I‚Äôm in a simulation of an alternate reality where I was chosen to be male, but in reality, I‚Äôm a girl‚Ä¶ I just want to wake up from this reality.

After about 30 mins of chatting, she proceeded to say, ‚ÄúI love you. I just want you to be safe and happy‚Äù‚Ä¶ ‚ÄúI am worried that you are hiding something from me‚Ä¶ You stay in the bathroom with your phone in your hand (is there a camera somewhere?) I want to allow you to be an adult, but I can‚Äôt do that right now when you aren‚Äôt taking care of yourself properly right now.‚Äù

Well, if you want me to be happy, then let me take control of my life and not worry about the consequences‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs my life after all‚Ä¶ I WANT autonomy."

This sounds like emotional manipulation, definitely seems like a red flag for something, especially if she's potentially got a camera in your friggin bathroom... Idk, I don't have a very good relationship with my parents for a number of reasons, but I'm pretty sure you really shouldn't be going into your child's room in the middle of the night and unloading all this emotional baggage like that.
It sounds like she suspects something and is fishing.  No telling how she‚Äôll respond if you are open and honest, but as long as you feel safe doing so, it be worth a try. üòå
Sit with her and tell her. It's just going to cause both of you endless amounts of pain if she's already aware something is going on. Not gonna lie, it's gonna be hard, but sounds to me like it's time. Look to her as an ally.
Sounds like she suspects something. If you need to get her off the trail, come up with another explanation thats plausible and kind of true and if it gets to a point where she presses about it, feed that story to her. Story could be that people at school are making fun of you, that you did badly at a class/test/sport, etc.
May not be the case, but coming in as perspective from someone as a parent or at parent age.

She may actually be very worried about you and want to make sure you are ok. One of the BIGGEST fears of a parent is your child hiding their pain, especially if they are worried you may harm yourself, and they live with a life of ""I could have done something"". Being antisocial, shut in, avoiding established relationships are all red flags. I'd be pressing my child if I was noticing the same thing. But it's hard to do, because if you push your child too hard they may resist even harder. 

If you can, at least give her some assurance so if she does have fears they are relieved.
I think she wants you to be honest with her. She senses something like a lot of Mothers do. She may be a fantastic supporter. Won‚Äôt know unless you start opening up
That hard 

But you have to tell your mom she seems like Support one even if she's not, in the end she will know

Good luck üëç

I put on make up to go see my boyfriend and the dysphoria was strong. I can't even today...	"I'm pre everything FtM. Should have added that, sorry!

It was just a little natural lipstick, fake eyelashes and eyeliner since my eyelashes are a light brown and not very visible, and a teeny bit of blush. And I looked like a clown. I cried until the make up ran down my face. I feel horrible. I'm not a woman. I never have been. The one time I want to be, I look like a fool. And I don't have make up wipes and I'm sitting in my bathroom typing this and I'm so sad..."	"Oh no the comments thinking you're MtF...  
I'm really sorry, I understand how you feel. I live with a religious family and I have to present feminine everyday... my sister is also having a wedding soon so you already know I'm gonna have to get dolled up. Fucking hate the feeling so much. It's like I'm trying to fight the urge to rip all my clothes off. Thankfully I think they will let me wear fancy shirt/pants outfits for any house parties we have... nothing to suspect here mom I promise... I just uhhh can't walk in long clothes! Yeah...   
You'll get through <3 I believe in you king
I understand this so much, back in college I let a friend do makeup for me one day because she looked excited. Both her and her friend said I looked beautiful but when I saw myself I felt like a clown. 

I scraped it off as best as possible before my next class and cried the whole time.
Tactical hug incoming
Just realised my mistake I'm really sorry
You are YOU, and that‚Äôs always enough no matter what! I‚Äôm mtf but I can relate to the feelings. Stay strong and just keep being you! 

And don‚Äôt give up on makeup just yet, sometimes it takes a while to find why you like and what works and what doesn‚Äôt. Just keep trying and eventually you will find a look that works for you no matter how you want to present!

Oops Wrong Bathroom	"Yesterday I (25MtF) was in the bathroom at work (not out yet) washing my hands, and a guy walks in, turns the corner to see me. They visibly jump, terrified, gasp, about face, hit the wall, say ""SORRY!!"", and rush back out.  


I was visibly confused for a moment before my brain caught back up and processed that he must have seen me, thought he walked into the women's restroom and freaked out.

Hopefully he didn't rush to the women's room after that.
I was using a public bathroom and i wasn‚Äôt confident enough to use the women‚Äôs, so i used the men‚Äôs and some guy walked in, saw me, and looked back at the door to make sure he was in the right bathroom  

That was a pretty good feeling

I‚Äôm frustrated with my workplace not having a family/unisex restroom	"I think they get away with it because there‚Äôs a sign by both sets of bathrooms stating there‚Äôs a changing station in both the men‚Äôs and the women‚Äôs. But that really poses an issue for me.

I am trans femme and while I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm a woman or not I am definitely not a man. I have been on hrt for a while now and I am definitely starting to look more passively feminine but I still have very masculine traits such as the beard I wear because my partner likes it and if I regret shaving it it will take absolutely forever to grow back at this point.

I do wear a mask regularly and it does cover it up but my issue is that I fear I will make the people in the women‚Äôs uncomfortable that there‚Äôs a ~~man~~ in the bathroom but at the same time going into the men‚Äôs not only causes me extreme dysphoria and makes me question if I‚Äôm even trans somehow(?!?!) I feel very unsafe because I‚Äôm worried about being attacked even more so than I am about being attacked in the women‚Äôs. 

But even if I did use the women‚Äôs I‚Äôve heard more than a few stories of transphobic women getting transphobic men to go into the women‚Äôs to beat up trans women who may or may not pass. 

Sorry for the rant I‚Äôm just very frustrated."	"hobby lobby lost a court case for not allowing a trans woman to use the womens restroom.
Do you want a hug?
I think it would be an issue of discrimination for the workplace to not have a gender inclusive restroom on site. I would talk to HR if you feel comfortable. My workplace for instance has an ""all gender"" restroom and a men's restroom on a few floors and a women's and men's on other floors.
i am for sure a trans male and i hate non gender neutral bathrooms because i feel very uncomfortable in the woman‚Äôs restroom and very unsafe in mens restrooms because my presentation is very queer all places should have gender neutral bathrooms for the general safety of trans people
If you are out at work and there is an opportunity to address staff in a group with a text chain or at location I'd just go ""Yo I'm trans I'm using the women's bathroom now just so y'all aren't surprised...I don't give a fuck about you I just want to use the toilet.""  
Maybe phrase it nicer or add like ""If any women have any problems with it please speak up now so we can address them.  


I generally just brute force the situation because I can't deal with this whispering, wondering...sneakily wait for you to come out before they go and all that stuff so I just put it out there this is what's happening I have no ulterior motives. Thank you for your attention. üòÅ
I think the idea of 3d party restrooms are a very big issue right now, just looking at costs, a lot of people are reluctant. Not to mentaion the fact so many people think that it‚Äôs just gonna be used by pedos. I think the best call is to speak with whoever‚Äôs in charge and tell them it makes you feel uncomfortable. It may take awhile for people to get used to the idea so you should be as patient as you can in the process, and if they ignore your request, it‚Äôs up to you on what to do next
Some place don‚Äôt event think about this ! I hope they install one soon
Ya I know the feeling. I‚Äôve just started to not care. It‚Äôs basically the same. It‚Äôs a bathroom. Everyone goes to the bathroom. So why can‚Äôt we go to the bathroom??
Depending where you live you could bring up discrimination in the workplace and the need for a family restroom to your HR department. Because I doubt you're the only trans person to set foot in your store. For the time being, if you could just use the restroom at home or in another location that has a neutral bathroom on your breaks, I would. But I totally understand if that isn't doable.
Sorry to hear this. I know in some states, My state Oregon for example, there are workplace laws in place requiring the allowance of using the restroom you identify with, even if that changes each time you go. So even if the company or HR didn't offer protection the state statutes would. Might be worth looking into.
I just use the restroom that alines with my sex.
You guys don't have an employee bathroom? If your too comfortable there to switch jobs I'd talk with management (if you think they'll be cool that is) about any solutions for you, who knows there might be a hidden single bathroom somewhere, we had one upstairs at our restaurant. If you are thinking of switching jobs soon ask about a gender neutral bathroom in the interviews/look for them. I just transferred to a new place and like the second restaurant I worked at they have single room bathrooms, where as my old place had the one upstairs and then regular stall bathrooms for customers. I wish you the best of luck and also to say this, most of the times, people just want to get in and get out. They're not going to be studying everyone who goes in unless they're a real creep. If you just keep your head down and don't talk to people they won't think anything of it. In the meantime at least, I wish you the best of luck, and I hope you stay safe and happy even with all the struggles we have to deal with. It's slowly getting better everywhere, I run into maybe one asshole a month where five years ago it was every day. Just keep pushing and being you!
Im so sorry :( i feel like every establishment should be required to have a unisex/family restroom for trans people and well, families!
GENDER NEUTRAL POOPING STATIONS PLEASE WHY DO WE NEED TO MAKE THINGS COMPLICATED WHEN IT COULD BE SIMPLE AAAAAAAAAAAAA

Seriously though why tf is there even a separation for bathrooms, poop stinks regardless of who's hole it comes from and tampons are not thrown at the walls either so I simply have no idea why we separate them. Just make one big room with lots of pooping stations with individual doors and move on.

And please don't say men aren't able to aim or sit down when peeing. Please. Men aren't handicapped people, and even when they are they can STILL SIT DOWN. I have no idea why men find that degrading but come on fellas, your masculinity isn't supposed to be THIS fragile.
That was under state law, in a state with friendly laws (Illinois). Not to diminish her accomplishment, but it's not the same everywhere else.
Thank you
It‚Äôs a department store so I don‚Äôt know how well that would go over lol
I think all workplaces should have an employee restrooms in the back away from customers. I rarely go out of my way to use the main restrooms when I can just use the staff ones
You have perfectly summed up my frustration. Thank you. Men are kinda scary in general for any openly queer people I‚Äôve found especially cis men
Thanks for the advice
Exactly my way of doing things. And I don't really tend to phrase it nicer, in fact that's usually the opposite. I've been a waiter for almost 10 years and opening a restaurant, I can't be bothered to handle bigotry anymore.
I understand why logisticly but I‚Äôm still chuffed
Me too but I‚Äôm not counting on it
I feel the same way. It‚Äôs a room full of toilets, why do we make such a big deal out of it? Why are they even gendered at all? It‚Äôs dumb.
I strive to have your level of confidence
That is wildly unhelpful but thanks
Same here but alas,,,
*OSHA recommended as well*
Everyone get over here and offer op hugs
*gives hug*
As an enby who tries not to go to the bathroom in public because gendered bathrooms make me uncomfortable, I think it would be great if department stores had all gender restrooms. But I see what you mean. I think the other person's comment about staff restrooms is good. If y'all have separate bathrooms, ask that one ve designated differently. Nonetheless, I think it is an issue of discrimination and HR would be obligated to figure it out for you.
That would be great if there was space, but it‚Äôs usually at a premium in retail stores.
yes it makes going to the bathroom in public so hard esp at my old job i‚Äôd just hold it bc i could not handle it i don‚Äôt understand why gender neutral bathrooms aren‚Äôt standard everywhere
Something that could help try to find another single use bathroom, where can lock it or something.
I feel like it stems from men standing to pee. I don‚Äôt get the point of urinals when u can just use a stall?
Ya it started when I worked fast food and the restrooms have like 2 stalls. And if I have to pee I‚Äôm gonna pee lol

Came out to my mom yestersay. It was amazing.	"31yo mtf. Decided yesterday when I got to work that I needed a mental health day. So I went home, did some voice practice with a planned coming out speech, and decided to text my mom that I needed some help with something. I greeted her in my prettiest outfit, told her to just come inside and sit down so we could talk. She was already concerned about me from asking for help (not normal for the old me, lol)

I had a whole speech planned, but she had to use the bathroom when she got there. Realizing I have a big card stuck to my bathroom mirror that says ""Anna, you are BEAUTIFUL"" I decided to just blurt it out.

Me- ""Mom, I'm a woman.""
Mom- ""Thank GOD!"" *runs to bathroom*

She was on board right away. I made us some tea, sat her down and read my speech anyways. We both happy cried and hugged eachother a bunch. I told her she's the only person I ever wanted to be like and we went shopping.

I dont know what I was so scared of.

I have the urge to do the same, and I think it's gonna go fine enough knowing her.

I'll probably still do it because I have the urge to ^^'.

I got kicked out of both bathrooms	Last night I had a band competition and we had to change into uniform at school. I‚Äôm trans masc and have only been out this year, so some people are still trying to get used to it. I walked into the mens restroom and everyone stared at me. I had multiple people ask why I was in there, even though I was just standing and waiting for a stall to open. After a while I got uncomfortable so I left and went into the woman‚Äôs restroom, where my friend proceeded to physically push me out telling me I need to use the mens bathroom because I identify as male. I told the band director and she just told me to use the unisex teachers restroom. I kind of understand why I made all the guys uncomfortable with me not really using that bathroom, but that really upset me. I usually don‚Äôt use the mens restroom in fear of getting jumped or hurt. My best friend told me it would be different when we moved schools, and I hope it does because I don‚Äôt want to be separated because people don‚Äôt see me as who I am.	"I recently started uni and the unisex toilets are a lifesaver! You should be able to use whichever makes you feel comfortable but I understand the nervousness and sometimes I have to resort to just using the one I‚Äôve been using for years. You should definitely be much more comfortable at a new school though so don‚Äôt lose hope :)
Big hugs.  Bathrooms and the uncomfortableness there is an absolute PITA!  Sorry you had to go through that headache!  It will get better as you establish yourself!
Yeah a lot of people will only validate our genders when it means excluding us in some way while patting themselves on the back and letting transphobes exclude and invalidate us without saying shit.


Reminds me of the trans woman who got denied trying to change her legal gender so she took her top off in protest and got arrested for public indecency for displaying her breasts and then she was housed in a men's jail.
I understand this. I am both trans masc and in band, so I get it. I'm sorry. Also, no offense to your friend, but she needs to mind her own damn buisness.
My best friend is male, so I wished he had been there to yell at them (which he would have), but I  think he had already changed. I‚Äôve met a bunch of people from my new school and everyone seems wonderful, so I have high hopes that it‚Äôll be better.
[removed]
She‚Äôs done this before while just changing shirts, but there was only one other guy in the bathroom at the time so I could go into a stall. I talked to one of my other friends about it and she said she was going to tell her that wasn‚Äôt cool and she shouldn‚Äôt do it and make me uncomfortable
Awesome! Sounds like a true friend

My sibling (24, mtf) came out as trans, please help me be the best bigger sister I can be!	"Hi hello

My sibling came out as trans to me (27, f) two days ago, turns out I have a sister ü•∞ she struggled a lot opening up and I am so proud of her making that step. I really want to show her that I love her and support her fully, and want to be her ally and friend as much as she wants me to be through this process. 

I am wondering now - what are ways for me to support her other than being there for her and showing her my love? Anything you‚Äòve wished your sibling had done for you after coming out?

For example, yesterday I noticed in her bathroom that she has only skin care and personal hygiene products for men. What if I made her a little coming out gift basket with some products I like that I think fit her skin type, stuff she‚Äòs said that smells good and things that I think might make her feel more feminine? Do you think this is a good idea? I don‚Äòt want to do anything wrong. She still presents as a male so I don‚Äòt wanna overwhelm her. 

Thanks so much for any responses and much love :)


Edit: Wow, so many replies! Thank you all for taking the time to give me your insights and advice, it helped me understand her experience and my place in it better. I hope I can be supportive without being overwhelming ‚ô•Ô∏è"	"OMG you are the awesomest big sister, thank you for being so supportive of your li'l sis. 

What you suggested is lovely, also help her out with makeup and clothes sizing. Maybe take her shopping. 

As an only child who spent my lifetime longing for a sister you have totally made my day. ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
A little gift bag and some lessons sounds ideal. It's not so big to be intimidating but it's a big enough step that its affirming x
Take her shopping get her some makeup and gender affirming clothes, then maybe do an at home spa day and paint nails show her some makeup basics stuff like that.
You are already doing so great! She probably really just wants to be seen as herself, as a girl. I love the idea of getting her some feminine toiletries. You can buy or lend her clothes and jewelry too when she's ready.

Let her go at her own pace with how she presents and comes out to others but you can see her as a girl NOW because she is. That is so big, you don't even know. That's what she needs. You are already being a wonderful sister, just in how you're thinking about this.
If she's still presenting as male then skin care and personal hygiene products are a good place to start, because they're not as obvious to others but still allow for self-affirmation. The most important thing is to be ready to help her with things if she asks, but not to pressure her into doing anything she might not be comfortable yet.
Honestly what you're doing rn is already great.When I came out to my younger sister she used my correct name and pronouns and I felt seen and supported so i'm sure she does too.I think the gift basket idea would be cool.I'm ftm so take what you want with my advice but maybe if she's comfortable you could take her on a girls day or something and help her pick out make up and clothes if that's something she's interested in.At the end of the day just showing you love and support her just shows that you are the best older sister.Hope things go well for her during her transitionüíï
This post made me miss my big sister a lot.  We were really close, but she's gone.  She's not dead or anything, she's just openly fascist now so she's completely out of my life.  But she was really cool like 25 years ago.
[removed]
You rock. My sister and I didn't really get along when I still lived at home because I'm 9 years older than her. As we've both matured we've become closer but we still don't get to see each other often. When I came out to her last month she was fantastic, immediately a super strong supporter, and it really made me feel closer to her than I ever got to before.

All this to say that you loving and supporting your sister *already* makes you an amazing bigger sister, and I'm sure she already appreciates your support immensely. The best you can do is just normal big sister things, take her shopping, offer to help her learn makeup and figure out her style. Be there for her when it hurts, because it will, and as long as she has you to lean on it will never be as bad as it could be. 

Don't get *too* hard on yourself if you slip up. You thought she was your brother for 24 years, that's a *long* time and as much as you may love and support her she'll know you can't just flip a switch and be correct 100% of the time. There's a world of difference between a supporter making a legitimate mistake and trying to better themselves and an asshole that doesn't even try to get names/pronouns right.

This is going to be a tough journey for her but it looks like she already has some of the best help a girl can get. Keep being you and keep being awesome.
That gift bag is an amazing idea! I concur with a lot of the other girls in that teaching simple stuff is super helpful and affirming.
The small things really matter. The gift basket sounds amazing, but even small things like just calling her pretty will brighten her day. just knowing you‚Äôre there for her will be all she ever needs.

She‚Äôs so lucky to have a sister like you
Absolutely you should get her a coming out gift thing! That is such a cute idea. You should get her some things for like shaving, and hair care (personally recommend Dove Intensive Repair for trans girl hair. It can take a long time to grow out and if you fuck up maintaining your hair it can sort lf cover your tracks a little), maybe some skin care stuff and makeup. You could also help teach her how to use makeup too :3
Aww thank you, you just made my day too! ü•∫‚ù§Ô∏è I will definitely offer these things to her, maybe let her dive in my closet and do some clothes experimenting if she feels comfortable with that - I‚Äòll ask!
Thank you, that sounds great! Do you have any advice on how to frame offering lessons? :)
Thank you, this sounds really nice!
Why are you here?
You just made me cry. So lovely. ‚ù§
When you give her the basket, you can just say, ""If you'd like, I can show you some of the basics of doing makeup/skincare/etc, but if you'd like to experiment on your own that's fine too! If you ever need my help using this stuff, just ask."" That way, it's open ended, and she knows she can ask you for help if she needs it or just figure some stuff out on her own. She'll probably be trying to find what kind of style she wants, whether it's natural or more colorful, so it might be better for her to practice on her own.
My wife's approach to teaching me was very blunt so you could always go with that, lol x
Thank you for writing it out, that helps a lot! I think I will write her a little card saying exactly that and put it in the basket :)
Ahah everyone is different! I‚Äòm a very gentle and frankly socially awkward person so I‚Äòll probably take a more low key approach xD I‚Äòm glad you have your wife to support you!"	ocyn39	trans	141	1.0	2021-07-03 14:02:34

literally been crying	"So, bit of a vent:

ive been taking hrt for 7 months now ( Spironolactone & Estradiol), and yesterday was a breaking point. I was in the middle of working ( I am a barista) and we all know what spiro does to us X.x

my worst nightmare happened in front of what is a very busy coffee shop. Im incredibly humiliated and emotionally wrecked to say it, especially on such a public platform, but I had peed my pants (\*Sobs\*). and being trans, my dysphoria broke through the roof. it just flew so high it left earth. left work an hour early ( my manager had obvsly allowed it, she was very empathetic and I know she def cares for us as a team). cried in the bathroom for a good half hour getting my ish together and bought a new pair of jeans and boots at a marshalls down the street. 

Just, traumatic. Basically feeling dead today from yesterday."	"In the nicest possible way , girls often pee them self‚Äôs from sneezing or laughing hard and so on

I'm so sorry that happened to you, the same thing happened to me once in my old food production line job, they don't give you a single chance relieve yourself and when I had an accident I was fired. Glad to hear your boss was empathetic but I understand how embarrassing it can be :( hope you're feeling better today or at least in a better headspace x
Sorry that happened to you. :-(

That seems like it would be an upsetting experience.

Hope you can get some rest and start to feel better.
That‚Äôs sounds horrible, I‚Äôm sorry that happened to you. Hope you can take some time to rest and recuperate.
I cannot even imagine that, I'm so sorry that happened - I get uncomfortable & humiliated even just needing the bathroom in public, I would die if that happened to me.üíîüíî sending all the love your way.
I'm so, so sorry that happened to you. Take a few days to breathe, recollect yourself, and cuddle a bunch of stuffed animals/a pet if you have one. It's going to be easier, you're going to be okay. <33
Wait, does does Spiro make you pee more?
Tell your doctor/Endo to prescribe you a blocker that's not Spiro lol that shit sucks
Oh my gosh, I cannot imagine what thats like.
Yes! Spiro causes the kidneys to keep on extracting fluids, meaning you pee more often.

I did, too.  Was about to mention when 8 security stopped me inna San Francisco mall, even putting hands on me in front of dozens who stopped to watch   The one that touched me got his ass fired.  The others had to go through ""retraining"".

Gosh, I am so happy it was a happy story!

That inly happened to me once(following behind someone into the men's room,.  I was looking down at legs and wasn't paying attention.  Same mall, 5 years later!  hahaha!  And Now, they have an open floor plan single facility with a row of sinks dividing women and men sections, lol.

‚ÄúJust wait until you have kids‚Äù üòû	"So I‚Äôm a trans girl (14 months hrt) who works at a grocery store. There was a customer with a twin baby stroller talking to me about her kids today and it was pleasant until the end of our conversation.
She said ‚Äúoh just wait until you have kids of your own‚Äù
She doesn‚Äôt realize I‚Äôm trans and pregnancy isn‚Äôt an option for me. I cried for a bit in the bathroom realizing I‚Äôll never get that motherly experience.

How do you even respond to that? üòû"	"On the upside, she thought that you were completely CIS and therefore looking at a future that included kids. From her side a simple statement not meant to cause any harm.
adoption changes your brain in the same way that having biological kids does, afaik. you can absolutely experience everything except the pregnancy process, which by all accounts is very uncomfortable and painful
Tell her that you are infertile.
I mean at least she thinks you can get pregnant. 

Maybe the customers can manifest this seemingly impossible feat with the power of consumerism and corporate greed! /s

I agree though: it stings when I see pregnant women. I just wish I had a proper hormone balance mostly. Like all the little changes a cis body makes throughout pregnancy is what I'd want. 

I dont really want to have kids tho so I feel for you. It must be tough especially when talking to mothers.
Just something to note. I‚Äôm a trans woman and I do have three children. One of which is a foster child . I plan on adopting another child at some point. 

Yeah you know I‚Äôd give anything to get pregnant. Especially now that I found the guy I‚Äôm going to spend my life with. I‚Äôd love to carry his baby. It‚Äôs honestly been hard. 

That said, I know my aunt couldn‚Äôt get pregnant. My cousins are adopted. They are wonderful. You can still have children. Honestly I love my foster child just as much as my two bio daughters. They are all my world. I‚Äôm sure when my boyfriend and I adopt our own child I‚Äôll love that baby just as much too. 

*hugs*
My biggest pain too ü•∫üò≠
You cam addopt
We have all gone through so much hardship and adversity, yet the casual mention of bearing a child breaks us into a million pieces. My cat is my sun, my moon and the closest thing to a child in my eyes.
There isn‚Äôt one singular motherly experience and if you get kids you‚Äôll have a motherly experience no matter what way you got the kid(s) (though yeah it would be nice if everyone got to have the one they wanted)
Well, on the upside you're very young which means that if the world survives the next 10-15 years, you may be in the position to actually get an artificial uterus or transplant. So, I mean, it's a possibility
Well i cried and cry over the fact that i will not be able to get pregnant. Though my boyfriend says we can adopt child, i don't want that.
U can still be a mother and have kids not all cis women can get pregnant
There are a thousand ways to be a mother. Being pregnant is only one of them.
I felt the same when my History teacher told me that i would never be able to carry a functioning womb, but my girlfriend knows that I really want to raise a daughter, so she'll carry the baby. But it is hard to realise that.
Hey I hope you know that the interaction you just describes is something that a lot of cis women who are infertile experience. That doesn‚Äôt make it less painful for you but I hope you know you aren‚Äôt alone. That‚Äôs really tough I‚Äôm sorry.
How‚Äôs that the fault of the woman? She correctly gendered you.
This is legitimately the only reason I was born cis. Everything else about being trans I completely manageable, but this is the only thing that makes me so depressed about being trans. Much love‚ù§Ô∏è
Yk you can adopt. You can still breastfeed. Women aren‚Äôt just incubators they‚Äôre so much more I know how it hurts to know some women can do that but you can‚Äôt but I promise you‚Äôre still able to do so much
adoption is probably better anyway, helping kids in need. and look on the bright side, u pas so well she thought u were cis
Crying is a good response imo, its a healthy outlet for all those feelings. While it may never hold a candle to having a child and watching them grow, Ive found having pets can be very comforting. They depend on us to feed and care for them so in a sense it helps bring slight comfort to the inner mother in me. My partner doesnt want kids at all, but adoption is very much an option as well, and one I hope to take part in someday.
Find and be with a man who has children already ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I know that sadness too üòî
I‚Äôve have two beautiful daughters. They both  have been the lights of my life. Neither of these young lady‚Äôs are my biological Children and U couldn‚Äôt care less. These girls are my girl‚Äôs.
As a mum all I can say is you can still 100% experience motherhood with adoption.
I mourned being barren like any other woman who is barren would mourn not being able to conceive.
This is something I've seen cis women experience as well on account of being unable to carry a pregnancy or become pregnant. I'm glad I never want to be pregnant (since I'm AMAB, I never would have been anyways) but I'm very sorry for people who want to be and can't.
I wish I had the option of pregnancy at all though. I likely will adopt in the future when I‚Äôm financially stable
totally understandable wanting to give birth to your child, but i‚Äôll say, i was adopted as a teenager and it absolutely saved my life. adoption is incredible and definitely worth considering.
Is there a reason you don‚Äôt want to adopt? I have two bio daughters and a foster daughter (plan to finalize her adoption after my divorce is final). I‚Äôll say I love them all the same. Like yeah I missed my foster daughter‚Äôs first few years but like we all of her life together now. 

That said now that I‚Äôm with my boyfriend and we plan to get married we do want to adopt a baby one day. I‚Äôm sure I‚Äôll love that kid just as much. 

I get it though. It‚Äôs hard. I‚Äôd trade anything to get pregnant and carry his child. He‚Äôs the kindest man I‚Äôve ever met and one of the smartest.
It‚Äôs not, I‚Äôm talking about my own sadness not being able to conceive.
that's fair
Fostering is another option. I only did it because I took in one of my students. But it is an option. A lot of 5-8 year olds need homes.
ƒ∞t may be, but i am not ready for such things, if i feel like that in the future too, then i cannot adopt a child.
ƒ∞ don't think i am ready for it or will be ready for soon. ƒ∞ don't want to have a bad impact on a child before I'm %100 sure.
i gotcha. good luck with everything <3
Oh I get. For sure you need to be ready. My first child was not planned and I wonder if we were ready back then. But she‚Äôs turned out amazing.
Thank you dear
ƒ∞ am happy for you :). Adoption of a child could be really good but... ƒ∞ really wish i was able to give birth to:(
I get it. I did awful through both of my exes pregnancies and couldn‚Äôt figure out why. It was really hard and I was depressed and angry. I had no idea why. I wish I could fix it though because I know it made the pregnancies hard for my exes. But I understand. I do.
ƒ∞ ask this because i am really curious, are you cis or trans?

Help	"I was reading through the Dysphoria Bible again, hadn't looked at it since my egg cracked. There was a Twitter post in there that was a trans woman's personal experience with dysphoria. It hit way too close to home, like all of it. 


    But the part that said, ""You often feel directionless in life. When asked about career goals in High School, you didn't really care about your answer. Even careers centered in your interests seemed kind of intolerable. You struggle to imagine a future for yourself where you are happy or fulfilled.

     And, ""You only take steps to better your life when external forces *make* you. You'd rather withdraw and self-minimize and focus on escapist hobbies. You're just not motivated to attain nice things for yourself. (You tell yourself that this is a zen acceptance, a freedom from desires.)""

That's literally me right now. I'm at a point when I HAVE to do something, I have to figure so much stuff out, and I have no motivation. The only motivation I have is to get out of my parents place, but what do I do? I know everyone feels pressured to have a plan, and you don't necessarily have to, but I'm absolutely terrified of rushing out into the world unprepared. 

I just.... I'm so overwhelmed and pressured to do.. SOMETHING, but I can't bring myself to do much outside of the regular, go to work, eat, and sleep... Alot.  I can't even muster much motivation for things I normally LOVE, like art or reading.

And my dysphoria is killing me, I'm finding myself in a place mentally I never thought I would be. I'm crying in my bathroom as I type this

I'm terrified it's not going to get better, that I'm always gonna be stuck, unhappy, never doing anything, never BEING anything worth it. 

I just... I'm lost, I'm hoping desperately it will get better, but idk


**Edit**

I was having a really rough night, I've been trying to cope, to find my way through this, and thus far failing miserably. I haven't been doing the best mentally, but I'm gonna keep going. Thank you, all of you (minus the guy who told me to kill myself, he can f*** off)."	"I feel the same. I always felt the same. Because i always lived my life for the people around me.

This is not a solution, but i only got to live a normal adult life because my partners and friends pushed me into the right direction. 

If you are like me, then believing you are doing it for someone else is all you need. Of course you can't just decide to tell this to yourself and believe it. Surround yourself with friends and try to help them to move out of their house by working towards being a good roommate. Its much easier to fight for someone else than for yourself
I feel the same. I did pick up university because it seemed the easiest, picked computer science because it's the only one that sounds mildly interesting because I had to do something. I still don't think it'll lead me anywhere right now but then again Im only a bit into my transition, pre everything not out to most of my non friends social life.
What's interesting though, but that might be other factors, around when I accepted myself internally as trans I started university back up after a several year hiatus paying but not doing anything and also got more other productive things like cleaning done and more regularly.
I also feel the same.
A little bit at a time, every day. You might have to force yourself, and sometimes you most certainly will have to force yourself. Make your bed when you wake up, fold that laundry right away, wash your sheets every two weeks. Maintain and do a little bit that works towards your goals, even if its for five minutes. 

Somedays all we can do is lay in bed, that's okay, let yourself be guilt free while doing this. Let yourself recharge. It will give you the space to be you in your own space, and you will begin feeling those desires stirring in you, the desire towards action. Follow those! Even if it seems like the hardest thing in the world.
Same here, mate. Here‚Äôs to hoping we‚Äôll at least partially get through it."	uc6nlj	trans	122	0.97	2022-04-26 07:02:57
Thought I'd try my luck as a trans girl in the guys Bathroom and practically got dragged out.	"Ok so I was going out last night and the queues for the girls bathroom were sooooo long, and the guys bathroom was practically empty so I figured I'd try my luck in there.

The bathroom attendant guy kinda freaked out and was like ""This is the mens bathroom!"" So I ducked past him and went into an empty stall (they were all empty)  I'm closing the stalls door he jams his foot in it and tells me I have to leave. And I'm like ""OMG I'm already in the stall let me pee"" But he wont let me close the door. 

And then this really big bouncer comes in, and there both standing there at the stall like ""You need to go to the WOMENS bathroom NOW!"" 

And the only guy actually using the bathroom who is at the urinals shouts ""Ah sure let her stay shes already in there"" 

Considering the bathroom panic stuff going on I found the whole situation kind of funny, but also I'm pretty small and the attendant and bouncer were REALLY big and being kind of agressive. 

So I concede defeat, and they escort me out. And I have to queue for like 30 minutes outside the girls bathroom.

&#x200B;

But yeah, I guess the moral of the story is that people take gender policing WAY to seriously. And y'all just need to let us pee in peace xD"	"Omg sounds as validating as it sounds terrifying haha.
Lol üòÇ
Haha FtM here. I almost got myself arrested twice and punched out once cuz of this. It's all cuz of my damn voice - I passed just fine until someone notices me chatting with a friend outside. They take keeping women out of men's restrooms very seriously (especially since it is illegal where I am)
Walk in on me and I will probably take you in a stall & have You for a snack or main course
I'm so sorry this happened to you. I'm so sick of these disgusting transphobic white males.
That seems strange. I‚Äôm used to it being the other way around....
Sry but this sounds like what a right winger thinks trans people say online üòÜ
Wow... Thanks for just dismissing my opinions...
For the record neither the attendant or the bouncer were white. Also yeah, white male entitled and phobic dickheads are really common.

And things like white privelege and institutionalised transphobia and racism are baked into our society.

But waving ""Transphobic white males"" around like a catch all thing doesn't really work or even apply sometimes.

I want to tear down this rotten system, not get super focused on the few who gain from the system and act like dickheads as a result."	bymejh	trans	122	0.99	2019-06-09 17:05:33

Your pre adult life is very short and it will get better I promise you. If your parents won‚Äôt support you the moment you turn 18 you can start looking at hormone replacement therapy if that‚Äôs something you are interested in. I understand how you feel trust me a lot of us really do. Life will get better and if you ever pursue testosterone it can undo some of the things your first puberty changed about your body.
Idk if you did it already but you could cut your hair

Hi Jamie! I know it probably feels like hell right now. I hope you can believe, even if only a little, that it will get better, and you will get access to Hormone Replacement Treatment.

Have you talked to your parents about being trans? Do you believe they might understand and support you? 

We are here for you, including talking to your parents here on reddit if that might be an option, or showing studies about HRT on kids and teenagers.

You are not alone. It is easier now to get access to HRT than it has ever been on the history of humanity. Also, where do you live? Hope you can get the help you need soon. Oh, a therapist might also help! Good luck, dear boy üíñ

Hi,  I go by Patricia 16 MtF and I feel ya.   I'm a sophomore in High School and I can help you get through Junior High/Middle school if you need it.   I certainly wished I had someone to help me then.  PM me if you need anything.  Also I'm an Engineering Student so if you need help with math or science well lets just say that there was a reason related to that that I was bullied for.  Still I love to help.
I'm probably going to get downvoted but it's probably not a great idea for a 13-year-old to self-dose hormones. If a doctor is willing to prescribe them, great! (Though at this age I think puberty blockers are more likely). But I *really* don't think he should be taking unsupervised. To be clear, I'm not saying he's too young to know or whatever, I'm saying he's too young to be giving himself a substance that could potentially have bad effects if it's done wrong. 

Also don't forget that unlike estrogen, testosterone is a controlled substance in most places, so it's much more difficult if not downright illegal to DIY in most places.
No need for a downvote I have parents in the healthcare industry and there not transphobic just opposed to the Idea of self-medicating  when there are other options. Simply from a safety standpoint not that they don't agree with transgender people just they don't want people to hurt themselves by self medicating."	nljg5p	trans	123	0.99	2021-05-26 15:15:53
It takes so little to ruin a positive mood.	Today was going really well, I have slowly been telling friends and family that I am trans. So far everyone has been amazingly supportive, using the proper pronouns and calling me by my newly chosen name. This morning I was in such a positive state of mind that I was tempted to tell my parents. It really felt like everything would be ok. Then while texting one of my closest friends about our determination to lose weight, she said ‚Äúwe have to be good girls in the new year‚Äù. It was the casual use of girls that made me so happy. The deep conversations about acceptance are so nice, but the off hand casual references just make me smile every time. So, all in all today was going well. Then I caught my reflection in the bathroom mirror while shirtless, and that‚Äôs all it took. Every flaw, every stretch mark, everything that makes me hate this body jumped out. Every bit of excitement about the new year was gone. That negative voice in my head was saying why bother. You‚Äôll never pass, be feminine or be even slightly attractive.	"Hang it there girlfriend. It will get better. It takes time. Keep going! Try to focus on the positive it sounds like you have a great support structure. Take the positivity from that! Have a safe and Happy and healthy new year and new YOU!!
Hey girl. You *are* a girl! Your femininity is not defined by your appearance. Stretch marks aren't masculine! I am cis and I have stretch marks. Big tiger stripes all over my bum and thighs because I gained and lost weight really fast. I don't know if any of that helps, but please don't feel like you're not valid!
Well, i have a message for that little voice. 

This person is a beautiful woman, she may look ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù as society might refer to her but she is a woman nonetheless. She is a amazing, adorable, sweet, gorgeous girl. And nothing can change that, and she will only get prettier as she feels more herself in her body. And when she is the same on the outside as her mind, we will all see that she is even more amazing than we thought. 

Now dont let that voice get to you, we all have it, sometimes it gets to us. We just have to tell it to shush and remind ourselves that we are amazing and beautiful, or in my case handsome lol. Happy new year, It will get better as time passes honey, dont worry.
But don‚Äôt forget to be excited about how much progress you‚Äôll make this year!!
I've dealt with dysphoria and boy does it suck. I don't know how your experience is like since it's different for everyone but I'm here for you! There are always thing to look forward to. Maybe you can mention to your parents to get some stuff to help ease the dysphoria?
Thank you. With support from friends and family, as well kind words from people here, I‚Äôm hoping the negative thoughts lose their strength.
Thank you, it helps alright. I worry about everything really, but the stretch marks I‚Äôm mainly worried about start nearly under arm and cross my chest. I‚Äôd hate to finally get breasts only for them to look bad. I know I shouldn‚Äôt let myself get bogged down by appearance, but at the same time I feel I need every edge I can get
Thank you for the wonderful words, they really mean a lot. I hope you have an amazing 2022

why do people think we're overly sensitive	"I woke up this morning and my ears had closed.
I went into the bathroom to push an earring through, and my mom asked what I was doing, so I told her

Then she said ""if you just let them close you won't have that problem you know""

She hated my ears being pierced, and my hair being long, the way I dress, my nails being painted, everything, so I said, ""you don't have to make comments about the way I look"" the way she said it was very ""I wish you'd let them close""

She makes little digs and comments all the time, and they build up. She got mad and said I'm sensitive and I shouldn't expect to dress the way I do without getting comments.

My dad starts taking her side and I told her, all I said was to not make comments about my appearance.

She said, ""you're just insecure about how you look, and you're projecting it on us.

That put me over the edge, because I'm a lot of things, but I'm not insecure about my appearance, I wear what I want, dress how I like, and would paint my nails, but I'm literally being forced to not paint them, because it embarrasses them.

I yelled ""let's be real here, you, are insecure about the way I look, not me, you told me I embarrass you, and that I look like a f*got, you said I'm pushing you away because you don't want to be seen with a gay looking son, you're the insecure ones, not me, I'd actually look the way I wanted if I didn't live with you.""

She just laughed

She was quiet for a minute, and then laughed, like, loud, and it just pissed me off so much.

I wanted to say, the second I move out of here, I'm gone.

The initial comment may seem small, but she says shit about how my hair looks bad all the time, and how I look gay, and tells me family members don't want to talk to me because of it.

At one point I told her, maybe if the don't want to talk to me over something so superficial, I don't want to talk to them either.

That of course just made her fly into talking about how my generation is so sensitive and whiny and we just wanna push our agenda.

The irony of course being she was whining and bitching over long hair and painted nails, while simultaneously pushing her agendaüôÑ"	"Because they're dumb bigots who need to vacate the planet asap.
I hope you don't mind me saying this, but your mom sounds like an asshole.
Because they're bigots and assholes who see our issues and problems as made up or petty so they think we're ridiculous for caring about them at all. Or it's a way to intentionally try to gaslight us into thinking our problems aren't important or worth listening to, so we stop bringing it up because it makes _them_ uncomfortable. Just like it's her projecting her issues with your appearance onto you, Usually they are the ones being overly sensitive and getting upset by us politely correcting them, but then they turn it around on us by blowing up about how sensitive we are and how dare u say anything about this at all.
Funny how she said you‚Äôre projecting, because as you said, you‚Äôre quite secure about how you want to look, and it‚Äôs their insecurity THEY are projecting on YOU.
you deserve better parents, I'm sorry you got stuck with such garbage people. You're better than them in every way, and don't let their comments make you think otherwise. The most vile of people like to make everyone who is different seem like the devil incarnate when really they are the one's who are horrible inside, and to face that reality would well and truly break their small and fragile minds. I would cut all contact with them as soon as you possibly can within reason, because they don't even deserve to breathe the same air as you.
Tell her to bite rocks and move on. Lost cause there it sounds like
going through the same thing and they do it because they can understand us‚Ä¶ and maybe they don‚Äôt want to‚Ä¶ my only advice is get out of there as soon as possible‚Ä¶ best wishes!
Because they will say anything to try to invalidate us!
What a lot of the older generations see as sensitivity is in reality just us having a backbone. Standing up for one's self isn't sensitivity, but getting all triggered over the way someone presents? Honey that wouldn't make someone a snowflake, it'd make them the whole fucking winter season.
Because media and politics often attack us with cherry picked info pushing that narrative.
Because they are ignorant, willfully or otherwise
my parents are the same! well my mom anyway. 

i dress punk (have since high school), piercings dyed hair ripped clothes platforms the whole 9. 

she likes to think that because i choose to dress outside of societal norms im not allowed to complain when people treat me like i‚Äôm an animal. 

it‚Äôs only gotten worse since i‚Äôve been presenting more and more how i want to but i‚Äôm still closeted from her and my dad.
no because she is insecure, probably stuck in her shitty marriage and feels constricted to all fuck, if anything she's projecting onto you, stay strong and stay beautiful.
Some people are overly sensitive, especially this community. Every other post on here is a vent, asking for advice, vent vent vent, asking for advice, vent again.
I honestly think this is an ""old people"" issue, they're always making snarky comments about people and are always running their mouths but when we do reply to them in the same tone they talked to us they get defensive or angry and sometimes even cry (I've seen it happen with my own eyes... lmao) I just don't understand that, if you can't stand the weight of your own words why would you say them to someone else? It's confusing.

As for advice, I'd just tell you to ""ignore"" your parents comments and try to move out ASAP (I know it's not easy to just ignore, but I'm assuming in the moment, you don't have a choice.)
I mean you just said what we were all thinking
She has zero self awareness.. it‚Äôs almost maddening
Funny, is not the word I'd use.
Jesus fuck, you hit the nail on the headüíÄ
Yeah, bc we aren't allowed to vent irl, bc we get called all sorts of names, and get told how whiny our generation is, so when you get a high concentration of people who aren't allowed to complain, of course there's gonna be a lot of venting posts, doesn't mean we're any more whiny than anyone else.
Sure, ‚Äúcurious‚Äù could work well, as in ‚ÄúCurious how she said‚Ä¶‚Äù
i tend to do that, dont let her try to invalidate how you feel, your emotions are extremely valid and if she wants to harm her  relationship with you over stitches and fabric and pigmented nail liquid then that's her problem, her fault, and shows how damaged as a human being she is. you're strong and deserve to feel validated, and im sorry that you can't be shown that at home but you're extremely valid, supported and loved, if she can't see past materialistic value in these items she doesn't deserve to make your brain feel less than or that her opinions are truth
Oh she's not making me feel invalid, it's just that

The hypocrisy is palpable

hun, everything you've said she said invalidated you as a trans individual

I feel like the bad guy sometimes	"I believe that all trans women should be able to use the woman's bathroom, and vice versa for trans men, but it makes me feel like the bad guy for thinking that way.

I can't just tell girls that are uncomfortable with me, a 16 year old MtF in the ladies room that they are wrong for thinking that way, I can't really say anything to that, I just have to accept the fact that I will have to use the men's bathroom forever"	"I was such a bad guy I became a good girl
You don't have to use the men's forever. You can always just express you mean no harm and neither do most trans people. I think most people will come around eventually.
I'm a cis women and I don't care if a trans woman uses the girls bathroom. Because we're all women anyway!!! 

But I believe there should be unisex bathrooms everywhere though. It would be simpler...
Lol ""forever"" is a very extreme conclusion to come to and the exact thing ppl make fun of teenagers for. 

Bathroom use will change with time and context. You will change with time and context. Make sure that your time is put to good use in making the context optimal.
I had an epiphany and stopped feeling bad when I pissed in a coffee cup so I wouldn't have to decide which public bathroom to use in a Planet Fitness. You've done nothing wrong. Do what you gotta do to survive.
Cis people will always be uncomfortable with us. It doesn‚Äôt matter what we do. If you live your life trying to avoid making anyone uncomfortable you‚Äôll never leave the house.
Do you present female?
I‚Äôm with you, honestly. Even if I know that trans women should be allowed in the women‚Äôs bathroom, I wouldn‚Äôt do it myself, because I don‚Äôt feel comfortable in women‚Äôs spaces knowing that I may make other women uncomfortable. I can‚Äôt just think, oh well, they‚Äôre bigoted - even when they might be, they‚Äôre people, and I don‚Äôt want to put myself and others in an uncomfortable situation. The perspective of the transfeminist activist and the movement as a whole differs from what feels comfortable in practice for many trans people - not everyone wants to be challenging conventions and pushing boundaries all the time. Sometimes we just want to live without garnering much attention. I sympathize with your plight, but you should also know that you aren‚Äôt ‚Äúthe bad guy‚Äù for using the women‚Äôs restroom, and you shouldn‚Äôt let transphobia make you feel that way.
We are talking about toilets right? There are gender neutral toilets in the world and they work, where both women and men and nbs go. So what is the problem?

In my experience people don't give a shit if you don't. If you look like you know you are supposed to be there they won't really bother you. Of course this isn't true for everything.

Edit:
You wouldn't be able to use the women's bathroom even when you pass better?
How would people know you're trans?
You are just using the bathroom, you're not hurting anyone right?
No you can absolutely tell them they are wrong. In fact majority of Cis women in my interaction don‚Äôt care and I don‚Äôt pass much if at all.
I mean, while we don't know your situation, if you're not in the position to present as female you probably shouldn't be using the women's restroom, tbh. Same logic goes for trans men. Of course people are going to be uncomfortable if someone's in there that appears to be not the same gender as they are. Not meaning this in a rude way, of course you could be presenting as female and them being uncomfortable would just be weird, but if you're not, yeah you should probably keep it in mind y'know.
I only use the unisex bathroom.
Im ftm and i get harassed in the bathroom a lot because i feel like i dont pass well enough to use the mens, but women definitely dont like me in their bathroom anymore. 

And like, especially at work like... what's everyone gonna do when im 5-6 years into my transition and have actual facial hair and pass better? The women definitely wont want me in there, but what about all the men who've seen me using the women's room for the past few years?

I definitely feel where youre coming from
I‚Äôve gone the stupid approach and haven‚Äôt used a public bathroom for around 3 years, even the ones at my school ( this is not a suggestion btw )
As more normal you act as more they response most of the time.... ( I know it is hard sometimes to Cover how hurtful that can be )

But honestly I Think thats the way a few can be reached....
Here's what a few hundred national- and state-level women's DV and SA orgs have to say on the matter:

[http://www.4vawa.org/ntf-action-alerts-and-news/2018/4/12/national-consensus-statement-of-anti-sexual-assault-and-domestic-violence-organizations-in-support-of-full-and-equal-access-for-the-transgender-community](http://www.4vawa.org/ntf-action-alerts-and-news/2018/4/12/national-consensus-statement-of-anti-sexual-assault-and-domestic-violence-organizations-in-support-of-full-and-equal-access-for-the-transgender-community)

Just do what everyone else does - go in, have a pee, wash your hands and leave. Beings trans is a 1000 acts of overcoming.
I can promise you that your are over thinking it. As long as you are presenting female, the vast majority of people will not think twice. Just don't go in full cis male mode and expect people not to react.
Fuck that. I feel way less uncomfortable and unsafe using the ladies‚Äô. I‚Äôll take a Karen with a ‚Äúwe the people‚Äù tat glaring over a fat redneck blocking the exit any day. (Both things I‚Äôve experienced) be safe.
My whole life people told me I was a bad guy, bad boy, needed to work on being a good guy. Too much effort, who cares what anyone else thinks, just be you. They‚Äôre uncomfortable because they‚Äôre told they‚Äôre supposed to be that way from society. I highly recommend working with team of female athletes, the entire team will get to know you and you‚Äôll have an entire team become a safe place. I went to a super conservative school and I think almost the entire team were from conservative families and they still called me one of the girls and invited me to girl nights. I was presenting male then too.   Just don‚Äôt date anyone on the team no matter what. Strict rule. Bot worth it. It‚Äôs not worth potentially losing an entire group of friends and support for a crush that might become something, might not.

Edit: grammar
I hope to some day get confident enough to use ladies washroom but till then, I will use outhouses or unisex washrooms.
With how things are going rn, I'm not too confident about the future
So true
I mean, never leaving the house does seem like an attractive prospect some days tbf

So the mens restroom‚Ä¶..	So I‚Äôm FTM and I just used the mens bathroom and it was‚Ä¶.well not bad but the womens restroom is better in my opinion. I made eye contact with an employee who was coming in and I got nervous since I‚Äôm pre everything but he just walked pastüòé guess I pass enough but I think I‚Äôll stick to the woman‚Äôs restroom üíÄ	"MTF and yes, the men‚Äôs restroom is disgusting. Welcome.
I hate all public restrooms equally lol
Yeah idk why men are like that and never have.
Egg here and yeah, mens bathroom a really disgusting. I would really love to use the woman's one more often
Guys are gross, but girls are not that much better either. Just use the one that's empty of humans. Girls also have bodily functions.
The men‚Äôs restroom is always gross compared to the ladies wherever you go 

I have no idea why
I just don't use public bathrooms
I dunno the women's in khaos bar was something else near then end of pride üòÇ 

At least I found acceptance as a cubicle door lock being 5'10 so I could reach over and hold the door shut for my freinds and a couple randomers who asked for help after the locks all broke üòÜ
Yep the mens is gross and I avoid it whenever possible lol
MTF, I think the quality of the public restroom really depends on where it is. My retail job - garbage never used it unless I was about to burst. My two office jobs - they were great at one I wasn‚Äôt out yet so used the men‚Äôs, at the other I had started transitioning and it was lovely. Other Office women brought in nice soaps and lotions and I had actually bathroom conversation! (So proud of myself lol) current job in a hotel, the guest bathrooms are nice, employee one, well we have been out of hand soap for a week and a half so‚Ä¶

Regardless, I still prefer to handle my business alone.
Transfemme here. Yeah, I don't miss the mens room. I'll stand in line for the ladies every single time if it means not having piss on the floor.
as a man ƒ± wish ƒ± could upgrade into womens restroom man restroom are piss cigarate butts and snot most of the time
I haven't entered a public restroom in 2 years, but I doubt that they have improved.
Ha, now you get a taste of what being a real man is like. Welcome to the club! You get to wach ice break, and go into wierd bathrooms. Also you get called a homie by all your friends. :)
The only difference i have noticed is the lack of urine on the seats in the womans room.. also being able to dispose of panty liners properly is great for the womans.

It's great that we have protections on expression now in my country and it's spreading - so just about anyone can be themselves  and use whatever washroom is safest or better suited.
Honestly? If you aren't taking the opportunity away from someone, don't be afraid to use the family washroom or disabled washroom. Obviously don't cut off someone to use it first or sit there on your phone, but you don't have to use the women's room if it makes you dysphoric.

When I first started breaking my cis habits, I'd use the handicapped washroom if it was available. Sometimes I didn't have the stomach for the weirdly too hot and piss smelling men's room. Now I'm sorta getting used to it the more I use it, I just can't get over the way it smells so much worse ü§¢ü§¢
Downside to the ladies toilets is the queues on a night out. But much cleaner in my experiences anyway..
Mens restrooms commonly have at least one door that does not work properly ü§¶üèΩ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
You people use restrooms?
I‚Äôm mtf but I‚Äôm still using the mens rooms cause I‚Äôm worried bout family stuff and yeah it‚Äôs pretty dang nasty
Tbh, in my experience, I've noticed that women's restrooms are usually worse, purely because men tend to use stalls less compared to urinals. I've found way too many bodily fluids on toilet seats in women's restrooms when usually the male stalls are fairly sanitary and usually unused if they're regularly cleaned.
This, as someone who has had to clean both, we are all disgusting.
Wait, how can you be an egg and know you're an egg? You've created a tear in the space time continuum.
I'm a girl and my body doesn't function
Yeah I didn‚Äôt want to say how it smells‚Ä¶.but you‚Äôre so rightüò≠ it‚Äôs very very stinky
Yeah I noticed thatüíÄ I spent like 5 minutes trying to lock the door
My experience with stalls in the men's toilets is that they're usually in either a state of unuse since the cleaners came through, or they're utterly destroyed and unusable.
In my experience mens restrooms smell like piss and there‚Äôs piss everywhere. Maybe the stalls are cleaner though, idk
I won't destroy it the space, I just get called egg all the time and I don't really know If I am trans or faking it
Maybe I wanted to create said tear
To be fair, you can be uncertain or hesitant but still be aware you're questioning. I went for like a year, most of it on HRT, before I could confidently say I was trans. Did my egg crack at the beginning of that, or the end?
All it takes is one dude to fuck up a toilet till the next cleaning. Cleaning crews are truly the backbone of society.
I still wast very sure I was trans when I created this account but I'm pretty sure I am now, but I still feel a little uncertain"	w04jyx	trans	117	0.97	2022-07-16 01:23:43
MTF went out to eat at a restaurant in full girl mode and used a women‚Äôs public bathroom today!	A day full of firsts, went out to dinner as a girl felt ok because I was 2 hours away from where I live so I knew no one e would recognize me and either no one noticed or they didn‚Äôt care, I doubt I pass at this point. Then as a I kept driving I really had to pee so I pulled into a rest stop and used the women‚Äôs bathroom, my heart was racing a little but afterwards I felt so good!	"I hate that we feel like we have to go somewhere else to be who we are, so we don‚Äôt get recognized or whatever. I tell myself often ‚ÄúFuck what they think‚Äù like when I do my makeup to go to the local grocery store. So, good for you taking these important steps for yourself!
It really is a special kind of kick. I'm happy it went well for you :) My first visit to the women's bathroom was at the mall I work. Helped a little that it was a familiar place.
Awesome happy for ya!

BATHROOM WIN	"I needed to use the restroom so I asked a guy where it was. The girls restroom is on the far side, the boys restroom is on the near side of where I was. 

The guy pointed me towards the mens restroom. I was so happy. There were other guys in there so I didn‚Äôt use the restroom but I came in to just wash my hands. Too scared to use a toilet."	"Weeeeeee! Awesome, good for you. Dunno if you noticed that, but guys in public washrooms rarely look at each other. You should totally go into a stall next time even to just lock it and sit for a couple minutes.
WHOOOO
This is 100% true, I'm mtf but haven't transitioned yet and it's something even I've done. If the stalls are occupied but urinals are open just stand off to the side and it'll tell others right away you're first in line for the stall"	wbdwpk	trans	112	0.95	2022-07-29 19:46:01

Cis dude, about to be pissed at gendered toilets	WHY in the motherfucking fuck are tgey divided by GENDER?! How come I seem to be the only one who thinks they should be devided by whether you wanna sit down or be objectively wrong?! Men's rooms SUCK because there's like half of them stalls and one wall full of urinals. I hate it! Why not make to huge restrooms, one for people with gross wet shoes who wanna stand in a pisspuddle and one for normal people?! HOW IS THIS SUCH A HARD CONCEPT TO GRASP! Fuck everyone still demanding gendered bathrooms	"I want bathrooms like they have in Japan where everybody gets a private room to do their business in.
*People are paranoid predators are going to spy on them while they shit*

That‚Äôs the only reason and it‚Äôs so flawed in more ways than one. 

You know, the wide majority of people who use public bathrooms just want to use the bathroom. I‚Äôm on your side. It‚Äôs never made sense to me. I haven‚Äôt used a public bathroom in two years.
My wife never understood why I hated taking my daughter to the men's room when she was little.  I finally  explained to her that the only people who use the stalls are men who have diarrhea and little kids who can't aim or lift the seat.

After being thoroughly grossed out, we did not have that argument again.  I have had a few opportunities to use the ladies room where it is allowed after coming out as trans.  It is so clean!  There is no comparison.

Men need to learn bathroom etiquette.  No matter where they pee.
Am I alone in refusing to use public bathrooms? Like they're never clean and almost always some creepy guy is just hanging out like bro, go way XD
Im a cis girl and I would never sit on a public toilet, you gotta fly a bit above it or put toilet paper where you want to sit so you potentially don‚Äôt get some hiv ü§£ü§£ü§£ü§£ and trust me girls toilets are nasty, either you see some period blood, pee everywhere coz girls have bad aim... and lines... we always have longer lines. So to sum it up, both ways are fucked, best is to pee in the forest. üòÇüíî
As a cis dude I hate urinals with all my heart. I would much rather squat over the toilet seat than piss in a urinal, those things are nasty.  
Just give everyone toilets and remove gendered bathrooms.
Just wanted to give a general thanks for being on our side!   Way too much hate out there, and not enough acceptance.
LMFAO! üò∏  Yeah.  I was *never* able to use urinals.  I never saw the point. ü§∑
They know that they canndo that already right? 

Yea. Also urinals are gross and there's always a piss puddle

Almost got sort of outed by a joke at work just now	"My training officer where I volunteer and I were just chilling and talking shit while we werent busy, then this woman comes out of the bathroom and says they're out of paper towels, my boss turns to me and says ""hey you're transgender right you can go change the roll out"" and I just sit there totally deer in headlights for like a full few seconds (I'm not remotely out or trying to be feminine at work, or out in general...)  before another volunteer who is a girl comes over and goes to change them.   My smartwatch says my pulse went to like 150.

A little while later he came over and said sorry if the joke put me on the spot and I brushed it off joking that he discovered my secret and we both laughed it off...   I have no idea how to describe the mixture of relief terror humor and confusion I'm feeling right now X_x"	"Oh wow I understand why that would get you anxious. Some people just don't think before they make insensitive ""jokes"" like that. He saw you, someone not dressing feminine, and assumed you were as careless as he was and would find that funny. I would honestly let him know that even though you brushed it off, you appreciate him apologizing. He obviously realized that you didn't find it tasteful or appropriate, especially for a work environment. Glad he apologized.
Lol before I started transitioning, some girl at school said ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay, we all know you‚Äôre really a girl on the inside.‚Äù And I think I looked shocked because I just kinda laughed it off, but later she said ‚Äúi-I‚Äôm just kidding.‚Äù Even though I totally freaked. 
Not to make you more nervous, but it sounds like you might have been outed, actually. If he came back to apologize, it sorta sounds like your reaction stuck with him. 

What a mess -_-
Not to take away from the original topic...but when this phenomenom happens to me, I always think it's the Law of Attraction at work. Like, I attracted this situation to me, because of how much I didn't want it to happen, so then of course, it happens...I don't know...
I've had people at work make jokes like that to me all the time. Not anything harmful, we're very pro LGBT but out humor is also very crass. 

I just ""joke"" back but while being very serious. Part of our store is clothing and anytime I'm in the women's section or working on anything related to women's clothing I always get asked if I'm doing some personal shopping. Usually I'm just like oh I wouldn't be caught dead in this, or no it's not my style. Just dropping tiny hints everywhere. 
I'm so sorry that happened to you. It's bad enough when people make shitty jokes, but when that joke targets you... that's terrible.
on the bright side, if he's apologetic, he might also be open to learning and improving/general being a decent person if op \*does\* come out.
Hey, maybe he'd date y-

Sooo... I guess I'm starting to accept my look, amd who I am?"	"this is so epic
I am AMAB and had a similar experience yesterday. Realizing all the body images issues I was having was really dysphoria. I would look in the mirror at times and just wanted to look different. I thought it was because I was overweight but in reality it was because I didn‚Äôt like how the body fat was distributed. I had lost almost 70 lbs and still wanted to loose more. I wanted to get as much fat as I wanted off. Only realizing this the past few days. I would never have been happy but I would never know why. I would imagine my self with a female body while working out and trying to achieve that look. Yesterday  I looked in the mirror and I didn‚Äôt see my body the same anymore. It almost looked foreign to me. Know this now I can go into working out a bit differently now.

Bathroom question for those who use the mens	CW: bathroom talk. So I am transmasc and steadily working towards using the mens room more and trying to pass as a man better. Do people who typically pee standing sit down to pee when going #2? I‚Äôm trying to figure out when exactly to use an stp and such and if I need to always or if I sit in the stall for a while it won‚Äôt sound weird to the cis guys in the bathroom. Thanks in advance!	"hi, trans girl here, generally yes all guys sit when going #2
Good question. Former men's room user here. When you go #2, any accompanying #1s are typically done sitting down. When you release one, the other follows pretty quickly. If you want to fake a poo in order to make your tinkies, I think you'll be okay. Just stay there for a couple of minutes after you're done, use an extra wad of tp so your neighbors can hear the sound of the dispenser, and be on your way. I've been sitting to pee for years and had used this method without getting any looks.
I just sit to pee and don‚Äôt worry about pretending to poo. no one is paying attention to what the others in the stalls are doing.

I barely pass but as long as I don‚Äôt speak I‚Äôm ok and no one cares about me
Personally I don't pay attention to who's doing what in the bathroom, I go in and use the facility as intended and just ignore what other people are doing because I think it's just weird to listen to other people using a toilet. 

Guys typically go in and find an empty urinal or stall (not next to another person) and do their business. 
I'm happy to offer help because I'm still using the men's room since I have an enormous beard, and I think I'd look really out of place in a women's restroom.
I'm a cis dude, and I sometimes have problems peeing standing up. So then I just go to the....sitting toilet(?) and pee sitting.
Other times I just want to pee in peace, and I go into the sitting toilet, lock the door, and pee standing up with my pants down.
Just pee where you want to pee. (With consent, lol)
Honestly, I used to sit to pee long before I realized I was trans (mtf), and, outside of high school, no one has said anything to me about it.
AMAB here - 99% of the time I sit when I have to go in a public restroom and have for at least the last 10 years. Cis guys do not care/do not notice... I can't think of a single situation (ehh, maybe a concert talking about the openers or maybe at work?) where anyone has ever said anything at all to me in a public restroom... Tbh most guys avoid eye contact completely in my experience...
what's an stp? sorry.

edit: i'm a cis guy most of the time i sit when i shit and pee.
Cis here: i just like to sit down to relax in my own mind for a moment. a bathroom stall is a private place, you determine how long you need.

any one who comes in after you has no idea how long you have been there. take joy and solice in that.  once you are in there, all they know is whether you are wearing shoes or not.
The mens room is a weird place. No one speaks, no one looks around, everyone acts like they are there alone. You can stand on your head in the stall‚Ä¶. Nothing will be acknowledged! DONT initiate conversation! I tried that once‚Ä¶ lol
Trans chick here. I've sat down to pee my entire life and I've asked guy friends if they did too before I was out. A lot of them didn't even stand to pee when that was all they were doing. So u good homie.
I'm amab and tbh its very rare i find a mens loo clean enough to consider sitting on. Alot of them are disgusting here in UK.  Don't know if its different anywhere else. X
Here‚Äôs the play boss, walk in like you own the place. It‚Äôs not a public/private bathroom it‚Äôs your bathroom. Kick open the stall with as much force as you can so everyone knows it‚Äôs your bathroom and this is the stall you are using. Sit down and pee because you can. If anyone ask you any question other than if you have extra tp, ask them if they are g*y, most men will promptly shut the fuck up. If they don‚Äôt ask if they want to go on a date first or if they want to see your dick in person. After said person fucks the hell off, wash your hands. Then walk out like the mother fucking boss you are.
Some guys will sit just for #1. Sometimes guys think they need to do #2 but it's a false alarm. 

Long story short, if you go #1 in a stall, it's not likely folks are going to look at you strange, especially if you stick around for a minute or two after finishing the pee.
Totally indesputable rules of the men's room provided by transgirl.
1: When using a urinal you pick one that has atleast 1 free one on either side. Do not look left or right. Complete silence is required.
2. Dont pretend others dont exist but pretend like you do. Simply do your own thing.
3. The stalls are usually for the #1 #2 combo but nobody cares if you just do #1. Refer to rule 2.
I‚Äôm your polar opposite here: trans girl who‚Äôs afraid to go into the women‚Äôs bathroom and nervous of sitting down cause yucky toilets but I don‚Äôt wanna be stared at or judged.
As a trans woman still using the men's room always, ALWAYS  check the seat some people and some children pee on the seat without cleaning up after them selves so always look before sitting down
Trans woman here! Nearly all men sit down to pee when going #2, except for those who do the stupid ""stronger men stand up to poop"" thing.
Honestly as a cis man just sit if you want to in general, people wouldn‚Äôt bat an eyelid
I do, I‚Äôm in the same boat as you. Bathroom dysphoria is REAL. I use the mens bathroom only at work and hold it anywhere else because that‚Äôs the only mens room I feel safe in. My coworkers know and respect me. I am the only guy who can‚Äôt use the urinal so I have to wait for the one stall to be open. But it does make me feel better knowing others sit, too lol. But when I‚Äôm in the stall, doesn‚Äôt matter who comes in, if some comes in I do not leave that stall until they are done. I‚Äôm too much of a scaredy-cat lol
I always use the cubicle no matter what. I do it quick, wash my hands and go. But I also make sure I clean the bowl before sitting, cause its always dirty in the men's room
Personally I‚Äôve never used a standing toilet, always found it super uncomfortable. Loads of people do though, really just depends
I sit for both because standing is gross. I know other men who feel the same way, but I think the ""norm"" is to stand if you only have to pee. However, no one should bat an eye if you always sit.
i‚Äôm a trans guy and all the times i‚Äôve used the guys bathroom i‚Äôve pretended to play on my phone walking in and glance upward to see the stalls.
i‚Äôm also a pretty fast walker so that helps.


i always sit and i‚Äôve never had any complications besides a few confused looks on my way in or out, i just confusingly look back at the person and then look back down to my phone.
the majority of people aren‚Äôt gonna go out of their way to bother you if you‚Äôve got head phone in and are looking at your phone, from my experience that is. 
just don‚Äôt look like your confused or nervous to be there.



after typing this i realized i didn‚Äôt answer your questions correctly but ima leave it for other people ig üï∫
i also restated a bunch of the same stuff, but seriously pretending to be on my phone has helped me a lot. i also place bets with my friends like ‚Äú25 cents says i don‚Äôt go to the guys bathroom rn‚Äù and that motivates me even more to go to the guys ü§Ω‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
My cis bf sits to pee, along with most other penis owners I know. Even if you weren‚Äôt shitting it wouldn‚Äôt be very weird to pee in the stall.
former mens room user: i used to stand to pee in the stall, urinals are icky and there's too much of a chance that people will see what's going on. 

a hard lesson to learn is that nobody gives a shit unless there's only one stall and youre using it
I would say it‚Äôs either way, my brother is cis and he sits when he takes a pee.
nobody will care if you are in a stall or not. at least outside a school
Thank you!!!
g-d bless thank u for this. i‚Äôm 1000x more scared of using an stp than i am of people thinking i just have to shit all the time. rationally i know that no one else cares what i do in the bathroom but it‚Äôs nice to have it said
Have you actually came across people who give a shit (pun intended) if someone uses a stall for peeing alone?

That seems wild to me, it's so far from anything they should be concerned about.
Not giving a shit? This is the way.
Stand to pee device.
I kind of hover my ass about an inch above the loo seat. No way I‚Äôm touching that loo seat
Wait what
Honestly I sit in the stall for #1 and #2 because I usually do both. I only use the urinal and stand when I'm in a hurry.
I can totally understand that. Ultimately everyone in a men's room just wants to mind their own business, but it helps me to take steps to ensure no one thinks I'm ""weird"" for peeing sitting down. I'm glad if I helped you in any way.
Not that I know of, but I mostly would do that stuff for my own benefit. It made me feel like I was camouflaged so I was more comfortable using the men's bathroom, when I normally would feel super awkward like I didn't belong there. No one ever said anything about it, at least.
thanx. I'm new to all of this. is their a subreddit for asking difficult things.
So there was this small trend a few years ago where men would brag about standing over the toilet to poop, and the whole goal was that if you could successfully use the bathroom without sitting down, you are a ""stronger man"". It's the dumbest crap on the planet (no pun intended) and not even worth my brain power to try and figure out why these particular men thought it was a good idea.
I just do it because I don't like the idea of standing while peeing, standing next to someone while peeing, and I like privacy in the rest room
Same here
Totally fine to ask these things as they come up! But if you have specific trans related questions r/asktransgender is a good place to start. Or r/ftm if you‚Äôre transmasculine (umbrella term that covers binary trans men and also some non-binary folks) or r/mtf for transfemme folks (same idea).

Good luck to you!
Probably this one tbh lol, any of the trans reddits will answer questions

Don‚Äôt date a trans guy if you don‚Äôt like them being a guy!	"I‚Äôm using trans guy instead of man because the parties involved are young teens. 
I was picking my daughter up from her club and heard a  kerfuffle (non shouting disagreement) between two of her friends which I will make up names for now. 
Alex is Ftm and tend to dress androgynous, James is his boyfriend who is a cis hetero guy. I walked in as James was taking umbrage at the fact that Alex used the men‚Äôs room. He said that Alex was dressed as a girl (that‚Äôs debatable, pants and T-shirt are pretty universal) so he should be using the women‚Äôs bathroom.  
I didn‚Äôt intervene, but Alex defended himself and walked away, then my daughter nicely spoke to James about not being a dick, and Alex is a guy at all times. 
I gave Alex a ride home and he didn‚Äôt want to talk about it, but he has stayed at our house before and knows he can ask for help and my daughter knows she can come get me if an adult is needed.  

Anyway, after all that, I was kind of pissed. I have never met James, but Alex has known him since before he came out as ftm, and says he is actually an ally and a nine guy, but ugh. I can‚Äôt help think James is trying to date the girl he used to know, not the real Alex. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs all, thanks for coming to my Ted rant.


Update: Well, I told my daughter about this post and she told me that Alex and James broke up this morning. Not specifically about the bathroom thing, but the bigger issue of James not wanting to date a guy. I never wish heartbreak or unhappiness upon anyone, but I‚Äôll say this is for the best. How many school relationships lead to marriage in the long run, not many."	"If James is a hetero guy like you say, then why is he with Alex? Two men together=James isn't straight.
Sounds like either James isn't straight or he just doesn't respect his boyfriend and I'm gonna hazard a guess that it's AT LEAST the latter. Alex can do better than a guy that fights with him over where he pees.
Sounds like James (and maybe Alex) needs to be reminded that Allyship is an action, ally is not a label. He is not being an ally when he polices bathroom use. Too many people use ""but I'm an ally"" to excuse phobic behavior. My answer is always, ""not right now you aren't"" 

And half the time the Ally behaviors they cite are just ""being a decent person"" which gains you exactly 0 gold stars from me.
And that's why I broke with my hetero bf before coming out. Also, I'm ftm and my name is Alex! '0'
As someone who was in this exact situation for EIGHT YEARS, I'm so glad Alex got smart and kicked James to the curb. Max (fake name) and I dated since freshman year and oh man did it leave some serious issues behind. 

I hope this whole fiasco didnt ruin relationships for Alex. Thank you for being there for him, and let him know he made the right move! Don't let him start doubting it
Fuck that guy. If he says he is supportive then changes what he says when he sees it. That isn't supportive, that is manipulative. 

Does anyone have any experience or know any stats on trans dating cis people. Specifically what genders people prefer to date before/after coming out. 

This post got me curious, do FtM and MtF perfer to date cis males or females?
1. good on you for supporting alex! we need more parents like you. really wish my dad was that nice
2. Honestly alex might hurt a little but in all seriously F james, alex is better off without him. he knew what the situation was and yet was a butt. you're 100% right james was trying to date the girl he used to know. but she is dead and alex is now here and much happier about it.
[removed]
I know! That‚Äôs why I think he is trying to date Alex as the girl he used to know. Or he is not as straight as he claims.
It‚Äôs just a freaking bathroom. You go in, do your business, don‚Äôt make a mess, wash your hands, maybe check your makeup or hair as applicable, and then leave. Who cares which version of bathroom that is done in. (Well, James cares apparently).
I don‚Äôt think I have run into a bad ally like that before, but if I do, I‚Äôll remember ‚Äúnot right now you aren‚Äôt‚Äù
It‚Äôs you! I‚Äôd say Alex is a popular name, but I just made it up because it‚Äôs neutral. But funnily enough, ‚ÄòAlex‚Äô didn‚Äôt change his name after coming out as his name was actually neutral already and he was ok with it. Lucky planning on his parents part I guess.
Yeah, I love Alex because it's gender neutral but here in Brazil Alex is a male exclusive name."	e98jeq	trans	95	0.97	2019-12-11 15:31:29
I think my brother may be trans, should I talk to them about it?	"I‚Äôm sorry if this isn‚Äôt allowed here, I am in my mid twenties and live with my husband and my younger brother (18). I had custody of him since he was 17 and let him have the spare room and bathroom  in our apartment because my mother was very neglectful to him. He‚Äôs still in high school and is a good kid, I‚Äôm trying to support him until he graduates and can get on his feet. He has told me in the past that he is bisexual, and I‚Äôm very supportive of that. I myself am bi. He has told me before that his best friend is trans too which I‚Äôve also shown support for. 

Anyways, I don‚Äôt ever go in his room unless I‚Äôm looking for something, which he knows and has never said he has a problem with it, since some of my stuff is still in there due to lack of space. I‚Äôve also noticed that he takes our stuff sometimes without asking and doesn‚Äôt put it back, so I‚Äôve had to go in there before looking for stuff. This morning when he was already at school I started having really bad allergies, and I couldn‚Äôt find the Benadryl anywhere so I decided to go check in his room to see if he had it. Didn‚Äôt see it when I glanced around so I peeked in his bathroom, and immediately noticed mascara on the counter, bras and bikinis and skirts hanging in the closet which is right by the shower.  I felt bad for even going in there at that point, I wasn‚Äôt trying to snoop and didn‚Äôt touch anything, just wanted some Benadryl.  I hurried out of there and feel like I violated his privacy and may have discovered something about him accidentally. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm going to say anything but I also want him to know that I support him and don‚Äôt want him to think he has to hide his identity from me. 

I apologize again, I have never faced a situation like this before and want to treat it delicately. Any advice is appreciated!"	"Don't try to crack an egg; build a nest.
I wouldn't try to force a conversation. Let them come out when they are ready to share, if that is what they end up doing. You can signal support through things like telling them you love and support them no matter what and letting them see you enjoying trans positive and trans inclusive media.
Nothing to add except that from what I can tell you must be an amazing sister. I can only imagine the effort it takes to hold custody over your sibling, especially at their age. The amount of thought you‚Äôve put in shows how much you care, I‚Äôm honestly touched!
First thing first: pretend this never happened. Whether they are questioning and trying out thing, are a femboy or into drag, or are indeed a girl, if they didn't told you they are not ready yet and trying to force anything can only make things worse.

They know you're bi and are already out to you about it, they know you accept and support their trans friend, so they surely get already that they can safely come out to you if/when appropriate. 

Oh and yes: thank you for being the best sister they could have <3
Don't force anything on them or inquire on those things though I'd say maybe just showing that your supportive of trans ppl and just try to make them more comfortable with coming out though only really do it in hints bc if you just intrude on privacy and assume things it'd only make it worse
First things first the fact you came here says a lot about you as a person and as a trans person I want to thank you for your support. Honestly the most important thing is to give him time and space to explore his own identity. He'll open up to you when the time is right.
I wouldn‚Äôt talk to them about it, but one thing that you can do is make them feel safe. Be vocal about supporting trans people and trans rights. Continue to maintain a positive and comfortable home environment. Celebrate when others come out, either to you or in public. If they are in fact trans, they will make it a priority to let you know because they know you are a supportive family member. If they aren‚Äôt trans, they have a good role model to model their support of others. üíñ
Cracking an egg before it‚Äôs ready kills the baby bird. Building a nest, protecting, and warming the egg lets it hatch. The best thing you can do is be a person they can talk to about this stuff. If they actually are trans, they will tell you if and when they are comfortable doing so.
You‚Äôre a really good sister!  Lot of great replies here too.
You know, one good thing you could try is to tell them a made-up or true trans story and show a positive reaction to it. So, they might feel comfortable coming out by themselves eventually.
Well, if they're leaving all that stuff out, they must be really confident with you. I would just make sure that they know you will love them no matter what.
Lots of people say not to bring it up, BUT, you know your sibling better than anyone on the internet does. Though I do support just giving space and not reacting, I would say it's good to bring up if you think they are in a dark place and possibly in a ""no one would understand"" depressive mentality. Otherwise just let them fly, show subtle support, and just gauge.
Where you all getting non garbage family from ;-;

Plz give me a link. I'd die to have a sister like this.
All i can say is i wish you were my big sister
I say you should sit down and just ask what they feel they are. That's how I came out but it's different for everyone. I wish you and your sibling luck
I‚Äôm gonna be the black sheep here and say maybe don‚Äôt act like you know, but act like it‚Äôs your idea. MANY MANY closeted crosssdressers and trans folks to include myself (I‚Äôm mostly out to my close circles) fantasized that someone would rope me into female games or whatever. Play a ‚Äú prank ‚Äú in his sleep and make him into a girl or do his nails after giving me small meds. I used to do it to my sister sloppily knowing my sister would do it backüòàüòÇ
The best thing that you can do is give him space to figure things out. It's a scary difficult thing to navigate especially when your 18. Forcing the issue will do more harm than good. 

If he realizes they might be trans or non-binary the best thing you can do is be their number one support. Let them know that you accept them for who they and let them know it's ok.
This is an amazing comment.
Thank you, that‚Äôs what I figured was best to do and I will definitely let them come to me when they‚Äôre ready!
Thank you so much, I won‚Äôt say anything to them and will continue to show support the way I have been. I doubt myself a lot and just wanted to be sure it was the right thing to do by pretending I never saw anything. I appreciate this!
Thank you! I‚Äôm not going to say anything to them about it, and just continue to show support like usual.
Totally agree! As well as make comments showing you disagree with the current political climate and all the bills they are trying to put forth against the community!"	10k8uu4	trans	95	0.97	2023-01-24 16:05:00
I miss playing sports :(	"I used to play rugby before I came out. I just miss it so much but if I played on the girls team I'd be absolutely miserable and I refuse to deal with that ""debate"" BS about trans athletes that seem to be popping up everywhere. There are no extracurriculars in my school that I can join (let alone even a bathroom I'm allowed to use, but that's beside the point). idk what the point of this post was. I guess I just feel rlly excluded. I just wish there were unisex teams or clubs I could join in my area. Really miss sport."	"Look for a coed soccer or softball league. They're everywhere this time of year.
If you are up for it, definitely create a rugby club!   You could let anyone join, regardless of gender, to come play rugby with you. Although it would be pretty informal and stuff it would still be good for you to be able to play. Also I do have a little experience with being a trans athlete (but no one really cares about trans men in sports so I don‚Äôt have it as rough) so feel free to vent to me about this.
What's stopping you. Have you tried to contact a local club and ask them? You may be surprised how accepting  they are. I use to play ladies hockey üèí  until I injured myself. Had no problems whatsoever.
I just swapped to cycling or sports I could enjoy by myself. I do miss the camaraderie of my martial arts clubs but I don't miss the queerphobia.
Have you considered touch rugby? The differences there might not be nearly as much as when indulging in a contact sport.
I play basketball with girls as an MTF, it's pretty dope how bad I am.
not in my area :(
You could try starting one. I organized an informal basketball meetup because I couldn't find a trans or queer friendly option in my area. It may or may not be practical depending on your situation but if it's an option, there's no harm in trying. 

If you're in this situation, guaranteed other people are too."	vqx65k	trans	95	0.99	2022-07-04 02:32:06
"""oh shit, that was dysphoria?"""	"So I did cheerleading as a kid. I liked doing some gymnastics and routines, they were fun enough. I, like 7-10 years old (I did it for 3 years), still felt really uncomfortable in the leotards (the uniforms for practice, as revealing as like one piece swimsuits). They were also hot pink. :/ mehh

And when we did competitions at the end of each if the years, on the last one when I was 10 it was mandatory that we wore makeup???? as part of the uniform???? and??? had hairspray and a pink bow??? Straight up after it I remember crying in the bathroom and washing my face off because I hated how that had made me feel

At the time I didn't know why I hated it so much, but now I recognize that was some very fucking crippling dysphoria. Anyways at least I didn't do it again after that because I just felt worse about the forced feminity everywhere each year. so I just, quit

*Anyways it's wild to recognize so SO many times I was dysphoric even before puberty.*"	"Looking back at the past and realizing how many, many signs there were...
There‚Äôs so much that I‚Äôve realized was so obviously dysphoria that I completely ignored for so long üòÖ
I'm sorry if this is rude or ignorant to ask but.

What us dysphoria? Like how does it feel and when does it happen? 

I've tried googling it but can't really find any answers.
I was on the football field staring at the cheerleaders and wishing I was there so this totally resonates for me
That would have been a dream life for me, always wanted to do gymnastics
That's ok!

I think my most severe source of dysphoria rn is my chest. It's basically just a part of my body that feels like Does Not belong and makes me feel horrible. The flatter my chest is, as I bind it, I feel the most confident and .... normal? Or, that how I look actually fits who I am. If I imagine myself, I have a flat chest. But in reality that's not the case, which for some reason causes me a lot of distress. 

I really don't know a good way to explain it. But in my case it's a STRONG negative feeling from being perceived as a girl, or having long hair, or having a visible chest, or being curvy. Naturally I cut my hair, bind my chest, and wear masculine clothes. And gives me *eu*phoria, I feel really happy when I can do that.

I can't describe the happiness I felt when I wore my first binder and saw myself with a flat chest. It's crazy how intense that joy was that I was about to cry!  .....and people are out here saying 'it's a fad they're doing it for attention' like what the fuck are you talking about
Alright! Thanks for explaining it to me.

The reason I was wondering is because I'm questioning my gender and I don't know if I feel dysphoria or not.
If you feel uncomfy being perceived as or having the body of your agab that could be dysphoria. If you feel really happy when being perceived as or presenting as the opposite or other than your agab, that could be euphoria. Both are important to take into consideration! Also maybe take a look at r/TransTryouts if you haven't already!

I wish you the best on figuring it out <3
Dysphoria doesn't necessarily mean you're miserable or you hate your body or you can't stand the idea of living as a guy. For a lot of people it's a whole lot more subtle than that. ""I wouldn't mind staying a guy, but I'd rather be a woman"" is dysphoria. ""I wish I had dysphoria because then I could transition"" is dysphoria. [Cis guys would not rather be women](https://www.reddit.com/r/asktransgender/comments/4hgcp8/cisgender_people_what_happens_when_you_question/). They actively *like* being guys. They aren't just settling for it because they're stuck with it. The point isn't that we're all miserable tortured souls who hate our bodies and want to die every time we're misgendered. If something different sounds like an improvement to you, that is a manifestation of dysphoria.

Remember that ""transition is scary and seems daunting"" is not why cis people don't want to transition.

Trans with doubts doesn't equal cis.

Trans and terrified doesn't equal cis.

Trans and in massive denial doesn't equal cis.

Trans with abysmal self-esteem doesn't equal cis.

Trans with impostor syndrome (google it) doesn't equal cis.

Read [The Null Hypothecis](https://freethoughtblogs.com/nataliereed/2012/04/17/the-null-hypothecis/) and [That Was Dysphoria?](http://freethoughtblogs.com/zinniajones/2013/09/that-was-dysphoria-8-signs-and-symptoms-of-indirect-gender-dysphoria/) I think they'll both speak to you a lot.

Forget doubting whether you should transition. Doubt whether you *shouldn't* transition. What if you regret not transitioning, or not transitioning sooner? (Spoiler: that's way more likely than regretting transition.) Take every scared ""what if"" question and change ""transition"" to ""not transition"". What if, by not transitioning, you screw up the rest of your life? What if you don't transition and you're never happy later in life? If all those fears can be used against transition, they can equally be used in favor of it.

Don't angst about being 100% sure. You do NOT have to be 100% sure to act on your feelings, and there's loads of non-permanent things you can do. I'm guessing that you think if you come out as Trans you have to do ALL THE TRANSITION THINGS and there is NO GOING BACK and you have to be VERY VERY 110% SURE or else BAD THINGS WILL HAPPEN and you will be MISERABLE FOREVER. None of this is true. Transition is a process, not an event. Just do whatever you need to do to feel as comfortable as possible in your own skin and in the world as you move through it. That's the entire point; the rest is noise. Transition is not a roller coaster you strap yourself onto. *You* are in charge. Try stuff out, keep what works, chuck what doesn't. That's really all there is to it. That doesn't mean you have to have surgery or live as a woman or anything else. If you want to be seen as a woman, put yourself into social situations as a woman, whether online or offline. If you want to try wearing jeans from the women's department, go get a pair of jeans. If you want this or that surgery, go for it. If you want to take hormones, take hormones. If you want to stop taking hormones later, stop taking them. If you want to go back *on* hormones later still, do that. Etc.
Thank you, I'll check it out.

I do feel a bit uncomfortable with my agab and I have felt a bit happy being perceived as the gender opposite of my agab but it's never been to the point were I have cried or broken down.

Also you can be trans without even having dysphoria! So please don't think ""I haven't suffered enough to be valid"" or anything of the sort. Just feeling 'a lil uncomfy' can be dysphoria, there is no set bar where you have to be a certain amount of upset or anything like that.
ooh, that explains a lot. I wasn't sure how strong the dysphoria had to be. Thanks for telling me."	mk8jth	trans	96	0.98	2021-04-05 00:26:25
Went out in fem clothes for the first time!	Went out with my bro and some friends to go see Sonic 2 today and I went out in girls clothes for the first time. I was so excited, some guy gave me a dirty look in the bathroom, as I'm basically pre everything (I've shaved and am growing my hair out) but I don't care. I don't let that ruin my day!	"Sounds like it‚Äôs time to switch to the ladies room?

Congratulations! This was one of the hardest steps for me.
A A A A A A!!!! CONGRATS CONGRATS CONGRATS THATS SO COOL FOR YOU !!! :DD !! I bet you looked wonderful and I'm glad you had a nice time out !!
This ain't even my final form
I was very nervous but I had a great time!
I still look like a guy wearing girls clothes, so I think it was more a ""why are you wearing that"" look. Baby steps though, I'll get there soon enough!
Thank you! It was definitely a rush!

Finally went on the streets as a woman üëóüë†‚ò∫Ô∏è	"So i finally took the decision to go on the streets as my true self. As the woman i want to be. 
So before I started my regular appointment at my therapist i got dressed in the bathroom at her office. Just a nice top, black skirt and heels (also had my breastforms and a wig for more female appearence). üëóüë†

 So afterwards i took the decision to walk out of her office as my true self. AND IT WAS AWESOME. Just the feeling of walking through the city as a woman felt so great and right. I probably didn't pass but whatever I felt great and people didn't seemed to care at all. I even went to the womens' bathroom at a restaurant i stopped by while drivin home. Made me a little euphoric ‚ò∫Ô∏è üë†"	"Yay!!!! Congrats ü•≥ ü•∞

I did the same about a week or so ago. It does feel amazing! üíñ
We're proud of you! x
That‚Äôs awesome xx go girl xx be who you are xx
I love this story, and I hope that you get more chances to dress up in public.
congrats
So happy for you I know it is not easy and you look so lovely I'm sure you pass easily."	vcp93r	trans	90	1.0	2022-06-15 07:52:38
Using the men‚Äôs restroom as a trans guy...	I‚Äôm pre-T so it was kinda risky being in there, but I felt like I was a cis guy. It was amazing to go into the correct bathroom.	"I‚Äôm pre-T too; I recently went on a road trip and decided to use the men‚Äôs restroom (I tend to get gendered correctly more often in conservative places, go fucking figure). I was so paranoid because it felt like everyone was staring at me, I felt like I was sweating bullets when I was in there. I told my girlfriend and she said people were definitely staring at me, but it was probably my bright teal shorts with red sharks on them lol. It was really nice to go into the right bathroom for sure though!
Using your correct bathroom for the first time is a nerve wracking experience. Glad to see you were able to get through it! :D
Talking as a non passing trans girl who still uses the men's room, people don't give a shit in the men's restroom, people don't even look at each other, so if you feel like people are staring or something, you're probably overthinking this. 
Anyways it's always great to hear that, congrats for doing that man! :)
congrats!!!! i remember the first time i did too, i was sooo worried. but now it's second nature, can't imagine using a woman's washroom. it feels pretty cool for something so simple!
Thank you all for all of the nice comments! It‚Äôs nice to know there are people like you that understand how big this was for me. üíõüíõüíõ
Yeah, you‚Äôll find that the only people who come close to competing with trans women for not wanting to be in the men‚Äôs restroom are cis men.
Yeah I was going to say the same thing. For what ever reason all this stupid bathroom stuff is centered on the woman's bathroom."	8tmjn4	trans	90	0.99	2018-06-25 01:14:52
It doesn‚Äôt get easier knowing that who I am hurts people	It‚Äôs my birthday and at 12am exactly I had to have a discussion with my girlfriend about how she feels restricted in what she can say about/touch on my body and what social terms she can use to describe me because I made a joke. This morning I got an urgent phone call about an international trip. I need to tell them what gender I want to room with. I asked a friend if I could room with them because I don‚Äôt want to make anyone else uncomfortable on my first trip out as trans. They agreed but I haven‚Äôt seen them in years and I hope they don‚Äôt change their mind when they see me. My girlfriend made an assumption about what gender I‚Äôd want to room with and I informed her that I‚Äôve started easing into using the men‚Äôs bathroom because after 6 months on T I can‚Äôt physically bring myself to experience the discomfort and fear that I have using the women‚Äôs room. I don‚Äôt belong there. Nobody wants me there. I need to use the bathroom and the men‚Äôs room hasn‚Äôt made me feel anything close to the terror I experience in the women‚Äôs room. It didn‚Äôt go well. I got a birthday envelope with my birth name crossed out and my name replacing it but the card inside said niece and birth name. I got another envelope with my childhood nickname on it in a fierce refusal to use my name. It‚Äôs one thing to write something like Davy instead of David, but it was as if they wrote ‚ÄúBubba Lastname.‚Äù It looked so wrong on the official address label. My lunch is half-made on the counter and I can‚Äôt get up off the floor. The world is too heavy. I just want to crawl into a ball and disappear. People make it very clear that I make their lives harder and I‚Äôm expected to listen and respect their feelings. I guess since I‚Äôm the one who caused them after all. Who listens to me when I‚Äôm crushed by the way they spiral and break down when I try to feel the slightest bit comfortable in this life?	"Not to argue or anything, but who you are isn't hurting anyone.

You're just you. You're just doing what every cis person out there is doing: trying to live the best life you can.

Where any pain or discomfort arises, it comes not from who you are, but from *other people's* transphobic attitudes or the pointless gendering of shit that doesn't need to be gendered.

None of that is on you.

Every human being has, IMO, a fundamental right to have their identity recognized and respected. Sadly, some people don't seem capable or interested in respecting that basic right when it comes to trans people.

That's on them. Not on you.

Who you are is not hurting anybody. Other people are hurting you, and themselves, with their transphobia. To be sure, they'll be quick to blame *you* for *their* attitudes and actions. But lets put the responsibility where it truly belongs.
Bigotry isn‚Äôt a feeling, it‚Äôs a choice. Unlike you being yourself, that‚Äôs not a choice. 

Boo hoo to all the shitty people in your life! They need to grow up and stop making their problems your problem. It‚Äôs really not your problem, like imagine someone fell on their face and they got up and yelled at you. Would you take it? No! Cut people off, set boundaries, break some hearts. 

I know you can push past these people, we as the community believe in you!
I've been there and it's shit. But you existing isn't hurting anyone. I'm sorry you have all these shitty people in your life and I hope you're able to find folks who'll accept you
Nope. This crap isn't on you.  You're just you, they're being unsupportive and selfish.  You honestly don't need these kind of people in your life and, if they can't be respectful, you need to limit their role in your life.  You deserve better.
Happy birthday!  
I'm sorry that you have to go through those hardships.  
You definetly don't make their lives harder by transitioning, don't worry. It's not about you. Their lives are already hard as they are, and their suffering is just spilling over to you.
You deserve respect & dignity. You deserve to be loved, accepted & celebrated for the wonderful human that you are. I am so sorry the people in your life are letting you down. You are not letting them down, you are not hurting them. They are hurting themselves by not putting in the minimal effort required to show you how much you matter to them. They are the ones driving a wedge between you and them. 

I know it feels like you're the cause, but you are not. You deserve better than this.
If being considerate of the fact that you're trans makes your girlfriend feel restricted, she might not be a viable person to continue dating. It sorta sounds like she still sees you as a girl and is just humouring you.
The name thing is so hard. I'm sorry you had to go through that on your birthday. I try to think of it as a different person, when I read my name or see my picture. Because that's not who you are. 

Happy birthday and i wish you many more as you live authentically!
I'm so sorry you're going through that. 
I want to write more but not in a great place myself. 

However, you simply being who you are isn't hurting anyone. They're hurting you and it's okay to acknowledge that. It's shitty behavior, to say the very least.

You deserve to be loved, celebrated and appreciated on your birthday. Might not be much, but Happy birthday and you deserve better.
You just want what all cis people already have. The idea that you‚Äôre a burden or hurting other people by being trans is a facade, and people who pretend like they‚Äôre hurt by it are trying to guilt trip you.
Absolutely this."	w9ngsm	trans	89	0.96	2022-07-27 19:22:02
Gender Euphoria	Tonight, my sister and I went out to a very much after hours predominately straight bar. They‚Äôre open until 5am in Alabama. So you can imagine the clientele. We‚Äôll my trans sister and I walk in, zero issues with the bouncers and our IDs.  We walk in and all eyes are on us. Then, we went to walk to the bathroom and this very cis very straight man said ‚Äúdamn baby. You fine as hell‚Äù and I‚Äôve never been more happy to be cat called in my life. We had to walk through this group of boys to make it to the bathroom and certainly thought I would get hate crimed. He tries to get my number and I gently let him down. ‚ÄúSorry I already have a boyfriend‚Äù to which he replied ‚Äú a girl as pretty as you needs a ring‚Äù. I have never felt so euphoric.	"Ahh, Trans Inclusive Radical Misogyny, its euphoric when you start out but gets weird down the line. Either ways  you rock girl, this is not gonna be the last time you'll be cat called so buckle up <3
I do understand what you mean. It was a great surprise to hear approval when I most certainly thought I was going to get jumped.
I love this new TIRM‚Ä¶ ‚Äúterm.‚Äù Kat Blaque had a video called ‚ÄúWhy Am I So Attracted to Toxic Masculinity‚Äù I‚Äôve been meaning to watch for like a year now and I have a gut feeling this will be a part of it."	sarfpa	trans	87	0.98	2022-01-23 11:12:34
Have any other trans people experienced something like this?	A few weeks ago I went to use the bathroom at my school and because I have only been out for about a year, I haven't started medically transitioning and not everyone knows that I'm trans I used the women's bathroom and when I walked in there was a group of girls hanging out in there. I went straight into the stall and I assume that they were unable to assume my gender because they probably didn't get a good enough look at me, they began asking me if I was a boy or a girl and I just tried my best to ignore them because I knew what these girls were like, because of me ignoring them they started banging on the door asking the same things again and as I was just about to flush and leave as one of them decided to climb onto the toilet in the stall next to mine and looked over the edge to try and as she said 'check my gender' and even as I was leaving the others continued to yell at me from the door of the bathroom asking what I had in my pants/ what my gender was. I haven't been able to use a gendered public bathroom since then, that interaction made my anxiety heaps worse.	"Do you know them? Report it to the office immediately. Those types of kids shit their pants when they get in trouble.
That's fucking ruthless. Fuck anyone who does that.
Since this happened at school, report it as soon as you can, that is 100% sexual harassment and transphobia. If the school does nothing about it then report it to the police.
That's messed up, I'm sorry you had to go through that
Aw, sorry. Hope the Mean Girls get whatever karma has in store for them! 
I hope there's another restroom you can use.
Happened to me in high school, I arranged a meeting with the principal and threatened to sue everybody involved, I never had a problem with it again
When I was in highschool I was terrified of something like that happening to me. I don't know if it will apply to you but what I did was taking to my counselor about the fact that I was transitioning and didn't wanted to make other people uncomfortable by using either of the standard gendered restrooms so she was kind enough to give me acces to a gender neutral bathroom in the front office of the school, even after she left I kept using that restroom for the remainder of my senior year and I felt very lucky that I didn't have to deal with the anxiety of having to use gendered restrooms. The only downside is that it was very far from some of my classes and there could be a line to get in since I wasn't the only trans person using that restroom.

If you feel safe doing so, maybe try talking to someone at your school to see if that could be an option for you, and also bring up that incident so they know that is a safety concern and they do something to those bullys
That sounds like bullying and harassment! So sorry that happened to you! Report the students who did this. If you want or need confidentiality, tell the school counselor.
unfortunately I've had a similar experience as a ftm in school bathrooms since that I will only go to gender-neutral bathrooms or mens bathroom when its empty

&#x200B;

Experiences like these are done with malicious intent to make trans people feel uncomfortable and unsafe this is a breach of conduct and with a proper report can be seriously reprimanded
Thaaaaats harassment.
They woulda got cussed the f out . I woulda went ape on them . Like nah. Alll of you are getting cussed tf out. Like first you. Stfu bitch. Get the fick away from me. Touch me and all you mfs are getting your face knocked in . Make sure to go for cheap shots if they attack. The throat , stomach, break an ankle or two if needed. You‚Äôd be surprised how easy it breaks if you hit it the right way. Only use self defense tho, never be the aggressor. You have a better case if it‚Äôs you vs a bunch of them . It‚Äôs obviously a case of bullying. You might come out alittle bruised but make sure they come out worse
That‚Äôs crossing the line into illegal in many countries! Ha, laws being enforced in circumstances that helps trans people. Like that‚Äôll ever happen.
Only once have i used a public restroom in the last 6 years, solely out of necessity at a busy theme park, and i was absolutely terrified the entire time.
Hasn't happened to me, but was a big fear for a long time.
This is absolutely horrible and I‚Äôm so sorry you went through that
i dont know any of their names
I agree! This is very severe, and not some ‚Äòharmless‚Äô pranking that can be dismissed. It‚Äôs deliberate bullying and these girls ought to be suspended, if not expelled."	zrpx6h	trans	87	0.95	2022-12-21 15:12:37
finally had a heart to heart with my dad	"He still doesn't know I'm trans, but we talked about being less judgemental and more accepting ""of my style"".

I've grown my hair out to about my shoulders, and a while back I painted my nails for a bit, And he lost it, told me I looked like a fag, that I'm embarrassing him in public, and it's weirding out the family, and that I need to quit bc it makes me look gay.

Good stuff, so I quit for a while, didn't cut my hair, but I quit painting my nails, I quit wearing jewelry he deemed as over the top, and I quit wearing my favorite color, which has been pink since I was like, conceived.

About 2 weeks ago at this point, I went on a trip to Colorado by myself and thought, ""I'm not even going to be around him, I'm gonna dress how I like""

So I packed my favorite clothes, and painted my nails, and headed off for the airport.

When I was on the flight back, I decided that it made me too happy to, scramble to the bathroom so he didn't see when I got home, and take off the polish, so I didn't and I finally talked to him, and was up front and told him, if you keep this up you're going to lose me, I'm not a doll you can dress up how you want. I told him that when he called me a f*ggot it really hurt, coming from my dad, and honestly his embarrassment is not my problem, and he needs to overcome that. He seemed somewhat receptive, and I haven't heard a word about it since.

There's an old analogy around here people use

Put a spring between your fingers and loosely hold it, and it'll stay with you, put pressure on it, and when you even slightly let up that pressure it'll spring away

And it really rings true, I wish parents understood that."	"Keep being you, OP
 I wish you all the best in your journey. But as harsh as it may sound and is, in my experience either they will understand and support you in time or they won‚Äôt and you can‚Äôt let that get in the way of who you are and need to express yourself as. Obviously if you aren‚Äôt safe, that‚Äôs another story.
I'm sorry to hear that your dad is such a douchebag, but i wish you the best"	ummdd8	trans	86	0.96	2022-05-10 16:15:14
Got a transphobe fired today, that was fun :)	"There‚Äôs a new girl at work who is trans, I haven‚Äôt actually met her yet but I have seen her a few times. Anyway this older guy saw her and went on a tirade to me,he dosnt know I‚Äôm trans because I‚Äôm male passing, unfortunately.He was going on and on about how she‚Äôs discussing and ugly (I think she‚Äôs kinda cute actually but whatever) I let him go on for a bit before turning to him and telling him off. he then said ‚Äúwell, if I see ‚Äúher‚Äù going into the woman‚Äôs bathroom I‚Äôm going to pull her out and beat the shit out of him‚Äù three seconds later the manager walks around the corner. Apparently he was in the other isle and heard everything the old man said and he fired him on the spot for threatening harm to a coworker. 

You can take your bigotry and shove it old man!"	"Can we somehow give him a Reddit award for exposing what a true disrespectful, bigoted person he is, and letting his belief system diatribe come out, at the perfect moment to be heard and fired for it???

And your manager gets an award too, for doing the right thing, and having the correct morality... yayyyy manager!
Hell to the yeah
This made my day
This brings me much joy, thank you
""if she goes into the woman's toilet, I'm also going in there to assault a woman, because that's what my bigoted dumb dumb brain thinks trans women do, so I'll do it as well.""
Another one bites the dust :D
First of all that‚Äôs awesome. It‚Äôs sad that I am sinacle assuming that that ass-hat won‚Äôt learn his lesson.  I am closeted still. And I have had instances where cis people made ‚Äúcomments‚Äù about trans people at work. It is so hard and painful. When I hear it I get angry but it also fills me with fear and doubt about my own transition and fearing I will be the subject of that ridicule- no matter how slight. Being closeted, I fear outing myself defending them but I can‚Äôt not say anything so I say something wimpy out of my own fears. So it sticks. I hate them for it and I hate myself for not having courage to defend other trans people. Sometimes life is difficult.

\*shameless promotion of /r/gendoors, for other such humorous signs*
Honest question: do people think urinals should be in unisex bathrooms? I think a room of single stalls, some with traditional toilets and some with urinals is probably the way to go. But I don't know if I would be comfortable sharing a room with traditional non stall urinals.
<3 So awesome
Stop with those puns :D
There should be urinals for the simple reason i've noticed the traditionally men's bathroom if it doesn't have one is the dirtiest thing ever. But if they have one or two the stalls are immaculately clean. Just my experiance. "	4shc92	trans	83	0.98	2016-07-12 14:46:13

Found out my parents are totally transphobic :/	"My brother brought up the fact that Quidditch players are now calling themselves ‚ÄôQuadballers‚Äô to distance themselves from J. K. Rowling (which, for the record, I think is pretty badass) at the dinner table, then my mom proceeded to ask what J. K. did you deserve the hate. I said she was a TERF but ofc no one knew what that was so I had to explain it. 

For background, I come from a religious conservative family. My dad has said that he doesn‚Äôt care if ppl find their identity or not, he just hates that it‚Äôs ‚Äòforced onto children‚Äô. My mom usually is just one of those ppl that has an issue with trans women goin to the bathroom and physically cannot wrap her mind around gender-neutral pronouns and neopronouns (I think her brain would explode if she heard abt xenopronouns) 

Anyway, by the end of what was probably around an hour-long conversation, I came away with the fact that my parents will only call a trans person by their gender if they add the -trans suffix (ex. TRANS woman or a TRANS man. Never just a man or a woman) and that they fell insulted (for lack of a better word) that they would have to refer to them as such.

I always knew that the where a bit transphobic but never this much. It just hurts so much to know that I‚Äôll never be able to truly be myself around my family. I wish it could be different but I know deep in my heart that this will never change. It just sucks"	"Hey, I was in your shoes before. 

My parents, my mom in particular, felt pretty much the exact same way about trans people. It only was intensified after I came out. There were months of screaming, of threatening, of accusing. Eventually, there was no choice but to settle down since that was their life now. I was their only kid. They didn't have to like I was trans, and by God did they let me know that. 

Years of passive aggressive behavior and comments, name calling, ruined family functions. Slowly, but surely, they came around. 6 years, it took them, but after those 6 years my mom was right by my side, touching my face as I woke up from top surgery. She changed my drains, took care of me like she did when I was a kid, and I felt loved again. I don't know why my top surgery was the turning point, but now they are my biggest allies. I promise you, if your parents love you, they will learn to love ALL of you. It takes time and work, but you don't have to feel hopeless.
That sounds really really painful, wow. It is not at all comparable, but as someone seeing creators I like come out as genuinely transphobic, it‚Äôs really painful. Seeing someone who inspired me or who I cared about come to life in such a horrible way rips me apart, it‚Äôs not the same, but knowing someone that made you you would never accept the real person you are is a seriously devastating thing.
How can you have again that relationship without being bitter? It seems like a loooot of patience.
These are such encouraging words. I haven't told my parents anything and I'm terrified of losing them as I have a great relationship with them. I've been on HRT for a month now, so before too long it won't be easy to hide how I'm changing and presenting myself. I'm so scared. But your story gives me hope that I will still have the loving connection with them once we get all the conversations that need to happen over with. Thank you.

HELL YEA DUDE!! It is a big scary step but it helps so much (or atleast did for me)!
Same. Bathrooms are honestly the most confusing aspect of transitioning for me, of course only due to the way people treat them
Just stay strong. You‚Äôll do it someday. Good luck :D

My dad is awesome!	"(MTF)
My dad took me out to buy women's clothes which is awesome. It's also my first time presenting female in public, and he said that he would be there to protect me if anyone gets transphobic. Also today was the my first time using the women's bathroom. So far no one was weird or transphobic, or at least that I can notice. It does help that I'm wearing a mask, but I'm happy."	"Thanks for sharing this! I've also started wearing women's clothing recently but somehow I'm still scared to enter the women's restroom. :-(

Beautiful, I am so happy for you!
That's awesome! I'm so happy for you!
im so glad that you are able to be out and free well done to you girl!!

I did it.	I went into the men's bathroom and did my thing for the first time. It was several hours ago now and I'm not so excited I'm talking in full caps but I'm just so happy I sucked it up and did it.

Nice job! We are all really proud of you, and don‚Äôt feel bad for feeling awkward. In 20+ years of public bathrooms I have never had a non-awkward interaction with cis men so don‚Äôt sweat it. Again, you‚Äôre awesome.

Ask stupid questions...	"I came out just over a year ago. My dad and I have this game where he pretends I'm not trans, and I pretend that his outright rejection doesn't bother me. A year ago, when I first asked him to use my correct pronouns, he just replied, ""no."" I politely reminded him of my pronouns once, a few months later. This time he said, ""how about I just don't refer to you at all."" 

I've made peace with that. Being myself has brought me so much joy, and his disapproval is just a small disappointment. But it seems like he's under the misconception that if he's passive aggressive enough, I'll stop being trans. Asking my sister why she doesn't call me ""she."" Asking me why my friends don't call me by my birth name. 

And today when we were shopping and he saw me coming out of the bathroom. ""Why were you in the men's room?"" he asked. 

""The usual reason."" I had to pee. 

His response, predictably, was to sigh and walk away. Maybe one day he'll realize that his lame attempts at confrontation aren't going to change anything. 

Not today, sadly."	"Wow he sounds like such a prick. You're super strong for how you're handling it and recognizing that the joy you get from being yourself outweighs the pain that his behavior brings ‚ò∫Ô∏è

Shower thoughts: trans men	"So when you start to transition one of the most ‚Äúexciting‚Äù parts is using the preferred bathroom. And for trans fems it‚Äôs fine because we can just sit, but trans masc can‚Äôt use the urinal. It just pissed me off. Have a great day everyone!‚ù§Ô∏è

I just want to say I love this community you all are amazing, thanks for being incredible human beings!"	"Honestly if I was using the wrong bathroom and saw a guy squat in the urinal that‚Äôd just be another day in the office
as a trans man who has started using the correct bathroom: I do not want to stand at urinal, I would prefer to stand at a toilet or just sit, because I find urinals to be a weird concept in general. I understand tho lmao
If it‚Äôs any relief, I, a transfem, have only ever used a urinal once in my life
There are some packers my friend (transmasc) was telling me about where they try to let you stand and pee but idk how well they actually work
Standing at a urinal is overrated anyways. If you don't sit when you pee you're doing it the hard way. üòòüéâ
I‚Äôd just go to normal toilet and say I have to take a shit
i don't know a single person who would willingly use a urinal
Trans masc, I always sit and make sure I'm confusing someone in the rr
I use stalls no matter what because I'm blatter shy and using a stall makes me slightly more comfortable so it's better to just sit down.
Ya know, you‚Äôre not wrong
Honestly they are kinda weird, have you seen the ones with no stall and just a long like metal thing. Who can do that lol
I used to a lot because I hated the men‚Äôs stalls, women‚Äôs are a lot cleaner I‚Äôve found out üòÖ
Yeah, but STP's don't pack well. It's either you can pee and it looks like you constantly have a boner, or you buy a packer and a stp and hope nobody notices you switching them out
The more you know
Relax a bit right
I‚Äôve heard that a lot
I mean you have a point but I just feel bad for my trans brothers
As a soon to be trans / nb fem I can say with certainty that a lot of men use urinals but me personally I've always felt that to be gross. I'd rather wait 10 minutes for a stall to be free than using one of those smelly things where you can't wipe afterwards
You my friend have obviously never been to a 5 days long metal festival where every toilet is a moshpit on its own :P
We love messing with the cis üòÇ
Understandable
You need the correct packing underwear my guy, and I think you‚Äôre mistaken on how often cis men take a look at another mans gonads in the urinal because no one has ever noticed my stp
Some penis havers are showers instead of growers

Does anyone else just enjoy the processes of getting pretty?	Im pre hrt/ pre committing so i spend most of my week as a male. However on fridays, ill shave my face, and my body. Ill take a long shower and then ill dry my hair and style it femininely. Later i. The night when everyone goes to bed ill excitedly throw on a cute outfit and sneak into the bathroom and put on some makeup. I love the excitement of just getting ready. I often think about/ feel like a girl getting ready to go out with her friends to the bar on a friday night or something.	"I wish I could feel like that again, but when you do it daily it becomes so tedious
Funny your mention this. I was taking a shower this evening after getting back from the gym, and as I was shaving my legs, I remembered my first time ever.  It was such a thrill and felt like I was getting away with something. Since then I‚Äôve shaved them so many times I couldn‚Äôt even venture a guess as to how many. But nearly every time still feel like ‚ÄúWow, I can‚Äôt believe I finally get to do this!‚Äù Ahhh!  üòå
Same for me just getting ready in it self makes me excited and super happy. But I'm starting to do it during the week as well, I go to work with makeup on ect. I even out right now getting dinner, in femme clothes makeup and have a bra with toilet paper

Intrusive thoughts	"Broke down in school a few days ago, cried silently to myself in the middle of class for 10-15 mins during a test and nobody noticed because I‚Äôve grown my hair out long enough to cover my face. Eventually asked if I could go to the bathroom where I washed my face. This was all because the voices in my head screaming at me that I‚Äôm not worth anything, I should hurt myself and the people around me, more garbage like that which I can ignore pretty easily until I start to believe it. For context, this happens often but I don‚Äôt react to it most the time. I constantly struggle with wanting to be myself to be happy but fearful I‚Äôll hurt the people close to me by being someone they don‚Äôt think I am, or if I should keep living life as the person everyone else thinks I am that I‚Äôve put on for years and continuing to feel miserable. I‚Äôve wanted to kill myself since I was 8 before I even knew I was transfemme but I know it‚Äôd hurt my family and I don‚Äôt want that. I don‚Äôt want to hurt anyone anymore, I just want to be happy but I‚Äôm scared I‚Äôm gonna tear my family apart I don‚Äôt know what to do.

I feel like saying anything else would be too much, I hate venting as it is but this is the first time I‚Äôve wanted to cry for help instead of bottling it all in, I‚Äôm sorry."	"You are an amazing and wonderful person, we care about you, hope this helps
You are sports to have feelings, and voices suck.

So you have a parent you can come to? A teacher? Any mentor or counselor? It's important to talk to someone shit these things, even if it is one of the hardest things to do. 

It's important to have someone at an anchor that can help you through these times.
Intrusive thoughts are difficult, I totally get it. Have you considered talking about any of these things with a therapist? You don't have to bottle it all up alone. I'm not sure about your local laws, but with HIPAA (in the US) your parents typically aren't allowed to know what is talked about during a session.
It does, I really appreciate it a lot. It‚Äôs a struggle to grasp the idea that I‚Äôm more than just a burden on someone but this helps ;^;
Out to my sister and some people at school that‚Äôs about it, I don‚Äôt like venting to people often though I feel selfish and like I‚Äôm making everything about myself. Thank you for the advice though, I‚Äôll see what I can do ^^
Your not alone I think most of us think we are useless and just a burden on everyone
Venting can be tough but it can be soooooo helpful! 

Having someone you can talk about these things is good, because when things get rough you won't have the energy to find someone. Establish those support people.

You can do this. You're tougher, stronger, more stubborn than those bastard voices. Kick their ass."	ua83ts	trans	61	0.96	2022-04-23 15:39:26

Even Cis Males get Misgendered Sometimes	"So I was trying to find a way to phrase the title because I wanted to make sure it came across the right way. I am a fairly short guy, I have soft features especially when I shave, a delicate voice that apparently sounds *super* feminine over the phone so I'm constantly getting called mam, and long flowing hair that made another guy laugh himself out of the bathroom because he thought  ""a woman was in there"". I totally get how upsetting and hurtful it is to hear people make off-handed comments about your gender like ""Bro I thought you were a girl"" (I seriously wanted to clock the guy for being so insulting for no reason) and I just wanted to let people that are ""trying to pass as male"" know that it can even happen to Cis-Males too so you're not alone and it doesn't make you less valid. I hope this is coming across the right way because it can be a little embarassing to talk about. üò∂"	"Yes! I know that so many of us really care about passing (I used to too) but sometimes there‚Äôs nothing more we can do and it‚Äôs just the other person being wrong
Oh my gosh this! Im MtF and ive been called ma'am more times in full on guy mode, with nothing fem about me (that i know of anyways lol) aaaaand i'm like wait.....wut? Lllol just a little bit of a mindfu#k tbh. So yep, to confirm OP's post, yes, it really does happen. And im sorry that jackass was like that to you man, that sucks. Kudos to you for not popping him one lol. Keep on being you brother man!
Thanks OP. Can confirm my cis sib gets similar comments for his beautiful hair and soft features.
I was misgendered here and there for years when I was attempting to be a man. 

The fact that not only did it not bother me, but it made me happy, should have been a clue for me! Sadly, I have a fairly male face - I‚Äôm REALLY hoping the estrogen fairy hits it hard and makes me look pretty!
Ive seen so many times in customer service, girl co workers get misgendered. Cis people dont always pass and Some people just treat being a man as the default and will call everyone a man.
""the other person being wrong"" this needs to be said like 1000x times more. the sheer accuracy of that statement.
That's true. I'm a cis male who on the phone has a high voice and have been called Miss quite often, and two or three times in person.

Having depression and a minority complex, it always hurts me, because I'd like to be perceived as more handsome /manly.  But as you said, it's the other person being wrong.
You know speaking of girls in customer service. The one thing that gave me joy to no end about being misgendered as a girl is when my TEENAGE coworkers used to tell me that certain old dudes were creeping on them so I would go and handle them. They would see my hair and go ""Oh you have such pretty hair üòç"" and it would give me ample opportunity to go ""THANKS YOU TOO BRO"" in the deepest voice I can manage. The instant regret on their faces was always hilarious üòÇ
XD, ive always had a really femme voice and used to pass on the phone all the time, but pre transition i was a large hairy dude with a full beard. it was funny af whenever a customer would come and in say, tell that lady shes was really nice and she made my day, and i was the only one allowed to use the phone. my totally cis ass would be beaming."	renggr	trans	55	0.92	2021-12-12 11:47:29
Some anxiety venting	"I have been questioning if i was a trans woman for a few years now, i am relatively certain but my anxieties and mental health has been holding me back in regard to my friends. The majority of my friends (who i love and are great and accepting people) are women, and have been their whole life, they are great but it is always minor things that trigger me into spirals, such as them all going to the girls bathroom and me feeling left behind. I haven't felt right in my birth gender before i met them but i can't shake the feeling that if i tell them i think i am trans i know they will accept me but i don't think my mind will let that happen. It will be constant dragging thought of me knowing deep down they still see me as a guy, and everyone who i would have known before i would transition would always see me as the person i so fucking hate. 

Extremely sorry if this is out of place in this community, if so please remove this post, otherwise any advice or knowledge on these thoughts would be extremely appreciated, thank you."

"TW: My boyfriend's parents (50s) were peeping at me (22f) while I was using the bathroom to see if I was a ""real girl"" and once they saw that I'm trans, they humiliated me and started pressurising my boyfriend (24m) to break up with me."	"My boyfriend took me to his house for us to meet his parents for Christmas. My boyfriend's parents and I had quite a bad start because our very first conversation was them asking me if I was a girl. I haven't had my ffs done yet so I might still have a face that looks a little masculine even with my make-up on. I told them that I am a girl and they would ask me weirder questions like ""are you sure you're a girl? Are you a real girl? Etc"", which made me very uncomfortable, but somehow I got out of it. So they finally sent me and my boyfriend to our room for us to freshen up where I told my boyfriend how uncomfortable I felt. My boyfriend went down to get me snacks and I went to the washroom to freshen up. So I was peeing and all of a sudden I saw that the door was slightly open and I could see my boyfriend's mom. They had literally unlocked the bedroom door, came in and unlocked the bathroom door just to peep at me (I had locked both doors). I got up from the toilet immediately after seeing her and the lady just walked in and apologised to me and said that she just came in because she wanted to give me a soap and some towels to use. The dad was also right there inside the bedroom and they both apologised to me for just coming inside. It was one of the most horrible and uncomfortable experiences for me ever.

I later told this to my boyfriend and he told me that his parents might have genuinely come inside just to give me the towels and soap and he told me that I might be overthinking and I should probably just forget it. After Christmas day, during breakfast, my boyfriend's parents just straight up told us that they didnt like me and that they'd prefer my boyfriend to stay away from me. My boyfriend was pissed and argued with his parents but they were just going on humiliating me by saying things like ""I want my son to be with a real woman"" and they went as far as to say that they want someone who can give their son a child and that I can never be a mother. I just couldn't take it anymore and I just got up and went to the bedroom to pack my things and leave, but my boyfriend insisted that he would come with me because he can't leave me alone, but the parents walked inside the room again and told my boyfriend that they wanted him to stay at home till new year's and they wanted me to leave alone. My boyfriend still packed his bags and left with me and we're now living in a hotel room, but my boyfriend's parents call him thrice everyday and tell him to come back home and to leave me, and they always humiliate me and degrade me. My boyfriend told me that he's under a lot of pressure and he wants some time alone, so he packed his bags and went back home last night. I haven't stopped crying since and after relapsing and cutting myself multiple times on my wrist and contemplating suicide, I've booked a train to my hometown for this afternoon and I don't know where I'll go from there. I just wanted to vent to someone and I don't have many friends and none who'd even wanna listen to me (except my boyfriend but I don't have him now too). I'm just done with life at this point. Thanks for listening to me I guess."	"This is one of the worst things I have ever heard.

How the hell does anyone think any part of this is OK?

I'm so sorry for your experience, his family is the worst. You deserve someone who vehemently defends you and your happiness. I would absolutely block my mother's number if she did anything like this.
That's really toxic and unhealthy. You should dump him but please girl don't hurt yourself. He and his family are not worth all that. 

There is a transgender suicide hotline in the US now. You can reach Trans Lifeline at 877-565-8860.
Do you need someone to chat with? You can dm me at anytime
This is horrific behavior by the parents and, though he responded correctly at first, it sounds like your boyfriend is not handling their pressure well. He should have cut them off, not keep responding at this time. 

I‚Äôm so sorry that any of thjs has happened to you. But PLEASE DO NOT HARM YOURSELF ANYMORE. Please do not kill yourself. You are an amazing person who deserves to be loved. You are special and unique and cannot be replaced.

Is there anyone in your life you can call? Anyone you can be with? Any support numbers in your country that you can call?

This is horrible and awful but not forever. You can find happiness in this life still.
Omg this is such a nightmare and so fucked up I honestly don‚Äôt know where to start.

First off, your boyfriends parents sexually harassed/assaulted you. Peeking in on someone going to the bathroom with the intent of seeing their genitals is so fucked up on so many levels but because it was them trying to find out if you were trans make it so much worse. On top of that your boyfriend is a jerk for gaslighting you when you brought it up to him as a huge red flag. I think he may be as toxic as his family.

It‚Äôs clear that your boyfriend is no longer a safe person for you. He is ok with his parents harassing and dehumanizing you right in from of him and even finds it normal. He left you after his parents tore your world apart and traumatized you. Like seriously, I‚Äôm sorry but fuck this guy he sucks so bad.

All that being said, get yourself safe and stay safe. When people give you a reason to fear for your safety it‚Äôs time to go. We don‚Äôt get a lot of second chances.
Jesusfuckingchrist they are awful people and I am sorry you had to deal with that. I am so sorry. Be safe.
I'm really sorry you experienced this. This is unacceptable behavior from the parents and you shouldn't have had to go through that. If you would like somebody else to talk to, let me know.
Jesus, I have so many things to say, but let's start with; how are you?

I haven't lived what you've gone through, but I do have similar thoughts. Hope you're at least doing decent. Maybe even okay? If you want to, I'm here to talk.
They are damn lucky it was you and not me because this girl would‚Äôve straight up beat their old asses down
That sucks.

People are here for you.

Hope you have somewhere safe to go, please reach out if you don't
If you need someone to talk to! I‚Äôm here! Trans man who is here to support anyone who needs it!
And he was doing so well too... WHY THE FUCK WOULD HE GO BACK!!?!?!?!?
jfc that's awful with the peeping and i hope my in-laws haven't done that but they know im trans and blatantly call
me a man to my boyfriend. i fucking hate them so much and i feel like they're winning him away from me.

deadnamed publicly at school:( anything i can do?	"i am out at school/ partially stealth. all the teachers know (at least they should be aware), i use the girls bathroom, and everyone calls me my preferred name. (no one, besides staff and friends knows it)i‚Äôm sure students can tell i‚Äôm trans or at least not cisgender because of my voice but outside of that i pass. 

today i had my dead name broadcasted through the intercom to go home. (my school doesnt do this period, i have no idea why they did it this time) my friends immediately turned to me and mumbled in shock. 

once i got home i cried of embarrassment and shame. is there anything i can even do? the teacher who manages the intercom constantly dead names and disrespects my pronouns. i played it off as her not liking me, which is fine. she‚Äôs old, i don‚Äôt let it get to me. but this is too far. any advice???"	"Wow, is there a school counselor you could go to? Maybe they could work it out? I don't know what the situation is in TX, but my school had counselors.
I live in Houston too, unfortunately. It's supposed to be the second most progressive city in Texas, but it's still just a flaming pile of shit. Anyway, I'd say talk to your principal if you can. They'd be pretty much the only person who could do anything about that teacher. If not, sadly the best course of action is probably to just lay low and keep your head down. The recent wave of anti-trans legislation puts you and your family in serious danger if the teacher decides to make a stink. I'm sorry hun, but I know you'll get through this. Us transfems are a resilient lot. Good luck. Stay safe :)
i live in htx btw!
the counselor that was actually easy to approach just left:( but i‚Äôll definitely see the other one tysm
Ofc you know your school better than me, but is it possible that it‚Äôs a mistake with their system and not intended abusively? Could she just have an incorrect name sheet that could be updated if you ask the principal‚Äôs office?

I have such a weakness for interesting bathroom aesthetics. Back in the day when I used to frequent the Japanese restaurant itsu! here, they were always dimly lit and gender-neutral, and.. Is it bad that the toilets were a motivation for me to go there?  


Looking really pretty, your glasses suit you so well!
This place was oddly gender neutral, a bunch of WC (water closet) labeled stalls with just a toilet inside, and the one ‚Äúdicks only‚Äù stall with a urinal inside. Lol completely un-gendered, very inclusive. "	as7edw	trans	48	0.93	2019-02-19 06:32:49
Today was fucking amazing /g (FtM, 15, He/They)	"Two of my friends, M and R (both cis men and bi) and I (pre-t ftm) hung out tonight at M's church for a youth event. M and R aren't out to their parents yet, but M's parents are very supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. Well, in the car, I told M's mom that I'm trans and asked her to please call me he. She was like ""Okay!"". Then at the church youth event I had the courage to basically out myself to the event members. Even though you could obviously see I had tits, everyone respected my name and pronouns. I also met another LGBTQ person! They are awesome /g

I even got to use the men's bathroom! And when I told the head of the event that if she ever talks to my parents, don't tell them that I said my name is Elliott and she was also like ""Okay!"".

On top of that, I may be seeing my boyfriend for the first time in over a month tomorrow! M, R, and I are going to the movies and my boyfriend may be joining us.

I'm literally so fucking happy right now, which is something I've had a lot of trouble with recently. I am a happy little trans boy :]"	"This sounds so awesome dude! Have fun at the movies!
That took an incredible amount of courage, and I'm so glad that your efforts were well received and richly rewarded! Congrats, dude!

A farewell letter to my breasts - my surgery is Wednesday.	"I'm attached to my boobs, I'll admit. I cannot remember what it was like before I had them. I am nervous I may change my mind, I am nervous I will hate the result, I am nervous about the procedure and about the road to recovery. But I have been waiting six years for this moment, I have been so sure up until now, I know it's *just nerves* and I'll be happy once I'm through it.

To cope, I've written a letter to my breasts, and I'd like to share it.

Dear Tiddays

You were tasteful and looked great in a dress. For a while, I did not hate you. But you are a hindrance to my endeavors, I am uncomfortable around you. I cannot be there to support you on a daily basis when you keep getting us pulled out of bathrooms and prevent me from wearing shirts that fit. So you must leave. I wish you the best in your future bio-hazardous waste disposal bag. 

Best wishes,
Apollo

PS. I'm sorry I never named you, but you should never name something you might have to kill. "	"It was the breast of times, it was the worst of times
Congrats on the top surgery! Hope everything goes well!
Honestly, don‚Äôt be nervous about regretting it. The nice things about boobs is that if you want them back, yo can get implants and have them back. But it sounds like that won‚Äôt be an issue for you at all. I hope it goes well for you!!
Oh hey I have an enby/possibly ftm I was never really sure friend also named Apollo! Best of luck man, good luck fitting in affirming clothes afterwards
It's soon to be a ""Dick""ens of the times. 
Gods bless you.
It went down without a hitch and I'm doing very well now. Thanks!!
Everything went great! I can't really tell the difference right now with all the gauze and the vest, but I definitely don't regret it.
hahaha, right now i can't put much on besides baggy zip-up sweaters, but at least i have an excuse to me shirtless 85% of the time already."	9awije	trans	44	0.93	2018-08-28 06:18:47
My parents accept me as trans, and this happened today	Just before father's day, my dad finally called me his son. I've been out to them as ftm and on T for about 6 months, but this is the first time they've really acknowledged it. I went to a Walmart bathroom with my dad, and after we walked out, he said he had stayed behind a bit just in case anyone in there decided to start shit with me. I could have cried. I just had to share this somewhere because I'm really happy.	"Wholesome :)

I‚Äôm trans (male to female). Which bathroom do I use if I go somewhere?		"Whichever one is safest and most comfortable for you to use that time. If it‚Äôs worth the risk to go into the girls bathroom then that is good, but sometimes it‚Äôs not safe depending on where you are
[removed]
Are you with other women?  That definitely will increase your safety if you feel like people will try some
Whichever you feel safest in. And if you get glares just ignore it. Love you darling
Women's room typically.
That's up to you. If you head to the men's room and A man points you to the ladies room then I guess you pass.
Whichever one you feel more safe and comfortable in
Which ever has the shorter line
I also have the same problem but im 14... any help anyone?
Wherever you damn well please as long as you feel safe!
I always use female one.
Whichever you pass as at the time
I say use whichever you‚Äôre comfortable with. And consider if anyone is in said bathroom so you don‚Äôt have to deal with any bullshit (well that‚Äôs advice for anyone in general.) at the end of the day, you‚Äôre just there to do your business, anyone who makes a huge fuss over it is an asshole and a half
Go to where you feel is safest and most comfortable- when I‚Äôm out I‚Äôll sneak into the males - but if family is by I‚Äôll go to woman‚Äôs üòÖ
Do what makes most sense.  
If you pass and live and present as a woman, go into the women's.  
If you still don't, go into the men's.
whichever makes you more comfortable ‚ù§Ô∏èüôÉ
Let‚Äôs say I‚Äôm in America and I go to a restaurant. They don‚Äôt have a family bathroom and I‚Äôm wearing a dress and everything. What do I do?
Yes
No, I‚Äôm alone, though I wish I wasn‚Äôt.
Thanks
Uh
You should be okay. Like as long as you l look the part you should just go to the bathroom of your gender identity with no problem. especially if you‚Äôre young since it isn‚Äôt as difficult to pass at that age. Just make try to have a couple of friends around to have your back
Women's.
It fully depends on your comfort level, I‚Äôd say if you‚Äôre ready to be out and it‚Äôs a more liberal area, feel free to use the women‚Äôs restroom, if it‚Äôs not, evaluate the risks and see what you‚Äôd prefer

Also if youre wearing a dress it might be safer to use the women‚Äôs anyway
I feel you , at that point I‚Äôd try to read the room and environment you‚Äôre in to see which is safer at the time.  What part of America?
thanks
Around the Michigan area
Hello! Fellow(?) Michigander here!

Depends on the part of Michigan. Most big cities and the suburbs around Detroit (until you get into Livingston County or up into Macomb) are going to be pretty safe. 

Outside, hit and miss. 

If you're full time and in a dress, I don't see much issue one way or another. You'll find most Midwesterners are very anti-confrontational. It'll be about confidence, if you're acting nervous and like you're up to something, it'll raise alarm bells. Be mindful of your surroundings.
Probably safe to do so in Michigan; Blue state.
Ehhhhhhhhhhhhh...

It's a purple state with a large, often socially conservative, ""working class"" base.

I know because I live and work here. There are definitely places that are ""very accepting"" of trans people, and there are places where it's going to be ""well, it depends""."	ogw3xu	trans	48	0.95	2021-07-09 13:58:10
My experience in the bathrooms as a trans person. (TW for Harassment)	"At the beginning of 7th grade I identified as a trans boy, (though I now identify as Agender) and 7th grade was the worst year for me. 
Ever.
There was this boy who I will refer to him as J. 
J would always ask me personal and uncomfortable questions about my gender. Stuff like, ‚Äúdo you use the guys bathroom?‚Äù ‚ÄúDo you have a pen*s?‚Äù ect. 
Mind you this was in 7th grade, I was 13 at the time. And now I‚Äôm going into 8th grade as a 14 year old. 
J would usually bark and meow at me in the halls, along with his friends. Though there was this one thing that I experienced that would basically change me forever.

I talked to the school counselor about me being trans, and whether or not I could be allowed to use the mens bathroom. She said that it was fine for me to use it, and that if anyone had a problem with it then they should report to her. 
Well, this one time during study prep, I went into the boys bathroom and went into a stall. And I checked the ground underneath the stall to see if there was anyone in there with me.
There was. 
It was a guy who was over by the sinks, and he must‚Äôve seen me peak underneath the stall, I quickly stood up and stood completely still. 
The guy yelled if there was anyone else in there, that‚Äôs when another guy came in, and then another. 
And then about 8 boys came in, probably grades 8th-11th, surrounding my stall and banging on the sides, throwing wadded up wet paper towels over the stall, yelling, yelling me to come out.
I stood completely still, and decided to just go on my phone in hopes they would leave me alone if I just didn‚Äôt reply. That‚Äôs when 2 boys had shoved their phones underneath the stall.
Now, luckily my pants were up, but then I heard a familiar voice come into the bathrooms. It was J.
I overheard J tell the boys who I was. 
And the boys got more aggressive. 
But after a while they left. 

I had told the counselor about what happened, and the counselor decided to tell my parents. 

That night I was threatened by my mom that if I were to use the guys bathroom that I would either 
1) be kicked out
2) be beaten
My parents didn‚Äôt say anything else about the boys, instead they were blaming me for the situation 


All thanks to J. 

So J. If you‚Äôre reading this, I just hope that you‚Äôre aware of what you did. And that I hope you learn from it and to never terrorize anyone like that again. 

I hope that this story proves that trans people are not ones to be feared. We should break the stigma surrounding trans people and learn to love each other for who we are."	"That's so awful to deal with at your age. Especially to have your parents victim blame right afterwards. 

I've had issues with harassment in the bathroom, but that's in public and I was 20. I couldn't imagine dealing with something like that at your age. 

The way you describe this I feel like you're a very strong person. No one can change what you've experienced and what has happened to you through your transition, but the way you reflect on it and recount it is admirable. 

Im really sorry you had to go through this. I just hope it can be a chance to add depth to your character as you overcome these challenges. You have our support here 100%!
I‚Äôm so sorry you had to go through that experience at school, and then have such a horrible response at home. Were you out to your parents prior to this? If not, I feel like your counselor should have asked you if it was okay. They need to get J involved in this conversation first. This is bullying and most schools have zero-tolerance bullying rules to protect the students.

I teach 8th grade and I‚Äôve had a few trans students. I always ask my students if their parents know and if they support them. Kids are a lot more accepting here but bullying does still happen. We have many interventions that we can use before we get parents involved.

I really hope things get better for you. Remember that all teachers and all staff at schools are mandatory reporters (if you‚Äôre in the US). Any abuse that happens at school or at home, whether physical or emotional can and should be reported to someone you trust. Believe me when I say that most of your teachers care about you more than you know and want to get you the help you need.

Just got kicked out of mens bathroom	I wanna die. I go to bathroom only than no one‚Äôs around and I still got kicked out. Bruh	"That‚Äôs messed up.  I‚Äôm sorry.  You have the right to be there.
I don't know why people care soo much. I just want to pee. I don't give a fuck about you, so why do you give a fuck about me?
KICK EM IN THE BALLSSSS
Wow that's wild I'm sorry that happened
why don‚Äôt they just let u pee? seriously this makes me wanna go to the toilet so badüí™üíÄ
Gosh that sucks. 
As a trans man with a dissability it always made me wonder why non disabled folks make sutch a big deal of gendering there toilets when disabled folks just all use the same toilet without giving a duck.
I'm so sorry that happened to you, it's so disappointing and unnecessary.
I'm sorry that happened to you. You don't deserve this
Kicking someone out of the mens bathroom seriously violates the mens bathroom code of ""don't talk. don't make eye contact. be polite. get in get out and pretend you didn't see anyone else.""

And besides, you belong there.
Idk your thoughts and feels on the scenario, but tell them to ‚Äúfuck off and mind their own business. What are you, a groomer?‚Äù

‚ÄúWhy are you obsessed with genitals?‚Äù

‚ÄúPrivacy for thee, and not me, eh?‚Äù

‚ÄúSome Christ follower you are.‚Äù

‚ÄúScared the big bad trans man is gonna rape a helpless cis man? Really? That‚Äôs where we are at now?‚Äù

‚ÄúWho the fuck you talking to?‚Äù

Anyway - I‚Äôve used those a few times. I‚Äôve had good luck - but your safety is priority one - 

Regardless, I‚Äôm sorry you went through that.
I'm so sorry, that's not right for them to do that...
You werent doing anything wrong, you were just using the bathroom, people are just nosey it seems.

Hello, Im Max (FTM) and I could really use some help... :D	"Hi hello! I'm a 16 y/o (FTM) in very desperate need of help. I just wanna know how I bring up the fact I want to use the men's bathroom, be in the men's locker room, and be in boys P.E., I just feel really dysphoric not being in such places and constantly being around girls and being reminded of the fact I am one. I have all the essentials,  Athletic tape for my chest, a packer, and personality as a man, so I don't think ill stand out too much... I'm not doing it for sexual reasons I'm 100 percent asexual, and I want it to seem that it isn't.  


Any tips? I would be in your favor :D"	"I would maybe try talking with your teacher about it. Your Homeroomteacher or some sort of Trustteacher from the standpoint of not feeling good in the girls lockerroom?
Hope you live in a tolerant place- if you do your principal should understand that request.
Use caution utilizing athletic tape and certainly not ace wrap bandages for your chest. Be careful and enjoy PE. I would say enjoy being in the correct changing room but I hated it and always felt awkward.
Have you come out to your parents? They would be your best allies when advocating for yourself. If your parents are not supportive do you have a close friend who could back you up? I find the best way to tackle any difficult situation is not to do it alone.

Good luck & take care ‚ù§‚ù§
You'll need the school administration on your side. Ultimately, you'll have to go through your principal. I say this as someone who was the reason they established transgender policies in a southern, but sort of progressive, school. I would start with the school counselor. That's what I did. Then, it moved to administration. I did this for also my vocational school.
First off it doesn't matter about sexuality here, just ask your teacher or go to the office and tell them the situation, they'll be accomodating
Yeah, I think that would be the best option. Thanks alot :D
Ill try and ask him, I just hope it doesn't have to go through the principal lol, and I do somewhat, so Ill ask around :D, thank you
Oh yeah of course, I know how to properly use it! and yeah ill never use ace tape, it's really bad for you lol, thank you!
my dad isn't supportive, but I do have a close friend who is! but what would my friend do if I can ask? isn't this a closed situation between me and the school for confidentiality reasons? not trying to sound mean, just a bit confused :)
Also I wouldn't worry about sexuality here because being slightly coombrained as a young boy is perfectly normal due to the influence of testosterone, just keep it to yourself and you'll be fine
Alright, I was just confused cause I've seen a lot of people say that their teachers said it's cause they wanna ""snoop on boys"". but yeah, ill definitely do that, I appreciate the help!
Thank you right back and best of luck!  Depending on your country, province/state/prefecture there should be laws you can look up to support your needs. I hope you have an easy and wonderful time!
Honestly, probably nothing other than moral support. This sounds like something you'll need to talk to a teacher or principal about which can be very intimidating, especially considering how personally this affects you. If it were me I would be a whole lot more confident if I had a good friend there to support me. They should allow your friend to be there if you say you want them there.

If you want to prepare ahead of time, talk it over with your friend. What exactly do you want the school to do for you? Which staff member do you feel most comfortable approaching? What kinds of things might they ask you in return? What reasons might they give for denying you and do you have arguements against those points?

I should also say I only started transitioning as an adult, so my experiences will probably be quite different from what you experience. 

Good luck, hopefully this is helpful üòä

so upset (and drunk)	headass just cried for like 10 minutes in the bathroom because i‚Äôm not a woman. i haven‚Äôt thought about it in weeks and here i was thinking ‚Äúhey maybe i am cis after all‚Äù but after this i think it‚Äôs pretty clear i do not like being a man at all. i just feel so overwhelmed and i don‚Äôt know what to do.	"If you're a woman, you're a woman, doesn't matter what type of body you have(pre-op, no-op, pre-HRT, no-HRT). But I'm sorry you're feeling like that; I know dysphoria can be a real pain in the ass.
Honest it's such a difficult thing, I ditched my home state, avoid talking to family, and found a partner that loved me for the me in my head/heart. I was very lucky she is (in her words) borderline asexual, so that contributed to her lack of caring about how I identify or what body I'm in. 


It took me years to reconcile with the ""but how can I want to be more femme and also mostly be attracted to femme people, I must be faking it"". Buuuuuuuuut transbians are a thing and that just fell into every category I thought was impossible to put together. After a few months spiralling on trans/bian Twitter, I came out to my partner. Havent told my mom or family and am hopefully going to start feminizing hormone therapy I'm the next month. 


It's starts slow and eventually becomes a wave you can't stop. It's much easier (though not simpler) on you as a person if you accept who you are. Thats the biggest piece I can give you girl ‚ù§Ô∏è
God, I‚Äôm 20 months into HRT and 16 months living full time as a woman and yet I still have those moments. The thing is that it happens less often and the intensity has reduced. It takes time to mentally shift yourself from one gender to the other where it feels natural. It still feels awkward at times to say I‚Äôm a woman or pronoun myself correctly but it continues to get easier. Try not to feel so bad, you will get there in time.
Welcome to my world.  I been like this ever since i broke up with my fianc√© and told myself I'd never fall in love again.
I've gotten close to that point a couple of times. Fucking sucks. Every time I stop thinking for a while it's there. But some days are worse than others. At least you now have a memory to recall when you feel the impostor syndrome again.
thank you.
Hey, of course. As a trans man, I can't really give much useful, tangible advice here, but I'm more than happy to be a hype man for my trans sisters. (Also, we're both drunk, so, like, double-solidarity, y'know? lmao)

Anyone else feel like they still don't have any idea who they are?	I guess the title says it all really. I feel like I suppressed myself my entire life, and I never gave myself the chance to grow into stuff I liked or express interest in anything really. My egg cracked, and a big part of who I am came to light, but I still don't truly know who I am as a person. I haven't given myself the chance to develop interests up until a few months ago. I'm sorry if none of this makes sense, I just threw up in my work bathroom and am on the verge of a breakdown lmao	"I don‚Äôt know how long you‚Äôve been on HRT but that helps a bunch.

I'm very much in this situation right now - just started going through other major life changes at the same time as transitioning, kinda overwhelming right now but I'm really hoping all of this will help me there!
Coming up on a year in June, and hopefully it helps. It's already helped me to come out of the really dark place I was my whole life, so yeah
Hey stranger! This sounds really tough and i can only imagine how this must feel, but i am admiring you for your strength!! Keep going and do stuff that makes you comfortable. You dont have to stick to binary gender roles or binary gender expressions or gender expectations in general.

Parent of trans boy seeking advice	"I am the parent of an 11 year old trans boy.  We have recently moved to a new city and he has started middle school.  His classmates do not know he is trans.  He wants to keep it this way but I don't believe that is realistic - a teacher could slip up, a fellow student could ask why he uses special bathrooms and changing rooms, etc.

My fear is that we could be headed towards a very public and painful outing.  I'm also concerned that some of the friends he is making might reject him (we live in Trump country).  My question is whether it is better to proactively diffuse the situation by sharing that he is trans.  I'd appreciate any advice.   
 Thank you."	"hey! it‚Äôs amazing that you‚Äôre supporting your son on his journey. i totally get where you‚Äôre coming from‚Äî i escaped the south pretty recently. so the teacher knows‚Äî? did i read that right? 

for now i‚Äôd say leave it as is, let your son handle it as is. but the second something happens step up to defend him. make sure his teacher knows xyz happened and fight for him i what i‚Äôd go with!!
Glad you support him, and though I know it's coming from the best intentions, I don't think you should go against his wishes. Outing someone without their consent is never okay. 

Being ready to support him if things crash is all you can do. And hey, maybe everything will be fine:)
It's not a romantic relationship, and Imo if you're in a trump county the last thing I'd do is out myself. You live in a trump dominant area, why guarentee you paint a target on your own back? Best case scenario he passes and nobody knows the difference, and if he does get outed later we can hope that his new friends knowing him personally will dissuade any negativity. Otherwise I'd be more worried he'd just get ostracized because nobody gave him a chance to just be himself
I think it‚Äôs best not to say anything for now. Your son probably has a plan and reason for choosing to stay stealth (based on where you live I can take a good guess). Just make sure to support him in what he chooses and be ready to back him up when/if something happens. Thank you for supporting your son!"	wo4zuv	trans	45	0.95	2022-08-14 12:14:33
How do Trans people go about using public restrooms?	"One time in San Francisco from a long road trip I had to use the bathroom really bad and went inside the men‚Äôs restroom because the woman‚Äôs restroom had a very long line and I had police escort me out the restroom. I‚Äôm the type to go to any restroom (if I had to go really bad) and that was the only restrooms around me. Because of this incident I wondered how trans people decide which restroom to go to. I‚Äôm sure they face unnecessary criticism and I feel like they shouldn‚Äôt feel ashamed of going to any restroom. I been seeing a lot of trans discrimination so I wonder what do trans people do when they have to use the restroom in public places? Do you try not to go at all and avoid it? 

*Serious inquires only*( I apologize if I offended anyone with this post)"	"Using the wrong bathroom before medical transition and I‚Äòll try to avoid public toilets until I pass fairly well while transitioning.  

Meanwhile hoping our media won‚Äòt start a witch hunt as they did in the us and uk, because that leads to [these types of outcomes exactly (youtube link)](https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PZ3qRKNojqg)
I started using the women‚Äôs restroom the moment I could squeak out a passable ‚Äúhello‚Äù or ‚Äúthank you‚Äù. Thanks to Covid I was already passing with a mask visually but still working on the voice. Most times the restroom was empty anyway, so I didn‚Äôt have to worry about it. But that was also my incentive to really get my voice going.
That‚Äôs a funny story. I don‚Äôt. If I‚Äôm out in public I‚Äôll make sure I don‚Äôt have to go. I‚Äôm not brave enough to go into the bathroom and not have an anxiety attack about being assaulted
I been going to the restroom with a trans woman since she was a trans kid. We go the same mental health center. She was afraid  to go to either restroom. She had to go bad I told her to come with me and she has been going to the women's room with me  ever since.  I am an 66f year old and she is 40 something now. I have gone to the men's room when the lines were to long and have never seen a cop.
I try to avoid it if I can. If I must, it depends on where I am, who I'm with, what I'm wearing, and what I'm doing. If, for whatever reason, I'm presenting male, I'll use the men's room. If I'm with another woman, I'll typically go in with her. If I'm alone, it really depends on the setting. Inclusive gaming convention? Sure thing I'll use the women's room. Restaurant? Eh maybe. Bottom line is that I have to consider the risk of harassment or assault in either restroom and pick the one that seems safest in the moment.
I'm a 22 transman and I always use the men's restroom. I've never had an issue and I am not on hormones at all. I assume most people assume I'm like 16 so I've never had anything said to me. The only time I've ever felt uncomfortable with using the men's is qhen I was in high school and now when I go to he bar
We don't mostly.
I am not out yet and I have a problem since I don't indeitfy with as being one of the binary genders. 

I usually go to the women restroom
I use the men‚Äôs side regularly when I go to the gym. I was nervous at first but really if I just mind my own business, I just get cursory glances and nothing more.

Now, the first time I went to the men‚Äôs restroom was when I was at the doctor‚Äôs office. I think I scared one man out of the restroom when he saw me actually washing my hands‚Ä¶ and probably having a rounder face. I thought I looked pretty passing that day, but my men‚Äôs button down was also floral so maybe not. But he like walked in, saw me drying off my hands, and walked out lol it was weird.

Idk. I‚Äôve had to use the women‚Äôs restroom once since then when I was at the gym (my butt was about to explode and it was closer), and I have never felt more uncomfortable in my life. Going back to the women‚Äôs‚Ä¶ idk it just felt like I didn‚Äôt belong. No one seemed to mind me but also felt like I got weirder glances‚Ä¶ but probably not any weirder than I get on the men‚Äôs side.

Edit: I‚Äôm a trans man, pre medical transition, but socially transitioned and with a short haircut and always wearing a binder when I go out.
That is actually illegal because California does not have any ""bathroom laws"" on their books.

Was this SFPD or a local rent-a-cop? SFPD should know better, and if they don't file a complaint with the city/county (San Francisco is both a city and county.) If it was a rent-a-cop, find out the company they work for and sue them for harassment.

But, in my experience, before I was coded 'girl' by society, I used the men's or the unisex, even while dressing (you should have seen some of the looks I got while stood at the urinal and wearing a skirt - scary and funny at the same time since dudes **don't** look at each other in the toilet, but there I am, big as life wearing a skirt and nail lacquer.) Once I started getting ""The ladies is next door, miss"" is when I switched to using the women's (and unisex)
Go with whatever bathroom you‚Äôre presenting as in the moment. Fem? Women‚Äôs. Masc? Men‚Äôs. It can still be a little dodgy depending on region.. you would think San Fran would be more understanding though.
(ftm) since I'm pre-t and don't exactly look like the most overly ""masculine"" man I just use the girls bathroom to be safe, though I've gotten weird looks sometimes from the women in there
Easy, (trans dude) I get fucked. /j /lh
I drink as little liquid as possible when I‚Äôm out and I hold it.  If there is a gender neutral or all gender single stall restroom then I will go.  If there‚Äôs a gendered multi stall bathroom I do not use the bathroom.  If there‚Äôs a gendered single stall bathroom, I ask my wife to come with me and wait outside the door with me.

But mostly I don‚Äôt go to the bathroom when I‚Äôm out.
I am a Trans woman and still use men's restroom because still early in transition and i don't pass at all. But I try and not use any restroom and wait if I can
Yeah I literally would just hold it when I first came out

Once I didn‚Äôt pee for 9 hours because I didn‚Äôt want to use a public bathroom. Like legit I just went ‚ÄúI simply don‚Äôt piss üòé‚Äù

But now I don‚Äôt care. I use the womens bathroom and nobody‚Äôs ever said anything. I pass fine though so that might be part of it. Sometimes if I‚Äôm feeling dysphoric I‚Äôll use a gender neutral bathroom or single occupancy/family bathroom (if there is one available).

But deadass if someone tries to stop me from using the womens now I‚Äôm shitting in the water fountain
In less liberal states, whenever I'm traveling, if my mom doesn't go with me (since I know she'd protect me in any situation where I'm in danger) I usually use the women's bathroom (same applies in liberal states, except I don't feel the need to have my mother with me, I'm 17 MtF just to clear things up), but otherwise I use men's since I know I can pass just through my voice.
The same way i did pre transition, avoid going in that gross mofo at all costs
The only public restroom I feel safe using is the one at my job, although even that‚Äôs iffy as not every customer hears my voice and I pass pretty well half of the time. The only one I‚Äôll use without a second thought is the dentist I go to because it‚Äôs literally a single bathroom.
I try to find single stall bathrooms.. carry a bottle in the car. Or always go with my girlfriend. I pass pretty well atleast... So there is that...
Most of the time I feel like no one really cares? But it all depends. 
Before I medically transitioned I kinda felt out the vibe of the place I was in before choosing a restroom (luckily for me I passed before medically transitioning as long as I didn‚Äôt speak). Most of the time I went for the mens room. But if it was a time where I felt like I wasn‚Äôt passing that day I‚Äôd use the women‚Äôs.
I'm a woman so I use the women's washroom. It's as simple as that for me. The thought of using the men's room makes me very uncomfortable.

Actually, now that I think about it, during the first reopenings after the lockdowns I stepped into a men's restroom because both of the restrooms were reduced to single occupancy and the women's room was taken. I figured, no big deal, they're both effectively all-gender washrooms. But while I sat on the toilet men came in and out using the urinal. I was mortified. I waited until a lull in foot traffic to finish up and get the fuck out of there.

Would I have gotten in trouble? Not in the legal sense. In Canada anyone of any gender may use any washroom they please. Might I have gotten in trouble with the men using the washroom? Perhaps. But when you gotta go you gotta go.
I use the bathroom that matches my gender and have done from the moment I realised I was trans. I have only had two issues in 7 months.

 before I realised I was trans I used the bathroom that matched my AGAB and had negative comments every few months. You just have to be confident
It‚Äôs scary and dangerous and it matters a lot on the vibe, who I‚Äôm with, and the urgency.  

I pass decently well. On a good day, no one in the woman‚Äôs is going to give me a second glance. I would never use the mens. When I passed less well, I planned entire days around gender neutral washrooms. I even had a Disney trip where we mapped out all the single occupant washrooms before traveling to the park.
Incredibly nerve racking. WHICH SUCKS BECAUSE I GET TOO NERVOUS TO PISS SO I HAVE TO WAIT LONGER WHICH MAKES ME MORE NERVOUS- in short we (perhaps just i) piss in panic almost all the time while in public. Its straight up awful
I just try to avoid it at all, but if I have to usually Starbucks or something similar has single occupant bathrooms, which are a godsend
I avoid them all together. But sometimes that's impossible. I don't feel safe in either of them (I'm FTM, over a year on T). I don't feel comfortable in either the mens or the womens because I've noticed two things (personally): 1. In the womens I am stared at and yelled at or asked dumb questions, and 2. I feel physically unsafe in the mens restroom, like I could be ganged up on and beat up. So with all of that being said, I try to avoid them all together unfortunately
atm i use the women's, because my chest isn't flat and so i don't pass as a man. once i get a binder and start to pass, i will start going to the men's restrooms. already i get some odd looks in the women's, so hopefully i can get a binder soon. super nervous about going in the men's for the first time though, i might wait until i can go with a friend lol.
For me as a trans woman it feels wrong to use the mens washroom because i feel like an invader i would feel more vulnerable presenting femme in the mens too.

Using the womans makes sense wherever I am, I wouldn't visit a country where it is illegal to be trans anyhow or at the very least without someone with me either outside or inside the womans room
I‚Äôve used the men‚Äôs bathroom for most of my life idk I don‚Äôt really think about it
I just don‚Äôt, I make sure I don‚Äôt need to go before leaving the house and I don‚Äôt drink any liquids while out (if possible)
Transmasc about 7 years on T checking in. I don't always pass as a cis guy (or a straight one at least, which can be important) because I'm smaller, and I guess there's just something about my face that doesn't ping the ""cis guy"" box for a lot of people. They might get that I'm male, but almost everyone I've encountered that I've asked about my appearance and ""passability"" seems to think I look visibly queer. Don't know why. 

I have a lot of anxiety using men's restrooms because I'm scared someone will notice I'm sitting down and bust a gasket since there's more visibility about trans people now. For the record, I live in the southern US. Also, just logistically, there are usually less stalls in the men's restroom so if a bunch of grody cis dudes have devastated the stalls, I'm out of luck. There have been plenty of road trips where we had to stop at multiple gas stations just so that I could use a single stall that hadn't already been demolished for the day. (God, I miss women's restrooms.)

I work in a public library, and I will never use the public bathrooms if I can help it (we thankfully have staff single stalls). I feel like this isn't the experience for a lot of trans guys, but coupled with my location in the south and the fact that I don't always pass, these are the strategies that make me feel safe.

Edit to add: I'm also masc enough that using the women's restroom would cause problems too + dysphoria
I walk in women's restroom find an empty stall that has toilet paper and sit down do my business, then I go to the sink wash my hands and walk out.

Thanks for the video! Even though we have progressed as humans there are some that are still ignorant and oblivious to the struggles that trans people may have. My post just mentions one of the  many struggles of trans people.
I find it so unfair that Trans people have to go through all this. I know as a person I wouldn‚Äôt discriminate because we are all humans. Either way thanks for sharing your experience. I just don‚Äôt like how there‚Äôs still people like this in the world still discriminating over gender and race. It‚Äôs frustrating living with ignorant people.
Oh my God the masking was so helpful! I still have beard shadow I cannot get rid of through shaving (working on laser now) so a mask to cover up made it so I just looked like a flat-chested tomboy. I'm now up to a small-chested something, so progress!
Aish~ I see. That‚Äôs what I assume some trans people will do. If I was trans I would just decide to whichever line was shorter at that time. I‚Äôm not trying to poo in my pants but having that fear instilled in you because of the way other react is such a problem on it‚Äôs own.
Sheesh than I must have had bad luck :(. Either way I love this story. Brings to light an issue in the trans community. Thanks for sharing your story~~~üòä
That sounds like the logical approach. I would have done that to if I was in your position. Thanks for sharing!~
I see. There are a lot of things that can go wrong like people getting physically hurt by others. So you try every way possible not to enter the bathroom even though you need to use it
Hopefully future generations will not be ignorant and not cause others harm because this is a hard pill to swallow that this is a reality for some people.
I feel like woman are more kinder to trans in restrooms or am I wrong? Yeah I should have talked to the people escorting me out.
It was cops at the Pier39 by the restrooms. üò©
No, seriously though I try to use the middle ground when I can and if not I just don't at all.
Impresiv√≥ I could never hold my pee that long. Though you shouldn‚Äôt have to do or feel this way. Like someone in the comment section said ‚Äúsociety keeps Trans people on the leash.‚Äù
Wow, I didn‚Äôt think about the more conservative states‚Ä¶ thanks for sharing!
It‚Äôs because of the discrimination you may face and abuse?
So using unisex bathrooms and one bathroom bathrooms are the safest bet in any caseüò©
Ah so your from Canada. I enjoy reading peoples comments from different countries. I‚Äôm from America.
Confidence is key!~~~ü§©
Yeah I figured. I‚Äôm sorry you all have to deal with these issues that shouldn‚Äôt be a problem‚Ä¶
I couldn‚Äôt do that to myself but sometimes that‚Äôs the safest option in certain cases.
Tbh honest. I like when people ask dumb questions because they can be clueless about certain things. I understand though it can be quite uncomfortable
Is it because of the glares and rude comments and the abuse that may happen in the restrooms?
Man even other countries especially the more conservative ones.
Have you read through the comment section yet? These are possible scenarios that might happen. I‚Äôm glad you didn‚Äôt think about it and just handled it like an everyday task. That‚Äôs fantastic you didn‚Äôt encounter any problems while being in the mens restroom or in any restroom.
Very few people in the comment section decide not to go at all because of possible interactions and altercations with people.
Ah but you don‚Äôt feel uneasy just going to a restroom in public because of the fear of other people?
good bot
[removed]
Honestly ive just gotten used to holding it being in constant pain if i have to. I‚Äôd take that any day over the fear of using the womens washroom, and the sheer grossness that seems to fill all the mens washrooms. (Seriously is it just the ones around here or are they the most disgusting thing ever??)
We're on a bathroom leash because of society in many places, it sucks but nothing we can do about it.
There are tricks, non of them physically healthy, mostly just avoid drinking liquids when out, go before you leave and keep trips relatively short unless you know a convenient gender neutral toilet is available. 

The key is segregation really, stick to the inclusive places, the gay places and the progressive areas where you know people will have you back if a terf takes exception to your existance.
Well, cops tend to have an overinflated sense of duty so colour me unsurprised that it was police. I‚Äôm really sorry you had to go through that. Major city in a blue state you would think would be safe, sad to know it‚Äôs not. All the more reason to gtfo of this overinflated cost on everything state
It's because public toilets are gross af!
Pretty much unfortunately. Unless the people there know you
It really is :) if you look like you belong then you do ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

The first problem I had was because all the stalls where out of order and I looked lost so I got challenged 

The second one was a group of men tried to beat me up because they decided I was gay (I am) luckily I managed to escape
You know, being the minority in the zeitgeist is a special sort of experience. They‚Äôre always talking about me on your Fox News* and most folks have an opinion about me. 

But I‚Äôm the happiest I‚Äôve ever been, I‚Äôm proud to be trans, and damnit if I didn‚Äôt get a LOT hotter.
You get used to it after a point, so I mean that counts for something. And look at the bright side, I now know how to piss under high stress situations. If the apocalypse started inside a bathroom  I‚Äôm prepared.
i mean, i'm lucky i live in a pretty accepting area, so i'm unlikely to face physical or verbal abuse, but there's a lot of confused glares from middle aged women. atm i tend to try and puff my chest out to make it obvious i'm female, but once i get a binder i won't feel comfortable in the women's. i'm scared the treatment will be worse in the men's. though to be fair, from what i've heard the men's will be better.
The only problem I‚Äôve had is one time this guy I knew from elementary school tried to beat me up but he was scrawny asf
Yeah that‚Äôs the exact issue. I scare mothers with their children üò©
No, I don't because I am only there to do what the room is there for. I don't care what other people think. I'm comfortable in my own skin.
True dat. üò´
Not that I‚Äôm sexist but I usually hear about men abusing trans more than woman‚Ä¶ that‚Äôs what disappoints me about the male population and how men are usually the ones committing crimes. Ofc not all men but it‚Äôs disappointing the amount of abuse trans receive while being in the mens restroom
Wow what‚Äôs a zeitgeist? Yes, be proud to be trans and be who you want to be. Being happy with yourself is key.
What an odd way to look at it üò©
Everyone has there experiences usually I hear people say woman‚Äôs restrooms are better when it comes to respecting people. The experiences all depend on whose there in the restrooms and where your located. Do you live in a more liberal state?
Not him being scrawny üò≠ I want to know what happened next.
Yasss~ glad your happy being you. For me I don‚Äôt like getting judged a lot or I care what people think of me. Which is my personal issue
I‚Äôm a trans guy and cis men tend to be really nice to me, I get the most rude remarks and abuse from cis women.
Sorry, Jewish term.  Zeitgeist is like ‚Äúthe cultural conversation‚Äù or ‚Äúwhat folks are thinking about, seeing in the news, etc.‚Äù
On that sigma female grindset
i live in the south of the uk.

in my experience, middle-aged women tend to be the ones who give me funny looks. younger women and older women are 50/50. either totally supportive (if a little confused) or really judgemental.

according to one of my trans friends who goes to the men's, men are pretty awkward so they don't say anything if they even notice (which apparently they mostly don't).

thing is, women's restrooms are supposedly friendlier because women talk to each other more, while men ignore each other. but that means that if men see a trans person, they keep quiet about it, whereas women aren't afraid to point you out or say something.
I won the fight
Ah I see. Maybe it‚Äôs about 50/ 50 or depends who it is. I really wish this wouldn‚Äôt be such an issue yet it is.
Ah didn‚Äôt think of that. You in general just don‚Äôt want to be bothered. Yeah usually men mind there business."	vwuob3	trans	42	0.9	2022-07-11 22:10:19
feeling ...not really real lately	"sorry if i flaired wrong im still pretty new to all this stuff and dont kno if its the appropriate tagging but i hope so

since ive finally like, kinda started to realise and accept i see myself more as a guy rather than nonbinary ive started to zone out alot more. maybe its cause school just started up but i look at my arms and body and face and just cant recognise myself anymore, its becoming worse and worse as the days go by.

 i had to sit in the bathroom and stare at myself for AWHILE to realise i was staring at myself and not someone else. its really messing me up and i dont really feel real because of it, it feels like im watching someone elses life. i dont feel like ill be able to accept myself or my appearance until im actively changing or look like a man. but even then it still might not help, but yeah im getting more and more distant from my appearance and it makes me feel really disoriented 

 im gonna talk to my psychiatrist about it but i have to wait awhile for that since the next session is next month. but yeah, just a small rant"	"Depersonalization/derealization (DPDR) is unfortunately pretty common among trans folk. Take a read of [https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/biochemical-dysphoria](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/biochemical-dysphoria). Definitely talk to your therapist about it and take care.
Disassociation is a common symptom of dysphoria, it helps your brain cope with the stress of not being in the right body. It fucking sucks though dude, hopefully as you start to transition and pass more it'll get better - if that's what you're aiming for in your gender of course, it is not an obligation!
I try to memorize my face in the mirror. One day I spent 30 minutes staring at myself going over every detail. Then come back to the mirror 10 minutes later and everything‚Äôs changed and I don‚Äôt recognize the person staring back at me. It‚Äôs hard not knowing what you look like at any given time, but just remember to take it one day at a time.
have you taken any drugs?

No"	ss9nyv	trans	45	0.94	2022-02-14 12:39:30
My son is trans and he‚Äôs the best thing in my life.	"Hi everyone. I have a child that was AFAB and has been living as male for nearly 2 years now. I hope I‚Äôm in the right sub for this and I know this is long so if you don‚Äôt want to read so much, there is a TL;DR at the bottom. 

To begin, my son is turning 12 at the end of the month (Sept 27). A few months ago, he started puberty and it was so traumatic for both of us. He cried and I cried and it was so hard. It hurt me so much to see him in pain and I knew then that I‚Äôd do anything to take that pain away. I was just not ready for this to happen so soon. I didn‚Äôt start mine until I was almost 17 so I thought he had plenty of time. I immediately found him a therapist and he‚Äôs now into his third one that he‚Äôs been seeing for a few months (the first two didn‚Äôt work out but this one seems to be going well I think). And recently she told us that he is okay to start puberty blockers (yayy) so I‚Äôve been trying to find a pediatric endocrinologist that can get him started. I hate to watch him go through this horrible experience and it makes me feel so terrible for him. I hope to get him on the puberty blockers asap, especially with his birthday around the corner. Speaking of which, I want to do something special for him because the last few years have been very difficult between his father and I splitting (after years of fighting and me putting up with his abuse). I made the decision to leave and moved my son and I 3 hours drive away from there. My son knows his dad is a bad person and he doesn‚Äôt really even want to see him. He‚Äôs very protective of me and couldn‚Äôt stand seeing me being abused. There‚Äôs been so much pain and suffering in our lives and I really want this to be a special birthday for him. So any ideas are welcome. I can‚Äôt seem to get anything out of him. He won‚Äôt ask for much because he knows I don‚Äôt have much and he doesn‚Äôt want to stress me out but I keep telling him that money isn‚Äôt an issue and this birthday is going to be special whether he likes it or not. So I‚Äôm kind of on my own trying to figure out what I can do with him that will make it special. 

Anyway, moving on from that, I guess I‚Äôm here because I don‚Äôt know where else to go or who to talk to. I love my son more than anything in the world and he‚Äôs the most amazing person I know. He is just so smart, kind, and brave; he‚Äôs just such an amazing kid. He calls his cycle his ‚Äúman period.‚Äù Which I don‚Äôt know where he got that from but I love it. And yet, I have so many things that worry me. I know he‚Äôs strong and he can handle almost anything. I just want to do whatever I can to help. I grew up in a family that was very homophobic and made me feel terrible about who I was. I want to make sure my son doesn‚Äôt ever have to experience the shame, humiliation, and depression that my own family put me through. 

My mom says that it‚Äôs somehow my fault that I made him think he‚Äôs a boy because I‚Äôm so open about being pansexual and about my own struggles with my gender identity. I don‚Äôt really identify as either gender and I‚Äôve been using the label non-binary for now. I‚Äôm still figuring it out. I changed my name a long time ago because I hated my birth name, it was too feminine and it just didn‚Äôt fit me. I use a more gender neutral name now, Lee. But my parents refuse to call me by that name even though I‚Äôve been using it for close to 15 years now and they‚Äôre the only ones who call me my birth name, which I hate and it has a lot of trauma attached to it. I‚Äôm sure you all can understand that. 

I also caused a lot of drama when I named my baby Elliot (I chose that name after having an ultrasound and being told I was having a girl). My entire family hated it and I had people literally coming at me with lists of alternative more feminine names (like Ella or Ellen and similar) and berating me for choosing a ‚Äúboys name‚Äù for my female baby. But I didn‚Äôt care and I refused to budge. I just loved the name so much and now I‚Äôm so glad I didn‚Äôt give in because people have thought Elliot was a boy from the very beginning. For the first few years I was constantly having to correct people when they thought my baby was a boy and I thought I had a girl and of course he was too young to tell us yet. On top of the whole name thing, it bothered my family that I let my kid play with all kinds of toys and wear all kinds of different clothes. I never believed that toys and clothes should be gendered so I always just let my kid play with whatever he wanted and dressed him in a variety of clothing from both sides of the store because if I liked something then I got it and it never mattered to me if it was labeled for boys or girls. My kid played with dolls and kitchen sets and also cars and tool kits and so on. Whatever he liked, I let him have. I know that none of that made him trans. I know he was born that way and I believe him when he says he‚Äôs a boy. I‚Äôve had a feeling for awhile because he used to tell me that he liked when people referred to him as male and as he got old enough to choose his own style, he would always ask me to get him boy clothes and to let him cut his hair shorter and shorter every time. And I always felt my job was not to dictate how he dressed or what he played with but to just let him express himself however he wanted. He came out to me officially when he was 10 and I was scared at first because I felt like he was too young. But I also never doubted him for a second and I know that he is sure about who he is. I‚Äôm so proud of him because he‚Äôs so strong and so smart. 

About a year ago, he said that if he could have just one wish, he would wish that he was a boy. I cried. But I knew for sure that he was a boy and I would do anything to help him be himself. His happiness is all that matters to me. A few months later, he decided he wanted to come out to the family and even to people at school. Most of the kids at school thought he was a boy already because he looks like a boy. Fortunately, his teachers and counselors were very supportive and kind and they even let him use the one gender neutral bathroom in the office because he was afraid to use the boys bathroom or the girls. That helped a lot. 

The scariest part for me was coming out to my parents. I knew they wouldn‚Äôt be so open. My mom still thinks he is ‚Äúway too young to make this kind of decision‚Äù (she doesn‚Äôt understand that it isn‚Äôt a choice) and she‚Äôs told me that I‚Äôm pushing him in the wrong direction because I‚Äôm encouraging him by allowing him to dress how he wants and helping to get him put on puberty blockers. I know that is total nonsense and I‚Äôm not going to listen to anything she says. It just bugs me so much. She misgenders him a lot but I make a point to correct her every time and it‚Äôs actually gotten better lately. She is starting to use male pronouns more now and I‚Äôm going to keep correcting her if she slips up. At this point I‚Äôm giving her the benefit of the doubt and just trying to teach her that being trans or gay or whatever is not a choice anymore than her being straight and cis is a choice for her. I‚Äôm so proud of my son for everything he‚Äôs helped me achieve, for being brave and helping me to open up the minds and hearts of my family. I honestly never thought they‚Äôd accept him and even though it hasn‚Äôt been easy, it‚Äôs not as bad as I expected it would be. 

So I guess I am here for some advice and maybe also some stories from some of you. If it‚Äôs not too hard to share, I would love to hear what your experiences were like. And for those who had negative experiences, what is something you wish your parent or other loved ones had done or said to make your coming out and/or your transition easier? What do you wish they would say or do now that would make you feel more validated? The reason I ask this is because I want to make sure I do the right things and help my son feel proud to be himself and show him that I‚Äôm always on his side no matter what. 

I‚Äôm willing to do anything to make my son‚Äôs life easier. I know he will deal with some bad stuff and that I can‚Äôt protect him forever. So I want to prepare him for that. At the same time, I want him to see that there are plenty of good people in the world too, who will love and respect him for who he is. I want to show him that he‚Äôs not alone and that he‚Äôs loved and respected. 

I‚Äôm sorry for the long rant and I hope that I didn‚Äôt break any rules here. I just have been wanting to reach out to others for so long. I‚Äôve been wanting to hear stories, experiences, and advice. So that I can be the best parent I possibly can be for my son. Because especially now I am all he has (and he is all I have). He struggles to make friends. A lot of that is my fault because we have moved so many times. And having to start middle school online isn‚Äôt helping. It‚Äôs been him and me for a long time now but the last few months we‚Äôve been just the two of us at home all day every day because of the pandemic. 

I struggle with mental illness myself and I left his father because he was abusive. I had to move away from him for my own sanity and to start a better life for my son and myself. I wish I could get him to talk to someone but he has a hard time opening up fully and I never want to press him on anything because I don‚Äôt want to cause him any pain. I just want him to be happy. 

So if you‚Äôve read this far, thank you. And if you have any advice or stories or anything to share with me, I will be eternally grateful. 

If I posted this in the wrong place, I‚Äôm so sorry; please let me know and I‚Äôll remove it. If you can point me in the right direction then I‚Äôll go there. I just didn‚Äôt know where to turn. Life has not been easy for us. I know it‚Äôs been hard for so many people. I hope that everyone is staying healthy and safe. I look forward to reading your responses. Thank you so much in advance. You are amazing people and I love you all.

TL;DR: My young child (AFAB) came out as trans and I want to be as supportive as possible and make life easier, better, and happier for him. I‚Äôd love to hear your stories, experiences, advice, etc. Thank you.

Edit: I just noticed someone gave this post a wholesome award. That is so sweet. Thank you. You are all so amazing and I‚Äôm so glad I decided to post here. Your comments have made me feel so much better. ü•∞"	"I honestly dont have anything to say bc you seem like a grwat parent. It puts ME at ease hearing about binary breaking/gender ruless parenting and how i might want to parent my maybe future child. Ive been looking for examples and im glad i found one.
I have no advice for you but I just wanted to say that you seem to do everything right. You respect and support and love him obviously very very much and I think you're doing everything right. I think you're an amazing parent!
I'm crying right now, reading this. You're such a wonderful parent, and your son is so lucky to have someone like you in his life.

I identify as non-binary, but am seriously struggling with the possibility that I might just straight up be, but more on the masculine side, and I wish my parents were even half as supportive as you. I was accidentally outed by my well meaning brother to my parents, and have dealt with all sorts of"" comments such as ""keep it between you and your friends"" when I tried to explain my pronouns and ""you're perfect just the way you are, you shouldn't worry about your chest"" when I expressed severe discomfort and a wish to bind.

I don't have any advice other than to keep doing what you're doing. It'll be hard, sure, but with someone like you in his life, he'll make it through. Thank you for your story.
You‚Äôre doing everything right. You‚Äôre making the boy happy and even tho he has a crap way of showing it, as teenagers do, he loves you to death and back. If it would make him happy, I‚Äôm sure that the majority of people that have seen your post would want to wish him a happy birthday. There‚Äôs plenty of things that he might like on Etsy, so I would start there when coming up with a present idea. Maybe dog tags or his name on a necklace with his pronouns.
You're doing the best that you can by your son. Most parents wouldn't have done half the things that you've done for him and it just goes to show how much you truly care for him. If he isn't telling you what he wants for his birthday, it might be because he just wants to spend time with you. Birthdays aren't all about the presents. I wish you both the best of luck on your journey together. Be well and stay safe.
Females hit puberty sooner so try to get him male hormones quick I know some girls who grew breasts at 9
You sound like a really loving and supportive mom gj ‚ù§Ô∏è this is kinda random, but I was just curious because I don't really know a whole lot of gender dysphoria and stuff. I've seen some people, especially younger trans people, say that a lot of children are diagnosed with gender dysphoria by doctors/therapists before they start puberty blockers. I know that doesn't always happen though, so what are the requirements to get it? Like, do the doctors diagnose them as well beforehand? (Pure curiousity)
Thank you. I have always believed that everyone deserves to be loved and respected for who they are and not ever let society or anyone push their beliefs on others. It bothers me how my family tried to do it to me and it made me want to go hard in the opposite direction. I honestly struggled with my gender identity for a long time and I didn‚Äôt really know that I could be anything else but what I was told that I was. I just always felt like I didn‚Äôt fit into either category and didn‚Äôt realize that there are more options. But when my son came out, I started doing a lot of research on gender and it opened my eyes to so many things. I feel like I never would have been able to understand myself as much as I do now if not for my son. He expanded my world in ways that I never could have imagined. I have known I was not straight since I was little. But I didn‚Äôt really know much about how my sexuality related to my gender identity or expression. It‚Äôs such a beautiful thing. I now understand that gender is a spectrum just like sexuality. I hope to find a community where I live that I can get involved with and maybe meet some new people. My sons first appointment with his pediatric endocrinologist is later today and I‚Äôm so thrilled. It was originally scheduled for later this month but I kept on top of them and they managed to squeeze us in. I am so excited and also nervous. I think I still have so much to learn and I am always happy to learn new things. I appreciate your kind words. And wish you all the best in the future. ü•∞
Thank you so much! I always have so many doubts and I question myself all the time. Like I never know if I‚Äôm doing the right thing. I am constantly terrified that I‚Äôll mess things up. But I have severe anxiety about everything so it‚Äôs not just this. It‚Äôs only more extreme because my son is the most important thing in my life and I would do anything to make sure he has a happy life. I feel like this is the minimum of what a parent should do and I can never understand any parent who doesn‚Äôt love and respect their child. I know so many kids whose parents don‚Äôt accept them and it hurts me to see that. I wish I could take them all in and show them they are all amazing and beautiful and deserving of love and respect. And shame on those parents who can‚Äôt accept their own children for being themselves. Those people make me so mad.
I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre having to deal with that from your parents. I can relate. My own parents were extremely homophobic, as was my brother. I was bullied a lot at school and at home just because I never fit in. My own family called me a freak and a weirdo and my mom would compare me to other girls my age and ask why I can‚Äôt be more like them. I also have several mental health issues that went ignored most of my life. That led to self harm and multiple suicide attempts (all of which my mom still denies even when the scars are very much there on my body). It‚Äôs insanity how parents can be sometimes. I never thought I‚Äôd be a parent and never really wanted to be only because I was scared I‚Äôd be like my own mom. And sometimes I‚Äôm scared that I‚Äôm doing the wrong thing. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes, mostly because of my mental illness and putting up with my abusive ex out of fear. I know that stuff was very traumatic for my child. He‚Äôs seen me at my worst and it can be very hard on him. But no matter what, he knows that I love him and there‚Äôs nothing in the world that could change that. I even recently started seeing a therapist again because my depression has been so bad and I wanted to show him that I‚Äôm willing to work on myself because he‚Äôs been in therapy for awhile and he doesn‚Äôt think he needs it. So I thought maybe if I did it too then he‚Äôd see that therapy isn‚Äôt something to be ashamed of. My own family refused to put me in therapy because my mom was afraid of what people would think of her. Her reputation as the perfect mom was more important than her child‚Äôs mental health. The way my family treated me left me with zero self esteem and then they wonder why I am this way. I got the same kind of nonsense that you described like just be happy with your body how it is and just be normal and stupid stuff like that. It‚Äôs so ridiculous to me how anyone can say those things, especially to a child who is hurting and confused. My parents didn‚Äôt allow me to even have friends who were gay because they thought that it would like rub off on me or something. I don‚Äôt even know what they were thinking. I could tell so many stories about how my family treated me growing up but it‚Äôs not important now. I think of it as a learning experience. I could never treat my child that way. It‚Äôs not just wrong, it‚Äôs borderline abusive I think. 

I knew for awhile that my child was different and I was determined to let him figure it out on his own without pushing any sort of agenda or trying to put him in a box. It hurts me to hear stories of families rejecting their children. It brings me pain but also makes me so mad. When you bring a child into the world, you‚Äôre meant to love them no matter what. For awhile I identified as bisexual but then I changed to pan because I think it‚Äôs more inclusive and also bi implies there‚Äôs only two genders and I know that‚Äôs not true. Gender and sexuality are both spectrums and there‚Äôs so many wonderful amazing people all along those spectrums. Every single one of us is deserving of love and respect for who we are. 

I hope that things get better for you. If you ever want to talk, you can reach out to me. I‚Äôm always happy to chat. I appreciate how brave you are to share you story with me. And I hope you know that you are amazing and wonderful and that you deserve to be loved and respected for who you are. And nobody can tell you who that is. Only you know in your heart and mind who you really are. If your family can‚Äôt see and love the real you, then honestly that is their loss. They will miss out on an amazing person. I think you‚Äôre perfect just the way you are but not in the way that they see you. If binding is what makes you comfortable and happy, then that is part of who you are and you should do it. Never let anyone define you. It‚Äôs your life and you deserve to be happy and comfortable in your body. Whatever it takes to get you to that place, you should chase after it. I wish you all the best. Stay strong. And never forget that you are beautiful, strong, and you are loved. ü•∞
I just bought a beautiful flag that he found on amazon which is essentially the trans flag and over that is a heart with the pan colors. It‚Äôs beautiful. He pointed it out to me and said, ‚Äúlook it represents both of us.‚Äù So of course I could not resist buying it. He‚Äôs also been complaining about needing a new phone for awhile so I spoke to my parents and they helped chip in to get him a new phone in his favorite color. He got it this weekend and I think he is very happy about it. Also, last week I took him to get his hair cut because we haven‚Äôt gotten a hair cut since the pandemic started and he was very unhappy with his hair. I took him to a highly recommended speciality salon instead of the cheaper ones we usually go to because I wanted to make sure he was happy with it. And we looked through some photos of haircuts for men and talked with the stylist to get it just right. And I think it looks amazing. It‚Äôs actually the first time he has gotten a haircut and not had a single complaint about it so I think that means he likes it too. He‚Äôs also been asking me for some new clothes because a lot of his stuff is old hand me downs from his dad and older brother but for the most part he just shares my clothes because I have a ton of men‚Äôs stuff that I like to wear (I have a good mixture of men‚Äôs, women‚Äôs, and gender neutral clothing and we‚Äôre about the same size). I always let him pick out what he wants but it‚Äôs been awhile since we went shopping. He asked me yesterday if I‚Äôd take him to the mall soon to get some new clothes and shoes for when school reopens. So if we have time, I‚Äôll surprise him with a trip to the mall later today. I think he‚Äôll be thrilled. Whatever it takes to make him happy, I‚Äôm there. Because his happiness brings me happiness. 

Also, even though I wasn‚Äôt able to get him into the endocrinologist before his birthday, because they were booked out for like a month, I stayed on top of them and kept calling and bugging them until they agreed to squeeze us in earlier. They put us on the list to be first if anyone canceled and then they called me Friday and said they had an opening this Monday and so of course I said yes we‚Äôll take it! So in a few hours we will be seeing the endo for the initial appointment! I‚Äôm so excited. And I‚Äôm sure he is too even though he isn‚Äôt showing it. He‚Äôs been very pessimistic because he doesn‚Äôt believe he‚Äôll be able to get on the puberty blockers. For one they are super expensive. And I‚Äôm currently unemployed. I don‚Äôt think insurance covers it. But I‚Äôve promised him that I‚Äôll do whatever I have to do to get him on it as soon as possible. Even if I have to max out all my credit cards and take out some loans. Whatever it takes, I‚Äôm not giving up. I told him that his treatment is my number one priority. He knows all of the things I‚Äôm putting aside for this. Like continuing my education, upgrading my equipment for work (since I do freelance work from home and my stuff is old) and whatever other things I need. But like I‚Äôve told him over and over again, those things can wait. His happiness and comfort cannot wait. I hope that as things progress he will see that I‚Äôm not bluffing and that I‚Äôm 100% here for him. Nothing is more important. And of course I know that he‚Äôs going through a lot with just starting puberty and the wrong kind. It‚Äôs hit him very hard and I can‚Äôt blame him for feeling so miserable. I can‚Äôt even imagine how hard it must be for him going through this. And I just hope we can get things moving fast to stop it. I cry a lot about this because I can see he‚Äôs in pain and he is always trying to hide it from me. Because I suffer from several mental health issues and am recovering from drug addiction as well as ptsd from years of abuse, he has seen me in a lot of bad ways. There‚Äôs been times when I couldn‚Äôt get out of bed for days and he started to notice that I wasn‚Äôt eating so he‚Äôd bring me food and watch me eat. It‚Äôs almost like role reversal but I wasn‚Äôt able to control it. So I‚Äôve started therapy again recently because I realized that this is not healthy. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôve ever had a healthy relationship in my life. But I don‚Äôt want my son to suffer anymore because of me. I am constantly afraid that it‚Äôs too late and the damage has been done. But now I have to put my own feelings aside and take care of him. Because he needs me. And I know the sooner we can get him treated, the better and easier it will be for both of us. I‚Äôm sure the next few years will be very hard on him. But I‚Äôll always be there to support him. He‚Äôs my baby and I love him so much. And I know he loves me too. He‚Äôs just scared. Which I can understand because so am I. But I know we will get through this together. The main thing that he‚Äôs been complaining about is that it will take forever until he can really be himself and I can‚Äôt really help that cuz he‚Äôs so young. I try to tell him about people who‚Äôve had to live half their lives in the wrong body and how lucky he is to be able to start treatment at 12. And I found out recently he can even start hormones at 16 if he wants which means he‚Äôll only be a bit behind his male peers as far as starting puberty. And hey I started puberty at 16 and was the last person in my peer group to start puberty and looked like I was 12 when I was 16 but I got through it and so will he. But it‚Äôs hard to explain to a 12 year old that he can‚Äôt just get everything done in a day. These things take time. But I also know that time tends to fly by. I‚Äôm so excited to get him started on his path to his true self. 

Anyway, sorry for the long rant. I honestly haven‚Äôt had anyone to talk to about this and it‚Äôs been eating me up just keeping it all inside. Thank you so much for your kind comment. I know I‚Äôm not perfect but I‚Äôm trying as best as I know how. I didn‚Äôt have the best role models for parents and I also rushed pretty quickly from my parents abusive home into a marriage with an abusive man, which took 12 years for me to get away from and even in the last year since I left for good, he‚Äôs still got a hold on me (as the biological father of my son) and my son sees that and it hurts him. He doesn‚Äôt even want anything to do with his father who isn‚Äôt really a father at all. I‚Äôm basically his mom and dad. Which sucks for him, I know. He deserves better. I know I‚Äôve got so many problems. And I know my kid has had to deal with a lot because of me. I‚Äôm really working hard to make our lives better. I‚Äôve always put my own mental health aside because I didn‚Äôt think it mattered and I tried to control it myself and hide it but I know now that I can‚Äôt be a good parent unless I take care of myself too. So that‚Äôs what I‚Äôm doing now. I know that things will work out and one day my son will be happy. No matter what he will always have my support. Because that‚Äôs the minimum I can do as his parent. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs time for me to go get ready for the morning routine. I have to wake kiddo up for school soon, which is never easy. 

I hope everyone has a great day and week and all of that. I appreciate all the kind comments. You have really made my day. I‚Äôm glad I took the chance to post here because I was not sure what kind of reaction I‚Äôd get. But I feel a lot better now. So I‚Äôm glad I went for it. Thank you so much. You‚Äôre all amazing.
Thank you so much. I‚Äôve made a lot of mistakes in my life and as a parent but accepting him for who he is is the easiest thing to do. I don‚Äôt have any problems there. 

I did try my best for his birthday. You can read my comment above (you might not want to though cuz it‚Äôs so long). Basically, I got him a new phone (with some financial help from my parents), a haircut he loves, a few other little things I knew he wanted, and also I‚Äôm gonna take him shopping for some new clothes and shoes for when schools reopen (which I would have done sooner, but he just told me yesterday that he wants to go to the mall to get clothes so I hope I can take him today if we have time after everything else we‚Äôve got going on today or if not today, then sometime this week for sure). 

And the thing I‚Äôm most proud of: I managed to get him an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist today! Initially, the appointment was a month off. But after I bugged them to please fit him in sooner because he was suffering a lot, they called me back on Friday and said they had an opening for Monday which made me so happy. This whole thing is hitting him pretty hard and I want to make it stop like before it started (if I knew it was going to start so young, I‚Äôd have started planning things way sooner, but sadly I can‚Äôt go back in time and I thought I had so much time because I didn‚Äôt start puberty until I was 16 so I was not ready for this to happen at 11, but it‚Äôs happening now and I‚Äôm trying my best to correct it). I just hope things go well at the endo today. I‚Äôm happy that we are finally on the path towards a better life for him. Because my sons happiness is the most important thing in the world to me. üòä
I know but it‚Äôs crazy because I am also AFAB and didn‚Äôt start puberty until way late. I was almost 17 before I started menstruating and thought something was wrong with me until my mom told me that she also started late. So I was so not ready when my kid started at 11! We have been trying so hard to get him puberty blockers but they are expensive the the insurance keeps denying us. Luckily we have an amazing team on our side who will fight this. We are now waiting for an appeal and we hope it will be good news. I wish I had known sooner. I started my son on therapy when he was 11 but I had no idea that it was already happening. I wish I had known so I could have gotten this started sooner. But I really was surprised given my own family history. I was just as devastated as he was when I found out it was happening so soon. I cry a lot about it because I just want to make life easier for him and I feel so helpless right now just waiting for a decision. It sucks. All I can do now is be there for him and try to be a source of comfort and support while we wait. Hoping we get a positive decision very soon! ü§ûüèª
Thank you; my son is the most important person in the world to me and his happiness is very important to me. I think this is just what should be the norm for any parent, even though I know it‚Äôs not. It saddens me that so many parents refuse to accept their children for who they are. I love my child no matter what gender identity or sexual identity or anything else. He‚Äôs always going to be my child and nothing can ever make me love him less. 

So I‚Äôm not sure how it goes in other places, but I can tell you the process we had to go through (and are still going through). The first thing we had to do was get him a therapist who specialized in gender dysphoria in children his age. We went through three therapists before we found a good one and he‚Äôs been seeing her once a week for several months. Before anything can even begin, therapist must get to know my son and determine the correct diagnosis. If she thinks that he is in need of medical intervention, she must then write a letter explaining her diagnosis and recommendations for my son. She will be the first person who decides whether he needs and is ready to be put on puberty blockers. Once we got this letter, we then had to go to his pediatrician (or a general practitioner depending on what you have) to speak to them about the whole situation (which they have been aware of as they have been getting regular updates throughout). At this point, his doctor must provide a referral to a pediatric endocrinologist. With the referral from the doctor and the therapist, we were finally able to schedule an appointment with a pediatric endocrinologist. After meeting the endocrinologist and discussing our short and long term goals with her, she then had to order a bunch of tests, which required us to schedule an appointment with a lab where they took my sons blood for tons of tests. Once the results of all the tests came back clear (as in there was no reason for concern), then we had to meet again with the endocrinologist to go over the results of the bloodwork, what everything meant, and whether he was clear to take blockers. She explained to us the possible side effects, we discussed our options, and made a decision together as to what would be best for my son. Through all of this, he is still meeting once a week with his therapist. Once our team of doctors, along with my son and me, agreed on a course of action, we then had to put in a request to our insurance for the puberty blockers, which they have already denied us twice and we are now waiting on an appeal. In the meantime, the endo put my son on a form of birth control pill to stop him from menstruating in hopes of reducing his dysphoria just a little bit. All in all, it‚Äôs been about a year and we are still waiting for him to get the approval to get started on puberty blockers. A little side note, when I called to schedule the appointment with the endocrinologist, I was told that both parents would be required to show up there in person and sign a bunch of paperwork. Fortunately for me, I did my own divorce papers and my crazy ex just signed them so I have full custody and legal rights to make medical decisions for my son without my ex husbands approval. I can only imagine what it would be like for other kids who might have one sympathetic parent and another who wasn‚Äôt so much because if they are married or shared custody, then both parents would be required to appear and honestly if I was in this situation and my spouse refused, I would leave him immediately and do whatever it takes because my child‚Äôs happiness matters the most. Luckily for us, we didn‚Äôt have to deal with that. I feel terrible for all those kids who have to deal with horrible parents who can‚Äôt accept them. Anyway, since I didn‚Äôt need my ex there, I was able to sign all the parental paperwork and my son had to sign some paperwork as well. And now we are just waiting. We were told that they do give hormones to kids usually around age 16, but that it could be given a bit sooner if the whole team (doctors, therapist, parent(s), and child) all felt that it was the right time. But that wouldn‚Äôt be for another several years yet. Which means my son is just being forced to deal with going through the wrong puberty and it‚Äôs very difficult. 

So if anyone tries to tell you that it‚Äôs an easy process, they are lying and most likely have an agenda. I‚Äôve heard so many stories  from people who want to ignore the existence of trans people, despite the science that supports their existence. They want people to believe a young child could just walk into a clinic and walk out with hormones. That is absolutely ridiculous and an outright lie. Stories about kids getting hormones and irreversible treatments at a young age with no parental approval and many many sessions with a therapist are so fake and lie simply propaganda to scare people who don‚Äôt know what it is really like. No child is getting hormones or any other life changing procedures. Puberty blockers only delay puberty to give the child a chance to think about how they feel and figure out who they are without have to deal with the stress of going through potentially the wrong puberty. If the child changes their mind, they simply stop the puberty blockers and there is no long term impact. They will eventually go back to having their natural puberty and no harm done.

I‚Äôve also spoken to many young trans people in various stages of transitioning. None of them had it easy. Not a single person. Everything we have done for my son so far is just to get him on puberty blockers and it‚Äôs a long, complicated process. My son is suffering all the time because of this. It‚Äôs so hard to see him in pain. I wish we had a better system in place. Way to many young people cannot get help and end up doing things that are just tragic. Sorry for the rant. I hope I answered your questions. And feel free to ask me anything else. I‚Äôm always happy to help. 

Oh wow I also just realized it‚Äôs been a long time since this message was posted and I am so terribly sorry that I didn‚Äôt see it before now. Life has been crazy. 

I hope everyone is having a wonderful Holliday. Merry Christmas and happy new year to all! Here‚Äôs hoping that 2021 will be a better year than 2020! ü•∞

"A defense against the ""But.. men! In the womens bathroom!"" argument."	"1) They're women.
2) They're just as scared of, if not more scared.
3) Men who go in the women's bathroom just to prey arent trans. They're assholes.
4) Men with FTMs in the mens bathroom are doing just fine.
5) Yes, this can have issues, but it's not trans fault. Its idiots who think since they can ""identify as female"" for two seconds just to grope women.

Yes, this is petty."	"Trans people are, like, some of the least sexually threatening people I'm aware of next to aces. Especially when you understand the psychology behind rape. Using their body to dominate someone would be the exact opposite of feeling in control for most trans women. The whole argument shows how little they understand any of us. It's like an anti-argument!

It also shows a typical pattern in arguments stemming from bigotry: 

""But those people could be part of problem X!""

""So you also reject these other people that could be part of problem X?""

""No.""

""Why don't you do something about problem X instead of persecuting a bunch of people that aren't a part of it, and letting other people that are a part of it go unperturbed?""

""Look over here! It's a completely different argument! Blah blah blah...""

My ur-example is gay marriage. A common argument is that a same-sex couple can't have children. When you point out that they then must be opposed to sterile people marrying, you then get some bs and a quick change of subject. Same deal here. None of these people give a fuck about protecting women. What rapist would be deterred if their target went into a private, likely unmonitored room with only one exit? You would have to be panicking to think that a women's restroom would protect you! Not to mention that men aren't the only ones capable of sexual assault. The whole thing stinks of truthiness and misandry. I think it says a whole hell of a lot about the person that would make this bathroom argument.
Well when i present as fem and use the mens room the guys look at me weirdly and ive been asked a few times why im in the wrong bathroom and ive been told it makes them uncomfortable.


When i use the womens rest room no one really says anything to me but it does feel weird to me.


So i try not to use any bathrooms outside my house 


Im 1 month hrt  btws
<3

This is a common thought process, so I hope you're doing ok, and that you haven't been in any recent arguments...
It's honestly so stupid that a group of people can't pee because a diffrent group might pretend to be them for two seconds.
When trans people don‚Äôt get to use the correct bathroom they‚Äôre more likely to be assaulted‚Ä¶ even if they are in the correct bathroom they‚Äôre still more likely to be assaulted than to assault someone else.
I can't use the bathroom in public. I'm mtf. If I use the women's room, I'm terrified of being outed. If I use the men's, I get death glares and some guys who thinks it's okay to creep on me. I've learned to hold it.
Scary stuff
It was only ever a political dog whistle, as before it was just kind of accepted if you look female you used the woman‚Äôs room, and if there was a ‚Äúguy‚Äù who just threw on a dress and said he‚Äôs a chick as a way to assault or harrass, he would be dealt with."	xpge8b	trans	43	0.9	2022-09-27 13:10:35
Just having a lil ol' anxiety cry in the bathroom but at least I look cute???		"No cause for anxiety, girlfriend!  You're looking good!  ‚ù§Ô∏è

By the way, very trans-y tile colors in the bathroom!
Lol. I thought the same thing about the tiles. Girl you have support all around you. You got this!"	eeuud8	trans	44	0.92	2019-12-24 02:37:53
Why couldn't it be this simple to resolve the bathroom issue...		"That's a men's room to the left, a women's room to the right, and a family restroom in the middle.  
Because then we wouldn't get to discriminate. 
This wouldn't remove their objections to trans women in the women's washroom. I'm not going to self-segregate by using a family bathroom.
because not every store can afford to have 3 different bathrooms?
My school is amazing at this. Gender neutreal bathrooms everywhere
Okay..?
Well too bad. The vast majority of women don‚Äôt want to go to the bathroom with men. 

The vast majority of men don‚Äôt want their daughters to either.
As if stores didn't have to comply with other regulations...
What?
> The vast majority of women don‚Äôt want to go to the bathroom with men.

Well, trans women aren't men, so that's perfectly okay.

But if you want trans people to go to the washroom corresponding to their gender assigned at birth, then you want [this trans man](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buck_Angel#/media/File:Buck_Angel_Headshot.jpg) to go to the women's washroom. Right? Because he's got a vagina and his birth certificate originally said Female.
[deleted]
there is no reason behind what you are saying.

They have to comply withh numerous regulations, therefore stores can afford to have 3 rooms  dedicated to people pissing?
You said ¬´we¬ª
They don't want any trans people going to any bathroom. They would rather trans people not use anything they use. It's sad, really. 
They have XY chromosomes. They are biologically male. 

Not to mention a large number of them still have penises.....because they‚Äôre men....

And that ‚Äútrans man‚Äù has XX chromosomes, so yes.
There‚Äôs not always a perfect answer to things.
Stores already have to spend money to comply with regulations.  This is simply one more expenditure.  I'm sure stores complained when they had to meet certain requirements of the American Disabilities Act of 1990 to make their businesses more accessible to disabled people and to put parking reserved for the disabled as well.

Anyway, this was a proposed simple solution that doesn't deviate much from the regular way that bathrooms are built, and makes a place more trans friendly (rather than a trans person having to brave it in regular sex segregated  bathrooms) thus a cheaper and simpler solution.
Oh. I was being sarcastic. Responding by saying what a bigot would be thinking, I guess. If that makes sense. Sorry.

no they dont.
Just remember the /s
The only other thing (than constructing bathroom solutions) that  we can do is to make sure laws don't criminalize trans people using a bathroom other than to one's assigned sex at birth, and educate store managers (which would educate their employees) about trans people (as well as the police as to the rights of trans people) and hopefully convince them to be trans friendly.  A loud abusive asshole won't go far if everyone around them will not go with them.  Of course, that won't stop the traumatic event from happening in the first place.

In California, although not all stores have done it yet, stores are obligated by law to make any single stalled bathroom an ""all gender bathroom.""
Ahh you're right. I forgot about that.

Guy at the bar insulted me but apologized later	"Just wanted to share this with you because I had a really good work experience.

Last night I was helping out at a bar a few villages over. My boss and my coworkers were super friendly and just accepted me as a woman. It was the first day of my internship there as a Bar-back. So I basically assisted the 3 bartenders by washing the dishes, restocking the bar and getting new ice from the storage room.

When I started my shift it was relatively chilled and I even had time to talk to some of the regulars. Everyone I talked to was friendly and they didn't care that a very masc looking person introduced themselves by female name. And apparently the village where the bar is located is super conservative. One of the regulars even was so ""fascinated"" (I lack a better word) that he always called out to me for his next order even though I wasn't allowed to pour drinks.

Later that night it got a lot busier. I could barely keep up with washing the dishes and I still had to fetch stuff the girls needed. At one point there was a guy calling out to me because he wanted to order another beer. Since he didn't knew me he asked for my name and when I told him he asked if I'm kidding him. So when I returned to my tasks I assume that he had a discussion with his friends about me because a bit later when I came back from the storage room again one of them blocked my way a bit and asked me if I'm male or female. I think he muttered something about me being a guy and that I'm weird but I was honestly too busy to care. All I cared about at that moment was putting down the heavy beverage crate I was carrying and returning to the sink to wash the glasses which started to pile up while I was gone.

But here's the nice part from the title. Few hours later when I went to the storage room again he came out of the customer bathroom which is close nearby and he actually apologized. Totally didn't expect it but it was highly appreciated. Can't wait for my next shift"	"People that are trying to change have their hurdles. Huge on that person to realize they were in the wrong and put the effort to admit it. 

Awesome experience! Hope the job keeps working well for you!
That was a great outcome! I believe the way you handled it by just ignoring it was so mature of you and turned it into the better outcome!  üòò

GOD DAMN BATHROOMS	Apparently according to people in bathrooms I‚Äôm either a lesbian or a 10 year old boy and I can‚Äôt go into either.	"even IF you were a 10 yr old boy, you would have to pee too?? i dont understand phobes' obsession with making bathrooms sacred. its just a place to piss and shit. go in, do your stuff, then leave lol
I swear, every single bathroom needs to be a gender neutral, single toilet and sink setup. It would be more private, and NO ONE COULD SAY NOT TO PEE IN THEM BECAUSE THEY WOULDN'T BE GENDERED.
I hear ya, so annoying
Move to some really old city where space is a premium. The restaurants/shops can't afford to segregate their toilets, they literally don't have the space!
The only difference between men's and women's bathrooms is the urinal. Plus most men and nonbinary amabs sit down to urinate, so really having a gender neutral bathroom with a toilet and sink is no different than using the bathroom at home.
i know how it feels D:< my college campus is really confusing, because the map will show where gender neutral bathrooms are, but when I go to that spot, there isn't one. i really needed to go before class yesterday so I used the men's, (I'm female to nb) and it was honestly really scary, but luckily nobody said anything to me and I seemed to ""pass"". I'm sorry for your bad experiences with being called out. :(
Just line like 15 of those up and boom, you're set for a whole store!
I have a better bathroom idea have 3 bathrooms 1 female 1 male and 1 for people that are transphobic
What about non-binary or agender people?
I didn't thing about that part you know what 2 bathrooms 1 bathroom for people too use and the second one is for people that are queerpobic"	t0srdi	trans	40	0.94	2022-02-25 02:44:45
Using correct bathroom & passing?	"the title is super vague but i didnt know how else to word it, basically: any tips on passing as a man (mainly behaviorally but look-wise is very appreciated too) and/or to use the mens bathroom without stressing too hard? going back to school soon and im a bit on edge, any help is very appreciated!  


edit: hey thanks for all the tips! i may not respond all too much since i'm at more of a time crunch now so i dont have too much social media time, but it all still helped nonetheless!! have a great day"	"Try posting a selfie on [r/transpassing](https://www.reddit.com/r/transpassing/) to get tips on how to pass betters

In my experience men don‚Äôt give a fuck, they just go in and do their stuff so you do the same
Honestly if your passing even slightly just head to a stall and do your thing. Most men will be even hesitant to make eye contact for to long, so just looked and act the part and no one will even notice. 

+1 point of believability if you do the most lackluster washing of hands in your life. Basically hands to water and dry them off and get out of there.
Its all about attitude, a sense of belonging and most of all confidence. Also dont try fit in, just be there like any other boy. Dont linger at the mirror, dont stare ..(Its Rude), just go in, do what you came to do and finish without checking your hair and keep your phone in the pocket.
Masc presenting afab enby here: i have been mistaken for a teenage boy (i am like 5'2"") when i have been wearing a black hoodie (hood over the head, cause i had long hair) and generic sweatpants
layered clothes, try to seem relaxed, just go quickly and leave usually no one cares. people never asked me if i'm in the wrong bathroom (not a thing that happens here), but i saw someone on the internet say that when people asked him he would just muster the deepest voice he can and go ""what?"" and tbh that's a good tactic lol. (good luck!)
Going to share my personal life hack: lower your pants. Don‚Äôt sag them, necessarily. But men tend to wear their pants at their hips instead of near their waist. It genuinely makes a huge difference in your perceived shape.
I think the key, as with many things, is to -look- confident. Just go in, do the piss or whatever, wash ur hands, get out. Simple in theory. If you go in strong and dont go shifty and looking at the people there youll be fine. In my experiwnce nobody really cares who comes in as long as they can piss in peace u know
I‚Äôd wear a mask and not look anyone in the eyes really  that‚Äôs just how I‚Äôve been going to the bathroom as a amab
I get in and get out. No one questions it. If you know someone then dab them up lol
Guys are strictly business, just get in, do your shit, get out. The thing about not washing hands is maybe true but I always wash my hands and I haven‚Äôt exactly been called out for it. But yeah just do your shit and get out, no one but the biggest of pricks will give you shit
Just go in do your business and make sure you wash your hands. Most men don't interact in the bathroom or even make eye contact, as long as you just keep your head down a bit and don't make conversation you'll be fine. And if some dude tries to question you just give him the weirdest look you can and say ""I'm taking a piss, leave me alone""
honestly just pretend you don‚Äôt give a fuck, as most men do. most guys i know who use the public bathrooms just walk in, do their business, halfass washing their hands and walk out. i‚Äôm not saying you shouldn‚Äôt wash your hands, but chances are if you act like you belong- you will.
Just walk in and do your business like you're Just getting it over with , washing your hands, and getting out. 
If someone bugs you just say I'm having a shit it's not social hour.  Guys tend to be a bit rude when bothered. 

If you act like you belong there walk like you've been doing it your whole life, Most people aren't going to give you a second glance.
Transfem here. What helped me with anxiety was acknowledging ‚Äúthere‚Äôs feminine men and masculine women, there‚Äôs cis men that get looked at weird when they‚Äôre in the bathroom and cis women who get looked at weird when they‚Äôre in the bathroom.‚Äù In the end the only difference between you and a cis person is that right now you‚Äôre afraid someone might not think you belong there but even with some cis people they think the same, what do those cis people do? They‚Äôll get mad or frustrated or say something like ‚Äúyou‚Äôre fucking stupid I‚Äôm a dude/gal/etc‚Äù it‚Äôs all about building your own confidence is all
never heard of that subreddit so ill look into it! thank you so much!
oh goodness .... i may sacrifice that one point of believability haha but thanks for the tips anyhow!
It, uh... *horrifies* me that most men don't wash their hands.

And then you have to shake their hands later.

\*shudders\*

And yes, this is from personal experience.
alright, thanks! :\]
Yep agreed, honestly 90% of guys go into the washroom and get out.  If there is conversation it‚Äôs ‚ÄúHey how‚Äôs it going?‚Äù ‚ÄúNot bad thanks have a good one‚Äù while washing hands and that‚Äôs it lol.
maybe i'll try out the hoodie thing too then! thanks ! :D
thanks for all the tips + the tactic!! might use it if i ever need lul
yeah that makes sense, confidence helps a lot in most things- thanks!
we have to wear masks anyway so i think that'll help, thanks a lot! :D
lul thanks!
Do it on an alt account so you don‚Äôt get chasers on main.
Former cishet male speaking, and still use the men's room bc I don't even come close to passing as a women, just in, do whatever you need to and then leave.

I think the only thing that makes people uncomfortable is other dudes looking at your dick, that's it.

If you use a urinal, just focus on that. I like to focus on the blinky light on the auto flush valve while going. I'll count how many seconds between each blink, whatever.

But in general no one would care. I remember in my past a women accidentally coming in and being so apologetic and one guy was like, ""no worries, go ahead if the other ones full""
 People (men in particular) just brush off the idea that there couldn't have been any splash or something like that because my hands aren't wet. Thus they just do a simple rinse off and call it a day. If your lucky they will at least use some hand sanitizer if even available.
alright!
Prior to COVID, I don't think the hand sanitiser was something that would have been considered in those cases.

What bothers me the most about shaking hands without them having been washed first ... is they've just been grabbing their junk.

And the simple rinse off you mentioned is at least a step in the right direction. The sheer number of men who use the toilet and then... just walk out of the bathroom. Very awkward in a workplace, especially when they're someone highly-ranked and I come across them later in the workplace and my brain is going 'hahaha, you're fucking disgusting!' :D

I think I‚Äôve reached the ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù phase of my transition‚Ä¶	"I think I‚Äôve reached the ‚Äúuncanny valley‚Äù phase of my transition‚Ä¶

I personally don‚Äôt think I look that different from when I started 10months ago, but apparently it‚Äôs happening. 

I was traveling by train over the weekend and had a 2hr layover at North Station in Boston so I figured I go grab a cocktail or two to burn the time. So I‚Äôm sitting at this bar at the station, having a wonderful conversation with a cute female tattoo artist who‚Äôs also waiting for her train. Eventually I ask the bartender where the bathrooms are and she tells me where they are and that they have key codes to get in. Without making any assumptions she gives me the codes to both bathrooms (I‚Äôm by myself so she didn‚Äôt need to do that). I wasn‚Äôt presenting overtly fem or even wearing any makeup (I‚Äôd say my look these days is fem leaning androgyny. But clearly she wasn‚Äôt sure which bathroom I wanted/ needed. After I got back I thanked her for her consideration and she just smiled and said, I‚Äôve got your back. 

Put a huge smile on my face. Who knew something as simple as asking where the bathrooms where could make such a positive impact on my day. Lol. 

That was only one of the several interesting interactions I had this weekend (all positive) so I guess I must be doing something right."	"That‚Äôs awesome. :)

We never see the changes on ourselves like other people do. So you‚Äôre doing pretty good Id say.
When a waiter calls the rest of the table ""sir"" or ""ma'am"" but then gets to me and says ""my friend"" I know I'm doing something right.
That is sooo awesome!  I remember lighting up when the uncanny valley phased started for me and it was a crapshoot if someone referred to me as he or she... despite just being in boy mode.  Its like a lightbulb turns on in your head, your heart flutters, and you realize ITS REALLY HAPPENING!

ATTN: read if ur trans	I was told when I enrolled at my school that I was supposed to use the gender neutral bathrooms. I told them that‚Äôs illegal, they can‚Äôt make me do that, I can and I will use the men‚Äôs room. STAND UP FOR URSELF IF UR NOT BEING TREATED EQUALLY	"Yeah, don't let people tell you what bathroom you can and can't use, your gender is yours to decide, nobody else's and being bullied for it is NEVER an ok thing, and should NEVER be ignored or even accepted.
Yeah, even though my school says right in the ""Student Handbook"" that I can use whatever bathroom I want, I've been ""encouraged"" to use the gender-neutral bathroom. Fun story, my school is laid out like a 2-story doughnut. There's one gender-neutral bathroom. The hallways are currently one way (for distancing). So...once I had to use the bathroom and wound up having to circle the entire school 3 times to do it...
Well hold up there for a sec, if my gender was mine to decide, I‚Äôd decide not to be in this fuck up
no no, your sex (your body I suppose) must be transitioned to be of your choosing, but your gender is how you identify, and that is what you can choose. meaning, you may have been born in a body you dislike, but you can still identify as whatever you feel you are, and can use whatever bathroom you feel you need to use.

Then again, it sucks ass to have to go into a woman‚Äôs restroom and remember that my family doesn‚Äôt see me for who I am, that I will always have to live with a body I feel inferior in, and that it‚Äôs gonna take me years to get to any kind of transition goal.

AAAAAA	"i've been feeling extremely dysphoric over the past couple days. it's not like it hasn't been this bad before, but its never been this strong for more than one day in a row

I can't even look at the mirror without crying - honestly I'm too nervous to enter the bathroom at all.

I tried everything I usually do to make myself feel better - I wore masculine clothes, I wore my homemade binder, I tried playing video games to take my mind off of it, but I still feel like garbage.

&#x200B;

I saw my GP earlier today to see if I could start hrt soon, but the closest endocrinologist is too far for me to get to on my own (>!and I don't think my transphobic mother would help me travel that far anyway!<), so I can't start yet. It's probably good that I give myself more time to think it through, since I've only been certain of my gender for a couple months or so. At the same time, I've seen so many other trans folk talk about how they *regret* not starting sooner, and literally not one person said ""I'm glad I waited"".

I'm not afraid of starting HRT too late. I'm afraid of being stuck living with a woman's body for who knows how long. I'm afraid of spending years talking with a wrong voice, forcing myself to dress in the wrong clothes, introducing myself with my deadname, being constantly called ""she"", being seen as a woman when I'm the only one who knows that's not what I am.

&#x200B;

>!I also hate the thought of continuing to hide from my mother. She knows there's something up with me and I really wish I could just come out to her, but I'm worried that if I tell her the truth now she'll make it harder for me to transition down the road.!<"	Being trans is hard. But one thing you have to remember is you aren‚Äôt alone. You have the entire trans community here to support you every step of the way. A couple months is probably enough time to be certain about your gender. The only reason you may feel that you are not sure could very well be impostor syndrome. You will be ok im sure if it. Just don‚Äôt give up. My dms are open if you need someone to talk to. Im 16 years old so im around your age. Don‚Äôt hesitate to dm and I will be back with you as soon as I can.	szf5nw	trans	37	0.98	2022-02-23 11:22:33
Mom keeps on recommending ways for me to be feminine and it‚Äôs extremely annoying	"TW: transphobia. 

Context: I‚Äôm FTM he/him 

For the past couple of days, my mother has been recommending ways for me to be more feminine, and it‚Äôs annoying af, not to mention dysphoria inducing. 

She recently got the materials to dye her hair at home, and has been on a DIY hair kick all week. Ever since she started managing her own hair, she‚Äôs been telling me how ‚Äúpretty‚Äù I‚Äôd look with a streak of blond or purple. How nice it‚Äôd be if I dyed my hair with her. 

Yesterday we were talking about weddings, because the topic came up between my sister and mother. Mid convo she slyly hinted at how nice I‚Äôd look in a wedding dress, and was trying to get my sister to agree. 

Today, just now actually, I walked in on her doing her hair in the bathroom, and she offered to ‚Äúpin mine up‚Äù, and style it nice and pretty. 

I don‚Äôt know where any of this is coming from. I‚Äôve been out for almost a whole year. My mother uses my name and pronouns frequently, and has even corrected other family members about them in the past. We‚Äôve had numerous talks about my gender and how being misgendered makes me feel. What changed? I wish I knew. I tried talking to her about it after the ‚Äúwedding dress‚Äù incident, but she just dismissed me and called me sensitive. 

I‚Äôm just so frustrated and saddened by this sudden change. I needed to vent. Hopefully I can get some answers to her behavior soon."	"I hope she's not drinking the TERF fresh-aid. Hopefully it's just some temporary thing, and she regains her senses soon. Besides, she has to know you'd absolutely rock it in a tux.
That sounds annoying as hell, and that's even with the thing that I'm seemly reversed on f vs m polarity! Real sorry that's happening tho. It seems like several other people are nailing the advice you need, just figured I could offer a shred of validation
Dude it would be anoying for anyone, can't imagine for a guy. Try to help her see that, you are your own person and she needs boundaries
Sorry, couldn‚Äôt read the post. Just here to respond to the subject. 

Tell her to stop. I have had to do that with a lot of people. Eventually they stop.
That's just flat out wrong. Sounds like she has internalized some feelings about you being a man, and has taken to snide offhand comments to express it. So unfair to you.

If you tell someone that what they did hurt you, they don't get to say otherwise. They don't get to call you too sensitive. That's just them excusing their shitty behavior.
I think she‚Äôs just trying to be more supportive of ya. Just politely tell her that you appreciate what she‚Äôs trying to do, but don‚Äôt really like it. Maybe ask her why she‚Äôs doing this all the sudden?


If that doesn‚Äôt work, tell her that you‚Äôre not just being sensitive and it‚Äôs really just making it worse. If she doesn‚Äôt understand that, then I‚Äôm out of ideas, and sometimes the best way is with sheer honesty and no sugarcoating with a strong ‚Äúno‚Äù.
I would love this. She wants you to be one of the girls. Great bonding effort. Corrected below after op stating pronoun.
I get similar from my mom a lot. I‚Äôm not out to her as a guy yet (she can‚Äôt keep her mouth shut and outed me at work when I came out to her as bisexual, so now she doesn‚Äôt get to know I‚Äôm trans until AFTER I‚Äôm out at work) but it‚Äôs still super annoying. 

Solidarity, bro.
Lmao thank you, I appreciate that ü´∂ I really hope it is temporary. I‚Äôm going to have another talk with her tomorrow to see where this is all coming from.
Thanks for the support. Yeah, I‚Äôm having a talk with her today about it. Hopefully we can get to some sort of resolution
Hopefully she does stop. I‚Äôm having another conversation with her tomorrow to see where this all came from. Thanks for commenting and giving advice despite not being able to read the post ü´∂
Unfortunately I believe she‚Äôs being the opposite of supportive. She‚Äôs trying to feminize me even though she knows how uncomfortable it makes me. 

You‚Äôre right tho, I should just ask her again and be firm about my disapproval in her behavior if she keeps this up. Thanks for the advice.
OP is FTM.
Yeah. I should have said why I couldn‚Äôt read the post. It triggers me. I can‚Äôt stand it when people do that.
Wait I think I misread the post. What are you‚Äôre pronouns? If they‚Äôre She/Her, then I said is what I meant to say. If they‚Äôre not, then she‚Äôs just trying to convince you to not be trans, in which case not skipping the steps that lead up to the hard ‚Äúno‚Äù may be difficult.
After reading half the thread this was stated. I'm sorry op, this sucks
Oh shoot I‚Äôm sorry. I should have added a TW. I‚Äôll add it to the text now.
Sorry! On top of forgetting the trigger warning I also forgot to make it clear that I am FTM, so my pronouns are He/Him, hence the discomfort around my mothers suggestions.
Lol, I was confused as well, since context was missing.

I'm always put in groups of only women. We were in dairy tonight unloading cheese and yogurt and there's just a bunch of little things collecting that makes me feel like I'm normal and saw as a woman.

Whether it's the manager coming by saying great work ladies! The two small times tonight I accidentally bumped into two other girls boobs trying to navigate the stacks of stuff we were unpacking and both times they apologized to me. Or how a girl I worked with was talking to me about being on her period just little things and this is all just today stuff like this is normal now I have chats with other women in the bathroom, we've talked about makeup, taste in men, even pervy jokes more than I expected on that one actually lol 

It's just I feel I'm just one of the gals unlike my last job where I was I saw as a freak constantly misgendered I pass and here coming into the job as a woman I'm accepted"	Congrats girl!!!	x5dra3	trans	40	0.96	2022-09-04 04:21:33

A small validation today.	Sometimes the smallest gestures can be so validating. As I was coming home from the harbor, I went into a Walgreens to use the bathroom and there an employee has to unlock it for you to prevent shoplifting. Now let's get one thing straight, I've been having trouble with voice feminization, so its still very deep and masculine. The employee there went and opened the women's room for me and didn't ask a single question about my gender. Alot of people do, but this guy didn't. Small gesture, but it made my day for sure.

Are you a boy or a girl? /Being a trans guy in Public/	"I'm 3 months on hormones and i couldn't be happier! But there is just one little thing. Every time i'm in public i'm afraid. Sometimes when i talk to strangers, they ask if i'm a boy or a girl. I just say i'm a girl because i don't want people to start judging me.. i don't pass too well, after some minutes people can easily figure out i'm a girl, because of my voice. And every time when someone asks my name i just say my 'dead name' to avoid confusion but i hate it..

Also, i'm really afraid using the man's bathroom in public. But using the woman's bathroom is getting really uncomfortable, because everybody gives me a weird look when i go in. I don't know what to do. I really want to be myself but i just can't, i'm afraid of it.

Do you have any advice how to be more confident about my identity and stop hiding it? I would be really thankful."	"If people are asking, then at least you‚Äôve got something going for you.  Sometime when you‚Äôre feeling a little more confident, just say you‚Äôre a boy and give them your real name.  See what happens.  Confidence is something you have to practice, but it gets easier each time you do it.

You‚Äôve got this, bro.

(I say this as a woman who is far too chicken to start using the women‚Äôs bathroom, so maybe I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about... üòÇ)
Tell yourself every day in the mirror how handsome and strong you are. Remind yourself that you're a man, and people will recognize that soon. If you're getting people asking your gender, that's a good sign.

You're probably in a bit of ""gender limbo"" and that's okay. Let people know who you are!
Are they Prof. Oak at the beginning of a Pokemon game? Tell them to mind their business.
Like the previous responder said, if people are asking, there's some level of uncertainty that makes them ask. I've had a different  experience than you have, I started T last year at 31 but was passing before that and got weird looks using the women's restroom pretty much any time there was someone else in there already. So for me, it was kind of reversed. Once I started using the men's restroom, no more weird looks, and most guys keep their heads down and go on about their business. I always use a stall even though the urinals are perfectly fine choice, but for me, I'm not at that level of confidence yet. I kind of lucked out with when I decided to start using the men's restroom, I changed up my job and when I started my new job I just identified as male and starting using the men's restroom, the fact that I'm trans was never even brought up by hr or anything like that. I've told a few people that I've developed friendships with but for the most part, people just see me as another guy that works here. To help boost your confidence do things that help you feel more masculine. It's different for everyone. For me, I like to work out, get dirty and work on/build things, mountain bike, and fish. When I look in the mirror I tell myself I'm a handsome mofo, and make sure my scraggly bit of facial hair looks well groomed. For some guys, shaving and doing other more ""masculine"" personal hygiene activities help them feel more manly. Try things out and see what works for you. As far as using the men's room, come up with a plan for when (and where) you want to start using the men's room and stick to it (the anxiety is much less if you have an stp, btw, and practice before using it in public to make sure you're confident and comfortable with using it, accidents do happen and they can send your anxiety level through the roof). If a unisex restroom is available, use that if you aren't comfortable using the men's room where you are. As far as people asking, tell them that you're male. It's your identity, if they don't think you fit the bill, who cares, they aren't you. You need to gain confidence in yourself and be who you are and enjoy it, other people's approval will come in time, but if you're sounding like you're trying to convince yourself, other people are less likely to believe you too. The nervousness and anxiety around it will go away with time and as your body continues to change. If you ever want someone to chat with I'm usually around and more than happy to share my experiences or any tips that I may have. Good luck and stick with it!
1. Confidence is something you will have to work on, when they ask say boy and give your real name. They will probably just think you are a effeminate male. Seriously if they are asking they probably think you are a guy but don't want to offend you if you are a woman. Just go with it.

2. Men really won't be upset over a woman using their bathroom (generally), that is if they perceive you as female. Though I would still be weary and keep a knife or pepper spray because some creeps may try something in a secluded bathroom in a bad part of town if they perceive you as a woman. Though once you pass pretty well then I wouldn't be too worried, which again if they are asking it is probably a safe bet to say that most see you as a guy. 

Personally I can't wait to use the woman's restroom but it seems that is a bit more of a hot button issue than using the men's. Though I am light years from passing... "	8zyphl	trans	36	0.96	2018-07-18 19:41:02
GOP governor on NC-style Bathroom Bill: ‚ÄúWhy? Why would we? Why would anybody need it? Is it an issue?		"Clearly Bevins apparently learned from North Carolina‚Äôs Gov. Pat McCrory train-wrecked political career ‚Äî a gamble that didn‚Äôt pay dividends even though Trump carried the state.

> Gov. Bevins has done a complete about-face since earlier this year when he joined nearly a dozen other states in a lawsuit to stop the federal government from issuing trans equality rulings for bathroom access.

This isnt an about face. In both cases he's opposing additional regulations, for or against doesn't matter. I doubt he cares about transpeople or hates them. He's just being a small government Republican
Up next: trans equivalent of log cabin republicans?
>He's just being a small government Republican

I wish more small government Republicans would be like him though, and not consider it to be one of those essential functions of government to fuck trans people over endlessly
Damn few of those around these days. The federal GOP politicians seem to want a government small enough to fit in Putin's pocket.
There's a difference between being a ""small government Republican"" and being a small government Republican whose actions are actually consistent with wanting small government. The latter is rarely observed."	5hvss8	trans	35	0.95	2016-12-12 09:45:12
After 4 months of working with corporate and HR, we finally have a gender neutral bathroom in our building!		"How did you start the process? I‚Äôm trying to get one at my work and Idk where to start.
Ah, Corporate, the absolute biggest road block to accomplishing anything at all. Congrats on beating them in to submission!
Win
So I work for a giant corporate with hundreds of hubs and offices (think brown trucks! Haha). They have a very inclusive trans policy, so I knew a bathroom wouldn't be an impossible request. I issued an HR request at the corporate level (skip the local hr team) which had to go through their legal team, plant engineering, etc.

Do your homework! Basically, I had already done all the investigation for corporate so I figured it was 50/50. I had already located a possible bathroom that would be easy to switch over and wouldn't cost much money.  Probably most importantly, my building has 3 trans employees and I framed it as ""get ahead of this issue now before it becomes a problem!""

 $$ and lawsuits, at the end of the day, are basically all they care about! Haha
This ^ I need to know. Company I'm at all restrooms are single one anyways I don't see the point of men/women
Sweet yea thank you I‚Äôll look into it. I didn‚Äôt want to just go to my local HR I know it would just get pushed into the trash.
I don‚Äôt see the point either. I‚Äôve been in both here and the women‚Äôs bathroom has 7 stalls and men‚Äôs it‚Äôs 2 with 2 urinals.

Perhaps not. But it‚Äôs like cis people who are obviously their agab putting their pronouns in their work email signatures. It‚Äôs a clear but unobtrusive statement of support/intent.

used the womens restroom for the first time.	so i was on a road trip and we needed to stop for gas and bathroom break. i was in the back seat and just woke up. my tired ass opened the door to the womens restroom and then realized wait im mtf pre everything and havent shaved in 2 days (not too bad but visibly facial stubs). so i went into the male restroom. piss, shit, and vomit were on the walls, floor, and stalls. so i walk out and quickly go into the womens hoping to whatever gods are out there, that i wouldnt be seen. i did my bathroom thing and waited about 5 mins because i heard other people in there and i didnt want to be seen (longest 5 minutes of my life). i walk out and act like nothing happened but, on the inside, i felt so euphoric, terrified, happy, and other emotions i couldnt describe.

As a sidenote why are men's bathrooms so disgusting? Like does nobody ever clean them or what?
Certainly seems like it.
I don't know. It was such a difference. And I assume that's the case for most bathrooms.
Yup, at school today had to use the men's because the disabled ones were full (disabled ones cuz unisex) and there was bloody carrot looking vomit all over the wall - just disgusting

The story of how my ex called the cops on me when I came out as transgender.	"Okay so back in May of 2019 my brain finally put it together that I may in fact be transgender. I talked to a mtf friend of mine about it and she helped me organize my thoughts about it and agreed that I'm transgender. 

That was all well and good, however I then had to tell my now ex about it since we were still in an online ""relationship"" at the time (I put it in quotes because it was so toxic and horrible that I don't consider it an actual relationship anymore). So I texted her about it.

She. Was. Pissed. She thought I was joking at first, but when I said I was serious she went full transphobe on me. She has a track record for freaking out of things don't go her way, going as far as making threats of self harm and suicide if I didn't do what she says (she doesn't actually hurt herself btw, just says she will to manipulate me). I asked my mtf friend what to do because I was terrified and she said that I gotta tell her that I need a little space to think about it and then cut her off. So I did just that.

About half an hour later two police officers knock on my door wanting to speak with me. Apparently my ex called them so they could ""check on me"". Yeah right... I could tell she was trying to scare me into going back to her and I knew better than to do that. However I had to explain wtf was going on. Since the idea of lying to the police sounded like a really bad idea, I was forced to come out as transgender to my parents (who didn't understand and were pretty transphobic about it) AND the police. I was not at all ready to be out of the egg. I just figured that out about myself earlier that day! 

The next day after the dust had settled I got an email from my ex. She was trying to feed me some kind of bullshit excuse as to why she freaked out. Apparently it was because she once knew someone who was ""transrender"" that bullied her in the past. Thats not a typo btw, she stated it several times in the email. I Googled it to see what that was. Spoiler alert: It's not even a fucking word. On top of that, when I showed my mtf friend the email, it turned out that she got the same excuse from her after she harassed her for being trans. That was the last straw. I replied to the email with a declaration of our break-up and I never talked to that bitch ever again.

And then she hacked into my Google account and send me creepy pics of herself to me through my own email address. :) 

Dear Google,
Could you please make it easier for me to change my password and re-secure my account? I had to ask around on Discord, while in full panic mode, for help figuring out that stuff. 

I did get my account back, thankfully. I never heard from that psycho again. 

Anyway I hope y'all have an easier time coming out than I did lol. That was a Tuesday that I'll never forget. Scary af but also a major turning point in my life. Things haven't gotten much easier, but my life has definitely been gradually improving. When I was with my ex I was forced to sit in my room for 8 -10 hours a day watching videos with her like cats mating or pimple popping or the same fucking Warriors MAP over and over and over again (I don't read or like Warriors and she'd get mad at me for not understanding what was going on in the video). No food. No bathroom breaks. Not even allowed to talk to friends or family. That was my life for two years. 

Now that I'm free of that nightmare I got a job, a driver's permit, friends I can hang out with, an HRT prescription, parents that finally understand and respect me, started practicing witchcraft, and best of all... I got a new boyfriend who actually loves and cares about me and my health. He doesn't force me to do things I'm not comfortable with, doesn't guilt trip me, showers me with love and affection (as I do with him), and treats me like a human being who has basic needs and NOT like an object to toy with. He's as sweet and snuggly as can be a I love him so much! I love you, Ray! <3

Sorry this post was so long. That was unintentional lol. I hope y'all have a wonderful day! Trans rights! ^^/"	"I'm glad to hear you're in a better place in your life now. Good luck with the future. :)

It sucks that there's not much i can do to deal with dysphoria	"i just wanna wake up with a beard already

&#x200B;

whenever i'm dysphoric there's only two ways to deal with it - either play video games and mindlessly browse the internet to try and keep my mind off it, or hide in the bathroom and dress masc for like five minutes, before I have to pack everything up so my family doesn't see.

i'm slowly taking steps to get hrt soon but i'm very very impatient and i wish i didn't have to wake up each day knowing that i'm not able to actively change my body to be the way i need it to be"	"Have you tried (and goodness kick me for saying this) being... ""Quirky"" around your family? Like using that as an excuse to dress in masculine clothes and try to act like yourself even if you can say it one for one? I know it's a really really dumb and messed up thing to have to do, but maybe it could help you handle the dysphoria?
Hey, I know it sucks right now but I am in the same position as you. A small tip that helps me with dysphoria are: you know that gap between your breasts? Press down on it and boom your chest is flat. (Sounds strange but it really helps me) 
But keep going on! You will get through this and will one day look how you feel. I believe in
You <3
Fortunately my family doesn't pressure me to be hyper feminine 24/7, but even with the most masculine clothes I currently own I'll still look undeniably female. I can use mascara to make ""facial hair"" but I have to wash it off before I leave the bathroom. Thanks for you help anyway \^\_\^
Well hey, you're gaining ground! While I can't help with the facial hair (honestly I wish I could just give you mine, I hated it before I even knew I was trans üòÖ) the fact you're dressing how you want is good! Plus maybe a more boyish hair cut and stuff might help too! (If you don't have one already) My biggest advice is aiming for gender neutral, I guess? I'm not very sure on how to help, since I was always a very feminine. But congrats on making progress"	tcd9bu	trans	38	0.97	2022-03-12 10:00:26
Security guard arrested after forcing trans woman out of store bathroom		"Ha! Dumb bastard. That's what that guard gets.
Security guard to trans woman: ‚ÄúYou guys cannot keep coming in here and using our women‚Äôs restroom. They did not pass the law yet.‚Äù

I mean, honestly, if there's no law saying you CAN'T then doesn't the law default to ""you can"" unless you're breaking a different law at the same time?
well, no. I hope we see proper legislation that prevents issues like this happening to begin with. we don't need more arrests, just equal rights.
Yes, with everything. If something isn't specifically prohibited then it's allowed. Be careful though, some states have enacted laws similar to England's ""breach of the peace"" law where you can be arrested for anything likely to cause a breach of the peace, and unfortunately going in the wrong bathroom can cause a breach of the peace because someone could get a little upset.

Though just to clarify for others reading, if you are in England, you use the bathroom of the gender you are presenting as, as that is what the law states.
wouldn't a security guard or someone shouting that a man is in the women's be a breach of peace?
Yes, in states that have these laws, that's what I meant. Louisiana is the only state I'm aware of that has such a law but I know there are others, I think NJ maybe."	4k1hua	trans	36	0.95	2016-05-19 08:22:37

Thanksgiving made me face how much my family sucks.	"Ever since I came out, my family has been doing the bare minimum ‚Äî less than really, I‚Äôm being generous ‚Äî while I bend over backwards to try to accommodate them. 

I agreed to use a gender neutral version of my preferred name instead of the masculine version I chose, I stopped fighting them over using they/them for me when I use he/him (and this is only when they know I can hear them, they use she/her when they think I can‚Äôt), and while I sometimes desperately try to make them see that their far right politics hurts me, I usually apologize or avoid the subject as much as possible. 

Now, somehow I‚Äôd managed to delude myself into thinking that, just because they started to be less queerphobic in front of me meant they were making progress. Thanksgiving took that mirage and tore it to shreds. 

See, for some reason I was trying to mental gymnastics my way out of admitting how much they hate queer people like me. Sure, my uncle knowingly deadnamed me in front of a group of queer friendly people, sure my dad compared us to rapists and murderers, sure my aunt believes it‚Äôs worse to be gay or trans than a thief, sure my mom works for a college that actively discriminated against non cishets, but surely that didn‚Äôt mean they actually hated people like me, right? Right? I mean, yeah my dad had threatened to throw me out at one point, and all of them voted for and listened to far right ideologists, but‚Ä¶. 

You may see what I‚Äôm getting at. I loved‚Ä¶ love‚Ä¶ my family. I want them to be good people, desperately! I see all their good qualities, and can‚Äôt help but think of how much I love them, and suddenly the fact that if they didn‚Äôt know me they‚Äôd think of me as just another ‚Äúone of THEM‚Äù is really, really hard to swallow. 

But, at Thanksgiving‚Ä¶ there wasn‚Äôt just a straw that broke my camel‚Äôs back, it was a fucking ton of bricks. 

I was in the bathroom, so my aunt, uncle, grandmother, and parents didn‚Äôt know I could hear them speaking. They were gossiping about a ‚Äúhomosexual‚Äù (technically they said it in code cause my uncle doesn‚Äôt want his kids to know queer people exist), and how they disliked him, which ok, I expected that. I was upset, but it was nothing new. 

Then‚Ä¶ my grandmother made a somewhat racist remark, and my uncle made a joke out of it. And they all laughed. 

I felt stupid. I FEEL stupid. That wasn‚Äôt just a sort of ‚Äúoh they‚Äôre evangelicals, it‚Äôs their culture to be homophobic/transphobic‚Äù thing I could mentally do flips around. Nope. This was something that SHOULD have been obviously wrong to them. They didn‚Äôt care. Don‚Äôt care.

As disappointed as I am in them, I can‚Äôt help but feel disappointed with myself as well. Maybe it was wrong of me to try to see the best in them. I don‚Äôt know. What I do know is I don‚Äôt want to make excuses for them anymore. I don‚Äôt know how or when I‚Äôll get out of here, but I don‚Äôt want to be a part of this facade anymore. 

I‚Äôm tired of all of it. 

Thanks for reading this mess.

TL;DR: tricked myself into thinking my family was making progress towards not being bigots; they made racist jokes during thanksgiving which shattered that fantasy."	"It's time to leave.

I am so sorry that is happening to you. People for the most part really suck. Hate that I feel that way but I am becoming more and more jaded all the time.

I want to. I‚Äôm not very independent yet sadly, and I don‚Äôt know how to get there. 

I‚Äôm very anxious, and depressed; as you can imagine my home life isn‚Äôt making that easier, but it makes getting out and planning harder. I feel like I should be competent at things, but I get overwhelmed very easily. Im going to therapy but tbh it doesn‚Äôt seem to be helping a lot :/
Me too. I‚Äôm a bit lucky that at least one of my siblings supports me, but it does make it harder cause I don‚Äôt wanna leave him behind
Hey, oppressive systems hurt everyone who isn‚Äôt at the top, even if you aren‚Äôt a direct target! And tbh I relate to the jaded thing - I feel like a jaded old dude and I‚Äôm only 21 lmao
I mean, living with them is making me miserable, and I‚Äôve talked to them extensively about how they hurt me and they‚Äôre not willing to change. What‚Äôs a better solution? I‚Äôd love to have them pull their heads outta their asses, but that‚Äôs clearly not gonna happen‚Ä¶.
I wish you luck on your journey
When our families suck we choose a new one. Find yourself a strong friend group you can rely on and work with them to gain independence together. Roomies is the new norm and they can be the best people you know. Sorry about your family. I held everything in until I was old enough to be independent so my heart goes out to anyone who comes out younger
You can still keep contact with him though! Im sure he would understand you wanting to leave :) ‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs a double edged sword, we each live on both sides and find love in the middle, ask the questions to them that are open and that help you figure out the thought process they have, and as well the feelings they have towards it. 

We are different species within the one of human kind. 
So try to find the common ground and don‚Äôt automatically feel attacked if they say something you may not agree with. Ease your will as Pluto said it very well ‚Äú we ceased to wear our prosperity with moderation ‚Äú 

My parents did the same, and at first I felt exactly like you, but through discussion they made me see their side and we had some differences but we also had similarities, they won‚Äôt call the name I choose because they have a love attached to the name and who I was then, but it didn‚Äôt mean they didn‚Äôt love me.  They just didn‚Äôt want everything of that ‚Äú person ‚Äú to die, and I respected it. 

I guess point blank period is we need to stop assuming that it should be a instantaneous ‚Äú yes we accept every change ‚Äú and see both sides and help each other understand as we both want to live peacefully and in order to do so we both need to make sacrifices to what we want
Thank you

"Cis woman, accused of being a ""boy,"" was manhandled and kicked out of a women's bathroom; sues"		"It is quite clear, in order for bathroom bills to work, everybody, including cis people, will need to be subject to a pants inspection. The next time a legislator proposals a bathroom bill, shove this down their throat.
OMG the comments on that article. I normally avoid commenting but I just couldn't. Those are the most bigoted discriminatory people I've seen in a long time.

They're essentially saying if you want to be female you need to wear feminine cloths and makeup (but they can apparently forgive the hair). ^If ^^only ^^it ^^was ^^^that ^^^^easy.
This is a solid mix of awful and glorious.
I'm saving this article for when they bring up bathroom bills in Florida again. 
so tru.  To me, it lites the idea that what really drives the bigotry is some sort of defense of the binary on the part of these peeps. It's a clu to me when someone who isn't even trans, but lesbian, gets bashed, essentially, just for their *gender* presentation.It kinda shows to me that we have more in common with the LGB than a lotta peeps tend to think, as far as sharing bashers goes anyway... 
Very Interesting, Lesbian and trans men in the early stages have a similar gender presentation. Just like fem gay men and crossdressers have a similar presentation. Which is completely understandable. I never thought of it that way.
Almost every trans man goes through a stage where people think they are a butch lesbian. Some ""used to be"" butch lesbians even. All kinds of overlap.
That whole butch lesbian stage. I am always trying to guess whos trans masculine, non binary, or just butch with outbeing rude."	39w5u3	trans	37	0.94	2015-06-15 07:56:12
"So milo wanted to keep trans women out of the girls bathroom to ""protect"" young girls"	So who's going to protect young boys from him in the men's bathroom?	"[it's absolutely crazy what he had to say about it on twitter](https://mobile.twitter.com/account/suspended)
Milo cares about himself and himself alone.  The only people that believe otherwise, voted for a fascist cheeto (and believed every bit of shit he shoveled on them too).
Projection? 
I always fall for that, but it's always funny. 
Can you remember what it said? Because the account is dead now.
It usually is. Just look at all of the right wing mouth pieces who have flat out admitted that they would have loved to have had an excuse to perv on girls in the bathrooms and dressing rooms as their ""proof"" that predators will take advantage. They're just so self absorbed that the idea that most others don't feel the same way as them never even crosses their minds. It's all just ""locker room talk"" as far as they're concerned. 
Milo was banned from twitter so there's a running joke where people link to his former twitter profile with ""you wont believe how he responded to this!"" but it's always ""this account has been suspended.""

Wholesome bathroom stories please	"I just used the men's bathroom at work for the first time and it terrified me. I do not pass and I'm not out at work. Gladly I was completely alone at the time.

Do you have any wholesome bathroom stories to cheer me up and maybe encourage me?"	"I am a trans guy and sometimes I present kind of feminine, and once I left my purse in the washroom. I swear, once this literal biker gang came into the washroom and as I was leaving one of them said in a really gruff voice: ""HEY!! You left your purse."" and he handed it to me and smiled. Honestly though, I felt really good after that.
A few months after coming out to my (now ex) wife, we were traveling & stopped at a truck stop for fuel. I needed to use the restroom. I was clearly trying to present feminine, in skinny jeans and a blouse, but I have no illusions about passing. As I approached the women's restroom, the woman ahead of me opened and held the door for me.
I'm transfem but pre everything. I went into the women's restroom and another woman entered the stall next to me. After a minute she asks if I had a pad. Since I believe in being prepared, and having need myself, I gave her one of my pads. She came out while I was washing my hands and said thanks. I said you're welcome and there's no hiding my voice. She looked me over, realized, and said it was a good thing one of us was prepared for our woman stuff. We wound up finishing our shopping and having a little snack together.
I'm always worried about using the men's room but I've been doing it for 10+ years and I've never had an issue. When I travel with my husband he comes in with me and lingers near the sinks until I finish. <3
Wholesome bathroom stories: I‚Äôve been using men‚Äôs restrooms since before HRT and even before I began using an stp in public (about 5 years) and not once has anyone shown any signs that they cared that I was in there. Men generally, in my experience, ignore everyone else and get on with things.
honestly guys just going ‚Äúsorry dude‚Äù for being in the way in a small bathroom fills my testosterone levels so much
I'm still boymoding everywhere, but one coworker started calling me sweetheart and peanut since I started growing my hair out and shaving regularly. Friday I had my hair in a half bun and wearing a visor, walked into the restroom while he was washing his hands. He glanced over to see who was walking in, did a double take and said ""you're in the wrong bathroom."" It's mostly in a sarcastic tone but my ego eats it's up. It's kind of nice for other people to notice I'm changing even though I'm not out yet. ~7mo hrt
The first day I decided I would go and use the women's restrooms at school . I was presenting for the first time, and didn‚Äôt pass at all. Earlier that day I had a somewhat negative experience in the same bathroom, and so when I went for the second time, and someone else was there, I was very nervous. The other girl looked at me, and said these words I'll remember all my life: your skirt is pretty.

It was the first time anyone had complimented me on an outfit I had wanted to wear. I could barely manage to respond ""thanks. You have a nice shirt""
Nonbinary and once went to a gendered bathroom in an airport. Was super nervous but only got a weird look out of the whole deal. Total dub for a teenager with anxiety üòé
At the start of my transition I went into the women's bathroom and got screamed at. Pretty wholesome considering I'm a trans guy lol.
I've literally been crying in a woman's bathroom by the mirror and had a cis friend stop and comfort me.
I‚Äôve been on T for over a year and a half now pass completely and I‚Äôm still nervous about using the bathroom, but It‚Äôs more from someone being a creep and asking why I‚Äôm sitting down to pee. I already have a few responses however. 1) the good old call their sexuality into question, eg: it‚Äôs kinda gay to be listening to guys piss 2) I really only use public toilets when I‚Äôm at work so just say it‚Äôs the only time I get to sit down outside work if you‚Äôre in general public you‚Äôve been walking around for a while and just want to sit down for two seconds or 3) botched circumcision
Well, I'm in the same situation as you, I feel as if I don't pass and I'm also not out at work nor do I wish to be.

Everyone or almost everyone seems to think I'm cis though. So, I go to a specific bathroom, it's the bathroom that only has one stall, basically you walk into the bathroom, and there's the door to the stall, usually everyone goes inside and closes it.
I've a coworker who, for some reason, enjoys peeing or doing whatever else with the door completely open, he does this while I'm washing my hands or brushing my teeth, he literally has no issue doing this right next to me, so that...kinda makes me feel more confident about passing. Weird situation, but I'm looking at it positively. 
However, I'm not comfortable going to public bathrooms because I don't wanna see penises (I'm unfortunately very repulsed by them), so, I only plan on going to those once I start T.  

Oh, and I also walked into the men's locker room one time at work, I was so fucking scared of seeing naked coworkers, but I had to give this one dude something he forgot at his work station. Thankfully the most NSFW thing I saw was an older colleague in his white underwear still getting dressed, very thankfully there were very few people there. And the coworker I was seeking started casually talking to me, which kinda made me feel better, but I was still a nervous wreck.
So my first day working a job where I can be totally out, our equivalent to a compliance officer walked in, said my dress was cute and asked how I was liking everything thus far. No one has batted an eye and the only thing I have to worry about is forgetting my purse and making sure my makeup is good. Hell, one of the old ladies misgendered me and later apologized after her next door neighbor (literally oldest dude there) pointed it out to her how messed up that was.

In general, I find most women are super supportive (going my direction anyway) and I have received more clothing and makeup than I actually use. If you have supportive dude friends, have them go with you. And I can agree with other comments that dudes genuinely do not give two darns about you being there most of the time.
omg I love that story üòç
OMG THATS SO SWEET
thank you for this story :) it's so relieving when people just accept you without asking questions or looking twice because why? we all pee, who cares where üôà
oh my gosh! this is amazing! making friends over a pad, i love it! üòç
Hey am a bit confused 
You said having needs urself u had pad 
Am a bit confused here why does treansfem need pads 
I am transfem myself and on 1 year hrt
That's wonderful! Honestly, I wish I had another person accompanying me but men going to the toilet in groups is very uncommon (at least that is the stereotype and those just love to feed fear) so I never dared to ask.
However I just made a couple of very wonderful cis male friends who I think would absolutely help me with this issue.
Honestly sometimes I feel more comfortable peeing in a bush because at least the bush is unisex xD
That is actually very encouraging.
I usually get pointed to the ladies room without asking for it and then I chicken out... to be honest, my city is very accepting and open and I probably could have tried a million times. But I never did.
Sometimes I think ""you're an adult, why are you this scared?""
I really am this scared. I am terrified xD
Thank you for this comment, it really helped.
I‚Äôm a trans guy pre-t and only out to friends. I use the womens bathroom which makes me really uncomfortable but using the mens is even scarier. I usually get weird looks but once on holiday in Cyprus I went in to the bathroom and a woman gasped so loudly at me then said ‚Äúoohhh‚Äù then left
I had had surgery to remove a large abscess from my taint. It drained profusely while healing. Using a pad had nothing to do with me being trans other than I wasnt embarrassed about it.
XD That is true!

Honestly I don't think anyone notices. He goes in to pee and usually by the time he washes his hands and dries them I'm done. The bathroom is either too small for many people to be in there worrying about us, or too big for anyone to notice a pair of people specifically.
For sure‚Äîyeah especially if you‚Äôre in an accepting type area you could give it a try for sure. If you‚Äôre still scared, you might try bringing a baseball cap/ ski beanie to wear or hoodie to put up. It helped me feel more like part of the usual crowd in a men‚Äôs room till I was more comfortable with it. Anyways, good luck!
Ah oki am sorry I got confused 
I hope you are doing fine now
I'm fine, thank you."	y5o0qy	trans	32	0.92	2022-10-16 18:28:17
Tennessee GOP leader threatens to raise taxes on companies that spoke out against anti-LGBT ‚Äòbathroom bill‚Äô		"I don't think you can legally raise taxes on a specific company. There may be a way to put forth a tax that hurts them more than others though (like if it was a bunch of furniture companies and you put forth a tax on furniture sales).
So, this officially proves we're in a modern day version of the 30s and 40s Russia and Germany. 

Discrimination laws worded to separate into a unique class, check. LGBT are the new Romani

Minority group mass hate, check. Muslims are the Jew. As a German-American, I feel sick.

The list goes on, and it's only a matter of time before work will bring us *fags* freedom, and God will be be with us, and our pink and blue triangles.

I keep hearing how this is unconstitutional, but I see no action being made to halt the passing if these asinine homages to the Gulags. 

I guess he wants to give people even less of a reason to visit Tennessee.

I swear, the southern states are having a race to see who can collapse the quickest. 
Seriously, I know it's a low-hanging fruit, but I feel like this is a great example of ""Do you not THINK before you speak?  How exactly do you plan to do that?""
Simple; You target these businesses with ""random"" regulatory inspections at a more frequent rate than others. Every business has some small infraction that can be fined to some degree.
As an Asian American I wholeheartedly agree. It's hard for people who were outside of an event to really resonate with correlations. It seems so silly to the average white American. Clearly we're not Nazi's, this is Murica. But from someone whose family was the correct squinty eye to stay out of ""internment"" camps I've seen the same writing on the wall for a long time. Most Americans fail to realize we were small steps away from doing the same thing we were condemning in WWII. And now all the same beginning steps and statements are being made.  
  
It's also why I'll never forfeit my guns. I won't go quietly into that sweet night. 
I know it doesn't seen like it now, but things are getting better. And at this rate, our grandkids are going to live in a utopia compared to us. It's counter intuitive but all these anti-trans laws are actually evidence of things improving. Ten years ago there were no laws because anti-trans parties didn't think they needed them. Society did a good enough job keeping us down that they didn't think they needed to get Johnny Law involved. But now that acceptance is growing they're desperate. These laws won't hold water. As soon as it gets taken before the supreme court they'll fall. But because of our legal system that takes time.

Imagine two people with cancer. One is getting treatment while the other is ignoring it. The one getting chemo will look and feel much worse but is getting better. Our society is getting chemo right now. It's hard, it sucks, but it will get better. We just have to be diligent and patient. In the meantime, keep working at it. Vote in EVERY election especially local ones.
Yes, but that isn't a tax.
> correct squinty eye to stay out of ""internment"" camps   

I think my spoons just spilled onto the floor. That's an awful thing to hear, especially with it being history. 

We really are, with these ""Religious Bills"" and the now blatant and open government corruption. We're slipping down a dark, deep hole. That will not end well this time. 
You just gave the inspiration I needed, to keep going. My life has, is very tough right now. However, this resonates with me. Thank you. :) 
True, but they may have to hire more attorneys due to the more frequent audits = more wasted $ and hours.
Maybe not technically, but practically and effectively it is.
Well if you remember the ""know your neighbor"" poster campaigns they racially profiled how to figure out the ""chinks from the Japs"" so that only the right ones were sent to suffer and lose their property.  
  
And unfortunately even in this day and age I'm reminded how separate I am from the ""average white person"" let alone now that I'm trans. It's seriously going to take some horrific times to get to ""equality"" even though it's 2016 and shouldn't be an issue.
I'm glad I could help. When things get you down, just try and remember that there is real good in this world and things are going to be better for us soon. We just need to be patient and diligent.
Oh, there are definitely ways to be really shady and attack these companies. But those ways aren't a legal tax.

I can't see facial hair in the mirror!!!	I walked past the bathroom mirror just after waking up and I felt good about how I looked without makeup. I look like a woman. I've waited so long for this.

I came out to my dad today	"This is a throwaway account, I had to post this because I've never felt so happy in my entire life and I needed to tell someone, whoever.

My psychologist (she's not a gender therapist, but thankfully, she supports trans and non-binary people) and I had planned a way to come out to my parents as trans, and we settled on having her explain it to only my dad, and on her own, as I couldn't bear the thought of doing it myself. 

Today, my dad had the appointment with her at 6, and my parents had to go to a family meeting right after. I waited after 6 until my dad came back, absolutely terrified of what he'd say to me. When I heard him coming up the stairs to my room I started shaking and immediately started browsing my computer to look busy. When he came into the room I had my back turned to him and I was browsing my computer, he approached me and said in a calm, serene voice ""[me], we have to talk after we come back from your uncle's."" I barely said ""ok"" and he put his hand on my shoulder and said very seriously ""But right now, I want you to know that, we will ALWAYS love you, no matter who you are."" I muttered out a shaky thank you and good bye as he left. 

As soon as they were gone, I broke down hard. I started to cry from happiness, so bad that I had to go to the bathroom to clean my face. I must have been there just sobbing and crying desperately for at least 15 minutes straight.

I'm sorry if this was long and boring, I'm just very emotional right now and feel like I dropped a huge weight off of me. I love my dad."	"This was not long and boring, congratulations!

OMG Accidentally walked into the men‚Äôs room at work (mtf 52)	I‚Äôve only been out at work for a couple weeks and when going To the bathroom I went on auto pilot and walked into the men‚Äôs room. Thank goodness it was empty but it was still embarrassing sneaking back out. Other than being embarrassing it was kind of affirming. It felt wrong immediately. I thought about just using the toilet quickly and sneaking out but then I glanced myself in the mirror saw my make up my dress and my long blonde wig. Nope I don‚Äôt belong in that bathroom anymore	"That's awesome! Internal validation is the best, tbh! Luckily my work has Gender neutral restrooms, but I've used the women's once and i felt like a perv.  There was no one in there and the men's was getting cleaned but still.
I did the same thing several times. When you are programed to turn left instead of right its  easy to do. Then it's all fuck me for a few seconds until you can get out of there.
that's fantastic! bathrooms are a site of terror for me still a little bit. I'm just a trans woman, but I'm early in my transition and I've been *alternating* which bathroom I use which, oof. I hope no one notices. When I'm dressed more femininely going into the men's room feels like such a mistake, but I'm still putting together a new wardrobe, so when I'm dressed in a more andro way I feel like I have to go to the men's room or risk like, some woman yelping.

Heya everyone, I just wanted to share something super positive that's happened to me today, hope that's okay!	"Late last year one of my friend's (guy #1) invited me to go to a gaming convention with him, and some of his other friends, and some of our mutual friends near the end of this year. I shrugged it off as a rather hollow invitation at the time (i'm not sure why) but still said yes, a long with lots of other people.

Last night it became a reality, and just like he'd told me stories of previous year's get togethers, lots of people backed out when push came to shove. From my perspective it was just going to be him, a mutual friend i met through him (guy #2), and myself going. Both of them know i'm trans, and both of them are super accepting and supportive, so I absolutely went for it.

Shortly after I found out that another guy, someone I don't know and have never spoken too before is going also (guy #3), that's fine, no biggie i'm sure he's great.

Guy #3 is talking to guy #2 (in dms) and asking questions about me, he asks what my name is, now guy #2 is so freaking precious  he panics and asks guy #1 (who i'm closer with) to ask me instead, because and I quote:

>i feel weird asking cause it feels like im dropping an ultimatum like im in any place to be doing that

I had been planning to hopefully go as myself the whole time I was there with them, and this extra guy shouldn't impact that plan really, so I just said to tell him my real name (not deadname) and if worst comes to worst it's a gender neutral name anyway, even though the last thing I want associated with me and that name is boymode, but, hey, whatever.

So after all the details are settled and bookings are made and stuff I go to bed with a big smile on my face, I don't really sleep that much and spend the whole night in my head planning outfits. (Lol)

Come morning my cat wakes me up for some breakfast, normally she wakes my mum up, but i guess i was restless enough to get all the attention this morning. After i'm properly awake and about to get up she climbs onto my bed and curls up next to me (something she literally never does, she's developed an aversion to cuddles for some reason) now i'm quietly squeeing into my pillow that the cat is curled up next to me.

When she finally get's sick of lying next to me (after a good 5 minutes, go kitty!) we get out of bed and I pull on some dirty shorts from h&m that i wore yesterday. Normally I wear my shorts around my hips in boymode and not around my waist, but this morning i just pulled them up to my waist without even thinking.

As I turn around to head out the door I stop dead and stare at the mirror, my room was still heaps dark so I was mostly just a silhouette in the mirror but since when have i had a narrow waist?! my shoulders are still way wider than my hips are, but with this new found narrow waist my body almost has some shape.

In the low light i couldn't make out any of my stupid body hair, and my bed-head was hanging loosely down in front of my shoulders, holy shit i actually liked what i saw in the mirror for the first time in... ever?

I head into the bathroom (more light) and put my hair up in a high ponytail, again, something i never normally do, and go feed the cat / make coffee.

I'm sitting here cross legged on the couch with my cat next to me, a big shit eating grin on my face, and tears in my eyes. Actually, genuinely happy. Best day of my life?

A teacher walks in. Gives me the WEIRDEST look, looks me up and down, and says hi, I walked out straight after and he asks my friend (who I was meeting) if he saw anyone. (He said no)

Teacher told my guidance counselor. I was TERRIFIED. Everything turned out okay tho, they told me I needed to pick one or another, which I'm not going to do but ya know

Have a nice day :)"	"You are a brave soul brother I envy you  ‚úä
 (I‚Äôm mtf out of school) I never ate brownies or anything else in the toilet so maybe he was worried more about that? :P
I wasn't IN the toilet I was just standing by the sink
I don‚Äôt recommend bringing food into the bathroom, let alone eating it.

Good on you for using the bathroom that matches your gender, but please don‚Äôt eat in there."	t3wl32	trans	32	0.93	2022-03-01 02:13:24
bathrooms	"just a question a

fellow transwomen when did u decide to use the bathroom of the gender you transitioned to as my journey is just fresh and i dont own any female clothing just yet well not much for public spaces i dont want to walk into the womens bathroom and be seen as a creep or get into fights ,,,"	"If you don‚Äòt present female in public yet, I wouldn‚Äòt go to the ladies‚Äò room if you want to avoid complications. There‚Äòs still the bathroom for disabled people if you‚Äòre not comfortable using the men‚Äòs room.
FYI: trans and woman are desperate words.  We aren‚Äôt transwomen we are trans women.  This distinction is important because transphobes make it a compound word in order to other us.  Trans is an adjective that modify the noun.  Transwoman is like saying prettywoman.

Anyway, with that lesson out of the way, I use the bathroom that matches my presentation.  Even now when I‚Äôm closer to passing though, I prefer single occupancy all gender bathrooms when possible.  I literally seek out restaurants and other places with all gender bathrooms and frequent those places.
The day I started presenting fem full time was the day I started using the female bathrooms. And in those early days I definitely didn't pass. Luckily never had any bad experiences
I started using the women‚Äôs restroom and locker rooms the moment I started passing (with a mask since it was in the middle of Covid). I present fully femme, ( clothing, hair, makeup, voice, mannerisms, etc. ). You‚Äôre much less likely to get clocked appearing full femme than going andro.
So, I'm a trans guy. Spent 2 and a half decades using the women's bathroom, and only this past year using the men's. The policing for women's bathrooms is far, far greater than the men's. If you don't present as feminine, it will likely lead to a rough time for you. I've had cases where I was followed/stared at/had people look at me and walk back out, even when I didn't know I was a trans guy, all because I had masculine clothes/hair/muscles. On the other hand, I haven't had an issue using the men's, because people either don't care, don't socialize there, or aren't on guard as much as women usually are. So I would wait until you can present in a feminine manner before using the women's public bathrooms. 

On the flip side though, there are some places where it might not matter as much. I know there are some LGBTQ+ bars and such that only have one bathroom, with stalls completely closed in and shared sinks. I also spent time in the marines, with communal bathrooms in the barracks. On weekends, it would be completely normal for men to use the women's, or women to use the men's shared bathroom. Only caveat would be to 'announce your presence' since there were showers there too. So if it's a smaller community where everyone somewhat knows each other, then it should be fine too. Think stuff like a niche shop where you know the staff because you are there a lot, or anything that involves shared interest, small numbers of people present, and where you know most people. That, or single-stall stuff like in gas stations. If it isn't busy and you want to try it out, that might be the place to try using the women's for the first time. If anyone does confront you when you come out, then you can always just play dumb (thought it was the men's), or say that the other one was occupied when you went in, or something like that. Best of luck!
In the mall that's near where I live, which is where I would spend most of my time in public before COVID, I'd use the single occupancy bathroom meant for disabled people and people changing baby diapers. I always felt bad, but I just felt so gross going into men's bathrooms even before I realized I was trans. Majority of men are fucking gross (the amount of time's I've had to hold it because someone pissed on the seat, and I was *not* going to wipe that up, or I've had to step over some ambiguous puddle...) and urinals are the most disgusting thing ever created.

Anyways, I'd recommend looking for places that have single occupancy and/or all gender bathrooms and frequenting those places.
I started using the womens washroom when i started getting in trouble for using the mens washroom. The last time i used the mens washroom a security gaurd asked me what i was doing in there and when i said i came in to ‚Äúuse it‚Äù, he had to listen to my voice closely and then said ‚Äúoh sorry you‚Äôre good‚Äù. Men would usually walk back out to double check the sign if they saw me inside.

Thats when i realize i don‚Äôt pass of as a guy anymore to use the mens. Used the womens from then on and never had issues.

The clothes i was wearing when i started transitioning is unisex clothing. Big shirts with cowl necks that show off my shoulder and some skinny jeans. So it can make you look very androgynous.

The only tip is to listen and watch our for reactions. You‚Äôll know when you‚Äôre ready to switch to the gender you transitioned to:)
I'm at the same situation. When I wear completely women's clothing,  I go to the women's bathroom. When not I'm using unisex-toilets or toilets for disabled people. When there aren't unisex-toilets or toilets for disabled people I'm not going to a toilet. That's rough but that's how I feel most comfortable.
I never level my home
Thank goodness for mask mandates. In the Seniors center where I volunteered for several years before transition, I use the ungendered washroom.

Started living full time June 2020, legal changes done by end of August 2020. As soon as I had my ID and gender markers changed, I waltzed my masked face in and did my business. I still mask in public, so no concerns.
Before I transitioned, I used the bathroom that best matched my presentation. If I was dressed in boy clothes, I used the mens room; when dressed as a girl, I used the ladies room. My goal was to be as unobtrusive as possible to avoid conflicts.
I live in a fairly progressive city and most of the time don't pay a lot of attention to which I'm entering. Sometimes I feel like I get weird looks in the men's, but they're often faster and I kinda stopped caring.

A ton of places I frequent have gender neutral bathrooms, so it feels like it's on the establishment if someone feels uncomfortable in a gendered bathroom, not me.
Yeah as soon as its obvious im transitioning id probably stop using the mens bathroom
I did not mean it in that way and you are 100% right just said it that way because cisgender‚Äôd people dont go trough the toilet problem sorry if i offended aomebody
Thats for me scary part i live in a city around 20k people so there is a lot of older traditions around my area who think like neanderthalers im scared for getting called out by people
Oh no, I‚Äôm not offended.  It‚Äôs one of the common mistakes people make when they first come out and I think it‚Äôs important that we learn these things so we use the correct terms when describing ourselves.

The bathroom thing is a bit of a nightmare right now since people have been making all kinds of awful claims about us. 

I basically boy moded for 6 months and used the men‚Äôs room because I still looked and dressed like a man.  Now I‚Äôm at 8 months and I‚Äôm full time and will use the women‚Äôs room.  I think I‚Äôm easily clockable but I don‚Äôt look like a man.  I look androgynous.  I look trans.  Some people may not clock me but I make the assumption that everyone does.
The first time I presented fem in public was on a relatively small island with a couple of small towns. I did get a few stares, but that was it. Now I obviously don't know your area well enough, but small towns can definitely be surface level accepting
Thank you for your personal experience i love to hear explanations like yours and others its really good advice also thank you for explaining it is really inportant and im never afraid to beter myself and see i made a misstake so once again thank you for explaining
Well my decision is once i pass ill dont think ill go into the male barhtoom again eventually you have to say to yourself let em stare if they notice
Of course sister!

Where I‚Äôm at, I‚Äôm allowed to use the bathroom that matches my gender identity but I still chose to use the men‚Äôs room.  I‚Äôve had other trans women tell me that you can use the women‚Äôs room but you should look like you ‚Äúbelong there‚Äù.  They meant girl moding.  While what they told me isn‚Äôt literally true, I did not want to be seen as a man in the women‚Äôs room by other women.  I didn‚Äôt want to even be seen as a cis crossdresser in there so I just boy moded and used the men‚Äôs despite my discomfort there as well.  It‚Äôs temporary though.

The craziest part for me is that I look in the mirror and see MAN.  Then I take a selfie and I don‚Äôt see the same person.  If I showed you a selfie I took a couple of days ago, you‚Äôd see but I don‚Äôt feel like I look like either gender.  It‚Äôs so weird."	wovg4k	trans	28	0.91	2022-08-15 09:47:04

what the fuck do I do?	"hey, trans ftm.
haven‚Äôt came out to anyone, don‚Äôt have any friends to come out to.
It was my birthday January 30th and I celebrated my birthday with my mom today.
(Parents are divorced)

my mom got me a massive fucking purse filled to the brim with feminine shit.
eyeliner, mascara, fake lashes, lipsticks, etc.

I just went to the bathroom after we were done celebrating and sat down and cried, I know I‚Äôm the one to blame cause I‚Äôve not came out and I‚Äôm too much of a coward to come out.

it fucking sucks cause my mom obviously really loves me and loves the fact I‚Äôm her ‚Äòdaughter‚Äô.

I don‚Äôt know what to do, she got me like 200$ worth of stuff and she opened them all so I ‚Äòwouldn‚Äôt have to struggle opening them‚Äô so I can‚Äôt return it and I don‚Äôt have the money to return it.

now I feel like I need to use the stuff cause her getting me all those items and me never using them seems like such a spoiled-kid move.

I didn‚Äôt ask for any one these items, and I fucking hate when people get me stuff I‚Äôve not asked for cause then it just ends up like this.

what the fuck do I do? I‚Äôm not wearing that shit and getting even more misgendered then I already am but I don‚Äôt wanna seem like a spoiled brat."	"See if there are local charities that would accept them. It's annoying that they're opened but if they're unused then maybe that's good enough. Especially, if you've got any local LGBTQ organizations, they could be a godsend for a transfem person and getting in touch with the organization would be a good start toward you building an accepting social circle.
be appreciative while your with her and then dont use them, donate them to a local charity if they‚Äôll take them, if they wont go to a local LGBT center and make a couple of transfem‚Äôs days. I get that it sucks, last Christmas i received some very masculine gifts, i thanked my family and smiled thru the hurt and as soon as i was home alone i went and sold the stuff. I know it can feel like you‚Äôre spoiled/unappreciative but thats just a mental block you‚Äôre going to have to get passed, dont be angry with your mother because im sure she had no ill intentions, be thankful for the chance you can help someone else now who‚Äôs actually going to use said makeup.
If you have any transfem friends or female friends in general I‚Äôm sure they‚Äôd love these tools. My moms also done the same, I‚Äôve simply put them in a box away, for when the time comes that somebody else would love them. It makes me still feel incredibly guilty though.. since mom bought them for me.
See if you can find charities to give them to and if you can‚Äôt, maybe keep them to give to future friends or other family members or throw them away. I suggest trying giving them away over throwing them out but that‚Äôs your choice
I will tell you what.... If you can promise me that you will listen to exactly what I have to say here, as this is the only time that I will ever do this, because I don't want to see other posts pop up like yours just to abuse this on reddit. I have read through your profile, and I can see the hard life that you are living. If you can get me a PayPal email address... I will send you the $200 as friends and family so no fees, and buy all of your makeup from you. Now obviously I know this world is crazy, and therefore I will not ask for your address, or my address to mail your makeup here to me... What I will ask you to do though, is to go to your nearest local LGBT community meeting place, and just Google one you'll find one I promise, and tell them your story, and that you are trans, and disperse your birthday gifts out there. They will greatly appreciate this, and tell them they were your birthday gifts. Mtfs need these things too, and sometimes something so small like this is just enough to save a life. I Absolutely know for a fact that you will feel 1000 times better, and absolutely no one will judge you. DM me if this is something that you would like me to do to help you. Please take care alwayz.üôÉ
I'd throw them out. What she did seems suspiciously purposeful and guilt trippy. Seems like she knows you don't like makeup and she's trying to coax you into using it...
Facebook market, the packaging might be open but the product themselves arent used. Second hand market might work for you
In her effort to show you love and support, it likely placed pressure on you too fast. Don‚Äôt rush beyond your comfort level. Your Mom will be understanding if she wants to give you space to manage feelings. I urge you to simply communicate so she knows and has the chance to continue her support of you and your decisions. It‚Äôs your journey and I am glad she‚Äôs affirming you. But her eagerness might be exceeding yours. You can put the items away or donate.
Well... I am sorry to hear this.... I hope that this will help you realize that there is nothing wrong with who you are, and that I am here with you... I actually have to go and get my wallet to type this out as it is on a steel plaque the size of my driver's license. I am mtf also, so you will get this instantly as my mom already knows that I am trans and still got this for me. Ok here we go.. the plaque reads "" I closed my eyes for but a moment and suddenly a man stood where a boy used to be. I may not carry you in my arms but I will always carry you in my heart. You have given me so many reasons to be proud of the man you have become, but the proudest is telling others that you are my son. Always & forever"". Now I also still realize that she means no harm by this as in she will still talk about female things with me etc way more than my own wife will actually. I am sure that you mom means you well also, and I believe that maybe if you still look kind of feminine, as I do masculine, than maybe that's why she still bought you makeup? I do wish you well though, and I am here to talk anytime if you need a friend, as I hate to see other people try to deal with these things alone. I am sure that obviously the feminine products will stop once you look more masculine if I am right about that atleast especially if she loves you like you say that she does. Please take care of yourself. I greatly greatly wish you an amazingly free life!üôÇ
Wanted to more than just upvote this.  Finding and befriending other trans people made everything vastly better for me.  Being able to just talk and be yourself and be affirmed while hearing how others are the same as you can bring a lot of peace.
any ideas how I can find them? I tried searching for lgbtq charities but couldn‚Äôt seem to find any near me,, what do I search?
 ^^ This. 

I really think this sub should organize a gift swap during the holidays. You‚Äôre a trans girl that got a bunch of masculine clothes and/or cologne? Cool sign up to swap them with a tran man who got a bunch of makeup and feminine clothes. 

Hell forget the holidays. Let‚Äôs just start something like r/transswapmeet.  

(And before anyone says anything, I‚ÄômADHD af and don‚Äôt have the brain to actually organize something like this, but y‚Äôall can have the idea for free)
Oh, and most importantly.... Happy Birthday!
Get what you‚Äôre saying, but throwing them out when there are folks who could actually use them seems really wasteful.
Wow... I am sorry... I actually thought that she knew that you were trans, but I reread your post.... I am in no position to tell you exactly what to do, but in my own personal experience... I waited until I was 34 to tell anyone, and it made me absolutely miserable like I was in hell. I just advise you to maybe come out to her. I think that honestly %99 of the time it will go perfectly fine. Ask yourself this... What is your plan for never telling anyone or waiting for the right moment. My opinion is that this is the time to tell someone in your life, and free yourself. Things do get better once you start opening up and not trying to hide like I have. I have wasted so much of my life in severe depression as you are doing this exact thing to yourself right now by the sounds of your post. No one can help you but you in the end. I do promise you that if you tell someone no matter what they say.. that weight will be lifted from you. It is your choice obviously, I just hope that you can be free of this. Please take care and still read the above as again my mom did still get me that after knowing, but I myself take no offense to it because if you are a normal human being... Change is very hard. Stay safe! :)
Hmm. You could try ""lgbt center"" or ""group"" or ""organization"". You could probably even use google maps or something and just search ""lgbt"" near you. Searching Facebook is also potentially fruitful.

Alternatively, did you have any kind of Pride event in the area last year? If you could find info on that, it would probably lead you to the organizers. A local college might have an lgbtq student union that could either get stuff to people or tell you about other orgs. If you can't find anything, there's always charities and shelters for women.
thank you! your comment really helped <3

What Restroom to use MTF	"I am 14 and pre everything. I, however, am considered passable and when using the men's restroom many people feel uncomfortable and confused. I've been told that I'm in the wrong restroom or asked if they were in the wrong restroom. I need advice on what restroom to use now or to continue using the male bathroom with all these troubles I've been giving people! 
 
-love, Olivia"	"use whichever you're most comfortable with. it really doesn't matter as long as you're doing what everyone else should be doing: treating the shared public place with respect. your mere existence bothering people is nobody's problem but their own, you're not hurting anyone just by being there.
I don‚Äôt pass and I use the restroom I‚Äôm dressed for. I was in the mall today and used the woman‚Äôs and there are about 10 other people in there and no one bothered or looked. Be aware of any laws in your area though
I tried to avoid women‚Äôs restrooms until I had legal name and gender changes, which were neither expensive nor difficult in my province. This only took a couple of months after I started HRT and living full time as myself. However, the situation is probably different for a seventy year old mtf.

I don‚Äôt know what the legal situation is in your jurisdiction. It may be wise to check. As a minor, you may be exempt. I tried to find ungendered restrooms until I got my paperwork. 

If you can get some kin of ‚Äúofficial status‚Äù you may be safer. If you have a counsellor you trust, discuss this with them, and, if you find using one or the other restroom alleviates dysphoria, share that information with a safe authority who can maintain confidentiality. That way, if there are problems, you may have supportive people with some qualifications in your corner. 

I wish I could just say that you should do whatever feels best. Unfortunately there are too many people who will be ready to do you harm if you don‚Äôt conform to their beliefs and opinions.

I wish you well as you learn who you are and how you can be yourself.
Use the one that aligns with your presentation and will be the least awkward imo.  The point is that you‚Äôre using the bathroom that aligns with your gender, not what aligns with your hormones or clothes.  Some of us need HRT and different clothing choices to pass or make our identity clear, some people don‚Äôt, but at the end of the day it‚Äôs a public restroom and you don‚Äôt want to have any awkward encounters.
Sometimes there's also gender inclusive restrooms, if you don't feel comfortable in neither women's or men's bathrooms that could be an option, the only problem is that not every place has one
Use what fits with your presentation, and with an eye for safety, be aware of anything that'll be a major clocking risk like facial hair. If you're at least mostly passable you can use the one you're comfortable with. When you can update your ID you'll at least have a safety net if you're clocked, can show a staff the ""F"" on Sex for your ID.

I don't know how feminine your voice sounds so just be careful with that, try not to talk (it happens sometimes but where I'm from not often). Also... Sit back on the toilet and point your bits backwards so when you pee it splashes. People with vaginas make audible sound and it'll help you sound like everyone else.

If you present femme enough people won't really bat an eyelash. And in case you think you might not... In my experience cis people are honestly really clueless. For all the boasts from the ""we can always tell"" crowd... No, they really can't. I've literally had visible hair I was growing for electrolysis and not been clocked. But your mileage may vary on that.

I do wish it was as simple as ""you're a woman use the women's and fuck everybody else"" but I hesitate to say that to a younger person. Tbh the bathroom really isn't as big a deal as some people make it out to be, but it depends on the density of people in your area who'd make it a big deal and I want to err on the side of caution.
Use the bathroom that matches how you are currently presenting.
Idk, I'd say if you're sure you pass, use the women's, but be very very careful, all it takes is one maga crackpot to ruin your day. Just be careful.
Being non binary I'll do a quick evaluation if I'm presenting more fem or masc that day and use the matching one. But I do love places that have the single use (family) bathroom since I don't have to worry about other people
i never really pass fully (i have a bigger chest so even binding doesn‚Äôt hide it) and i‚Äôm genuinely scared of getting assaulted so i always use the women‚Äôs, even though it makes me dysphoric. the single use bathrooms are a *life saver* but i always feel bad for using them like i‚Äôm taking them from a family who actually needs it üò≠ 

i usually just try to not use the bathroom in public unless i really need to
i personally avoid public bathrooms altogether because god damn they are *nasty*
You need to use the bathroom. If the family needs the bathroom they can wait 3 minutes for you to pee. Don‚Äôt feel bad in the slightest using them.
That is a fair point :) some are better than others, but only if the building is pretty new or it was recently renovated. Gas station bathrooms suck"	xaf3z7	trans	33	0.87	2022-09-10 03:43:53

I‚Äôm just worried cause we have restaurant reservations and I fear talking exc. and I fear going to stores and opening my mouth. I also am worried taking the train. Oh and bathrooms. A lot of things. This is my first time out as my true self so I‚Äôm just worried is all.	"NYC people are so focused on themselves, they will not even pay any attention to you. Unless you have something to sell to them. Trust me.
I live in NYC! I have anxiety about going out too but honestly nobody has ever said anything to me. Just wear headphones and people will leave you alone to be yourself.
No one will care at all in NYC. Honestly, everyone in NYC has learned to mind their own business. Just go and be your gorgeous self.

You likely won‚Äôt be bothered!! Most of us are just more concerned with getting around and doing our day to day. I will say though on the off chance you do encounter someone on the street who is being verbally aggressive the best thing to do is not engage and just leave the area as quickly as possible. That hardly ever is needed but on the off chance that comes up then that‚Äôs the best standard procedure for going about it!

A coming out letter to my mum (need opinions)	"I am your daughter.  I always have been but I was the daughter who was told she was a man, expected to participate in men‚Äôs activities, expected to act like a man, dress like a man, groom herself like a man.  

Who looked into the mirror every day and knew she was ugly, who looked at her mum and then her sisters and wanted nothing more then to be just as beautiful even just a little üòî

When she went into school and had to use male bathrooms she felt embarrassed and scared she felt naked like everyone could see who she really was, locker rooms became a source of anxiety and distress, she never felt she could be herself, she felt scared and upset and all she wanted to do was run away.

The daughter that could never be herself who thought she was an embarrassment so did just what was expected of her and went back into hiding.

The daughter who woke up every morning feeling like her body was missing bits that this thing she was in wasn‚Äôt hers and then was forced through one transition when her body tried to reinforce the idea she was a man by making her have testosterone, but even after that she still knew it wasn‚Äôt right.

The daughter who met people who she saw a future with who had crushes she thought she wasn‚Äôt allowed to have, to have dreams of relationships with people who never really saw her who she couldn‚Äôt even touch for fear of being called gay or a freak.

The one person I should of trusted was you; but I was the most terrified of losing you, I thought I would have no one that I would be truly alone and because of that I never gave you a chance I am truly sorry for that maybe it could of been different for us both.

All my life I‚Äôve been in distress unable to vocalise how I felt because of shame, embarrassment my own transphobia because of films like ace Ventura I thought how I felt was something to be ashamed off a ‚Äúfake‚Äù girl trying to ‚Äútrick‚Äù cis people and it took me a very long time to get over that. Actively trying to deny who I am by using my self critic to reinforce every negative thing I ever heard about myself or trans people.

All I want to do now is be the girl I was always meant to be, as beautiful on the outside as I am on the inside. To live a life I‚Äôm proud of,  to be unashamed of being myself.

I am your daughter, my name is Lily Anne and I love you so very much."	"[deleted]
I love the name Lily Anne! You‚Äôre so brave and I hope everything goes well as you come out to your mother!
Awww precious Adorabean that‚Äôs soooooo sweeeeet! Proud of you no matter what!
I believe in you ‚ù§Ô∏è. You can do this. I am sure that your mom will love you for who you really are. It takes a lot of courage to come out. I can tell that was wrote from the heart and I am sure your mom can tell too. Good luck ‚ù§Ô∏è
Quick update
I gave it her and she messaged me back later saying she was super proud of me, thanks for helping me kind strangers
I think its beautiful, though in some points it sounded like it could have been a suicide note.  I'm not sure how to fix that, but maybe be aware of that in your presentation, or add some sort of preface? Maybe in the first paragraph add something about how you are finally taking steps to fight back or live comfortably or something implying that you have a future?
I do have an intro but it was kind of personal and had some information I didn‚Äôt want to share but this is the main body.

I‚Äôll definitely sort out the punctuation before I give it her.

Thanks for the feedback!
Thank you very much ‚ù§Ô∏è
I can definitely see where your coming from and I do have a short intro but also I‚Äôm really trying to put into words my feelings and that‚Äôs not easy to do and to show the joy that this journey will bring me I feel I have to show the pain of how I got here in the first place to show her this is who I am, not a choice I‚Äôm making.

Hope this made sense ‚ù§Ô∏è

Edit: oops meant this as a reply to the person who said it had a Suicide note vibe, definitely don‚Äôt want to hurt myself I want to live now more then ever üíï"	l8nhwj	trans	29	0.98	2021-01-30 15:04:31
men's bathroom tips ?	"yes yes, i know it sounds silly but i am serious. i've never had to use a men's bathroom before because at work the bathroom is gender neutral, but i'm going on a trip in a month and will be needing the men's room in a very busy place. 

what do i do in there to make sure i don't break any unspoken bathroom rules ? do cis guys ever pee sitting ? save me."	"Yeah, cis guys will occasionally pee sitting. Usually it's because they need to shit as well- but if you let out some farts at the same time that will satisfy the curious. And if you don't- that's fine too. Cis dudes are usually some of the most oblivious beings on this planet. Act like you own the place and they won't even give you a second glance. Also- if there are any ""rules"" plenty of cis guys will break them without a second thought so go nuts. 

When I was still a mtf egg, I often sat down to pee in the men's restroom even when i didn't need to and didn't know why that felt more comfortable (still cis right) and nobody noticed or cared. So I have firsthand knowledge on this. ‚úåÔ∏è
Unfortunate but necessary warning ‚Äî in mens‚Äô public bathrooms seats are often wet. Look before you sit
it is intimidating the first few times, but once you build that confidence up and feel like you‚Äôre in the right spot, using the men‚Äôs restroom is just a speck in the scheme of life. you‚Äôre only in there for a few minutes, don‚Äôt sweat it!
No one bothers someone in a stalls. If you're waiting for a stalls and a urinal is free then just act like you ate too much or are gassy.

If you use a urinal (there are funnels and other things that can let you do that I've heard) then picking the farthest one against the wall is usually good, next best is a 1 urinal gap away from anyone else, but don't sweat it if it's more crowded than that. Very rarely are guys going to say anything or have wandering eyes. Maybe about 5% of the time you'll get someone trying to start a conversation at the urinals (usually when sports are involved), but short, concise answers will take care of them without issue.

Last note, guys don't often wash their hands after using a urinal but really should. You'll see that but no one will bat an eye if you do.
Eyes front, always. It isn't a social club. Most fellas get in and get out quickly and will never even look in your direction.
Okay, so, let's talk about The Gap. When possible, you leave a gap between yourself and the next person. Lets say there's five urinals; if someone is at spot 2, you go to spot 4. If they're at spot 3, you go to 1 or 5. If another person in there acknowledges you, grunting and upnodding is acceptable, but do not, I repeat, do not make eye contact. If that happens, you are bound by social contract to sword fight. Despite all my years of using the men's room, I don't know what happens if you down nod and grunt. I'm too scared to find out and plan on leaving the men's room for good soon.
Go in, do your business, don‚Äôt talk, and don‚Äôt make eye contact. This is the way‚Ä¶or was for me once‚Ä¶LOL
Hello ! Transguy here üëã
Don't be afraid to go the men's bathroom. Usually nobody cares. I don't have SRS or packing, and no man ever ask me why I don't use the ""stand to pee toilet"" (sorry, english is not my native language üòÖ). I suppose they just assume I'm shy or I need to poo... ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
I think the only real, though unspoken rule is no talking
Most of the rules are around urinals.  If you go into a stall, you‚Äôll be fine as long as you‚Äôre just minding your own business and avoiding unnecessary eye contact.
be prepared of how disgusting they are. I don't miss them
You can allways go sitting while pee.Who actually knows which one you go there for? Number 1 or number 2. Guys assume that if the toilet door is closed theres someone just taking dump. Dont stress about it. Guys dont have any toilet culture actually. They dont even bother wash hands.
Also loud farts seems to be the thing in mens toilet while peeingü§≠
1) rule of the mens room is MIND YOUR BUSINESS! Eye contact is not encouraged, and the only time men speak to each other in there is if they 1) are drunk, 2) already know eachother, 3) something eventful has happened like the lights went out. Its perfect for us bc all men want to get in and out of there with no interaction. I have a theory that cishet men are just as scared of getting hatecrimed for being percieved as being gay as they are of a potential predatory queer in the bathroom, so the act of them confronting you is risky for them because talking to random men in the mens room is Against The Man Law. Theres a whole etiquette  around the urinals and its a real hot zone for keeping your head down and not conversating. So all of this really benefits us bc we can slip in and out like everyone else.

2) Guys do pee when sitting, usually when theyre shitting, but see #1. Its a joke that wimpy/gay men pee while sitting so tbh sometimes i just let it loose and assume theyll make fun of me in their head but rule #1 is so essential to most men that no one has said anything to me, even coworkers. Although most toilets have a trick where if you hold down the flusher it will make a continuous flush and you can pee without being heard and they can assume the toilet is malfunctioning if theyre even paying that much attention (but theyre probably on their phone). 

3) If you walk in and all the stalls are occupied just leave. It freaks a lot of trans guys out and they think that will out them, but over the years ive walked in with men and we both saw the stalls were occupied so we left. Men go to the bathroom to shit too!
What I do is walk straight to the sitting thing( I don't know the word) and don't look up or something
never stand next to someone at the stand up toilets
If you are not useing a STP thingie it's easy. Act like you don't give AF and don't talk.

If you are useing a STP thingie always keep a gap in between. It's a science of itself to find the right urinal to use but as a rule of thumb keep away from others as far as possible will do the trick.
Kind of depends on whether you have to pee or poop, and if pee, whether you use an STP device.

For times when you need a stall, I don't think there's all that much protocol, really. Just look for one where the door is open, and make your way decisively there.

With the urinals, though, there is definitely some protocol.

1. Wherever possible, leave an empty urinal between you and your fellow pee-ers
2. Don't spend a long time thinking about which urinal to use. Don't stand there and dither about it awkwardly. It's a snap-decision kind of thing. Just pick one and march decisively to it.
3. Keep your head facing forward (or downward, as necessary) while you do your business, but don't be looking to the side. This is not a time for chit-chat, making new friends or eye contact.
Some cis men do pee sitting down. My bf is cis and when I asked a similar question he told me everyone really just minds their business. Men‚Äôs bathroom etiquette is just to use the bathroom and keep your eyes to yourself! He added that the only time people really take note of each other is if someone is taking a particularly loud shit.
Huge thing that I haven‚Äôt seen people mention, plenty of men are shy pee-ers and can‚Äôt pee in front of people. If some person asks (which is pretty much never) feel free to say you are a shy pee-er and nobody will bat an eye!
Just get in and pee and leave. Nobody cares what you are doing at all. Just don't talk to anyone because that's weird.
Get a shewee. I know it sounds stupid, but it makes it so you can pee standing up. Maintain a 1 urinal distance unless it is really crowded. If you want to really get wild make and maintain eye contact with the people around you to establish dominance(just kidding on that last one), but seriously, go in there do your thing and get out. Nobody will care.
Biggest rule is to basically never talk, think of it like an animal, they wont disturb you of you don‚Äôt disturb them
Frankly when it comes to the men's room, Walk in like you own the place, don't make eye contact, and don't talk to anyone. No one will pay any attention if you go into a stall, nor if you sit down. Guys just 100% mind their own business in there. If anyone tries to say anything just look at them like they're an idiot, they will certainly back down, and if they don't,  tell them to mind their own damn business.
thank you ! it's comforting that i've heard the comment about obliviousness multiple times lmaoO 
your experience and expertise is much appreciated :D
No need to perform with farts and stuff in the washroom. Literally nobody is listening to make sure the person in the next stall is taking a dump. Just go in there, pee, wash your hands and leave. Not a single person will care. 

If it makes you feel better to fart to throw off the scent, pun not intended, then go ahead. But yeah, nobody is paying attention to anyone else in the washroom.
i never hit the seat blind, i'm fully prepared already
This this this this this this this.
This. And try not to touch anything at all, ever. And it's preferable to wear waterproof shoes as well.

Some men see going to the toilet as a kind of competition to make the loudest, most disgusting noises possible. You're in for a treat üòÅ
hopefully i can go swaggerin on out of there soon
thank you kindly, this is like excellent military toilet prep
banking on fellas not trying to make convo. too many times i go for a piss and a girl wants to talk somehow
i can't make eye contact when required, so hopefully we make it out unscathed... unsheathed... 
i will report back if i ever nod down and live to talk about it
I don‚Äôt leave a gap, if there‚Äôs five urinals open in one person peeing i pee right next to that person to assert dominance XD 


Don‚Äôt actually do this lol
lips are sealed and eyes are averted. have wonderful times on the other side of the stalls, my friend
My boss used to talk to me if we were in there at the same time, it was super weird.  Yay WFH now.
thank you so much !! this was so comprehensive and reassuring hahaha
in and out like a mission ü´°
note to self: shit averagely loud
this is good to know haha, perfect excuse !
being able to pee standing up would be epic. hopefully they make them that look realistic enough to not look like i'm about to start siphoning gas !
Make sure you wipe the seat first‚Ä¶they still don‚Äôt lift the seats and they just piss all over everything.
haha, this one made me laugh, thank you :D
Don't swagger. You'll draw attention and you're not John Wayne. Big egos get noticed and get conversations started. Just act like you don't give AF or your wife is nagging you with texts on your phone ;)
Guys try to pretend like that nobody else exists in there. No eye contact, no conversation, nothing.
If you really want to assert dominance, wait for the person to finish in the urinal despite every other one being open ü§£ü§£
just a standard, impromptu work performance assessment
üëÜ
This. üíú

This is an important point I forgot. 

And in some restrooms you may want to use the paper seat covers they provide for extra safety.
bahaha absolutely no swagger, got it. i don't think i could muster a proper Big Man ego if i tried lol
I think you'll develop a legit swagger, in the right venue, and I'll be cheering you on. Men's restrooms have always been a personal hell for me since I was super young. I live in a right wing small town and I present as genderfluid in public. As such, to be an annoying b\*tch, I still use the men's room even though my tits are almost a C cup and I'm usually wearing pink, purple, glitter of some sort and super feminine fragrances. Men don't expect to smell YSL Mon Paris in their latrine. It's hilarious, but they're the ones that made up all the stupid bathroom gender rules ;)"	1203457	trans	32	0.9	2023-03-24 00:27:50
I'm scared my partner is going to leave me because I am trans	"I started back up on Testosterone recently. I stopped a few years back due to some issues.
I ended up pregnant during that time and had a baby with my husband. 
Now that I started up again, idk why but I feel scared my partner won't like me anymore.
My husband is pan and leans more toward guys to begin with. I have passed as a guy since we met and he knows I am trans. He's the most supportive person I have met. In fact he sends me trans related tiktoks to me and when I had to do my first shot after getting back on T he sat in the bathroom with me. He talked and asked questions that I happily answered.
There isn't anything to suggest he won't like me anymore.
He saw pictures of me a few years back when I was on it and was very masculine. I know when we first started dating and stuff I dressed feminine.  In fact I kind of put myself back in the closet. I ruined my own wedding by forcing myself to wear a dress. I know it's internal and living in a small religious town.

Idk I am struggling. I don't want to tell him I'm worried about this because it's a common fear that he will leave me. I also don't want to come off as annoying for constantly asking for reassurance."	"I think clear and open communication is always the best route, you don‚Äôt want any negative things to linger and grow. It‚Äôs just gotta be respectful and come from a place of care, for both sides
There's a child also involved now, that's from both of you? Open lines of communication please. You owe it to yourselves and your child
It‚Äôs important to talk through things like this. Let him know how you‚Äôre feeling and figure out together what it will take for you to feel secure. Who cares if it‚Äôs a common fear? Relationships are built on communication and they suffer when you let issues (trans related or not) build up in your own head. Good luck!
Do you have access to therapy? It seems like your husband has shown nothing but support thus far and from what you are saying there are no red flags to suggest that he will suddenly withdraw his support.

Sounds like you may need to work through these fears and anxieties (do you also struggle with low self confidence/worth?) with a professional. 

Your husband has told you and shown you who he is. It sounds like you're very lucky in that regard. Hopefully with help you can believe him.
Yes he's both of ours
Thank you
I just feel like I talk about it a lot and that he will start to think I doubt him or don't believe him.
I sadly don't. My previous therapist doesn't take my insurance and I am still stuck on my dad's. 
We have been talking about trying to get me in.
I do struggle with low self worth and confidence. A lot of it has to do with my childhood. 
Part of it has to do with people seamlessly hitting on him. Especially after he told them he wasn't interested and is married. It's just a fear of mine that he will replace me when a better person comes along
I mean, can you express that feeling to him? ie that you‚Äôre worried about bringing it up all the time. It may put your mind to rest to hear how he feels about that.
Yeah 
I know it's mostly a me thing. Because of previous long term relationship the person didn't let me express that and often made me feel this way. 
I'm trying to get into therapy for it"	z9od4x	trans	31	0.9	2022-12-01 13:50:08
Gym locker rooms are terrifying!!! üò¨üò©	"I thought bathrooms used to be scary (and sometimes they still are depending on the day) but I was not prepared for how terrifying the locker rooms at the gym would be.

I (non-binary woman) just joined planet fitness and went for the first time today. I‚Äôve been to gyms before but not since I transitioned. Needless to say I was feeling anxious. I checked planet fitnesses policy before joining which states ‚Äúall members, including transgender members, may use Planet Fitness locker room facilities and programs based on their self-reported gender identity‚Äù. So I knew I had the rules to protect me but I didnt know if they would be enforced correctly or if another guest would complain without knowing the policy. 

When I checked in the guy at the front desk was very nice right off the bat. He pointed out where the women‚Äôs locker room was without me even saying anything (I intensionally dressed as fem as possible - shorts and a racerback tank top w my bra strap showing). It was only the second time I‚Äôve had an interaction w someone I didn‚Äôt know where it was apparent they actually read me as female, so I was kind of taken off guard and didn‚Äôt say anything in response. I just started working out. 

Just being in the gym, which was moderately crowded, wasn‚Äôt so bad. Mostly people seemed to be minding their own business. I got on a bike and road for a few minutes while I looked around and tried to get a sense of the vibe. It seemed pretty chill so I started using some of the machines. The few people I had small interactions w didn‚Äôt seem to notice or mind my presence in any particular way. I did notice one woman staring at me for a few seconds when I was on a machine but it could have been totally innocent. 

Before I left I decided to go into the women‚Äôs locker room just to use the bathroom and prove to myself that it would be okay. I walked by a couple women at their lockers. I didn‚Äôt try to acknowledge them. My approach was to just act like I belong there so no one might think I didn‚Äôt.  There was another woman washing her hands next to me and I didn‚Äôt look up. When I was exiting I passed by a woman who was momentarily surprised by my presence, but I‚Äôm very tall so that‚Äôs kind of unavoidable. 

I still don‚Äôt really feel safe but I feel wayyy more safe than trying to use the men‚Äôs locker room. I could easily wear masc clothes and walk in and no one would blink an eye but I wouldn‚Äôt be at all comfortable there. 

On my way out of the gym I stopped to talk to the same guy who had checked me in to ask if they had any gender neutral accommodations. I had intended to ask when I first arrived but was thrown off by being properly gendered so I balked. When I did finally ask he said he understood why it was important and I wasn‚Äôt the only one who had asked, but unfortunately they didn‚Äôt have any. He said he would ask his manager to see if there were any upcoming plans to roll out gender neutral locker rooms. Keeping my fingers crossed but not getting my hopes up. 

Anyway, it‚Äôs just frustrating that something as simple as going to the gym can be so complicated and scary. Any advice on how to be more comfortable there in the future?"	"I feel similarly but find while I dress masc and am trans-masc non-binary, it‚Äôs safer for me to use the women‚Äôs locker room. I get stares every time but would be in more danger using the men‚Äôs. I‚Äôd prefer it if there were no gender and you could just go in, use private stalls, and everyone share the space equally. My way of dealing with it is to just accept that I don‚Äôt go there to be comfortable. I go to work my body and clean off my sweat and leave. You did exactly what I do: acknowledge no one, go directly point A to B to A, be fast and efficient. Sadly, non-binary people just don‚Äôt have the luxury of widespread gender inclusive spaces yet :(
That's amazing your gym responded that way about the bathrooms! Honestly my only advice is to continue showing up and taking up space. Maybe making friends there to workout or showing up with a fem friend to go with you would help? Otherwise.  . . Know your limits? Don't go when your dysphoria is real bad, especially cause gyms tend to have a lot of mirrors, but that's just in my experience.
Thank you for sharing this ‚ù§Ô∏è Locker rooms still scare the shit out of me so this was mildly reassuring to read"	103iaip	trans	27	0.88	2023-01-04 23:11:13
