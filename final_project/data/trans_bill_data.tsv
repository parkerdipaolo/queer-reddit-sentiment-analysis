They want us gone		"They want to ban college bathrooms? Will I have to go off campus to take a dump? /s

What the actual fuck are these bills? It literally doesn‚Äôt affect anything to have unisex toilets and HRT should be a discussion between patient and provider, not lawmakers and lobbyists‚Ä¶

[One bill which will be heard today is a ban targeted at litterboxes in schools. Something that does not exist and something that was a hoax by Libs of TikTok.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617895876235759621?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)



I literally cannot believe the people who MAKE our laws still believe that litterbox bullshit. They spent a huge amount of effort making that bill. Think about all the other shit they legislate on.



[He claims when trans people compete in sports, they nearly always win. and he's like... really wrong? Most trans people do not come close to winning titles, championships, etc.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617904662774157312?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)

[We've had trans people competing for decades and it's fairly rare that they dominate sports.](https://twitter.com/erininthemorn/status/1617904662774157312?s=46&t=ZzUTdNC2K--Yqftju2MbyQ)
I don't know what to do.   I know I need to stay informed, but every time this happens its retraumatizing.   I just want to be able to live and be happy.
So fucking much for ""a free country"" when we can't even have basic rights. God, I hate America so much.
We live in an actual NIGHTMARE
self care isn't enough i need transphobic politicians to suffer
Transitioning saved my life in a way no mood stabilizers ever did. I can't be alone.

If I had to detransition I would likely be dead in a week, self inflicted but a victim of someone else's hands.

I'm against the government pushing medical bills. Against them forcing in either direction any sort of treatment. Not giving or taking. The government and their medical corporation overlords need to stay out of peoples lives.

If someone wants to ferment skunk secretions mixed with essence of cow dung and a drop of cerebral spinal fluid of a monk fish, go on then for all I care since either none of my business.

Throwing out people's rights and in some cases lives for their religious political ideologies that obviously don't fit those they're imposing . . . um.

Um??

""The First Amendment prohibits the Congress from making a law ""respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof"". This provision was later expanded to state and local governments, through the incorporation of the First Amendment.""

Does this not work both ways? The constant argument is always centered around religion.

This works for all religions, right? 

 But what about those whose existences are seen as abominable for certain religions?

It's a witch hunt. When did that start being acceptable again?

The amendments mean nothing if they only protect some and of those protected people use their protections against minority groups. This is such a stereotype of America -_-
‚ÄòLand of the free‚Äô my ass
""NOOO TRANS GENOCIDE ISNT REAL WDYM VICTIM COMPLEX REEEEEEEE""

/s
I hate this country so much
I‚Äôve legit had people on Reddit tell me the phrase ‚Äútrans rights‚Äù bothers them because we supposedly already have rights. With politicians imposing bills like these all over the country, that is demonstrably false. Fuck this.
Well, I was thinking about HRT, but Florida isn't looking much better for this shit. Fuck me.
I live in north dakota, I am fucking terrified rn.
They should ban unisex bathrooms and then we can all storm their houses and put them under citizen‚Äôs arrest for having unisex bathrooms

Either way I highly suggest trans people in North Dakota take advantage of their lax firearm ownership laws üëÄ
The US is a joke country
So I travel through ND regularly and I often stop at gas stations and restaurants that have single stall all gender washrooms. Will those be illegal under these new laws?
They want to ban gender neutral washrooms?
Religion is to blame.  Trans people make Religious people question their faith, and they don't like it.
I feel for my trans friends in the USA. It‚Äôs unreal that a country commends itself on freedoms, well isn‚Äôt this a violation of the constitutional right to freedom. It‚Äôs hard to wrap my head around. I‚Äôm glad I‚Äôm in Canada. Love you all‚Ä¶
God I need to leave this fucking country
i seriously want out of this fuckin country
my two-ton gas-hogging hellbeast is itching to turn transphobes into roadkill, i just might let her have what she wants üòè
People living in that state need to get involved in local politics.
Young people and mostly lgbtq people ‚Äúdon‚Äôt like‚Äù politics but is literally the reason why the country became a medieval holy kingdom.
Local politics are way more important than what most people assume.
What excuse can they *possibly* have to ban a bathroom that has ONE toilet inside it????
Are we all just gonna ignore CONVERSION THERAPY
Something is gonna break. Even my co-wokers who don't care about trans people are beginning to raise their eyebrows at this stuff.
Yeah. The GOP wants us exterminated like roaches, and they'll stop at nothing to get it. I have to imagine we'll eventually get to a point where they'll actually try, as much as I hate to say it. People always tell me ""it's 2023, nobody cares, get over yourself"" when shit like this is happening. I confronted a friend the other day about making anti-trans jokes, because he made a joke that implied I had no rights, and I told him that it hurt me because in some states, I don't have rights. His response? ""You don't live in those states, so it's not a problem"" and ""just don't go to those states then"". After a little bit of back and forth, he said ""it's 2023, nobody gives a shit"". It's people with that mentality that are going to get us killed. If they keep dismissing it and pretending like it doesn't exist, then that's just giving the GOP more power and freedom to do what they wish with us since they don't have as much clap back as they should.
And these are the same people who'll say ""Love thy neighbor"" It doesn't seem like they are loving thy neighbor
This... This right here is why I want to head to the demon realm! It's plenty better than planet earth at this point
We need to stand up against those tyrants, if we won't, we will eventually even lose our freedom to live.
What sort of dystopian bs is this? People really do spend their time, effort, and money in literally the worst way when it comes to trans rights. They could use this money to improve so many things, not just in the realm of trans rights, but other issues, and yet their bigotry and hate leads them to use it like this? Wtf is wrong with people, I've never been more glad to not live in the US
We are elemental. We are a force of nature. We will grow back forever when their buildings are rubble. Deprive us of even the most basic resources and we will still self-actualize. And we will never not fight them united.
This is so sad. :(
Fuck North Dakota
This is horribly misspelled. It is clearly supposed to say ‚ÄúIn just 20 minutes, North Dakota will debate declaring war on trans people. I will be here livetweeting‚Äù
Get your passports‚Ä¶
Conversion therapy is literal torture. How the fuck can you legalize that?!?!
There is nothing about America that I like. Nothing. And I judge the country by their actions. 

Germany are now the good guys and Americans are the nazi fascists. 

What a time to be alive. üôÑ
They don't want trans people gone, they want them to be the minority to blame, sadly, similar to what Nazi germany did with the Jewish peoples.
I feel terribly sry for every Trans Person living in North Dakota:/
North Dakota has less than a million people. Let's all move there and fuck up their voter demography for the lols.
And yet they wonder why nobody cares about their stupid ass bumblefuck state!!! Fuck North Dakota!
Why dose the US suck so much?

I just wanna be a cute girl and have cuddles damnit. qwq
I don‚Äôt know if this is allowed here, but‚Ä¶maybe it‚Äôs time we organize. Consider the state of racial inequality and overt violence toward people of color post-WWII‚Ä¶now think, ‚ÄúThe Black Panther Party for Self-Defense‚Äù. If you‚Äôre not familiar, maybe get familiar. They‚Äôre responsible for things like free breakfast at school and free sickle cell anemia testing. They realized the cold hard facts of being brutalized and murdered by their own government and fought back. Maybe it‚Äôs time for us to fight back, particularly if they‚Äôre going to try to kill us anyway.
Y'all need gay people rioting in the streets
Remember friends, it is easy to aquire agency increasing materials in the USA. You just need to be willing to put in the work.
They can't even enforce half of these.
Honestly...what bad, horrific thing have we done to deserve this? I just want to live my life in peace.
Hello, I'm not American. How the fuck does banning establishments from organizing their bathrooms however the fuck they want fit with ""free country""?
I hate my home state so much. North Dakota has always been disappointing. It just has been getting progressively worse. The only reason to come here is that you want a cheaper place to live and to drink your face off.
So would that ban all single stall bathrooms like ones intended for people with disabilities cause it‚Äôs gonna get a lot of people screwed over. I see that causing outrage they don‚Äôt expect
Science!
If there's ever like a GoFundMe to send Erin and her girlfriend on a tropical vacation I will donate to it in a moment. Her work documenting all this stuff must be so draining.
so tired of this.
I know it‚Äôs being pedantic and not at all what they meant, but wouldn‚Äôt banning unisex bathrooms mean that bathrooms are required to allow multiple sexes in?

Why does unisex mean gender neutral?
I cannot believe I am saying this, but I am beginning to appreciate TERF island, despite its imperfections.
Sigh. As a truck driver I'm going to have to eventually openly walk around with a weapon in these states, using the men's bathroom (I still use it but don't pass)
alright so all houses have to have gendered bathrooms ig
Fucking hate living in the upside down
Ban college bathrooms? Like all together? Colleges can‚Äôt have toilets?
Republucan politics are hate politics, against American minorities.
What! They want to ban ALL college bathrooms??
Ik they might not like you all but wtf
‚ÄúLand of the free‚Äù
Let‚Äôs just go ahead and ban bathrooms all together why don‚Äôt we all just piss on the fucking floor
Those mf wont stop us from being who we want to be
Why would you ban anyone from a unisex bathroom? It‚Äôs fucking unisex
So they'd need gendered bathrooms in their houses now?

But in all seriousness, this makes me so mad. üò≠
Wow. I don‚Äôt get why we can‚Äôt just be ourselves. And they are making conversion therapy legal? It‚Äôs not therapy it‚Äôs traumatic abuse.
How can everything go so backwards. üò¢
I say we legalize conversion therapy and use it on christian nationalists to make them not shit ass people‚Ä¶ my god what in the hell is going on in this country
only if us Americans would protest like the French we would get somewhere
i started reading through what she was saying on it and literally had to stop for my own mental health, it‚Äôs bad, yall
They don‚Äôt want us using any bathroom at all not even a single restroom
""When they show you who they are, believe them"" said Maya Angelou. Well the fascists really have shown us who they are.
Was stationed in noeth dokota for 5ish years the bible freaks are so awful
Question: what will this entire community do if legislation is never passed and you aren't given the rights you want/deserve. What is the next step?
""Free country"" my ass
wait couldn‚Äôt someone with wisdom write up a law and propose it just like these wackos did?
I'll get the torches and pitchforks...
Shit like this makes Colorado look like paradise compared to the rest of the US...
Conversion therapy?!?!?! Wtf???? Did they forget how awful that sh*t ended up in the 50s? It never works and is just bs!!!!
Jesus Damn...
I think it‚Äôs disgusting that any state would go out of their way to outlaw a group of people. But if straight people and all the closeted freaks want ND, maybes it best if we let them have it.
Where we are going to do our ‚Äúbusiness‚Äù? Our own bathroom at home are unisex. So these people want us to hold at the university until we can find where to do it? Conversion to what? To be transphobic? So trans youth have to live a lie? Is it lying a sin? Is it one of the 10 commandments ‚ÄúYou shall love your neighbor as yourself‚Äù?  ü§î
We need to build bonds within our local communities and organize. üñ§
This is genocide.
I don't know how Erin does this without going mad. She's constantly on top of all this depressing news while it only takes me a glance at one of her tweets before I'm done for the day. Erin if you see this, thank you
Non of this should be ‚Äúdebatable‚Äù just leave us TF ALONE I‚Äôm soooooo over it..
It is insane how public the hate has become. It‚Äôs almost surreal to think SO MANY PEOPLE are blindly repeating history over and over-
Pretty sure I'm not allowed to promote crimes so...
Everybody make sure ""not"" to do anything drastic involving explosives
Thanks ‚ô°
Are these red states ever gonna redeem themselves?
Personally I have no plans of sitting back and letting them
Seeing stuff like this makes me wanna just roll over 
I guess if they want me gone so bad I‚Äôll go back to presenting more fem 
I don‚Äôt want to do that but I‚Äôm so tired of this
I want to vomit literally all over the place. Fuck this shit
this is actually absurd
why
But but but trans kids are all just evil perverts who go through so much pain and want to end their lives because they want to get in the other sexes pants üò¢
I wish for exactly the same to be done to these people as they wish for me. I will not elaborate further.
I was born in North Dakota. They are a hateful state unless your straight, cis, and white. The whole state is one big white trash trailer park. I moved to South Dakota because it's so much nicer here. Come to find out we are the same thing here. 

Fuck the Dakotas back wood bullshit.
We just need to build an island where the LGBT community is allowed and no one else cause we can't seem to live with anyone not in the community
Could their agenda be any clearer now
So for those that don't have ovaries/testes, how are we supposed to live without hrt. We need hormones to keep our body healthy, wether we're transitioning or not. I'm mtf and I can't even get hrt for testosterone tho???
It may get bad, before it gets better, we need to stay vigilant and keep fighting for our rights, time will put them on the wrong side of the civil rights movement.  As with the fight for women's rights, black rights gay rights now us, seems the government just wants something to fight, they inevitably lose
Erin is doing amazing work for the trans community! Thank you!
Why does society hate us?
I'm fearful for my future, I hope I turn 18 before any bans on young people's hrt over here in the UK if we're headed down that road too
This is terryfying
Is this some sort of stupidity contest with South Dakota?
These fuckers really do. I'm so sorry.

I feel scared for those of you in the US, I keep seeing these bills in this state, that state...

And I feel powerless. Is there anything I can do from outside to help?
Hello american Taliban!
sadness. seems like the states really isnt the place to go to once i graduate at this rate.
I live in Italy thank God üíÄ
Meh, we don‚Äôt need North Dakota. 49 states is plenty.

The first steps of genocide

'But Jesus said...' (No, he didn't)
As a watersports fetishist I support the ban on college bathrooms, people can piss on the floor or in their pants as they wish /s
This is just full genocidal hate. No laws need or should exist outlining how trans people can and cannot use their bodies. 

The sports bullshit is a non sequitur ‚Äúissue‚Äù. Phobes throw all these what if hypotheticals and no hard, concrete proof. When the answer is this: cis women caught ‚Äúdoping‚Äù serve x time and allowed to compete. Should be the same for trans women. Enough said.
> I literally cannot believe the people who MAKE our laws still believe that litterbox bullshit. 

they don't, at least most of them. but they know it will get them votes
The bar is very low for state lawmakers and most of them are mostly influenced by local extremists. 

Getting involved with local politics is the best way to combat this in your area.
Hi, so I live in ND.   How can I do anything to stop this?
fucking LITTERBOX BAN IN SCHOOLS???? a ban for a thing that never even happened??!??? the people who run america are actually stupid as fuck
I think some or most of the people involved in writing these bill know exactly what it is - its used to stoke the fires of hate in the gullible.
i mean there was at least 1 case of a litter box in a classroom, but it‚Äôs not for the reason LoTT says. [It‚Äôs ACTUALLY for students to use in case of an active shooter](https://www.insider.com/colorado-teachers-get-human-litter-boxes-for-lockdowns-2019-8?amp) but they‚Äôd never openly admit that
Can you please provide the source for the bill regarding the litterboxes?
Tf is a litter box
yeah, same here

i just want to live out the rest of my days peacefully as a woman, without having to worry about shit like this and basically having to be a step up above 90% of the people i talk to.
You don't have to keep reading the news. What good is it doing anyone to hurt yourself in this way? 

Let the people who are able fight these bills. You don't need to listen so closely to it. Find some other way to change the world a little. Maybe there's a local group trying to protect a small area of wildlife. Maybe there's something else.
Literally..
America as a ""free country"" has always been a lie. Just ask anyone who is not a straight, white, Christian male.
IKR! How am I supposed to keep living here without constantly getting more miserable every time I hear an outrageous news story like this?! PROGRESS IS NOT SUPPOSED TO GO BACKWARDS LIKE THIS! WE ARE SUPPOSED TO BECOME BETTER OVER TIME! THIS IS INSANE!!
It will get only worse though.
There's three of us.
Just three of us.
There's him and you and me
there's three of us

edit: damn someone beat me to it
With the amount of suffering they cause millions? Yeah i say its only fair they feel a world of pain
They've never felt what actual oppression is like and if they did they would never have the brain wrinkles to make the connection that other people can feel feelings too. I'm afraid if we flipped this on them they would use it as fuel to be Christian nationalist martyrs

They refer to people as NPCs like it's cool to normalize being a fucking psychopath and having no empathy
They should suffer much more than we do.
Go to their house and \[removed by Reddit\]
Does the morality of torture depend on the context...?ü§î

/j, i don't condone torture against anyone but do I think they deserve it? Probably...
They will hun. The same people that think God will smite us will take care of them. I believe God sends transphobes and homophobes to hell for their hate. Just my own beliefs.
You sure that ain't just self care?
if i remember correctly (and i'm pretty sure i do) there was a case that went to the supreme court that ruled that yes there is freedom of religion but not freedom from religion. so basically in short, they can practice whatever crazy ass bullshit belief they want for their angry sky daddy but the rest of us with a functioning brain have to sit back and be subjected to it regardless of our beliefs.
It's only free for those politicians to be honest. We need to makes sure it will be the other way.
Anyone who argues with, or has a problem with the phrase ""trans rights"" is a bigot, full stop.
Smh, those are the Same people that get mad about black rights
I'm in Florida too but I have too much negativity in my life and don't watch the news... what should I be concerned about? üò¨ I mean, the governor clearly doesn't like the lgbtq+ community and is acting on it as much as he can, but I hadn't heard anything trans-specific. I wouldn't be surprised if he tried to pull this sh!t, too.
Don‚Äôt forget about DIY, that‚Äôs always an option as well. Also filing it under insurance as ‚Äúendocrine disorder not otherwise specified‚Äù.
I‚Äôm so sorry
you're not alone here, us trans north dakotans can protect each other ‚ù§Ô∏è
Unisex bathrooms? The often single occupancy restrooms that both genders can use? Damn, it is targeted and a genocide.
Or just leave that dreadful state
I doubt that the US will be the only country that will do this.
Yep, for Jesus.
I wonder if they ban them everywhere‚Ä¶. That would make the bathroom in your home illegal
Hate is not rational
we also make people question the hegemonic ideas of sex equals gender and those are fixed and stable (and that genitals somehow dictate personality) and somehow mutually exclusive
I think religion is a facet, but even religion doesn't explain prior sentiments toward transgender individuals. Look for example at the Public Universal Friend, an agender person in the 1800s who was a pastor until their death by edema, who has been criticized as a fraud at times but otherwise lived an ordinary life.

I think that there are modern cultural factors to blame. The rise of rugged individualism and anti-communist sentiments. Which leads to an enforcement of inheritance standards, ownership, and the nuclear family. Which leads to class division. Which leads to the commodification of sexuality and reproduction to protect resources and class. Which leads to the rise of resentment toward that commodity for wanting control of itself. Which leads to stricter gender roles around who is the obtainer and who is the obtainee of such commodities, and enforcing a clear and obvious standard as to which resources are worth obtaining (i.e., which ones have the ability to get pregnant and aren't a risk of becoming pregnant by other partners).

Transphobia, patriarchy, misogyny, homophobia, racism, and more are inseparable from one another and part of a widespread milieu of negative cultural forces that have been building to a head for decades. The fear of communism stirred the generation currently still in control of the government into a fever. The Red Scare never ended.
Idk. A lot of transphobes I know are staunch reddit-type atheists, people who think they‚Äôre super ‚Äúrational‚Äù and think they‚Äôre science experts because they read a richard dawkins book once. I think that religion certainly fuels transphobia very severely, but unfortunately if religion magically disappeared, I don‚Äôt think transphobia would necessarily disappear with it.
I don't really see how it is. I only read the old testament, and there are no conflicts there.
It's not the cause, but often an excuse. Don't let transphobes hide behind religion
I'd specifically its the Christian and the Islamic religions honestly. The norse religion, hinduism, and buddhism are neutral at worst and celebratory of trans people at best.
I worked with a guy from Bosnia several years ago. Survived the war in the early 90s and fled his country and moved to several places in Europe before finally landing in the USA. He would tell me all the time how he would hear how free it is here but what bullshit that actually was. ‚ÄúI have music on at my house it‚Äôs 915 and police show up tell me I have to turn it down, this is free country?, in my country music on at night means party! Everyone cone over have good time! If cops show up they also there to party and have good time! You call this free, get out of here with that shit‚Äù lol I used to love just listening to him rant
america was only the land of the free for white men, the founding fathers were slave owners and refused to give black people ""inalienable rights"" because that would harm their plantations

its unsurprising america is terrible for minorities and my heart goes out to all our trans siblings suffering there
honestly im just glad i live in illinois its not the best but its a whole lot better than most places in the usa
The cruelty is the point. Their constituents care more about ‚Äúhurting the right people‚Äù than making any positive change in society or peoples‚Äô lives. And the politicians are happy to oblige.
...a return to out houses?
They just unbanned it in my state (wisconsin) the other week. Fucking awful
I truly hope you and your fellow fire elementals don‚Äôt.
""not caring"" is the best - if everyone were genuinely not caring, considering it a standard, would make my life way better.
Yep. Thats why politicians lobbying against us is so damaging. They make so many people unaware of how bad it is
""Love"" is the type of a word that lately doesn't exist as much as it's supposed to.
I have decided to believe Heaven and Hell exist, but the only thing differentiating them is who‚Äôs there, with ‚ÄúHeaven‚Äù being a constant battle royals between conservatives with nobody but each other around to hate, and hell being everyone else building a society of immortals with actual civil rights. It‚Äôll definitely still have issues, but it‚Äôll be pretty chill.
The US also attempted genocide during WWII, but nobody remembers that because they won. This disgusting excuse for a country being full of nazis isn‚Äôt new.
The genocide has already began, we will not falter to their hate.
What a relief!
Please do I am so fucking scared rn
I‚Äôm not sure that would work.
Shit man,,, this may not be a bad idea
It's coming soon.
It's going to happen. History repeats itself.
The only one I see that they can't enforce is the college bathroom ban, the rest they absolutely can and will enforce, which is frightening to say the least.
It doesn't. They don't care. The cruelty is the point.
It's like banning hormone blockers

It's not even *just* for trans people :/,
She's an incredible human being.
They're so thoroughly convinced its a mental illness and 'you can be fixed'. It's funny because a lot of the same people will balk at the idea of therapy or treating mental issues with medication, insisting you just gotta be tougher, because 'past generations didn't have any of that shit', when really both mental illness and gender nonconformity (using this as a stand-in for anything queer) existed just as much back then, but society did a much more thorough job or ostracizing or otherwise ignoring them. There was a lot more 'aunt in the asylum' 'weird uncle' and 'cousin who died young' back then, that could have just been another person in society if society hadn't been that way.

It's always been this way, but now that society is finally starting to understand, even a little, some people are pushing back, because we're daring to change the status quo.
Lol they tried that before in liberia. It kinda turned out shitty
Appeal to your National leader's make them convince the American politicians to stop being dicks.
If they won't listen to the American people they might listen to people who know what they're talking about.
Ummmmmmm‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. America sucks yeah, but I dont think you realize just how bad it is in china. 


And even **IF** it were the case that they were more accepting, I‚Äôd still rather not live in a literal authoritarian hellhole.



Edit: this commenter is a tankie. Ignore them.
If you support our struggle, how about you keep your uninformed opinions out of this? What the heck do you know about gender and gender identity anyway. How about you actually listen to trans people?

And guess what. Not allowing a trans child puberty blockers *is* a life altering decision.

You're being transphobic and very degrading toward all trans people. You just don't believe that gender identity is a thing do you? Maybe educate yourself before you speak on this.
Hormone blockers are the opposite of a life altering decision. If they decide to stop, puberty will start as normal, just a delayed start. You can't undo puberty though. It's a reasonable compromise, leaving the decision until they turn 18 as to which kind of puberty they want to pursue.
Jesus would be so very disappointed
technically I think it was technically God (lord can mean God and Jesus) but, Do not go about spreading slander among your people ([Leviticus 19:16](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus+19%3A16&version=NIV)) and love your neighbor as yourself. ([Leviticus 19:18](https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Leviticus%2019%3A18&version=NIV))

I can already hear evangelical Christians complaining about my usage of the OT...
And even if he did, not everyone even believes he existed, and no one can prove it. So why are we making decisions based on what inviso-daddy in the sky; who will tell you he loves you in the same breath as pulling a Job on you (everyone should read the story of Job once in their lives. It'll prove to you why you SHOULDN'T follow Jehova/Yahwai) would want? It sounds like a ( debunked ) Stockholm Syndrom.

Hard PASS.
yup, people are fed lies that they believe because they WANT to be outraged because that's the culture that's been perpetuated since the cold war.
And it‚Äôs an easy win. Nobody is going to think a litter box is acceptable, which of course it isn‚Äôt and it‚Äôs not even a thing in this context, but getting the ball rolling with a clickbait bill everyone can agree on and be outraged at makes it that little bit easier to roll into the next and subsequent bills that actually will harm people and actually do need to be opposed.

They are also starting with the youth as again - easy target, easy to create outrage, easy to get support behind as you can throw in hyperbole and if that doesn‚Äôt work you make up bullshit that people will believe despite zero evidence.  And on it goes. Get that lot through and you can start creating hell for adults. Other states and countries watch on, the conservatives see what works, what needs tweaking, they get ideas and they now have examples of precedents.

Meanwhile actual stuff is happening that needs actual legislation to actually help people and make a difference. Absolutely nobody will benefit from any of this other than the terfs having more ammunition and bigger smiles, and politicians using it to get more donations so they can hurt more people. The flip side is this will absolutely destroy lives, people will die, and so so many will suffer and struggle.

Stop the world please, I‚Äôm feeling sick and really want to get off now üòî

Former ND resident here! Best thing to do is get involved with your local precincts representatives. I‚Äôve brought issues up with them, and have seen them ask my question to the state legislature. If you can‚Äôt do that look, go east.

Not to mention a ""man"" choosing to identify as a woman brings into question the Xtian idea that men are inherently the superior gender.
There are many factors.  Mostly ignorance.  But, Religion preaches Man and Woman unity.  That's it.  No exceptions.  It's their Controlling heirarchy system that does not want us around, to lure the SHEEP away.  You either accept Christ and do his bidding, or you are the enemy.  It's become less life and death these days.  But in the days of old, if you want to survive, you assimilate with Christianity, or some other religion.  Or you get cast outside the walls to fend for yourself.
Religion is way more of a factor than anti communist sentiments are or were. Yikes
That sort of staunch atheism ironically becomes a religion in and of itself. ""Religion is bad for humanity, because Dawkins said so, and anyone who disagrees with Dawkins is wrong and should be punished for being wrong so that we may convert them to Dawkinsism.""
Impossible argument there.  Because if you are inferring Religion never was, then there is a possibility that transphobia never was.  

I still go to church occasionally, with my wife, or listen on line.  The message overall is good.  BUT, finding a good church is like finding a good therapist.  Some are good, some are horrible.
It‚Äôs not about the Bible. religious interpretations of the Bible by ‚Äúman‚Äù is to blame.
One‚Äôs freedom should not infringe on another. Just like your religious beliefs or lack thereof should not dictate how I have to live my life.

Hold on. I'm familiar with the genocide of Natice Americans between the 1500-1800s. Then the illegal imprisonment of Japanese Americans from 1942 to 1946.

Evangelicals often use the old testament to point at stuff they consider wrong and sinful. But then that same book of laws, Leviticus, also has passages about not eating pork or wearing mixed fibers and other archaic 4000 year old laws like that. In fact, although it's been decades since I went to church, I'm pretty sure there's an excerpt in the new testament where Jesus basically says the old laws and old covenant are obsolete.
It‚Äôs still important because other states copy legislation that passes.
Me. Because you can't change it for the better of you live in another state.

> But, Religion preaches Man and Woman unity.

Yeah but the originator of that was infant mortality first, plus commodification of reproduction in a scarcity society. Religion is just another byproduct and enforcement system though, not the originating cultural (and evolutionary) driver.

Now, the cultural driver is a fear of post-scarcity and generational habit-forming. Post-scarcity society is a threat to those who have power over a scarcity society, because it means that all of their generations and centuries of work to succeed in that society will become meaningless. So they manufacture scarcity and enforce the standards of their society more fiercely than before.

Edited to clarify language.
And ironically it's PRECISELY their anti-LGBTQ+ ideology that's driving people away. So what do they do? Double down of course.
Religion is and has always been a way for the powerful to control the meek. Assuming that religion comes from itself is for those who are actually religious. Humans created religion, for a reason.

Some things don't change. If you wanted to educate yourself on this, you could. I'm not going to waste my time trying to inform you. It's ignorant people like you who help pave the way for trans genocide.

I suppose next you're going to tell me there's a cabal out there transing kids or whatever.
Next you're going to tell me brain isn't fully developed until 25, and argue for banning all trans healthcare until then too. Because this is just a lifestyle choice or whatever.

We're talking about *healthcare* for *trans youth*. How about not denying life-saving care for people? What are you basing your arguments on anyway, except your feelings? As I say, read up or keep your ignorant opinions out of this.
Yes they thought people were identifying as cats or something I don't know the whole story
Some schools keep litter around because it's very helpful in cleaning up messes like if a student vomits or something nasty spills. Someone, likely a teacher who knows this, or an incredibly ignorant parent who doesn't, intentionally spread the lie that it was for students to go to the bathroom in ""because look how insane trans people make things"".
There's a whole concept out there that middle/high school ""furries"" have demanded litterboxes to use the bathroom at their schools.

I'm sure a couple people have been quirky enough to actually try to do so, but in this case, it's essentially conservatives latching like pit pulls onto the concept as a ""slippery slope"" argument against trans minors. Basically, ""if we allow minors to transition and respect it, what's stopping us from allowing them to transition to animals???""

It's exactly the same ""slippery slope"" argument they used against gay marriage. Now we're gonna have to legally allow people to marry their horses/refrigerators/etc!
> i mean not rly, but i thought that people would be more progressive nowdays, and not basically do shit that hither did but on a much smaller scale.

People are. That's why all these bills are being introduced, the people who write them and agree with them know that the days of their ideology are numbered. The Millennial generation has become the largest voting bloc within the past two elections and Generation Z has the most voting power due to its' increased rates of political participation than previous generations. What do these two generations exhibit? Significantly increased rates of acceptance of LGBT people. This is why these politicians are acting so unhinged and revealing their hand - they're in their death throes right now. They're trying to make a mess of the apartment before getting forcibly evicted.

And the *""society rly is de-evolving""* stuff is the same reactionary rhetoric that conservatives and other regressives use and believe in. Take care that you don't fall into that same way of thinking, that's exactly how they want you to think so that you'll get bummed out and less likely to fight. There was no ""golden past"" that we can return to, and to suggest so is completely ignorant of history.

Things are so much better nowadays. To give an example, just in the past 10 years the requirement that most states had in 2013 for SRS to be done to change somebody's gender on their identifying documents has been removed in most states, it's just an administrative and legal process now. To give another example, many of our LGBT elders say that this tool we call the internet is something they could have never began to dream of when they were fighting for rights and acceptance. The internet and mobile phones allow us to achieve levels of communication, organisation, and activism that we never could before. It's nothing short of a miracle.
I didn't think stupid, ignorant, arrogant and delusional could co-exist in one body, then I look at my brother...

I second forcing politicians into hamster wheels.
Ah fair, how do you feel about hydrogen powered tanks?
Before I transitioned, I literally did this once. I went into the men‚Äôs room (mind you these are single occupancy) and it looked like a f‚Äôing murder scene. I moved right to the ladies room only to be yelled at by the store clerk for using the ‚Äúwrong‚Äù bathroom. There was no way, even in the Bible Belt where I lived at the time I was using that men‚Äôs room.
These are the same people who also support corporate greed despite greed literally being one of the 7 deadly sins in the Bible.
You know what's fucked? If they actually lived like Christ we would all be accepted for who we are.
If it was better men actually knew how to talk about their feelings.
None of that matters now......  The largest club in the world does not want us to exist.  They preach it weekly.  Even though they misread what their BIBLE says about us.
>Post-scarcity society is a threat to those who have power over a scarcity society, because it means that all of their generations and centuries of work to succeed in that society will become meaningless. So they manufacture scarcity and enforce the standards of their society more fiercely than before.

This reminds me so much of the Azadian Empire from The Player of Games. They had the technological means for a post-scarcity society like that of the Culture, but scarcity and hierarchical domination were artificially enforced so that their ancient power structures could continue to self-propagate.
good point
I'm sorry to hear that. I hope you are able to stay safe for the time being, and able to get out when you can (if that is what you want to do). We would love to have you on the west coast.
I thought those were in case there is a school shooting and a lockdown and children need to pee
yep i get ya, its defo better nowdays, but it is still saddening to see all this shit happen.
This was a breath of fresh air, thank you so much. I used to believe firmly in this and all these posts recently have gotten my anxiety up and I let myself get caught up in the rhetoric.

This grounded me again, thankyou.

Edit: Also wanted to remind everyone that we just got gay marriage ratified into the constitution y'all.
And you can‚Äôt see that the other side supports and benefits from that corporate greed just like them? Both sides are playing the same greed game with the general population getting screwed footing the bill without even a kiss.
Jesus sounds like the type of a guy that would accept everyone, and treat everyone equally.
supposedly they are, but are actively discouraged from doing so...too ""girly"" apparently...
That's because the Bible comes from them, they don't come from the Bible. The club is just a rallying point. But absent that rallying point there are plenty of others. And we ignore those others at our peril. Plenty of irreligious bigots.
The Bible says nothing about us other than one verse in Deuteronomy about crossdressing (I identify as female so I‚Äôm not really crossdressing when I‚Äôm my real self) that some cling to while ignoring the verses about not eating shrimp, cheeseburgers, or bacon, driving on the Sabbath, etc‚Ä¶because the OT law no longer applies, except you know the stuff against LGBT, Piercings, Tattoos, and anything else that makes certain folks uncomfortable.

Then there‚Äôs the verse that humans were created male and female which at best could be misused against non-binary people but doesn‚Äôt really apply to trans persons who identify as one or the other.

Transphobia is a case of Eisegesis or reading into a text what you want to believe so the text can ‚Äúsupport‚Äù you. It‚Äôs the opposite of Exegesis and a lot of people are guilty of it.
It so disappoints me that sci-fi of that era gave us so many good cautionary tales without guides on how to prevent them \^_\^;
It's really funny to me that these people call themselves the ""silent majority"" because when you do all the math it boils down to them just being the loudest 13% of the population.
We do want to leave here, I want to go to the west cost but we're worried about the cost of living

For sure. They're everywhere.  But it's PREACHED at church.  Even though we are all HUMAN.
We're on the same page.  The BIBLE is fine.  It's ""man's"" interpretation that is being Preached.  And they are wrong.
Do you have any queer friends in better states who could possibly help you organize a move? Who'd let you stay with them for a few weeks while you plan your next steps?
I don't see anything such as ""it's bad to be gay/trans"" in the instructions.

It's also preached by edgy dudes on 4chan who haven't been to church in over a decade if ever though. Church is the building that lets them gather to do it. Rallying points are about raising a flag so those of like minds can flock to it, organize, and recruit others. The OK hand symbol. The swastika. The cross. A series of books about a boy who finds out he's a wizard. They're just rallying points for hatred.

But our flags are rallying points for us.
Yep. 

If they have to acknowledge that their behavior toward us is wrong, they have to acknowledge A LOT of their behavior is wrong.

If the reason truly is because male puberty gives trans girls an advantage, they should ban any athlete with any advantage.

Also I hate using the ""athlete"" in this context because they are literally school children playing for fun and exercise. It's not the freaking Olympics and people don't place bets on high school football games.
""the government has too much power. We want less government (unless it's to regulate those transgendereded confused kids or women's bodies)"".  Idiots
""Puberty tips the scale, sport should be segregated by sex""

- Okay, well lets talk about that more in depth and strive to make sports an equal playing field for everyone! Kids are allowed to play together though right?

""...""

- Right..?
As an FTNB on testosterone therapy, my initial interpretation of that was ""male puberty"" being what my body is doing right now, so they were arguing that trans men have an inherent advantage over cis women, and therefore shouldn't be forced to play with them.

But, no, they're only obsessed with the trans women in sports.
Recent studies show there is no clear advantage, if at all, for trans (mtf) athletes.

People seem to want to pretend all cis bodies are the same so there is genetic parity. That‚Äôs absolute bs. And professional sport is mental as well as physical, something else completely ignored.

It‚Äôs also a patronising argument against cis women - the notion that anyone who at one time possessed a penis and some extra testosterone is better than they are by default is insulting af.

Anyone seen female wrestling? Bfs a big wwe fan. I‚Äôm 6‚Äô2‚Äù, about 200lbs and this trans woman would be scared to get in the ring with those women, they would snap me in half.

It‚Äôs not about gender or physical equality, it‚Äôs about trying to take away anything that could be part of a normal life from a trans person. I wholeheartedly agree that the government needs to stay out of my and everyone else‚Äôs metaphorical pants.

While it‚Äôs sad to see how downvoted your comment was, I also laugh a bit, I must be getting a thick skin to the hate. I‚Äôm laughing because I‚Äôm like damn, you call they come a runnin like chickens for supper. Cluck cluck, bawk! Lol.

Keep your heads up my siblings, love you all!
Unpopular opinion: people stress about the trans community in sports because they inherently believe, consciously or not, that (cis) men > (cis) women. The reality is: the only reason you see less pro women athletes is because of lack of funding, difficult access to facilities, social stigma, etc.
The funny thing is, there are exactly *zero* reputable scientific studies demonstrating trans women retain testosterone-associated athletic advantages after ~2 years of feminizing HRT.  There‚Äôs a reason why trans athletes have been allowed to compete at the Olympics for almost **TWENTY YEARS**.  (And also why in that same period, we‚Äôve had exactly *one* trans Olympian‚Äî and she didn‚Äôt even make it past Prelims.)
I mean i think dividing by division would just be the answer over gender in general, lol.  There‚Äôs mixed gender sports all over, just do it based on division of physical ability regardless of gender.  Test the athletes and compete them against people in similar classes.
I‚Äôve not heard of any studies, valid peer reviewed ones, that conclude ‚Äúthere is an inherent advantage ‚Äú.  Please direct me to them if there are any.
*inhales,* they're CHILDREN. Children that want to play ball with their friends. Just let them play! Don't we have bigger issues to deal with right now? It's a game. It's not like it has any sociopolitical significance. People need to just leave these kids alone, I really agree with you.
""Small government"" fans when someone suggests small government
If you recognize 'em, how 'bout linkin' to 'em?
Sports are ALL ABOUT people with ""unfair advantages"" because of genetics, growth during puberty. nutrition, etc. being the winners.

""It's no FAIR! She only beat me in the race because she's a faster RUNNER than I am!!!!!!""
yall remembee the olympic swimmer? her times went down pretty drastically once she started estrogen and she lost plenty of races in women's competitions. transphobes will find any, and every reason to stop a trans person from succeeding or diss on any accomplishments they make. i lost a lot of ""friends"" when that came up.
I can guarantee that most of those downvotes are parents that scream at elementary school referees.
In reality there are not that many trans athletes around. Like 1 out of thousands. Banning trans people from competing make no sense considering they don't push much of an advantage to the team because of their low numbers. And just like trans athletes, most athletes have something in their body (like being extra tall, or fast) that gives them the ability to make it so high in the first place. So in conclusion, if you wanted to make sports ""fair"", then ban 90% of all athletes making sports officially boring
Oooh so is that why that texas high school forced Mack Beggs to fucking body cis girls on the girls wrestling team once he started T bc they wouldnt allow him to wrestle on the boys team?? Is this why transphobes used videos of that and called him a trans woman to push this argument that they need to protect girls like it wasnt their own design to hurt cis girls in order to maintain transphobia??? 

EDIT Mack fought this the entire time and they still put him and his opponents thru this for *years* (literally until he graduated) and proved cis girls are just collateral damage to them if it means maintaining transphobic status quos. Protecting the girls in this case would have been letting Mack play on the boys team, but they refused to let that happen and in the process blatantly showed their true motives
‚ÄúNo! Kids are innocent they shouldn‚Äôt have to face these *‚Äôdifficult‚Äô* social issues! But the trans kids?‚Ä¶ nah tell them they are terrorizing our country, shame them and send them to hell idgaf‚Äù - Daddy Government

How dare you question the importance given to these almost inexistant issues by our elected officials? Questioning how they spend our taxes on top of that? What's next? Voting rights?!?!

It seems that some people really care about holding on to their moral panic. ü§®
They also ignore the fact that after a significant amount of time on HRT, that advantage is reversed.
‚ÄúThe government needs to get out of my business but needs to get deep into yours‚Äù
I always find so stupid that argument of 'male puberty' like just because someone were through male puberty automatically get super strength
Remember guys, all they want is the smallest federal government possible to invade everyone's privacy to prevent people from exercising basic rights like doctor/patient confidentiality or playing school sports.
I know there‚Äôs no actual real advantage for trans people. But would it not just be easier to sort sports by weight or height? That means people will be even no matter what.
Touch my nerves UwU. Also I agree with you.
Their argument is a great one for why we should allow access to puberty blockers
In Kansas, I remember hearing that the transgender sports ban would affect all of 2 people.
Brought to you by the party of small government!
Just mention trans, in any capacity. Even if refered to others and not yourself, and you'll be downvoted for being the minority.

Love the human race.
So I don‚Äôt know if this is the right place to ask, but what‚Äôs everyone‚Äôs take on making all sports co-ed? 

I think they‚Äôre are plenty of cis-women that can physically compete in a cis-man sport. So then everyone plays regardless of sex or gender.
114 down votes?? Damn, I'm jealous. I never figured out how to upset hundreds of people so easily. Teach me please.
The party of self-regulation and personal responsibility can't deal with middle school girls soccer being self-regulated. Bunch of hypocrites.
It's unfortunate, too, because ***they're dead wrong.*** Having to go through a male puberty before a female one provides *no advantage.* In fact, estrogenic puberty in a body naturally inclined towards an androgenic one tends to come with side effects that affect the field of sport far more than any perceived ""advantage"". 

For starters, trans women tend to have lower testosterone and hemoglobin levels compared to cis women. Given the fact that testosterone and hemoglobin are essential for recovery after heavy exercise, we're actually at a *disadvantage* when it comes to elite sport. Any form of gender transition hormonally also tends to come with increased insulin resistance, which makes it more difficult to put on muscle and easier to put on fat. It also has detrimental effects on bone density and joint health, meaning trans people in general will have shorter competitive careers than their cis counterparts before having to retire for their own health.

The reality is that trans folks are at a disadvantage in sport. Anyone that says otherwise simply isn't versed on the most up-to-date science, and should be pointed towards the list of trans olympians so they can quickly shut up.
So looked into it and Olympic level scientists whose responsibility is ensuring fairness (via blood doping testing, drug screening etc) cannot say that being transgender provides an unfair advantage or not (seems to depend on the specific sport).

Their reason.  There just isn't enough trans athletes (sample size would be too small).  And if that's what people whose job is ensuring biological/chemical fairness are saying, then wtf are these non-expert lawmakers basing their policies off of?
Bigotry, pure and simple.
Republicans:  We support small, limited government and trust organizations to regulate themselves.

Also Republicans: ...NO NOT LIKE THAT!!! üò±üò±üò±
honestly? skill issue for the other athletes
Funny how going through female puberty reverses male puberty, which is totally not scientifically backed.
Even the Olympics recognizes trans athletes and base which gender you compete in by hormone levels
Correct me if I'm wrong here, but wasn't there a study showing that trans girls that went through HRT had a higher estrogen level than cis women and thus had a disadvantage in sports?
How about we talk about the real solution here, let trans kids take HRT during puberty and this wouldn‚Äôt be an issue! But nope! They just want to force trans kids to develop with what they‚Äôre born as just to further their agenda.
conservatives when they talk publicly: ""big government bad! we're the party of freedom!""

conservatives in their legislation: ""let us choose exactly how you live your life""
I love how they claim to ‚Äúknow the subject‚Äù yet can‚Äôt seem to grasp that taking estrogen actually has an effect on muscle mass and such
Sounds like the conservatives that don't like ""Big Government/regulations"" only dislike them when it fits their narrative
I find it very funny that the people who claim to believe in small government are also the people who want to have the state ban me from playing dodgeball
I mean doesn't evidence also show any """"""advantage"""""" male puberty gives people pretty much gets undone with hrt???
You get lots of love from reddit when you support trans people outside of LGBT+ subs..
So I believe that person made those studies up and if they didn't there probably still wouldn't be enough data to call it conclusive. If I remember correctly it's shown that women who compete in sports usually have higher testosterone levels than men that compete in those same sports regardless of what gender they were assigned at birth. Also there is no evidence that transitioning in either direction affects performance positively in any sport. Of course there isn't much evidence either way considering there isn't a huge population of trans people to begin with and only a percentage of them would be interested in sports and an even smaller percentage would be willing to be studied properly. So sample sizes are limited.
Whatever happened to ‚Äúsmall government‚Äù?
Personally, I like the idea that we stop segregating sports by gender and instead group kids (and adults, for that matter) by either ability or other physiological factors relevant to each sport,  like how combat sports have weight classes.
i was arguing with someone in instagram comments or something
and i said ‚Äúi think trans women are women should be able to use the women‚Äôs restroom and play on women sports teams. transgender people deserve to be treated like the rest of us‚Äù

and the person i was arguing with was like
‚Äúim not talking about transgender im talking about gender fluid they are so different üôÑüôÑ anyway i dont want men in my prisons what if i man lies and says he identifies as a woman and-‚Äú

and they just  k e p t  g o i n g

i do not think they know what genderfluid means
The ‚Äúpeople should be able to make their own rules without the government‚Äôs interference‚Äù crowd when the choices the majority make aren‚Äôt in their favor.
Most American sports teams are run by local governments, called school boards.     

The privately run leagues like the NFL, NBA, and MLB allow women to join.
At this point we should be just fucking banning sports altogether. This is a joke, but like... I fucking hate competitive sports. Why does it matter? We don't go mad over ""best blue cheese"" competitions, why can't we be more like blue cheese? ""Sports integrity"" stuff annoys me to no end because I genuinely *do not care*, it is the most unimportant issue in the whole of the Milky Way galaxy and half of Andromeda. Someone's always gonna be ""the best"", and that we are making it into some competition is beyond me.

Bit of a hot take and probably somewhat fueled by my tiny speck of experience, I just can't with these OOOO SPOORTSSSS people. Not everything has to be an ""us vs them"". I'd gladly choose to never ever hear a thing about sports again if this means these people stop justifying transphobia with it.
They're so obsessed with hating us.
LMFAO @ ‚ÄúDaddy Government‚Äù
I don‚Äôt get why we have to have gender in sports at all. Separation should only be about skill level
They need to show me the studies they are reffering to and I wpuld LOVE to say why these studies can't be taken seriously. Literally the ""n"" is a far too low number, the participants are nowhere near identical (seriously some take trans atlethes and cis people who sometimes do sports and compare them...), the organisation behind it isn't neutral etc.

EVERY study on that matter can't be taken serious.

If we now take a look on what is happening in reality there is NO UNFAIR ADVANTAGE ANYWHERE! Seriously...when a trans woman wins or has a new record (which is nowhere near a world record almost every time except once, which was beaten already) they either were a very good atlethe beforehand (sometimes the number of the place would be lower, but if you look at the number of people doing that sport, the percentage stays the same) and/or are training sometimes even harder than others. Some people were close to records before transitioning as well and lost SO MUCH time etc. by transitioning.

Now the next part: People who are tall have an advantage in basketball, but not every person who is tall is good in basketball or is dominating. Seriously...
There was once a tennis player who had longer arms than usual and actually dominated the sport. No word has been said there about an unfsir advantage.

NEXT next part: People never cared about womens sport and when they would, they would literally REALLY support it instead of fighting trans woman, who have no advantage after 1 year HRT. Like make it more popular, that they don't have to wear almost no clothing, that it's taken more serious, good training gear and places etc. etc.

Next NEXT next point: Let kids have fun? HELLO?! It's not like they are competing for money?!
I don't like that government officials are so down on LGBTQIA  folks. that they spend hours talking about how our children should play sports. But it is also people who voted for these people saying that we are forcing our lifestyle upon them. . . .mhm.
Does Reddit stop counting downvotes at some point? I feel like the downvote count should be higher with how many people upvoted the person you responded to (and just how transphobic most of Reddit can be) lol

If not, you likely got quite a few upvotes to counter the downvotes. So there's that at least. Maybe a few people in cis Reddit have more than 2 braincells to rub together after all lol
r/rimjob_steve
Amazingly these ""can see both sides"" geniuses never get far enough to consider that sports are inherently unfair and boxing and wrestling are the only sports to really do something about it, and for all they're knowledge of science they never look at the statistical evidence that trans women haven't shown a significant advantage over cis women. It's almost like centrists talk out of their fucking asses!
I‚Äôm really tired of these post on this sub. I get it Reddit is transphobic. The world is transphobic. It‚Äôs sucks how much people misunderstand us as people.
If people are really, *really* so concerned with parity among athletes for the sake of competitive advantages, then implement leagues based off of physical tests of ability and ignore anything else. All of the arguments surrounding gender in sports is nothing more than fear of being shown up by someone that some folks want to perceive as lesser.

This absolutely blows my mind, because as a cis guy I'm under no illusions that there aren't a tremendous amount of cis women who could kick my ass at any number of sports! The only way I could ever be competitive and enjoy my time playing is if there was a league exclusively for asthmatic twinks so I wouldn't be the only one having a coughing fit on the field.

Sports have never been ""fair"" in the slightest, and it's incredibly demeaning that people continue this charade that they ever were.
Well I've gone through male puberty I'm 60 years old and I guarantee you a lot of cisgender women most cisgender women are stronger than I am
Could we just abolish gendered teams and organize sports by weight class?
For professionals, sure, have some regulations

For kids though? They‚Äôre kids. Let em play ball
It‚Äôs almost like they hate that you‚Äôre right
Oh, I would've never guess reddit had so many Carers About Women's Sports‚Ñ¢.
Lol yep you hit that nerve at least 100 times good job
It pisses me off so much because if you look at so many successful athletes today they also have curtain things that might make them better at that thing, take Micheal Phelps, he‚Äôs hyper mobile in his shoulders so his arms can move more than his competitors, like if we remove everyone that has something that might increase their skills at something, sports would look totally different today
why are you booing her, she‚Äôs right!
Thats a very libertariany position which is by the way hated by both typical right and left wing people so you're probably not only getting downvotes from people who disagree with your premise but also for your political view
Cishets are a plague üôÉ
Its indeed a conundrum. In America, its important that kids play outside.  This is most important. For excersize and to learn to get along with each other. 

We are too unhealthy a society. If the league plays M&F then its a no brainer. If its is a male league again a no brainer as the best players play period. Well usually. If a F league maybe more thought.  But overall very few players will ever be college level or even pro.  Which means a lot of money is involved and again the best play.  

Another thought is if the player is way to good then maybe play in a male league? If someone is that good then usually the next level up wants them until it balance the competitive level or becomes pro. 

Sports and the military and court system solved the racial divide. Now this too can be worked out. 

Talk wont solve this. Play ball.
the male strong that female arguments is pointless, someone is always faster, or stronger, and most of this is some parent crabbing about the daughter losing to a trans athlete, like they were losing a scholarship or something 

if the trans athlete came in last........... crickets
[removed]
Severely disagree with that guy, I think kids should be educated n brought up to know the reality of their situation n at 16/17 then I'd say they can make an informed choice on their own truly, with as little family n community influence as possible.
I may be missing some context, but it seems you two are talking about two completely different scenarios.  The commenter is talking about post-pubescent competition.  You‚Äôre talking about pre-pubescent competition.  Kids up to a certain age can compete without any inherent advantage from puberty.  When boys hit puberty bone density increases, muscle mass increases, lung capacity increases, etc..  Tons of stuff happens to boys that doesn‚Äôt happen to girls.  Studies on in-shape trans and cis athletes have shown that after 2 years, trans athletes are still able to do 10 percent more push-ups and 6 percent more sit-ups than the cis athletes.  In the same time frame, trans athletes were still able to run 1.5 miles 12 percent faster than cis athletes.  It would take many years for this to be even remotely equal, and even then, trans women will still maintain the same bone density (which can be critically dangerous in contact sports) and heart/lung strength will exceed those in cis athletes.  Obviously if transition is begun BEFORE puberty (which is a completely different topic), advantage whether man or woman, will likely be negligent.  

Again, it seems like you two are arguing two completely different things.  You‚Äôre arguing for kids who have not hit puberty and are transitioning, the other person is arguing for those that have hit puberty before transitioning.
Just make the mainstream (men) open and you solved everything.

I get why different leagues exist, but female, young, etc athletes should have the option to compete in their protected league and the main one.
To be fair, your comment doesn‚Äôt address the issue of fairness at all, and therefore doesn‚Äôt contribute to the discussion.
Was that a discussion of general sports competition, school sports or a specific case of a kid? I don't quite get the point that is being discussed.
In the first case, I think I agree more with the first coment, and I can understand the downvote hate that went towards your comment, comming from that kind of people, but if its any of the 2 other cases I said, then you just entered a transphobic place and that's their way to tell you to run away as far as you can.
I agree with both statements being made
Actually, the studies, since the 90s, done on Olympic athletes, have ruled there is no advantage after ~2 years at 10 or less T iirc. So that guy can fuck off. Also, literally everyone has an unfair advantage in some way for something, nobody is equal, the best athletes are always the ones with an unfair advantage. And trans people have been competing for 30 years without dominating anything, so obviously we don't. It's just misogyny disguised as sympathy, they don't think women are capable, and they don't think we're women, so they think we *are* capable in a way a cis woman somehow can never be

Also yes, this is children, probably a small handful of children, it'll be fucking fine, just let them hang out with their friends. And uh, those puberty blockers they hate would help a ton at erasing this supposed issue
*blinks* i‚Äôm moving to the netherlands
Why should grown adults care about the sports activities of a high school they have no affiliation with? I hate that this is still considered an issue. And it feels extra dehumanizing now that these assholes are proudly attacking trans people in other ways too.
To think about it...

I was 5'3 or 5'4 in my teenage years I was playing football (soccer) in a academy, I was physically weaker than kids my age who are like 5'7 or even up to 5'10 to the point they had to put me with younger kids who match me physically.


Does that mean if I transitioned as a 5'6 AMAB and HRT made me physically weaker as Estrogen + T blockers = Significant muscle mass drop (and probably shrink few inches in height), will that make me prone to physical bullying by bigger and taller ""5'7 - 5'10"" cis girls?
MINUS114?!?
I will never understand why sports are relegated by sex. Why not, idk, weight class? if you wanna relegate it that way?
I blame our commitment to extreme levels of competition at early ages. If a trans person was in a ""fun league"", some dumb cunts would still give a shit even though competition isn't the point of the league.

Our parents spent 18+ years raising us to include everyone and respect the differences between each other. Now, they're mad that we wanna include everyone! Shit makes zero sense...
I don't know why, and I'm only speaking my mind and not criticizing anyone for sharing (because this is the only place I can actually speak my mind and be treated like a human), but this seems to be one of my triggers, the sight of so many people agreeing with something harmful and then downvoting something wholesome, especially when the thing being shit upon was said by and for trans people. I still make myself look at these things, because I can't be scared of words, but it's the feelings and the potential actions behind the words that frighten me so much.

It's like we stand up for ourselves and the rest of the world stands up only to scream, ""Sit down and shut the fuck up"" at us. Recently, I politely asked someone online not to call me ""dude"" and got told over and over by different Redditors that it's a gender neutral term. I didn't even say I wasn't male, just to please not call me that. It's disrespectful.

They're the reason I'm always armed and ready to explode. They have no idea what kind of people they're making us into.
I mean your take is kind of flawed. Nobody is talking about children playing a game on the playground. These are structured, competitive events with very real stakes (since sports is a major pathway for people to be able to afford school). I mean you‚Äôre otherwise correct, but ‚Äújust let the kids figure it out‚Äù isn‚Äôt really a solution because they aren‚Äôt choosing who they play any more than a professional athlete does.
What happened to ‚Äúmen and women are equally strong‚Äù? Don‚Äôt hear the TERFs saying that anymore
Mainline reddit is so transphobic it would be comical in other circumstances
Why is the government regulating kids sports? I mean it seems overstepping by several miles.
as a transfem athlete i fully agree with your comment. i am still comfortable competing as a U18 boy on my sport of bowling. granted, many of the local tournaments are broken into divisions based on skill and not gender, but national scale contests i am registered as a male and, while checking that box makes me a bit dysphoric, i still feel more comfortable there than if i were in a female division. i‚Äôm a girl that is comfortable competing in the boys divisions, and i think that people should decide which division they want to compete in based off of nothing more than where they are comfortable. hell, we need to get rid of the gender barrier entirely, or at least through high school level sports.
Man shits not even hard we just start using skill brackets. Boom problem solved.
professional sports should be balanced tbh, but also, how many fucking trans atheletes are even there? Bro y'all banning a total of twenty people, just ignore the issue or something. Plus genetic mutations also give unfair advantages, so you're gonna ban cis women with natural advantages as well or what?
The ignorance is unreal. Say anything about sport and you basically have to delete your account and go into witness protection.
remember one of the only factors on where trans woman score higher then cis woman is grip strenght
Wow the ""small government supporters"" downvote someone talking about a small government
""no kid of mine shall have fun game with another kid of a different gender""
Cause Reddit is full of individual echo chambers. I am amazed how often I get downvoted for simple and not even controversial statements. Essentially if I say anything, and I mean anything, even slightly not the main talking point on the reddit, I will get downvoted and rhe only way to get upvoted a lot is make the same exact point or present the same idea eevryone else have. Reddit seems to be made for creating weird tribalist mindsets. I don‚Äôt even think you need to touch a nerve, just say something they even slightly disagree with. I said rhe other day I‚Äôd like to re-sign a certain player to my sports team, apparantly that was unpopular with that particular reddit group even though in other places it is a common take. Downvoted to hell.
Simple solution. Have 2 brackets. One for allies and 1 for homophobes. The one for allies has trans people and cis people. The one for homophobes is just that, plus in teack/marathons we have a lion chasing them, it'll push them to go as fast as possible
In the netherlands for amateur handball the rule is that you can play with mixed teams in a match if both teams agree to it. Usually they do
I think we need to start linking the posts. Trans takeover in the fucking comments
""party of small government"" MFs when someone provides a practical solution to government intervention on a certain contentious topic (they don't actually believe in small government anymore, they just want to hate people and will use the government as an excuse to do that)
And of course most of these bans involve high school sports, and if they would stop getting out of the way, a lot of these trans kids could avoid ""male puberty"" all together. 

The point is exclusion. The point is cruelty. They hate us and want us to be forced to stay in the closet because we make them uncomfortable.
We can't have unfair advantages in a thing that is all about unfair advantages!
Why do people downvote actually good coments/post down so much. Like wtf.
It wasn't even about competitive
Side note i don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a one rule for all possibility
Which arrows do I press? I am so confused. XD
I think of these laws as insults. Not just to trans people but to sports teams and leagues. Y'all really think they are so incompetent that the government has to spend taxpayer dollars to legislate rules when the leagues are perfectly capable of coming up with their own rules? Rules that are informed by actual medical research rather than politician opinions...
Why did he get so many down votes? He raises a good point it shouldent matter.
It's almost like they never cared about the kids in the first place
The average mildly transphobic Redditor thrives on the idea that this transgender stuff is just too complicated.  Makes them feel smart for having an opinion and wise for not actually doing anything.

My usual go to is equally simple and agreeable and it also gets down voted: the point of school sports is to keep kids healthy, off drugs, and making friends.  How does banning trans kids contribute to any of those goals?
No, they're defensively ignorant
Sometimes you'll even get downvoted for saying the definition of a word, it's weird. On another account I got ~100 downvotes for saying the definition of a TERF. Neutrally.
If I think of any of my highschool coaches I would not trust a single one of them to do whats best for a student that deviates from the stock standard athlete stereotype. I would absolutely want someone above them on the hierarchy enforcing that they treat everyone equally or in a fair manner in some way.

Not to mention what do you do if one team is okay with a trans athlete and another team in the same league and region isn't? There's got to be an overarching decision made here on how to handle these issues, leaving it to teams to handle themselves just feels like a terrible idea all around. I'm not seeing any upsides to this posts opinion and I'm reaaaally not seeing it being a favorable setup for trans kids in this current climate.

And have you heard of Semolina Castor? Trying to take her olpymic win away because she /naturally/ has more testosterone than other women.

Michael Phelps? You mean the CHEATING genetic FREAK that DESTROYED men's swimming?
But think of the parents living vicariously through their kids! They‚Äôll never be able to live their dreams through their kid!
And their ""scientific studies"" are bullshit anyways. There are already studies regarding transgender athletes and trans women, once on HRT for enough time, perform close to cis women, or worse.

It's even been observed with Lia Thomas and her ""unbeatable"" records that got beaten recently as well as losing recently, but that's not news for them since they just want fuel for polarizing this issue.
> people don't place bets on high school football games.

I see you're not from Texas.
I played sports in middle and high school and I can assure you I‚Äôve never fit the definition of ‚Äúathlete‚Äù, it‚Äôs not like every athlete on that field was equally good, some guys who barely ever practiced were wildly above the skill and strength level of other people on my team. Sports in middle and high school aren‚Äôt very fair to begin with
Oh they already do that. Cis girl with too much t? Banned unless she takes t blockers. Intersex? Have to compete with men. Chromosomal sex disorder? Better get thorough testing to make sure there‚Äôs no unfair advantage. Have to keep those cis girls protected from unfairness.
Going through HRT is literally eroding my bones and muscle mass (and my doctor told me this would happen) there is absolutely no advantage to cis women if u are taking estrogen. I meet dozens of cis women that are stronger than me and more athletic every day
But let's face it: the Olympics is still just for fun. They're not solving any real world problems except the need to entertain people.
Sport is all about advantages. That being said, there are a few protected advantages. Namely age, sex, and disability. Kids, females, and the disabled all struggle to win against adults, males, and able bodied people respectively in many sports. So they each have their protected leagues, so they can still win. 

You mention banning athletes with advantages. At least most people I have seen, that isn‚Äôt the goal. It‚Äôs just to keep the protected leagues protected. People with advantages can still play in the general, non protected leagues. If you are concerned about people in the general leagues having advantages, then we should make more protected leagues. I‚Äôm not sure what advantages you have in mind to separate though.

Now if you think advantages aren‚Äôt an issue, then that would mean we should get rid of the protected leagues and just force everyone to play together. Athletes in those leagues are definitely not a fan of that proposal though.

Also idk what high school you went to, but a lot of high schools it is more than just ‚Äúfun and exercise‚Äù, they get extremely competitive. Just because you or I don‚Äôt care as much about the sports doesn‚Äôt mean people should be allowed to do whatever they want.
The thing is, this reductive argument means that inherently, the argument even if we win it still leaves open the fight against college and Olympic level athletes. Yes, it's shite, but it will happen.

So we need to kill this outright. The fact is that this argument is pretty universally blown apart by medicine. The catch is something where, say, height gives an advantage or something, but to be honest, that just means that you're still leaving open to cis athletes who are above that height, and you know they won't have a problem with them.
Conservatives don't conserve anything, they circumvent.
Nono, you see, big government is if they regulate something **I** am doing. If the government doesn't disctiminate against trans people, they are going to impact **my** abbility to feel smug about being an ass to them, or even outlaw harrassing them, and if you think about it, isn't that a form of big government?
Or let those trans kids start HRT around the time their puberty would start, therefore eliminating any potential advantage they would have and alleviate them of discomfort. Oh, against that too huh?
My favorite thing is when you adjust for height and weight, the difference goes away. Trans women on average have an advantage over cis women because they are taller on average.
Heres an interesting [article from The Atlantic](https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2012/08/the-golden-ratio-the-one-number-that-describes-how-mens-world-records-compare-with-womens/260758/) comparing men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs world records in swimming and running.

Here‚Äôs my takeaway from the article: at the highest level of competition there absolutely is a difference between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs performances, but it‚Äôs not ALL because of physical differences. 

Look, as a former D1 distance runner, it‚Äôs hard not say that men have a physical advantage over women. Running is the most fundamental sport out there, strictly based on physical ability and grit. Men‚Äôs times were consistently better than women‚Äôs by a significant margin, so imo it‚Äôs not fair to ignore the innate biological differences (because women certainly don‚Äôt have less grit). This does not mean I support testosterone testing or any of that other wild invasive shit. Additionally I think this only applies in high level competition scenes, when it come to kids, just let them play for fks sake! Now on the other hand, the whole Leah Thomas thing. Call me a bigot, but yes, I found that to be a bit of an issue. I want everyone to feel included and be able to participate in athletics, sports are awesome, I just don‚Äôt think it is as simple as ‚ÄúI identify as x so I should be able to compete against x‚Äù.

But let me finish. This article highlights a belief I‚Äôve held for a long time - the difference in men & women‚Äôs sports has a significant societal factor. The article highlights how the gap between men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs world records is shrinking, largely in part to the increased promotion/encouragement of women‚Äôs sports. ‚Äúthe success of any nation's elite athletic program springs from its ability to support, select and train its anomalies.‚Äù Essentially I believe that with equal support, promotion, and access to resources, women can compete at a level much more similar to men, but there is a innate biological advantage in a biological male body.

TLDR: this conversation IS nuanced in regards to adult competition. Men consistently outperform women in fundamental sports like running & swimming, indicating a biological factor, but, societal factors, like the promotion of women‚Äôs sports, also plays a significant role in that performance gap.
Trans men are invisible unfortunately
Ugh they‚Äôll probably just say transmascs are all ‚Äútoo weak‚Äù and ‚Äútoo delicate‚Äù to compete with the cis men too. Look at boxing, they‚Äôll only let trans people box each other.

It's transphobia meets mysogyny. ""Trans people aren't real, and men are superior to women."" ü§Æ
Thank you for this!
> Recent studies show there is no clear advantage, if at all, for trans (mtf) athletes.

wow you mean recycled misogyny is bullshit ? 
i am shocked
The study says there‚Äôs no clear advantage primarily due to a lack of proper studies. It‚Äôs not arguing that there is no advantage, it‚Äôs saying that we can‚Äôt argue that there is one.
Yeah, almost everyone arguing against trans women in women's sports assumes that 100% of people born with a dick are just AUTOMATICALLY 100% stronger, faster, and better than ANY person born with a vagina and always will be.  They think a trans woman will break every bone in a cis woman's body playing volleball or some shit and they completely lack any understanding on what HRT does.  The reality is that many of us trans women are *not* as strong as many cis women.  I play a number of sports and I am not beating up cis women, lol.  I was not even close to the best player on the volleyball team I was playing on, but morons just completely ignore this and assume that all trans women are testosterone fueled monsters.

Oh, and it's almost certainly always cis and straight men claiming trans women can't play sports (and legislating our rights away) in an effort to pRoTeCt WoMeN bEcAuSe ThEyRe WeAk.  Not only is it transphobic, but it's also sexist to assume that cis women ""need"" the protection these chuds are 'offering'.  I wish they would shut the fuck up and let us women resolve it (in the case of trans women in women's sports, trans men in men's sports is would obviously have male voices involved).

Not to mention this ENTIRE SUBJECT is built upon the *false* notion that trans women are dominating high end sports (even Lea Thomas wasn't dominating, she won like a couple of events and lost a bunch more), and these chuds are using that to then take rights away from ALL of us, when most of us that want to play sports just want to play sports in school or locally.
That‚Äôs an ‚Äúexpert opinion,‚Äù not a study.  Studies have shown that some ‚Äúadvantages‚Äù that a male-at-birth holds are irreversible after puberty, while others take many many years to reverse.
Happy cake day!üéÇ
For one, WWE is scripted.  And two, you did not train to be in WWE.  You‚Äôre comparing yourself, who has never ‚Äúwrestled‚Äù WWE a day in your life, vs people who make millions off of it for being popular
This is one of the very few ‚Äúconservative‚Äù stances I have but there really is an advantage to being a cis man when it comes to some sports. For example I ran track and field in high school. If I competed as a trans woman without taking hormones, I would‚Äôve been one of, if not the fastest women in the history of the sport. Instead I wasn‚Äôt even the fastest in my high school. You could say it‚Äôs because there‚Äôs less girls running track and field, but in my school there were more people on the girls team than the boys.

Edit: it might be better to say that I believe having high levels of testosterone is an advantage not being a cis male
(cis) men are genetically stronger than (cis) women. Sure some women will be stronger and more athletic than many men but, on average, (cis) men are stronger. 

The reason people stress about trans people in female leagues is because of the advantage trans women have over cis women. 

I complexity agree that that female sports should have batter acres to funding and facilities, but that has nothing to do with why people ‚Äústress about the trans community in sports‚Äù.
[removed]
So like divisions based on skill? That would kinda suck for women though. For sports like track and swimming where testosterone just puts you on another level, literally all people with low T would be in low classes where people would presumably not be very interested in watching. I mean sadly people aren‚Äôt interested in women‚Äôs sports as it is. But it sounds cooler to say you‚Äôre the women‚Äôs champ then the division 8 champ or whatever it would be.
[removed]
Government small enough to fit in your underwear or crawl into your ear.
She wasn't even good enough to be an Olympic swimmer, she was decent-to-good in the NCAA. (Obviously a huge achievement and she should be very proud, just wanted to emphasize that she wasn't a prodigy or anything.) Cis Olympic swimmers would wipe the floor (skim the pool?) with her.
Right?  Like boxing or wrestling (I think, at high school level anyway) do.  That's why I'm confused by that specific argument:  there are various non-transphobic solutions that would adequately solve that potential issue (even like that original response of ""hey maybe let the actual organizations sort that out instead of laws?"").

Of course it's never about the argument... Hating trans people is an attempt to stay relevant to conservatives by appealing to hatred of ""things they don't understand but are asked to accept"" and they don't wanna...
I don‚Äôt think sorting sports by weight or height is sufficient. There are good reasons for having categories such as age, gender, or disabilities in sports. If not young able bodied men would would win at every weight and height class. It would marginalize groups, such as women or the disabled,  who are already sidelined in sports.

Depends on the subreddit tbh
Well, I‚Äôm a trans woman and I was in a lesbian subreddit which aparently was transphobic (I had no idea cuz the 2 ‚Äúmain‚Äù lesbian subreddits I use ain‚Äôt transphobic, just commenting there did the same to my comments, straight down to -50 atleast with every post (cuz my account clearly says I‚Äôm a trans woman)
Testosterone is not the determining factor on whether or not one has an advantage.
Litterally This, except the voice part from what I‚Äôve heared, voice stays low(I think?)
I don't think its all that libertarian to think the government has better things to do than make the rules for a game
Please list all of the professional trans athletes who have completely dominated a sport to the alarming extent that no cis woman could ever hope to challenge the record.

Keep in mind that trans folks have been allowed to compete at the highest level for over a decade at this point.
Show me the study and I will tell you why that study can't be taken serious. Most of the time it's the ""n"" which isn't even over 40.

Edit: I can't answer your comment the link is in because reddit doesn't show me, so I'll do it here and edit my comment later:

29 trans men and 46 trans women....compared to EVERYONE under 30...you see the flaw here? The n is too small...again...and they were even smaller on some tests, because some didn't even attempt that.

The age: We don't know the average age of the cis group, where fun fact: Also trans people could have been involved, because it was a statistic about EVERYONE from the time 2004 and 2014.

Also other factors weren't taken serious like height etc. so being tall could be the advantage instead or disadvantage in some places, instead of being trabsgender or cisgender. Also like I said: trans people could already be in the numbers they compare it on, since they didn't take them thenselves. They are allowed since the year 2000 so it's not only possible, the chances are very high.
Also the different backgrounds weren't taken serious. Some people did lots of sports before they went to the army, some didn't.

I don't need to take a deeper look inside, that's already enough to say that that study is crap and can't be taken serious, because the groups are neither really comparable, the ""n"" is far too low and they compare trans people with cis and trans people?!

Edit 2: Since I can't answer you AGAIN, I will edit my comments later again:

Seriously yes you can't have a good ""n"" value, that's true. But you can take a look into reality and see that no trans woman is dominating anything or has an unfair advantage. According to that study we would have much more trans women who would be excellent at sprint even dominating naybe, but we don't.

Saying that there are ""so many studies saying there is an advantage"" while the groups cant be compared is like saying ""There are many studies saying that atlethes have an advantage to people doing sport sometimes"". You can't compare these groups. Also ""in my study with n=10 you can see that 10% of people are trans, because one was trans""...you can't take such low numbers serious.



Also studies saying that there is no evidence of an unfair advantage:
 https://www.thepinknews.com/2023/01/26/trans-women-no-unfair-advantage-elite-sport-new-report-finds/

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5357259/

Comment from an expert on that matter saying there is no unair advantage: https://www.aclu.org/legal-document/hecox-v-little-safer-declaration

Another comment with an expert: https://cosmosmagazine.com/people/transgender-women-in-sport/

https://www.smh.com.au/national/let-evidence-not-fear-drive-policies-on-trans-athletes-20220423-p5afm1.html

and there is more....


Seriously there are no studies you can take serious as evidence that there is an advantage. Because of that we have to take a look at the reality. The reality says there is no unfair advantage. It's that easy.

Edit 3: Same thing, different comment:

If ""evidence"" (you should say studies and I will use it like that, because the evidence literally shows that. You know, reality?) would say there is no advantage or disadvantage but the ""n"" would be too low or let me add: they are not comparable, YES that study can't be taken serious as well. There was a study who said that trans women would have a disadvantage against cis women (couldn't find it that fast) but I know that you couldn't take it serious as well, so I didn't bother to continue to search it. Just so you know that this even exists....

When the study is a serious study where the things being compared and the ""n"" is reasonable, then you can take it serious. Then you can also take some other studies more serious with less ""n"", but you should still be very careful about the numbers.

If there are many studies with a low ""n"" like 50 BUT the things which get compared CAN actually be compared, were well done and the results are almost identical, then you could take it more serious as well.

That doesn't happen with the studies about sport tho, because you cant compare 100.000 people with 40...or 30... Seriously when I take 40 people and one of them is trans, then 2,5% of all people would be trans. If I take 40 people and 12 of them are women, you don't have the world population of women which would be 30%. 

You also cant compare someone who did sport their whole life and multiple days a week with someone who didn't or does it once a week. These studies do exactly that all the time. Also the height difference etc. is almost never taken serious just like many other factors. Muscle mass on taller people are different to people who are smaller. All these things can be read in the links I send you, where I'm sure you didn't even read one of them.

Edit 4: You know how that works and Reddit:

It's not only the ""n"" mate, that's what I'm trying to tell you bit you don't get it. YOU CAN'T COMPARE SOMEONE WHO DID SPORT FOR A YEAR WITH SOMEONE WHO DID IT THEIR WHOLE LIFE...the study you showed LITERALLY also has trans men and women in the cis men and women group and that was a whole different time than when the trans people were tested. The study has so much flaws and can't be taken serious by it.

YES HEIGHT CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE that's why most people at basketball are tall. BUT you aren't automatically good at basketball only because you are tall. Also maybe I forgot to give you another source but over 70% of female atlethes say that trans women don't have an advantage, so YES EVEN MOST ATLETHES SAY THAT. You argue on things which are just not the real world but made up in your mind. And why do most athletes say that? Because the advantages like height is  something cis women can also have and trans women can also be small. Also you need a lot of training, these things don't make you automatically better. ALSO in rugby for example being tall has advantages AND disadvantages, that's also a reason.

Seriously read it and stop claiming crap: https://cosmosmagazine.com/people/transgender-women-in-sport/

https://bridges.monash.edu/articles/report/Evaluating_LGBTI_Inclusion_within_Sport_and_the_Pride_Cup_Initiative/12731810

Also they said that noone ever compared cis and trans women with the same height like that and with the muscle mass, since when you are taller that works a bit different. They said that but you choose to ignore it.
I can't answer your comment the link is in because reddit doesn't show me, so I'll do it here and edit my comment later:

29 trans men and 46 trans women....compared to EVERYONE under 30...you see the flaw here? The n is too small...again...and they were even smaller on some tests, because some didn't even attempt that.

The age: We don't know the average age of the cis group, where fun fact: Also trans people could have been involved, because it was a statistic about EVERYONE from the time 2004 and 2014.

Also other factors weren't taken serious like height etc. so being tall could be the advantage instead or disadvantage in some places, instead of being trabsgender or cisgender. Also like I said: trans people could already be in the numbers they compare it on, since they didn't take them thenselves. They are allowed since the year 2000 so it's not only possible, the chances are very high.
Also the different backgrounds weren't taken serious. Some people did lots of sports before they went to the army, some didn't.

I don't need to take a deeper look inside, that's already enough to say that that study is crap and can't be taken serious, because the groups are neither really comparable, the ""n"" is far too low and they compare trans people with cis and trans people?!

Edit: Since I can't answer you AGAIN, I will edit my comments later again:

Seriously yes you can't have a good ""n"" value, that's true. But you can take a look into reality and see that no trans woman is dominating anything or has an unfair advantage. According to that study we would have much more trans women who would be excellent at sprint even dominating naybe, but we don't.

Saying that there are ""so many studies saying there is an advantage"" while the groups cant be compared is like saying ""There are many studies saying that atlethes have an advantage to people doing sport sometimes"". You can't compare these groups. Also ""in my study with n=10 you can see that 10% of people are trans, because one was trans""...you can't take such low numbers serious.



Also studies saying that there is no evidence of an unfair advantage:

Seriously there are no studies you can take serious as evidence that there is an advantage. Because of that we have to take a look at the reality. The reality says there is no unfair advantage. It's that easy.

Edit 2: Same thing, different comment:

If ""evidence"" (you should say studies and I will use it like that, because the evidence literally shows that. You know, reality?) would say there is no advantage or disadvantage but the ""n"" would be too low or let me add: they are not comparable, YES that study can't be taken serious as well. There was a study who said that trans women would have a disadvantage against cis women (couldn't find it that fast) but I know that you couldn't take it serious as well, so I didn't bother to continue to search it. Just so you know that this even exists....

When the study is a serious study where the things being compared and the ""n"" is reasonable, then you can take it serious. Then you can also take some other studies more serious with less ""n"", but you should still be very careful about the numbers.

If there are many studies with a low ""n"" like 50 BUT the things which get compared CAN actually be compared, were well done and the results are almost identical, then you could take it more serious as well.

That doesn't happen with the studies about sport tho, because you cant compare 100.000 people with 40...or 30... Seriously when I take 40 people and one of them is trans, then 2,5% of all people would be trans. If I take 40 people and 12 of them are women, you don't have the world population of women which would be 30%. 

You also cant compare someone who did sport their whole life and multiple days a week with someone who didn't or does it once a week. These studies do exactly that all the time. Also the height difference etc. is almost never taken serious just like many other factors. Muscle mass on taller people are different to people who are smaller. All these things can be read in the links I send you, where I'm sure you didn't even read one of them.

Edit 3: You know how that works and Reddit:

It's not only the ""n"" mate, that's what I'm trying to tell you bit you don't get it. YOU CAN'T COMPARE SOMEONE WHO DID SPORT FOR A YEAR WITH SOMEONE WHO DID IT THEIR WHOLE LIFE...the study you showed LITERALLY also has trans men and women in the cis men and women group and that was a whole different time than when the trans people were tested. The study has so much flaws and can't be taken serious by it.

YES HEIGHT CAN BE AN ADVANTAGE that's why most people at basketball are tall. BUT you aren't automatically good at basketball only because you are tall.

Edit: Again I will edit later:

You don't know shit and come to conclusions which are just dump. You really believe what some people say without proper research...damn...do your own proper research next time please...

First of all: When someone would have qualified for the olympics and transitions then, ofc they would be still in the olympics after they would be allowed to compete with their gender.

If someone trained to go there but would never have made it, then they wouldn't even after transitioning, the only exception maybe: There aren't enough competitors in the first place in that sport.

And because you STILL don't understand it: There. is. no. unfair. advantage.
The body in some fields could be an advantage, yes but cis women especially in olympics have a body like that as well. That's what you don't get.

About powerlifting: She never broke a world record, in fact even her best attempts were not that near of it. With her best ever attempts she would have been 2nd place at the olympics nowhere near the world record which got broken there as well, but she was at the last place. She broke records for the places she was in and not even by much. That's right.

To Lia Tjomas I will copy and paste another comment since I don't have enough nerves to explain someone everything ober and ober again, just because you wanna believe in made up crap: 

Lia thomas was a top ranked US mens swimmer before she started HRT. She then dropped by several hundred positions in the rankings whem she started HRT. When she was allowed to switch divisions, she was a top ranked US womens swimmer.
Muscle mass atrophies on HRT, and trans women have to train harder than cis women to build or maintain muscle, as cis women actually have higher T levels. 

Lia Thomas may be a bit more muscular than the average cis woman but she proabably puts in about 1.2-1.4x the effort to maintain that than the average cis woman.  And according to her competitors she actually did exactly that.

A lot of people have talked about trans womans advantages in sport but if you actually look into the effects of HRT then you'll see that the only advantage you could potentially see is height, which to be honest more often than not gets balanced out by disadvantages that come with HRT. Height is also not always there and can be a disadvantge as well.

Also, Lia Thomas took adequate time before joining the womens division to ensure that her HRT had worked properly. 

She lost LOTS of time on every category, broke the record by almost nothing (she also almost did that while she competed against men with their times) and the same day in different categories she placed a lot lower in other categories. According to you she must have won there as well, but she didn't.

Lia Thomas is an outlier anyway, there are loads of trans women who compete in womens sports who are ranked super low in their respective sports, and nobody bats an eye.

It's not about the advantage anyway, its about who's allowed to win. Let me explain;

When black men were first allowed to compete in competetive sports in the US, specifically snprints, the primary argument against allowing black people to compete was that those of african heritage were had a biological advantage and were faster than white people, and that should mean it would be unfair. This was, you guessed it, thinley veiled racism. 

When the womens sharpshooting was introduced to the Olympics, there wasn't a major issue. Until a particular athlete, I believe the one from China, started performing far too well. Not cheating, of course, just extremely skilled. Some of the mens division players and their staff still called for her removal.

Now lets look at the other side of the story. Michael Phelps is the most decorated Olympian we have on record, with 23 gold medals in mens swimming. He has a very unusual wingspan, and large hands. His body also produces a lot less lactic acid than others. These are ACTUAL biological advantages. Phelps doesn't have to take medicine to fix his lactic acid production though, or wear equipment that reduces the advantage from his wingspan. Why aren't people upset about it? Because he's white and a dude.

Thank you for coming to my TED talk.

Edit: And again since you don't get it or don't wanna get it: YOU DON'T HAVE SCIENTIFIC PROOF. Don't be so stubborn. It's like saying I have scientific proof that 4 in 10 people are trans because my friend group is like that. We competed in sports, even tho someone wasn't there and only 3 people do sports on a regular basis. We found out that the one who did it on a regular basis have an unfair advantage, we should ban doing sport on a regular basis. That's literally what your studies were doing. 

Your conclusion on that studies were therefore not only not based on evidence and science but made up.
Also you didn't even do right research about the people you put your conclusion onto. You believe what someone said and other repeated a lot of times, even when it's just half of the story. There is much more behind it and literally some things you thought happening there were blatantly wrong.

THAT indeed makes you look like you don't have a clue since your evidence is either no evidence and that has been proven by studies I showed you or is false information you somehow read up.
If that is really all you can do, I wouldn't start an argument or tell crap about such a complicated topic which is used to strip trans people of rights like in the USA, where there is literally the start of a genocide happening (let's hope it doesn't happen completly).

I repeated myself again and again and again and you didn't WANT to understand it or you didn't read it or didn't want to read it. That's what I said. Seriously if you can't read what I wrote or didn't wanna read and understand it and the science behind it, that's on you. Yes you put me into a position I always had to repeat myself ofc I get frustrated with you. You really don't know anything about the topic except the very surface and make conclusion based on that. THAT IS indeed not knowing shit for me.

It's like I'm saying I know all about chemistry, when in fact I don't know shit there.

Seriously try to learn what is really happening in the real world and try to think more critically and do proper research. Like seriously you told me things and I had evidence that you are wrong. For example you said that athlethes would say that trans women have an advantage when in fact more than 70% of cis female atlethes say they don't. 

EVEN THE PEOPLE YOU TRY TO DEFEND AREN'T ON YOUR SIDE, because what you said is simply not true.

Let them know we stand together and are tired of this bullshit.
The issue is they care more about the ""integrity"" of their sport than they do about the kids.

 Sportball is more important than children don't you know that!? /s
Truth
Nor sports. No where itn the conversation the building of teamwork and sportsmanship.

Just pearl clutching that a ""neutral person"" might be at a disadvantage against one of the weirdos, and we can't have that.
Or about small government.
> The average mildly transphobic Redditor thrives on the idea that this transgender stuff is just too complicated. Makes them feel smart for having an opinion and wise for not actually doing anything.

You know, I agree - but I always find it pretty fucking wild when ""this thing is too complicated for me"" is a premise and the conclusion is ""therefor I'm smarter than everyone else"".
It depends on the school or school system. Because some are so highly praised and sought-after that for that momentum to continue, they'd have to be continually recognized and sponsored while proving their pedigree each time.

When money is involved is when people will nit-pick at every and any detail. Including trans-children. So it's no surprise that the bell was rung and everyone at the table is now arguing about this. There surely were sponsor-funded schools who thought it's all unfair. Because after all, why wouldn't we separate the well-off schools from the mediocre ones in separate leagues or groupings? This only support's OP's viewpoint that regardless the competition, if you want to win then you learn how to through strategy and training. Allocating the team's strengths appropriately.

My high school's teams got only local sponsored monetary support. Rest of the money came from fundraising efforts and some from school district budget planning. But despite that, I can't help to feel they also would have rejected transgendered athletes purely on concept alone.
or maybe... just, let the kid play on whichever team they are comfortable on. if they're disadvantaged ability wise, oh well. at least they're happy and included.
this just in!! ""supporting your kids personal decisions makes you a shit parent"". do you hear yourself? no one is saying that they should be able to do whatever the fuck they  want all the time, we're saying that they're still humans, they're still people, they should still be able to make basic decisions for themselves.
And blatantly misgendering her is a popular pastime among a certain type of right-wing nutjob.
>And have you heard of Semolina Castor

Do you mean Caster Semenya by any chance..?
Just a slight correction. Semolina is a grain. I believe you meant Caster Semenya.
Hurting cis people is always the result of trying to gatekeep trans people.. Of course bigots don't really care about that, hurting weirdos is the point - and collateral damage against non-conforming people is always acceptable.
Too much testosterone = not a woman. But trans woman with lower testosterone than most cis woman = not a woman. It's almost like the system is rigged.
Some sports do some sports don't. Some sports even consider weights as an advantage. Basketball should have categories by height like how boxings have weight categories. But who am I to say about professional sports?

So I agree to let sports leagues regulate themselves.
Do you think genders shouldn‚Äôt be separated in sports? As long as they are the distinction between male and female will have to be made. 

Believe it or not there are stakes in athletics, even at the high school level. Scholarships and recruiting to schools is a big stake in high school athletics. If trans women are advantaged is that fair to cis women?
> You won't see them trying to move a 6 foot tall cis girl to the boy's basketball team for being too tall. People aren't mad about NBA players being well above average height, and that it's unfair to all the short people out there who love playing basketball.

I'm going to disclaimer up front that I 100% support trans women playing in women's leagues. That said, I'd imagine the reply to that would be that trans women are statistically more likely to be ~6 ft than AFAB players and out-proportion tall women. Again, I don't think it's a defensible stance because, among other things, I doubt there's enough trans women who want to play to even make a difference in any one league. 

I got into it once with someone on reddit about sports (probably about Lia Thomas) and tried explaining the effects of HRT after years and they started talking about bone density and the angle of people's joints. Frankly, if that's how deep you have to dig to support your argument then your argument is shit, but I've also given up on trying to get into it with these morons so... mission accomplished?
The Infamous Chowder Hound
It was hyperbole. I don't actually think athletes with advantages should be banned from playing, I was just trying to show the logical flaw in the reason they claim to want to ban trans athletes. I do not care enough about sports to have a full or nuanced opinion but I do think it is cruel to force a girl to play on boys' teams because she's ""too masculine"" and vice versa
To be honest I do not have as much of an opinion on banning trans people from professional sports as I do about banning trans people from casual sports teams and banning trans CHILDREN from getting exercise at school. There is a lot more nuance to banning trans people from certain Olympic games than I can possibly understand because frankly I just do not know (or care) much about how professional athleticism works. But banning trans people from non-professional leagues like high school or college where people are just meant to be having fun is stupid
They want to conserve their right to commit human rights violations with impunity
At lest here in germany, the term ""conservatove"" seems to fit them quite nicely. They are resistant to social change (""conserving"" the current state of things) and advocate against going in dept to invest in infrastructure, for example (""conserving"" money). The only thing they aren't conserving is the environment.

But the CDU has started drifting mire right after Merkel. To some extend, this was to be expected since they are now in the opposition, but i wonder if they will start alligning themself with the way american politics seems to work and start heavily relying on transphobia to create outrage and mobilize support.
Or, if a person is 5'3"" and transitions to female and wants to play basketball maybe we can acknowledge that they don't have a massive natural advantage and we should take that into account.

I hate the sentiment of the original post in those two comments because people use language that suggests they're just trying to be nuanced and make practical compromise, but as soon as you point out how, practically speaking, trans people's biology is a very grey area they shut down.

You either accept their implicit stereotype that trans women are all 7ft linebackers who can crush the skulls of cis women with their giant hands, or they won't entertain further discussion.
Lol right this is always my biggest point when talking to someone about it, you can't literally make it impossible for trans people to play sport and then frame it as fairness, because it isn't, you're just forcing people to choose between something they love and their own sanity
Let's not start kids on puberty hormones that early, y'all. Hormone blockers make a lot more sense as a first step.
don't tell them that, what if they realise bio sex isn't just hot dog and roll, what if they realise it's more?!
Bro, do you wanna know something fucking insane? I literally never disputed any of it. Professional sports PERIOD are not fair, never have been, economic and biological factors (even without the inclusion of sex) have always given some people an advantage over others, sometimes to extremes. NOBODY is disputing that evidently most men will have an advantage against most women- what we ARE arguing is that it is not and has never been just as simple as somebody's assigned sex. We are telling you that it is bigoted and it is unjust to ban trans people from sports on the basis of our sex when we can't do anything about it because seeking treatment as a minor is also now illegal! I started testosterone at 15, I am very lucky for this and my experience is not at all a common one, I am aware I could more than likely beat a cis woman at a good chunk of physical sports- especially being a rugby player before I started testosterone. You cannot tell somebody they have to choose between something they love and their own sanity and then try and frame it as fairness- it is not, it never has been.
Also- if you have to continuously try to stress that what you're saying isn't bigoted, even if the person on the other end tells you it is, it is probably bigoted. There is no attempt to make sports fair, the ban on trans people and trans children from participating is not about fairness, it is about alienation.
Honestly invisibility seems better than what the rest of LBTQ+ has to deal with
Ugh. Nightmare world.

I've been on E for all of 9 months and I have trouble lifting the fucking garbage bags at my job now. I tried to casually pick up a case of water to hand to someone and nearly fell over. ""Inherent advantage from male puberty"" my ass üôÑ
They do indeed say that. The NHL sponsored some all-trans tournament (mixed teams, etc) and the TERFs were out in force whining about how the poor wittle transmascs with no more bone density (like, bitches, you *do* realize being on T fixes that issue?) were up against the big scawy transfems.

It was dumb as shit. (And seriously, why are they always on about the goddamn bone density for transmascs? Do they think cis men don't have any? If not, why are they worried about trans women playing against cis women's superior bones???)
I hadn't heard that. Maybe it depends on the sport? I've haven't heard of mix-gender or trans men in american football, for example. 

But the rhetoric is always ""trans people should play with people of their assigned gender at birth"", so I assumed that includes trans men - except that trans men are forgotten about in these discussions.
If you can‚Äôt argue that there is an advantage then the point stands.

Until you can prove there is an advantage then you can‚Äôt claim with impunity that there is an advantage. It‚Äôs an untested hypothesis that‚Äôs being misreport and irrefutable fact.

However, based on the data we have (trans athletes aren‚Äôt smashing cis women‚Äôs records for example) I stand by the position it‚Äôs absolute bs.

Do the research then make the claim. Until then it‚Äôs unfounded speculation and anti trans bs.
Thank you!
[removed]
to my knowledge theres been no reported advantage trans women have over cis women in sports. this is just something people, mostly transphobes, have assumed and taken as fact
Ask yourself: why is that?
Nah i think there are a lot of top athlete women that would make it in higher divisions, and thats ok if they are lower it‚Äôs like wrestling (i think) where there‚Äôs like heavy weight light weight people still watch both just as much
Haven't had a chance to give this a deep dive but at first scan I wouldn't call this study reliable.  She's a competitive runner and therefore has a dog in the fight.  In other words she's biased.  Seems to cherry pick her data to align with her premise that male biological systems cannot be altered by hormone treatment.  She out right states that ""male"" skeletal structure do not change with hormone treatment.  They do.  Bone density changes.  Ligaments change.  Depending how young HT is started there can be changes to bone structure.  She doesn't acknowledge the variance in testosterone levels in AFAB.  She picked the low end of the scale for average testosterone levels.  Many AFAB have much higher levels of testosterone than average.  She doesn't account for age HT was started or if hormone blockers were used early on in puberty.  So, all in all I call it a BS article.  Also, it is a literature review.  Not an actual research case study.
thank you for correcting me!
Yeah it‚Äôs always seemed super obvious to me, maybe I‚Äôm not fully educated on how it all works but yeah it just seems like there‚Äôs so many easy ways to resolve the ‚Äòissues‚Äô, I don‚Äôt like calling it an issue because it shouldn‚Äôt be one.

And yeah it‚Äôs always deflection. I can say it is 100% here in the UK, our government have failed our country and are destroying it for profit for them and their friends that own big businesses. Instead of discussing the real issues we constantly have crap about trans people ruining everything or immigrants. 

I just hate that these countries are so obviously lying and hiding things from people and using scapegoats yet people don‚Äôt see what‚Äôs right in front of them.
That‚Äôs true but it wouldn‚Äôt have men going up against women, I was talking about those categories within the gendered sports, so still have a woman‚Äôs category but split them by weight and height and maybe some other factors I‚Äôm not thinking of. Obviously there needs to be a limit so there isn‚Äôt hundreds of categories. But even trans women have a disadvantage when competing against cis men.
That may be true but after taking hormones it affects the muscle balance through someone‚Äôs body and will affect this greatly. They wouldn‚Äôt just let someone compete without starting HRT. I really don‚Äôt think the difference after this is done is that great, not like what people would make you believe anyway.
You're absolutely right, but it usually has a negative vibe to it no matter where you go.
Oh no, you committed the unforgivable crime that is, *existing* üò≥
You're right! It's one of many, and just so happens to be the most influential as well.
Yeah, vocal chords dont recover from male puberty
Typically calling government ""daddy"" is a very libertarian thing to say because libertarians believe in individual freedom above all, as in most political positions there's a spectrum to things it isn't an all or nothing deal. Then again if you ask some of the most polarized (either end) people you know if government should intervene in such matters you'll probably get a resounding yes and thats because then are either authoritarian or lean authoritarian, there's nothing inherently wrong with having an authoritarian political view even if i personally disagree with it. All has to be taken with a grain of salt, i've been in politics in the past (not US but know it well) and met a lot of people, the only ones i've seen calling daddy government are liberatarians at heart, they oppose general government intervention in most parts of life. That's the whole why i said ""very libertariany position"". Big cheers
Sorry, not going to play that game.  

Just as banning performance enhancing drugs is not about    "" completely dominated a sport "" banning post puberty MF athletes is not either.  It's about an unfair advantage.
https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1252764 this is the link to the news article I cited my statistics on, and it provides a link to the organization that conducted the study (British Journal of Sports Medicine).  I‚Äôd love for you to ‚Äútell me why I‚Äôm wrong‚Äù so I can simple ignore your reply since you clearly are on one side of the argument, unwilling to adjust your stance in the slightest, despite literal scientific facts given by one of the largest, credible sports medicine journals in the world.
I understand that, but you‚Äôre completely missing my point.  A trans woman that has been working out for a year will not be competing with olympians.  So there is no need to worry about any advantage, because she will simply not be anywhere near the same level, and starting that training later in life means that she will also likely never catch up with the women that have been training their entire life.  On the contrary, if a trans woman went through puberty as a man training for the Olympics for their entire life, is good enough to compete in even the men‚Äôs Olympics, then transitions and now competes as a woman in the women‚Äôs Olympics, this will give her an advantage.  This is because some VERY major development that took place naturally because of testosterone is irreversible.  She will still have those ‚Äúmale‚Äù features that provide an advantage, and she will be able to utilize them to outperform the competition.  I am talking about competition, not intramural sports where nobody gives a damn who is playing or how they‚Äôre doing.  The Olympics requires a lot more than just skill, just as it requires a lot more than just physiological advantages.  They go hand in hand.  If you don‚Äôt have one or the other, you will VERY likely not perform well relative to your competition, who has both.  I do not care if you try out for the Olympics, because unless you were an Olympian previously, you likely wouldn‚Äôt qualify whether you transitioned or not.  However, if you WERE an Olympian and you decide to try out for the women‚Äôs Olympics, you will excel, because the standard for men‚Äôs Olympics is much higher than women‚Äôs.  You won‚Äôt lose any skill by transitioning, and you won‚Äôt lose much of the physiological advantage that you have from before transitioning.  Estrogen on its own will not inhibit your athletic performance so greatly that you will now be equal with cis women.  Mary Gregory is a perfect example.  She was an incredibly strong, successful powerlifter before transitioning, but was not breaking world records.  After transitioning, she broke multiple world records in WOMENS powerlifting, as well as taking home the gold in all 9 power lifting events she competed in.  Lia Thomas is another one.  She swam the 200m freestyle and broke the Ivy League record in her first meet.  She ranked 554th in the mens 200m before transitioning.  It just doesn‚Äôt make any sense that the reason these two specific athletes excelled other than a physiological advantage.  It‚Äôs not because she grew up with more money or had better access to facilities, it‚Äôs because she hit puberty as a male athlete and transitioned after her masculine structure had already developed.  

To reiterate, I am not talking about little intramural leagues or kids co-op, I‚Äôm talking about competitive sports such as the NCAA, FIFA, Olympics, probably high school, and whatever other professional league/intermediate league you can think of.  These are athletes that train to excel in their sport, not some Jane doe that‚Äôs touched a basketball once in her life and wants to start playing intramural to get better.
The n will ALWAYS be too low, because such a large percentage of the population is cis!  You‚Äôll never be able to take a proper proportion of cis vs trans people, because the trans population is less the 1 percent of the total population (in the US).  However, out of all the credible studies that HAVE been done, none have suggested that there is no advantage to trans woman athletes or no disadvantage to trans man athletes.  Whether or not the ‚Äún‚Äù is too low, there are no studies to suggest anything different, so how can you just assume that there is no advantage?  When the only credible studies suggest that there IS an athletic advantage to trans woman and there IS an athletic disadvantage to trans men.  To deny credible studies while presenting no credible evidence to support your own claims is absurd and it‚Äôs hard to even have this discussion.
Firstly, if evidence supported the idea that transgender people held no advantage nor disadvantage, would you still be making the claim that ‚Äún‚Äù is not large enough to validate any of the ‚Äúevidence‚Äù?
I believe in this context, evidence is just as concise.  I‚Äôve provided evidence, but your counterargument is that ‚Äún‚Äù isn‚Äôt large enough.  And if the evidence WERE in favor of your argument, you would still be claiming that the ‚Äún‚Äù is still too small.  However, most of the sources you have are that trans athletes have no advantage nor disadvantage to cis athletes.  A few had said there is ‚Äúno clear advantage,‚Äù but they were all ‚Äúexpert opinions.‚Äù  I‚Äôm sure these experts have no athletic experience, considering many of them tried to claim that height, bone density, and muscle mass have no real advantage in sports.  In MOST sports, height is an advantage, bone density allows for a larger frame, which again, is an advantage in most sports, and muscle is the sole reason athletes work out.  If muscle mass weren‚Äôt a factor in sports, it wouldn‚Äôt be so crucial for athletes to build their bodies to conform to the sports they‚Äôre playing.  Every single expert had claimed that these have no advantage in sports, but ask any athlete and they‚Äôll tell you different.

Now going off that data, showing that these factors are generally unaffected by HRT in Trans woman athletes, this would provide an advantage, despite your denial of the performance evaluations.
No need to edit.  I‚Äôm don‚Äôt with this conversation since you can no longer stick to a civilized discussion and refrain from insults on my intelligence.  Research is reading scientific articles from reputable sources and collecting information based on what they give.  That‚Äôs what I did, so if you can‚Äôt see that then there‚Äôs nothing that furthering this discussion will accomplish.
Most people who argue about that don't even care about sports. Most who want to ""protect women's sports"" probably haven't seen more than 5 female matches in all their lives... It's about transphobia where ""trans woman are actually men"" but they don't even care to do the research, only to spread their transphobic views (weather they realize it's transphobic or not)
Sports are inherently unfair to begin with, people tend to be born different (size of body parts, hormone levels). So the integrity is already questionable if the goal is to make a cleanly even playing field.

Note: not disregard the amount of effort training takes and etc. Just pointing out the natural advantages that people are born with have an impact. üíñ
Shouldn't it also be about the other kids? If a woman or girl is literally demolishing every single other person and her advantage stems not just from being a talented athlete but from a genetic predisposition to testosterone to the level of men, should all the other women's sports careers suffer for the sake of ""just let them be who they are?""

It is not as simple of a situation as ""just let them play"" unfortunately, though I wish it was.

Imagine being a woman and training all your life and being #1 across the board and then someone comes in with an unfair advantage and demolishes you.
Their post doesn't say leave it to the kid. Their post says leave it to the teams. 

That will absolutely not give every kid a fair chance to be a part of the team they want to be on. Plenty of teams would reject a trans team member from joining unless some policy from higher up said otherwise. 

I'm surprised everyone would want this to be unregulated and that you'd think the average coach and students would be understanding/accommodating of a trans individual, I am not that optimistic.
Yes! I read about it like 3 years ago. My bad
Obviously they are talking about the Italian twin lost at birth
[deleted]
I see what you are trying to say since I‚Äôve seen a lot of people say the same thing, but it isn‚Äôt a logical flaw. Sex (along with age and disability) are widely agreed to be worthy of protection. I‚Äôm not aware of other advantages that people want to separate. People are simply advocating to continue with the statue quo.

As a reminder, unlike a lot of things, sports leagues aren‚Äôt based on gender identity, but actual biological sex. When males were allowed to play, females usually couldn‚Äôt beat them, because males are on average stronger in a lot of ways that are beneficial for athletics. Now if it‚Äôs just a casual thing, that‚Äôs not a big deal, but if it‚Äôs a competitive league, leagues will always just pack their team with biological males. So the solution was to make leagues biological males are not allowed to join. [(Except for some sports with set numbers of each sex, and a few where sex doesn‚Äôt really matter)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixed-sex_sports). The other league often isn‚Äôt a men‚Äôs league, but a general league. And high schools absolutely are competitive, so this is relevant to them.

‚Äúforce a girl to play on boys' teams because she's ‚Äòtoo masculine‚Äô ‚Äú is a bit of a disingenuous way to present it. Assuming they haven‚Äôt fully transitioned, it‚Äôs *not allowing someone with a biological advantage from testosterone on a team formed so people without that testosterone advantage can win, but they can play in the general league*. It would be great if they could affirm their gender identity in this specific way without being unfair to others, but they can‚Äôt (if they haven‚Äôt fully transitioned). If everyone in the league is ok with it, then sure, but in a competitive league, that‚Äôs usually not the case. 

Not everyone can get everything that makes them happy. What if someone had abusive parents that stopped them from having a normal childhood, including playing in middle school sports. It would make them super happy to be able to go back as a 30 year old and play in the middle school league. Should that be allowed? After all, it would be cruel to deny them from playing in the league that would make them happy.
I dunno what impunity means but yeah
No but for real, nuance is dead in the conversation about Trans people when it comes to Cis people.

Edit: come to think of it, nuance is dead whenever anyone of a minority is discussed by the majority
[removed]
Aren't hormone blockers like, more dangerous for bone health? Also like, literally all the other kids are going through puberty at that stage, and they would be too, just artificially
Is it a ban on participating or is it a ban on participating in ""lower"" leagues when they should be playing in higher leagues?
I did my best to explain that I believe this conversation is nuanced. I never said someone should be banned from a sport simply based on their sex, but I also don‚Äôt think someone should be able to compete just because they identify with a certain gender. My point is that biological differences are NOT negligible. You even agreed to my point, that you ‚Äúcould more than likely beat a cis women at a chunk of physical sports‚Äù. You agree that your sex has given you an advantage, even with starting treatment at 15. Now I get what your saying, that some people are just a freak of nature born into a rich family so obviously they have a massive advantage, they have unreal genes and tons of resources. But the advantage of male biology persists in every physical and economic cross section of society. I used world records to demonstrate that at the peak level of competition, where the athletes have very similar abilities and resources, there is still a gap between men and women. The argument that biological sex is irrelevant to competition is just wrong. Say it‚Äôs bigoted if you will, but centuries of data show a difference.
I worked at raising canes for four months. I started working there in November, and I could lift heavy objects easily with barely any trouble. Started taking hormones in december, and about a month or 2 later, I was struggling to lift things that weren't really heavy.
Agreed. Your original comment (at least the first sentence) made it sound like you were saying there was confirmed to be no advantage
I still think trans women should be able to compete. No solution is without drawbacks, but the way the olympics currently works is the best in my opinion (making sure testosterone has been at typical female levels for a year). No trans women holds any athletic records so it obviously isn't some huge advantage like having testosterone is. I'm sure there are some small residual advantages, but every body is unique and has it's advantages inherently. As long as it's not game breaking I don't think it's much of a problem.
I mean most pro leagues aren't gendered. If there was a woman good enough to be in the NBA, MLB, etc they would already be playing most likely. She certainly would if she was a top player. There have been some women who compete in college baseball though I think. Also, women are on even playing grounds for track, swimming, and stuff like that and there's never been a woman close to the level the top top men are. I don't take any satisfaction from that, but it might be disheartening for some women if there's no womens division.

Edit: I feel like I should say that I support trans women who want to compete with other women. I would want to do the same if I was playing a sport competitively. I just think they should probably be required to have taken HRT like the Olympics requires.
It's easier to accept a comfortable lie than to see difficult truths... It's why scapegoating/whatabout-isms/etc. works:  it asks no change from the people who *could* change things if they just stood up.  Complacency is the name of the political game.  It's why in some ways, it's possible the former US president's election may have been a best case scenario... It shook people awake who weren't before and made them pay attention to politics again.
I think it‚Äôs fine, I just think at that point you should also allow biological males to take testosterone to help if they have lower levels. Like if we‚Äôre fine with adjusting hormones for the sake of fairness we might as well allow it in general
Yea your not wrong, went into the wrong lesbian subreddit one day and just commenting got me over 100 downvotes within a day
Exactly, and even worse! Being a woman who likes women ;-; those lesbians in that specific subreddit didn‚Äôt like that v much
Testosterone on its own is not the most influential.  Over time, testosterone assists in muscle development, bone growth, and many other things.  Many of which are irreversible.  And if you‚Äôve EVER played a sport, you‚Äôd realize that skill and size are the most influential factors.  Sometimes being smaller and agile is the advantage, but more often than not, being larger is the advantage, whether it be height, muscles, density, whatever.
Yea tought so, sad :(
How is it okay to say cis women are allowed to be better than other cis women but trans women can‚Äôt be better than ANY cis women because it‚Äôs an unfair advantage?
Agreed, they want trans to mean an abstract topic they get to judge and rule over. It's about power
This highlight the need for either having everyone compete together, without any segregation by gender or by sex, or create multiple categories depending on individual's physique 

It is already partially done for Paralympics (classification by type and level of disability), as well as in a few sports like wrestling (weight categories). Each high level sport should have categories relevant to the advantage or disadvantage given by specific body characteristics.
not to mention access to facilities, income, class!
Good thing the data says we don't have to worry about this with trans people because after sufficient time on hrt there's no inherent advantage!

BTW where's this energy for every other inequality in sports performance? Should the sports careers of a short person suffer just for the sake of ""let tall people be who they are and play too""? Are you as angry about the huge impact being born into a family with wealth has on a person's ability to train and improve as an athlete? Are you as angry about Michael Phelps having a literal verifiable genetic advantage over everyone he's faced? Or are you only angry about the hypothetical advantage that some trans women could have against some cis women?
So I swam growing up. Afabs are faster till they are 13 on average. Afabs start puberty ealier than amabs so they start developing earlier. If a trans woman has access to puberty blockers and hrt they will have literally no advantage. You can try to argue that they will be taller to wich I say cis tall girls are a thing. When I swam I was 5 10 ish 160 lbs and would compet against 6 4, 200lbs men so that ""issue"" is not trans based.
I'm gonna put this as simply as i can: some people are just better at things. 

Someone can train all their life for something and get demolished by someone who put in half the effort. No one, cis or trans, is immune to this. 

If you can't deal with losing, with being pit against people who are different from you, you shouldn't be doing sports.

Sports aren't fair, have never been fair, and should not be fair.

A cis woman or intersex woman with high testosterone should not be made to take suppressants because her being better hurts other people's feelings. She's just better and should be allowed to win because why is it her career that needs to be sacrificed, why is her career worth less, and why is her effort worth less than anyone elses. 

Everyone comes to the starting line with different advantages. What we decide are unfair ones are entirely arbitrary
What you're describing is an insanely rare situation. Fuck off, I'm done with yours and people like you's rhetoric.
im nonbinary (ftnb) and my school allowed me to play first setter on the men's volleyball team so i guess my optimism comes from experience, but i do see what you're saying.
No? Why should she be kicked off?
So an olympian cis woman who was born with many natural advantages over other women shouldn't be able to compete them either. 

It's nonsensical. If you're concerned with fairness then honestly look at what is fair for an individual. If they are transitioned and fall within the same range of ability as cis women, they should be allowed to compete.

Remember Laurel Hubbard, the weight lifter who qualified for the olympics? Everyone was screeching about how she was going to be smashing records and yet she didn't even place. So I don't see a difference between her and any other woman who has the natural physicsl advantages that help them reach that level. 

There was Lia Thomas the high school swimmer who won an NCAA championship, but what's never mentioned is that she [performed within the same range as her cis counterparts.](https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/lia-thomas-trans-swimmer-ron-desantis-b2091218.html) She didn't clobber them or smash records, she performed about the same as the previous year's cis championship winner.

And these are top performing trans women, how many trans athletes never rise to even that level? Do you even know?

What it sounds like you're really saying is that unless a trans athlete loses, they have an unfair advantage.

This is exactly what I'm talking about when I talk about people refusing to let go of stereotypes and instead examine the reality in front of them and whether it actually warrants banning trans athletes.
Trans women on HRT don't have an advantage over cis women either
You generally have to be on blockers for hormones to work for mtf. More to the point, there is no consensus in studies that blockers cause bone problems. Several say no, some say they do with certain drugs in a small percentage of the population, but not in general. You also have to allow a certain amount of puberty to happen for the child to ever have sex when they grow up or to have bottom surgery for mtf trans people.

Edit: I should not have said you have to be, that was ftm exclusionary. I do understand there is mono therapy with higher estrogen.
It was much more dangerous with the older forms of estrogen which they no longer use.  Blockers can lead to some bone density loss if they‚Äôre on them long term, but ideally after a year or two the child, parents and therapists are confident in the gender dysphoria diagnosis and begin cross sex hormones which don‚Äôt carry the same risks.
Ever single drug on the planet has possible side effects. I maintain that transition drugs should always have child, parent, and healthcare provider consent, and should have constant monitoring.

It's the same with certain antidepressants causing an INCREASE in suicidal thoughts. If that happens, the drug should stop because it isn't making things better. Same deal with hormones and hormones blockers. You have to be careful and aware.
They are dangerous with extended use, hence why cis kids don't take them for 10 years.
It's a ban on all, children are being banned from playing sports at school with their peers, it's not just about professional institutions. Most concentrated in K-12, but the bans have been known to include college sports. https://www.lgbtmap.org/equality-maps/sports_participation_bans
I can see you've posted another comment but I'm not able to view it so I thought I'd address this also- my sex hasn't given me an advantage. I'm a trans male, I take testosterone, as stated. The fact you somehow correlated ""I started taking testosterone at 15 and am aware I could now slam a rugby game against the average cis woman easy"" as 'this person is biologically male' is a bit concerning for somebody who's trying to project the image of being educated on this subject. My sex is female, I have no trouble keeping up with, or in quite a few incidents, out-lifting my cis male friends- that's because I was able to access treatment when I was, my body was able to achieve parts of male puberty that would be otherwise uncommon, like my bone density and even my shoe size going from a women's 5 to a men's 11. This is why you are not helping the argument, you are not giving anything useful to the debate, you are just continuing to push the narrative that we don't believe sex is real- when in fact we are literally growing hoarse from screaming that we believe sex is real, relevant and so much more complex than a non-athlete especially could ever hope to comprehend.
Again- nobody is arguing that sex is irrelevant. You aren't helping the conversation, you are just continuing to fuel the false outrage in regards to and alienation of trans people. We are telling you to let children play with other children, we are telling you to examine and change the fundamentals of how sports institutions and categorisation works- FOR EVERYONE, so that everyone has a chance to excel, without advantage.
I pull muscles constantly now because my brain tells me I should still be able to lift it no problem. I usually still can lift them, but it takes a bit more preparation and technique to do it properly.
Ultimately the current weight of evidence says there is no advantage. If independent studies come out that prove otherwise then my mind will change as the data does.
Oh yeah i completely agree with there being an HRT requirement for competition and i think a lot of places require 2 years minimum before they‚Äôre allowed to compete.  But i still think a division system would work where athletes of a certain sports would test there abilities and get a scoring that places them into a certain division.  No this isn‚Äôt like a hierarchy of divisions like the goal isn‚Äôt to get to a higher division but just to succeed within your physical ability range.  Yes that might make strength *specific* sports more male based but a lot of agility and dexterity and even certain strength sports i would easily see being a lot of women in the top brackets of all the divisions.  But even in the case of strength sports, like weight lifting or something a women can easily still become top in the division when competing against other people of similar weight and size and muscle mass and whatever other factors would go into placing them in divisions, and no top of one division would be better than the top of another.  Again like wrestlings weight class system.  Like it‚Äôs not any more of an achievement to be top of the heavy weight division than it is to be top of the lightweight division.  With a gender system there are *all* shapes and sizes of people within both genders so i honestly think pitting a 90lbs dude against a 170lbs dude, for example, in any sports gonna give one a biological advantage over the other.  Thats kinda my argument against the gender system is having a body run on testosterone might *statistically* cause people to grow more muscle mass but thats not *everyones* case in fact i‚Äôd even argue it‚Äôs not most peoples case.  So going on purely physical ability and aiming to be top of your ability range would be a better system in my head.  It‚Äôs also funny you never heard the transphobic people talk about AFAB men in sports lol or really talk about them in general :/
I mean that‚Äôs perfectly fine especially if someone is at a disadvantage because of it, if they can match levels or get them fairly close then there isn‚Äôt really an issue.
Fuck them.
Wait, no. DON'T. They'd love that.
...dawg. What?

""Testosterone isn't the most influential sport-related factor in the body, it just affects more things related to sport than anything else""?

You're also pretty plainly wrong - the only irreversible features of androgenic development are bone structure and vocal chord thickness. Everything else has been shown to reverse to within cis-fem levels.

If you've ever played a sport, you'd know that recovery and training time are some of the most important factors in achieving success - those are also the factors most affected by a gender transition that leaves someone with low T.
Voice training is easier for most of us than you'd think tbh
Really?   It isn't a matter of it being ""okay"" or being ""allowed"".  It's a matter of starting off with an unfair advantage.  Coming to this opinion gives me no joy.
>Good thing the data says we don't have to worry about this with trans people because after sufficient time on hrt there's no inherent advantage!

Then I guess the question becomes after how much time is there no inherent advantage? After that time it would be hard to argue that there is an advantage to disqualify them at all.

>BTW where's this energy for every other inequality in sports performance? Should the sports careers of a short person suffer just for the sake of ""let tall people be who they are and play too""?

The distinction is that as a society we have determined where to draw the lines. And yes, some leagues restrict for certain traits rather than by gender. And some by disability. And some by [height](https://thedailytexan.com/2019/01/25/short-students-can-now-play-in-a-league-of-their-own/). 

At risk of comparing women to having a disability, which is NOT my intention, can we have individuals identify as disabled and the compete in the paralympics? We create sectors of competitiveness and draw lines for a reason. 

>Are you as angry about the huge impact being born into a family with wealth has on a person's ability to train and improve as an athlete?

You have me mixed up, friend. I am not angry about any of this. I simply saw the post in /r/all and find the issue to be incredibly nuanced. There seemingly is no one way or even a myriad of ways that are fair to everyone involved. I enjoy trying to discuss and find the best ways in this case. That is the purpose of a discussion forum, no?

>Are you as angry about Michael Phelps having a literal verifiable genetic advantage over everyone he's faced, or are you only angry about the hypothetical advantage some trans women could have against some cis women?

Again, not angry.
>some people are just better at things.

Yeah, they are. And that's why we create leagues and distinctions. 

>If you can't deal with losing, with being pit against people who are different from you, you shouldn't be doing sports.

Aight, no women's leagues then and no paralympics. They can all compete against each other. 1 league. Easy.

The issue is not that some people are better. It is that these leagues have been defined to only include a subset of the population who fits certain criteria. 

>A cis woman or intersex woman with high testosterone should not be made to take suppressants because her being better hurts other people's feelings. She's just better and should be allowed to win because why is it her career that needs to be sacrificed, why is her career worth less, and why is her effort worth less than anyone elses.

Because the definitions and requirements to participate are the league and community's to set. 

If they wanna compete, compete in the open/men's league.

Except they don't want to. Because they lose there. And they think they fall into the definition that permits a person to compete in another category. But perhaps they don't. 

>Everyone comes to the starting line with different advantages. What we decide are unfair ones are entirely arbitrary

What we decide are unfair ones are not arbitrary. They are based on the collective understanding of what the traits of the group permitted to compete are. 

I am 100% fine making every sport have an open league where anyone can compete and then sub leagues for women and para and any other designations that need to be made. Then it's up to the organizers if the person is deemed to have have a certain advantage or not and whether they qualify to participate in the specified sub-leagues.
Puberty Blockers are different from HRT. For a transfemme, HRT is an anti-androgen (to block T) and E. transmasc just take T, which regulates E. You take puberty blockers to not start puberty, so you have more time to figure out your gender, or to stop precocious puberty.
You definitely don‚Äôt need to be on blockers for hormones to work
Edit; for FTM not sure about MTF.
Tbh I didn't know that about mtf. Im speaking from a ftm perspective. For a majority of ftm's, we don't have to go on blockers
Interesting to hear. Thanks for your thoughts
Well that's fucked
You know your comment reminded me of that one trans man in Texas, i believe, who was forced to participate with cis women in wrestling and wiped out the competition because he had already started testosterone
Ya know what? Fair enough. Your original post said ‚Äúlet‚Äôs talk about that more in depth‚Äù and that‚Äôs what I thought I was doing. Never was my intention to alienate or discriminate against trans people. I can see how I‚Äôm beating a dead horse with centering the conversation around sex. Yes I totally misinterpreted your personal experience and I‚Äôll accept that foot in my mouth. I think we would actually share many similar opinions if not separated by a screen, and my writing ability doesn‚Äôt help here. But yeah, the way athletic institutions stand currently, sex is a pretty key factor. But I do think there are absolutely alternatives the the ‚Äúmen‚Äôs team/women‚Äôs team‚Äù structure. What that would look like I‚Äôm not totally sure.  I was hoping to begin dialogue but I can see how I went about that the wrong way. Tbh part of the reason I‚Äôll make a post like this is to challenge my own bias/beliefs. Goal achieved, thank you for the insight (genuinely not sarcasm).
Yes but when I just examined sports institutions I‚Äôm immediately labeled a bigot. You want things to change but don‚Äôt want to actually talk about it. It‚Äôs nuanced, it requires multiple perspectives and discussion. I have never put trans people down or said that they shouldn‚Äôt be able to compete, but because I don‚Äôt wholeheartedly align with your narrative, I‚Äôm simply fueling the fire. I hate this new idea that ‚Äúif you don‚Äôt agree with everything we believe then you must be a bigot‚Äù. I agree that other systems could work, like rather than men‚Äôs and women‚Äôs teams it‚Äôs all one team with different divisions based on performance. But idk! That‚Äôs the point, we gotta talk about shit without being offended to actually come up with solutions.
Yeah, I'm pretty sure I'm lucky I never injured my back with the way I had to lift everything.
Me too. Ultimately there are so many various factors at play that it‚Äôs hard to determine a biological difference. And I‚Äôm not nearly good enough at biology to determine anything for myself
They wouldn‚Äôt, I‚Äôm pre-hrt etc so they def wouldn‚Äôt love that
Simply taking testosterone does not give you an advantage in sport.  Trans women lose a small amount of muscle mass, but on a professional, or even amateur scale, the difference is negligible.  Average strength in trans women remains more than average strength in cis women.  

I played college basketball, so that pretty much invalidates your last statement.  Testosterone allows men to grow faster than women.  When a trans woman transitions and her body stops releasing so much testosterone, it does not automatically make her as strong as the equivalent cis woman.  Therefore, testosterone is not the main factor.  If it were, the men that produce the most testosterone would almost ALWAYS be better than other men at whatever physical task is at hand.  That‚Äôs not the case, because some men are simply born stronger than other men regardless of the amount of testosterone they produce.
Voice training scares me
Why is it an issue now when it was never an issue before republicans started their culture war against trans people?

All of these sports bans are just punishing trans women for daring to be mildly exceptional in public.  It‚Äôs just as stupid as saying sports should be split by race.  Oh hey, this also does that because of course these rules apply way more often to women of color than to trans women.
You‚Äôre correct about ftm and I didn‚Äôt consider what sub I was on. Mono therapy for mtf is a crapshoot and is generally not recommended, especially not in the beginning.
Transfem people don‚Äôt need blockers either, they just need an adequate amount of estrogen in their system to cause testosterone production to decrease. Easier to achieve this with injections than pills, though standard care still tends to start with blockers by default.

I‚Äôm transfem, never been on blockers, injection monotheraphy and suppressed T-levels straight away.
Well yeah hence the outrage, but sensibility, inclusion and common sense go out of the window when it comes to the topic of trans people or trans children, as always
Oh shit, you'd never guess who I was being forced to change clothes with + play sports with while I was there growing chest hairüíÄ
They want a taste of your forbidden rainbow fruit, & are mad cause they can't have a bite.
Nah, they want some of that, that's why they're grumpy.
There's so much wrong with your comment, wow. Gonna try and go through it bit by bit.

Yes, the act of simply taking testosterone alone doesn't give you a guaranteed advantage. That's why sports have TUEs, to allow folks that need supplemented testosterone to participate competitively. HOWEVER, that's only because TUEs are necessary to get some folks back into competitive levels of testosterone. If T had no bearing on sport, these wouldn't exist. 

It is true that when a trans woman begins transition, they don't immediately fall to cis women levels of muscle mass or strength. Obviously. It takes about three years for things to equalize, which is why most sports organizations have a two-to-three year rule for transitioning athletes. After that period of time, though, contradictory to what you're saying: *muscle mass, fat percentage, grip strength, heart and lung capacity, bone density, and hemoglobin counts all fall to within cis female levels.* At that point in transition, many trans women are going to start to fall behind in competition due to lower testosterone levels compared to cis women causing both increased insulin resistance (shown to also affect muscle mass, fat amount, etc.) and taxed recovery. 

To say ""the difference is negligible"" is just plain scientifically wrong. If that were the case, one would expect the Olympics - an association that's had a rule on transition since 2003 that simply limits testosterone levels and does no diligence on actually checking if athletes compete in their gender categories average range - to be rife with trans competitors. Instead, only one trans woman has ever competed at the Olympics during her transition, and she took home no medals.

While average strength in trans women does remain higher than cis women, this statement is misleading. It's a higher average that still falls entirely within average cis ranges, meaning there are just as many cis women stronger than the average trans woman as there are weaker. We simply fall closer to the middle.

And on your final point, yeah, you're right! Testosterone isn't everything. But it contributes to the most important factors of sport in many fields, especially basketball, and while you're not gonna see top athletes with higher levels of T than anyone, what we *do* see is a higher average level of testosterone present in athletes that do basketball. Across the board.

Hope you're able to consider some of these points rather than continue to stick to the misinformation you've been fed. If you have any questions, let me know.

Edit: final point I wanna tack on here: there's also this assumption that's pretty prevalent that seems to suggest trans women are just cis men before transition, when that's actually not the case. There's evidence that trans women have, on average, less dense bones and skeletal musculature, less muscle mass, and less hemoglobin *before they even start their transition.* Meaning transition will further affect that! 

It's a curious study because they managed to find out some crazy new shit while the body of the research ended up being useless since they underdosed their trans subjects. *But,* it was an alright treatment at the time the study was conducted, so I can't really blame them.

Don't get me started on the F-in republicans.  But my position has nothing to do with them.  And just because some assholes use a position I support, to further their agenda, doesn't mean I am going to abandon my position.  

If I knew of a way to reconcile my support for the community and the need to be fair, believe me, I would whole heartly support it.
Yes, I edited my comment and apologize. Some people can mono therapy, although wpath reccomends blockers for mtf. I did make a ftm exclusionary statement, that I didn‚Äôt mean to make.
Oof, i feel for you my guy
Oop
Im Just glad most lesbians I know ain‚Äôt transphobic
Sadly I‚Äôm still single and lonely thoughü§£

I got no clue how to do any of that
I didn't really care at the time, most of my friends were girls on the team, so i was just happy to be allowed to play- I can't say the same for everyone on my team and I definitely can't say it for people who competed against us lol- but that's the route they're choosing to go, so they can wallow in losing a trans man I guess

I‚Äôm so fucking angry and so fucking sad. Being afraid of someone ‚Äúcoming for you‚Äù is considered paranoid. But that is literally the life of a trans person. They are coming for us. I hate to spread panic. But we need to do something.
I  currently live and teach in Oklahoma. It's honestly hell I spend my days in boy mode with no real idea if and when I can get hrt ( mostly because of my profession not because I'm under 26) but I refuse to leave because I feel I would be abandoning those this hurts the most.
Clever, 26 is when parent insurance ends. Definitely on purpose. Leave them at the end of the wrong puberty with no resources to help. Diabolical....
Get a OK rep to file a bill prohibiting anyone under 25 from joining the military, citing safety numbers and dissatisfaction surveys. 18 is obviously entirely to young for something that dangerous.
The sad thing is this is only the beginning. If this shit gets passed, they are going to aim for banning GA care altogether. This is the beginning of a genocide. Don't go down without a fight. Protest, get armed, and let these fucks hear our voices.
I‚Äôm 21 living in New York and I cannot fucking begin to imagine the idea of being told ‚Äúyou are not old enough to transition‚Äù what the fuck!!!
Gender affirming care doesn't specify transgender. 

So basically even cis people who have some deformities/problems related to that would be banned from treatment? How's that different from preforming surgery on intersex babies? Or circumcision? I bet they have no problem with that even though you can bet those babies are younger than 26...

What about a cis woman who lost her ovaries, or a cis man who lost his testicles? How's that different from a post-op trans person needing HRT?

Those governments have no idea what they are passing. I just hope people in USA can have a better future.. It's sad (but a reality) seeing people flee their country because some politicians are trowing tantrums and have power too.
If we do nothing is absolutely% going to happen. We thought the abortion ban was too inhumane to be passed. They don‚Äôt give a fuck. Republicans are a pest and they want to end trans existence. It was never about the kids.
Fuck that shit. Move to a trans friendly state. Or move out of the country. 


Land of the free my ass. God forbid that you have freedom because that intrudes on my freedom of not seeing trans people.
It seems like this is a very anti trans year in some global powers
Move. Or vote and protest.

Or do diy hormones.

I think Republicans struggle to understand that trans people will always get hormones. It's just a matter of whether it comes from an affordable, informative, and safe source.
Arkansas passed one to ban it for teens. This one in OK is even more extreme. The one in Arkansas is being challenged by the ACLU and their
Plaintiffs. The law has currently been banned and healthcare continues but a new decision is expected soon that will determine a lot. The decision in this case will carry weight in other states doing this. Holding out hope for all to be able to continue their gender affirming care. Keep your eye on Brandt v. Rutledge, the Arkansas case.
I live here, and I have no fucking clue... I want to leave this state, but where...? Too expensive to travel far and we're surrounded by states just as bad as here... I fucking hate it here... What's the point when you're surrounded by people who want someone like you dead...? Just for trying to be fucking happy with yourself for once in your miserable life...
They are running the same playbook against trans healthcare that they did against Roe v. Wade. This is part of their plan, and it's working.
I'm 66f cis and what we all need is for the Supreme Court to rule that after the age of 21 and before with parents consent laws can not interfere between patients and doctors. It is not any of anyone's business.
It‚Äôs time to acknowledge the weakness of the democrats. Hell, it was time years ago. They can‚Äôt and won‚Äôt protect us. We need to make our party stronger, or soon, none of us will be safe
This is unacceptable and TRANS RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS !!!!! this is really upsetting to me and made me very frustrated.  I am a PROUD MOTHER of a TRANS SON,his name is Aiden and his the most bravest and courageous boy I know. Not only do I speak for my son ,I speak out for all the trans people on this world that's is wrong and unacceptable. You are loved and you are in your right to choose when and what you to do with your body. I'm sorry if I said anything offensive,I don't know I'm a mum sometimes I put my foot in it but I have my son to correct me. His amazing and so are you all my beautiful trans community. You are not alone on this and I hope and pray you can overturn this bill.I just can't believe this all the people under 26 have to go back no that's fucking torture.  I've seen My son going through so much and I've tried to be there for him but before he came out he was so suicidal and self-harming  because he wasn't happy. Finally, he transitioned and his finally happy I'm so over the moon for him. Ultimately I just want my kid to be happy no matter what it is. Sorry so my point is I'm very worried about the people that have to change back,I know that'd going to be torture for them and it's really worrying .

On how yo prevent.. well sorry to say but I think it's time to get militant, cuz words obviously don't reach these knuckleheads. We need to start treating it for what it is: A war against transgender people.

Create a group/party like the Black Panthers back then. Stand against hate-crime and provide for the community. The BPP launched a lot of survival programs for the community, providing food, medical assistance etc.

Ya'll could do something similar. Maybe there are doctors who are trans or allies who can help with DIY HRT under the radar. People who can give shelters for those who are thrown out of their homes because a homeless transperson is IN DANGER. Especially if it gets so bad they can't even get a job and have to rely on the black market (drug & sex trafficking) to survive. Teachers in case this progresses to the point where going to school is not safe for transgender folks due to violent bullying.

Forming groups and going out in groups decreases the danger because people are less likely to attack groups especially if they are armed

And yes, use your rights as americans and get a strap and learn to use it. Because Republicans don't fret from flexing their guns. You can't walk around unarmed if the enemy is armed to the teeth. 

I wish I could do more to support but I live overseas :(
Fuck laws!!
26 this is crazy.. Must be the same fighting for the right to not to wear mask and contaminate everyone that are now voting to restrict others liberties...like here in Quebec, our paternalistic prime minister decided that  you have to be 21 to buy cannabis but you can buy alcohol at 18???. Not too long ago you could mary at 14.
Just because a bill is introduced doesn't mean it's going to be voted on or even get real consideration. 

Bills in state Congress or federal Congress are written every day and introduced in committees for political brown nose points but never make it before the full Congress to get a vote.
I‚Äôm literally so tired of being trans, it‚Äôs just so hard I just want to live my life as a human being without all this pointless political and even religious pressure, I want to walk in the streets and feel safe that no one will come up to me yelling some slurs or even worse. I‚Äôm just so tired, it‚Äôs not that I hate being trans, it‚Äôs just that people made me hate it, I can‚Äôt do this anymore. We are human being and I still can‚Äôt understand what‚Äôs wrong with being BORN with something you can‚Äôt control.
Rise up and riot
There are very few things you could do that would matter, outside of certain extralegal tactics (which are not recommended btw)
God, the world is fucked up.
England is being shitty with Scotland's attempt to make transitioning easier for trans people and now Oklahoma being shitty with trans people in general.
Oklahoma is trying to go one step further too and wants to block public funding to places proving gender affirming care as well: https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB250/2023
You can constantly remind people that this hate has no reason, and therefore cannot be satiated by any reasonable action.  Once they're through with us, they'll be going after the disabled (already on the docket at SCOTUS), they're already screeching antisemitism, it's only a matter of time before real killing starts.  People need to get actually WOKE to the fact that it's happening NOW.
I have a soultion but it‚Äôs not legal
Country's fucked.
Quit playing by the rules.
I see a lot of comments complaining about this and about how you should move away, but I don‚Äôt see a lot of people saying to actually do anything to prevent this‚Ä¶ Truth of the matter is, if everyone does nothing, people will continue their crusade.
The people who have the power to make this happen are just as mortal as we are. This is all I have to say.
What happens when a 22 YO solider gets assigned to FT. Sill OK and has to de transition.  It ain‚Äôt gonna happen because that solider won‚Äôt go to FT. Sill and the opening will remain vacant.
I have several idea that are in no way legal (and they could get me banned on this subreddit for threats of extreme violence) so I'm not going to share them. I hope every Oklahoman Republican gets what is coming to them however, that is a fact.
Ride out and meet them. They think they can shove us out of existence? Show the world how wrong they are.
r/transDIY
The only way we can fight these issues (imo) is to make the majority and other minorities care. It is not enough for the entirety of the LGBTQIA+ community to stand up against this tyranny. We need more help. We need more than our community to care. But it is a difficult battle because the people who support these tyrannic bills seem to be heavily miseducated and misinformed and or overtly religious extremists.
People should seriously consider moving.

Yes, I know it‚Äôs not fair. Yes, you shouldn‚Äôt have to. Yes, this is fucking awful.

But given the position we as a group are in, I think moving to a trans-friendly state or out of the country might be the safest option in the short term.
Vote Democrat across the board. Support organizations like Lambda Legal, Human Rights Campaign, and the ACLU as well as local LGBT rights organizations who will continue to sue the state if they ever make it past introducing the bill.
I just came out to my friends. I only just discovered this about myself recently. I live in Oklahoma and now I have no idea what to do. I'm at my wits end, I felt so close to freedom and now I'm not sure what's going to happen.
Literally makes me feel sick
Do the people sponsoring this bill have names and home addresses maybe? That might be a good place to start.
Ohio is trying also. Im scared for my kids. We have an exit plan and gave discussed it with the medical team AND their plans if need be. I feel like our lives are just waiting in rulings.
You know what I think you people should do? Get alot of the lgbt community to band together and revolutionize America, because America is a joke rn no joke.
You know, nothing legal comes to mind ngl
Riot. 

People need to riot it's the only thing that works.
Ok so I‚Äôm literally exactly who this bill is targeting, i stockpiled up on my meds in case this happened, but I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôll do if I run out, I won‚Äôt be leaving Oklahoma till this September for college
It's not savagery, It's genocide. We don't need to pull any punches when describing it, they aren't pulling any punches when trying to kill us either.
LITTERALLY murder
Question: is it just me or (ex-)confederate states are much more transphobic?
The age should be 18 without consent and 16/17 for minors. People are gonna suffer mentally if this passes. I wish we could veto as citizens and remove such a nasty bill!
[removed]
Nothing
Get elected to a state legislature somewhere and introduce a bill that makes it a capital offense to enter your state after having voted for a law prohibiting transition somewhere else. It will fail but it will send a message.
Move/j
I don't find this to be savage, definitely unreasonable however, once an indivudual reaches 18 they should be allowed to do whatever they want to with their body, and forcing detransitions sounds tedious and pointless if the person they detransition is just going to transition again once they turn 26....
Lol, they make this a law, nobody will follow it. There's plenty of stupid laws like no moose on planes and no silly string and no fireworks and other stupid laws nobody follows. Just because you make something a crime doesn't mean people won't stop doing it
Protest protest and more protests!
THIS IS NOT OKAY!!!!
I don‚Äôt live there but is there anything out of staters like me could do? Are there people to call and email? Maybe protests of some sort?
I wish i could do something, but i dont even live in the usa
Does filed mean it‚Äôs already passed?
I know this isn‚Äôt right but I just‚Ä¶ cried abt it
I'm so glad I'm in NY. This shit sucks. I hope things get better soon.
Oh but to enlist in the military and go die or get maimed, get mentally and emotionally traumatized, 18 is just fine.  That isn‚Äôt a life altering decision that should require maturity?  They even send recruiters to high schools and call kid‚Äôs homes to badger them about joining.  Hell, some parents groom their sons to go into the military as soon as they reach majority age.
Hope this wont come true for you all in Oklahoma!!!
How the fuck do you detransition? It‚Äôs like trying to deevolve a pokemon XD

Move to Canada everyone
Vote and arm ourselves
Im 34. If this passes, I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôll grow to include us all.
Thats it. As soon as i graduate I'm leaving this fucking hellhole. At least fr\*nce is pretty good with trans healthcare
As an intersex person, what do I do?
Under 26??????
They can't blame being a minor anymore bit that that excuse ever made sense this is authoritarian to the max.
Can‚Äôt we just like, have everyone that‚Äôs cool move out of Oklahoma and like let them secede and like maybe build rockets to laugh it into space. I personally wouldn‚Äôt miss it. And like all the cool people that moved out of Oklahoma (you know who you are ;-)) get like a voucher to move in to a house in the location of their choice that allows gender affirming care and is more progressive than Oklahoma‚Ä¶
I mean filed doesn't mean anything. Any lawmaker can file a bill, most never see the light of day.
Welp, it's time to release my GIANT LIFE-SIZED MECHA GODZILLA TO DESTROY ALL THE TRANSPHOBES!
Breast implants are a gender affirmation surgery. Why not go after these groomers.

How about those sick mother who dress their 5 year olds up like sluts and parade them around .....
If you want me to be honest the only way to stop it from coming to pass would literally be me breaking tos so take that for what you will
As a 14 year old in a state that tried to pass a bill that would make parents allowing their kids to be on hormone blockers an offense with a lifetime jail sentence, my cishet dad still tells me I'm just as privileged as he is and I shouldn't be worrying about anything but my grades.

He also tried to bring up other unrelated things, like how I'd been looking at (completely sfw) furry things online, such as how to draw a mothcat fursona cause them's cute, in the same conversation to try to prove how I ""always have to have the last word"",.
Arson
This is gonna sound LARP-y af but get together with some other radical queers and make it clear that as long as we aren't safe, neither are the fuckers pulling this shit.
Back in 2016 protest voters made a choice to vote 3rd party or not vote.  They were warned about the SCOTUS and the jeopardy for abortion rights, minority rights, immigrant rights and LGBTQ rights.  They decided they had enough privilege to weather a trump presidency and threw the vulnerable under the bus.  

I will never forget.
guillotines and guns
What is going on in America? The president sniffs little girls, it's like he's going through dementia and utters blatant rubbish. You are allowed to have guns but not allowed to have an abortion when u want and now this. No rights for a woman 
No rights for Trans community
No rights for the LGBT community 
Your America is not so great 
I'm sorry if this is offensive but it's the truth, you need a new president quickly.
We are at war. These people want to kill us. I‚Äôm not exaggerating, I‚Äôm not taking things out of context. They want us dead by their hands. Arm yourselves if you are safe to do so mentally. Reach out to other trans individuals in your area. Build a network that you can call up on. Organize. Write your politicians warning you won‚Äôt stand for it. Riot when the time comes.
As a lawyer, that is down right unconstitutional.  Maybe they have a case to ‚Äúprotect‚Äù children under 18, but why they feel the right to intrude on grown adults lives is insane.  The SCOTUS will of course uphold it.
Just don‚Äôt live in OK, why would you want to live there in the first place tbh?
Guess it wasn‚Äôt just about the kids after all?
Who's gonna vote the governors back in at the next election after this? (however the usa works?)
Oklahoma Bill and Buffalo Bob are transphobes!
Come live in Chicago. It's mostly LGBT friendly and fun hereüôÇ
[removed]
this is awful but I can't stop thinking abt that part in Hollywood by CSH that will says don't go to Oklahoma
Idk, but I don‚Äôt plan on being on this planet for much longer, this place is just constant pain
Do what they do, fight back, i hate to say it because i don‚Äôt have these issues in my country but we are too passive, the right would not sit here and do nothing is they‚Äôre supposed freedom was being taken away, it is only out of respect for other who do not deserve it that we do
Honestly I would arm myself and my family. Don't let those fascists touch you or your family. They are officially going to start to try and eradicate us and we have to protect our lives.
Vote
Burn Oklahoma to the ground. It‚Äôs the only option.
Angry transfem coming to raid a cvs near you
I don‚Äôt know, but I‚Äôm starting to actually hate living here.
Under the 10th and 14th amendment of the US constitution it would be illegal to force someone to detransition as the state can‚Äôt force a medical procedure be done on someone. No DA will be willing to lose their license with the Bar to enforce that even if it is passed.
Wanna get involved? Defend yourself and your communities, we can't keep these toothless spineless moments that crack under any pressure, we need to be willing to say, coordinate strikes, mass protest, block access to the facists' methods. They've been attacking us for a long time, it's long overdue to give them a bloody nose back
The Oklahoma legislature will ignore us and the Supreme Church renders the judicial system invalid.
Yeah, and considering I'm stuck in the south, I dunno what to do. I get people mad at me for just having a tiny trans flag heart-shaped sticker on my van.
It's only Paranoia if someone isn't out to get you. if someone is out to get you it's considered legitimate fear
Yep.

It‚Äôs an attempted genocide
I don‚Äôt want to live in Texas anymore:(
get guns, my friend. learn how to use them and hope you never have to. Armed minorities are harder to oppress. They won't ever stop infringing on our rights and year by year these things will keep happening, and if you think voting will do anything...it won't. Fascism slips through every small crack and keeps growing until it is destroyed by force.
That teacher guilt is real. It took me a year to two years to make the decision to leave for my own reasons. At the end of the day, you need to do what‚Äôs best for you.
Part of why they pass these bills is to get people with different opinions out of their state. So definitely stay as long as you can and help.
Ultimately your decision to move comes down to how long you're willing to fight. Stay and fight for trans rights in your home but don't let it ruin your life. If moving is the only way to live your best life then you should probably do that.
I am in the exact same boat. It‚Äôs especially bad with how poor our state‚Äôs education system is.
Right there with you in terms of living in boy mode during the day due to my profession but refuse to leave because I think we have a responsibility o stay and fight. There are good people in red states, including people who don‚Äôt currently support us
Here‚Äôs the thing 26 isn‚Äôt the goal. If they get 26 they‚Äôre happy. But if this gets taken to court they‚Äôll compromise on it and lower it to 21 citing ‚ÄúSee were the good guys for compromising‚Äù when in reality 21 is the goal.
Now this is a suggestion i was looking for
Not sure how this helps.

Given that the military is a federal institution, and OK government is perfectly happy to ensure their young people stay in-state working menial jobs rather than joining the military, the assholes who want to kill, imprison, detransition or drive out all the trans people would probably just view this as a win-win.
> prohibiting anyone under 25 from joining the military

18 is the age of mandatory military all over the world - because people's part of brain that creates fear only completely develops at the age of 25. One who wants to join the military at 18 is highly unlikely to do so at 25.

Additionally, at the game of 26 the brain stops developing and it's much harder to learn military techniques or whatever.

*Not invoking any opinion here, just providing some info*
Some people in this sub are part of the military willingly just an fyi.
Some states are trying to start with outright bans now. I will move out of state if anything like this passes a committee where I live, but I will never stop fighting wherever I go and for those back home. I only fear that we will be fighting for a long time.
Def safe in NY from this but it‚Äôs hard as hell to watch other states go through this.
Where is that bill from? Like state wise
Having just read the bill (SB129), there are exceptions that protect cis and intersex people‚Äôs access to gender affirming care. It‚Äôs very explicitly about preventing gender transition, with strict definitions of ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù and ‚Äúcross-sex hormones‚Äù and the like. That (ofc) doesn‚Äôt make it right, but it may make it more likely to pass.
Its about keeping Republicans out of power. However that means trusting democrats to actually pass something even tho they haven't in the past. Next election cycle isn't until 2024, most likely this will pass. We need biden to do something to protect trans rights at a federal level.
It‚Äôs always been about religion, pandering to those votes
Even if it were feasible for everyone who needs transition healthcare to move, I don't think we fight this by running away. If we do, we let these regressive monsters keep pulling the Overton Window where they want it to be. They get one step closer to establishing their Christofascist dystopia of Gilead. And I'm disinclined to giving the bigots the ""pure"" society they're after.

You can't pretend there's a wall around the places where hate, bigotry and inequality are most powerful and assume they'll stay there, that they won't follow everyone who flees.
[deleted]
If it's unsafe and unaffordable it's still a win for them
Literally. I would rather take potentially life threatening black market hormones than be forced to detransition. Like I don't know what they're thinking. The idea of what we would end up doing to ourselves if this bill passes 100% crossed their mind. They just don't care.
Ugh bad advice!  Do not do diy hormones please!
Oklahoman here too. My parents want to move to a blue state, but I can't imagine that would work for us. I'm their only trans child and I'm 27, so this bill in theory wouldn't effect me, but it's only a matter of time before they push it further and further. I hate it. I know they'll never leave us alone but I just want them to leave us alone.
They're literally declaring war too...
Yes, but the fact that this bill *exists* is a sad thing to see. And even so, they‚Äôre still using us as a punching bag for those brown nose points
Right on
Summed it up in one
This is the absolute saddest truth
It‚Äôs willful manslaughter at best, but they know what happens to us when our medical care is taken away.  It‚Äôs no different from seizing insulin or chemotherapy.

What they‚Äôre doing is mass murder and every one of them belongs in prison, at the very least.  I want justice God damnit.
*reads addresses*

*Immediately thinks of violence*

*Realizes watched too much designated survivor*
The Confederacy is a cancer that was never properly cut out.  A mistake that will inevitably have to be rectified.
Come to Pennsylvania or New York with me! Pretty ok ish up here for the most part! We got a supportive govener!
if we all unite and receive enough support from allies we can make this a country where we can *stay* and *live*
Moving a short distance is super expensive and inconvenient. Moving states possibly across the country is extremely difficult to do. Idk if ""move"" is good advice.
Where to is the question. Oklahoma is surrounded by red states. They might have to move to California or Arizona? I'm not sure what the nearest safe state would be...
I'd leave the country if I could.
Not that easy for most people
You serious? that nonchalance is what puts us at risk. We need doctors/healthcare workers to transition. If doctors face prison time and 100k+ fines for providing trans people with gender affirming care, *trans people won‚Äôt have access to doctors.* I don‚Äôt think you understand how serious that is‚Ä¶
Check the stickied comment at the top of this thread
It‚Äôs attempted mass murder already.   It‚Äôs attempted mass murder **of children**.
As far as I read (source: comments on this post) intersex people are excluded
Let‚Äôs be real here Oklahoma kinda sucks right now; it‚Äôs what I call the lame party invitee. They show up at the party they complain about the food that‚Äôs free n the booz that‚Äôs free they have rbf but don‚Äôt reassure everyone around them that they‚Äôre having a good time, then they never pitch in for drugs but have no problem partaking‚Ä¶they‚Äôre lame person at the party lol ‚Äúoh great here comes Oklahoma I thought you said the invite would get blown off cuz they were going out of town with their parents‚Äù‚Ä¶‚Äùit‚Äôs not my fault they changed their mind, no we can‚Äôt turn off all the lights they‚Äôre in the driveway lol shhh shh here they come just be cool‚Äù

I agree we need a new President, but they can‚Äôt decide on if state laws pass or not. Each state has their own laws that are separate from the ones that all states have.

Some people are born there and can't leave?
u live in Oklahoma ?
Thank you for this
Arm yourself and be ready to lay down your life.  That‚Äôs what freedom requires.
speaking as someone who lived 17 years being indoctrinated into christianity unsuccessfully, that fear can live on as paranoia, if conditions do change for the better. this is egregious behaviour on the part of those who wish to genocide us.
If we don't stand up, it won't just be attempted.
It‚Äôs attempted mass murder **of children** and every single American who doesn‚Äôt stand up against it is complicit.
Adding more guns to this gun-nutter filled country is not the solution. It just creates more gun violence.
I don‚Äôt think your house is getting raided or anything‚Ä¶ pepper spray and self-defense classes should suffice no?
[deleted]
believe me I agree its one of the things that I battle with quite a bit
Nah, its perfectly valid to not allow them to do this shit to you
I am trying. I will be honest if I loved my job any less than I do I would probably already be on my way to another state possible Washington
It‚Äôs true, and I know many people that have moved because of things like this. Moving is a powerful statement though. The people that care about you see you protecting yourself and sometimes they really stop and consider why you moved. 

You can be safe and still affect change in your former state.
Yeah people keep saying ""run"" or ""fight"" like they're each the only option, but like everything else it's more complicated than that.

If you *can* fight and you feel safe enough to then by all means stay and fight, but if staying and fighting would put your physical *or emotional* health at too much risk then running is the right idea. Neither is objectively ""better"" it all comes down to individual circumstances
oh trust me I understand that part, I teach special education and the state gives my kids the shaft all the fucking time
Seriously though, not to mention how trash a teachers wage is, if they raise the minimum wage then teachers will be making minimum wage with a college degree and doing one of the hardest jobs in the country. My mom is an elementary school teacher in Oklahoma, she was a Kindergarten/Pre-K teacher until she just couldn‚Äôt handle it anymore, so she moved up a couple grades. But yeah, the State‚Äôs education system is atrociously underfunded, and it really does show in the behavior of the state‚Äôs citizens
Yeah, I used to plan on leaving the state once I got out of school, but the more I think about it, the best way to affect change is to be in the thick of it. I mean, it took about 20 years of Civil Rights action from African-American communities in the south to finally put an end to segregation there, not to mention federal support. If history really does repeat itself, then we have to keep going. If not, step up our game, host protests, speak up more, and do what we can to create a movement to show just how inhumane these moves against us are and how dehumanizing it can be. There are a lot of trans people in the south, more than one might think. I go to church with three of them, myself included. My school has quite a few that I know of as well, and a lot more homosexual students. We could arm ourselves, but it would probably only be cause for a headline, ‚ÄúTrans People Take Up Arms Against the State.‚Äù Something to keep in mind, though, is that no matter what this state or any other does, it is ultimately futile as change is inevitable, and we will eventually be free to express ourselves and identify as who we are without fear of persecution from the masses, regardless of what people do against us now.
Go full nuclear with it. Ban recruitment offices (better yet, uniforms) within x distance of schools and universities. Force state schools to not allow anyone 25 and under to enroll in ROTC. Instruct school boards to trespass recruiting officers. Ban state entitlements (snap, ebt etc) from military members 25 and under. Draw as many parallels to trans discrimination as possible.
It's not something that could ever pass or likely be enforced. Just something to provoke an outrage cycle while drawing attention to the absurdity of the age 25 part of the anti trans law.
Right? Military might be a way for some folks to GTFO of OK. The Military isn't as fucked up about LGBTQ issues anymore as OK is. Not that it's great, it's just better than OK.
Well, all of that is kinda my point. If it is irresponsible to allow someone to transition because of brain development, then it is irresponsible to allow someone to do something arguably more dangerous. It would never pass, it's just a point to make.

Also, neuroplacticity lasts much longer than 26. It may begin to slow a little at that point but you have to be a much older dog than that to stop learning new tricks.
Navy vet here. I have zero issues with service in the slightest. I have zero issues with being able to join at 18. I do have issues with people saying that 18 is too young to make the major decision to transition but perfectly ok to make the decision to join the military. This isn't about fucking over the armed forces, but about highlighting cognitive dissonance
I'm an adult with private insurance so the bans under [X] age and blocking Medicare coverage for it don't affect me personaly and I can still fight, but if they go for an *outright ban* I'm out
Oklahoma
If it specifies like that the it's even more genocide-like... There's still post-op trans people who will basically be forced by law to have some pretty bad health complications
I'm in oklahoma, I'm old enough to not be effected by this outright, but my fiancee isn't. I need out of here and I need out of here yesterday.
I have seen nothing but other redditors suggesting that the US is the worst country ever and that you should move out tho. And anyone thinking that the us is the absolute safest and best country to live in for trans people is living in a fantasy land.
California, Massachusetts, Washington DC, Connecticut have legal protections. Guess where all the trans students will be headed for college.
Yeah, I wasn't trying to advocate for them. Just saying that that's something people are being driven to.

If at all possible PLEASE do it with a medical specialist
Sorry about my sarcastic comment. I ment it in more of a joking manner but as a fellow us citizen I am in full support and will also fight to save us. Because if the only solution is to move then there‚Äôd be no where to move after a while.
I ment it as more of a joke I didn‚Äôt mean seriously! I added a /j to be more clear sorry.
It's not as difficult as some people like to imagine. I moved from Arkansas to Denver with $2k, knowing no one and only having a part-time minimum wage job set up a head of time. I lived in a hostel for about a month while figuring shit out.
Oklahoma borders both Colorado and New Mexico. Colorado is one of the safest places in THE WORLD for trans and LGBTQ people in general. Besides Canada, there's no where I'd rather live as a trans person.
I‚Äôm sorry my comment was ment to be satirical. I added a /j to be more clear sorry.
I was trying (and failing) to be funny. I didn‚Äôt mean literally because like you said it‚Äôs not easy for lost people. I added a /j to make it more clear. Sorry.
Though you are right that trans individuals have access to the best care out of any historical context you are wrong about the intentions of this bill and it‚Äôs creators. 

If this bill was anything about protecting children then it would be written to educate and inform not ban and censor. This bill targets adults UP TO 26. 

Big Pharma is a problem and I wish there was another way to transition but that is it. If you‚Äôre on the side that says big Pharma = Bad then cool target their profit margins and nationalize healthcare don‚Äôt take it out on us just trying to live our lives.

What you don‚Äôt see is that denying this care or downright back tracking on allowing it IS a form of harm to trans individuals. Suicide rates for those without care jump significantly from those with. Murder rates jump for those that don‚Äôt pass. Harassment and assault too. 

And at the end of the day who‚Äôs fucking right is it to tell me what to do with my body? Mine.
*sighs* yup
Of course! As a bit of extra assurance, know that if a DA does try to force it it would very quickly make it to federal appeals where (while majority conservative judges) it would be shot down in less than a month under those amendments stated above. Neither the state nor anyone else is able to force medical procedures on another unless they are deemed medically incapable of making those decisions themselves (such as a state of unconsciousness and they are unable to awoken or psychosis which is medically testable and stating that trans people are mentally inhibited wouldn‚Äôt hold up in court anymore) or their medical decision directly impacts another (such as mask ordinances).

The worst that the state can do is outlaw gender affirming procedures within their borders. Outside of that they have their hands tied by the constitution.
*yep* üò°üò©
If we don't protect us no one will.
We are at war. Weapons are required.
The hell with that. They have guns. That means we need to have guns.
So your solution is to just be murdered when you COULD have the chance to avoid that fate? The cat is out of the bag on guns, it's better to have the option and willingly give it up later if gun regulation becomes successful rather than leaving yourself defenceless.
Not like the original people will stop if we don‚Äôt have guns (I‚Äôd rather a lunatic die than someone sane)
With these people not really (self defense should help tho)
molotovs on the other hand‚Ä¶
Considering how they're the party of freedom.... fuck yeah. You should have the freedom to choose your gender and your Healthcare.
Kansas isn't too bad on the trans front, believe it or not, and we're just next door!

...That said, there's no way I'm getting back in a public school classroom here anytime soon.
This is much better of an idea than to just arm yourself, although I still do think that personal protection is becoming more and more of a necessity for trans people in these states and generally across the county
There would need to be heavy media attention on it, though. Otherwise it wouldn't go very far.
If we lived in a perfect society, being trans wouldn't be ""a guy who wanna be a girl"", it would be ""the genes accidentally gave a Y instead of X"" (me is the example), and it would've been at the same level as a baby that their lungs don't work well enough - a medical procedure and nothing else.

ALL medical procedures are dangerous.

&#x200B;

>neuroplacticity lasts much longer than 26

I'm no expert, I'm just repeating others in this case ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
Some states (I can get the references once im back from the gym) are putting forth bills that make it so any hospital/clinic that prescribes hrt will lose any access to medicare/medicade. Any hospital or clinic will be forced to choose between helping trans people or losing access to funds that helps keep the doors open. That will stop it for everyone. It is the same tactic they used for indirect abortion bans. They are already coming for everyone and using any inches already conceded to do it.
Oh phew. I feel bad for my trans siblings there, but glad that the transphobic bills haven't gotten close to me (I am in Michigan)
Hmm I really don't know if it isn't even better to have complications(I am post-op) then basically detransition if you are banned from HRT pre-op. Detransition seems light horror nightmare. I would rather die omg.

I am glad I am not from US and that I have stock of HRT for years.
I feel for you and I'm not saying you shouldn't leave. If you can, go for it to save yourselves. I'm just saying that ""just leave for a better place and write off OK"" isn't an option for many people, and isn't an effective means of resistance (per the OP's question).

Lots of good states, if you're not in a green shaded state, I would be looking to move though.

However this may all become meaningless if the right takes control of the fed again, so even if you are in a good place you need to fight in whatever way you can.
Yeah when I had absolutely nothing fresh out of college I moved and spent the entire $4k I had. Now if I wanted to move I'd have to sell a house (which is time consuming and requires closing costs), I'd have to rent a large truck with towing ability to pull my car, in addition to finding new employment, and residence. Moving isn't impossible but it is a major pain in the ass. Even more so if you try to have things already semi in place when you get there. For me to move out of Oklahoma completely I'd need to have like $10k extra to spend on it and every day money is getting harder to build.
Its too early in the morning for me to remember geographic apparently. Colorado is pretty expensive to live in but either would be safer.
Theres a reason why the onion went out of business
I can teach how to make very powerful ‚Äútools‚Äù for self defense.
I live in Canada I have a bow Staff and a boxing knife
I have a genderfluid flag in my room but no one has broken in because of it yet
Thankfully I get mine through PP and they've lasted this long without it, I doubt these indirect hrt ""bans"" will stop them. They've already been off the state medicaid for years
It‚Äôs awful that bills like this are even considered.
Oh its fine for them. They'll say ""look at what we passed to protect kids! See, the liberal states don't care!""
I know that, and I can probably barely get out myself.
They‚Äôre just idiots. Plain and simple. No reason to argue with someone that is close minded
Agree, the US is generally terrible right now. I forgot to add Illinois having protections now too. As many states become more extreme in their discrimination and removing freedoms, others are rising to protect. It‚Äôs a GOP tactic to target the trans community. It triggers their base. Many colleges are going out of their way to be welcoming by offering Gender Inclusive housing and gender affirming healthcare at their health centers. It‚Äôs a great option for some, but trans people should not have to find these oasis centers. Living in the south, people are seriously having to consider ways to flee and where they can be safe. It should be safe everywhere for everyone, but it is not! Fleeing the country is more complicated, legally, than finding safe places in the US. BTW I‚Äôm from a very very rural state in the South. The oppression here is horrible and extreme. Just Google anti-trans in Arkansas. They‚Äôve banned gender affirming care, drag in public places with more than two people present. As worded, trans students can‚Äôt even perform in school drama, choir, band or Pride parades if wearing clothing not consistent with their assigned sec at birth. Now they are after bathroom restrictions and forced outings by schools to parents. It‚Äôs much like the Salem switch trials with all the fear mongering and hysteria. If you are in Costa Rica, be grateful as it appears rights have evolved in a positive direction.
Family has joined a lawsuit fighting it with all they‚Äôve got. They constantly consider moving. Tired of the hate and oppression.
It's not as expensive as people think. Poor people exist everywhere and Colorado has a lot of social programs for poor people. Colorado Medicaid covers all transistion related costs including surgery. 

Also the minimum wage is a lot higher here than other places (Colorado is $15ish while Denver is $17ish).

Plus you get what you pay for. Ever wonder why the cheapest places to live are also the shittiest? Yeah Alabama is like the least expensive state to live in but it's also fucking Alabama.
Won't deny that, I hate the bill even was written. But just glad it wasn't as close to my home as I thought it was
I hate those who even considered writing that. I tried portraying as respectful as I could. But see I failed. I am just glad it wasn't too close to where I live. Was worried it was with OP saying they're from New York
[deleted]
Its actually supposed to be cheaper to live in blue states. They tax the poor less
Good heaven! Yes, we‚Äôve been following other states and I know it‚Äôs bad where you are too. So sorry. No one should have to flee but it‚Äôs something that has to be considered when it gets this bad. My family joined a ACLU lawsuit in Arkansas trying to fight the ban on gender affirming care but so far the state keeps being unrelenting. I wish everyone nothing but the best in this horrible fight. I am confident the next generation will fix this mess. Our loved one is heading to Massachusetts for college. They have Gender Inclusive housing and offer gender affirming care on campus. Politics has definitely influenced her decision to leave our state. It makes me furious this is even an issue. Everyone should have equal rights everywhere in this country!
Lol that's not the only factor in cost of living"	10fe1iu	trans	2613	0.98	2023-01-18 18:02:43
Actually starting to get physically sick over the absolute massive legal push against trans existence in red States and in the UK. And this political attack will only continue to expand further if left unchecked		"The worst part is feeling politically helpless. Like as a demographic we have NO representation in congress, and very little representation in state government. There's nobody speaking up for us while the Republicans and Tories spread lies about us on national television and pass laws restricting our rights to self determination. Meanwhile we have to rely on the Dems and Labour to be our voice even tho they do the absolute minimum that's required to avoid ruffling too many center left or ""socially conservative"" voters feathers. 

But ya, it's sad
   Essay over sorry.
WE JUST WANTED TO LIVE

WHY?
Isn't 18 the legal age of adulthood?? How can they put trans medicine as the same age as one can drink alcohol, but you can get a BBL (most lethal surgery) at age 18????
This bullshit is picking up faster and faster. This will seem mild in the near future if we can‚Äôt stop it.
Funny how they won‚Äôt discuss raising the minimum age to enlist in the armed forces.  18-year-olds can make a life-altering decision to go to war for this country but aren‚Äôt  capable of making a decision as to how they wish or need to live and express themselves?
It‚Äôs important to know the signs of fascism and to be looking for way to push back /and/or invest In your safety.
Genocide in the making...
So half of this country is gonna ban being trans and make it illegal yet i feel like no one cares and so helpless about it, its Fucking our bodily autonomy to decide to transition not the Fucking idiots that run the states / government to decide, we are doomed here unless something big changes
Burn?
WHAT THE ACTUAL FUCK!!!!
This is starting to happen in my state of South Dakota to. It hasn't passed yet and I'm not sure how far along it is. But they don't actually care about the children. They show us time and time again that they hate trans people more than they care about children. The suicide rate is just going to go up for our youth and it can be completely blamed on Republicans.
over 120 anti lgbtqia bills in the US. This shit makes my stomach turn.
Very upsetting, frightening and extreme. Utah too!
not to mention the fact that us just being murdered in the street is becoming more and more normalized. why are we going back to a time where being yourself in public is punishable by death?

So a person who is 18-20 is a child? Because they want them to vote and go to war, but not choose what happens to their body? This is why i want to move. These states want my vote, but they don't want to give me my rights.
so instead of fixing actual problems in the US they decide to just take away human rights??
I live in a very accepting place comparatively, but it‚Äôs making me afraid, afraid of how people will see me. Seeing me as trans before human. I watched as the American republican ideals wormed their way across the border and had Canadians fighting over policies that don‚Äôt even exist here. I‚Äôve seen those people proudly toting flags around and I can‚Äôt help but worry. Worry about my future and all my trans siblings and all my trans youth.
So if a 18 year old changes their gender... and lives on their own... is that still child abuse? Feel they just want trans people to be more and more Oppressed
Wait so they're banning you consenting to a change yourself... And punishing *you* for it? That's certainly new. Normally these sorta laws attack those providing help, guess that didn't work out so well
WOW - you can own a gun and enlist in the army but you can't get gender affirming medical care

I think this just shows how completely F up our world is not just in America/UK but everywhere
And people said voting didn't matter in 2017.
Buy arms and munitions. Please be prepared to protect yourselves. Things are only going to get worse.
I worry that this bill won't JUST harm trans kids and young adults, but also lead to a bunch of cis kids, who need the same kind of treatment used for trans kids, getting harmed too.

...fuck this bill.   Politicians should stay the fuck out of medicine.
It's not even the *second month of 2023* why are they vomiting these disgusting bills so fast???
Please someone save us from this hell, we just want to live our life‚Äôs, be ourselves‚Ä¶ Is that too much to ask for?
if anything is ‚Äúgender disfigurement‚Äù it‚Äôs denying children access to puberty blockers when they need them.
My state (Texas) had an injunction filed on the order. This makes me sick.
Come to Minnesota
They'll never have any idea that HRT during puberty actually helps. Laws that do this to us are merely fucking dictatorship in the making.
Here in WV, they are trying to pass a law restricting any minor from attending a drag show. However, the language is so vague that it leaves the door open for someone transgender to be a criminal for simply dressing and existing in public where minors might be.
Someone please tell me there are solid legal challenges to all this nonsense.
United States‚Ä¶.. backwards as usual. Why wait? Just go back to the 1800s already. To all trans people Canada is welcoming you all.
WHAT THE FUCK??

&#x200B;

Well I guess this fascist bullshit is what happens when you leave capitalism to proliferate. Time to push back against it, trans and cis comrades!
It‚Äôs so fucking scary being a young trans person in this country. Republicans are actively trying to kill us and weak democrat aren‚Äôt helping us.
It's beyond frustrating and terrifying.
Yup, and Utah just banned it all too.

Fucking hate this state. Mormons are the worst.
Wait so it‚Äôs actually a thing now?‚Ä¶ someone please tell me cause I live in Mississippi and I‚Äôve been waiting almost 2 years to start medical transition and idk if I can mentally deal with knowing I have to push that even further back
I deployed to Afghanistan with a 17 year old.......................
This shit is so depressing
And then there‚Äôs Canada where my mom is always screaming at me to socially detransition because me telling people that she doesn‚Äôt accept me could put her in jail and take her kids away
Link to the article that I should have posted in the comments earlier: [https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/consenting-to-trans-care-under-21](https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/consenting-to-trans-care-under-21)

And an important paragraph of context:

*In Mississippi, a gender affirming care ban under the age of 18 just passed their state house by a 78-28 margin. Now, that same state house may consider a new bill that is both substantially cruel and also represents a major escalation should it pass. This bill would make gender affirming care in Mississippi classified as child abuse, would ban gender affirming care under 21 years old, and would make ‚Äúconsenting to providing or administering‚Äù gender affirming care ‚Äúto a person‚Äù illegal. It would define the crime as ‚Äúgender disfigurement‚Äù and would provide a 5-year prison sentence for those who violate it.*
**this makes me thirsty for bigoted blood**

but there are better ways to fight this shit

**but still, blood**
God. Just being alive is tiring enough. Why do they have to make it even worse? I wanna puke, honestly. Maybe I can aim my stomach bile towards a certain group of transphobic politicians...?
I live in Utah and recently heard about a bill like this passing here. Every time I think I can‚Äôt hate the Republican Party any more, they find a new way to rip my heart out. Thank god I‚Äôm 21, ig
There would be hope if the Supreme Court wasn't a shit show. But red states are going to get out of control with anti trans policy
Im curious what they mean by ""gender affirming care for youths"" like surgery and hormones? I feel like 17-18 years old should be the minimum age to get surgery and stuff....not 21? Thats ridiculous. I hope they don't mean puberty blockers because thats literally made for teenagers
Uh 21? I don‚Äôt think there should be any legal limits so long as the person consents but 21 is absurd. Like if I‚Äôm legally allowed to be sent on the front lines and killed for my country, I should be able to fix my body how I please
Twenty-fucking-one???? So you can go DIE in a fucking WAR at 18, pay fucking taxes at 18, get whatever *other* plastic surgery you want, but you can't be Transgender? What the fuck?

This is absolute bullshit.
Well said, this is disgusting
How can it be child abuse if you‚Äôre literally fucking 20.
Someday, this will all be something people look back on and feel disguisted by, not understanding why there was such hatred for us. For now, we have to pull through and fight as hard as we can.
Wait physically striking your child isn‚Äôt considered child abused but helping them transition is? I have bent my mind to the most extremes to understand any of the conservatives‚Äô logic and it is completely impossible. None of it makes sense in the slightest, how could they be so sure about something they know literally nothing about? They haven‚Äôt the slightest clue what it‚Äôs like to be trans or any of the research done about it, yet sit there and talk about it like they know what they‚Äôre talking about. But the most difficult part to understand is WHY? Why are they so hellbent on doing this to us with no understanding of what they‚Äôre doing? Do they somehow honestly believe that they are helping despite everything around them showing otherwise? When all of the research says that transitioning is the proper treatment and that trans people know way more about ourselves then they do? They barely understand anyone outside of the political sphere. None of it makes any sense at all, how do they not see that they are hurting people
All these right wing histerics are the dying breath of a political class barely holding onto power. None of them can win an election globally without enciting hate. 
10 years from now they will be remembered for their cowardice or completely forgotten.
So disheartening üòû
So is 18 not an adult anymore?
We have to fight for our existence...
Fight or be forgotten.
We are literally going backwards‚Ä¶ wasn‚Äôt Joe Biden supposed to be even slightly better than trump?
I'm not fond of violence, but may they remember we just wanted to be left alone
no bc this is true
over here theres a passed legislation that's restricting trans (and gay) rights. its actually sick tbh, idk if they've lifted it or not, i don't think so, but even if they did, that means theyre willing to make it illegal. either way, we did absolutely nothing wrong. we don't deserve any of this.
This makes me unreasonably mad. I don't ever plan to have anything to medically change my gender but I have been identifying as gender queer for some time now to some people. Most people just refuse to acknowledge it. I couldn't imagine being force to be someone I'm not and I'm so sorry for all who are affected by these stupid rules. I'm about to have a baby and my husband is a bit more strict about gender than I am. My belief is that my child is who they are and if they feel that their big doesn't match their contents I'll do what I can to make them feel comfortable. I also want to educate them before they make life altering decisions but ultimately I'm on board! You want puberty blockers? Sure let's talk about what that means for you. You want surgery? Alright let's talk about the risks involved. I am fine as long as they are educated. I know there are some who find a movement and cling to it when they don't really feel that way and it ruins it for the ones who truly feel stuck. I'm with you guys in whatever way I can be on this. Trans rights are human rights. üíóüíóüíôüíôü§çüíôüíôüíóüíó
this is genocide. defend yourself like it‚Äôs genocide
Isn't this like mass genocide? The trans suicide rate is already high enough üßçüèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
How is it child abuse giving care to an adult of age 20?
I have a theory, if everyone who supports us and every other minority that is discriminated against could come together, we could kill everyone at the top on both state and federal levels and literally coup de ta the absolute living crap out of this country and deport the bigots to somewhere they can be awful and miserable together. We‚Äôll forge a space where we don‚Äôt need to fight. This is all hypothetical of course but I feel like someone could figure it out
What does this mean?
21?! I would say 16-18 Is ok ... But 21?!
[removed]
Well there goes my friend.
Terrorism üò≥ /s
Why is this happening?? Why do they hate us so much
Its not going to stop people from transitioning
This is fucked up. Sending my most sincere support to y'all dealing with this shit. I truly hope it gets better.
Hey Mississippi... You might want to think that over. Majority of suicides are in the transgender community, if you take that early choice away from our community early on, the youth might not be able to live long enough to reach the age of 21. Gender dysphoria and depression are serious.  Stop making our lives more miserable, and start trying to make it easier to get to, it's ridiculously difficult to get a hold of prescription transition medication. If you are so transphobic that you think it's ok to treat anyone like that, and pass that as an actual law even though it violates one of our basic human rights according to our country. Pursuit of happiness. You should not be a state.
I live in Mississippi and this makes me sick, it's crazy
It sounds like if youre 18 in Usa and you go army and get killed,your parents can get sued of child molesting. Weird laws cannot understand. If the age is 21 for being adult prioring to translaws.
""Remember this: the Imperial need for control is so desperate because it is so unnatural. Tyranny requires constant effort. It breaks. It leaks. Authority is brittle. Oppression is the mask of fear. Remember that. And know this, the day will come when all these skirmishes and battles, these moments of defiance will have flooded the banks of the Empire's authority, and then there will be one too many. One single thing will break the seige."" ~ SW:Andor

They are fighting so hard because they know they will lose in the long run. While that doesn't help those oppressed now, it puts it into scope for us all. It is the basic state of a traditionalist to oppose change in a society's compact; and if change is preceeding without them, they use legal means to try and force others to stop changing within their lifetime. Once they die, the battle is forgotten, and everyone moves forward. They lose no matter what. Its really just a question of who they drag down with them.
I‚Äôve been looking at this post for minutes in class now, feeling physically ill
Meanwhile 18 year olds can go join the military :)
Oh sure because a person who‚Äôs seventeen years old can willingly enlist, eighteen can get drafted into a war, and have some of the deadliest surgeries alive, but an eighteen year old absolutely CANNOT be who they want to be unless it fits into a stupid narrative.

K. Gotcha. I don‚Äôt live there, I live in Texas, so it‚Äôll probably happen.

Good luck to all of you who are living with these laws. Shit may seem hard right now and it IS but you know what? You were strong enough to admit to yourself that you were trans, live with it, accept it, and pursue what you need for your mental health. If that doesn‚Äôt take someone strong I don‚Äôt know what does. If you can accept yourself for who you are, even in times like this or times worse than this, then you can make it. I believe in all of you. Wishing you all the best of luck,

your trans brother, K√≠eran.
What the dint wa t happy people? I say met people be. It it so the so called free country but people aren‚Äôt free to be themselves? This bull crap
North Carolina tried the same thing but was struck down around April 6 2021 at making the age 21 but it could change with roe v wade being turned over last year. So they might try again
I can't believe the misogony in this country
We need to stand up against the transphobes.
I live in Mississippi, uh what????
The federal legal age limit for adulthood is 18‚Ä¶ they cannot alter this. I don‚Äôt see how this can hold up in court‚Ä¶
Funny it takes an hour for this but decades to actually investigate Larry Nassar. The Bullshit is strong with this one.
Conservatives want us gone, huh? The feeling is mutual.
Riots Work.
honestly I'm tired of looking into politics, my parents are republicans but at this point, i literally dont have any thoughts on it bc I'm absolutely done with this.
Perhaps find a candidate that supports your beliefs first then help them through the processes of power till you do have representation, but I mean it about getting them to support you first because otherwise they might just be another politician that tells lies, and tell them of other mainstream topics and problems so others have something to rally for.
Buy a gun, meet other trans people and train
Cause the right wingers believes in theocracy and authoritarianism and not bodily autonomy... simple
It's a surprise tool that will help them later. Besides, they've made it clear that the state owns your body.
In most places. Interesting fact, Alabama is an anomaly setting their age of majority at 19 for some reason.
So-- fun fact. Abortion rights aren't the only thing lost by overturning roe v wade.

The decision made last year over ruled abortion rights that were originally decided by roe v wade, but at the core of roe v wade was the right to privacy in thr 14th amendment that determined that the right to privacy included that between patients and doctors for their medical care. With the overturning of roe v wade-- that right to privacy between patients and their physicians is no longer protected. 

Theoretically, roe v wade could have been used as an example in a court case. One could have sue against the bills banning gender affirming care past the age of 18 by arguing that--as decided in roe v wade, and as per the 14th amendment right to privacy-- those bills are unconstitutional as it implies the invasion of my medical privacy by the government.

But roe v wade has been overturned which means that not *only* does that protection not exist, but the court has already ruled that the decision saying that the right to privacy as written in the 14th amendment does not apply to these doctor/patient relationships. 

Now. I am not huge on policy--so this is my full extent of knowledge about the subject in the realm of policy. But it boils my blood.

It feels really hopeless.

But I will add: a lot of very important change happens at the local level, and LGBTQ representation in law and policy and in local government is improving all the time.

And that feels a little more hopeful.. I dont know. 

Thanks for coming to my TEDtalk.
BBL is the most dangerous cosmetic elective surgery at 1 in 3000 resulting in a death. But it's definitely not the most lethal surgery by a long shot.
In America, the age to drink is 21, assuming they‚Äôre basing it off thar
Exactly
18 is also old enough to be FORCED to go to war during a draft as well. Rebulicans don‚Äôt care about the youth they just want to kill trans people
17*
More like in progress. Moletovs and guns should solve the problem of the right wing real quick tho
We need to start playing their own game, stoop down to their level, use the media to push out flashy eye catching titles to confuse the general public, either that or choose the nuclear option
Do I hear arson? üëÄüî•
I grew up there and it was depressing being a trans kid in South Dakota.  Best wishes, im sorry man
Utah did this?! I live here wtf
Missouri is hearing 8 anti-trans bills today. Yes, eight in a single day! People were lined out the door to testify against and they are not even allowing them to speak!
People always say this shit gets the worst right before acceptance but it sure doesn't feel like it
Because we are scary‚Ä¶
I get your point but that's probably not the best quote to use, as MLK was actually against riots and other violent forms of protest. He only said that to warn the government that things would inevitably escalate if they kept oppressing black people

Edit: [source](https://brittanytalissaking.medium.com/dr-kings-riots-are-the-voice-of-the-unheard-quote-is-always-used-out-of-context-7b688a3d51d0)
Of course they wouldn't fix actual problems, because *they're* the problem
Don't forget about the truck convoy that was literally funded by US Republicans. Ruining their own country isn't enough, they wanna ruin ours too. American conservatism is a plague. I have hope though, our conditions would have to decline pretty low and pretty rapidly to reach the level of fascism in The States rn, like I'd totally reccomend a trans person move to Canada over The States (just pick a good province)
I mean, religious people always like controlling what others do, so yeah.
Not really all that new, just a new application. Same idea as charging a 16 yo who sent their BF a boob pic with crimes against children (themself).
America
Not whole world
I can understand this take for battleground states, but in deep red states, voting *doesn't* matter. For the foreseeable future, there's going to be a republican governor. And most likely, there's going to be a republican governor who is deeply against trans people existing. There is no choice there. I live in a state where my rights, and the rights of everyone around me were up in the air (Wisconsin) so I voted to protect my freedoms, but trying to claim Mississippi can vote their way out of this right now is like saying that people aren't shoveling water out of a lake fast enough to clear the water.
Fuck off
unfortunately to them it isnt medicine it's disfigurement
We are the only ones who can save ourselves
also infant circumcision.
The anti trans kids law passed? I can't remember if it did or not
According to the united nations this is legally genocide but apparently ""oh no girl with pp scary"" us a valid excuse for them
This bill died in committee in feb 2022 just after being released.
I‚Äôve been looking into the citizenship process as of late, luckily I live in a very safe state so I have extra time
I‚Äôm actually seriously considering moving to Vancouver. I live in California and everything so far is ok, but if shit goes south I‚Äôm out. I can‚Äôt claim residency to a class of people that would seek to destroy the entire country for some sort of sick and demented personal gain. Vile, disgusting people in office and should be removed forcefully by any means necessary. Doesn‚Äôt seem like there is any other way at this point.
Context from the article linked:

In Mississippi, a gender affirming care ban under the age of 18 just passed their state house by a 78-28 margin.

&#x200B;

So a ban has already been put in place for under 18s, and now they're starting the process of raising that limit
I feel awful and I don't even live in America.
If they‚Äôre vague enough, they can even jail counselors who don‚Äôt immediately tell trans kids to conform to their sex at birth.
It is, but they seem to have blatantly ignored that fact. And you can‚Äôt ban legal adult consent. The US Supreme Court is going to have a field day with all these idiots.
TBF, he's my #1 100% absolute favorite currently-sitting right-of-center president.
Violence is almost always morally wrong and tactically short sighted. Transphobes seem insistent on testing that almost.
I understand that furry, but an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth makes the whole world blind and toothless. A lot of the people making these laws are old as shit and voting away a lot of elder care as well so in a decade, which is way too long, most of them will keel over and die and we can piss on their graves
Are you aware that puberty affects bodies in a major way? Why is it preferable to force kids through a puberty they don't want rather than to let them take hormone blockers?

Or hell - given the tiny detransition rate (and even tinier rate of detransitioners who actually changed how they identify), isn't it more responsible to assist a kid who's asking for transition, given that they're less likely to regret it than they are to regret normal puberty?
You are trying to use sound logic, they only understand buzz words, catchphrases, and flashy sentences. Like: Mississippi law is killing your kids!? Maybe! Groomer! Groomer! America good! Killing kids bad! America shouldn‚Äôt kill the kids! USA! USA! USA! Mississippi is being very unpatriotic and unchristian! They worship Satan! It‚Äôs full of groomers!
Idk any other way. Let's get together and do it
No, riots disrupt work and cause a bad name for yourselves. Although I can see the appeal, but riots are not the solution.
Did Jan 6 do something ?
Are you suggesting to use honesty and good faith... *in politics?*
Yep. To the right of Conservatism...is Fascism. They disdain the idea of a free Democracy with women having the same rights as men, the LGBTQ+ community being allowed to exist, and other religions being practiced. They just want an extremely strict Christian fascist state where all of the above is impossible to obtain. We are being led by actual demons and horrible and vile people.
State rights, like the right to control their citizens with an iron fist.
Sort of. There are no laws protecting abortion access and the Dobbs decision basically said that you can‚Äôt use the 14th amendment for that purpose or similar purposes (gay, interracial marriage etc). 

We have laws that protect medical privacy with HIPAA at the federal level. 

https://www.cdc.gov/phlp/publications/topic/hipaa.html
I‚Äôm sure they meant most lethal cosmetic surgery
Yep.
Really, they allow 17-year-olds in the armed forces?   Wow.
Molotovs are very easy to make.

Ive been thinking of moving to CAN in case if emergency. I currently live in the PNW and BC/Yukon would be where Id preferably like to live if i move up there. Would yall recommend those two as pretty safe in terms of trans/lgbt policies and communities?
Did you not read the title where it said the UK, this isn't just happening in America. Not only in America and not only in the UK but all over the world because there's always going to be pretentious pricks out there
People specifically claimed the SCOTUS nominations didn't matter, gave trump 3 appointments, and the landscape that allows these states to pass these laws without fear they would be struck down.

It all matters. 40% of people do not vote.
I meant like, medicine in general, and this includes stuff like abortion and birth control.   But I get your point.   Abortion and birth control aren't medicine either. They are murder...
No, it never became law. It was an order from abbott, but it was deemed unconstitutional.
I would breathe a sign of relief if it were not for the fact that these bills keep popping back up and getting more extreme. It‚Äôs like people are becoming numb to how ludicrous these laws are.
Proper opsec comrade! Get close to your local JBGC and other leftist organizations. Wear black and try not to bring your phone to protests. Big things are going to happen this year üéáüéÜ
I would like to remind you that Stonewall was a riot.
I guess that‚Äôs why people don‚Äôt like lgbtq people‚Ä¶ because of the riot stonewall
Jan 6 was less a riot and more an insurrection. Riots are about property damage and loss of capitol as that‚Äôs the only language the rich will respond too‚Ä¶ and thats not what really happened on jan 6th. Check out the vice documentary on what happened for more. Look at france if you want to see riots working, or simply at the history of the working class here in america.
I mean Jan 6th did do ""something"" only it wasnt very good

EDIT: JESUS HOW DID I MISS THAT TYPO

Can we just send them all out to space and nuke ‚Äòem? They deserve for sure
Well there's a right to medical privacy-- hipaa--- but I mean the right to live private lives--which includes nut is not limited  to Medical decision making. The decision/argument was that the 14th ammendment prohibited the government from mpeding on your ability to live your life as you see fit on private matters (such as marriage. Family planning decisions. Medical bodily decisions. Etc.)
Yeah, too young for the draft obviously, but you can willingly enlist at 17
Yes. I went to Basic Training with the Aur Force at the age of 17 in 2008. I graduated HS, then a week later, was at BMT, graduated that, and was halfway through my technical school before I turned 18. It's surprisingly common. You need both parents to sign off on it, though.
We didn‚Äôt start the fire. It was always burning since the worlds been turning
Yessss
Maybe, but I got the impression you were trying to say that MLK would approve of rioting in a situation like this, which is why I wanted to clarify.

But then again, you're not MLK and neither am I, so...
BC, Vancouver is a decent place. It's just very expensive to live. I unfortunately don't know much about Yukon, but I may look into it. I'd like to move from my province eventually as it is more conservative, and this Danielle Smith person isn't giving me much hope, but it really depends on where work is for me.
UK should specifically say England, Scotland is doing the opposite with England trying to block it (and fuelling independence more)
Okay, you are delusional
US and UK and then a lot of Asia(there are exceptions) is not okay. 
Australia and New Zealand is okay, most of Europe is okay. 
Baltics have it harder .
Scandinavia has it regulated as a lot of EU countries. 
Africa is cluster fuck but that was always in everything medical, religious or anything because they are poor. 
It's probably half world to be precise and in EU it's improving every day even more.
Canada is okay.
Don't know about rest of countries in American continents.
Brazil probably bad.

This was just typed out from my head how I recalled it so it's possibly not 100% accurate.
I'm on toilet with phone.
I agree that voting is important, house seats could flip, state assemblies etc. And I think that as more of the older generations pass, there's going to be a noticeable shift to the left in the coming years. But there's a time and place for conversations like this. Your original comment comes off as dismissive and like victim blaming when the reality is that even if every trans person and every ally in Mississippi voted, this probably still would have happened.
Thank goodness
Big things SHOULD happen but they probably won't because any direct action we take gives conservatives fuel against us. Unless we literally just start slaughtering Nazis en masse we're never going to see the end of this.
That person isn't even trans and posts on the MRA sub. They're a right wing troll.
How can we look back to stonewall and apply that today to help fight against these laws? I mean this genuinely because I want to do something but idk enough about history and politics.
people hated lgbt people way before stonewall
I thought the place got kinda trashed tho?
I wish we could, but, unfortunately, rockets are expensive to make. Arming yourselves is probably the next best alternative.
I knew two things at 17 and they haven‚Äôt changed in 36 years.  

1) I wanted desperately to be a woman - but I knew that by the time I was 5. 

2) I knew I didn‚Äôt want to go overseas to prosecute some proxy war for the likes of Ronald Regan or George H.W. Bush.
Nah
Well I hope you make it off the toilet! Id hate for you to get stuck with a case of Jell-O legs‚Ä¶
>in EU it's improving every day even more

I don't wanna be a party pooper but [this](https://youtu.be/xelzOxcpWNM) is the newly elected Italian PM
I appreciate your perspective.  I have not blamed victims at all.  Much of this was predicted and I have a hard time with what opportunities were lost.  Trans people were thrown under the bus, along with a lot of vulnerable people, by those who calculated they could weather the chaos. It's sad.
That doesn‚Äôt mean they‚Äôre not trying to make it happen again. Paxton recently requested a list of all people in Texas who are transitioning. Somehow that‚Äôs not protected data.
I saw that they had a pretty ghastly history and such, but I must have missed some of the nastier bits. Thank you!
Street level violence and protests against excessive use of force and application of predatory laws towards us would be a start. Quiet, dignified protests rarely draw eyes or opinions to the stated issues, or even media coverage. People start coming out of pocket though and it‚Äôs all eyes on.
I‚Äôm using their logic against them
it did. 1.5 million dollars worth of damage. but that wasnt the point of the insurrection. The point was to stage a coup for Donald Trump.
I think the only actual solution is for us to come together and united politically, as a global community. Supporting our cause through solidarity. The second we start breaking stuff all we're gonna hear on fox news is essentially ""we were right, they are a violent ideology that's coming after average Americans""
>Arming yourselves is probably the next best alternative.

The only thing I've ever agreed with conservatives on. People have the right to arm themselves with whatever their heart desires.

Besides: I dream of the day I can walk into a crowded public space in a predominantly Republican area wearing thigh-highs, a miniskirt, a *very* noticeable bulge, and a Barret .50cal with a trans pride paintjob strapped to my back.
[removed]
I agree, it is really sad. It is my hope that as time moves on, tradition will lose its power and influence, and acceptance and compassion will replace it. But maybe I'm just hopeful things can change for the better.
I'll be joining that list soon
What kind of protest can we do? Violence is a crime
Rookie numbers compared to if you go in trying for it.
that‚Äôs all we‚Äôre going to hear no matter what. No media corporation is on our side. The revolution will not be televised.
They said that same shit when MLK did nonviolent protests, you think it‚Äôll be any different this time??
This is definitely not the space for jokes but I wanna make this one so BAD!!!! Can I have your bulge pls?
I want to get a crossbow and also a mini crossbow ü§∑
I don't think that we should, just only in circumstances that our physical safety is being threatened at the moment. Killing bigots willy nilly will only validate their claims of the LGBTQ+ community of being dangerous. The aim should be tearing down harmful systems, not to commit violence against people.
Congratulations for making those steps! Not for being on a list held by a bigot.

It‚Äôs rough. Be safe, girl. üíúüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Stop the traffic, massive pickets outside of legislative buildings, those sorts of things would be a good start. The violence would only be defensive or retaliatory in the event violence is visited upon us. The right laughs when the PBs or other hate groups harm us, they‚Äôll be much less likely to throw at ‚Äúdefenseless‚Äù protesters if a few of the starters get free dental work and hospital supervised naps. But we‚Äôve also got to overcome our own internal politics and gatekeeping as well. We cannot allow transmedicalists or the like to dictate the way in which we all are represented or spoken of, as they hold a minority perspective within our own communities.
Lol the Jan 6th insurrection reminded me of a dog chasing a car. Once they finally charged the front steps and got inside everyone was like ""Now what? Do we... take things? Fuck it Imma take that flag poll over there. That'll show em!"" They were incited to make noise without a plan or any clear goal.

But a group of people who's anger comes not from a news channel but from real and personal mistreatment? Yea we'd probably end up burning shit to the ground and dancing on the ashes.
exactly
I mean this is an incredibly valid point
Is it true that the media really has no ""good"" coverage for you guys?
Another valid point
I guess my retort would be to ask if a more militant approach like Malcom's was more successful in creating social change than MLKs peaceful solutions
Lol I'm assuming so you can have one for yourself? Sorry, but I like my thick gock. It's been good to me, and although HRT was a little confusing for it at first it's now starting to bounce back with a rather fierce feminine vengeance.

~~Unless you meant you wanted my bulge in the other way. If that's the case then you need to buy me breakfast first ;)~~

**Edit:** I didn't see the ace flag until now. Sorry about that.
How are we supposed to do that without violence? I feel like at this stage it‚Äôs genocide them completely or be genocided completely
My very lukewarm counter to that is they're already treating us like we're dangerous. Without the threat of violence they know they can act with impunity. Because what else are we going to do? Ask nicely that they treat us better? They don't even see us as humans.

We should tear down the systems, but bloodying some noses would get them to think twice.
Thank you, good luck to you too
Pretty much. All major media outlets in the US is either openly fascist or capital-L Liberals who will ""debate"" whether or not we deserve to exist, and will happily platform even the worst transphobes for those debates, but will rarely ever platform trans people. And they deliberately run non-stories that they know will go viral with transphobes, because money, even if those stories are false. See the story from the other week about the cis woman who claimed she cried because she saw a penis in the locker room at a YMCA, only for it to come out later that the trans woman in question has a vagina and the first woman made the whole thing up.
Obviously it's impossible to say what specifically swayed people, but the duality of approaches basically sent the message that ""hey, we're trying to ask nicely, but this is a matter of life and death for us and we will resort to liberating ourselves through violence if you don't stop oppressing us."" I think it's also worth noting that the civil rights act wasn't passed until after MLK was assassinated and there were nationwide riots until Congress finally got enough votes to pass it.
It‚Äôs perfectly fine
Attend pro-lgbtq+ rallies and protests, donate to pro-lgbtq+ organizations, defend lgbtq+ people online and in real life, support pro-lgbtq+ politicians and bills, support the community, etc. There's a ton of cishet allies and ordinary people disgusted by this genocide who want to help. You just have to convince those on the brink of wanting to support the community to...support the community. Violence doesn't build a community.
[removed]
As much as we would like to, the law is, unfortunately, on their side. You can bloody some noses in self-defense, though. Hell, I honestly believe that this rise in Christian Nationalism may actually spark some kind of revolution, and in that case, if bloodying some noses will lead to the replacement of a cruel system with a more kinder one, so be it. I am just saying that it would be unwise to commit violent acts against these groups who can abuse democracy to have you arrested.
Thank you. I‚Äôve been on HRT for three years. Despite living in Lubbock, I‚Äôve been fortunate enough to not deal with any major backlash in that time. I still watch my back, as does my wife (cis). I, of course, watch hers.
We‚Äôve doing this for years and it didn‚Äôt prevent the current situation
It 100% is genocide. They‚Äôre trying to stop people from medically transitioning, heck even socially at this point they are disgusting and they will stop at nothing to destroy us. End of story!

Why do you think they accuse us of being pedophiles? it‚Äôs to give ordinary right wing people the motive to destroy us.

# GENOCIDE
They're already committing acts of violence against us and the law will protect us as much as cops want to protect us. Its safe to call it self defense if it makes you feel better
That's nice I wish you are forever happy with your wife
I understand your frustrations that it isn't working but if you look closer you can see change before all these laws started happening.These laws are coming up because they are scared of how far we have come.People were coming out more often, more companies started supporting us.Esty, TikTok, ebay started having more LGBT+ creators & ally's.The non-violence approach is working because the other side has nothing on us. If we start to be violent all that will do is give them something to use against us. To be fair we need to do stuff that is more impactful than what we are currently doing but that doesn't mean we need to be violent.
[removed]
I appreciate it! After nearly a decade we‚Äôre still crazy about each other, so I think we‚Äôre safe. 

Have a good night, sister. Welcome to the party!
I agree up to a point. But if they literally were to arrest me for being trans, I think I would choose violence. I'd probably die, and it would probably accomplish nothing, but I won't simply let myself be taken.
I see one single non-violent way of getting rid of the root of the problem. We make sure kids have no bigoted influences in school and have age verification on bigoted content. We teach kids the importance of their impact on society and how lgbt+ people aren‚Äôt evil or scary and help them be better than the conservatives. We help them learn to be good. It‚Äôs long haul but it‚Äôs the best we‚Äôve got to fully end the problem
Driving trans people to suicide is genocide, just secondhand genocide. They don‚Äôt need to kill us directly to genocide us. Trying to hide a group from society is also genocide or trying to drive them to suicide.

*cough* genocide *cough*
Thank you
Honestly, it would be completely understandable to choose violence in that scenario, as it's self-defense and not done unprovoked.
OK fine you win its just I thought I had a better term for it.

uhhoh Utah trans kids your in trouble		"As someone who lives here in Utah and is following this closely, I am infuriated that in the committee meeting, they (the bill sponsors) brought in a detransitioner from out of state to ‚Äúbring in a different perspective of the dangers of kids transitioning‚Äù for supporting the given bill(s)
Fucking pure evil
The man even looks like a villain. An evil, transphobic ferret. I used to live in Utah and I‚Äôm sending all my love to you guys- stay strong!
I wish there were things we could do, but I feel like we aren't doing enough... our rights are being taken away, and people will die because of these laws! Why does it feel like no one is doing anything!?
Vote.

Never not vote.
i hate this country
Make your voices heard. Keep voting and protest if you fucking have to. Don‚Äôt let these pieces of shit walk all over us.
This is so sad. This is how they are going to try and eradicate trans people as they know that this will kill so many trans people and they don‚Äôt even have to lift a finger. Then these sick people will hide behind the kids that they hurt claiming that they are only trying to protect the kids.
Fucking garbage ppl who support this bill
Fuck Utah.
(My parents are Mormon, I'm agnostic)
Mormons‚Ä¶the greatest cause of LGBT suicide in Utah.
Same shit going on in WV. These GOP are pandering to their homophobic/transphobic constituents- It's bullshit.
Next they‚Äôll blame adult trans people for the existence of trans kids, ban being trans in public, arrest people for existing, and start mass murdering them in the jails.
I live in Utah and I'm so fucking mad how little news coverage there's been, they're so close to taking our rights away and no one even knows
I've had to tell every trans person i know and that really sucks
My family's finally ready to support my transition and this happens.
Absolutely disgusting that these bigots think they k own better than the entire medical community.
Why does nothing seem to work‚Ä¶ at this point it doesn‚Äôt even seem like life is worth it. I might as well give up and hope I get something better wherever I go after death
It‚Äôs getting more clear, we can‚Äôt keep letting this happen, it‚Äôs just going to get worse and they‚Äôre going to keep pushing boundaries the more anti-trans bills they can push around. We need to arm ourselves and band together, let our voices be heard and teach. These anti-trans people think we‚Äôre delusional, they think we are out of touch with science because of big mouths spreading lies and hate. We need to come together and organize ourselves to fight back and protest
Republicans are monsters plain and simple
america stop taking away human rights challenge (impossible)
Utah will actively be contributing to the death of many kids. Parents with trans kids need to move!!
This hits so home. My afab son attends LDS church meetings with me every week, with the full support of his local church leaders. Meanwhile, some of the people sitting next to him support laws like this.

A house divided against itself cannot stand üò™
Fucking bigamists
As a pacifist it is hard for me to say things like this, but we need to make our voices heard.  The only way we can do this and get media attention to carry our point to American living rooms is through civil disobedience, discourse when possible and violence when all else fails.

You are a target.  Move before you can be killed.  Return fire.

Do what you must and fucking slay as you do.  To the streets my sisters and brothers!
Why do some still call America ""The land of the free"", when it clearly fucking is not!
I live in north ogden and this bill passing has encouraged me to pay attention to local politics. I'm going to this months city council meeting on tuesday the 24 and I'm gonna keep going until I can trust this city. Maybe one day with enough pressure the city can influnce the state but it starts with this girl getting involved

What age range are they targeting? I‚Äôm trying to get hrt in salt lake rn
I‚Äôm so so so fucked my mom for the past few months has been planning to move to Utah I thought it would be better than the state I‚Äôm currently in but guess not
I swear when these monsters start hurting children worse than they already have been we need a God damn civil war. This is all going too far and it's clearly genocide. Republicans are truly enemies of America and civilization in general. I just want you to imagine how much de-transitioning a person would damage them. This is pure evil.
I don't understand how the United States, a country that's supposed to be a symbol of liberty and justice for all, can still discriminate people like this.

With laws like this put in place, Germany, the country that was once under the most oppressive regime in history, currently has more freedom than the United States, a country who helped defeat the Nazis during the Second World War. America should be no place for laws like this!
At this point I‚Äôm just going to brake the law and be myself fuck it  I don‚Äôt care anymore fuck this country
i am not from there but...

I made a petition, there's still time since the house hasn't passed it so please sign
And my mom wonders why I told her ""fuck no"" when she asked me If I wanted to visit our family friend who lives in Utah. Utah should be blocked off from the rest of the world.

I don't want to starve them out I just want them to feel what it's like to be treated like shit.

And of course, I would bus out all the LGBT people, their supportive families/friends and anyone else with an IQ higher than 12.
Its so dystopian this world we live in were its okay to ban healthcare and life saving Medicine just bc u dont like someon
Guess I‚Äôm never moving back
Just wanted to add a comment as a mostly straight man who is 100% an LGBTQ ally. Please don't let all this horrible politics tear you down and give up on yourselves. Please be who you are, and love who you are. Never let them take that away. The media makes it out to be so horrible and I KNOW it's dangerous believe me im not downplaying that side of it and I HATE the violence that is being whipped up but please stay true to yourselves if you can. This really sucks that they want to rip apart the country on you guys but please know it is not all bad out there. If you can get the hell out of a place that's  oppressive, and move to a better place, please do. Im middle aged so when I was in high school, basically all gay kids were in the closet. One of my BEST FRIENDS from high school is gay, and he hid it so well I never suspected until he finally told me in our 20s. It's just how it was back then. There wasn't an option really to talk about it where we lived; the school and kids would have eaten him alive for his orientation. But once he came out, he learned that he had several friends who backed him 100%. I watched times change, and things progress as I've grown older. I watched gay marriage get legalized and I celebrated, because my foster parents growing up (not legally, literally took me in off the street) were gay.  Because I was the one who took one of them to the hospital when the other had a heart attack and guess what? They wouldnt let him back to see him because ""they weren't family"" ... they had been together over 20 years... but laws prevented them from marriage. I sat there with him balling on me because they did that to him. Then things got better. Now they are slipping back again. How far back, none of us know. But please... Don't let anyone tell you who you are or can or can't love. Don't let anyone tell you you are a 'mental illness' Its all gaslighting and degrading.  Love you all, stay strong.
HAHAHA I LIVE IN FUCKING RUSSIA WHERE NO ONE THINKS TRANS PEOPLE EXIST SO YOU CAN JUST WALK INTO A PHARMACY AND BUY TESTOSTERONE WITH NO QUESTIONS ASKED (Fr tho I'm so sorry for anyone who lives in Utah. Teenagers should be allowed the same care as adults, and not providing it can be life threatening. Stay safe trans kids in Utah!)

It‚Äôs reassuring to know state assemblies and senates are tackling the big issues like this head on and so decisively rather than things like say, high rates of [domestic abuse](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/utah-2021101912193567.pdf) or the fact that [1 in 5 women will be raped in her lifetime](https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-news/1-5-u-s-women-raped-during-their-lifetimes-cdc-n198496). There are [165,328,000 women in the US](https://www2.census.gov/programs-surveys/demo/tables/age-and-sex/2019/age-sex-composition/2019gender_table1.xlsx), divide that by 5 and you have 33,065,600 (20% of women) women who are or will be raped.  1 in 4 girls and 1 in 13 boys are or will be sexually assaulted ([source](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/childsexualabuse/fastfact.html)). 

[The leading cause of death in children is now guns](https://www.forbes.com/sites/ninashapiro/2022/04/18/the-leading-cause-of-death-in-children-and-youths-is-now-guns/?sh=18ad9d811705).  Where‚Äôs the quick decisive action to change that?  I mean, they keep talking about how they are SO worried about the children. 

There are 1.6 million transgender people in this country( .06%) of which a portion are minors.  Here‚Äôs a [source](https://www.hli.org/resources/number-of-transgenders-in-the-united-states/) backing that up from a conservative site. THIS is their big call to action? Man are they solving the ills besetting our nation.  They won‚Äôt erase trans people, they can deny us care, force us to hide, lock us away but we will still be trans.  The only difference will be the state-sanctioned abuse of us.
My girlfriend lives in Utah :(
I live in Kentucky and I‚Äôm honestly surprised I have not seen a big anti transgender bill here.
he looks like he sucks toes
I guess I know how to use my vote as a Utah citizen now.
It's Utah...

The longest week of my life was the day I spent in Salt Lake City. If a kid (minor) wants rights in UT, move to Oregon or Washington state.
A politicians job is to get elected...nothing else.
So, they couldn't find a Utahan detransitioner who was willing to come support their bill, and they had to fly someone in from out of state. So, who is this supposed to be for?
They‚Äôre about to do the same thing in Wyoming along with about 7 other anti-trans bills right now.
I really wish less then 1% of the U.S. population wasn't a political football right now..
I know where I‚Äôm never living
Honestly, we need some of the children of Mormons to leave the state and refuse to return unless the law is struck down. That‚Äôll kill this quick. Especially if it‚Äôs a prominent family.

Utah Senate Permanently Hobbles Trans Kids' lives by Denying Them Healthcare at a critical time.  Lawsuit in 20 years.  That's my thought.  They're making this personal.  Make it personal back at them.  They're INTERFERING with your healthcare based on LIES and are so arrogant they REFUSE to listen to the truth.  That sounds like lawsuit material to me.
Just a preview of what federal legislators will do in 2024 when they inevitably hold house senate and presidency. This is what happens when the other team just keeps telling progressives ‚Äúwe will make change next election just vote blue no matter who‚Äù alienating them.. and ontop of that keep talking about banning a hobby for a large chunk of moderates and centrist alienating them as well.

both the states' ""expert"" witnesses were not from our state nor did they have any medical back ground. the dr they had was a phd of poly sci, from a republican think tank. 

then there was the whole section they had in the bill about cannabis! like wtf?!

i think the worst part for me is when senator kennedy was unwilling to listen to medical groups and doctors from our state but instead that they need to find new unbiased studies, cause the old ones were biased.
I don't mind detransitioners.  I can understand how that mistake might be made, as rare as it is.  However, I do mind the fuckers that take that experience and use it to attack trans people.
Let me guess, there were no actual trans people at that meeting, right? God, I hate living here, it's already bad enough for LGBT kids, now it'll be even worse

You think no alternative perspectives should be offered? 

Sounds kinda fascist, especially when a dramatically increasing number of people‚Äôs lives have been ruined by mental misdiagnoses caused by the affirmation-only model. 

Stay in your echo chamber as long as you need, tho.
His face looks very punchable.
Don‚Äôt do ferrets like that :(
He absolutely is. Interestingly a lot of his private practice relies on evolvedMD for mental diagnoses. Unfortunately, while they claim to support GAC for minors they continue to do business with this guy. In my conversations with them, they seem to be willing to look past the fact that he is undoing what they claim to support.
Because in reality we‚Äôre mostly powerless to do anything truly significant. We can vote sure, we can protest sure, but will anybody actually listen and change things? Probably not. We‚Äôre in the spotlight of being demonized and the only ones who have our backs is us. It‚Äôs hopeless. We just have to survive somehow.
Arm yourself! If they‚Äôre going to come toward us with violence, we must be ready to defend ourselves and our community. A lot of conservatives miss that the point of the second amendment (and bill of rights as a whole) was to defend us from government overreach!
Because we‚Äôre in, unfortunately, one of those civilization turning points where everything is going to get worse for a while for no dammed reason but greed and very human evils. 

It‚Äôs disgusting, but I think now is the time for trans folk to ban together. Not to fight the government but to save each other and the people we love. 

I‚Äôve become a bit of a separationist and I don‚Äôt like it, but these Christian cultists will eventually use their newfound power on the federal level. With the system so broken, I think our focus should be building structures of support for our own, and only dealing with outside forces as little as possible unless you are far enough along to have truly healed before you start fighting. I say that because the collective trauma in our community is extremely high. 

I don‚Äôt mean to be a downer, but more to say that I truly think the most powerful thing you can do to be ‚Äúenough‚Äù is to just let yourself be enough for you. 

The imperial powers that be want your attention and your life for their profit. I‚Äôm just electing to play as little as possible because I don‚Äôt like being forced to play with a gun to my head.
Go into government! We need more regular people there! That is something you can do if you‚Äôre up for it
Even if you don't think it will work, it doesn't matter! Vote anyway and vote like your life depends on it because it does and will soon.
dont end your activism at voting either
100% I have a lot of anarchists friends who don‚Äôt vote and it infuriates me. No wonder the side they hate keeps winning if they do nothing about it.
We're so far beyond that shit.  A vote for leftists is a slap in the face to right-wing pieces of shit.  The time for voting is behind us.  It's time to wake up and quit participating in a reality show and take our fight to the fucking streets.

Utah is gerrymandered to hell. Salt Lake City (the most populated and left-leaning city) is split up into 4 separate districts. Like yeah, vote, but also there‚Äôs quite a bit of limitation here. Republicans just win because the districts are structured for them to.

Same. I'm stuck here. Luckily not in the same house as my hyper religious Mormon parents anymore, but I have a trans cousin under 18 who's directly harmed by this. It just makes me sick. They go around praising the country for being the mostest free ever and their religion the most loving and accepting, but then turn around and hate and pass laws demanding people follow their horrible standards. (sorry. I have a lot pent up emotion living in this state built on a foundation of lies and gaslighting)

I don‚Äôt want to see the community and the people I love have the target on their back grow more and more. This is getting dangerous. Once they‚Äôre done attacking the trans youth they WILL go for Trans adults. The youth don‚Äôt have much power, it‚Äôs easier for them to target them because they can‚Äôt vote, many can‚Äôt protest simply because it‚Äôs dangerous or school. We need to protect them and their future üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è

After the trans community they will continue and target the rest of the LGBTQIA+ community.
""America needs a strong republican party"" Nancy Pelosi.  


And democrats are their enablers.
I respectfully disagree. Republicans (claim to) want a smaller government. This is an example of government overreach. I mean, personally, I‚Äôd be more than happy to have a tiny government, but that would mean low/no restraints on mega-corporations, discrimination, gun ownership.

Tl;dr it‚Äôs not Republicans, it‚Äôs those discriminatory motherfuckers who align with the GOP just for the easy votes because average Republicans generally have less education.

Good. I've seen so many kids' lives destroyed by the church. Somethings should be allowed to *fall*.

Even the most ""understanding"" temples are still places where reasoning, questioning and any curious spirit go to die. And heaven forbid you be gay or trans.

Your temple might ""not be like this""... So are ""not all men!"" It's enough of them.

They're Mormons, they don't care, they'll threaten excommunication on anyone who even breathes in a way they don't like, and since Utah is run by the LDS church and has it's fingers in everything, getting excommunicated can find you cut off from a lot of things, your own family is even supposed to pretend you don't exist anymore

Your campaign doesn‚Äòt even include how, when and to whom you will hand it over?   
Your local pro-lgbt political groups can probably help you make a more effective one.
Because [Kentucky has comprehensive non-discrimination laws in place](https://freedomforallamericans.org/category/ky/) for a couple of years already.   

Utah is not as well covered, leaving plenty of space to attack people‚Äòs rights.
What‚Äôs confusing you? Minors (people under age 18) are being denied medical treatment for GD.
this is messed up so much, I'm a trans child. If this law became effective in my state (I don't live in utah) I would have to come off hormones and I don't know what I would do

A possible exception is that if the person is so severely dysphoric that they have severe suicidal thoughts, because then yeah they most likely won‚Äôt regret it.
ah yes, Cis-normativity üôÑ
minors have to go through extensive medical and psychological counseling before even getting close to HRT. maybe keep your opinions to yourself.
You cannot make blant hard limits for medical treatments for everyone like that, by slapping an arbitrary age on it.  
Human bodies are diverse and we don‚Äòt develop equally.  
Medical treatment needs to be closely fit to the person who needs it. Anything else will cause needles suffering.   

This is how it‚Äòs currently recommended and should stay, a bunch of doctors evaluates and observes a kid with dysphoria and makes a decision based on said kids body and mind together with their parents.   
Research indicates very high success rates like. Instead of totally backpedaling on a successfull treatment, it should be further improved upon.
they aren't protecting anyone
anti trans laws
thank God for what
Basically the same that is always recommended:   
become politically active and reach out to your local community (as well as lgbt+ community). 

Contact politicians (look up who votes on it, also who of those will oppose a bad bill and can use your support) and tell them that you disagree with a certain bill. Put pressure on them. Contact your local politicians to put pressure on those who will directly vote on that bill.  

Support those fighting the bill.  
That doesn‚Äòt just mean protests or online campaigns, it means support good politicians in your area, support ngo groups and lgbt+ groups who are politically active or provide support for those affected by laws.  

Look up if any people/ law firms are getting ready to fight this legally and if they can be supported in any way. (Like Lambda Legal).   

Talk with people.  
Just express your feelings, for example casually at work, talk to neighbors, family members, friends.
sure‚Ä¶ and they‚Äôll be asking how we as a country allowed this genocide.
Good news is that there are [plenty of new studies with clear results](https://medium.com/transgender-soapbox/believing-trans-kids-isnt-the-same-as-grooming-them-184bc62624c5?sk=2c908ea4e8d0e89dc96e24bc9f4361dc): believe trans kids.

The research linked above studied kids as young as 3-12. So the conservatives also can no longer be like ""but what about the youngest and most vulnerable."" 

Obv conservatives can just be like uhh but those studies are biased or whatever, but it brings me comfort to now be able to tell people like this to STFU. The studies are done. The research is clear. Believe trans kids and give them the medical treatment they deserve.
Most detransitioners do so because of lack of support, financial problems, mental health problems, etc. More than 90% are actually trans, but the moment they do transphobic groups go and convince them into thinking they were groomed into it and that they finally got out of it.
puberty blockers are reversible hun, and stop ""irreversible"" damage from occurring from bio puberty. Estrogen/Testorone isn't given until 16, no 10 year old is getting hormones
u can get tattoos and piercings with parent permission lol
If we really wanted to go that way, we should at least let trans kids get blockers.  At least that would prevent AGAB puberty from doing ""irreversible damage"".
and I would have to come off hormones it says in the bill that doctors can not prescribe hormones to anyone under 18
*nose *kickable
stonewall was a riot. might be time for another party
It would be really fucking nice if the Harry Potter actors who have decried JKR‚Äôs transphobia would partner with a trans advocacy group and provide grants to families who need to move out of state, support trans-friendly political candidates, etc.
the problem is that lgbt people in the US trust the democratic party to be on their side...
Talk about not having freedom of speech
In getting the feeling that things are getting worse at the moment, because a lot of conservative pieces of garbage see the world rapidly changing into a direction they don‚Äôt agree with and try to throw what is left of their weight around in order to make everything fit their worldview before they (and/or their obsolete worldviews) die.
100%
I came to realize that libertarianism relies on an informed populace, which we don't have.

I listened to and read anarchists and realized that they seem to rely on an empathetic populace, which we don't have.
Yes. Do that. But also vote.
Great. Still vote. Especially in small elections. Even if you write in your vote. You can lean your picket sign against a fire hydrant outside the polling station to pick up when you come back out.
You gotta work within the system to a degree so while I agree we MUST still vote each and every time. Our votes do fucking count and we arent the GOP, we live in reality and we shall use that to our advantage!
Also vote though dipass.
You can do both.
Can we please not advocate for ignoring the power of votes? Republicans are still gonna vote and your missing vote means their votes are now worth more.
I wonder if it has occurred to any groups to organize a collective effort to occupy and take over those districts. The Tea Party did it.
That's not really easy for 95% of the American Trans population.

Sure, it's really easy if you're extremely wealthy or extremely well educated. That's it.
Don‚Äôt come here, shit sucks.
I've talked to multiple people from Canada who couldn't start hrt. Canada is not any better
Not the point and not helpful. Things are dramatically better in the states compared to a lot of countries, absolutely, 100%. 

‚Ä¶But. Things are still getting bleaker and bleaker for trans people on the daily, and things were left to be desired even before now. It‚Äôs only natural to feel dejected and upset with the state of your country.

And, for clarity purposes, i am not from the states, nor do i live there, nor have i ever.

No, we don't.  Someone's 'religion' tells them that I can't have healthcare, fuck their 'religion.'
Oh thank you for reminding me to change that, I'm very much not lesbian, I'm bi lol

There is only one party villainizing, victimizing, and scapegoating trans people. The best way to stop them is for honest upstanding people within that party to speak up against it. For all that‚Äôs required for evil to prevail is for good people to stand silently by and let it go down. Republicans gave up on limited government and have been pushing big government to advance their agenda. Stripping women of bodily autonomy, restricting the rights of trans people and the medical professionals who serve them, banning books, restricting teaching of accurate historical facts, the list goes on. There may be good and decent people who call themselves republicans or conservatives, but to stand by and let this go down really begs the question: how decent are you to be complicit in this awful travesty?
I grew up in utah
The Mormon church is worth over $100 billion, they‚Äôll cope with a few comments being thrown around about their factual history of bigamy. Stereotypes about Mormons don‚Äôt get them murdered, unlike the ones that kill trans people. 

‚ÄúRise above‚Äù what exactly? The church was founded on racist, homophobic, and misogynistic ideologies, and continues to stand by those values today - only now they‚Äôre also funding governments to do their bidding by throwing cash at them. GTFO with that ‚Äúrise above it‚Äù bs. That has never worked in the past, and it definitely isn‚Äôt going to work now. We‚Äôre being murdered and legally erased from all walks of life. There‚Äôs no such thing as rising above the hate when our lives are at risk. 

(Ex Mormon here who knows what shit the church gets up to firsthand. You don‚Äôt need to visit Utah to understand why they‚Äôre terrible)
The Mormon religion is literally based in hate. You don't have to go there to read about it
I had a friend, years ago, a blushing baby-faced young man, who was raised Mormon. He definitely had his issues, and many opinions about sex & gender that I was ‚Äúuncomfortable‚Äù with, but, in general, he was a sweet, caring fellow, trying to get away from all that & be a good person in the world. We roomed together for a short time. But, he was absolutely wracked by guilt, & extreme anxieties, confusion & fear, in most aspects of living, due to his family‚Äôs beliefs & his religious upbringing. It was difficult to witness just how much this religion had wrecked him mentally, & emotionally. It was like he was constantly on the verge of having a heart attack, due to all this religious trauma forced on him‚Ä¶

A few years ago, I found out he had died‚Ä¶ of a heart attack. He was 28.

Rest in peace, Ryan üôèü•∫
I grew up in Utah and was raised as a Mormon (exmormon now). The LDS church really does have its fingers in everything where the state is a near theocracy. The LDS church lobbies against us and promotes a toxic culture to the LGBT community. They think that acting gay and living as your authentic self when transgender are serious sins. Acting gay will get you excommunicated. Living authenticly while transgender will now get you heavily censored and there have been reports of some transgender people getting excommunicated for simply living authenticly. Getting excommunicated can effect your political aspirations in the Mormon corridor. While the LDS church is sitting on a dragons horde and is lobbying against us their influence is limited to certain areas. The LDS church is not that powerful in regards to greater powers on this world. The shunning for being excommunicated definitely happens buy it is an informal affair unlike some other high demand religions have the shunning as regular practice. For those who want to know about the Mormons and the  LGBT community I would be happy to give them information.
Fr! You bringing this to my attention by posting it has definitely impacted my choice. I‚Äôve wanted to leave this god awful place for years, but always talked myself into staying for college so I can be with family.. but this bill is just the start and I‚Äôd much rather be in a place that lets me feel safe in who I am. Family can come visit me, but staying here is becoming less and less of an option.
That‚Äôs a 2 year wait. I‚Äôm not even out yet lmao I‚Äôll have to come out NOW if I want to start hrt any time soon
Is that safe?
Omg I did not know that
I meant it as you can register for the military at 17 but can‚Äôt be trans until 18, as in like it‚Äôs absurd they have to be that old.

I think I‚Äôm good Ty üòÅ I‚Äôm willing to discuss if you‚Äôd like to try and change my mind, but the second you start talking to me like that? I‚Äôm out. Also I shouldn‚Äôt even have to say this but I‚Äôm not cis.
It‚Äôs true that we don‚Äôt develop equally, but I haven‚Äôt heard, at least, of a brain being almost fully developed at a younger age. Maybe seventeen, but still. I hold my grounds on this. There exceptions, like if that persons safety is at risk imo.

omg thank you! bookmarking!
It‚Äôs getting people to listen and put away their prejudices. These legislators will do exactly what they think will get them money and votes. They have to be persuaded that being antitrans will get them bad press and negative opinions.
Sometimes I get really baked and get anxiety about my transness (is it real? Will I regret this) and my mind gets to going but what I always remember is how I came to this point, made the decision to save myself and transition and how I discovered I was trans. And the answer is I did it by myself and kind of on accident.
I did twice for those reasons! Back on HRT now and happier than ever. Just had to move far away from my family.
Always remember that estrogen isn't a controlled substance and thus with a vpn anyone can see an out of state doctor via Telehealth and get blood work done via a lab like LabCorP. 

It sucks but we can fight this and people _can_  still get the meds they need if they are resilient. Plus there is homebrew as well.

Edit for clarity: sanctuary states like doctors in Colorado have already said they are willing to provide health care this way. ;) the VPN is just for your bigoted stares possible tracking on trans people.
As much as I do not like the idea of violence, it might be the only way we can be heard. Even the civil rights movement had riots!
Gen Z loves to play with fire so it would be even worse than the 60s We need a Gen Z version of Stonewall will be much more destructive.
It's time for us to get the bricks.

>the problem is that lgbt people in the US trust the democratic party to be on their side...

Since the Democratic party has any real pull in Utah.

No. The problem in this country was lazy fuckers who didn't want to vote in 2000, 2002, 2004, 2006, 2008, 2012, 2014 etc.

Something tells me we'd be in a different place had the democrats done better at the polls for the last 20 years.
occupy the entire state? Because those 4 districts are the only ones here. And the republican government has the support of the mormon church, which has $100 billion+ dollars in wealth and about 1/2 the state‚Äôs population are members of. 

The idea sounds great, but how realistic is it, really?
Couldn't start hrt, or were legally disallowed from obtaining hrt?
in canada the issue tends to be with doctors the first one i went to wouldnt even put me on puberty blockers when she was so insistent on putting me on e boosters when i turned 16 bc i‚Äôm afab and had a delayed puberty- the second doctor the waitlist was nearly TWO YEARS and i got put on blockers and then had to wait an extra 8 months incase i had schizophrenia? because i had minor visual hallucinations? and i went through my own psychatrist for thar eventually where i get deadnamed by the receptionist because even for one appointment for an assessment the waitlists for another was too long and my name change/gender marker change was a similar process to this shit. took FOREVER and people kept delaying it
Aussie here; can confirm that I'd *definitely* rather be living here as a trans woman than the US, and last I checked, our country wasn't collapsing. Definitely plenty of places out there that aren't nearly as bad as the US when it comes to trans rights.
I'm going to be frank with you.
I do not believe that the Mormon faith is a religion.
I fully believe that they are a cult.
My mother is a Mormon and I have told her this multiple times.
She doesn't argue with me anymore.


However, I respect you for calling it a religion that's proof that some people know when to walk away.
Oh üò≠üò≠ well happy to help in any form
Bold of you to call it a religion.
It may be our only option here soon.
Yeah pretty safe. Only hard part is ordering from probably outside of your country. Check out r/transdiy
‚Äúfuckin hate you guys, bill is wrong tho ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äù
or‚Ä¶ and hear me out‚Ä¶ other people‚Äôs healthcare is non of your fucking business. 
ever heard of internalized transphobia?‚Ä¶
Brains? This is not about brains, it‚Äòs about body development and how it affects trans people.  
And sadly most of that happens before people are adults. That‚Äòs why there is a bunch of adults around them giving their expertise and making a decision with and for the child.  

Hrt also comes into play later for minors. Usually it‚Äòs affirming treatment for kids first. Allowing certain clothes, using a different name.   
These bills act like kids get all the surgeries and hrt at age 8 without any doctor examining them properly, which is not how it works ‚Ä¶ only to prohibit anything affirming.  
 
Think about this: would you deny other treatment for kids for issues that have a high chance of severely impacting them for decades or their whole life?   
Our bodily changes don‚Äòt look as gruesome as flesh wounds, but we shouldn‚Äòt let that distract us from the harm that can be caused.  
Childrens safety IS at risk. That‚Äòs why there is treatment. And it‚Äòs not giving lightly, it‚Äòs extremely hard to access hrt for the overwhelming majority.
no one is trying to groom anyone I'm a child ffs
Glad for you that you could finally be yourself!
issue is with me my insurance wont cover it, my state is going to ban the health care for medicaid (im in missouri) so even if my insurance did cover out of state it wouldnt cover it for me

- John Lewis
If only there was a democrat at the presidency...
Grassroots movements start from dirt. It's not easy and requires a collective concerted effort starting with local governments on up. But what are the alternatives? Go up against that same $100 bil organization in a revolution? Leave and hope they don't decide to take over your state too?

The problem with the left is we fight too principled. Sabotage, blackmail, and subterfuge are weapons we leave on the rack consistently. And the dead don't get to enjoy how honorable they were.
You need to find a doctor that will prescribe you HRT, I googled it, and the trans girl was talking to was denied hrt by her doctor. I went to a gender clinic that was made for trans people in New York and got prescribed hormones that same day easily no questions asked. And didn't need to try to talk a doctor into giving me hrt.

And even then, It would be better and 10,000x easier to move to a place like NY or another blue state than to try to move to an entire new country that you have to be accepted into. Like if you are moving because you aren't legally allowed hrt in your state there is 49 other options that don't require the immigration process and you needing to be a viable immigrant for Canada to take. 

I'm not saying don't move, I'm saying don't move to another country that is just as fucked with its own problems when it's really hard to even move to a new country. Canada is literally America light at this point. Cities are nice and rural areas are bad. There is states that are more accepting than Canada overall 

Idk why people think Canada is somehow this bastion of progressivism. They're just as bad for the same and different reasons than America.
Honestly, that's just christianity as a whole, and a problem with all the abrahamic religions. All of them have two things in common - inconsistency, and the belief a messiah will come back one day. Both of these things combined make it very easy for cults to rise.
Aight nvm you aren‚Äôt worth my time
Oh! I don‚Äôt care about anything besides life altering procedure, I just assumed that‚Äôs all this was about. Other gender affirming care, idc let them. As for your last statement, no! I think a lot of medical evaluations are necessary and if deemed needed, and that the child‚Äôs safety is at risk, then go forward with hormones. I‚Äôm just saying, it‚Äôs a big big deal in terms of development, and my biggest worry is someone being not evaluated or incorrectly evaluated, and it impacting them for the rest of their life.
I guess it may be a matter of priorities because for me it was life-or-death and I would have dropped my internet and phone and got a burner just to pay for that health care.
So, technically a family doctor CAN prescribe HRT here. The issue is, the doctor may not be familiar enough with handling something like that, so they may not want to prescribe it. The correct action at that point is to refer to an Endocrinologist (Exactly what my own doctor did). We also have no laws barring you from just flat out buying estrogen without a prescription and doing it all yourself
Canadian going through a ‚Äúhormone readiness assessment‚Äù right now- it depends on the province and your therapist. We‚Äôre 100% not a leader in progression in any way- but some areas are better than others. My friend in Saskatchewan is having a much harder time in her process than I‚Äôm having in mine in British Columbia. It only took me a month to get a therapist whereas it took my friend four. I‚Äôm nearing the end of my assessment whereas they‚Äôre nowhere near the end of theirs (we started around the same time and they‚Äôre older than me). I have a friend who came out when he was 7 (he lives in British Columbia as well) and was able to get hormone blockers and recently started testosterone with minimal pushback. 

No- we‚Äôre not a banner of progressiveness- but we‚Äôre not doing so bad either
That's how it works in America too though, so there is no point in trying to move countries. That's what I mean

In some parts of America it's really really fucking hard or almost impossible to start hormones. But in blue states like NY you can start them the same day if you go to a gender clinic.

Why move to Canada to face the same exact issues you face in America when like I said, there is a blue states that are more progressive and easier to get hrt in. 

America isn't so bad either if you live in the right area. Same as Canada. That's what I mean. Americans hold Canada on a pedestal and act like it's some perfect country where freedom reigns. I'd know, I hear people talk about how they're going to escape to Canada and it's going to be so much better than America. That's why I brought up the bastion progressivness.

I feel like a lot of people in other countries wish they could have what people in blue states have. That's why it's annoying when people act sau America is some third world country (people's words I've literally heard... Which let's not even get into why calling something a third world country is fucked up.). Like yeah red states are fucking hell, because of how our government and states rights work, we have to deal with it. But there is places in our country that trans people could only dream they could live. 

And obviously there is people in red states wishing they could live somewhere progressive. But if these people have the will power and money to move to Canada they can definitely move to NY.

"Well there it is. Montana house of representatives have passed a ""Right to Bully"" bill against trans kids."		"Imagine being a lawmaker thinking that this is you doing the right thing. I can only imagine the mental gymnastics at work.
so by this logic students can't be punished for calling their teachers ms. shitcock fuckstank because hey they have a right to free speech and names aren't discrimination or harassment!
Can this be contested using federal laws of anto-discrimination?
At this point people in the usa should be able to be refugees and seek asylum in other countries. This place is a cesspool
What so now it's okay to use the wrong name and gendered terms??
I'm just going to start misgendrring cis people now just to show them how it feels when they do it to us because I'm just so fed up with how they treat us.
there was a trans representative in that room. she‚Äôs Zephyr at the end there with the big red N.

our presence and visibility in front of them doesn‚Äôt even make them think twice about their actions.

Here in the UK we're mourning Brianna Ghey, trans teenager who was murdered at the weekend because the world is being told it's ok at attack human beings as long as they're trans. Shame on politics
What is going on.. anyone else feels like there's a recent tidal waves of anti trans laws hitting us?
goddamn my condolences to all the young trans people living in montana, that shit is horrible
I thought you‚Äôd be better than this Montana, good thing I don‚Äôt plan on staying here
I'm so glad I moved outta Montana in October. The place is a beautiful shithole.
I'm tired.... why can't we just live our lives
Fuck Montana. One good thing about these kinds of things is it let's everyone know where to move away from and who to boycott and where LGBT youth need more help.

I never did understand why there is so much hate in the world. Are humans really that barbaric? Children (young ones) tend to be so nice, accepting, and innocent. However, when they get older, they can grow into bigoted hate-filled adults willing to hurt other people they don't feel comfortable with.
The most powerful people in the state grouping together to make the tiny minority of trans kids lives that much more difficult.
Just thought I should add a similar bill is being introduced in Kentucky. It's a bit more in depth and basically goes parents must approve of sex education material and can formally complain if they don't like it or with hold their kid from sitting in. Then makes it illegal for schools to force teachers of students from using names and pronouns not on the students official birth certificate. Also they must report to parents if a student uses any mental health services unless there is a clear threat (which more than likely means it'll be reported all the time). I think it's sb150 or something along those lines.
What the fuck. America gets worse every day
What. The. Fuck.
It's too stressful on top of the depression of transitioning too live and deal with this anymore I'm genuinely scared for my life
The most powerful people in the state grouping together to make the tiny minority of trans kids lives that much more difficult.
Wtf seriously? Im not American so i don't know what to say!
I hate this place so much. Fuck, all I wanna do is live and let live. Why are people like this?
I cant even remotely stomach this shit anymore. Everyday is another target against CHILDREN. What the fuck, i feel so ill and i‚Äôm so scared.

I will personally beat up every child that purposefully misgenders or deadnames a trans kid, or any kid.

Fun fact: I bit my childhood bully, and you can too!   


/joking but this make me real fuckin mad
This is disgusting! What is wrong with this country?! Undoing all the work the Trevor Project had done, to thunderous applause most likely. This sucks.
I see no love coming out of this legislation.  Only hate.
It's never really been great for trans people here in Montana, especially in Great Falls were I grew up, but this is really starting to scare me.

This is literally against the constitution, how are they getting away with this?
I wish the reverse payback wouldn‚Äôt backfire as much
God I can‚Äôt imagine living in America. I wouldn‚Äôt last very long with all that anti-trans bs. I hope it eventually gets better over there :(
I‚Äôm from Montana (not currently living there, but it‚Äôs where my hometown is), and I‚Äôm not surprised. While for the majority of the time I‚Äôve seen Montana politics as ‚Äúthe government should stay out of peoples business‚Äù it has taken a hard turn right since the pandemic. My family used to be moderately conservative but now they watch Fox News every day. 

I wish I could say I‚Äôm surprised, but I‚Äôm just disappointed. I love Montana, but it looks like I won‚Äôt be able to live there again for a long time.
WHAT? they really do want us dead
Wait, so discrimination through speech isn‚Äôt discrimination?
This is already covered by the First Amendment, is it not? Last I checked, the Supreme Court has found it protected speech in school environments? I guess it's just pandering to malicious voters.
I hope that the bill specifies about malicious or repeated instances of this. I believe that it isn't discrimination if done like once which is where I think they built this bill up from but if it is literally a case of ""call anyone whatever you want maliciously with no consequence"" then it's really an awful idea which extends past trans people.
Oh, damn. And my grandmother says America is great, minus our Democratic president. I actually want to move to, like, Canada, but apparently, to my grandmother, Canada has even more corrupted government. Well, Canda's government at least isn't openly showing hatred toward trans people like they're proud of it.
No way in hell these kids would even be allowed to use their teachers first name without their permission, but this isn't worse at all.
This is going too far. Conservatives want to talk about protecting children, but they just passed a bill that will have severe consequences. The added suffering that trans kids in Montana will now undoubtedly face makes me sick to my stomach. These are CHILDREN, and these shitheads are so worried about their uneducated and bigoted views being trampled on that they are willing to subject CHILDREN to even more unnecessary suffering just to make themselves feel better. This is disgusting!
All bullies who try to hide behind this law should be called Karen or Dick, whichever is less appropriate.

Can you link an article that is bonkers
As an American I hate America so fucking much. It‚Äôs a nice place to visit but living here is hell on earth (especially if you‚Äôre a minority). Most young people I‚Äôve met agree- funny how that is. The thing is that all the young people (and by young I mean gen z or millennial bc gen a or whatever is too young) who are politically intelligent exclude themselves or don‚Äôt care about American politics bc ‚Äúthey‚Äôre not real politics‚Äù. I mean American news is atrocious- doesn‚Äôt matter what news channel. It‚Äôs all just a bunch of old farts acting like children, yelling over each other, and throwing tantrums (and it‚Äôs always two white guys). And all of the ‚Äúactual news‚Äù has follow ups of reporters giving opinions on the matter. News is supposed to be facts, not opinions. I guarantee that at least 75% of that house is white men who are over 50. Have a biased house, get a biased answer (from a biased voting system).
Honestly fuck Montana
Whelp. Guess I'm never moving to Montana
Canada is working on what we can do to create a safe place for those leaving for reasons such as this. It may be a few years away as many of our infrastructures are on brink of collapse. 


If you are in crisis be sure to reach out to a safe crisis line. The Trevor project is one i recommend. If the law feels like you don't belong here, remember you are valid, you exist, trans people have always existed, and fight to live. Our existence pissess them off, don't let them win, enjoy your existence knowing somewhere a transphobe moron is angry. Revel in it. 


Keep fighting. Do not be discouraged to a dangerous place in your mental health. You are not alone. Reach out. Find online community. You matter. You f- matter. I love you
Title IX would like to know your location
I‚Äôm really surprised that all this is happening so suddenly after I came out. The universe knows.
I swear, every day something happens that makes the ""let's start our own island nation"" idea gain a little more traction in my brain
Does this mean calling a cis men a lady (as a pejorative refring to weakness) is not descrimination?
How did Montana get this passed? I thought Montana had a trans person as one of their representatives? I swear I saw smth about a trans woman being head of Montana in the government or smth
This is what the problem is with these bills. It reads ""Use of a name and sex by a student is not discrimination"". To me it's saying that the choice is the students. I know that's not the way it's meant but that's the way it reads.
Well after seeing this s**t I'm now going to treat anyone like crap who misgenders me or uses my dead name.
We'll see how they like the same treatment given back to them.
Im speechless what is this country coming to.
I hate my life like they said it would get better but is getting worce
Once again glad that I'm in Canada and will never go to the US. I'm sorry for everyone living there, it must be so fucking shitty.
I fucking hate this state.
I mean at lest their honest/hj
Wait... I thought laws based on discrimination has to be made by the federal government??
God these people suck don't they have anything better to do than to pick on trans people. Republicans need to get a life.
Wth is wrong with this country, no leas the world. Sooner or later they‚Äôll finish off with trans people and move on to women, then people of color. Soon enough well be so backwards that the US wont even be in the same footing as the other power house countries. Cant wait to see how this ends. Fuck America.
Is this not how the right-wing Germans started in on the Jewish People in M√ºnich?
These are the same people who think that bullying and beating the shit out of kids is how you get them to ""act right""
There are no mental gymnastics. They believe this shit is right because they're brainwashed and braindead.
These people aren't pursuing a career in politics out of a sense of doing good, it's all about personal gain and inflicting suffering on those they hate.
One would think, but that's not how fascist ""logic"" works. The 'out-group' has no power to use the law against the 'in-group'. And, the teachers or other staff would simply suspend the student in question. Other students would be able to hide behind other forms of discriminatory retaliation.
I mean‚Ä¶
Yes, my thought exactly. Mr. Republican a hole where did you learn to be such a cowardly hateful bigot? Did you Mr. bigot learn that in church?
No, they can be punished for that, because the teachers are likely voting Republicans, however they can call each other that all day long and get away with it.
Only if that's their legal name

it‚Äôs outrageous we should need to seek asylum before we just off these assholes. It would be so easy. Biden is commander-in-chief and has executive powers
Hmm my first reaction to this was Nah, then I was lile‚Ä¶hmm. Like example, I live in Korea and actually my partner (Korean) had easier access to temporary visas to a lot of Western countries (like 1 or 2 years) or East Asian countries (with non- English teaching visas). Maybe not asylum seeking, but some access to like an LGBT visa class or something lol. Working holiday visa access? I don‚Äôt know, something. 

For me, finding visas not connected directly to certain jobs is essentially impossible. My ability as someone with diagnosed ADHD and probably undiagnosed autism means that my chances of pulling off those visas is low, which has kept me in Korea for years when I really really would like to move somewhere else (kust mot the US, Canada, the Netherlands, Denmark, Singapore, especially Singapore)
Yep. Actual state sanctioned bullying against trans kids.
I won't be surprised when they try to criminalize that as well, as a side effect of criminalizing correctly gendering trans people.
They'll never feel the same way as someone who's been treated that way their entire life by the vast majority of those around them, if not everyone. To them, it's just a lame joke at worst.
That‚Äôs literally been the only positive thing I‚Äôve been able to name about this state since we moved here.
Rep. Zephyr has talked about how the politicians will spew this hate and then walk up to her and say things like ""no hard feelings."" When the doors are closed, they are honest that they are only doing it to avoid being primaried against because the GOP is making this a requirement to be their chosen reps and to get funding. Some are actually this hateful, most don't really care and are just playing self interests, and fewer are disgusted by it all. That said, Zoey does believe she is moving the needle a bit behind the scenes.
Like ""registered sex offender.""

Hey, it's not harrassment to call people what we want apparently.

On the bright side though our democratic governor will likely veto it if it gets to his desk. As long as the other sections don't overrule his veto it won't pass. But they were able to overturn a veto about not allowing trans students to play in sports matching their gender identity so who knows.
Part of Their goal is to get us all thinking like this
It‚Äôs all good, they‚Äôre only hurting the children to help the children.   /S
That is the least bad thing about this bill. It basically would make it impossible for health care providers from providing gender afferming care to a minor (even if it is literally just therapy), and forbids teachers or any state employee who works with kids from ""promoting"" treatment for gender dysphoria.
Nope, it doesn‚Äòt specify. You can read the full text here: https://legiscan.com/MT/bill/HB361/2023
Or they know it‚Äôs wrong but it somehow benefits them.
Right. The out-group kids will get suspended for calling people names cuz they have no legal recourse; the deliberate bullies, however, now have a legal avenue to sue the school if they are punished in any way. And schools are already being starved of funds, so they won't do anything that might result in a lawsuit.
The thing is, the school still has rules that have nothing to do with the law. That's how you get suspended or expelled.
Public school teachers in the US are almost exclusively to the far left of the isle as American politics are concerned.  Administration and school board members though.... the complete opposite.  

Teachers have absolutely zero stake in the system, we're just pawns of the politicians, they pull the strings and we dance.  

This is the main reason why the pool of qualified educators gets smaller every year, they are actively trying to squeeze us out.

They should work on expanding that to LGBTQ+ people who feel in danger. Like, gay discrimination is still at large, like the Don't Say Gay Bill and constantly being bombarded by people who want to debate about Gay people being in Disney movies. Also, there's been a lot of shooting in the past few years relating to gay bars I think.
The thing is, here in Canada the stonewalling is also very intense. There's so few places to turn to for any trans care, and it gets complicated very easily. Every little detail can be subject to whatever nonsense people want to impose on it. As much as there is a lot of support for us and what we are, there's also a lot of sabotage. Including from ""supportive"" people.

Sorry, I know I'm being vague. But long story short, as with pretty much everything else, Canada pretends to be a lot better than we are. That's our whole thing. We're supposed to be nicer than the americans about everything, but we're just mean in a polite way. We're violent in a more covert way.
Canada's gonna have the highest trans population in the world in a few years
I'm moving to Canada asap
I've written several letters to my representative to get on top of it. I want our border open to all trans people.
Maybe America should stop trying to be on bad terms with Americans. I‚Äôm an American, I pay my fucking taxes, I deserve to be treated equally wherever I go.
I don't understand why. The people passing these laws want us gone anyway, they should welcome the prospect of a mass exodus/expatriation of trans people.
Im happy to provide generell info on germany from the perspective of someone born and living here if you want sure our politics have their own problems so im trying to stay away from them and while im still in the closet to the generell public about being trans, i have not seen much here in the way of transphobia thoug take anything i say with a grain of salt, its from my subjektive perspektive after all
so someone can legally bully someone to death then? or?
This is so stupid I'm actually just having difficulty believing it's real in my head... Wtf
Sooner or later they're gunna outlaw literally everything and I feel like it'll be sooner
Snowflakes are they. Yoda am I.
I live in VA. I think there are several anti-trans laws here? Probably more in the works too. Not sure about all of the laws though.
I know that in our school, trans people are encouraged to use the single-person bathrooms. Of course, there isn't enough for everyone. Also, there are no gender-neutral bathrooms, and trans kids are told to not go to their preferred bathroom, just the one of their ASAB. So, of course they won't.
so our government systemically incentivizes hatred of oppressed groups?

and we still think it can be reformed?
Lmfao

[How to immigrate to Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada.html)  


If you don't have family there to sponsor you, it looks like the best ways to become a resident is to learn a specialized skill (doctors and whatnot, I don't know what jobs are in demand), work for agriculture or processing factory, or become a care giver for children or the elderly.  Make sure you save up quite a bit of money as well.

Geh, *thirty* in my state.  Fucking Christ.
Damn, you Americans should establish a new party, even democrats don't like us.
I feel like that should probably be the headline?
It seems awfully vague. It seems to add to the section that describes what is discriminatory for  an educational authority but the bill is for what is discriminatory for students? 

I assume their goal is to make it so you can't be expelled or denied access because you've dead named or misgendered someone, which of course means any student is now able to call any other student by legal name and legal sex without getting in trouble. 

So in short, without a legal name change or legal sex change it isn't discriminatory, however if your legal name has been changed then deadnaming is legally discriminatory again.
These people are disgusting
You got in one.
Canada has it‚Äôs problems, and some bigots, but otherwise - you Will be legally respected in establishments, and you can be yourself here and get any affirming care you need.
Pro tip, pick Alberta or Ontario. 

Alberta's Premier (the equivalent to a governor) tried to pass a law saying they don't listen to the federal government, and then officially stated that unvaccinated people are the most discriminated against people in all of history. Alberta is like a little taste of the bigoted US in Canada.

Ontario's Premier is a fucking moron who is actively harming life for people living there. Canada has free healthcare for most things, and the Premier of Ontario is working on undoing that and switching everyone to an American style health care. And that's not the dumbest thing he's ever tried to do.

B.C. is a great place for trans people. We get easy access to most gender affirming care, and the SRS is free here, and even boob jobs for trans women/top surgery for trans men.
Exactly the one i wss thinking of, thank you for sharing the link!
Bingo bango bongo; signed, slapped and shipped forwarda again.
Yeah, as far as i know the petition going around was generally and broadly for LGBTQ+ as a whole
Even without a family doctor i was able to get in touch with a trans healthcare specialist and have my first appointment within the month. I had 2 over the phone appointments, then an in-person meeting to do bloodwork and go over informed consent in December. Due to unrelated health complications bloodwork found i had to delay hrt several months, but i came out in october, started HRT in june,  and had my name and gender legally changed by the following December. 
So even in backwater NB with only 1 trans healthcare specialist province-wide, it took me 1 year to almost fully transition. Everything but my HRT and legal fees fully covered by Medicare too. the worst ive gotten in harassment is the occasional misgendering, not the constant beatings i got back in high school when i tried to come out the first time 

Our system is not perfect and there's a lot of issues but we as trans folk here have things a lot better than America or the UK where they're 3 steps from rounding us up into camps.
Ah, y'all got Minnesota nice syndrome
They want us dead
Anywhere else this statement would sound funny, but , don't give them ideas.
This stuff needs to go to the Supreme Court, and be challenged in lower courts first to be more likely to get a good verdict if it can be successfully appealed until trans people win. Like, hey, if misgendering is considered ""free speech"" then it should be my right to choose to correctly gender people. Also, they make a distinction between trans and cis people. ""You must misgender trans people. You can't misgender cis people.""

I also feel like, the law is so silly that, unless someone sues about it, there's a high likelihood that the judge will throw out the conviction. Even if it becomes a civil suit instead of a legal one, not sure if it would go to court. Like, it should be obvious that people should have the right to gender people how they want to, and, if they are found to do it continuously to harrass and bully, they should be found guilty of harrassment.
That's part of how it works. If everyone in the country has committed a felony because the law is so vague, then the government is at liberty to prosecute only the people they want out of the way. The Soviet Union used that tactic
You should look into the history of events that happened right before N0zis took over in Germany. It all starts to make sense.

As a european, I agree with this sentiment.

Yeah
Yeah, but it also mentions ‚Äûsex‚Äú, so there is a high chance even after legal changes transphobic people will still be able to bully trans people by misgendering because their ‚Äûsex‚Äú designated at birth was different. 

This is entirely meant to be a loophole for discrimination.
That seems to be the jist of it.  It's not the ""you HAVE to use the legal name/sex as on birth certificate"" that it is made out to be.  Furthermore, as per [Section 1 refers to](https://legiscan.com/MT/text/HB361/2023)

So straight up bullying is still bullying, it just means that refer to a trans individual or using a dead name is not in of itself bullying, per se.
I live in a relatively conservative (at least politically) province, and so far any issues I've had have been minor. 15 years ago when i first came out of the closet i was beaten up and bullied regularly, and told it was my fault for being such an easy target. Nowadays, the worst ive gotten is a confused misgendering.

They need to make the initiative to get people to agree to be host families then, so that trans people can have a place to be and people to rely on until they get on their feet. 

For me, personally, I have a passport and it would be just as easy to flash that when going across the border or when I arrive in the new Canadian airport/b4 I leave the US Airport. But, for people without a passport, this'll be needed.
From time of call- where i got a few nice free therapy sessions (who referred me to the next), to the time I got an appt- it was about 5 months. Most of which was waiting on a particular doctor to have openings as all he does is transcare and has a very full schedule for new patients. I paid 0 dollars for any appointment here, and after my basic lowest tier work insurance paid some 8 bucks for 1 month the day of that  appointment.
Just to clarify - Minnesotans are *not* nice; common misconception lmao
no I do understand what you're talking about, it's just hard for people to get an idea of how bad it can be here before they come
They already have that idea.
I'm sure they've already tried. And, regardless of the law, they'd still bully trans kids to suicide.
The main issue though, is that the Supreme Court is largely Conservative I think. So, not sure how likely it is whether or not they agree with this law.
That's how you control all of the power in a society.

Yep. I'm European too. After the election that the extremists won, we still had a month to hope that all of these fascists won't get together.

They did - but they're still fighting over every little thing, every party wants something else - a theocracy, a dictatorship, communism, war, etc. etc.

If it happened in the US, the entire republican party will just go and take our rights together. I prefer them to take our rights separately, and fight each other while doing so.

I never understood this system - what if I support one thing the democratic party suggests, but not another? What if something has three solutions? Who will support the third one? How can I vote radical left, when there's only one right party and left party? That way, everyone's radical.

The thing is, changing this system isn't even that law-y - it's just changing how votes are counted.

May this thought catch on and the mouthfoamers realise what they have been doing.
I believe the numbers are that our scide rate is \~40% if we aren't accepted by those close to us, and \~4% if we are. This guy knows what's up.

Course the legislature is probably gonna override the veto :(
I love how they just look so confused.

Don‚Äôt worry, we can‚Äôt understand the transphobes either
I'm sorry, but when did Mormons become more progressive than Texas? Like how is it that at one point we all thought Mitt Romney was this great evil and now he's seen as the best Republican? I know why, it's just so fucking hard to wrap my head around this shit
I started respecting Utah a little more when I saw their joint campaign ads about respecting each other. So glad to see this. Go Utah, I believe in your ability to change!
Pro tip, avoid the toxic KSL comment section.
This is for real.? There's no catch, he actually is just concerned about the suicide rates.? It's such a relief to hear somebody say that for once..

As someone who grew up Mormon, can confirm that sometimes they pull through as good people
Damn this made me cry for no reason. I guess I'm just really glad that at least some people understand that being trans isn't easy. It's so fucking hard and the suicide rates really show it but some people can't grasp that we wouldn't choose this difficult life. I'm glad this guy does. Fucking based.
Wait... when I saw his veto comments I thought I also saw that he didn't sign for a myriad of reasons including that the bill did not include money to support schools through lawsuits that could stem from the enforcement of the law...

I know cox had a ""come to jesus moment"" after a one on one conversation with a transgender youth, but I wouldn't get too excited until the results of the legislatures attempt to override comes through. This battle is not won, this is probably more of a political victory for cox than our trans community here in Utah.

im genuinely so happy
I have only been living in Utah for just over a year so don‚Äôt really know who is in charge of my state but I‚Äôm glad to see he‚Äôs pretty cool (also I just learned that his last name is cox so that‚Äôs really cool)
You know for once I‚Äôm actually glad I live in this state :)
For what it‚Äôs worth the Mormon church officially tells people to treat LGBTQ+ with love and respect in their handbooks and stuff. Church policies are still BS and some of the higher leadership are, of course, grumpy old white dudes, but it‚Äôs better than nothing
It's not. The state legislature is absolutely corrupt and also heavily influenced by the Mormon church. The governor is less overtly partisan than the last one, but he's also endorsed Ted Cruz and Trump for president, so he's still supported a lot of harm by amplifying the reach of more aggressive politicians and their rhetoric.

Cox's words should be the bare minimum of human decency-- good for him that he doesn't want to target vulnerable kids, but is the bar really that low ? Of course it should have been vetoed.

The legislature plans to override the veto this week.
uggh, that actually choked me up, that was well written.

> I'm sorry, but when did Mormons become more progressive than Texas?

I agree it's surprising, but also remember that the Democrat Senate Majority leader for most of Obama's presidency, and before that, was Harry Reid who was a Mormon.

There are bad Christians (at this point, it feels like most) and there are good ones. Mormons are just weird Christians who wear sacred underwear. A ton of them suck, but that doesn't mean all do.

KSL?
Outsider in this subreddit but just happened upon this post. I am from Utah, and I can tell you right now this man is the most honest politician I have ever met in my whole life. He is genuinely concerned for the well being of other people, which is more than I can even say for my local government.
What do you mean? He's doing what we want.
For real, I trust politicians making laws about us about as well as I can throw them. There's been nothing but shitty anti-trans law after shitty anti-trans law for the past several months, and you expect me to believe these asshats are actually starting to actually change? Hell will freeze over before these walking crap stains ever realize why we deserve basic human rights.
That's... not how politics in a deeply conservative state works.
I also cried reading this. It felt like we were finally being heard and seen (from a republican no less), after all the crap that has been going on for two years with anti-trans legislation, it filled my broken heart to see someone finally care.
The local news outlet KSL had this article, which includes the most insulting and transphobic commentary from the legislators, so TW. It includes both his concern over financial protection for schools from litigation of the law if enforced, as well as his seemingly empathetic commentary.

Personally I have no idea how to take his stance. I wish he was fist slamming in support of gender equality and trans rights, but also am a bit ok with a politician who sees the writing on the wall and wants to keep his job, thus seems to listen.
What
Virtue signalling? He's vetoing a very harmful bill...
I'll take love and respect and trying to convince me to detransition over outright hatred any day but, uh, still not good.
I never claimed he was the best or a good person. Just that he vetoed a terrible bill
Their god made us trans... but he also made the people who made it possible to transition. God works in mysterious ways.

This is abelist language.
Thanks. I am LDS, and I try my best everyday to just love and support everyone. I appreciate it when people realize that we are people as well, and not all of us are transphobic, homophobic or the likes.
They also put out a story on this.
It's the station owned by one of the Mormon church's for-profit branches. It's usually ok for local news, and their classified section is like Utah's answer to craigslist, but the comments can be a bit crazy.
I didn't read the article and just reacted while making stupid assumptions. Whoops.
How is the bill harmful ?
Is he keeping biological males out of womens sports ?
Especially not for us who would die if we were pushed back there.
God is the cause and sole responsibility bearer for every ounce of suffering in humanity, because it would have to be, or it's not a god.
Why bother with all of it? God making trans people and then making the people who make us feel normal and secure doesn't make sense when he could have just not made us trans and go through all this in the first place. Feels like a redundancy, why would God make a redundancy? If gods not perfect he's not God and that seems less than perfect to me. 

People say God works in mysterious ways but really that's how God doing pointless redundant things is rationalised, a perfect God wouldn't let the devil terrorise the earth and let him try to turn everyone against God with God knowing he'll fail from the start, or make trans people just to make it possible for trans people to transition. It doesn't make sense to me but that's just how i see it.
So it's like a news outlet then? Gotcha
Too much shit in the news lately uh? But i think we are getting there little by little
Oh alright then :3
I did it too. I read the title over and over and I thought I was missing something
That logic is always so flawed, so do cis women with high testosterone levels or just strength usually seen in bio male people get put in men's sports then?
Yeah. Local Utah News. Can only imagine the Facebook comments on this one...
Baby steps to a new future. We just need to have hope.
No ‚Ä¶ women go to women sports 
And men into men sports.
Crazy easy right?
I noticed you dodged the question ‚Ä¶ want another swing ?
>women go to women sports And men into men sports

If you're defining women and men by biology, what I said was a valid counterpoint. You must be separating this by hormones [I don't think you're separating it by genitalia]. As seen by my point, what's the point of dividing like this besides transphobia?

>dodged the question

No? You clearly know what the bill is about, so your question was rhetorical, and I was saying that separating by biology like that is stupid and I provided a reason why.
No,I think biology is a fair way to delineate and create as level a playing field as possible.
That make me ‚Äú transphobic‚Äù?
No, it makes you ignorant. Countless studies have shown that being on estrogen/testosterone for at least a year makes the person have similar hormone levels as cis people of their gender. If you're going to cite Lia Thomas, remember that she placed [6th, 2nd and 1st in various men's competitions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_Thomas#:~:text=Thomas%20began%20swimming,1650%20free.%5B8%5D) and [1st, 2nd, 5th, 8th and 10th in various women's competitions and was 9 seconds short of the NCAA record](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lia_Thomas#:~:text=In%20March%202022%2C%20Thomas,eight%20competitors%2C%20finishing%20last.), so she only got slightly better positions as a trans woman, but there still are CIS women who are better swimmers than her.
Ranked over 200 in the mens ‚Ä¶ now winning womens NCAA titles.
You‚Äôll forgive me for laughing when you call ME ignorant while you undoubtedly don‚Äôt even know what gender you are.
And testerone levels at one time or another hardly matter if you‚Äôve gone through puberty as a male.
More and denser muscles, larger and denser bones.
Deny reality as much as you like‚Ä¶ the madness has gone too far and now you‚Äôre going to see backlash.
>undoubtedly don‚Äôt even know what gender you are.

Under Texas law, I'm now considered a sex offender. See y'all when I'm out of prison.	"Edit: I was slightly misinformed at first. The law hasn't passed passed, it has up to now *only* passed the senate. Somehow that doesn't make me feel entirely better, but here's hoping the house still has some sense. It passed the Senate 20-11. I also found out today the guy who created the bill is a senator in the same city as me. He's literally MY rep. How did I get so lucky?

To my knowledge the law hasn't taken effect yet but it did pass. But it's worded ambiguously on purpose, like most laws are, enabling the enforcers to discriminate at their discretion whatever poor sap they choose. This law in particular bans drag ""performances"" in any public space where a child might potentially see it, including in grocery stores or restaurants. It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a way that doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth. According to the law, simply wearing ""women's clothes"" when you're ""biologically a man"" could be construed as ""drag"". It goes deeper, also including other typically gendered ""accessories"" such as long hair on a ""man"", makeup or having your nails done. What does this mean in practice? It's simple. I could be seen as grooming kids, and arrested for it, for simply having makeup on when I go to the grocery store. My options? Keep doing what I'm doing and hope nothing bad happens (this is what I choose) or get scared, let the fascists win and just conform and comply, let my gender dysphoria return with a vengeance when it's finally starting to dissipate, and probably before too long, return to suicidal ideation. (This is not what I choose) Aren't you guys glad we live in the freest country in the world?"	"Start reporting Republican women when they wear pants
I am speechless. In which universe is the wearing of clothes related to grooming?
Keep the ACLU contact handy: [https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas](https://www.aclu.org/affiliate/texas)
Call fhe cops on every priest wearing a robe. After all that's a dress. Maybe they'll even find actual grooming going
Easy solution, get all the menopausal republican women reported for being too masculine. This law is so easily abusable that they'll soon realise they're going to have to sift through a thousand non-trans people before they can even find a single trans person
wtf is happening to america
You know America really prides itself on being ""land of the free"" yet every day so many people become less and less free, and I don't think they're actually considering how this is going to affect people in the long run as well

Because this is just beginning, theyre taking rights away from us and others then sooner or later we're going to see them take rights away from so many more, Just because it doesn't affect someone now doesn't mean it's not always going to and that's what these close-minded selfish dumbasses need to start thinking about. If they don't care about us maybe they'll care about themselves when they get their own rights taken
Fucking Texas.
My solution? Blow up call centers about politicians and right wing news anchors wearing makeup and how your son is now asking why men wear makeup. Why are sex offenders trying to indoctrinate my children into their trans culture?! I can‚Äôt even. üò§ 

Texas is a joke of a state. Doesn‚Äôt have a working power grid, kids dying by the dozen from shootings, but clearly the biggest issue is men in makeup. üòë
I am also in TX and dont know what this is about

Do you have a link my friend?!?

EDIT If anyone also in TX wants to message me my inbox is open. Sylvia Rivera kept a list of all the trans folks she knew and their emergency contacts in her bible. that, along with her other activism, inspired me to want to network to other trans folks near me. so my inbox is open  and i would love to hear from you ü©∑

‚ÄúHey Patrick! What am I now?‚Äù
I concur with any suggestion for malicious compliance and weaponization of the law. However, what's missing is basically how to go about that safely. 

First up, be in contact with a law professional. This law WILL backfire so there's probably some legally-inclined allies out there waiting to help use their knowledge and abilities to help it get overturned in courts.

Second, loopholes, loopholes, loopholes. Study up the law like it's the Bible and figure out what you can do that you can't be arrested for. The ambiguity inherent in it will allow you to exist comfortably as you want to, just with a few caveats.

Lastly, break the law. Not by direct illegal resistance to it but by using itself as a weapon against itself. This circle back to my first point of getting in contact with someone who knows legal stuff because you want to do things that would get you in trouble, put you in a courtroom, and force the court to evaluate the legitimacy of the law. You want to coordinate this with a community of people who the law effects (which include basically anyone who works with clothes and makeup) so that no single individual bears the cost of the case and the number of problems with the law become more apparent. 

But above all else, survival while oppressed is better than death while oppressed. Be cautious, focus on your health and well-being, and make enough sacrifices to keep yourself safe. Do not conform totally but don't risk it all just to lose it all in prison unless you plan on writing a book.
What? It's normal for men to have longer hair, and I hope there's a fucking outrage this is a violation of human rights! Aren't the Republicans the ones who love America bc of our ""free country?"" It's not freedom if people are being forced to comply to rules that sound like they came from religious transphobes
I live in one of the states that followed Texas, and managed to pass a law like this. It's super scary and difficult, because I've already socially transitioned and changed my name. At this point, I don't own anything that wouldn't be considered Drag under these bills. I've been transitioning for 3 years, I don't have my old clothes or name or anything anymore, and can't afford to buy a new wardrobe to re-stealth. I haven't been able to afford my hormones either for about a year, so I look obviously trans right now. I'm stuck in a terrible place. Even going to the store is a terrifying ordeal.  


I really wish we didn't have to go through these kinds of things. I wish I could help you, but at least I can say you aren't alone. We'll all get through this together somehow.
>It goes on to define ""drag"" as anyone who dresses or presents in a waythat doesn't ""match"" their biological sex assigned at birth.

This isn't fair. I completely agree that sex, nudity and raunch shouldn't be exposed to kids, but drag queens typically aren't doing that stuff around minors. I've been to the drag queen story hours where I live. Reading Babar books while wearing a dress isn't sexual or offensive.
Do they realize that practically every painting of Jesus he has long flowing hair, and is never seen wearing slacks or a button down shirt? 


Hey Texas, I learned in school about a bunch of men who wore curly wigs, tights, and high heeled shoes: the founding fathers!  (Some of them even spoke French) 


And how about makeup? I'm sure tough guys like Trump or Chuck ""Texas Ranger"" Norris would never wear make up,except every single time they are in front of a camera. 


Anyways, good luck in prison, along with a very large chunk of the rest of the state.
Wait they arrest men with long hair, nails and makeup? Can't wait to see them arrest a Black metal musician
Just move a bit north up here to New Mexico where your rights are protected and the community is absolutely fine with you being here.  We have legal weed, free college, and the most bomb food you'll ever ear.

&#x200B;

We even passed the ""Reproductive and Gender-Affirming Health Care Freedom Act"" which codifies our rights.  We even allow people to change their gender on their drivers license without a doctors note.  Even ""x"" if you want to identify as non-binary or gender neutral (That's what's on my license)  


  
This place kicks ass.
Can someone link me the law that passed? Is it SB12 or something else? Thanks in advance
Are you referring to bill [HB4378](https://translegislation.com/bills/2023/TX/HB4378) ?
Leave. Even Mexico is better than this shit.
Nothing says freedom like forcing everyone else to conform to the exact lifestyle you think is best
I‚Äôm having fun imagining effeminate trans men and masculine trans women mess with their brains x)
As people above say once a stupid amount of reports get submitted and people use it against them then it‚Äôll soon stop being enforced.

It‚Äôs the same concept as the book bill that was passed lately, the intent was to stop being able to teach about lgbt and sex under the guise of it being inappropriate for children so people have started to report the bible for the same thing and under their law it‚Äôs entirely reasonable to do so.

They will not have thought this through enough for the consequences that will happen
Sorry for spamming the hell out of your post OP. thank you so much for making it or I wouldnt know this even happened. The disinformation makes it hard to sort fact from fiction. 

Sylvia Rivera was arrested over 200 times for ""upper head female impersonation"" and what did she say? She said ""I REFUSE to pass!"" She compared it to a POC passing as white. 

OP I encourage you to listen to her old interviews... Making Gay History's first ep of their podcast has an interview with her and a lot of other fiesty historical queer folks that will comfort and motivate you. Ive been listening to it and it helps, i promise, to hear people from the 70s or 40s talk about what they went through and hearing the radical shit they were saying/doing then. 

As Chuck Rowland in s1e7 of the podcast, who got fired for being gay and fought it for 15 years until the government sent him a letter apologizing, said... This is how people get radicalized--  they get fucked with! And they see its bullshit, and the light comes on and they fight back

We have to get our country back on track and the only way to make positive strides is to vote these conservatives out of office. We need the majority vote in both the house and the the senate.
The land of the free. Equal rights for all.

You have another realistic option too, and that's move out of the christostan caliphate to an actual free part of the county.  Life has never been better for us in solidly blue states.
I hate it here. I wish I could be taken away from Texas myself
I swear to god this is one of the most flawed fucked up laws in American history.

Wtf doesn't the US have more serious problems? Like in general? Oh well divide and conquer right? How can there be a majority for any laws like that, not just within the general population but even within the gop?

Well in for a country that feels comfortable incarcerating 505 ppl per 100000, which actually is a huge improvement if you can believe it by about 190 from 2018, it kinda tracks, I just guess they felt like they were missing a couple of prison slaves in their prison industrial complex to line their pockets.

At this point it seems the only 3 options left would be to either take radical steps to strip them of their power, generalstrike have EVERYONE lay down their work until they step down [maybe just have everyone dienie just republicans any type of service might work] a revolution something like a civil war or removing your self and as many people and money as you can from the economy and move it to a different country maybe even Mexico, that would be fun to see the reaction of politicians when Mexico economy is growing while the US economy is falling into a deep recession 

Internationally how about sanctions? We're more than just one nation. Maybe have all US trans people ask for asylum and force political action of other nations, because of draconian prosecution. If Western nations condem Russia for this type of shit a couple of years ago they should do the same  to the US.
Only word of advice for you: join your local Pink Pistols, Socialist RA, or EFJBC chapter, organize, and be VERY cautious. Don't go quietly into the night.

This could lead to some very terrible things or situations, this is wild but not really totally a surprise considering it's texas.

Same here in Tennessee.  Except here it's only a temporary judicial order keeping it from being currently active.
Get as many people in texas to report as many people as possible, flood the system with false reports, that should piss them off and hopefully anyone ‚Äúguilty‚Äù will slip through unnoticed, then burn the system to the ground (take that as literally as you feel like taking it)
i‚Äôm usually pretty good and understand the ‚Äúother‚Äù person‚Äôs side.  like even if i don‚Äôt agree, i can still understand where they‚Äôre coming from, even if their logic‚Äôs really flawed, but how is dressing as an opposite gender grooming?  what could you possibly be grooming a child for by wearing a dress?  and by grooming, i mean the textbook definition, how tf is it grooming?
Well they define drag pretty clearly I guess. How do they define ""performance""?
We will not comply!

have you ever documented anything about your transition officially? name changes, gender changes, anything like that?
I just want civil war & to divide already, or Die trying.
I'm apolitical, so don't have a strong opinion either way. 

I am curious as to why some people feel so strongly that that drag performers, who present an often sexualised parody of women for adult entertainment, would ever need to interact with children?
[deleted]
The same bill was passed into law here in TN, but it's currently embattled legally.  A judge already put a stay on allowing it to go into effect.
so just having long hair would make me a sex offender even if I have a beard that is crazy.
I‚Äôve always wondered why anyone thinks the US is so free. From the outside it‚Äôs a deeply unattractive place, and steadily getting worse. Stay safe.
Okay I've read over this shit and it seems the bill - if I'm reading it correctly and assuming the word ""and"" in law between two criteria/conditions in a legislative document means that both the terms before AND after are required for it to apply... - says that it performances in the nude generally, or cross dressing in the context of...a performance that ""appeals to the prurient interest in sex"" if people under 18 are around or if it's done in a public space one can reasonably assume a minor could see. Now what that means legally speaking - and thankfully it's not just some new string of words in law - is... well

>material appealing to prurient interest as material having a tendency to excite lustful thoughts, and defined prurient interest as a shameful or morbid interest in nudity, sex, or excretion 

However, of course, this is subjective to some extent. And all the above is simply defining what counts as a ""sexually oriented performance"". More importantly perhaps is that - again if I'm reading the damned law correctly...it's a law prohibiting owners of commercial venues as well as anyone who might be able to authorize these types of performances. And, even with the vagueness of the legal definition above...it seems that ""Drag queen story hour"" would be a stretch-armstrong type reach to prohibit. Further it doesn't seem to say anything about arresting people. Mostly just fines - for business owners or people able to authorize public performances. 

So, if all parties act in good faith and to the law as written, it literally does not prevent you from presenting fem in public. It just states that if you are presenting fem in public...and acting like...sexual in fairly performative ways or just otherwise inappropriate ways then you might have a problem, or in a place of business be asked to stop/leave. So like...don't play grab ass or anything and it \*shouldn't\* be an issue. ... 

Kind of underwhelming as far as these laws go, tbh. A different state iirc is doing a law where if you're a ""male dressing as a female"" you can't even ""monologue"" in public...whatever the hellish fuck THAT means. 

If any legal buffs wanna correct my interpretation of this shite please do so.

Unfortunately its not just southern states.  I live in a liberal state in the northeast, and my TERF sister in law, who is a self proclaimed ""progressive"", lost her shit when her trans 12 yo kid started talking to me about gender stereotypes and i told them i presented as femme.  Lost. Her. God. Damn. Mind. Literally the conversation involved clothes and nail polish. I would never have guessed in a million years she was so transphobic. But I might as well have been being yelled at by Ron DeSantis.

Point being, unfortunately, while its a minority in most places, many people we would think would be our allies, still hold this sick transphobic bigoted view.
You know cops would turn a blind eye to that cause Jesus
How about female cops wearing pants?  That doesn't sound like it conforms with traditional women's clothing.
Yes report all of the women wearing jeans. Or just anything other than a dress. Then report the men for wearing shorts saying they look effeminate.
Yes. This. Totally this.

Just like someone in Utah turned that state's book-banning law on it's head to demand the Bible be removed from a school
Report any of them that have short hair. Report them for wearing pant suits. Report them for not wearing heels, makeup, jewelry etc. Hell, you could get really petty and report ones with broad shoulders and square jawlines. Menopause can also cause facial hair to grow, report that. Literally anything to abuse this barbaric law.
Okay, yeah, all that, but like. They KNOW these laws will be challenged. That's the goal. They want it to get to higher and higher courts to:

1. Waste time and


2. Give the generally conservative-filled courts a chance to support them officially.
It is the fascist takeover after all the political infrastructure was put in to ban abortion.

Conservatives got involved in their primaries. Conservatives worked locally in the political machinery. Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative states. The most reliably conservative judges were put in at all levels. The Supreme Court was even taken.

The zero-middle ground polices of anti-abortion activists and religious groups built the infrastructure and led to this.

Anything diassproved of by conservative churches will be torn down.
Look up Seven-Mountain Dominionism. It is, unfortunately, not as crazy as it sounds. It‚Äôs basically the root of all the anti-abortion, anti-LGBT+, etc. legislative nonsense
Short hand notes‚Ä¶ government people (state and federal) are upset at a minority and want to make it impossible to live as said minority or just straight genocide said minority because it‚Äôs getting too hard to control and loud to ignore anymore.

There's a problem regarding the little green pieces of paper with dead guys on them. I don't have enough.

I think we need to start looking into non profits in our states to help our family in other states at this point, much like the Aunty network does for women seeking abortions.

They word these things super ambiguously on purpose. They want them to be able to be abused. It accomplishes 2 things. This way, of course most people fall for it, because of course you don't want sexually explicit drag queens dancing in front of kids. The 2ns thing it accomplishes is that it enables any transphobic or homophobic police officer, store manager or even just a regular person, to say they see it as a performance, they see it as drag, etc. And you can catch a lot more people in the net. That's not something that's possible to happen with more specific wording. Go back and look at all the bills republicans have made in recent years. They're ALL worded this way. It's on purpose.
Patriarchal valuation of masculinity and devaluation of femininity.

It‚Äôs the same reason why the culture warriors obsess over (especially feminine) gay men more than lesbian women.
Not legally no. But I am in the process currently of getting my name and gender marker changed. Surprisingly easy in this state, it just takes a while for the process. Equally surprising is that Texas is not one of the states in which you have to have had srs in order to change your gender marker. All you need is a court order, which judges in Austin will all too readily and happily give, which is why they are so backlogged, and all you need for that is a letter from a physician. There is no law that says judges have to honor the letter and getting one doesn't guarantee your petition will be accepted, but I've heard of exactly zero cases of anyone getting denied out of Austin, which is why everyone goes there. I'm trying to hurry up and get that done before that changes too.
You don‚Äôt have a ‚Äústrong opinion‚Äù on whether any random ‚Äúfree‚Äù citizen of a ‚Äúfree country‚Äù should be abused & arrested for, literally, just existing in society, while wearing ‚Äúany 3‚Äù  of; clothing, shoes, accessories, makeup, hair &/or nails, that some power-tripping, stick-up-their-‚Äú***‚Äù puritanical authoritarian ‚Äúmoralist‚Äù arbitrarily decided, does not ‚Äúmatch their AGAB‚Äù?

So, I guess that means you don‚Äôt care about equality, freedom, & human rights? Or, at least, not enough to ‚Äúhave a strong opinion‚Äù‚Ä¶?
It's Senate bill 12.
Everything I've read said it passed 20-11 but hasn't taken effect yet.
Constantly deconstructing these bill‚Äôs tripwire spiderweb, Machiavellian legal language, is exhausting, and decidedly bad for my mental health. So, I‚Äôm just going to leave a few quick points for your consideration, regarding how this ‚Äúlaw‚Äù could be used.

First, understand that those pushing these bills, see any ‚Äúdeviance‚Äù from, what THEY CONSIDER to be, normalized cis-het gender presentation, as based purely in ego & sexuality, & therefore serving NO OTHER PURPOSE than ‚Äúappealing to the prurient interest in sex‚Äù, to the presenting individual, & to any other person who happens to see them.

Further, seeing as how they deny that being transgender is a real thing, & that being ‚Äútrans‚Äù is not a ‚Äúlegitimate ontological state of being‚Äù. They view ANYTHING, other than ‚ÄúAGAB appropriate presentation‚Äù, PURELY as ‚Äúa PERFORMANCE‚Äù. This includes, but is not limited to, walking down the street, engaging in casual conversation, friendly waving to another person‚Ä¶ you know what? Just put LITERALLY ANYTHING here, & it would apply.

Honestly, that‚Äôs enough. I‚Äôm going to stop there.

I hope it helps view the language of this bill in a more illuminated light.
I would rather not see this country descend into civil war over this dumb culture war bullshit. Civil war means our families and friends are now on the menu. No thanks. I‚Äôd rather see an amicable split. I grew up in Vicksburg, MS. The losing side never really recovers. Ask me how I know‚Ä¶
Also, report cis women for wearing women‚Äôs clothes. They will need to prove they don‚Äôt have dicks.

This will not end well for fascists.
It's been said before, it will be said again. Malicious compliance is the greatest tool of a civil activist
Yea but they act likenthwyre straight outta the 60's
I‚Äôm an Aussie but from what OP‚Äôs said about this law it totally could apply.
It's 2023 we shouldn't have to defend what we wear

And you're delusional to think they won't go that far
And Tennessee. And it‚Äôs in the works for Arizona, Arkansas, Idaho, Kansas, Kentucky, Missouri, Montana, Nebraska (but that one is being filibustered into oblivion), Oklahoma, South Carolina, and West Virginia. 
*sigh*
Yup, plus who do they think they are parading around as a police officer? That's a MAN'S job. /s
No kidding. It's like the republicans haven't seen 80's metal bands before.
Probably only do this if you're positive they're an evil neocon demon. Don't want innocent people who live in these states and don't even support these laws to be hurt just because they're cis and typecast as a boomer Fox News enjoyer.
I'm worried this could backfire.

They might actually make all women wear dresses
Not just jeans, sneakers/trainers too...no more skate shoes, no more running shoes, no more B-Ball shoes

It's high heels and dressy flats from now on.

Malicious Compliance, comrades!
Could I have more info on that ?
Not if we tear them down first.
> Conservatives gerrymandered districts to guarantee wins in conservative and non-conservative states.

FTFY. If you look at Wisconsin, looking at the results from recent state wide ballots, they should have close to 50/50 R and D representation in the legislature, but they don't. Their electoral map is so heavily gerrymandered to weaken Democratic voices and strengthen GOP to where the Republicans have a supermajority in both the house and senate.
Wanting to bring about the end times and make the US a theocracy isn‚Äôt the sanest notion in my book, but yes, they have been at it for a long time.

The Dominionists aren‚Äôt the only ones involved though. Alliance Defending Freedom, Heritage Foundation, Family Policy Alliance, Focus on the Family, and American College of Pediatrics (not the AAP) have backers from multiple demographics, not just Dominionists. Gotta love the BS in those names though.
Exactly, as time goes on they're just going to keep taking more and more of peoples rights so just because it doesn't affect some people now doesn't mean it won't down the line

People think it's bad now but sooner or later it's going to get a lot worse if this carries on, I mean seriously what's next? Are they going to start not allowing women to work again or maybe they'll start separating places by color again. Because there is literally no end goal here besides people getting more and more power to just take away rights that everyone should have over their own life
Right?! No no no. Men in makeup who perform things I ENJOY are okay. What you enjoy is clearly evil!
That's facepaint, just like GI Joe isn't a Doll, he is an Action Figure
OMG I meant call obsessively in high volume to drive them insane! üòÖ how‚Äôd I forget this is America?
This has not been passed into law yet!!!
Grew up in Portland and moved to Texas, now sadly in Missouri and my spouse is trans and was just getting brave enough to transition and now‚Ä¶all of this! Enjoy Oregon, visit the falls in Corbett and Ashland! Good luck and we will probably be right behind you :)
$10 civil penalty similar to any other civil infraction such as parking tickets.
‚ÄúNo! I‚Äôm Texas!‚Äù
I‚Äôm so sorry. I‚Äôm originally from Texas but I moved out last year. I hope you stay safe babe üíñü´Çü´Ç
Thats fair! I mean same, but im inspired by how radical Sylvia was and how she believed we had the right to be openly queer. I think what she was saying was we shouldn't have to pass to be safe, and at the time ""pass"" meant passing as cishet and assimilate into white cishet society. I mean Sylvia also says ""if you walked down 42nd street and even LOOKED like a f-ggot you were getting arrested."" The point I think she wanted the hate to STOP, not find ways to navigate it and just survive it. She wanted change. She wanted liberation!!!!! Theres an underground documentary about Sylvia on youtube I recommend called ""More than Stonewall"". If you havent listened to the full interview that quote is from I encourage you to!

Edit i see this is getting downvoted. Why downvote our own history? Like yes I want to pass to avoid violence but it doesnt end there, I dont want to quietly pass and leave everything as it is just so the violence hits the nonpassing folks. I want the violence gone. Why downvote that? Very curious if anyone wants to lmk
just learn 2 code, duh
To those downvoted me... I was being sarcastic....
You don‚Äôt need tens of thousands of dollars to move, and you can take as long as you need to squirrel away bits of cash here and there. Advising somebody to move doesn‚Äôt come with the expectation it can be done immediately and effortlessly. 

I moved cross country for unrelated reasons in 2011. It took a little over a year and a half of scrounging whatever I could from the $8/hour I earned at the time until I had enough to survive a few months without work. It was hard, it was a grueling wait, but it was worth it and I‚Äôd do it again without hesitation.
I fear since this witchhunt started, that this is the real reason behind those bills.
This! The solution is to take back liberal majorities or at least get rid of supermajorities in Red States, not to run and let the bigots win. We need to keep up emigration from places like New York and California to progressive cities in the Deep South like Atlanta, Austin, and New Orleans. At the same time, blue states need to make themselves as unattractive as possible to the right wing by implementing progressive policies.
So which four of the current 19 solidly blue state legislatures do you think they're going to try to switch by forcing Democrats out?

Virginia is the only one I could possibly see flipping anytime soon.
Anyone who sings, lipsyncs, dances, or otherwise ""performs"" in front of an audience. A performance could be something as simple as ""crossdressing"" as an actor in costume. 

Please refer to my other post much longer on this thread going over the law itself. The criteria is not JUST that. Now unless the law doesn't view the word ""And"" between two sections when describing what constitutes the offence itself as binding them together and requiring both to be true. 

This one seems to not be worded the way some other more psychotic bills are worded, strangely enough. Did you read through it and check the definitions and all that jazz?

Furthermore it seems to be targetted towards owners of establishments as well as any person who can authorize a public performance - I assume that to mean someone who's job it is to schedule events like that or give the go-aheads. It doesn't seem to specify anything about the PERFORMER being charged with breach of this law - unless they're also the owner of the establishment I suppose.
Then I strongly recommend you leave the state as soon as you feasibly can. Texas is trying to make lists of trans people with records of name and gender changes; it‚Äôs possible the list has already compiled and they‚Äôre pretending it needed tweaking.

https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/ken-paxton-list-trans-texans-1234647489/amp/
Ok wow thank you so much
So what does this mean. As a trans man on T, if i was in drag would that be considered legal? But me being masculine and wearing masc clothes would be illegal?
That still doesn't change the fact that the bill isn't targeting individuals on the street, nor even performers themselves, but people who own venues who allow it on their venue, as well as like...public workers who authorize performances in public spaces. 

Not in this bill, at least. 

This does not seem to allow one to be arrested for being trans or even cross dressing.
I don‚Äôt know shit bout the us but wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if that shit happens
Report cis men for wearing men's clothes. Claim that they are really women who are just trying to make men look bad.
Report any female officers who respond for wearing pants.
transphobic republicans are unironically already doing this tho. in some ways i think this was kind of their goal. i remember hearing about a case in a literal elementary school where they wanted to check all of the little girls to make sure they didn't have dicks. its absolutely insane they can talk about wanting to do this and people support it and don't see the obvious pedophilia but are so brainwashed that they think trans people just existing is pedophilia. its absolutely insane. but i dont think we should be doing what the transphobes have been doing. maybe im wrong, thats just my opinion. idk i guess my point is that transphobes have already called me and other allies the t slur ""because of my jawline"" (in other words because im an ally. im a cis woman btw) and i just dont really see why we would join sides with them in that? i dont know, if someone could explain this to me that would be greatly appreciated, im just trying to understand!
exactly. lots of 100% passing trans people, you want that bulked up dude with a beard and biceps the size of a watermelon, wearing skirts and using the same bathroom as ""our innocent children""? like okay, im transmasc. im not allowed to use the mens room because im biologicalpy female, but (hypothetically) if i was on HRT for 5 years, top surgery, full male presentation... theyd still want me in the womens room?

i think they only hate ""non passing"" trans people because it has nothing to do w being trans because guess what, you cant always tell üò≠
Still can't argue that to a judge in 2023.
No judge is going to interpret women wearing pants as women in drag
Tennessee got theirs struck down by the courts
Edit: sorry not struck down but blocked. We shall see how long the block will last.
The Secession States.
The West Virginia bill died in committee and the session is adjourned sine die.
Damn right! Haha
The malicious compliance venom in that was golden‚Ä¶we probably could take it a step further and start saying Y job before sufferage is considered a ‚ÄúMANS‚Äù job so no women should be allowed to be x job title. Asumming the law is that ambiguous. Probably not but it would get a good point across if the law is that broad and grasping at straws. I hope we don‚Äôt have to do that to make a point but if we must we must.
Which is ironic considering so many have used We're Not Gonna Take It by Twisted Sister as a campaign song (or whatever it's called) and yet... have any of them actually looked at Twisted Sister?
You're probably not wrong. They did just make it so women in the  Missouri house can't show their shoulders. I'm sure the Christian right wing would gladly make every woman wear a burka
Eeeep. The Handmaid‚Äôs Tale.
Actually, high heels were [originally and more commonly seen on men in cavalry positions](https://artsandculture.google.com/story/the-high-life-a-history-of-men-in-heels/iQJCgMgwSKV5Kw) \- by traditional conventions, all male soldiers should be wearing high heels. See how the transphobes reckon with that one.
Sure...

[Here you go ](https://www.sltrib.com/news/education/2023/03/22/utah-parent-says-bible-contains/)
Strangely, while they have managed to influence backers from outside of the traditional dominionist fold, all of those organizations were founded on 7M values and by 7M members. Just because they don‚Äôt currently claim direct dominionist end goals, that doesn‚Äôt mean they aren‚Äôt dominionist organizations. They‚Äôre all pushing for those seven mountains. Whether the members realize it or not, that‚Äôs what their leadership is reaching for.
well there are conservatives talking about taking away womens right to vote....
If they‚Äôre allowed to continue unchecked, gay rights and marriage are absolutely next.
Yep still needs to pass house and govenor, but yaknow abbot so just the house really
My wife used to live there and we‚Äôve traveled there many times.
Oh gotcha
‚ÄúWhat‚Äôs the difference?‚Äù ü§∑üèº‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è
I get frustrated when people say ""just move!"" as if anyone can do it if they work hard enough. You ever considered that maybe the person has family they support? Old/sick relatives, a kid that can't move away from their other parent? Maybe they're sick themselves and can't lose their medical support? They have too much debt to save any spare money? They're underwater on their mortgage and the house won't sell? They work in an industry that can't be relocated? All their spare change goes to supporting someone else who'd be homeless without them? Being in the state they're in literally prevents them from saving money due to the financial hardships created by that state's laws? They can't work because they're disabled?

""Just move, you can do it if you save enough!"" Is ""pull yourself up by your bootstraps"" rhetoric. I'm glad moving worked for you. It worked for me too. Doesn't work for everyone.
There were some republican state politicians late last year that actually said the goal was to drive all the liberals to blue states so they get a super majority in 35 states.  I can't remember who it was, but there were videos circulating for a few weeks about it.
Austin has tried to fight the state numerous times. Abbot, Paxton, and Patrick have smacked them down multiple times. HISD has been taken over. AISD is next on the retribution list.

Austin will lose. The local liberal tech companies don‚Äôt have the stomach to fight. They have shareholders to answer to and shareholders don‚Äôt give a damn about a few trans people getting their lives ruined.

Ok, l guess I‚Äôm doing this, after all. Let‚Äôs go, then‚Ä¶

*I have taken the liberty of adding quotations & parentheses for personal comments, & to aid understanding, & edited out excess legal jargon, not relevant to the point, for ease of digestion.

(From) [Section 1](https://legiscan.com/TX/text/SB12/id/2771604)

(applies to) Performances on; 

PUBLIC PROPERTY, 
(anywhere that is not private property)

on the premises of a commercial enterprise, 
(any business holding whatsoever)

or, in the presence of a child 
(literally anywhere).

So, as to where this can be applied‚Ä¶ well, you tell me. Can you think of ANY PLACE where these conditions would fail to be met? (Other than specifically licensed establishments for ‚Äúadult entertainment‚Äù). It‚Äôs literally ‚Äúeverywhere‚Äù a person could possibly find themselves.

(From) Section 3.

A ‚Äúsexually oriented performance‚Äù means a visual performance that features:

A.(ii) a male performer exhibiting as a female, or a female performer exhibiting as a male, who uses clothing, makeup, or other similar physical markers and who ‚Äúperforms‚Äù before an ‚Äúaudience‚Äù (2 or more people); or

(B)  appeals to the ‚Äúprurient interest‚Äù in sex.
(Examples of ‚ÄúPrurient Interest‚Äù, taken from [LawInsider.com](https://www.lawinsider.com/dictionary/prurient-interest): 1. ""Prurient interest is an appeal to an unhealthy, abnormal, unwholesome, degrading, shameful, or morbid interest in sex."" Id. at 117. 2. Prurient interest could be said to be the lowest common denominator, the assumption being that the material is bound to be sexually arousing to at least someone.)

(b)  A person commits an offense if, REGARDLESS OF WHETHER COMPENSATION for the ‚Äúperformance‚Äù IS EXPECTED OR RECEIVED, the person engages in a ‚Äúsexually oriented performance‚Äù:

Please take particular note of the language, ‚ÄúA *PERSON* commits an offence if‚Ä¶ *THE PERSON* engages in a‚Ä¶ performance‚Äù

This is regarding the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù, being charged with an offence, NOT a business, or property owner. 

Also, PUBLIC PROPERTY is stipulated as an area of effect. Who owns public property? Who are they going to bring an offence against? Themselves, the government? No, of course not. The offence is given to THE INDIVIDUAL ‚ÄúPERFORMER‚Äù. This legislation makes it possible to EXTEND the responsibility, for the offence, to property owners, allowing them to be charged/fined/sentenced, AS WELL AS any individual ‚Äúperformers‚Äù.

The primary offence is on the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù, themselves.

If not specifically codified in this particular bill, believe that other presiding bills have already laid out the legal consequences for the person considered to be the ‚Äúperformer‚Äù. I do not have all the specifics off the top of my head, and I don‚Äôt have the time to take this explanation further. You will find it, if you look for it. Being able to charge the property owner for an illegal performance, is not possible without the performance having been already made illegal, & consequences & proceedings for the initiating individual already being in existence.

So, combine this information, with my initial response, & begin to see how dangerous & discriminatory this law would be‚Ä¶ ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è Hopefully‚Ä¶?
me neither and I‚Äôm gearing up to be able to flee if it happens
We‚Äôre mostly just venting and showing the illogic of the bill. The idea is to overwhelm the system with reports against conservative people they have to abandon the law. But I‚Äôm reality we know they‚Äôll just ignore these and only prosecute people they know are trans, no matter how many false reports we flood them with.
Yeah it seems like these laws are focused on the vulnerable trans folks still In awkward phases of transition. The right is clueless about how many of us will look like cross-dressers if we dress according who our AGAB.
They're trying to ban men from wearing traditionally women's clothing

With that logic, women wearing traditionally men's othibg should also get in trouble

It's just to maliciously comply with them
No doubt. But a shittonne of reports, considered legitimate according to the vaguely worded law, could potentially get it repealed. It‚Äôs been done before.
Most likely long enough that it will be struck down.
What does sine die mean?
Their predecessors from the 80s (and maybe themselves if old enough) were diametrically opposed to using this song or anything else vaguely metal because of the Satanic Panic. And men in 80s metal bands were often made fun of for being ""femme"" or suspected of being gay or just sexual deviants.  The language that we have today to describe gender variance pretty much didn't exist, but take a look at bands like Poison and other glam metal bands (including TS, actually).  These are all cis men who didn't  cross dress outside of performances or videos,  but that slight amount of gender bending style was enough to implode the brains of most of the conservatives back then.  

Tl;Dr I can't fucking believe any of them are using that song for their campaigns.  Dee Snider and whoever else is left of Twisted Sister should sue the fuck out of them.  Ridiculous fucking people. 

Edit: i guess the whole thing where he said to stop playing that song already happened.
Nah because they are so racist that they wouldn't want their wives looking like ""terrorists""
And show them the portrait of Louis XIV (14th) in his red-soled high heels!

I believe it was the Persians(?) who either pioneered the use or at least popularised them for cavalry use, I could be wrong.
Thanks :)
I didn‚Äôt know about that law
Oh yeah I really wouldn't be surprised if they start passing laws that don't allow women to work especially considering all of the laws they've been trying to pass banning abortions and allowing forced pregnancies during literally any circumstance and any age
Seriously? I can't say I'm surprised but fucking hell. Do you have a source or anywhere I can read more about this?
I need a source to show my family.
100% agree with you, they are not going to stop if this continues
It will almost certainly pass. There is no doubt in my mind üòû
i understand that. I'll be fighting with you guys until the end tho. stay strong. i know its hard. but they want us dead and we should stay alive even if solely to spite them
absolutely. they dont understand the nuances and facts of it. they know the caricature of a trans person that these right wingers have made up and then decided to blame for everything, subsequently catching real trans people in the crossfire. no we have to deal with the repercussions of some fake radical groomer trans person that they made up who doesn't even exist
I get what this is about but no judge is going to consider pants for women to be traditional mens clothing in 2023.
‚ÄúWithout a day‚Äù

It means the session is over for good.
No, you're right, it was first the Persians as far as I know.

My first time seeing a man in heels was with the Swedish band ABBA. ABBA is awesome.
In theory suits should still work. That's only a past-decade sort of thing for the most part. Sure it's been worn before that and it's gained popularity since, but by no means is it traditional
You're missing the broader picture and thus the point. It's not about actually having a judge decide on these, it's about flooding the system with reports to drown out any actual reports submitted by transphobes. They won't have the resources to investigate every single one, at least not in a timely manner.
By their logic they have too but idk

I'm not American so woo
They are.

first man in heels for me was Tony Curtis and Jack Lemmon in ""Some Like it Hot"""	12hw16y	trans	1688	0.98	2023-04-10 20:59:15
MY STATE JUST BANNED CONVERSION THERAPY	Hi y'all, so the other day, the governor of my state (Pennsylvania) signed a bill banning conversion therapy in the state. This is a massive leap forward for the Pennsylvanian trans comunity, as well as the lgbtq community as a whole. I'm extremely excited for this bill, as now all of my Pennsylvanian lgbtq friends no longer have to live in fear that they will be tortured, assaulted, or worse for being their true and authentic selves.	"I live in PA too. This is another great step forward.
Holy shit, it's insane to think it was legal ANYWHERE in 2022. Happy for the trans community in PA!
Congratulations to you and your neighbors. It sucks that the absolute bare minimum is cause for celebration, but don't let that stop you from doing so! üíï
Also from Pennsylvania. We need people to get out and vote in November. The only reason this happened is because Governor Wolf has stayed ahead of the state Legislature. We'll be fucked if Mastriano wins against Shapiro.

We ... must ... VOTE.
Lets hope half the state doesnt vote for a nazi supporting, woman and lgbtqia+ hating fear monger and mess it all up. Shapiro & Fetterman 2022 ü§ûü§û
WOOO YEAH FINALLY OUR STATE DOES SOMETHING GOOD
HOLY CRAP!!THIS IS AWESOME!I LIVE IN PA!
I read the title wrong and thought they banned hormone therapy in PA for a sec lmaoooo. big win!
I envy you, i live in the uk where all conversion therapy is banned beside trans conversion since boris was a transphobic cumstain on a hotel curtain
Wait what‚Äôs conversion therapy?
This is amazing news to hear today ‚ù§Ô∏è
Awesome - hopefully Fetterman will inspire people to the polls (to vote for him or against Oz) and there will be a blue wave‚Ä¶
My mom told me and I‚Äôm so proud of my state!!! Conversion abuse is absolutely abhorrent.
I dont mean to sound pessimistic but how in THE FUCK did this *just now* get banned?! Conversion therapy should have been banned fucking years ago. Im glad its gone in your state now tho, that is a very good thing im just surprised that it took this long
That's awesome!
It's an Executive Order, not a full-on ban. Sadly, if the state ever tips Red again, it'll be one of the first things overturned

Now if only we could get some legal recreational drug use
HECK YEAH WOOOOOOOOOOO
oh holy shit this is amazing
this is awesome! i'm so glad that the LGBTQ+ community is making progress :D
good news!! I live in jersey about 20 minutes out of philly so I'm glad to hear it :)
That‚Äôs awesome. And I live just over the border, in NY
I just flew back from that state today
I saw this somewhere and I was so happy I have always been scared that there was a chance I could be sent off but now I know I'm way more safe
That‚Äôs amazing!!!
Wooo!!!
LETS FUCKIN GOOO
cool guy
WOOO!! ü•≥ü•≥ very good news!!
Hope it becomes a trend. A domino tidal wave of banning such a medieval practice.
Ohoo.  Did You know Trans Girls Get Pregnant!
I use to live in Pennsylvania
The fact we even have to keep up with this is sad honesty but I‚Äôm glad somewhere is actually doing the right thing for once I have friends over there so I‚Äôm glad to know they‚Äôre safer now at least
Thats awesome , i hope they dont just dole out transition therapy wilky nilly tho as that can be equally as damaging ir worse
This is great but I still don't feel safe to start transitioning in central PA. This place might as well be the deep south.
Oh nice, we gotta keep some truth to our ""Welcome To Pennsylvania"" sign, ""Pursue Your Happiness""
Texas vs Pennsylvania
Sames! Let‚Äôs just hope it doesn‚Äôt go red I‚Äôm November! Also where my pa transfolk at? I need irl friends.
still is legal in many places in the US
Still legal in England
Vote, but also organize in your local LGBTQ scene. We're a lot harder to fuck with when we stand up together .
Governor of Pennsylvania the one Shapiro I know of that I can confidently say I like
I have a friend in a deep blue state who just doesn't get why I can't focus on politics and how scary it is. They just don't get how close we are to losing it all. They don't live around trumpers every day.
Came in to say the same thing lol. Got through two comments before I realized. Was much happier then. 

This is what happens when I'm exhausted. Dis gurl need her sleep üò™
Parents send their kid to a ""Therapist"" who's only goal is to make you not gay or trans

Suicide rates among those who go through it are astronomical because they just keep telling you to suppress it and that you being LGBTQ is ruining your life your parents lives and society as a whole
[deleted]
Fuck the new jersey invader.
Vote, but also organize in your local LGBTQ scene. It's a lot harder to take our rights when we stand together. Heck I know of a woman who's trans in Philly, she's out there organizing classes with the SRA on how to use a firearm.
Might I ask how? Not trying to be an ass, genuinely interested
I just moved to PA!
Scranton here
Altoona here!

I'm North Central PA.   


November is terrifying. It feels like we can't lose with how bad Oz/and Mastriano are, but that gives me 2016 anxiety all over again.  I'm honestly planning on leaving the state in the future. The GOP are already planning on bypassing the Gov by amending the constitution for things like this.

Unless this new PA law is different, it's still legal everywhere in the US because none of the laws apply to clergy which is where most of it is done anyhow

Heya!
I used to live in Indiana! Miss the city. Loved the food scene. Miss me some 9th street deli, bobs pizza, and murphies wings. Also I cant remember the name of the Mediterranean place, they also had great food.
It‚Äôs pretty awesome actually
9th Street is my favorite! Also there's an abundance of great Thai food

The governor of Utah‚Äôs response to a ban on transgender people in Utah sports is encouraging and positive	"It‚Äôs not perfect, but a lot of it obviously comes from a place of kindness. He vetoed a bill banning transgender kids from competing in women‚Äôs sports when, at the last minute, the commission overhauled the bill that originally proposed inclusion after review. A bill that was built with the LGBTQ community where everyone found a compromise together and agreed to tweak the system continuously instead became a blanket ban at the 11th hour. The pull quote below is exactly the kind of thing I wish more people would realize, and it‚Äôs coming from the republican governor of a red state. Maybe there is hope for the trans community. I encourage everyone to read the whole statement. There is some transphobic language, but it seems to come more from a place of ignorance, not hatred.

https://www.sltrib.com/news/politics/2022/03/22/gov-spencer-coxs/

‚ÄúFour kids and only one of them playing girls sports. That‚Äôs what all of this is about. Four kids who aren‚Äôt dominating or winning trophies or taking scholarships. Four kids who are just trying to find some friends and feel like they are a part of something. Four kids trying to get through each day. Rarely has so much fear and anger been directed at so few. I don‚Äôt understand what they are going through or why they feel the way they do. But I want them to live. And all the research shows that even a little acceptance and connection can reduce suicidality significantly. For that reason, as much as any other, I have taken this action in the hope that we can continue to work together and find a better way. If a veto override occurs, I hope we can work to find ways to show these four kids that we love them and they have a place in our state.‚Äù"	"Wow. Just read the whole thing and I have a couple of thoughts on this. 

1) It initially sounded like ""don't pass this because people will sue and we don't have the money to deal with that."" Just goes to show how short sighted their transphobia makes these legislators.

2) Towards the end of his statement, he does seem super sincere and as if he had given some thought into this decision that comes, as OP mentioned, a place of kindness. The excerpt you chose really captures that well, OP.

I guess one last thought, or hope rather, is that more of our political leaders, and equally as important, their constituents, can learn from this man and put as much thought (not that it takes all that much, let's be honest) as he has.
It‚Äôs encouraging for sure.  I hope other republicans take a fucking moment and consider what the fuck they are doing.  But I‚Äôm not very hopeful.
Sadly, I just heard that the veto was just over-ridden :(
I'm proud of him for taking a stand against his party and being compassionate, but unfortunately the party still outnumbers him and they're still going ahead with the ban, fuck America right now.
As someone who lived in Utah for a while, I think this message is more important than whether or not the law goes through. The law will probably go through, but I think everybody anticipated that. What people did not anticipate is a republican governor in a conservative state standing up for the rights of trans youth, and I think for a lot of kids who have grown up in an area where if you assume people want you dead you'll be right most of the time, seeing a prominent leader take a stand for you will mean a lot.
Yes, it's good that one Republican did the right thing. But then they decided to override his veto. So yeah.

I can't get that excited about one guy being decent, I guess, because he really is just doing the minimum in terms of being an ally.
You can tell that he doesn't really understand us, but he genuinely seems to want what's best for us. This honestly made my day
[deleted]
I'm impressed. There's a shadow theocracy in Utah, I almost can't believe this
This is America where people at least pretend to care about fairness. Everyone deserves a place at the table, it can just take some time to slide around the seating chart for a new friend.
The end of his statement got to me. It shouldn‚Äôt be surprising to see empathy like that but it was
This was just for show.  Maybe he's looking at a presidential bid.  

Whatever his real intentions, I don't know how any of you can trust a Utah Republican even a little.  You **can not** get to be the Republican governor of Utah with a clean conscience.

Look at loads and loads of our history.  These bastards only extend olive branches just to use our own compassion against us.  If you don't know your history, and know it from queer/black/indigenous sources, then just trust me this motherfucker is up to no good, but also, get read.

I read through these threads and always see y‚Äôall bitching about transphobia. It‚Äôs not transphobia. There are many actions taken towards you folk that is hateful and menacing and horrible, but this isn‚Äôt one. Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. It‚Äôs not fair. I support your right to be who you are and live your life free from hate but physical competition is an area where I disagree on inclusion
Cox‚Äôs statement doesn‚Äôt surprise me.  He‚Äôs done it before.  At a 2016 vigil for the victims of the Orlando nightclub massacre, he made an equally incisive statement.  

Cox is far from perfect.  But unlike almost every other conservative politician at the state or national level, he‚Äôs a decent human being.  Sadly, he‚Äôs probably 10-20 years before his time.  

The crusade against us will continue for the foreseeable future.  The Republicans want to exterminate us, and have shown they will do whatever it takes to make it happen.  

But what many in our community don‚Äôt realize is this crusade is a last-gasp effort to maintain the patriarchal Christian white-male status quo.  To be sure, it'll be rough going.  But they‚Äôre too late.  Their crusade is bound to fail.  We‚Äôre too big and too powerful.  Younger generations are far more accepting as a whole.  We‚Äôll eventually see more politicians like Cox, even if they‚Äôre Republican.  Things will get better.
""Because there are logical and passionate arguments by many parties...""

Oh, have there been? /s
... Yeah I don't like this, one bit. I respect he's a politician but I just flat out disagree with some of what he says, especially talking about how this issue turns ""allies into opponents"". 

Yes, it does turn allies into your opponents, because the allies believe in fairness. He also talked about Lia Thomas and... as usual, a republican completely neglects the context as to why she performed so well, citing it as an ""egregious example"". I agree with his points on finance since that's seemingly the only thing republicans start conversations with, but I dislike how it's the forefront of his discussion. 

I'm just saying, if they really want to ban trans people from sports divisions that align with their identity, they should make Transmasc's play in the womens leagues too. I'd love to see the hilarity that ensues from that as long as the Transmasc's consent to playing in womens leagues at least to make a point.
Despite not being conservative, as a Utahn, Cox is not bad at all. Plenty of democrats in Utah actually registered as Republicans to vote for him in the primaries, as this being Utah we always swing red, but he was one of the best candidates they put forward, and actually seems to care about this state and the people in it, regardless of race, sex, gender, religion, or sexuality. If the democrats don‚Äôt put any good candidates forward this next election I‚Äôll probobaly be voting for him tbh.
Human decency. What a rare sight to behold in this day and age.
I live in Utah, and this gives me at least a little bit of hope. I just want to be myself and be happy. Maybe someday, things will turn out ok, I really hope they will. I just wish everyone could be accepting towards me, especially my family. Who knows, maybe they‚Äôll come around. this give me hope that they might.
As a Utahn I‚Äôm proud to have this wonderful man to be our governor, he is the only governor I‚Äôve only heard good things about, h gives me so much hope
I live in texas and I‚Äôm VERY envious of a leader who seems to give a shit about their constituents. And, sadly, a budgetary problem probably resonates more with other legislators than a human rights issue.
The governor is providing multiple reasons why it is a bad bill. It starts with the most simple and logical reason and ends with a powerful appeal to emotion because emotion is what m drives behavior change. It's a very common and powerful rhetorical device used to sway opinion.

The end result is the reader or listener comes away from the speech with the logical reasons cemented into the argument by the emotional bond created by the ending. So the reader or listener is now on the side of the speaker emotionally and morally.
I lived in Utah for 13 years, and while the legislature is bought and paid for by the church there have been some suprisingly open governors.  Huntsman, and Cox were both better than expected.  I do feel like he has to hit point #1 you mentioned because he (and all of us know) that the only thing that might move the Utah state legislature is not humanity, but $$.  To me it shows both that he is a good person, and that he understands where the only levers he really can pull to effect any change exist.
He doesn't sound like he will support trans people BUT cares about life and with a pro life stance that he has he equate the sacrificing his beliefs for the greater good if preventing suicide with trans people using straight logic of trans people are a minority and wouldn't change much
They don't care what they're doing. They just know the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

Politicians will do any say literally anything to get/stay in office
For most the cruelty is the point. They‚Äôre desperate to have an under class they can absolutely shit on.
[removed]
Of course it was‚Ä¶
They‚Äôre trying to gather votes they haven‚Äôt yet edit: nope, they did it like last night, fuck.
This is the kind of politician that makes primaries SO important. The dream is to have a liberal governor, but many places that‚Äôs highly unlikely. If you know you‚Äôre in a red state that will very likely vote in a republican, we want more people like this rather than Abbott or his ilk.
I‚Äôm grateful he at least tried. I live in Utah, and it‚Äôs at least a little bit comforting that there are some who are accepting of me. I‚Äôve lived here all my life, there are a lot of good people here. I‚Äôd say the majority of the hate is fueled by ignorance, A lot of people here live in their own sheltered bubble, I did too for the longest time. I feel extremely lucky that I‚Äôve found a support system, even if my family isn‚Äôt the most supportive. Maybe someday things will be better, I really hope so.
My thoughts exactly.
Exactly. I‚Äôve lived in Utah my whole life. Between all the disgusted looks and hurtful jokes,  this is a nice change.
It felt like more than the minimum, especially releasing a statement like this. As political statements go, this one is pretty solidly pro trans kids. But I‚Äôm in texas, so maybe I‚Äôm just pining for some compassion here.
I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs being an ally at all. He‚Äôs not supporting the community. All he did was point out that trans people are human and deserve to be treated with dignity. It feels very much the same as ‚Äúhate the sin, love the sinner‚Äù.
And he seems to defer to people who DO know and seems to have tried to educate himself.
That‚Äôs pretty awesome. A politician keeping their word. *sigh*
Agility dogs should compete against cis men. 

Horses should compete against cis men. 

F1 cars should compete against cis men.
To paraphrase a great author, if you think trans women are women except when it comes to sports, you don't really think trans women are women. You just allow them to be women some of the time.
Across sports? The effect of trans athletes on sports and performance records is statistically insignificant.
>  Trans women are shattering women‚Äôs records across sports because they grew up in male bodies and come into the space with massive competitive advantages. 

This is just not true. There's a handful of subcategories where trans women have a small advantage over cis women, and they don't compete enough (and likely never will) to ""shatter records across sports."" Trans women occasionally win, but that's reasonable to expect across 1000s of competitions. You are couching your transphobia in logic but it's clear you have no actual understanding of the science or statistics, you're just being transphobic. 

> It‚Äôs not fair.

This is the weirdest take because sport already is dominated by people with the right genetics and upbringing. Competitive sports is never fair, but you're targeting trans women because you are transphobic rather than finding much more significant ways to make sports fair. 

If you care about fair women's sports so much, increasing funding for research and marketing is a way better way to make it fair than banning trans women. You're not making sports fairer by banning trans kids from playing sports with their peers. Which is what this bill does.

Educate yourself: https://youtu.be/HdT1PvJDRo4
I would pay. I would buy memberships. I would print pink and blue foam (middle) fingers. I would support my trans bros while they just flex on the cis.
It shouldn‚Äôt be a ban as much as just common sense
>the voters that vote for them want it and hate trans people

...which is in turn mainly true because the politicians and their pundit pals have *told* them to hate trans people so the politicians can always score an easy win when their numbers are down.
Fuck off. We are not mentally ill, and we sure as Hell don‚Äôt need or deserve to be thrown in prison or *ENSLAVED* (and yes, that is exactly what you just advocated for) just because we‚Äôre trans.
It is well known among democrats in Utah that they need to be registered as republicans.  The republican primaries are closed in Utah, but the democratic primaries are not.  All of my friends that are democrats in Utah are registered republican so that they can push more liberal republicans through the primaries.
True, in my experience it's pretty rare to even meet another trans person IRL (I'm in Australia though) and I guess it's easy for transphobia to spread when there's more people who have opinions on trans people than people who actually know trans people personally. Sorry your state is treating you like shit.
Not only that, this was the second time he vetoed this bill.
Yeah, I don't see how anyone can be anti-kids and hold a position of power. But that's just me. He didn't say he supports trans kids' right to take blockers to delay puberty or anything like that. He said he doesn't want them to kill themselves. So... Yeah.
Intersex and hermaphroditic athletes present interesting edge cases. It is not all b&w.
So because it‚Äôs insignificant, in your mind that means all the girls and women who are currently losing to trans men don‚Äôt matter. Gotcha. Like always it‚Äôs always about men.. nothing truly changes.
You want to defend womens sports from a fake threat? Sure, but by definition these bulky hot men need to now play against cis women, because after all, ‚Äúit‚Äôs how you were born‚Äù that‚Äôs the most important, not years of hormone treatment or sex reassignment surgery when deeming who can and can‚Äôt play.

I‚Äôd pay real money to watch this too
Who are you guys voting for? Becky Edwards is the popular choice right? At least, that's the vibe that I get. If Mike lee wins the primaries, the next favorite would be McMullin in the generals, right? (I have no one irl rn to ask these questions) I really hope we can unseat mike lee
You literally don't even understand what trans men means.

How did you get to this sub? Did you intentionally come here to be transphobic?

Some 2023 bills. It‚Äôs January 5th.		"Honestly surprised Florida wasnt the first to try to forcefully detransition people under a specific age. They did something else here for people under 18, but not straight out forcing people who were already on hrt to stop. Our state is known to be one of the craziest lol.
Look out Canada cuz here I come
It's sad to me that Colorado is sincerely one of the safest states for a transgender person to be, **because it still isn't safe.** The fact that our ""safest"" states hit the bare minimum is shocking, and I'm terrified for trans youth across the country.
But it‚Äôs ‚Äúnot a genocide‚Äù we‚Äôre just over reacting. Not like they tried to ban trans ppl from being aloud to exist in public last year or anything. (They did) not trying to fear monger or make anyone feel bad, I‚Äôm scared rightfully.

Wou, I guess the American's genocide of trans people is going great üò¨ Wtf is this country fr
the last big human rights violation committed by the south is being explained away in history class as being due to the industrial revolution. how the hell are they gonna explain this in 40 years?
We need to organize a rescue mission and get kids out of these states 

Seriously though, if you can get out, get out
Well this is funking terrifying
My heart goes out to American trans folk it sounds fucking terrifying
This is your occasional reminder that a single legislator can file a bill. Hundreds of anti-trans bills have been filed in the last few years. Most don't become law.

Many legislators are total yahoos. Being a state legislator is mostly a part-time job, and in many places there is no Democratic candidate.

If you're a Republican legislator in a state that's been run by Republicans for 20+ years, it's very difficult to get your name in the paper. You have to think up new ways to outrage people every legislative session, because all the normal conservative crap was made law 15+ years ago. Lately they have decided that anti-trans bills are a good way to get headlines.

\*\*\*That doesn't mean that these bills aren't bad or that we shouldn't fight them!\*\*\*  Of course they are and we should.

Still, people need to be aware of the business model here. Yahoo Republican legislator in an uncontested seat can't generate any attention, so he files an outrageous bill. Liberal journalists see it and write a story and get outrage clicks. Almost always (but not always!) the most outrageous bills go nowhere, partially because the sponsoring legislators don't actually give a shit about the issue. Repeat next year.

Oklahoma, for example, currently allows gender-affirming healthcare for people of ALL ages. NO state totally bans gender-affirming care for anyone over 18 (as far as I can tell).

Anyway, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  \*\*\*There are very real fights going on right now in Republican states over totally banning care for trans people under 18, and over funding and insurance for trans adults.\*\*\*  Those should be the focus.
How would they get legal adults over the age of 18 to do this? Not trying to be rude but that‚Äôs the age most places recognize you as an adult responsible for your own choices.
So an adult under 26 old enough to go into the military, but not to make medical decisions for themselves.... wtf. I feel so bad for trans people in the USA right now
I‚Äôm leaving the country altogether the first chance I get. I can‚Äôt do this shit anymore. I know it‚Äôs not gonna be perfect in other places but anything is better than being in a country that actively wants me and people like me to die.
No way I'm moving to America right now.
Can someone link me to it so next time some transphobe dumb conservative says trans ppl dont face discrimination from the government i can show them this
What is extra hideous is the provision back dating felony charges for medical personnel 40 years.
So‚Ä¶ example: a trans femme on HRT in Oklahoma that is 25, has had SRS or an orchiectomy and is now forced to stop estrogen? State mandated osteoporosis friends!
‚ÄúProtection of minors‚Äù uhm.. last I checked 18-26 year olds aren‚Äôt minors and you can‚Äôt medically transition under 18 without parental consent..
26 isn't ""youth"" you're a goddamn adult at 26. They want to detransition fucking adults. I'd believe In hell just so those fuckers woluld end up there.
Can't wait for them to use this to artificially bolster the stats of how many detransition. There is no way it's going to be separated into willing and unwilling detransitioners.

Most of life is a moral grey zone. But sometimes something happens & you can say without any fucking doubt; this is just evil.
why 26 years old ? Isn‚Äôt legal age 18 or 20 something ??
‚Ä¶ can I cry now?
I am going to write to my representative here in Canada to push for Legislation to allow (or expand if it's already a thing) asylum seekers to include people fleeing transphobic governments who are waging war on trans people.

Franky, I see this as nothing less than an attempted genocide by these state governments. In Canada, we had what's called the residential school system, where to grossly oversimplify, was an attempted cultural genocide by the Canadian government to wipe out First Nations culture by tearing children from their families and culture, and abusing them until they knew nothing but European heritage and culture. One quote describing the genocide was ""taking the Indian out of the Indian"". This is recognized as a genocide by the modern Canadian government and I believe also the UN.

This, in my mind, is an attempted genocide by the Republican party of the US.
So‚Ä¶.America will try to ban full grown consenting adults from transitioning‚Ä¶..but they‚Äôll make tv shows about 15 year olds getting pregnant‚Ä¶‚Ä¶honestly america needs to be burned and completely restarted from scratch.
That‚Äôs like super depressing, I‚Äôm in Montana and that just fucking sucks. Good thing I don‚Äôt plan on living here much longer. Moving to Colorado
I'm in GA THE SCHOOL LITRL HAS ANTI-GAY FLAGS AND TRUMP FLAGS
This is fucking terrifying. What terrifies me even more is how this could inspire other countries to start doing the same. 

Much love to the American trans folks, stay safe.
I know what you're going to say, but you all need to leave this shithole country, for your own sake. Like, really this shit seems to really be getting out of hand.
Words really can't express how this makes me sick. I have one wish for my past and that's that I could have realized I was trans and transitioned much earlier. Not saying I'm too late, but it would have made my life 1000% better today. Now the world around me is saying that's the number one thing that SHOULD NOT be allowed to happen...literally the best thing that *could have happened* they are now expressly fighting against. Gotta wait until 25: the age when medically your body is essentially set and transitioning losing a substantial amount of effectiveness. Fuck them. Fuck this. This is evil. (and yes...you damn well know they aint going to fucking stop here. They won't stop until being trans is a byword and a crime and not even considered human...fucking monsters.)
I'm Canadian but holy sh*t this terrifies me. I'm so sorry to everyone living in these places. If you ever can, we welcome you up here in the north.
This shit is just so difficult to cope with dude why can't ppl just be chill, we literally don't hurt fucking anybody by existing. I just can't anymore. I dont even live in America but it'll slowly rise up the border, and even if it doesn't I fear for my queer siblings in the States. I try to help them grapple with the terrifying reality theyre now forced to live with each and every day and just sit there unable to truly help while they fear for their lives. We have to fight and live our truth. We can't give up. But, fuck, sometimes this all feels like some sick fucking joke the universe is playing at our expense. 

I used to go to bed wishing I'd wake up a girl. Now, when I go to bed, I wish that all this will somehow have just been a horrible nightmare.
I'm not american but anyone up for a revolution 

Seriously this is going too far and if britain (where i'm from) ever dares to do this, I will personally take up arms against parliament
I didn‚Äôt realize how bad it was until I joined this community wtf is wrong with people that they would rather try and stamp us out of existence than try and understand. Absolutely sickening.
I live in Oklahoma... I didn't even hear about this... Fucking hell... What's the point anymore...?
america just keeps getting worse and worse holy shit
Hey, does anyone know any active anti-trans bills in the state of Georgia? It‚Äôs a moderate risk according to the map. I live there and just found out i‚Äôm trans. It might take me a while to come out! I want to know the specifics of georgia please :) thank you <3
So curious here - if I live in one state, but go to school(college) in a different one, how would the bans of the state I'm at school in affect me?
This shit makes me wish I had the power to just teleport people out of the US
All of this legitimately makes my blood boil and the fact that my age makes it where I can‚Äôt do shit makes it worse
I am sick to my stomach.
If any trans people from the states wants to move to Denmark, I'm down for a platonic marriage so you can get permanent residence.
I was raised an east coast girl, but the west coast is looking real nice right about now.
Looking at the map, it's like they're trying to push trans people into the sea...
Free country my ass
i‚Äôm so glad i live in new york. sometimes i forget because i am in a red county. sending love and support to those who aren‚Äôt as fortunate as me <3
What's the source for the map at the end? Calling Wisconsin low risk is pretty optimistic, though I guess probably true since I don't think our supreme court is quite stupid enough to try to say the legislature can ignore the governor without a supermajority that we luckily dodged. But coloring WI the same as Minnesota definitely feels off (as a woman considering moving specifically for this reason)
as someone whk just moved from tn to co a few months ago jesus christ
Sure do love living in one of the deep red states (I fucking hate it here)
Reading this i see how lucky i am to be french
Oh god. America is kinda fucked up. Glad I'm Aussie and I feel so bad for anyone who is young, trans and living in America.
""Youth health protection act"" 

Classic doublespeak brought to you by the same people who cry 1984 because they're not allowed to say slurs anymore. What about this bill favors youth or their health exactly?
What a disgusting misanthropic way to think. It really sucks what you hear from the US lately. Such laws are just the worst kind of hostility towards people who have never done anything to anyone. Just sad that more and more US states are using Nazi methods against trans people. 

I wish all those who suffer under such laws all the best that you will get through it. Hopefully the courts will intervene ... This can't be legal.
Straight up fascism. These motherfuckers on the right claim to love freedom but it's all a bunch of shit. Save up money to move elsewhere if you can and once you have that set aside save up for a gun. 
No telling how bad things will get.
This can't possibly stand up to scrutiny by the supreme court. It is against freedom of expression.
I live on the border of TN and GA. It‚Äôs fucking scary here. The amount of people around here that love and support MTG and everything conservative is wild. I don‚Äôt go outside presenting as my actual gender because I‚Äôm genuinely worried about being hurt by someone. These people want trans people dead
Nazis are back... everywhere üò•
Gonna use that last pic when deciding where I go for college. This is some scary stuff
‚ÄúOh but it‚Äôs permanent‚Äù do u have any idea how tucking damaging forced de transition is. It‚Äôs not even about the kids like they claim this is so fuckibg disgusting i am so sorry for my American siblings
Good luck forcing someone who is a grown ass adult to detransion seems pretty fucking 'but mah rites' to me...I'm so fucking mad reading this shit. Think I'm going to open a firearms training specifically for my trans and NB siblings.
Evil people. Trying to eliminate Trans people.
I'm scared.
Gosh, i'm Australian and this absolutely frightens me given that Australia copies america with everything
Wait I‚Äôm confused, is the bill in Oklahoma active right now? This is where I live and I JUST RECENTLY started T after waiting over a fucking year. I fucking hate it here and want out.
it's crazy how America seems to care more about trans people over real problems like homelessness and drug abuse
This makes me want to cry for all of us who live in those states. I am lucky enough to live in Minnesota which has relatively good accessibility and protections. I can‚Äôt imagine how you all must be feeling right now, if you live in one of these states. I am so incredibly sorry that hate is currently ruling with such power. Please don‚Äôt give up, do whatever you can to get out, get to a better place that will allow you to transition, whatever you have to do.
They arent the clowns anymore. They are the entire FUCKING CIRCUS.
ACLU should be all over that with lawsuits.
Sure do love living in Tennessee.
We are infantilizing transgender adults? How long is someone going to be ‚Äúyouth‚Äù for
The more and more this happens it feels like the us is getting less safe and more
fuck no. I have even transitioned yet but having to wait over 10 years?! I would rather d!e. thank god I dont live there-
I‚Äôm so tired.
Holy shit colorado is getting boxed by that map
I‚Äôm not even from the US (Canadian) but knowing how influential US politics can be I‚Äôm worried it will set a global precedent and mobilize/empower more far right movements.

I‚Äôm also just so scared for my trans friends in the US, it‚Äôs actually nauseating how bad things are getting in the states.
Trans people do no one any harm by transitioning, so why punish them for it? America, what the fuck
This is nothing short of goddamn terrifying. I can only hope this shit gets swatted down in the courts.
Makes me sick.
This is fucked up
This is really really bad , it shows that the rhetorical goal posts have moved from under 18  and they are now close to wanting to ban transition all together .  Shit like this is why I am going to start my german citizenship paperwork for next Wednesday .
No way this will stand if it passes.
I live in Texas and am absolutely horrified..

Now the government FORCING detransitioning as well as anything else is screwed up. I live in TX. How can I contribute to fighting against the bill or parts of the bill I disagree with?
I‚Äôm not familiar with medical consent regulations in the USA but isn‚Äôt banning medication for people under 26 just straight up illegal? They tried to do it here in the UK by banning hormones to anyone under 18 but the legislation fell apart before the first reading because someone pointed out that medical consent starts at 16 (and that to ban HRT for trans youth they‚Äôd have to change the medical consent law which would go down like a plate of cold sick with just about everyone from medical authorities to the general public)
Wtf is going on in America. This just hurts by looking at it. I hope this gets fixed. Its more than a big step backwards. This is a fucking Bungee jump backwards. I can‚Äôt believe that this is real
God I love New England
As Tomas Jefferson said in the Hamilton musical ""WERE GOING TO NEW YOUR"" but it all seriousness this is really bad and I pray to my gods and I wish I could do something for the pour souls in these states good luck y'all stay safe and have a good day/night
I hate Florida... (Even though I live there)
Everytime I see American politics I feel the urge to jump off the nearest bridge
I‚Äôm not American, so could someone tell me how safe is California
WHAT ARE THEY SMOKING IN OKLAHOMA TF
I'm very glad I live on the west coast rn.

lol
dose low risks mean it could happen soon
Man, I just wanna go to Disney World in peace.
Someone from Missouri here, seems like I only get 2 years of finally getting to be a girl, at least when my parents aren't around, so I'll SAVOR EVERY FINAL DROP!!!!!!!!!!!!! I would have swore a lot in this rant, but a. People already covered that 2. I don't feel comfortable swearing, and 3. It won't help, at least not here.
dear god it hasn't even been a week
I give up.
What the actual fuck
I‚Äôm scared
I live in Wisconsin for school, but I‚Äôm from Montana and I‚Äôm there now visiting family. I know that the bill doesn‚Äôt affect me since I‚Äôm an adult and not a minor, but if the bill goes through, then what‚Äôs stopping them from coming after adults, too? I‚Äôm not sure exactly how interstate laws work, but if they outlaw HRT for people under 25 or whatever, then would I be illegally smuggling and using my T if I were to come visit family? Or does it not apply since I live in WI and am only visiting? I would be glad for the excuse to not visit my crazy conservative family anymore, but there‚Äôs definitely stuff about MT that I would miss dearly. 

Sorry for the long comment I‚Äôm just scared cuz I wasn‚Äôt expecting to see MT on here since they just elected a trans person into state government.
What the actual fuckkk why can't we just live in peace
So let‚Äôs stop being pussies protests don‚Äôt work we need to stand up
yeah trans kids using the bathroom are an emergency not mmiw not racism. trans kids
This is absolutely terrifying
Not surprised it's majorly in the South.
this is outrageous, we need some serious protests here. this is borderline genocide.
California is good to go, just movie over here üôÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
So glad I live on the west coast right now
People need to sue. That‚Äôs a serious human rights issue
Bro what, I live in Kentucky and I‚Äôm the one who‚Äôs gotta worry about the redneck mofos in the bathrooms
Florida kind of did but in a sneakier way. They ordered their state Medicare to no longer fund HRT services as well as transition care, effectively pushing many trans people to black markets or to detransition.

Oklahoma's law will go through the courts and will eventually be stopped. Florida's policy change will last a lot longer and do far more damage.
Yeah, I‚Äôm surprised Texas hasn‚Äôt fully detransitoned everyone yet, the bills they have are actually insane. I know they aren‚Äôt passing but the more insane the bills get, the more tame anti trans bills that aren‚Äôt just literally getting rid of trans ppl will seem. So more and more bills will pass and they‚Äôll get worse and worse. I hope it‚Äôs not too bad before I‚Äôm legally allowed to leave. üò≠ scary shit rn. Just reading these bills not even the reactions of transphobes the bills themselves are horrific
We have a lot of trans healthcare specialist and actually more open laws about it. Ppl legit fly down here to get surgery. I moved down here in my early transition 10 years ago because it benefited me more than staying where I was at. Obviously though with the Trump era there have been some major shifts in politics down here. It was a very different scene when I started.
They did for anyone on Medicare
bruh at this point I gotta move planets
I'm in Canada and rights for LGBT people are actually regressing slowly. I see more homophobes and transphobes than ever before. And I'm in the Maritimes which is known for being progressive
Gunna be honest, we're only marginally better.
Yup, in Denver, can confirm My girlfriend is transgender and we just had to move because she was harassed by a couple guys as she was entering our prior apartment. This happened just like a week after the Club Q shooting, which shook us up because we have a friend who performs drag and stuff. Still had to pay to break the lease the regional manager for Greystar was totally uncaring, called reps and senators asking about resources or help and didn't even get a response, reached out to some non-profit orgs and they were basically like ""that sucks sorry but we don't have any resources."" She has been getting harassed in public more frequently lately too. We don't go out as much anymore. It really sucks.

It absolutely fucking is genocide and I'm tired of pretending otherwise to comfort others.
Wait, what? They tried to disallow us from being in public?
There is only one solution, the establisment shall burn on the fires of a revolution
If I read it correctly I think it means people under the age of 26 will be forced to detransition
IMO Honestly it'll def take a while, but I assume just like woman's rights, the increasing rights for nonwhite, and LGB folk eventually most  people'll realize it made no sense to not give trans people rights, and in the mean time there'll almost always be some safe spaces or safe states around for transfolk
Fortunately a lot of the world is pretty decent when it comes to progressive rights. Even the most right wing people in Norway for ex still believe in basic rights for lgbtqi+
The reason this is happening is to give their base an ""other"" to hate. The easiest way to force in-group uniformity and cohesion is to provide an out-group or ""other"" to hate. You convince them this ""other"" is out to get them, that we stand to destroy their way of life, that we want to harm their children. Once you have that out-group established your in-group will let you rob them blind in the name of protecting them from the out-group.
I think they're hoping they get to write the history books.
Ahh, the war of northern aggression as I was taught in South Carolina. I fucking hate that place. So sick of these people taking basic human rights away from us. It is going to come back and bite them sooner than later I believe.
That tbh
Also Happy cake day
This 100% the worrying thing is they are getting worse and worse. They started out with just sport bans and now we are all the way to adult transition bans, we need to most fight what we can right now but these bills are a reminder of what‚Äôs coming, and what these ppl are fighting for. 3 years ago it was all about sports and their was like 60 bills. Now we‚Äôre here and their is around 400.
Yes, but by introducing these things, it incrementally shifts the Overton window.
i don‚Äôt even know, but it probably won‚Äôt pass, the point isn‚Äôt that it‚Äôs going to pass. The more and more extreme anti trans bills the more ppl get comfortable with transphobic laws. Before we would never imagine banning transition for anyone under 18 but now ppl will think it‚Äôs a compromise. They are normalizing this. The more bills they make the worse and worse it will get
My head automatically goes to I will kill myself in the end even if I‚Äôm not suicidal or depressed. I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd have an other option. It‚Äôs sad. They are treating adults like they are children all because they don‚Äôt understand or agree.
Yep, I'm 25 yo trans woman. I'm an E-6 in the military, served 2 tours overseas (one in a combat zone), have life altering issues from my service but apparently not old enough to transition. Okay fuck heads.
Canada is quite better than this. It depends on the province. Alberta is affordable, but is one of the more conservative ones. BC is more socialist, however very expensive to live. There are options though, and honestly, anything here is better than the US.
don‚Äôt üò≠ I‚Äôm so scared rn
If it doesn‚Äôt let the comment work I can dm you bc I had to find all the sources so I have them üò≠

They probably think the solution to that is to take testosterone instead
If you or a loved one is experiencing osteoporosis resulting from...I can hear it now üò≠
You‚Äôre an adult until you have an opinion or view on something that someone doesn‚Äôt think you should have. The definition of brainwash and indoctrinated is misused and all over the place now just because people have their own minds :(
Probably because the brain stops developing around 25 is the scientific reason, but there‚Äôs no scientific reason for this; it‚Äôs just bigotry. 26 was probably just the highest they could get away with. They want to prevent anyone starting at a young age (or honestly, at all)
18 but the age of consent is 16 in Oklahoma. You can get Marie‚Äôs to a 30 year old and have kids but you can‚Äôt transition for 10 years apparently. üòÄ yay
26 is also the limit on how long you can stay on parental health insurance. This was done by Obama to keep people insured, as a compromise with the whole ACA. But I think republicans are trying to invalidate that age group, to revoke voting rights (this is damn near impossible) to further infantilize/defang this voting block. Each new generation is prominently liberal. They are literally a dying breed and they know it.

This is solely appealing to the ‚Äúconcerned parent‚Äù who wants to continue to micromanage their adult child‚Äôs life. It would be ridiculously hard to get something like that to pass, without it being challenged, because this would likely cause huge problems for them. Like the fact that if they can‚Äôt consent to their healthcare, then they probably can‚Äôt consent to stuff like military service. This would open up so many problems for them.

I‚Äôm hoping this is the republicans‚Äô death rattle. Their venom will harm people, I‚Äôm not sure if there is any way forward without casualties (like roe v wade). But they are at the desperation phase, and their extremist block is doing a good job of pushing people out and away from that culture.
Yes. Please dont bottle it all up. We need to all get involved so that we can also all take the time we need to recharge.
The US had residential schools until the 1990s, they just don't talk about them like we do in Canada.
That can't be legal...
They already do.  Being gay in some middle eastern countries is a death sentence.
I wish. I‚Äôm 15 and my parents don‚Äôt make enough to move üò≠ I want to move as soon as I can but idk if I‚Äôll make enough to leave. I‚Äôm scared
If I remember correctly Georgia doesn't have any state wide non-discrimination laws for trans people, although some areas, such as Atlanta, do. Also they're one the states that has anti-trans sports laws. Though, I can't think of any current bills and the ranking might be based on past actions of the Georgia government
I‚Äôm a cali resident and a NY student. I just fly back for my medical nonsense because it‚Äôs cheaper than paying healthcare in NY lol
You technically have to follow the laws of the state you‚Äôre in‚Ä¶
Trans camaraderie be like: 

Although, from talking with trans people from Norway and Sweden, it seems trans healthcare is bad as well. Is the case not the same in Denmark in your opinion?
Freedumb
Same
Only kinda?

I‚Äôm here in a relatively liberal state and I‚Äôd definitely say more than ‚Äúkinda.‚Äù 

Also: FUCK OKLAHOMA.
They would make it illegal for doctors to prescribe hrt or do surgery‚Äôs, they‚Äôd make it a felony. So no amount of fighting would help if it got passed.
No, it was submitted. It hasn‚Äôt passed yet. I hope it doesn‚Äôt
Americans have been conditioned to see homeless people and drug users as being undeserving of help, if not deserving to actively be made to suffer. This is an absolutely barbaric country.
With malevolent clowns.
Because they view us as subhumans and they want to exterminate us. There do not have to be any valid reasons for this, this is just what they think, and they think this because they are stupid and think that being abnormal equals being bad.
It *probably* is, but given how heavily stacked the courts are here I would not put it past them to let laws like this stand anyway, even if only in part. They pretty routinely issue decisions that have no basis in law or objective reality and that they know don't hold up under legal scrutiny, purely because they think they can get away with it (and they often do).
California is probably one of the safer states in the US, but that only applies to the bigger cities (LA, SF, SD) and college towns. A lot of the state is rural / agricultural and actually pretty conservative, but not as many people live in those areas it's mostly farmland.
I live in Cali..... At my school a fourth of the students are LGBTQ, and is really supportive even though the highschool only has 18 people lol.
Getting on hrt at least for adults is extremely easy with planned Parenthood, and 16-17 it's not to hard. Kids are allowed in the bathroom, locker room, and sports of their gender identity to my knowledge. I don't think there's any big anti trans laws in effect or going into affect, and outside of family in person I don't think I've actively had someone be really transphobic or call out my trans merch in California, so I'd say from my experience it's pretty good
Bully for you. I love all these posts where half the comments are people going ""damn, glad *I'm* not living in a fascist hellhole... whelp! Good luck""
Wtf
Generally you have to follow the laws of whatever state you're in unless they specifically spell out exceptions for residents of other states. I haven't read the bill in question but I'm guessing they do not include a carveout for people on HRT from other states.
I cant even go to the bathroom before each period because all the idiot guys are circle jerking passing a vape
They did that yeah, but it didnt force everyone to stop, and there actually still are some that cover it afaik. Still got GoodRx and some others iirc to help bring the cost down a bit. Some people also by default choose to go through plume which isnt really affected by it at all because its a monthly sub based thing and has free labs included in the cost (unless ur in ny iirc) as long as u go to a quest lab. the actual prescription still costs some, but other than that the actual stuff in Florida so far is really only limiting minors.
That's just gonna lead to either an increase in death from black market hrt ( not knowing what's in it ) and suicide rate.

Not to mention those that can afford to leaving the state all together. Which will lead to an nice dent to the housing market ü§î. 

Florida is already the butt of all jokes even among the military ( was navy back in the day).
Hoping it doesn't get too much worse here in Florida, but regardless of how bad it gets law wise, I will find a way to get hrt regardless of hows its obtained. If they manage to ban it straight up, Ill move to diy even if there is a small chance of it ending up worse for my body I already hated to begin with.
Didn't Texas officials get a list of every person who started transgender hormone replacement? It was one of the red states and it's... really fucking alarming
Yeah, its actually not that bad down here in Florida, although there still is the risk that laws get made and passed at any time though.
Yeah it sucks, but theres other options.
It does feel like that.. üòñ
Germany is alright NGL beside our name change laws shit here is pretty nice for trans people
The US is weird, the democracy there has been on the downhill for a long time, along with the economy. Everyone in a developed nation outside of it has been carefully watching what not to do. 

Canada, Australia, a portion of European countries and South American countries are pushing forward with socially progressive policy including transgender positive policies. Australia just saw an overwhelming rejection of culture war policy in both state and federal elections where the losing parties chose to target the queer community, in particular trans people, and had their biggest ever election defeats which was so amazing. 

Honestly, either pick a blue state to live in or evacuate.
Avoid Mars, I hear Elon's interested
Hi, Fellow maritimer here!

You're very right. I've been seeing lots of gains in anti transgender sentiments over the past few years, basically since 2016. 

Gee, I wonder what could have possibly happened in 2016 that could have allowed people who follow radical right wing philosophy to feel validated!?

But to be serious, Trump's presidency gave way for stupid things like the formation and rise of the PPC here, at least that's how I see it anyway. My sister in law is an active PPC member, who's husband actually ran for office in an Ontario municipality. Glad he lost. Her involvement with the PPC breaks my heart actually because she's actually been incredibly supportive and never misgendered or dead named me or anything, but she's pushing policies that actively hurt me. So it's a weird situation where she personally supports me (or is at least respectful to me about it), while politically she doesn't. It messes with me a bit, I don't know how to feel about it.
Fuck! Is there no place safe for us?
This is true but it's not nearly as bad as it is in the States. Any trans person from a conservative US state would be far safer in Canada than where they are now.
Fuck guys I'm so sorry. Everything the US touches goes to shit. It seems mainly majority English speaking countries that are being affected from what I can observe, mainly the US, then the UK and Canada. Are people coming and harassing you all on the street? I really hope not. Because over here it's social media, on the street, in libraries and outside drag events, in the legislation, it's invaded every form of public life. I just have no idea how to stop it, not without doing something that could get me in trouble.
Yeah, Canada is going down hill and with expansion of our MAID program to include mental illness this March, it will be only a matter of time before gender  dysphoria is added as reasoning applying for it, they already offer it here for diabetics and the homeless. If I have learned anything is that Canada is not progressive and only pretends to be in order to say we are not America on the world stage.
Greystar is a piece of shit company. I'm sorry you had that experience.
Thank you!!! I tried to put the links in but they got taken down bc they were shortened? Idk I copy and pasted them from the sites so üò≠
Anyone who denies that these are steps towards genocide are either extremely ignorant and have know idea what they are talking about, or they want the genocide
I thought 25 was the age your brain fully matures? Why the heck 26
assuming, of course, theyre smart enough to know how
It's true... enough seemingly non-active things can end up normalising and trivialising attitudes so an actually active thing can occur. Public perception is incredibly powerful in democratic society and people can and will abuse it through manipulation of such.
What makes you say that? There's no opposition. Republicans have a supermajority in both houses and the governorship. They can do literally whatever they want with nobody in the legislature to stop them. Then it will inevitably go to the Supreme Court and our entire right to healthcare will be placed into the hands of John Roberts and Neil Gorsuch. Two people can determine our right to live in a single moment. That's how close we really are.
Sure, America has got some of the highest salaries in the world, but I know that by coming here, I'll be in danger of being attacked by GOP totalitarianism at any time.
dm it to me pls
thanksies :3  


 I HOPE THIS NEVER GETS PASSED EVER FUCK THE CLOWN WHO WROTE THIS.   


  
stay strong my american brothers and sisters and everyone in between and make ur voices heard that this is NOT OK and should never be passed
I always found it weird while they raised the drinking and smoking age for much of this reason you can still enlist and die for your country at 17-18‚Ä¶ but I digress.
yes I know their logic, but legally? Why? they should try and raise legal age if it‚Äôs that important for them‚Ä¶
Thanks‚Ä¶
I just decided to focus on Canada cuz that's where I'm from and I have more knowledge about it.
Study hard and try to get a high demand job in something like stem so that you will have the best chance. GL, and I hope you can leave this hell.
thank you :)) i dont play sports so not much of a problem for me. although i feel so bad for other trans athletes :(
Damn, I figured. Let's hope South Dakota doesn't go to shit yet. Got a good deal on a school I've really wanted to go to
Not necessarily
I would say it is quite good actually. I started hormones about a half a year after my first consultation and got top surgery about 2 years after. Which felt like a long time, but for our healthcare system in general is to be expected. I didn't have to go to ny counseling or be tested in any way. Everybody i met were just super understanding and helpful. It was honestly a good experience overall.
Fuck most American politicians. Not all. But quite a lot. And you know what fuck every corrupt politician.
Marching and fighting worked in the past, it will work again. Sadly many people will have to suffer before this is over I imagine. Shit makes me so sad.
That‚Äôs what I figured, but I wasn‚Äôt sure. Thanks for the info and an excuse to not visit family in the future (but seriously this shit sucks)
They got a list of everyone who got their name or gender marker legally changed, not hrt but still.
I'm German and it took me over half a decade to get on T despite getting support from my parents:')
 Biggest red state Imbound
Fuck if I know, transphobia has no logic, just hate
I think it's because people age out of their parents' insurance at 26 if they don't already have their own
Your prefrontal cortex stops developing at around 25, to be precise. This being the part of your brain that is typically associated with behavior and decision making. Of course, this 25 ceiling is not actually accurate for everyone, it's rather a general figure, and most people's brains stop developing in their mid to late 20s. It can't be said that everyone's brain stops developing at 25 because people develop differently based on a number of biological and genetic factors. 

Nonetheless, I don't think this fact should be relevant at all to the discussion, because it heavily implies that being trans is purely a choice. While it may be so for some trans people, it's not for the majority of us. Nobody freely chooses to experience extreme discomfort with their bodies, and this is an extremely invalidating point to bring up that also strips away young people's sense of personal and bodily autonomy, as well as responsibility.
One doesn't need to be smart to write a history book.

I was homeschooled and due to the prevalence of conservatives homeschooling their children for religious reasons it was basically impossible to get a history book that wasn't creationist nonsense and ""states rights"" rhetoric regarding the civil war.

They'll write the history books the same way they always have by pandering to a base that remains willfully ignorant while skewing the Overton window with fascist tactics.
also everything is so expensive, the higher salaries don‚Äôt really count üò≠ eggs are 5-7 dollars rn for 1 carton. (Where I am, midwest state so not a big city) Even bottled water and the cheap food is expensive. Love inflation üò≠/j
Highest salaries but also criminally high costs of living
It says it was blocked by domain filter idk what that means üò≠
No literally!! It‚Äôs the craziest concept.
I don‚Äôt know, but it‚Äôs horrific ‚òπÔ∏è
You want the real reason?

Because they love to say ""We can always tell"".

But they're realizing they can't.

So they want to try to push it as much as possible to legally institute ""We can always tell.""
Can I cry now?
Really?
Works for me.
Crazy it took me 4 months after coming out to get on e ._ .
thats true
God yeah it‚Äôs bad. I‚Äôm in WA (safe state, even marked by that map) and even though it‚Äôs supportive, everything is ridiculously expensive.. my insurance also doesn‚Äôt cover trans healthcare. It sucks! Having to postpone my transition yet again, but due to pricing :(
Eh, better wages and lower cost of living than the UK (and better trans circumstances too). It‚Äôs all a matter of perspective I suppose.
that‚Äôs what i was thinking, they hate it that hormone therapy is so effective and that we‚Äôre able to go stealth. But the question I was asking is that I was wondering how it is not unconstitutional to discriminate the use of a procedure for legally adult people, like‚Ä¶ why not prohibit tattoo and surgery then ?? I don‚Äôt get it, it‚Äôs based on nothing and I don‚Äôt understand why the US cannot counter these bills
Probably üò≠
Depends where your medical is through. Where you are at doesn‚Äôt determine where you get care necessarily. If you have the availability (as in my case where I have and use my California medical but live in NY for ~9 months of the year, and just fly back for appointments and such) you don‚Äôt need to follow the rules of the state you are staying in üòÖ at least in this case
I tried getting on T at 16 with parental consent (came out at 14, therapy since 15) but didn't get any until age 21. I blame it on ableism because apparently I can't be trans if I'm autistic... Also I got many doubts for not being masculine enough. Had multiple doctors actually. But once I switched to the adult department it took like a year or so, and now all is covered by insurance! I'm surprised that it even covered my no nipple variation. I guess Germany IS nice after all:D
I have heard T is more heavily controlled than E. Perhaps this is related?
Come to Germany or France :) It's not perfect here, but it's a bit better than in the UK.
:((((((((
I think t is actually a controlled substance like drugs aka  illegal to own without a permit i could be hella wrong tho i know e is free to get without anything
Yeah, so that certainly doesn't help our trans bros...
Yh it makes it impossible to diy it rly if I'm corect if that is maybe someone has more insight cuz idk if it's correct what I'm saying here but my guess is it would fall under steroids aka drugs"	1049yis	trans	1401	0.99	2023-01-05 20:58:15
So I‚Äôm other words the Tories want to block trans folk from having an easier time transitioning‚Ä¶again		"Hate the UK very hostile to be trans we just trying to be ourselfs and yet they out to destroy us wish I could afford to leave uküò•
I can‚Äôt help but notice that most these people look to be 40 and over ü§î
Can you imagine, we live in a timeline where the United Kingdom could become the Un-united Kingdom, because of transphobia. England is potentially willing to stomp on Scottish sovereignty and give the SNP a huge talking point, because the Tories cannot stand trans folks.
Abs they want to do it by squashing Scottish legal rights. Classic.
Sunak is really banking on the fact that whatever he does it can't be any worse than what Truss did
Is it any wonder that people have managed to claim asylum in other countries to get away from this shit hole TERF Island?
Fuck the Tories honestly I will single handily liberate Scotland from the UK
It's sick how these opponents are acting as though trans people are male rapists. The same people who force children into getting christened etc before they can decide for themselves
""lots of people"" Who? Terfs?
Me when I realized I might be trans: :)

Me when I realized I live on terf-island: :(
They are trying to institute conversion therapy on trans people so of course they'd do this.
Honestly, this entire country is a shithole. Can't wait to fucking flee when I get the opportunity. Honestly I'm so disgusted to be British.
Scotland: ""hey we have an idea about making people feel happier and better.""

UK: ""who told you that you can say things?""

Apparently, I had to read up on this, Scotland is being outright denied on being allowed a referendum for independence by Westminster. They need consent by the UK to see if they can vote for independence, that just infuriates me.
The Tories are a bunch of pricks who want to bandwagon on transphobia for political points. In other news water is wet üòÇ

Hopefully they aren‚Äôt able to block it ü§¶
Can all of us in the LGBTQIA+ community just save up and buy a big island together? It'll be where we can go to chill, get hrt, therapy, and all the good stuff.
Hate that conservatives regardless of country and culture are always on the look out for a scapegoat for when the government they were put in charge of by a reactionary public fucks everything up so they can keep them distracted.
Everyone who considers themselves culturally progressive should be angry about this.
I never imagined it would be easier to transition in the US than the UK.....
To anyone worried: look at them, they're all old dusty rotting Karens.
Congrats to Rishi for making literally every trans person in Scotland pro independence
""people having concerns"" needs to die as a journalistic crutch.

Say you hate a policy/idea and be judged on it, don't hide behind an imagined crowd of people.
> Woman are born not worn, not your costume 

The fact that transphobes are co-opting phrases such as ‚Äúmy culture is not your costume‚Äù from poc is so gross.
fuck rishi sunak and fuck the tories.
Open threats to violate Scottish autonomy. I don't think the Scots will stand for this. It has much wider implications than just shitting on trans people.
Why did they have to use that picture? Why a terf protest? Why make them look legitimate, rather than the howling loons that they are?
 Damn, I though the UK was better about lgbtq stuff, I guess it can get as bad as the US over there
Independence isn't enough. We need a moat.
Apparently my identity is a costume‚Ä¶
damn, The lettuce wouldn't have done this to us.
If nothings going on, the Tories are there to fuck it up. Holy shit, can't we just be ourselves in peace? I'm sorry, my family.
Charles III should follow tradition and dissolve parliament
When I woke up this morning, I didn't think I'd be seeing people flying the suffragettes colours in the name of oppression...
I feel like this is going to give republicans in the United States ideas‚Ä¶
Anyone up for ano√æer Jacobite War?
Our Tories are the Republicans here in the U.S. They're the worst.
Wow I love being trans rn(sarcasm)
It was never about trans people. The Scotish first minister wants outrage over westminster blocking scotland's laws to create disire for independance.
Wow!!!! Women are born and not worn.. that's awful
The world is fucked
Time for a referendum
That's odd it's not like the tory party to be cunts...
The whole women are born not your costume statement is so funny to me. Like we are not women because we change the type of clothes we wear. We are women because that is who we are. Clothes don‚Äôt make up a person you can wear whatever the fuck you want. You are who you identity as and who you feel you are. I am a woman who is of transgender experience. I wear the clothes I feel comfortable in and make me feel good about myself. Screw what anyone thinks of me. I am starting hormones to medically and physically change my body to align with how I feel on the inside. I was born with a body that doesn‚Äôt align with how I feel on the inside.

Wouldn't be wonderful if that crowd got hit by an asteroid.
I often wonder if we've got enough people in the British trans community to organise and stage a coup...

It's mostly a shower thought, but we do seem to count an awful lot of computer geniuses and whatnot in our number.
I wish this were a wake-up call for the SNP and Sturgeon for them all to realize how much trans rights and Scottish independence are tied together, but I'm rather pessimistic about this that they'll continue to beg Westminster for scraps of autonomy instead...
oh and Labour can go relocate to Doggerland for all I fucking care, the reactionary lot of them

The reason they gave was essentially calling all trans women SA predators and pedophiles. ""In the interest of protecting women and children"" I think was the wording.

They are the scum of the Earth, as if we needed more evidence
I'm just disgusted, bet jk is super happy about it and thinks ""yeah I love to suppress harmless minoritys and get them to commit suicide because they can't take it no more "" fuck this bs. Honestly, trans people are hated like jews in nazi Germany. Just absolutely horrible. There needs to be heavy resistance from us. Not just in save spaces like here, everywhere!
There was a time I wanted the green party in power, now I'd be grateful to lose the tories

I saw this earlier. Wanted to know if there is something we can do about it. Want to help out.

Honestly this really isn‚Äôt surprising. The Tories are being backwards.

Me too, honestly the waiting times to be seen by an NHS GIC are insane. Is it any wonder that the suicide rates in trans folk is so high when we have to be referred to a GIC by a GP, wait for an appointment to receive a diagnosis ( of which you need at least 2 appointments for which the current estimated wait time is around 5 - 7 years) then live as the gender you identify as for 2 years. All just to be officially recognised as the gender you identify with. Where as in Germany they are putting in place plans that enable you to walk in to basically a registry office, pay a fee and that it.

Its political decision. Most Torie voters are eldery (who are generally less favourable/understanding of trans people). To let the bill pass would mean that they are supporting it in a sense, which would piss off many conservative voters.
Honestly, I wish Scotland had vote for independence back in 2014. Id have been on the first megabus from London to Glasgow!

Trans women for the most part, trans men get treated like confused lesbians and are erased non-stop.
Do you mean circumcised? That‚Äôs cutting off the foreskin. Christening is a Catholic ceremony where you splash water over a baby‚Äôs head and name the baby, and it‚Äôs considered a baptism.

Edit: nice you changed your entire comment 2 can play at that game 

Double edit: nice alt lol
Get fkd
I wish the wait time was around 5-7 years. The estimates given don't take into account the increase in referrals and the steady decrease in available clinical hours and funding.

It's actually closer to *15* years.
Thats true its cruel why its like this my friend in Canada is why faster she got hers done in 3 months diagnosis and hrt and in 2 years she's getting surgrey so unfair uk needs to wake the hella upüò¢
Colorado is really great too
We got rights under equality act of 2010 so they can't dismiss us from work etc or even shared spaces to bathrooms but atm its hostile in the press on trans stuff like the bill in Scotland sunak pm is trying to go against it and they targeting us in general basically I feel fear with it atm xx
I am not elderly. 

Also have no issues with change. I honestly think we need to go about 100 miles to the left. Not just with trans right either. We should have Universal healthcare and gender affirming care should be covered without all the red tape. 

Born in the 70's, but my parents were not hippies.
I agree! it is the only language the barbaric Tories understand.
I didn't personally support indepdance, because I wasn't sure the country could survive on its own, buuuuut honestly I am beginning to change my opinion on that. Especially after Brexit. Shit's fucked these days.
I believe they're legitimately going to try to leave by next year from what I read. I could be wrong though, but I hope they leave ASAP.
It's just horrible how we're treated, it makes me so angry, I wish I could dodge paying taxes to these assholes
This exactly.  Notice none of their concerns are about trans men, they‚Äôre not even mentioned.

True, but he had one before and at least where I live lots of no voters (me included) have swapped because of the power the conservatives have over parliament
I had to go through the queue twice. This is correct .
I cannot believe that I'm actually glad to be in the US in terms of available healthcare. What fuckin' timeline is this?
Hi, 19 year old trans girl here, been waiting for 3 years, so um.. I knew the waiting list was long but.. 15 years? Seriously? You're saying I could be 30 by the time I get HRT.. even though I applied like the minute I turned 16? That's just cruel.
It‚Äôs only like this in Canada (and particularly Ontario) now, it wasn‚Äôt like this years ago.  Used to be much harder to get HRT before 2015 or so iirc when you had to get a referral to CAMH (long wait times) and they used to mandate lived experienced too.
Delaware transcare slaps and the state covers it for me since I'm low-income, but gender recognition has more hoops than the next state over, Maryland.
In the U.S, they just get fired and shot
Couldn‚Äôt agree more, this country is headed towards a revolution if it continues in the current vein.
As an European jurist :

The country will be fine : the things about Scotland having the majority of the fossils ressources of the country (UK) right now it's true.
(And there is other countries that have separated, the international law is simple on the question: ressources ARE the property of the country that have it within it's limit)
And even if an adhesion process may take time : any new money can be tight to euro in value if the country want to join EU at a later date.

That, and all the F****ING tax exemption that upper class get from Westminster and is dire to the budget of any country (I'm French, I see the exact same BS here)

So IMHO,you are better alone than with the British
It‚Äôs not going to stop someone from DIYing but it‚Äôs very disturbing to say the least
What I'm saying is you'd have place cause your given a truck and it's yours completely yours all you gotta do is drive. Look into it I'm mtf and I love driving its honestly in my opinion the best opportunity for trans men and women your your own boss they tell you where to go you drive there and get paid. They hire everyone they don't care who you are as long as you don't have any dui s your golden.
When you can drive check it out.
shinigami eyes is an extension that marks pro-trans and anti-trans people on social medias and it marks you as anti-trans for some reason

I looked through your profile and it doesn't seem that it should

The wait time in the US is 3-5 years by the time you jump through all the hoops. That, of course depends on what state you live in. Some states it‚Äôs immediate, some you can‚Äôt do it at all.

Also, take into account that we‚Äôre assuming you can afford the healthcare to begin with.
You'll probably be okay. I know Tavistock is on 2019 referrals. Lots of eggs cracked during the pandemic, so the list got way longer.
Aww so sorry hun might be best to move here to UK xx
Country *should*  be headed towards one, however the general public of the UK tend to be too entitled, bigoted, or stupid to either care or notice they are being wronged. And even when the public do notice, the majority of people will do sweet FA about it.
Sadly, I doubt it. Too many tories who don't live in reality.

Got carried a ""bleeding heart leftie"" by family the other day for implying that people striking for better wages wasn't a bad thing, she that if you wiem 40 hours a week you would be able to survive. Genuinely had my grandmother who hasn't worked since she was 20 telling me purple are being greedy for wanting living wages.

If they can't even accept ""people need wages to live on"", i do not want try dealing with the tangled Web of crap that is trans rights (or lack there of) in this country, with 'em.
Yeah I absolutely will. Thank chu! ‚ù§Ô∏è
Mine isn't marking them at all
Also depends on how you do it. I came out in January, I called set up a appointment through plume in November for December, and got approved And my subscription the same day. I took my first dose today
I was on a ""3 month"" wait-list with Planned Parenthood but got a call for an appointment within a few weeks. Did an intake appointment with some tentative plans based on assumptions about blood work. It took me about 2 weeks to get the labs done because work schedule, but about 2 weeks after that I had a prescription. Grand total of about 2.5 months after calling with no referral.

I know there's some happy coincidence there, but even without the acceleration, it's still a small fraction of 5-7 YEARS on a fast track.
Well I got hrt in 3 months wait. Name change letter in 2 weeks name changed legally by court 3 days. Ssn name change 5 hours. Now just got to do my ID and birth just they are out of state. Road trip time sex change letter x2 first was 3months second was another 4 different  dr.

The Tories were good for rich white straight people and even they don't like 'em anymore so I'm really hoping they get chucked out in the next election
I cleared it, might have only been for me, might not, idk
Aww I wish hun lol also key areas that are safe for us trans so far are  brighten Manchester blackpool (me) xx
Just need a generation or two to die off sometime soon so that the legislation stands a chance of actually reflecting the people it will effect.

Well covid, especially how tory government handled it did take care of quite a bunch of elderly actually. So might help over throw them.

"With the ""Don't Say Gay"" bill possibly passing, how do you think your life would have been different if there was education around LGBTQ+?"	"TW/RANT/DISCUSSION

&#x200B;

Ill start this off by saying I am all for education teaching students about LGBTQ people.

I didn't start transitioning until 2019/age 22. The biggest reason why? I had no idea that I could. I have had these feelings for as long as I remember. As early as 4th/5th grade. I used to look up spells & magic to find out ways to turn myself into a girl. I once wrote a note on a rock and buries it because that was one of the spells. (Newsflash, it didn't work). I even had found a website where you ""sell"" your soul to the devil in order for a wish. That didn't work either. 

For years throughout middle & high school, I crossdressed. I would wear man clothes on top to hide it. I even wore some makeup, and passed it off as being emo. But that was it. That was all I could do. There was no information or anything, that was all I was going to be. 

Fast forward to when I move out of my parents. I no longer had to hide crossdressing from them, and did it on the daily in my own place. This was right out of HS. I was in such a great place that I decided to call PP. Unfortunately they said they didn't offer trans care. At the time, I didn't realize I was trans, but that's what they told me. 

Maybe you're wondering. How could I crossdress, how could I want to be a girl so badly, but not realize I was trans? Because I had never heard of it! They never taught it. Being gay was popular at the time, so everyone knew about that, but nothing of transgenderism. 

I then googled trans people and fell into a dark rabbit hole. I saw the worse of transgenderism. I saw people who didn't pass. I saw what just looked like fully grown old men with beards, muscles, etc, in a dress. Basically, I saw what every Terf wants people to see. 

I didn't want to be that. I would rather be stuck as a man forever than to dress up as a woman and look like that. So for several more years, I kept it in. I repressed it. I hated myself and everything about the 'trans' version of me. I ended up moving back in with my parents for a bit, again, no longer crossdressing and keeping everything in. This led to very bad depression, though I didn't realize that it was because I was repressing everything, 

When I moved out of their house, 22 at the time, it all came flooding back. I had all of these urges to dress like a girl, and decorate my room like a girl, and be feminine in every way possible. Thats when I went down the rabbit hole again. This time, I found out about HRT. I found out about surgeries. I found out that I could LITERALLY turn myself into a woman. I was so surprised. I didn't know that any of it was possible. The extent of my knowledge was that I could dress up as a girl, while being a man. I had no idea I could actually BE a girl. 

Fast forward to now. I've been on HRT for 2 years. I'm 2 months post op from SRS. I have fucking boobs. BOOBS. I used to tape my chest so id have cleavage. I HAVE BOOBS. Sorry lol. 

Long story, I know, but I wanted you to understand why I feel education is important. Had there been education revolving LGBTQ, my entire life could have been different. I could have started transitioning so much sooner. Yeah, 22 isn't a bad age, but fuck 15 would have been a lot better. 

People are so against the education of it, thinking it'll create trans people, or gay people, or etc, but in reality, all it is doing is pushing these people deeper into 'the closet' only for them to have more and more issues as their life progresses. 

I almost killed myself so many times. I was a cutter, my arm is lined with them. I had terrible depression. So much more. All could have been avoided had there been someone to educate me, and tell me I'm okay. That I'm normal. 

Sorry for the long rant, but yeah. What do ya'll think?"	"When people ban discussion, it only highlights their own fear of the inadequacy of their own words.

Additionally, the bill will allow the schools to out children which will definitely result in abuse if not murder.

They‚Äôre afraid of boys being girls but are fine with dead kids.
I would‚Äôve been able to be myself as a kid. I started transitioning when I was 21. It would have been so nice to know that I wasn‚Äôt alone as a kid and that I had a valid reason for feeling what I felt. I could‚Äôve started transitioning sooner and been so much happier.
I'm about the same age as you, as when I was growing up, I was not aware that anything LGBTQ+ even remotely existed, except to know that Gay was considered a curse word. As I got older, I became aware of gays and lesbians, and 'transvestites'. The message was that gays & lesbians were crimes against nature, and against god, and trans folks were too, but even more so. When I was an older teen, the message changed again - gays, lesbians, and bi people were okay, at a distance, so long as they kept it to themselves and didn't try to 'indoctrinate' kids with it. Trans was still wrong, and I recall the argument/story that 'transvestites' were mentally ill, and that the hospitals/ facilities that performed gender affirming surgeries refused (or in some iterations it was outlawed) as it apparently made no difference and didn't 'cure' trans people.

Obviously, this is all a very negative, toxic outlook. Had there been education, I probably would have realised I was trans a lot sooner, and I would certainly hate myself less for it. But, in the eyes of my parents, and the community I grew up in, I would have been 'indoctrinated'.
I would‚Äôve known that I was trans and interested in women as a lesbian, sooner‚Ä¶
i want people to make lgbtq+ school so we are able to be ourselfs and don‚Äôt have to worry about bigots
I spent my entire childhood thinking I was asexual- actually trying to enforce my own asexuality- because it was easier than coping with my own body in context with other people.

 I didn't see a trans man that wasn't getting pregnant(which was like body horror to me at the time) in the news until my 20s- and now I still have trouble knowing what I want. Probably won't ever, because my brain finished growing while I was still confused.
Oh, completely.

If I'd had any competent education about gender and sexuality as relates to personal identity, I'd probably have figured out I'm a girl decades earlier.

And since the hypothetical existence of such an education implies that there would have been resources available to *help* me, yeah, I'd probably be living a completely different life and overall probably would have been a lot happier.

I 100% agree that a proper gender identity and sexuality curriculum would not only help, but would save, a lot of lives. On so many levels.
the entirety of my 4th through 6th grade was at a private Christian school and 7th and 8th grade i was homeschooled. during that time i hardly knew what trans meant, and of course the world around me frame all trans people as predatory men wanting to be women and girls trying to be trendy and cute by identifying as trans. but in 8th grade even tho i was still homeschooled, i got a phone and started actually learning about the world and deconstructing the illusions built by the church and my parents and the internalized phobia i had from being taught that. the more i learned about LGBTQ the more i identified with it, the more i identified as trans. i started identifying as non-binary, and went i went to a real public highschool the next year i found a few people who accepted me and later that year i came out as a trans male.

if there was any actual education about LGBTQ+ people, not only would i have realized i was trans and come out wayyyy earlier, but the world around me probably would have been way safer and way more accepting. the don't say gay bill doesn't ""protect"" kids from learning about LGBTQ, it just prolongs the discovery of their identity and/or make it *less* safe for LGBTQ kids.
When I was growing up Michelle Bachmann introduced a similar law that made it illegal for school employees to talk about anything queer, even if that meant they couldn't talk about their own family with their students, in the school district right next to mine and I grew up hearing about 11 suicides of kids like me one after another.

Even though my school implemented two LGBTQ clubs in response because they didn't want the suicide contagion spreading to our school I still knew I wasn't safe. And I knew about trans people and even had 3 trans classmates who were out and a 4th who was still closeted but taking HRT in preparation of coming out after graduation. And there was still bullying in my school and our counselors and principle were still so useless i just said fuck it and graduated early to escape, but my closeted trans friend ended up getting held back so she was alone and stuck at home even longer because of the mental toll it took on her school performance. 

Everyone could tell I was some kinda queer, especially the kid who made a beeline to my locker to call me a fag every day for 2 years, and even though I now realize I'm a gay trans man I buried that down deep and just said I was pansexual so the only queer cred I got was being the ""practice girl"" for any cis girl who wanted to sexually experiment and that fucks with me because they got to be authentically queer but I didn't, not really.
I didn't expect this to get so much traction! I'm both glad that I'm not alone in this, but also very sad that I'm not alone in this. It's such a tragedy that so many of us have had similiar situations regarding this one topic. I wish that was enough to prove to everyone else that education is needed. 

I'll respond to comments as I can. But I see you. Thank you <3
I probably (and a lot of other older trans ppl I know) wouldn't have suppressed it for so long and could've started earlier, also I might've not been gone so deep into depression. But I did get a better sense for ppl so I know who to keep at distance :)
I think a lot of things would have made more sense. I've never felt that I fit. If I'd know about trans people were a thing then that would at least have gone some way to explain a few things. There was no representation of trans people for me growing up let alone non binary people. The only time you even heard anything were slurs.  Something to be looked down on. :(
The scary thing as well is that on top of people not being educated, it will probably make it seem more socially acceptable to simply laugh and joke about LGBTQ+ people. Like it was when I was in school.

... Like a million years ago :p
God this is so important. I'm so stressed out by this bill
Nothing would have changed for me. I knew it was all real stuff (limited understanding granted). 

I just thought I was different. Coming out to myself with or without education was a struggle. But ofc this shit needs to be discussed in schools cause fuck the education system in general.
I just started transition a couple months ago in my mid 40's. The desire has been there since I was a teenager, but I didn't even know what transgender WAS until I was much older. I didn't really know what was possible with HRT until maybe a year ago. I just had no idea. Like, I thought all trans women had implants. Had no clue. 

I spent a LONG time being unhappy before I figured this shit out on my own. One of my biggest regrets in my life is all that unhappy time. My best years, wasted on depression. Seeing all the pics from 18 year olds asking if it's too late for them... All of this could have been avoided if I had even the tiniest bit of information as a kid. Of course, that's why conservatives oppose it. They'd rather see trans kids kill themselves than BE themselves.
I will never forgive my (devout LDS) parents for depriving me of knowledge that could have made my transition happen earlier. When I had my first gay (at the time I still though I was a man) experience, and expressed I might be bisexual, my mom laughed in my face and told me that wasn't a real thing. Not conflating gender and sexuality, but I knew I didn't live in a safe place to assert that I was different.

I leaned so heavily into the emo/scene kid phase, and it took years for me to realize ""oh fuck, I just liked wearing girl-cut clothes, makeup, long hair, etc.""

So many fuckin signs were there, but ""gender is an eternal characteristic of identity and purpose"" was literally framed on the wall of my house (a normal thing for Mormons, no seriously.) I am still in the process of forgiving myself for waiting so long, and I will not ever forgive them.

Education in a public setting would have potentially saved me years of suicidal identity crisis and a former pill addiction.
If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, I would've avoided a lot of hurt and trauma. Kids would be more supportive and tolerant of me and my friends. Instead, I was bullied. Majorly. One kid saw me holding hands and cuddling with my girlfriend at the time during lunch and he outed me and them to the entire grade/school. People would tell us all the time that we were weird or disgusting for being a same-sex couple. 

On top of that, I was also trans (non-binary). It was a constant battle of hearing people misgender and deadname me. If there was more LGBTQIA+ education, they would've known that gender is a social construct, and therefore there are an infinite amount of gender identities out there. It's why transgender people have an alarmingly high suicide rate because people aren't educated and they bully them.

I'm not sure if I live in the area where the bill is in the process of being passed (I hope it doesn't get passed) it's stressing me the fuck out. All of my trans friends or just any lgbtqia+ friends please stay safe out there, and I'm proud of all of you <3
I had education about it and I‚Äôd wish that on everyone. It wasn‚Äôt perfect. To me it always felt more like gay/trans people exist and you should respect them then maybe you are gay/trans too. I though asexuality was a hypothetical orientation and definately only associated bisexuality with celebrities. Also I remember being 11 and discussing with my classmates if someone could be both trans and gay or if that would cancel each other out. But I got the general gist of it that queer people exist and just let them be, which is a great start (also the idea that teachers hide the gayness of ancient greece feels so weird to me. My teacher was very vocal about his problems with the fact that the movie Troy made Patroklos Achilles‚Äô cousin)
You literally explained my entire situation perfectly everything besides the moving out part was literally me word for word. I had wanted to be a girl since elementary school and used to secretly cross dress when people weren't around and whenever I'd say or mention anything slightly feminine people would react strangely so I shoved it down and hated it for years but no matter what I did it wouldn't go away. Then I sort of learned what trans was but yeah I saw the guys dressed like girls and I was like ew no, or I saw girls with guy parts, and that's all I thought it was forever. I'm 19 so I haven't moved out yet, but recently I decided to finally figure out that part of me instead of shove it down and try to get rid of it. Did some research and was had the same reaction as you pretty much, I was like damnnnn I can fr be a girl wtf, no way and now I'm starting hrt in 2 weeks and I couldn't be more excited or happy about it
I wish they would have talked about it when I was in school. Then maybe I would have realized all the feelings and thoughts I had were normal. I‚Äôm 35 now and just realizing I‚Äôm trans. ü•∫ü•∫
God fucking dammit i needed to hear this so bad 
Ive canceled so many first appointments because ‚Äúi can never be a woman‚Äù. At least not like those other tf girls who always look absolutely stunning . Today i shaved my face (and most of my body- its a forest now x.x) for the first time in months. I i put on a feminine outfit that had been sitting in its amazon packaging for like two months, unsure if itd even fit me. 


Looking in the mirror i started crying because i saw exactly who i needed to be to finally achieve true peace. Since that moment id bounce the hrt thing back and forth, terrified of getting stuck in some inescapable trans purgatory id fabricated from ideas of people who would never know what its like to be me. So much fear‚Ä¶ and for what? 


Then i read your post‚Ä¶. Im shaking and crying as i write this but because of you and this post , along with every other absolutely beautiful person in this sub who has been brave enough to share their journey, im doing it.


IM SCHEDULING MY FIRST VISIT FOR HRT RIGHT NOW!!! 


Thank you, OP, for fighting these so called false norms and loudly realizing what i feel so many of us need to. Some of us (like myself) just cant help but be stubborn with ourselves. Posts like yours have so much power to change that ‚ù§Ô∏è 


Also thank you to my wonderfully supportive girlfriend who i cant wait to join me on this journey herself :,)
I hope she sees this too :) im gonna go give her a big hug as soon as i catch my breath.


And thank you so much to everyone else sharing their stories as well as their progress. If they ban discussion we‚Äôll fucking start our own. You can‚Äôt silence those on the path to self enlightenment and happiness. Especially when you shout from the towers of fear, loathing and misery! The governments with anti-trans agendas will make it harder , they always do, but when have they ever effectively stopped shit. I mean the war on drugs seems to have certainly worked okay üôÑ 


(Im sorry for the potentially nonsensical rant. Im so used to apathy and lack of emotion, that im having trouble even thinking clearly now ffs)


Tldr: OP, im starting my HRT journey id put off for so many years thanks to your post. I know it wasnt the main topic but god damn you struck a nerve in me T.T
Thank you again ‚ù§Ô∏è


I love you all so gosh darn much. ‚ù§Ô∏è

Im tired of being a woman pretending to be a man because society decided thats where i fit. And im tired of seeing my ‚Äúcondition‚Äù as anything but a facade being forced upon me by soulless masked faces. No more, this girl is ready to be happy :,)

Im ready for this mask to be gone once and for all , and fuckin hell ill be loud about it - bills or no bills.
This, only 40.

Growing up in the 80's, I never knew just what could be done until I stumbled onto it here a few years ago.
This was a great sharing story. Thank you!  I had similar experiences as you, but I didn‚Äôt find out about these things until my late 20s, and even then, I repressed my feelings and felt trapped in my life path. YouTube trans vloggers really helped me. The internet was nascent when I was 15 and my parents technophobic tendencies kept me from a lot of resources as well. Education would be amazing. But unfortunately there‚Äôs a lot of education to do for the people making education decisions, and they‚Äôre way less open to ideas and change.
Are-..are you me?

I had such a similar experience of just ‚ÄúI didn‚Äôt know this was an option!‚Äù. Growing up in the south as well we didn‚Äôt really have this kind of visibility in the first place. And the first time I learned about it I didn‚Äôt have enough information to really process and accept it and had that same experience of googling and subsequently thinking ‚ÄúI wouldn‚Äôt be able to pass so I think I‚Äôd be even more miserable‚Äù. Like. I didn‚Äôt see hope at the end of that tunnel. Then after repressing it‚Äôs for a few more years and being depressed, learning more about it, and actually having available information this has been the greatest choice of my life.

Also turns out my family was suspecting it since I was 3. Still lil salty they didn‚Äôt let me in on the secret sooner lol
Thanks for sharing! I relate so hard. I'm 27 and just starting and was oblivious to the trans option until a few years ago. I grew up in Poland, completely sheltered from gay people or people of colour etc. - any mention of trans people was maybe an occasional joke on the tv.

Only after moving to UK in my teens and spending a lot of time online have I slowly cured that toxic conditioning.

I wish trans education was more common both now and then. I'd know sooner, and maybe wouldn't be so worried about my family to come out.

Knowing what ace is would most certainly have helped a lot. 

Knowing I am a Transfem Enby would have spared me easily 10 years of depression, possibly more.
[Section 28](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Section_28). I lived with it. 

To avoid any accusations of ""promoting homosexuality"", there was no mention of sexuality or gender at all.

It didn't stop people realising they were other than cis-het later in life but did lead to some confused, closeted, often self loathing people. These days, at least there's the internet.
Free speech, until it comes to what they don't want to hear. I fucking hate these bills.
Well, I didn't know being anything other than straight was a thing until I was 13. After I'd had my first kiss with a ""same sex"" person. And I only knew that being trans was a thing until I was 21 (I'm 29 now, haven't started transitioning yet and don't know when that'll be because I come from a toxic, conservative family that has fucked me up in more ways than one). And then when I was 23 I was like ""okay, think I'm not cis, I may be enby and uh okay so maybe I'm not straight..."" because it was just easier (and I was afraid, please don't come for me saying this is bad rep for the community, everyone's lives are different). And I only came to the fantastic conclusion that I wasn't enby when I was 25, and it's been a nightmare since then. Because again, toxic family, if I come out in any way, I'll be ostracised and I have CPTSD (from the toxic family) and am not neurotypical so that wouldn't be good. I'm just trying to survive, I guess. But in what ways? Well, I think I'd have been miserable much earlier. I'm sorry this isn't an inpirational tale of earlier self-discovery. I showed signs of being masc since early childhood but I simply didn't know.
Without this Reddit page and educational websites my many misconceptions about being trans would‚Äôve taken many more years to be corrected, would‚Äôve been miserable. And as for my sexuality, I‚Äôm currently grappling with my being aroace and I can guarantee it would be a lot easier with more education and representation. I‚Äôm kind of relying on Jughead and Todd Chavez here
Maybe. I‚Äôm just now getting some understanding in my late 20s. 

I certainly didn‚Äôt have a full understanding in my teens. But I had the internet. I did quite a bit of reading on wikipedia and google. The information online even in the late ‚Äò00s was nowhere near as good as it is now. I knew that surgeries were a thing. I knew that LGBT people existed. I knew a few people in the gay-straight alliance in high school, and I knew about gay people from TV. Hell, I even knew that I probably wasn‚Äôt 100% straight. But for me, changing gender was something that mostly existed in the sci-fi novels I read. I didn‚Äôt ever think transition was something available to me. I didn‚Äôt know that trans communities existed, I didn‚Äôt know any out trans people IRL.

In college, I did meet and befriend some gay people and trans people. I encountered egg memes, and I was a little afraid about how much I related to them. I listened to podcasts with stories of trans experiences (shout-out to This American Life, Snap Judgment, and Risk!). I thought I might be agender, *maybe* genderfluid, but I still never considered transition as a possibility. A lot of the trans stories I heard were deeply tied with suffering, trauma, depression, etc. But my experience was more numbness, and bottling-up my feelings. 

It wasn‚Äôt until a couple years later that I started to encounter more stories similar to my feelings. And maybe more importantly, stories of trans joy. Combined with that, I finally was out of school, I had a somewhat stable career, a place to live, and I felt like I had space to work on myself. To try and become more honest, vulnerable, and in-touch with my own feelings. It was a combination of listening, reading, maturity, and life circumstances that eventually led to the egg cracking.

So for me, it‚Äôs hard to say how much my life would have been changed if I had more education about LGBTQ+ stuff in school. I wish I might have been more comfortable experimenting with gender presentation, but I was already so obsessed with blending-in and looking ‚Äúnormal‚Äù that I probably wouldn‚Äôt have changed. But even if education didn‚Äôt speed up my self-discovery I think I would have been more understanding of the LGBTQ+ people around me.

And anyways, I don‚Äôt feel any huge amount of regret for starting ‚Äúlate‚Äù (as if your 20s is a late time to start *anything* in life). I mean, more than the physical aspects I just wish I had figured out a lot of the emotional stuff way earlier. But I guess I was protecting myself emotionally from an environment that didn‚Äôt seem entirely safe. 

TLDR: I really don‚Äôt know if better education would have helped me transition sooner. But either way, it probably would have helped me be a better person.
Pretty clearly unconstitutional and federally illegal.

Not only does it violate the 1st amendment; it also violates the civil rights act; of which LGBTQ people are covered under as per a SCOTUS decision.

Really... the concerning part is the intention might be to get this into the SCOTUS, to reverse that decision.
I didn't even know HRT was a thing until I was *25*

Needless to say, my life would have been very different if LGBT education had been a thing
God this is exactly like me. Not knowing what being trans is, finding out and seeing only non passing trans women, freaking out, repressing, finding out about HRT and finally transitioning. If only I knew sooner.
In the UK we had Section 28 which banned anything that could be construed as ""promotion of homosexuality"". It was repealed half way through my schooling but the damage was done. Didn't primary school thinking I was pathetic for not liking the same things the other boys did, then in secondary school hid my gender identity so much I ended up burning out and becoming a shell of a person. I don't know if what I like doing now is purely for the love of it or if it's cover. LGBT kids in my school were relentlessly bullied and little if anything was done about it. Things have changed, there are more of my schoolmates who are living their true lives now, but I do think we would be much more tolerant without it.
I knew I was trans at 15 or 16.. the signs started when I was in like 6th grade.

I was told that I wasn't because I wasn't straight afterwards. Knowing I'd never get the hormones needed to pass I tried my best to play the part and be a guy. I never fit in. I never felt ok. I missed all the time people spending learning who they are, and constructes a facade.Now a little over a decade later I'm transitioning.

I wouldn't have a kid. But I would have my hair. My voice. My face. I wouldn't have spent so much of my life feeling lost worthless and hating myself and my body.. I probably wouldn't have picked up self harm. I'm facing years of expensive and painful surgeries just to have a _chance_ at who I wanted to be. Who I **should** have been.
Well I knew I was trans in 1973, but I was at Tanner 2 in 1971, so yeah if education and blockers had been available *especially for the adults* I would have lived a very different life.
Seconding what you are saying. I could have known myself so much better had I just been allowed to know the truth. I grew up in a very liberal area that was relatively LGBTQ + friendly. But I never really understood that I didn‚Äôt have to be a boy if I didn‚Äôt want to because no one told me I could. Education is so important and so many aspects of life, Socio political issues, racism, the queer community. The more we learn the more we can understand, and the more we understand the more loving and tolerant we can be
Your little life story in the description is (unfortunately) very relatable. I was referring to myself as ""a boy in a girl's body"" as early as elementary school. I knew nothing about trans people other than transphobic depictions on tv, so I thought there was no way I could be that. I wasn't like those depictions. I was a real person. I was given no indication that transness was a real-people thing, and I even less knew what the hell it actually *is*. I basically thought it was crossdressing because that's essentially what those depictions showed it as. Men who refused to get out of their dresses. Something to laugh at.

On a similar-but-different hand, gay people (as tv told me) were only men, men who loved other men in a shallow way, with voices that made every word sound like it was written in pink glitter pen. Any same-gender attraction of any other sort was not anything I ever saw. And asexuality? Forget about it.

I found out I was bi when I was about 13. I found the word during a random internet scroll and didn't know what it meant. I read the definition and immediately knew it was me.

Finding out my transness was a bit trickier. Once I found out it was, in fact, a real thing, I was... 15, I believe? I clicked with it but all the transphobia I internalized over the years made me hesitant to declare myself a man. I wouldn't be decently comfortable doing so for another two years. And I'm still doubting myself after all this time.

My point is... if I were taught these words, and their real, unfiltered, non-stereotyped definitions... I probably would've had my whole identity figured out by age 8. No struggle. Minimal uncertainty. Schools can and should give this education. No one should have to deal with this confusion.
We live in a messed up world.
When I was a child, I had no knowledge of what transgender was (born in the early 80's). So to answer the question, I likely wouldn't have felt shame over cross dressing and I wouldn't have kept it a secret (immediate family is accepting). I could have gotten therapy to help me understand what I was feeling (didn't know what transgender was until I was 15 or 16). I wouldn't have felt the need to keep everything bottled up inside until I was in my late 30's and I would have been able to lead a happier and far more productive life.
If, when I was a child, I had people in my life who told me that trans people exist and that it‚Äôs okay to be trans, I feel like I would have come out much sooner. This bill is bad for so many reasons, and forcing that message out of schools is going to result in long term heartache for LGBTQ+ youth
Maybe I wouldn't be the disaster of a human being am I today.
I‚Äôm 28 and just started HRT, about a month and a week into it now. Your words, especially about just not knowing trans was a ‚Äúthing‚Äù down to the terf propaganda and suicidal ideation was my experience exactly. 

What saved me was an amazing and loving partner who helped me find the information and resources, and now three months after coming out I am happier than I have ever been in my entire life, and I haven‚Äôt had a suicidal ideation SINCE I came out. 

I absolutely agree that there needs to be public education on this. My conservative grandparents threatened me countless times for acting gay or feminine and it took me until 28 to have a safe place and be myself.

Nobody should have to wait to be themselves. Cis people don‚Äôt.
I would‚Äôve learned how to genuinely love myself rather than just acting like I did. I would‚Äôve learned that it‚Äôs not normal to hate everything about your body the way I did. I wouldn‚Äôt have grown up hating myself and feeling dissociated from myself. I would‚Äôve been able to be me, unapologetically, and sometimes I grieve the life I could‚Äôve lived had I known about being trans sooner.
Gods I wish there was discussion about being transgender and being transgender wasn't stigmatized. I probably would have immediately identified with it if I was shown materials as a child.

If you asked me if I wanted to wear a dress and be a beautiful girl when I was 3 I would have said yes 1000 times. I wouldn't have spent 30 years of my life depressed that I couldn't dress the way I saw other girls dressing. I wouldn't have not had any friends because I could never relate to anyone.

My life would have been so much better. I don't understand why society wants to impose misery onto LGBTQ+ people. It's just so lame.
I grew up in the 90s with very little exposure to LGBTQ information, nor a support environment, and that definitely had an impact on me not hatching as a trans person until I was 44.

Education, visibility, and acceptance are vital.
If there was I could have definitely avoided the past 2 years of trying to piece my brain back together, I still kind of am but not so much that its driving me mad anymore
I grew up in a pretty conservative area.  I barely knew that being trans was a healthy thing you could be vs some sort of mental illness to be ashamed of until I was in college and I didn't speak to a trans person (that I was aware of) until  I was an adult.  If I knew that it was something you could explore I probably would've transitioned sooner than my earlier 30s.
You would think this bill came directly out of the Kremlin
Someone in my class said today ""that's it ladies, gentlemen, transgender men, transgenders and the the other parts of the lgbtiqa+ community"". 

Pretty sure it was supposed to be a joke but I didn't know you're no longer a man if you're gay, I thought that was a thing
I grew up in a small town where LGBTQ topics weren‚Äôt really talked about, outside of church that is, even in the early 2000s things weren‚Äôt good. It wasn‚Äôt until I started working in healthcare that I got proper sex education and a view of the world outside my bubble. I learned there are people who exist just fine outside my own ideas of what ‚Äúnormal‚Äù was. My favorite patients were the ones who made me go ‚Äúhuh, I didn‚Äôt know that was a thing that could happen‚Äù and challenged my narrow view of the world. I remember walking home from school one day and seeing a pride flag, I sorta knew what it was but just thought ‚ÄúI‚Äôm not sure how I should feel about that‚Äù, because that‚Äôs what I was taught.

This bill doesn‚Äôt JUST negate LGBTQ education, it enables homophobic/transphobic dogma, and not everyone is able to leave that bubble until after it‚Äôs cemented.
All I can say is thank God for the internet. Banning discussion of LGBTQ issues will do nothing and will only create negative feelings and bad blood. 

Also, people who ban things are never the good guys in history.
Oh if I had learnt anything about trans people as a kid I probably would have transitioned before puberty. My childhood was basically full time disassociation from dysphoria (which I didn't even realise I had), which lead to bullying, which lead to more disassociation. I remember thinking several times in 4th/5th grade ""I wish I was a girl."" One of my few strong memories dispite all the brain fog.

In any case, I'm 22 now too! Still pre everything but would love to start HRT this year. Congrats on your progress, I'll have to catch up!
I wouldn‚Äôt have wasted half of my life, failed relationships, and lived in absolute depression and misery until finding myself.  I would have been a smarter, more productive worker, and my work ethic is considerable to begin with.  My faith in God probably would have been preserved.
I don't have much to add here - I just want to say thank you for writing this out. I'm 28 and my experience wasn't all that different from yours, although I only just started HRT this year.

A lot of what you wrote about just hits home. I just wanted to stop by and say thanks and that I hope everything is going great for you! Cheers girl üíú
I don't know if my life would've been great or anything, but certainly a lot better.

I often wonder how my transition would've turned out if I could've transitioned at 16 instead of 30. Would I pass? Would I have more feminine features? Would I have lived a more fulfilling life? Would I be happy?

There are so many what-ifs that I'll never have answers for. And it makes me sad... Sometimes I don't know what to do, except move forward with my life today.

It fricking sucks knowing I can't have that time back. I feel robbed of my life. And it sucks. I hate it.

But I'm glad that things are changing, that people will have the choice I didn't get. That gives me hope. At least future generations will have the ability to decide for themselves if they're trans. I'm glad about that.
I'm honestly fearful for all of my American trans sisters and brothers. Still not perfect but in the UK being trans is a protected characteristic under hate crime laws along with sexual orientations and ethnicity or subculture.

Even so I wish there had been at least some education about lgbt+ when I was in school.
If there had been I'd not have suffered and tried to take my own life so many times before finally being clued up not just on lgbt but exactly what it means to be transgender and that I'm not a monster nor ""broken""
I‚Äôm against the idea of teaching a kid this or even introducing this same as bible in school I feel as a parent you need to educate those situations. I love the gay community and have no issue with my kid asking questions or even being gay. What I don‚Äôt like is a group and I mean any group telling someone what they should feel or think and this goes across all fields.
The ""Don't Day Gay"" bill reminds me of an action in 1992 NYC on a very similar matter, where a provocative activist group, the Lesbian Avengers, handed out balloons that had ""Ask About Lesbian Lives"" printed on them.    

A four minute video from the [action](https://youtu.be/dzIbGdP7MDQ)
If I had been taught that shit in middle school I would have 1) transitioned earlier and 2) feel so much less gross since I wouldnt have discovered being trans was a thing by stumbling across porn
I think things would‚Äôve been really different for me. I probably would‚Äôve started pursuing transition in high school or college. I didn‚Äôt realize transitioning was a real thing. My only exposure to trans people was transphobic jokes in film and tv, and my family making fun of Chaz Bono. And a little later we started entering the cringe and anti-SJW era or the Internet, which I now realize was mostly just making fun of trans, gay, neurodivergent, furry, etc. folk. If I had seen celebrities who were trans or text books with photos of average trans people, and if I had known about the possibilities then I probably would‚Äôve realized that my feelings were actionable. 

Same thing with sexual/romantic stuff. Maybe I would‚Äôve gone out with those cute possibly bi boys who I now realize were repeatedly flirting with me in high school. Even as someone who has an explicitly homosexual person in their family, gayness seemed like a different universe at the time. Prior to adulthood, there were only a handful of people I‚Äôd ever met who were out of the closet, and they were both the stereotypical gay man and lesbian, and simultaneously social pariahs. So like, if I saw the wide variety of ways gay folk can be then maybe I and the undoubtedly many other queers in my high school would‚Äôve felt empowered to be ourselves. 

Even beyond gay stuff, I might‚Äôve been more sexually open if I had been told that sex other than PiV sex is cool. Like, if I had been told I didn‚Äôt need to penetrate my partner just because I have a dick then maybe I would‚Äôve been more amenable to the idea of having sex. 

There‚Äôs a lot of ways that people could benefit from even just a little more education. I know I could have, and I‚Äôm positive that I‚Äôm not the only one.
In the UK LGBTQ+ stuff wasn't able to be taught in schools until section 28 law was repelled in 2004 when I was 14. So I had no education on queer people, and I wasn't good at the internet I did come out to myself when I was 19 but put myself back in the closet when I found out how hostile people here are..... Then I came out properly in 2019....when hostilities towards trans people is far worse. 

I am lucky that I have a fairly feminine face but I still get started at a lot...
whats the context on said bill? i havent heard of it yet (i am european)
I never hid who I was. I got beaten and spit on for it, but I never hid the fact that I was transgender. I think that having an education including trans awareness would have at least made me feel less like an alien. I just never thought that I fit in at all.
Yeah I didn't figure it out til I was like 27 cause I just didn't know the options. Would've saved myself a lot of misery if I'd been informed earlier.
Hey I passed my style off as emo too back then, yet I am transitioning now days. Thought I was the only one who did that hehe.
I was raised Jehovah Witness and learned early to not talk about ""those feelings"". I barely knew how to put those feelings together except that I thought good would kill me because of them. I wish I had proper education and maybe I could have started transitioning earlier in life.
If I had actually been taught (properly) about LGBTQ+ it‚Äôs not an exaggeration to say that my life would have been drastically improved. I probably would have realized I was trans way earlier. I also could have cleared up my confusion with my sexuality sooner. 

I literally think about it all the time how if someone in an educational/therapy setting asked me the ‚Äúbutton question‚Äù at a younger age my egg would have immediately cracked. Just like we screen kids for all aspects of their life, physical, mental well being etc, there should be a ‚Äúscreening‚Äù for gender dysphoria. I had all the signs but didn‚Äôt put it together because I had to discover it on my own.
Sorry that I haven‚Äôt been paying attention but what bill?
honestly would have been amazing for me and a lot of my old class mates, would have created a more accepting enviroment, and i would have started questioning my identity sooner, that is assuming the best ofc, it would have helped me a lot
Well, I was actually taught about trans people in middle school. At age 14. We saw some documentary about it. But it took me a further 3 years to realise that I was trans, after I got in the same class as my now best friend who‚Äôs also trans. I had a lot of signs of being trans but I never pieced it together before meeting someone else who was and hearing about their experiences
I've struggled with mental health since I was about 6 years old, pretty much when I realized people were forcing me to be a girl and the entirety of society had their back. I was defiant about dresses, the color pink, marriage, etc. I came to resent femininity as a whole and became toxic to my lady friends who began to explore overtly feminine presentations. I was around enough good people to cut that shit out, but the wound remained.

Only at 30 years old did I realize that nonbinary was an identity. I spent more than two decades filled with resentment and pain that could have been entirely avoided if that was presented as an option. I probably would have been more comfortable with people different than me (feminine people). 

I was always confused because I never wanted to remove body parts, and that's the story of trans people I was sold. ""Being trans is when your body doesn't match your brain,"" said my trans male best friend. I fully believed him in the name of solidarity, but that narrative kept me stuck in no man's land for longer than necessary.

The growth of the trans conversation during COVID has saved me from a lot of hate. It needs to happen. Queer people will keep existing, whether we acknowledge it or not, and the sooner we accept that reality, the healthier society will be.
I would be sitting around. Depressed, wondering what was wrong with me. 

Did the bill get passed?
they're passing a bill that makes it illegal to talk about LGBT people? pardon my ignorance as I'm out of touch with politics (for good reason), but if that's really it then that's fucking hilarious.

the party of ""free speech"" finally mobilizing and limiting free speech when they don't like it. how long do you think it'd take until the ""I'm standing up for our oppressed rights!"" crowd finally starts building labor camps and throwing minorities into them under the guise of ""degeneracy"" or ""protecting the country"" or whatever nonsense?

my god it really is like Lord of the Flies out here.
the only reason my school has ever brought Lgbt in a positive light, was the fact they were legally required to.
I'm really happy for you. My story has a lot of parallels and I totally agree with you. Had there been better LGBT, emphasis on the T education when I was younger it would have saved me decades of misery.

I hope we can get it right for the kids that are just starting now so they don't have to go through all of that.
I‚Äôm wishing for a positive teaching of people who are different to accept them or shall I say us gays crossdressing and transgender all of us our bodies are for us not others to tell us how we should be
I'm just getting started at age 23 and didn't start properly asking the questions I needed to until I was freaking 20 for the same reason. I pretended I was a girl online for a couple years before this and never made the connection. I just had no idea trans people existed. First I ever heard of it was Jenner and... I have a lot of negative feelings about her that I'll set aside right now, but- yeah my exposure was limited. What's worse is I grew up in a southern conservative town. Boys were gay (which in that town was a bad thing, they felt) if they wore a pink shirt even once. The only reason I even thought to try was because my friends in college put me in a dress and it just... clicked that something was so, so right about it.

Had there been education, I'd have been able to start teaching myself how to pursue my transition even sooner. Mom still wouldn't have approved and I'd have still had to escape that damn town, but I'd have probably started at least a couple years sooner.

Education is essential.
Lots different.
I can't say whether I would have realized I was trans significantly sooner, but there at least would have been *a chance*. Maybe knowing that there were *options* would have led me to idly question just out of ""curiosity"", and maybe I would have realized ""Wait, that...sounds kind of nice, actually?""
I would just have figured out that I liked men, women, and enbys way earlier than I did. Never really cared about who I was attracted to, I just got attracted to people. As for my gender, I probably wouldn't have lost the one person I've dated that I aftually loved because of misinformation, and I would have figured out my gender like, 2 years earlier .
Such a disgusting fascist bill
As I'm still somewhat new to the LGBTQ+ scene I had no idea what is/ has happening/happened in LGBT politics. Had no interest in it, regular politics much less. So I did some looking up on this and holy hell. I'm horrified by the thought processes of some of the more prominent Republicans.

That being said: I would have been able to start exploring this part of me much, much, MUCH earlier in my life. I had known being transgender was a thing only after Kaitlyn Jenner was the big name in media. At that point I still didn't understand what it was. Until recent years it was still so alien to me. Until transgender rights advocating was really being shown in media, I didn't understand the jealousy I held for the girls in my school growing up, my sisters, and other women I had in my life.

I've had multiple thoughts of attempting suicide growing up because being dead was better than hating myself, seeing a stranger in the mirror. But as the years went on and I felt more and more ashamed of who I was. I forgot about it. I forced myself to play a role. So much that I ended up repressing my identity crisis and essentially forgot about my feelings. I still had the dreams though.

Last year my egg cracked, I don't know what caused it, how it happened, but I started remembering all of these repressed feelings.

I wish I had known sooner.

But...
If I had, I wouldn't have the greatest love in my life, my son. I wouldn't have the friends I do now. I wouldn't have the most supportive and loving partner I've ever had the joy to love. And if transitioning much earlier in my life meant losing what I hold dearest in my heart now,  no thanks.
I thought the bill was going to be killed like the last time? I haven't heard of it getting any traction in The house or Senate outside if the same small group that supported it the last time?
I didn't knowingly meet a trans person until I was 28 when a girl at my work came out. My egg cracked 3 months later, meeting Zoey saved my life, it snapped me out of that disassociative fugue state I had lived in until then. If I had known earlier I wouldn't have missed my life up until now.
Gonna throw my story on the same pile of ""(a few months before) 22 wasn't a bad age, but 15 would have been a lot better"", because that's basically what my story was too.
Well since I live in the UK where it wasn't discussed but everyone accepted that queer people exist no I don't think education on LGBTQ+ topics would've helped me what would've helped me is instead of being forced to learn pythagoris theorem which I never did learn because it confused me and because my country's response to neurodivergent kids is to stick them in a special school where they learn primary school level maths in their 3rd year of high school learning about my country's history would've been much more worthwhile since I'd actually remember that but no instead we were taught about the evils of the British Empire abroad and absolutely nothing about the evils of the British Empire committed against it's own people and yes of course the evils of the British Empire abroad is important to learn about I never learned about how the English soldiers butchered Scottish civilians based on nothing more than a suspicion that they were a rebel which guess what a lot of the time the English soldiers did suspect a peasant farmer to be a rebel so what they'd do is burn down the peasant's farm leaving them destitute if they were lucky if they were unlucky they'd be killed or arrested and tortured the English's hatred of the Scots was unleashed on full display during the Jacobite Rebellions
I feel like there is still a distinct lack of education around the LGBTQIA+ community. I was doing research around the trans community and only JUST discovered that being born with another genders brain ISN'T just a metaphor, and is actually how the brain develops. I feel if we had this education ready in classroom environments there would be more acceptance around this beautiful community and less drama about small niches in the wider community.
I would've known I was trans
Had this been a thing that was taught at young ages, I would have been able to start doing stuff about it back in 2nd grade when I first started experiencing these feelings. 

I think it‚Äôs a great idea to teach about it before there are the effects of puberty that make transitioning so difficult at later ages. And any part of the process that happens when you‚Äôre a kid is completely reversible, so the ones who mistakenly think themselves to be trans can just stop at any time and just continue on like nothing happened. This would help many LGBTQIA+ people and would not cause any negative effects for anyone who is cishet.
Very disappointing to hear about this. I have not heard of this ""Don't Say Gay"" bill until now. Like you, I would have known I was trans much earlier if I was simply educated on the subject. I would have been transitioning for at least a decade by now if there was proper education on being LGBTQIA+. Your story brought up a repressed memory of mine. Despite going through a journey of skepticism at the same time, I also found a website full of spells and attempted to use them to change my sex. You would email them and ask them to preform a spell for you, and I begged them to please turn me female, even if only for a day. I guess in a way I got my wish, just a little later and with far more time and energy üòÖ
I was told in middle school, public education early 2000s, that you cannot change your gender or like people of the same sex or gender.
The school shunned and frowned upon individuality.
I lost many friends from self harm and suicide due to such a negative stigma around it.

I feel if LGBTQIA+ topics were discussed and supported in schools I wouldn't have had to mourn the loss of so many of my friends.
I probably wouldn't have waited till I was in my 30s to transition out of fear of being murdered, beaten or disowned by my family.
Still to this day my childhood upbringing effects me with internalized issues that will take years of therapy to overcome.

The people I work with and clients that I interact with don't treat me with nearly the respect that I believe I would recieve if they were raised with a level of acceptance and understanding of LGBT+ issues.

I wish for a better future for all kids in this country. It's the future they deserve yet some butt hurt politicians would rather see LGBT folk dead or suffering physical and emotional trauma than create a healthier nation for everyone.
I probably would have known I was a man earlier. Growing up I never quite thought about my gender very much, part from being annoyed at how different I was treated from the boys just because they said I was a girl. I knew of trans people but the few stories I heard didn't match my own experience and so it didn't occur to me that I was trans. 

I've lived a pretty turbulent life, bouncing around from work to work around every 3 to 6 months for most of my young adult life and never really had the time or energy to reflect on my gender and identity. It wasn't until I was almost 30 that my life settled more down and I had interactions with people that forced me to take a hard look at myself. And I fought against it because of various reasons. It wasn't until I by pure chance joined a few non binary groups on Facebook that I found people with similar experiences. It changed my world. 

I'm now 32, turning 33 this year. I've legally changed my name, working on the papers to change my gender and have an appointment with the gender clinic in May to hopefully start T this year. I wish I had known earlier. Cause thinking back I have suffered from dysphoria all my life, I just didn't know it. And it's also probably the reason for my lifelong depression. 

I'm also asexual. I thought I was broken. Again I knew about asexuals but the only info I could find was that ace people are repulsed by sex. And I don't fit in there either. There really needs to be better education on lgbt matters cause that can help someone like me not feel broken and damaged
Same ‚Äî most of my life was spent saying everyone calls me a boy, so I must be a boy? Guess I‚Äôll just suck it up and make the best of things. I simply didn‚Äôt know that I had any other options. 

I don‚Äôt think my sex ed was particularly anti-LGBT (I grew up in CA in the 90s) but I don‚Äôt particularly remember trans people being a topic. I‚Äôm not sure if learning more would have helped any ‚Äî I suspect figuring it out in high school would have been too much for me ‚Äî but I wish I had learned more about the topic at an earlier age. Maybe I would have spent more of my life actually living.
I tried to kill myself at least a dozen times before I was 16. I'm from Omaha and the extent of knowledge I had growing up about transitioning was 1.That I was probably going to be stuck as a boy forever. And 2.That if I somehow magically transitioned, I'd end up a gross punchline of a sick joke about a ""chick with a dick"" or ""dude dressed like a lady"". The only reason I began to understand why I'd always known I was in the wrong body, crossdressed, stuffed my shirts, tried on my mom's clothes, etc, is because I figured out how to clear the internet search history and would continuously google ""I want to be a girl"" when no one was home. I remember reading articles about a young Kim Petras and thinking, ""yeah, I'm just like her. I'm not broken and I'm not a monster"" just the sheer knowledge that other trans people existed was enough to quell my most self destructive thoughts. Education matters, and kids are confused as hell sometimes due to plain old lack of education on these subjects. All this legislation that lawmakers are trying to push is just so disheartening and I feel that in the majority public eye, us trans folk are still in the ""it's just a decision"" phase, implying that we are all just cis people actively choosing to be trans. UGGHHHHH. The world pisses me off.
I'm so happy that you ended up being able to be yourself and not have to worry that you aren't 'normal' or whatever. But it pisses me off that people just don't educate their kids or students about this kind of stuff, and even (like with this bill) ban the topics from being discussed altogether. I was so scared and confused when I was younger because I had always known I was a boy, but my family was Christian, I live in the South, and it was hard to find help. Luckily I had some great friends who educated me and helped me be who I am today. 

This bill absolutely disgusts me and makes me want to puke. Especially with so many people supporting it. (TW) Do they realize that this bill will probably end up causing a lot of LGBGTQ+ kids to commit suicide because they felt like you and me did - alone, scared, confused, and hurting?
I had no idea that nonbinary people existed for most of my life. I knew for most of my childhood that I ""wasn't like most boys"" but I also didn't feel like a girl so I had no idea where I fit in. It probably doesn't help that my first exposure to trans people was through pornography, so you can imagine what my perception of the trans experience was. I could never see myself like that, so even as I got older and learned more about trans people I still didn't think that could be me. I had a period of time where I described myself as ""90% man"" and I wonder if things would be better now if I had known what nonbinary means back then.

I also had no idea people could actually be asexual. I just thought I was ""more mature"" than my peers because I didn't get distracted by sexual attraction, when it was really that I didn't even feel sexual attraction. I even had someone in high school call me asexual once, although it was from a position of ignorance as they compared me to an amoeba, and it took a long time for me to separate that experience from the concept of asexuality because I had to educate myself.

As a nonbinary educator, this bill would almost certainly mean the death of my involvement with the public school system. I'm just so nervous that the mere act of asking students to use they/them pronouns for me could lead to conflict with some parents. I have a few contacts at the school district so I can talk to them about options, but I don't want a misguided bill to ruin such an important part of my life.
One thing first off, can you elaborate on the 'don't say gay' bill you mentioned and on how/where it's possibly passing? I'm not familar at all- üôÉ

I agree wholeheartedly though. If I had trans-positive information about trans people from a young age and it was just common knowlege, I would've gotten to start actually *living* already. I was an egg for such a long time;

\- I 'pretended' to be a girl on omegle all the time for no consious reason, though I probably rationalized that 'oh most people don't even talk to men on this site so I have to say F if I wanna talk to anyone' even though most people I ended up talking to were horny and talking to people there wasn't always the most plesant thing.- every D&D character I've ever played as has been a woman- I tended to play female characters in games- My friends were categorizing our group into Naruto Akatsuki members in HS and I got Kisame because I like water powers a lot, but I hated 'being' him (I rationalized it that I don't like his character), and I asked them if I could be Konan instead, even though they already assigned another one of us to be her because she's a girl.- I then proceded to COSPLAY Konan for Haloween that year- I joined an RP discord server and my character was a girl, and they assumed I was a girl bc I apparently type like a girl, and that made me happy. I invited some IRL friends to the server too, and told them to not tell them my name or that I was a guy (because I wasn't, little did she know- haha).- I straight up had thoughts for a couple months in like freshman/sophmore year of HS that were straight up 'man my life would be so much better if I was a girl' and 'geez it would be so awesome if I could be a girl' and 'wow I wish I could be a girl that'd be so great'. And those thoughts only faded away when my emotional plate filled up more and I had less space to think about it.

The exposure I had to trans people was t-slurs in anime, and my friend dated someone one time who came out as transmasc and he told us about it (but I never connected the dots). Besides casual transphobia and awful exposure that I'm sure I was exposed to but have no memory of, that's it, that's all I can remember.

Then when a content creator I liked a lot (Eskay) came out as trans, I was like 'yo thats awesome!! I'm happy for her!' and then the next several months was a very very slow and gradule ""wait-""

I don't have much memory of my childhood, but had I been exposed to trans-positive info and been educated about trans people as they are and not the shitty stuff like t-slurs in anime and stuff, I probably could have come out much sooner. Not that I know for sure, but possibly even when I was in the single digits.

That would have changed my life. I won't go into it, but I feel Existential Dysphoria really fucking hard. Shit sucks :(

*(*[*the idea of Existential Dysphoria is explained here by the Gender Dysphoria Bible*](https://genderdysphoria.fyi/en/existential-dysphoria) *(amazing resource go read doesn't matter if you're trans or not))*
As I am a knowledge whore, I would have loved to learn about this far earlier. Knowledge shouldn't be shunned because some people disagree or don't like it.

I didn't really take good care of myself, or care in school, I half assed everything (except my personal interests). I even dropped out like 3 months before graduating highschool cause I couldn't be bothered, and I was completely apathetic towards basically everything and everyone. In the last ~6 months, after coming out as nonbinary, and then realizing I'm a trans woman, I've taken so much better care of myself, mentally, physically (maybe I'm still a little lazy), emotionally, hygienically, etc. I feel better as a person, and I started actually caring about life in general. I can't imagine how much that could have changed me to realize earlier on, idk if all of these are directly linked, but thinking about the doors I closed because I didn't care and was generally unhappy is saddening. And if I came out as trans earlier maybe I my life would be completely different.

Learning about LGBT+ is literally life changing for some people.
I completely agree. Finding out certain things are options only open the door for those who are already inclined to do so. Finding out writing with you left hand doesn't magically turn right-handed people into lefties. At most, they'd try it once and realize it isn't a good fit. Same goes for gender and sexuality. There might be a handful who try the new option briefly, and realize it doesn't fit them. For sexuality, that might mean a date/one night stand/or just imagining what it would be like. For gender, it might be a new haircut, new clothes, or at the very worst (and lowest percentage) medical transitioning before realizing it was a mistake. But that, along with forcing yourself to use you left hand when you are right-handed (or vice versa), comes down to some other factors, just as the small percentage of detransitioners are still mostly trans people forced to detransition due to social factors (left-handed people forcing themselves to write with their right hand to avoid punishment/ostrization/etc.). But even then, the vast majority won't even try out 'writing with their left hand', because they know that isn't who they are. 

For me, I didn't know trans men existed until my mid-twenties. I had heard all the awful, transphobic rhetoric about trans women growing up in a fundamental christian religion/conservative area. And I believed it. I never understood why anyone, let alone someone born with the body type/anatomy I always wanted, would want to be a woman. I had convinced myself that most women were basically resigned to their fates, because that's how I felt in my body. But then I found out trans guys existed. Suddenly, I didn't have to be resigned anymore. I could get the deeper voice I always wanted. I could gain the same muscle as cis guys working out as much as I was. I could grow facial hair. I could have a flat chest, or even a penis, the smell of a guy, the internal body heat of a guy, and so, so much more stuff. Stuff I always wanted, always saw that I SHOULD have, that my brain expected to have. And once I saw it that way, I could easily see how trans woman would want the same but reversed. The same way I finally understood that women, cis or trans, were just as comfortable in their bodies as guys are in theirs. It just wasn't the right fit for me. I finally got to write with my left hand (metaphorically, in this case). 

If I had known earlier, I still likely wouldn't have been able to transition much earlier. The house I grew up in...it never would have happened as a minor. And the only way I left was by joining the military, which also isn't the best environment. Still, knowing earlier would have improved a lot of mental health issues for me, just knowing transitioning was a future possibility. We can't go back and change our past. The only thing we can do is make the present and future better for those who come after us. This bill would do the opposite of that, and deserves every bit of opposition and criticism it gets. More, to be honest. I always thought it was pretty ironic that the 'right' are rarely ever on the 'right side of history', either in the present or when looking back on the past.
Cool so more people might have the possibility of ending up dead or in the hospital several times from people tryin to kill them. Happened to me. All happened in high school. Went thru 6 before I found one where I was just a nobody rather than being tormented, punched, stabbed, drag by my book bag from a running vehicle...having my arm broken and my jaw dislocated and called every name in the book.
And never had one teacher on my side. Was it cus they were scared or were they just as fucked up as the kids I went to school with ..guess I'll never know LOL
100%. they should be held liable when bad things happen. I wouldnt doubt we see a rise in suicide. Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports. 

Though we all know, theyll blame those suicides on being LGBTQ rather than their own ignorance pushing people off the ledge.
>but are fine with dead kids

they love dead trans kids! what are you talking about?

less people to be disgusted with is obviously what they want.
100% where I'm at rn. I really feel like I got cheated out of the last 20 years. I really wish I could go back and relive them as a woman, or even as a trans woman with the knowledge I have now. :/
Hard same. My trans education was watching Ace Ventura at 9 years old, and it shoved me into the closet for 26 more years. I‚Äôd give almost anything to get that time back.

I wonder every day what my life would have been like if I‚Äôd had access to the resources trans kids have today. Taking them away is ignorant, irresponsible and cruel. Those kids will still be trans, they just won‚Äôt realize why everything in their life seems lifeless and empty.

It‚Äôs child abuse, pure and simple.
Sounds like a good idea until you realize Gathering a strongly hated population into a small building is a recipe for hate crimes and arson etc. tis a shite world we live in
Haven't multiple countries tried this before with black people and white people?
I ran for a few years in being asexual too. Eventually realized it's because I just wan unable to come to terms with using the equipment I was born with. Why would I want to have sex with these bits? I don't even want these bits. 

Now I feel like I'm stuck with a sexual awakening while transitioning. Just doing everything 10 years too late.
Something that helps me is to remember that just because my brain is done *growing*, it never stops *changing*. I have PTSD and that hope is what keeps me going. I'm a better person than I was last year or 5 years ago even though I'm a full-ass adult.
omg im crying! Im glad my post has helped you so much! i wish you the best in your journey :)
Same here +10 years... *sigh*
Exactly!
How is a bill like this on it‚Äôs way to getting passed in present day?
I agree with your general sentiment but I think the logic starts forming cracks when you get into the details. 

When we put queer kids into context, they exist whether we teach them about themselves or not. 1 in 6 children in the US are facing child abuse regardless of identity. That number gets bigger with queer kids.

So, more than 16% of school kids have unsupportive families right out the gate. More than 16% literally do not have guardians that will teach them much of anything. So society *does* have a major role in the education of themselves & their identity. Society has neglected that role, and that's one of many reasons why queer kids have hard lives.

In other contexts, that can apply to black kids who feel out of place & not understanding why, or even positive things like encouraging the trades or STEM or teaching empathy and social conduct. Kids need society to fill in for the failures of their families, regardless of how we feel about interest groups. 

I know you support the gay community as a concept and I think you were alluding to keeping religion's values out of the classroom (which I completely agree with). But I've seen this kind of logic used against the queer community as well, so I think it's important to look at that.
lmao its insane how many of us have gone through a lot of the same stuff!
A bill that would ban education/talks regarding LGBTQ stuff in school
Passed the house, i believe
it passed in the house, if im not mistaken
wtf that‚Äôs a total breach of privacy letting them check KIDS genitals. wtf is wrong with this country.
>Especially with the other bill that wants to check students genitals before allowing them to play sports.

What the actual hell.
it‚Äôs already bad enough going to the doctor for the yearly check up shit and having them look at your dick you never wanted
Correction- They love dead trans kids, they don't care if the kid is cis.
Feels!
Ah but you see the cruelty is the point. Conservatives need someone to oppress in order to feel good about themselves. Now they're even going after the Furry community.
i did not think about that. maybe school officers and stuff? we have those in normal schools here anyways
Because we live in a world of immoral sadists who only act on impulse
Well said.
The right wingers are the real pedophile cabal and are just projecting it on LGBTQ/leftists/etc... via conspiracy theories to shift the blame from themselves.
TLDR: a lot
Yeah we don't want to start on the rabbit hole that is ""what's wrong with the United States"" unless you have actual days to burn. It'd be far easier to list what *isn't* wrong than what is.
I will say that when I first heard about this I thought they meant like literally having them drop their pants in front of some gym coach and was terrified, but I'm at least thankful it's not that (of course this is still a trash idea tho). Last I heard, they just want a doctor's confirmation or a letter or smth that the kid is indeed a girl/boy and that they're not being ""brainwashed"" or smth by their parents or on hrt üôÑ
I remember learning this, god it still makes me wanna puke
There is no way this will pass Constitutional muster.
yeah my bad
Sadly schools with police on site have higher rates of incarceration and police brutality for black and POC kids for infractions that white kids get detention for and the queer community isn't exempt from racist attitudes that fuel the school to prison pipelines.

We shouldn't have to all be the same to get respect and honestly it'd just set kids up for failure once they leave school and their hit with all the homophobia from people who liked us better when we segregated far away from them.
Just make it a secret gay school we will send invitations to all the gays via pigeon
Unfortunately they're inefficient as it is. It'd probably be worse
I mean they‚Äôre standard in every school, but that‚Äôs not gonna stop a legion of inbred dudes from states you‚Äôve never heard of from converging on the school and overwhelming the 3 police officers. It would be impractical in our current society, lgbt clubs should be a standard practice tho
true tho
I'm trying to think, fuel prices maybe. Though that is slowly cooking the planet so maybe that's wrong too? But yeah, most of the essential things in the US are a bit a dumpster fire.
yay i love the gay pigeons!

Leaving Iowa forever was one of the best decisions I've ever made. I don't know that I would have survived transitioning there. I gave up a comfortable life at a dream job to be safe and happy. I'd do it again every time.
wonder how bad it has to get before cis people finally wake the fuck up.

Same as the late 80's they were up in arms about gays then because of the children. Gay DOES NOT EQUAL Pedophile and NEITHER DOES TRANS!!!

Wish hell would be real just so they'd rot in it.
They say ""Think of the children"" as they taught theirs to hate trans kids and trans adults.
We live under capitalism, do you think anything is done for the people? No, it's for the money. As long as we'll live under capitalism, most things will be done just for money, that's what capitalism is in a nutshell.
Whenever a conservative (or right winger in general) throws around ‚Äúwhat about the children‚Äù rhetoric regarding LGBT+ people - take a look at the political leaders in states with lower ages of consent, states that still allow child marriage, states with child beauty pageants, states with higher rates of child SA and production of abuse material (and which political blocks are overrepresented in such crimes). You can also look at homeschooling, where that's most popular and with what political blocks and how common CSA is in those instances. Then think about how the right wing conveniently ignores the actual facts of all of these issues and instead invoke intuitive bigotry against trans people. Also the fact they still support people like Matt Gaetz. Then you'll see the truth of the matter. 

It was never about the children. It's about two things only: invoking genocidal rhetoric against minority groups they want to get rid of (as has historically happened against queer people, Jewish people, the Irish if you go far back enough etc) and to dilute the issue of child abuse so they can continue their own predation in the shadows. All the stats and information on child abuse shows its the right wing that do it the most, and they also argue for policies that would much these things WORSE (the reduction of sex ed, lowering age of consent, higher burden of proof for victims in court). 

The right wing is just pro-abuse. That's really the only conclusion to draw. They like when children are hurt if they're the ones doing it. The cries about saving children is just theater to deceive people into fighting innocent trans people to take eyes away from pastors, parents and politicians who are overwhelmingly the real predators. They love CSA and will play defense for it any chance they get. Why? Because they're evil. That's where it all leads. There's no other explanation than they love things that are bad and hate things that are good.
I‚Äôm also from Iowa and the first name after I came out was Catherine before I changed it again so I guess you‚Äôre just the alternate timeline me.

It protects businesses from liability if a student is injured or killed due to company negligence OR student negligence‚Ä¶

It does require the student to be enrolled in a special ‚Äúeducational‚Äù or ‚Äúwork-based learning‚Äù programs and does have stricter safety regulations than normal for those jobs (supposedly, we‚Äôll see how that‚Äôs enforced), but reading into this I am worried.

yeah...
""I like money""
""Think of the children"" they say as they complain about teachers teaching children about the world.
They Legitimately think beating their kids for being trans will make them ‚Äúchange their mind‚Äù and therefor it‚Äôs actually helpful.
... as they beat their child for disobeying their commands.
‚ÄúThink of the children‚Äù they say, being the political block most likely to sexually abuse their own children by a huge margin.

Money buys a lot of votes, and the mob that benefits from child labor and doesn't care about civil rights has a lot of money.
It's on the sub because they are also passing laws in iowa that would out trans kids, and forbid teachers from ""affirming a child's gender identity"" if that identity does not align with the one assigned at birth
under capitalism, everything is done for the people. I can even name all of those people in under 10 minutes (‚Å†¬†Õ°‚Å†¬∞‚Å†¬†Õú‚Å† ñ‚Å†¬†Õ°‚Å†¬∞‚Å†)
ah no, I'm not even in the US xD
in the outside world, we all have to follow whatever happens in the empire as we all depend on it, unfortunately...
of course they would. they're capitalists. they already did that before, that's why child labor laws had to be fought for in the first place.
They already have, there are places where children were found working in car factories dangerously and illegally. Conservatives defended it saying ‚Äúwell the alternative is that child wouldn't be getting a wage! It's better for the children to be working and earning their share than just going to school. It's valuable experience!‚Äù 

Again, this is in a situation where children are being put at risk of severe injury and death, untrained. They really want this.
which is chiefly why I bring these memes here. we need to bring up counterarguments and points against genocidal rhetoric thrown at us as much and as eloquently as possible in the public discourse...
The hypocrisy of them arguing that anti-trans legislation is about the protection of children.
well, you're in for a rude awakening. worse things have happened just in amerikkka alone, just over the last 100 years. being ""western"", whatever that's supposed to mean, can't stop a society from developing a cruel, oppressive, genocidal system... our only hope is grassroots solidarity and good organization.
the one that caught my eye is a ""don't say trans"" bill
I've read it with Mr.Krabs' voice.
It did make me suppress my desire to transition for 30 years.
Either there on drugs or insane
Beating me for being trans made me mask which is far more damaging than the immediate trauma . . . Also the lasting dmaage from trauma not great either. I know I'm not the only one and that these people keep . . . it's evil and cruel and so vile and the justifications are hollow and full of hate.

I can understand them working at a fast food restaurant or something. That‚Äôs a decent income for a kid who wants to save up for something they want but  working in a car factory is complete bullshit
I think conservatives media is both of those things
I think that it's that strange phenomena that happens to people in the 1984 book where their brains are so messed up that their minds only do the logical stuff when necessary and then go right back to the weird propaganda bs that doesn't make sense once logic is no longer required. 2+2=4 when you're building a house, but when it comes to stuff you've been conditioned to believe otherwise, 2+2=Whatever the party tells you it does.
Stay out of trans subreddits, you just spent hours arguing in favor of taking healthcare away from kids, how abhorrent of you to try and invade here.
oh, and isn't it convenient how they spend all their time free from genocidal rhetoric talking about how much they don't like public schools? they absolutely will dismantle public education if left unchecked. they need a poorly educated labor force, one that doesn't even think about questioning their power as an economic class.

ATTENTION: All my brothers, sisters, and Enby friends. Oklahoma is trying to pass bill SB 129 that would ban trans healthcare until age 26!!!		"As a born and raised Oklahoman this makes me incredibly sad to see. Please if you live in the state call up or write to your representatives and tell them that we DO NOT need a cruel and senseless bill like this!!!
I‚Äôm 16 and in Oklahoma. I‚Äôve been on T a year. Got top surgery 3 weeks ago. The idea of having to stop my hormones for TEN YEARS sickens me.
Isn't age of medical consent 18 in the US federally? How is that legal?
Another reason for me to hate this stupid state I live in. Everyone always points to Texas or Florida for shit like this, but Oklahoma is, and has always been, a conservative hellhole. I'm just... So tired of everything...
Im australian and i just read this bill i hope that you americans protest the living hell out of this bill. Like this can NOT EVER BE ALLOWED TO PASS. LIKE EVER. 


FUCK TRANSPHOBES AND FUCK THE PPL WHO WROTE THIS BILL.



Im so sorry my Oklahoma brothers and sisters and everyone in between
South Carolina is trying to pass a bill that ends informed consent for adults üôÉ
Not only Ban it, but also forcibly medically detransition anyone who has already started hormones before the age of 26
If they have such an issue with gender care, drugs, and even surgeries then there are a lot of non-trans things that need to be included as well. They are basically discriminating against trans people. Aren't there anti-discrimination laws in this country?
Ew, fucking burn that bill. When will someone usurp these despicable pricks writing this abhorrent shit?
I'm not an American but i can feel how it makes you feel, my government also tries to ban trans people to have surgeries
TWENTY-SIX!?!

This is so fucking unhinged, how can they even pretend this is about PrOtEcTiNg ChIlDrEn when they are pulling the numbers directly from their ass?

Are they trying to say Oklahomans can't drink or vote or join the military or get married until 26 either?

They're making it kind of obvious that if they got this one they'd immediately move the goalposts again
It‚Äôs horrible. We are fighting a similar ban in Arkansas. that effects trans youth to age 18. Missouri has just introduced the same bill as Oklahoma that would ban to age 26 or is otherwise a felony. Yesterday, Kansas introduced a bill declaring it a felony to age 26, and Kentucky to age 18. Yes, do all you can to block passage. Once it becomes law, your only recourse is a lawsuit. Moving the age to 26 shows this was never about children. It‚Äôs about control, discrimination, and erasure. This forces families and individuals to have to flee their state to receive healthcare, legally. Also college age students to have to attend out-of-state. Countering this, Massachusetts, Connecticut, California and Washington DC have passed laws to protect as places of safety and sanctuary to protect you. Thank God for the ACLU. They are using great resources to fight the states that are banning this live saving care. I urge your support for their efforts. Follow Chase Strangio, ACLU trans rights attorney and trans man on IG to keep-up. He‚Äôs on the frontline of this fight. A true hero and champion for trans rights!
Is it just me or did every state randomly decide today would be the day to fuck us all over? Within the last 10 minutes I've heard of 3 states that are banning trans heathcare.
What the fuck???
there's no way a bill like this could possibly be passed. absolutely fuck them for trying
They want us dead.
I feel the walls slowly closing in as I fall further away from sanity . I am horrified by what‚Äôs happening and I feel powerless to help and or stop it . I hate this country .
Are you fucking kidding me. I‚Äôm in Oklahoma and I‚Äôm 21, and desperately trying to get a job to get on HRT, I hate people.
Remember: a lot these super radical bills aren't ment to pass, or at least Republicans know they are unlikely to, but these bills are primarily meant as a threat. Think of it as sneak peak of what's to come if they ever gain enough power over the government
Those Oklahoma conservatives are just...so typical. The age of sexual consent in that state is 16 years old, and they have never expressed a problem with federal law permitting military service as young as 17 years old with parental permission. You can vote at the age of 18 for local, state, and national leadership. You can drink at 21.   


So, you can be trusted according to the law for all of these things, but Oklahoma just absolutely feels you cannot be trusted with your own gender identity until the age of 26; and health care professionals who attempt to offer gender-affirming care to anyone under that age face felony charges with sentences equivalent to murder.

Yep. Republicans. Making sense since never.
I live in this state and my wife and I are older transfolk who have recently decided to transition and this scares me to my core. Its not right. If this goes through it will only lay the ground for even terrible stuff. I am honestly not sure what to do. Other than moving.
I was raised in South Carolina, now I live in Georgia. My mom won't let me live anywhere I want.
Oklahoma: the new and worse Ohio
Why do people think this is okay? More trans people are going to end their lives if they cant medically transition (if they want that) or have proper healthcare. Is that what they want? Us to die? Because we never will be wiped out completely.
I‚Äôm so sorry to my trans siblings in Oklahoma, I can‚Äôt imagine how you guys are feeling right now. I‚Äôm in Montana and fighting a similar bill that would detransition people under 18, but 26 is absolutely ridiculous and blatant discrimination. I‚Äôm lucky that I‚Äôm only in Montana for the holidays and I get to return to a relatively safe state in Wisconsin in a few weeks. 

I hope to god this bill and others like it don‚Äôt pass, and I‚Äôm wishing everyone (except the transphobes who propose/want bills like these) safety and all the best things <3
Oklahoma here. This makes me incredibly sad and scare. I have faith it will not pass. I am 29 but the thought of anyone being forced to wait until 26 is INSANE
Oklahoman here, I‚Äôm sorry‚Ä¶WHAT?
26 is outrageous. It's unfair. How can one be considered an adult who can drink and drive but not transition. - Annabelle Skywalker. context: she came out to the council. 

In all honesty if they wanted to do this route pick a more sensible age like 18-21 any of those your or any in between ü§£ I'd be willing to make a compromise, it would suck, but 26 is really unfair. 

I'm gonna transition and then move somewhere remote and snowy.
No no no
So much for being considered an adult at 18
They better be okay with a huge segment of their population moving out of state the moment they turn 18 (which I'm sure would do wonders for a state with Oklahoma's problems).

To be honest my home state is exactly the sort that would pull this shit too. So that's fun.
I seriously hope we can get to a point in society where it is simply unacceptable to even mention the possibility of passing such a bill, imagine if someone proposed to pass a bill that directly goes against any other minority.. why is it acceptable to do this to this minority??
Also reminder that it is still illegal for minors to receive blockers or hormones in Texas and all the anger about it just disappeared a couple weeks after it passed. I would‚Äôve transitioned already if it wasn‚Äôt for Greg Abbott.
If passed, a lawsuit would need to be made against it as it is in direct violation of the 14th amendment and is discriminatory to a single group of people. Not to mention it goes against the broad consensus of the medical and scientific communities.
That‚Äôs horable
is there literally anything i can do for y‚Äôall as an out of state person?
The fuck
ugh. i hate this state, and im already likely being forced off T in February due to no under 18 thing. shit man.
Most of America will try to pull this trash, so we gotta either deafen them with our voices, or straight up leave the country
Can we take over that place, if we help the ace‚Äôs with Denmark they could help us take Oklahoma over
[deleted]
Does any one know mass laws for transness
That's absolutely horrendous anyone voting to pass that bill should be ashamed of themselves.
Just kill me instead plsüôè
Oh fuck off Oklahoma >.>
How did they even come up with such a bullshit. Just thinking about this makes my head hurt.

&#x200B;

*Living in Czechia doesn't sound that bad after all...*
26? that has to be a typo.
Good I hope the pass this shit out of this. You don't Oklahoma, move to California
 (22 years old ftm Oklahoman) Great! üò§now I‚Äôm going to end up homeless In the middle of Denver do to being legally blind and only getting ssi.
I‚Äôm a born and raised Oklahoman too. I‚Äôll call and write, but I‚Äôm also gonna make a plan to get outta here. I hate it, but I‚Äôve lost faith in our state‚Äôs politicians
Can people outside of the USA write to the Oklahoman representatives?
Also, Kansas and Kentucky filed anti-trans bills just yesterday. Kansas filed one banning gender affirmation healthcare up to age 21. The one in Kentucky is like the one being challenged by the ACLU and plaintiffs in Arkansas (age 18).
I'm 34 and been on and off T for a while, currently off. If there's an interruption in your hormones, there will be effects but they can be tolerable. I can tell you how it is for me if you're interested. But I wanna point out: having already had top surgery makes a HUGE difference in how well I'm coping with being off hormones. When I feel down about getting my period back, I just hold my chest and think ""these are never coming back"".
top surgery at 16??
How did you get T and top surgery at 16 in oklahoma especially
[deleted]
States also can't ban drugs that are FDA approved but thats a SCOTUS ruling so I'm sure the game is to keep getting sued until they make it to the supreme court and override precedent and ban HRT along with birth control and medication abortions.
Oklahoma legislature doesn't really care about legality. In fact they hope it makes it to the supreme court most of the time so the shitty fucks can make it illegal everywhere and take away the few good things we have in this shit stain of a country. 

If people don't fight back? The next 20 years is going to get bad. And i dont meant ""contact your representative uwu"" fight, i mean legit in the streets fight. 

I strongly recommend any LGBTQ+ person start building IRL community and defenses. Which isn't easy, i know that, but we gotta try.
Well idk how it's legal but my friend said the reason it's 26 is because until 25 u can stay on ur parents insurance (not all the time ofc) and so they want to force u to wait until u can't use ur parents insurance
Not ‚Äúalways has been.‚Äù Tulsa used to be the little blue spot in that ocean of red. Sadly, those days appear over.
NO LITERALLY THO I HATE IT BUT UNFORTUNATELY I‚ÄôM CLOSETED AF AND IN NO POSITION TO ARGUE AGAINST AN ANTI TRANS BILL BECAUSE OF MY TOWN/HOME AND I HATE IT
[removed]
Yes but Texas takes the cake.
I haven't heard this and can't find info on it, could you link me to news about this?
Only when it comes to employment and things like that. And even those aren‚Äôt as solid as they should be
What country?
It was never about protecting children it‚Äôs about getting rid of trans people. That‚Äôs why it is set to 16. That‚Äôs when insurance from parents cut out. 

Edit: 26 not 16
Shroedinger‚Äôs Adult: Always simultaneously old enough to serve as cannon fodder in wars and be forced to accept maximum criminal liability and enjoy some adult privileges like gun ownership and voting (for now) but also simultaneously still too young to have control over one‚Äôs sexual and reproductive lives and gender identity. üôÑü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏èü§™
New year, the culture war is starting up again. Lot of these places were focusing on abortion and now that they won that, it's time to focus on the rainbow starting with the low hanging fruit that is trans rights. We've already seen them start working being gay back into the narrative.
That‚Äôs by design tho do something crazy outrageous to numb the more ‚Äúreasonable‚Äù law they will try to push next for age 21. I‚Äôm sure their end goal is no HRT at all for transgender people. It‚Äôs also fear tactics and bullying to control and get transgender people out of ‚Äútheir‚Äù state or make us conform to their psycho views on life by hiding or staying in the closet. 

Sadly I live with one of those psychos that spew propaganda news 24/7 around here and think it‚Äôs the only one telling the truth and is no need to watch any other perspectives. Thankfully for only 4 more months!
If it makes you feel any better, it's basically all just an illusion. A big scary shadow meant to install fear and keep us from expressing ourselves. There is a very real threat don't get me wrong, but it is not the big scary monster they want us to belive it is.

This heavy push that tranphobes are trying to do, is more akin to a weak and wounded animal lashing back in a desperate attempt to stay alive. In other words, it's just a group of politicians who see society changing, and are desperately trying to maintain the status quo. As long as we don't back down, and understand the threat they can still pose, we can win.
Testing the waters
Georgia‚Äôs not too bad, it‚Äôs quite purple at a legislative level (though obviously it can still be rough to live in the more rural parts of a state.)
As someone who has lived in both Oklahoma and Ohio, I still prefer Oklahoma but both are hell holes.
That‚Äôs exactly what they want‚Ä¶
That's what they are hoping for...
Also, I‚Äôm pretty uneducated when it comes to politics and things of this sort. What can I do to help with this sort of thing?
26 is when you can legally no longer use your parents‚Äô insurance. they‚Äôre trying to make sure no one can do that anymore (which funnily enough is exactly how i was able to afford top surgery last year).
same, Im going to the snowy depths of colorado. I live in texas and its currently a shithole here.
I'm pretty sure that's exactly what they want to happen. Force everyone out of the state who would vote against them.
?   The state was told they couldn‚Äôt investigate families because of that.  And Abbott‚Äôs order doesn‚Äôt carry any force of law.  Are doctors really refusing to provide gender affirming care now?!
Republicans want us dead and gone. Simple as that, first it was 16, then it was 18, 21 and now 26. Dysphoria and ostracization kills, they know this. They're not going to stop until they can forcibly de-transition every trans person in the US. It has never been about protecting the kids or young people. That's just how they indoctrinate people who are on the fence.

>HOWEVER‚Ä¶ & we all need to be fair, listen, start a conversation, take the message and remove your feelings from what you may hear/read! Just hear me out.

Republicans do not argue in good faith about this issue, they've already made up their minds because we go against their precious book. There's thousands upon thousands of medical evidence, documentation, studies, what ever you can think of that support the existence of trans people, trans kids and how transitioning can be a medical necessity. THEY DON'T CARE.
I wish it was man
I know it‚Äôs sad isn‚Äôt it? I know I could never live there again and I don‚Äôt even feel safe visiting friends and family down there.
Yes, you can.
I know that most effects are here to stay and that mostly it‚Äôll just be fat redistribution (T didn‚Äôt stop my period. I‚Äôm on pills for that.) I‚Äôm sad my voice won‚Äôt get to continue deepening though and that my facial hair growth may not come. it just makes me sad that this is what my state has come to, thank you for the advice and assurance.
Age of consent is 16 in Oklahoma üëç
Yes! Some real lucky kids whose parents consent and go through all the work can  get top surgery at 16. Or at least as of right now
A lot of the time with minors top surgery is only approved (for people who have been consistently presenting for years) to prevent more invasive surgeries in the future if you lose access to HRT, like say your shitty government proposes legislation that would force you to detransition and your breast tissue starts growing again.
Good parents.
I think the train of thought is the whole ""you're not fully mentally developed until age 25"" but that's kinda bullshit too. We operate dangerous machinery at 16, are forced to enlist in the draft at 18, can ingest literal toxins at 21, etc.
That's the age you get kicked off your parents insurance. So they are banking on the knowledge the younger generation wont have any healthcare.
Not American, but a big supporter of the 2nd amendment. Every trans person that can trust themselves (physically and mentally) with a gun should get one. The bigger and more lethal the better.

It's a fear tactic that also doesn't work. The very fact that bills like this have even been introduced and suggested, is because we have a voice now! And the only reason we have a voice now is because we exist within the collective unconscious. People know we exist, and as such we have a voice. But unfortunately for the transphobes trying to get rid of us, they are three steps behind. In order to get rid of us like they want, they would need to erase our existence, the knowledge of our existence, and any thing we used our voices to say. Which is impossible to do. The only thing bills like this do is make us miserable and angry. 

And history has a lot of examples of what miserable and angry people do to the people responsible. (It doesn't end well for those responsible)
My point.
Vote for people who don‚Äôt support this (if not already voting).  Support local and state candidates who support people‚Äôs freedom to be themselves
Don't go to the springs. I live in the springs and it isn't the best, especially since focus on the family is here, and they are pretty much a hate group. Go to Denver or Boulder.
Let them rot in their hell hole then! If they want their conservative dystopia so bad, then I say we take all the people who want out, out. Then shut and lock the door, throw away the key, and let them suffer under the rules they wanted.
Wait really? I heard that there was a teenager taken from their parents because of it and assumed that Greg Abbott got what he wanted. We weren‚Äôt outright refused but she said no doctors ever called her back
It really is. I was hoping to start transitioning in OKC, figured it'd be safest there, but now that might not even be an option. But I'm gonna try to keep my head up and hold out hope that this bill won't pass.
No, the train of thought is ""these people are disgusting and subhuman and I want less of them on the streets,"" and that brain development horseshit is just the window dressing to make it seem rational to centrists and liberal moderates.

Oh yes for sure all this is doing is progressing LGBTQI  rights in the long run. If they just never said anything or never put any focus on our community they could of kept laws and rights in the Stone Age for a longer time like they would have liked. 

Sadly this causes psychos to murder and harm us at a higher rate or atleast it‚Äôs more publicly covered now but just like they have done in the past it fails in the long run. 

All they know how to do is run the same tactics over and over and keep failing.
I agree, but there are trans people who are going to be stuck and can't leave. As much as I'd like to leave Oklahoma I don't really have the resources to.

Yeah keep your head up girl and let‚Äôs hope things get better from here
I can promise you it won‚Äôt, but it really doesn‚Äôt matter. The more outrageous the bills get the more they pass more ‚Äútame‚Äù bills like banning hrt until 18. It will just keep going until bills like this get passed.
Tulsa is a good area too atleast so far for myself :)
We do not let children - 

Drive, Marry, Enter a sexual relationship, Drink alcohol, own guns, make medical decisions, live alone, get tattoos, and so so so much more.

Why in the hell should children be able to start gender reassignment on there own?  Now 26 years old is a bit much but someone in their early teens.... hell no.
As long as we don't get complacent and continue to fight back, none of their strategies will work. We only loose if we don't stand up for ourselves.
Thank you :)
Hey! A fellow T-Town girl! I wonder how many of us there are.

Edit: oh snap! My spouse and I are trying to sell our condo and do RV life!
Its medical treatment under the supervision of adults. Those decisions don't get made entirely on the kids whim. Honestly, I think blocking trans healthcare is a form of child abuse. Most early trans care is preventative anyway. In my country, you can start HRT at 16 with parental consent, which makes perfect sense to me. Past 18 it should be nobody's fucking business.
Exactly. The LGBTQI+ commentary has been doing it for a long time already and it‚Äôs not going to change anytime in my lifetime only get stronger :)
Who knows! I have not met another women that is trans in this area before. I been myself for a few years now running. Around 101st and memorial. Have been mostly peaceful minus stares and one rude comment in the past.

Small world! That is the dream for me and my spouse to travel and RV full time but sadly stuff has slowed us down. We are hoping to get a RV in about a year if all works out. :)
[removed]
Okay dude

Edit: do you actually want me to explain why or are you just gonna default to calling me a pedo or something
[removed]
Okay, so.

Nobody is fully medically transitioning minors, to start. Most trans affirming care for minors is preventative or social. Basically, if a kid expresses some tendencies that seem to indicate they're trans, their parents would set them up with a psychologist. Then, in collaboration with their doctor, they'd set up a treatment plan.

At this point, theres several adults involved, including 2 qualified professionals. The kid has final say in terms of refusing care, but receiving it is done in tandem with legal guardians and caregivers. This is extremely normal, we do pretty much the exact same with other medical treatments for minors (surgery, vaccines, etc).

As for why, going through the wrong puberty as a trans kid is extremely traumatic. In many cases, trans affirming care is life saving. Not to mention the additional stress that can be prevented later in life by facilitating a smoother transition.

So now you have a kid, maybe 13 let's say, who's on puberty blockers. Literally nothing about them will change. If they realize they're not trans, they just have to stop taking them and there will be no long term issues. Blockers have been used in this way for non-trans affirming care for a really long time. After several years there is a slightly raised risk of bone problems, which is why some countries opt to allow HRT at 16.

Whoa? 16? Okay, calm down. At this point the kid will likely have been on blockers for 8 years, fully socially transitioned, and not shown any indication that they're incorrect in their assessment of their transness. Again, this decision would be made in tandem with professionals. In addition, HRT works differently if someone hasn't already gone through puberty. They really slowly ramp it up, which would allow for plenty of opportunity for someone to realize they're wrong.

Cis people often spread fears of irreversible damage brought on by HRT. But to us, first puberty is exactly like that. It's literal body horror. And if you think that a minor couldn't possibly understand their gender identity, especially with the help of multiple professionals, then you're just flat out wrong.
[removed]
Blockers just stop puberty from starting, thats not a life altering decision. Thats a totally normal age to prescribe that, the point is to prevent the onset of puberty which can start anywhere from 8-12 depending on the person.

Again, we'll prescribe blockers at this age if its to affirm the gender assigned at birth or prevent complications from a puberty that arrives too early. You just get scared because its trans healthcare. You can say 8 years old as many times as you want to make it sound all scary lmao. Im literally just saying that--in tandem with medical professionals--a child and their legal guardians may elect to take something that will prevent the onset of puberty until either the kid realizes they're actually not trans, or enough time has elapsed that you can reasonably start further transition care. Im not putting kids in an industrial-sized meat grinder here, Im trying to save a lot of trans children a lot of unnecessary trauma.

If you never had any human interaction for the rest of your life, would you still transition?	"I (MtF) was talking with a friend and we got on to the subject of my transition (of course). They are very supportive, but also really curious. Based on some of the questions they were asking, I could tell they're understanding of what transition is (for me, at least) was not complete. Like most people I've encountered so far, they always think about the impacts of my transition on other people, like trans women in women's sports, or bathroom bills or terfs believing we're destroying women's spaces.

I explained to my friend that for me, even if I never had another conversation with anyone else, never had another single human interaction for the rest of my life, I would still transition. I would still pay hundreds of dollars per painful session to get facial hair blasted off my face, I would still take my hormones, and I would still undergo painful and expensive surgeries. I am transitioning so my physical body finally matches that mental picture I have of myself. That dissonance exists in me regardless of whether other humans exist or not.

Anyone else agree?"	"I'd transition *sooner*
Hell I think that would make it way easier. If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, almost all my fears and doubts about medical transition would go away. Sure I might still have to deal with the occasional impostor syndrome but my other apprehensions have a lot to do with social interactions.
If I never had to interact with another person, I would be all in, boy mode gone, living as me. While it is important for those I love to see me as me, it is even more important for me to be able to see me as me.
I think a big element of the transgender experience is the social aspect, the element of being socially seen as who we are on the inside. That said, I'd still have started my transition if I wasn't going to socialize at all.
Ya I‚Äôd still have to look in a mirror, no?
I haven't had any meaningful human interaction in going on 7 years, and there's nothing I want more than to be a woman.

You might think I'm exaggerating, but I'm not. My life really is that empty.
For sure. I transitioned for myself not society ya know?
i‚Äôm terrible with these ‚Äúwhat-if‚Äù scenarios because i always take them to the extreme.

i‚Äôd have to say if there was no social/interpersonal aspect of my life then there wouldn‚Äôt really be a need for me to transition. i would have no bodies to compare my own to. if no one was observing me, then i wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about whether i am read correctly. it would just be me, and i already know i‚Äôm a man. (actually, without any human interaction, i may just identify as ‚Äúhuman‚Äù. because how can something separate (a ‚Äúman‚Äù) exist unless there are other men to compare to, or women and non-binary folk to contrast to?)

if i‚Äôm still getting some level of human engagement (through something like media, for example), then i would have more reason to want to alter my body to make it align with what i identify with/value.

if a robot doctor was prescribing me testosterone, i might still take it. t does have an effect on my brain, but i think the biggest changes it makes is that i feel more comfortable existing in my body *within society* while on it (and yes, i do like how i look with the masculinization that testosterone brings to my face and body, but if it‚Äôs just me, do i *really* care how i look?). i would definitely have to reassess how i felt off of t in that situation. also, without human interaction, i would find my testosterone-induced libido pretty annoying. i still have my ovaries, so letting my body make his own hormones would just be simpler. 

i‚Äôve already had top surgery, but if i had to do it again in this hypothetical situation, i might? i never liked my chest but my main issue with it was that it prevented me from successfully living as a man. i would possibly get rid of them again only for convenience‚Äôs sake (they were large, heavy, and would sweat something fierce on the underboob).

in this hypothetical situation, i think i would actually opt for other types of modifications to change my body. can i get horns? can i get black sclera? can i get an extra 6‚Äù to my height? can i get fangs? if i‚Äôm not interacting with other people, i no longer have to worry about how my appearance will be received by them so why not go nuts?
If I didn‚Äôt have any human interaction for the rest of my life? I‚Äôd die of boredom, but yeah I‚Äôd absolutely still transition.
Yes. Absolutely.
Yes I still would, the social aspects are a big part but it's also how I want to see myself, matching up who I am mentally and physically for me.

I spend a good chunk of time alone and feel so much more at ease with myself now than pre-transition. So still definitely would no question.
I work from home and generally stay in Sunday to Thursday, so I'm basically doing that already bar the couple of work friends and my gf lol
Fwiw, when you go a decade or more without any friends or family, you begin to barely understand the immense trauma, damage and excruciatingly horrible pain of what you're talking about. Being a pariah, excluded and isolated is much worse than most can ever imagine, especially when your own ""community"" contributes excessively due to classism and selfishness. 0l

Transition without the necessary resources is worse than death for many of us. 

I expect downvotes and massive silencing of this reality to ensue. That is the new social media cancelling way.
holy shit that was eye opening - I've been questioning if I should come out/transition lately and the second I read your title I was like, ""Yes??? Of course if I was able to transition without anyone being able to criticize I would!""

And then I realized - Now I feel VERY validated, thanks OP :))
If i had a job, earned money and still hadn't to talk to anyone, i would transition earlier than i'm planning. But i would take it much easier.
I absolutely agree. Even if i never had to interact with others, the experience of existing in a body that isnt mine is distressing or just very dissociative. Ever since starting T i can slowly start seeing my body as mine, my voice is sounding more like how i hear myself in my head, and it feels like my emotions are getting regulated in the best ways. Im transitioning to not just love the body i exist in, but to make the body *mine*
The fear of judgement by other people is what held me back from transitioning for a while. If I didn‚Äôt have to interact with people I would have transitioned earlier.
I think that's exactly why we're seeing so many if us cracking during the pandemic. Without the noise and expectations, it's so much easier to be ourselves.
I would transition and become best friends with a football.
Fuck yes. Its not about anyone else, its about me and who I see looking back at me from the mirror.
Are we talking biblical-rapture style, here? Like the world is still here but everyone else is gone? If I was the last woman on earth the FIRST thing I'm doing is burning my old wardobe and walking naked to a mall for a shopping spree.
Absolutely. Even when I was in 1st or 2nd grade, I would randomly cry about ""not wanting to be a girl"" but I didn't understand why I felt that way so I just ignored my feelings. If I could have transitioned, if I knew what that was at the time, I absolutely would have done it - but I had no idea what the LGBTQ community was. I just knew I wanted to somehow transition, but I didn't know what to call it or how to do it. If I never interacted with any humans ever up until that point, I would absolutely still decide to transition.

This is a little off-topic, but this is also why I think it's very important for LGBTQ stuff to be taught in schools or at least talked about. It would have saved me so many years of confusion and random breakdowns in bed if I knew what being trans was
Where is this mysterious island of nobody but trees of estrogen and transformation fruit that is devoid of human contact?

Asking for some friends...
What? Yeah, of course! That would make everything so much easier
Yes
hell yes i would! im not transitioning for anyone but myself
probably not medically. maybe hormones. I'd like hormones. but I don't have too much body dysphoria. Actually the body dysphoria I do have mostly comes from thinking that other people think I look like a man lol
Yeah... I mean... A big part of the reason I transitioned was because of body dysphoria so... I'd transition for that regardless of human contact.
Definitely. Wouldn‚Äôt voice train though lol
I transitioned for me, not for anybody else. The presence or absence of other people just doesn't figure into it.

Ironically, not transitioning is something I did for other people for a long time, so obviously their presence figured into that decision more than anything else.

I'll always regret not transitioning sooner, but I just have to keep looking forward at this point.
Yes, pne of my fantasies was to have a desert city for my self to be able to transition in peace
Absolutely. Most of my dysphoria is physical rather than social.
It's all about me. None of it is about them but they sure do like to personalize it.
Lmaoooo I am literally isolated from humans already as it is, I would hop on that so fast
I think of I never had to interact with anyone, I WOULD transitions.
With no hesitation I absolutely would still have done it. 

Hell, not talking to other people would be kind of a bonus tbh.
Abso-fuckin-lutley. shit would be way easier.
The biggest obstacle for me is transphobia and how other people treat me because I‚Äôm trans. If I never had to talk to anyone again I would be so happy and never anxious again lmao
Yes! No more fear of others not accepting!
Would I transition, yes! Absolutely, 100 percent I would. I'm not transitioning for anyone else, I'm doing it for me. Would I be happy, no, but not because of the reasons I am not happy now. I'd miss the fun of my d&d games, or spending time with a partner, but I would at least know that as miserable as I would be I would be my true self
Id be much more likely to transition all the way to be honest.
""Yes and . . . ""

I would do it to be more comfortable with my body. But the way I'm treated by people around me is definitely a factor in my transition. Being perceived as male/masculine is uncomfortable for me. 

Transition is both to be more comfortable with myself and to correct the perceptions that other people have of me.
On one hand yes ide transition cause dysphoria when I‚Äôm by myself is real, but ide definitely take more creative liberties with my transition if I was alone on an island with the stuff I needed to be comfortable magically delivered by unmanned boats. It would actually be cool minus the lag on my new island Xbox
Yes, absolutely. My transition is for *me*, first and foremost. I want to see myself the way I feel, and I don't need anybody else. Would be nice, though. :)
yes.
This will make the transition better not worst
Yes! It‚Äôs not about anyone else but me I wish to be comfortable in my own skin. In your scenario I hope my treatment team is still around though I am kind of fond of them! Ok and the kids and spouse! But the answer is yes.
I already barely socialize outside of work, also i feel like if anything itd make it easier. Removes the whole 'people perceiving me' part yknow
I mean that would be my worst nightmare because I‚Äôm a people-loving extrovert but I‚Äôd certainly at least still act & dress female, because I am. As for the other stuff, I‚Äôd certainly do something about my facial hair sooner than otherwise with less to distract me. But I‚Äôd feel less societal pressure to go further.
You really asking, would you eat for the rest of your life or drink water...
Probably. But life would probably be pretty short with no human interaction.
I would also choose to transition. I want to because I want to so I could do certain stuff I always wanted to
i would absolutely still transition. i don‚Äôt want top surgery to make other people happy, i want top surgery to make myself happy. making other people see me as more of a woman is just a plus.
Considering I was crossdressing when no one else was around, yes. But, the question assumes I'm the last person left alive on the planet and forget gender at that point because all of culture in general goes up in smoke. Gender is a social construct, if there are no people, there is no society, there is no ""social"" anything.

Feel like I'd have bigger more basic pressing issues then, like food, electricity, clean water...
Yes. Absolutely. 100000000%. Without any doubt. I can‚Äôt imagine why I wouldn‚Äôt. 

Transitioning is for me, not them.
Yes. I want titties
Yeah, have to agree with the majority here. It would only make things easier for me and ease a huge amount of anxiety around transition.
YES!! I would still transition.  My desire to gave a body which my brain's pre-wiring plugs in to... is that strong.

I have always known that I had female breasts, they just were not there.  I have always known that I have a vagina, I just don't have a connection into it from the outside.

I have always been a female, even though I never believed or even considered that could even be possible... because, penis.

I was never transgender before, because I didn't know transgender existed.  Well, it did, but only for some extremely miniscule number of people that might find an article here or there about. I would no more have considered that I was transgender because of the existence of ""those people""... than I believe I have 380 million dollars in my checking account because im NYC, someone won $380 million yesterday. Just because it happened to someone else... by no means means it happened to me.

Except, of course, it did.

The more I learned about it, the more I saw myself at every age of my lifetime. The more I saw a *girl*... at every age of my lifetime.

Sorry, was just reminiscing.  Yes, I would.  Yes, it's that strong
Absolutely. When I'm home alone, I don't wear men's clothes or even PJ's. I'd still put in my breast forms and wear skirts, dresses, etc. I might eschew makeup though if I never saw anyone else. The makeup makes me feel better when I'm somewhere without a mask on.
I haven't started anything yet but, no interaction would be amazing. People are the reason I haven't started anything.
I would. For me, (as big as it is for me) it's less a matter of how other people see me, and more a matter of whether or not I'm comfortable in my own body.
Yes.
For me, transitioning is largely about feeling at home in my body. The social changes are more of a mixed bag - overall good, but not the primary motivation for me. 

&#x200B;

If I had to choose between ""having exactly the body I want but being seen and treated as my AGAB"" versus ""keeping the same body, yet being seen and treated as my actual gender"" then I would choose the body changes without hesitation.
Fuck. Yes.
After thinking about it, yes, I would. 

It would make a lot of things easier but a lot of things harder but when it comes down to it, I was already alone and unhappy pretending to be a man. I've felt actual happiness just from breathing since getting on HRT and I've never felt that in my entire adult life. 

I still have my hairy face. I don't have breasts. My groin doesn't look or feel right but I didn't wake up this morning disappointed that I'm still here. I still have a long way to go and a lot of work to do but right now, I'm happy to be breathing and to see that there is a path forward. 

I'd like for part of that path forward to be to find someone to be with and that I can help along with their life but this is not the linchpin to my happiness.
So, in my very long journey to discover a meaningful ""why"" to justify how I felt before I was fully out of my egg, I came to a couple little thought experiments.

And, I asked myself, if I didn't have to worry about anyone else in the world. Nobody else mattered, and nobody would know. Would I still take that magic potion to change? And, at least, for me, it was a yes. 

At the end of the day, it's something I needed for myself. If anything, the existance of other people and their beliefs were one of the few things that made it more of a stressful thing that I tried to avoid and convince myself out of.
I feel it's my anxiety about human interactions that are holding me back from a move towards transitioning.  If it was just me on my own, hell yes!
Yes
Yes I would, I want to feel good with myself and feel comfortable  
Especially with my breast. I love to go swimming some day again but I just feel hella uncomfortable, even if I went swimming by myself.
Fuck yes. The only thing holding me back is other people. I face scrutiny, hate and harassment near daily. It would be so much easier without human interaction
Yeah of course. I have to spend 100% of my time with my body, I want to at least not absolutely loathe it.
Transmasc here.

Most of my dysphoria is social, or physical but related to how people perceive and subsequently gender a body that has breasts. I think if I just never saw other people ever again starting now, I‚Äôd still transition. Spending decades around people whose actions impacted my life shapes my perspective on everything‚Äîwhich is just how existing in society works‚Äîand will continue to, even if all that is permanently in the past.

Also, I was already frustrated with having periods long before I discovered my gender.
I would say that I would even do it more. But, I would perish from the lack of human interaction.
I honestly dont think i would. Because i would never have had a concept of gender. My body makes me uncomfortable because it doesnt match my gender. If i never had a concept of gender i wouldnt really care about my body and would just exist.
Yes absolutely
I mean, obviously. To me, the more relevant question is: ""Knowing that you'll have to live in the shitty world we do, would you transition?"" And for me the answer was yes. But if not for all the judgment and weird looks and legal issues and everything else that goes with transition that comes from *other people*, it would be a much easier choice.
Yes. A girl hermit is better than being a boy.
100% yes
I‚Äôm not transitioning for other people. I did it for me. I started transitioning to help my dysphoria and make me happy with myself. So yeah‚Äîhundred percent would have started transitioning even if no one were looking. It‚Äôs about me, not them.
i agree 100%, i'd transition no matter what. put simply: gender dysphoria is a bitch.
100% agree, if it was about public perception then it honestly would probably be easier for me to not transition at all, but this has nothing to do with public perception, it is for me and me alone, so I would certainly do it even if no one ever actually saw it.
Id take all the steps immediatly
Man can this happen, people suck ass I don't wanna talk to them
Yes
Hell yes, it's not about others it's about justice for me.
Hell yeah, its about me not anyone else. Its for my comfort not theirs im not gonna suffer just because i cant talk to people
hell yeah. absolutely
I would transition and it'd be easier because if I get a shitty haircut then nobody gets to see me with it
I'd still be stuck with myself, wouldn't I?
Yeah
Yes

I‚Äôve always coped well with isolation, and normally preferred it anyway. Most of my anxiety(outside of body dysphoria) comes from social situations.

Never having to interact with any human being ever would be an acceptable tradeoff for the ability to go a day without wanting to drive a knife into my stomach.
Actually this would motivate me to transition because I would know that no one would judge me
Yeah totally (tho not looking for surgeries myself), I'd love to have my face always be smooth wirhout constant maintenance, and I'd love to be able to look down and see boobs there
100%. it wouldn‚Äôt affect my decision at all actually. i‚Äôm transitioning for me, not for everyone else. being comfortable in my skin is top priority
lol assuming I have any human interaction now
If I never had to interact with anyone again, I‚Äôd start my transition this second. What‚Äôs keeping me is the dear of what others will think
yeag
The only reason I haven‚Äôt done it yet is BECAUSE of human interaction. Also ADHD being a bitch but yknow.
Yes I want tiddy and better hips and a cuter face and I've wanted that since I was 14 years old.
My transition (and while I am cautious to speak for all trans people, I imagine most if not all of us) has nothing to do with *other* people. If my identity was decided based on other people, then I wouldn't have transitioned... because a lot of (cis) people treat us very poorly for it and don't want us to do it.

I think the problem is that a lot of cis people assume that trans people transition for attention, but I don't think any of us want being trans to be a focal point of how we're viewed by other people... which means that if being trans is getting us any attention, then it's probably not the kind that we want. üò≥
Yes lol
I would have transitioned sooner
Oh fuck yes. No question at all. HRT is one of the best things ever to happen to me
..If It succesfully gets me what I want, then yes, definitely, a lot of cis people don't understand it. In fact, If I wouldn't interact with others I would do it sooner because I wouldn't feel all ashamed or scared of others their judgement. On the other hand, if I never had social interactions at all, I wouldn't really realize what I was missing/wanted in the first place so the option would have to be presented to me first.
üíØ this is definitely it for me.  I'm transitioning for me.  Sure it'd be nice to pass in public for safety reasons, but the goal has always been to feel comfortable and happy in my own skin.
Yes, I would still want to transition. I much rather enjoy having estrogen be my primary hormone than testosterone. If I never had anymore human interaction, I could freely wear whatever feminine clothing I want without fear of judgement or harassment.
Same. I would still medically transition regardless, because I am still stuck in this body. I won't transition for others, I will do it for myself. Especially considering I'm nonbinary and there is nothing I can pass as, it's not like I'm going to fit in to society or whatever anyway.
If I had no human interaction I'm pretty sure I'd kill myself.
Well, yeah. In some ways, it would be way easier to transition if I didn't ever have to interact with anybody else.

It wouldn't do anything for my social dysphoria over being excluded from the sisterhood of women, but that wouldn't be any *worse* than I have it now, so...
Yes, but it would be easier meaning that I could transition to whatever stage  I want I guess. I wouldnt have the societal pressures of whats masculine or whats feminine like ""oh thats what a man does"" and vice versa. A lot of times when i think about transitioning I honestly feel like its heavily motivated by what society tells me what women ought to be and what men ought to be :/
Yes, I would too, I mean my psychiatrist asked me a similar question when I said I was trans he asked ""if everyone on the planet had no gender at all, including you, would you still want to transition?"" I mean, yes.
I agree, completely
Probably not. Because I wouldnt have people reminding me daily that how my body looks is what defines me.
100%. I'm myself no matter if there's other people around, I'm doing everything for me not for anyone else.  
if anything, would be even easier.
Yeah, I'm transitioning because my mind punismshes me if I don't and it gives me euphoria if I do so.
Oddly enough, that might actually make me feel able to transition.
Yes. I would 100% still transition.
Yes
No, I wouldn‚Äôt do anything. I wouldn‚Äôt be me if I couldn‚Äôt interact with anyone or has relationship. I would probably overdose or go clinically insane. I do transition because I relate to men as a woman. If I can‚Äôt talk to men again or have relationship with  anyone, I would like I said be clinically insane
Would still transition, even if id never see someone else again dysphoria wont leave me the fuck alone.
Would make it easier but also extremely difficult because I need people to talk to sometimes.
If you're talking about never interacting with any human (irl or through media) since birth, then most likely no. 
As there's no point of reference there's nothing transition into and no urge to do it. 

But if you're talking about no interactions with any human from now one, then definitely yes. I'm not transitioning for other people. I want to do it because I want my body to look a certain way. So as long as I can see my body I'll want to transition
Physically yes, socially... probably...the cloths are so much prettier. If anything, everything would be so much easier
I would definitely still transition. I see it as something I am doing 100% for myself because I deserve to represent that which is an essential part of my being in a physical manner. I deserve for the mental pains of dysphoria to go away and I will make it so.
We exist in reference to others. There is no self without how that self relates to other people and larger community and overall society. This is why solitary confinement is considered such horrible torture, it strips you of your own identity and feeling of existence. If I had never had a conversation with another person, I wouldn't have a conception of myself or a reference to compare myself agasint, much less a desire to transition.
This argument kind of erases people who are primarily socially dysphoric. Because the reality is we live in a society. And there is a variety of dysphoria. If I'm alone on an island there's no one there to tell me I'm not a man (ftm). There's no other men to compare to. There's no rules what a man is, how a man moves, what traits a man has, what hobbies a man likes. Of course you're valid in internal dysphoria and I acknowledge how difficult that is. But society forms a significant amount of the environment we move through in life and how we are perceived in that environment. There is a variety of dysphoria and I guess I'm saying this here because internal dysphoria is the only dysphoria I see acknowledged and I see this island scenario quite a bit.
I literally live alone in the woods. 

Answer is always yes.
I would have even less hesitation about it.
Absolutely!   I‚Äôm doing this for me‚Ä¶
Given that the biggest hurdle to me presenting as my gender in public right now is my fear of how I'll be treated...
Honestly I would rather kill myself then. I don't want to be a woman just to exist, I want to be a woman to live, love as woman, etc that all requires interactions.
Hell yes. My partner & I are aiming for living off grid eventually. My egg has only just cracked at 28 & I would 100% still be myself even if it was just for me.
Yes

This is not me
Yes
Yes. I am transitioning for me, not the world.
I feel like I‚Äôd‚Ä¶ be a lot more comfortable tbh. And I might not even really transition. I already fit the idea of ‚Äúme‚Äù, I guess, but I don‚Äôt fit the idea of me to anybody else. So I have to transition and look different and present differently to be that me to them, I guess? Thinking about this question actually answered a lot of questions about myself, so thank you. I‚Äôm ‚Äúhappy‚Äù as I am, just not happy about how I‚Äôm perceived.
Yup. I‚Äôm transitioning for me and nobody else. How other people see me or what they think of me is none of my damn business.
honestly even though i did interact with people throughout it i didn‚Äôt do it because of anyone but me in fact i did it despite several people. for me it‚Äôs always been about my mental health and my ability to feel comfortable in my own body and i think i‚Äôd do it again no matter what the circumstances
I'm transitioning for myself and for my own mental health; not for others. In fact, from a theory point, it would make this a lot easier. The fear of not knowing what will happen and believe it'll be always something bad...

I'll miss my good friend that at this point in my life I consider them really good ones and they're supporting a lot with this but I can deal with not speak with the rest of the world.
Well, no shit. Im not transitioning for other people.
Yes. I hardly socialization now, and i‚Äôm still transitioning
hell fucking yeah i already barely have human interaction
I would be more likely to transition. The fear of how others may react even violently and then being unable to hide my transness is something visceral that I'm considering now that my breast augmentation has been approved.
I may be in the minority, but I don't actually feel much disphoria from my interactions with others. It really is more about how I see myself, especially when I catch myself in the mirror on a bad day. So yea, have to agree, would still transition even if I never met another person, because it's about how I feel and what I see with my own eyes that matters
Harder yes
Not being a trans, I would have to support your position. As the mind is very powerful, snd if this what you need to complete yourself than do it.  Not as drastic as your transition, but I need to loose a 100#‚Äôs.  I‚Äôve done 150, with bariatric surgery, but that final 100#‚Äôs would leave me with too much excess skin, that I really don‚Äôt want to deal with.
Hell yeah, I‚Äôll destroy the universe to become the opposite gender
Makes me more likely to transition ngl
Yes. Whether I interact with others or not doesn't matter, at the end of the day my gender identity doesn't match the body I have
How would you get your pills, doctor recommendations, surgeries, hair removal, and advice if you have 0 human interaction? Gonna make your own pills? Perform your own bottom surgery? Even the trans community itself is ‚Äúhuman interaction‚Äù

Hate to say it but sounds like you genuinely rely on advanced modern society to get you to where you want to be; instead, why not say: ‚ÄúIf you never had any human interaction ever again, would you love yourself for who you are?‚Äù

If no, maybe seek some help frens
yes. i would.
This is actually one of my biggest (irrational) fears; that if I transitioned no one would talk to me for rest of my life, at least, not in a connected or meaningful way.
If I‚Äôm honest it‚Äôs one of my biggest hurdles.  I need people in my life.
I probably would. but at the same time I probably wouldn‚Äôt just because I don‚Äôt think I can really imagine a world without human interaction (at least online) I mean I ain‚Äôt a sociable girl AT ALL but loneliness is still a main factor on why I feel like shit all day so I probably would just feel very shitty all day and want to just lay down in bed. leading to eventually bot doing it
I dunno, picking between not transitioning and no human contact ever again is like picking between bubonic plague and cholera, both options suck and I probably wouldn‚Äôt live long either way
It would be hard for me to get the surgery I want without interaction with other humans but I absolutely would do it!
Oh hell yeah. 

Because then at least I wouldn't be paranoid people can read me. 

I wanna transition for me and me alone. These parts aren't mine and I especially don't wanna live with them if it's just gonna be me on my own. 

I'm the one who's gotta live with me and for me to fully enjoy thay that means transition even if I never talk to anyone ever again.
Idk how I'd get access to T or top surgery, but absolutely. It's for my own comfort more so than other people's
OMG, saaaame
Right? Literally all of my hesitation is around how other people will react.
Agree
Sooner? I think you mean right the fuck now
Yep, would have started like at 18 probably.
I think about this so often. I would have never detransitioned due to fear and I would have started transitioning way sooner
Came in to say exactly this. And in a way, of my three years transitioned, two have been during a pandemic where I don't really go out and do anything anyway...so that kind of did happen...
Same. I'm MTF pre everything. Still doubting about medical transition. But... If I never had to interact with anyone else ever, I would start hrt right now.
This 100%. As a person of mixed color who is acutely aware of most senses of ""passing"" are irrevocably entwined with whiteness, if I didn't have to interact with anyone ever again, it would make transition 1000 times less emotionally anguishing for me because I wouldn't be saddled with the fear of how I would turn out or be facing the terrifying reality that trans POC are killed at almost 10 times the rate of white trans people.
If I never had to deal with another human being my idea of femininity would become so abstracted I would never feel imposter syndrome. I would just change my body and develop habits and mannerisms that makes me feel better about myself
I just had this thought experiment internally while listening to a podcast about Castaway.

If I knew I'd be on a deserted island, and had a chance for any kind of prep or supplies, I would desperately try to make hormones one of those things. I want to be me, to grow toward me, like, as opposed to there *being no me*. 

Like, if it's gonna just be me, alone, damn straight I want to at a bare minimum feel like I *exist*.

Caverns of Socrates is a great metaphor. If that person who saw the true world was told they would be alone now, you can be damn sure they are going to pick bring alone while have sunshine on their face.
100%
I agree, for me. I feel a lot of the pressure to FULLY transition and do it quickly is from society as well. If I never had to talk to someone again, I‚Äôd probably just wear clothes I like more and act more like I want. I wouldn‚Äôt have to worry about how others perceive my gender, only how I perceive myself.
Oh, I completely agree with that. Being seen, accepted and interacting with the world as a woman is a big part of my transition. But I wanted to make the point to my friend that a big chunk of why I'm transitioning has nothing to do with other people.
No, I get it. At one point in my 20s I cut off all human contact because so many of my 'friendships' were toxic...

I'm now married and have a small handful of friends, but I've maintained a lot of the boundaries that I set up after that dark time of my life.
THIS THIS THIS.   


I've just started my transition process (MtF), but this exact question has been nagging at me constantly now. I feel like I would LOVE to transition and be a woman in every stereotypical way, but then I realize that probably a large reason I feel that way is because I exist in a social world around humans. If it was just me alone in the wilderness I would just accept myself as human like you mentioned.   


This definitely makes me doubt myself, but I also have to accept that I don't live in a hypothetical and I will probably never be able to remove myself from some sort of societal interaction.
No, this is exactly the thought process I had.

I mean, its just me in the shower, so why do I avoid looking down?

Its just me in the mirror, so why do I avoid it?
No prob! It felt validating to me to explain it to my friend that way and seeing them nod in understanding.

Granted, for me, this is just part of why I want to transition. Another big part of it is to actually interact with others as a woman and be seen and accepted that way.
Ha! I was thinking that I could ditch all the effort I'm putting into voice training!
Nah, I wasn't assuming you're the last person on earth. I actually had it in my head that you'd just go about your life as normal, but just not have to talk or interact with anyone.
I actually came to the realization by asking myself of being a woman would make it easier for me to deal with others. A big part of my transition is to experience interacting with others as a woman, but I would totally transition if in total isolation as well.
I almost did because of human interaction...

I'm way better now...

I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically.
Not since birth, that's way too speculative as you'd never be able to predict how you develop mentally through childhood with no human contact (even if you could solve the practical problems like food, hygiene, medical care, etc).

And I don't even mean never seeing another person ever again (empty earth scenario). I just mean living without trying to form any relationships with other people, no conversations, no friendships, every interaction limited to the smallest, least amount. (This is based on a period of my life where I actually lived like this for a little over a year.)
I never said anything about an island, and didn't say anything about not living in a society. I know many commenters have made that assumption, but that's not where I was going.

I personally have lived times of my life completely socially isolated, by choice, because of not being able to properly socialize with people. I still struggle with it, and I believe a majority of the reasons for these struggles is that I was subconsciously a woman trying to interact with people but them seeing only an awkward man. While in college, I lived for over a year barely saying more than ""hi"", ""thanks"", ""yes"" or ""no"" to the various people that I had to interact with (clerks at a store, classmates, members of the public), and for those people I had to have more communication with (family, college professors, etc), I kept it as short as possible.
i think i mean 30 years ago lmao
Yes. I live here, not a hypothetical. So answering the question might give me a new perspective or an opportunity for self-reflection but ultimately transition is what I need here.
>i live here

YES! YES! THIS!!     
it doesn‚Äôt matter if we transition for societal reasons because *we live in a society!* it doesn‚Äôt matter that gender is a construct, because *the constructed thing has a function in the world we live in!* we‚Äôre playing by the rules of a game we can‚Äôt fully opt out of, and we‚Äôre exploiting the loopholes in order to live in a way that‚Äôs most comfortable and authentic to us. there‚Äôs nothing wrong with that.
the thing is, though, it‚Äôs not *just* you in the mirror/shower. it‚Äôs also all the bagage/memories/assumptions/insecurities/messages from the outside world that you are bringing in with you in your alone times. you can‚Äôt fully separate yourself from it.

after being alone for a month, i‚Äôm pretty sure your mindset would change. (maybe not completely, but probably at least a little)
oops i replied to the wrong one lol
True.

I've been alone for extended periods of time. Before I realized I was trans, when traveling I would go days without seeing myself in a mirror, and completely enjoyed it, but I would still avoid looking at my own body when showering.

Since realizing I was trans and started transition, if I'm in a similar traveling situation, I find I occasionally want to look at myself in the mirror to see if I see him or her. Seeing her makes me feel good. Seeing him is jarring."	ski19k	trans	1017	0.99	2022-02-04 16:48:04
Am I in the wrong?	"UPDATE: well guys I was right that I might not get therapy if I told. I told my psychiatrist and she thought she was bad too. And told my mom but my mom decided to tell my therapist everything I said about her. And my therapist kept going on and on about how manipulative I am. And how she doesn‚Äôt want to work with me but she has bc I have attachment issues. My mom just came into my room today and told me I can‚Äôt get another therapist. I asked why and she gave me a bs answer. I can‚Äôt wait to get the hell out of this house




So today in therapy I started talking about me being transmasc n stuff. And she started to mention that people that undergo hormones and surgery become more suicidal than when they didn‚Äôt do that. I told her I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true Bc a lot of trans people are more suicidal if they don‚Äôt get confirmation surgery. But she didn‚Äôt listen. Then I was talking about how I don‚Äôt see me in the mirror and then she said ‚Äúyou‚Äôre beautiful‚Äù then I told her I don‚Äôt like that word but she still called me beautiful again. Then she was talking about a kid around my age than underwent confirmation surgery and now they running around saying they want commit on tiktok Bc they had the surgery( I don‚Äôt think that‚Äôs true Bc I think somebody passed a bill where I live that minors can‚Äôt have hormones or surgery) then she told me that I will never be a man no matter what I do. That shit hurt. Then she started comparing confirmation surgery to Michael Jackson‚Äôs nose surgery. And I tried to explain to her that plastic surgery is very different from gender confirmation surgery. But she didn‚Äôt listen. She don‚Äôt understand gender dysphoria is different than just hating your body. Like I told her I tried to give myself top surgery this weekend but she did not care. She also mentioned she right wing but that had nothing to do with what she told me I think she‚Äôs getting her facts off a unreliable source tbh. Am I in the wrong? Or Do I just really hate the feminine parts of my body? Yo please tell me I need answers"	"New therapist time if you ask me
A lot of people are saying get a new therapist, but from your replies it seems like that‚Äôs not an option. Sometimes, no therapist is better than a bad therapist. If the therapist isn‚Äôt supporting you and is clearly dangerously misinformed, then not seeing them anymore- even if that means you don‚Äôt have a therapist- may be the best option. Medical trauma from therapists is a real and damaging thing. You have to weigh whether any help you‚Äôre getting from this person is worth the hurt.
This is a very transphobic therapist who is abusing her position to convince trans people they aren‚Äôt trans. This person needs to lose their license
Depending on your state/country that may be extremely illegal. I'd recommend checking your local laws first, and if the law is in your favor consider reporting them/going to court. 

Also, look into your therapists terms of service (it might not be called that, but many will have something similar), and your local laws to see if you can record the audio of the session without their knowledge. A recording of your therapists clearly going against the standard of care will be a lot more serious than just your word.
pro tip: if anyone says ""you'll regret it"" or ""lots of people regret it"", huge red flag of misinformation and/or transphobia
I'm a therapist. This level of professional ignorance is inexcusable. Unfortunately, many therapists lack the requisite understanding of LGBTQ2 issues needed be helpful and not harmful to those in the community. You are not in the wrong, your therapist is just pathetically unequipped to serve trans clients. I'd get fired for saying that kind of shit to you
I am a therapist. This is abusive and actually against the law. This person can lose their license for this. I would contact an attorney. If you can get them to stop practicing therapy entirely it is a good thing for you, and every other trans person they will damage in the future.
there is scientific evidence to the contrary. give me a minute and I'll find the study. It was about trans youth and idk how old you are but regardless I'll find the study and link it here in a minute. trans health care is life saving with an incredibly low regret rate especially when compared to other life saving medical procedure.

Edit: https://www.jahonline.org/article/S1054-139X(21)00568-1/fulltext

if you're not used to reading scientific papers, scroll to the table, there's a column for percentages of trans kids who didn't receive gender affirming cards and a colimn for kids who did receive gender affirming care, the instances of depression and suicide decreases when trans kids get gender affirming treatment. Not increases. Anyone who says otherwise is either ignorant or willfully denying science. 

This study references some other good studies, such as one where 0 out of 80 respondents regretted their transition. usually the numbers I read are around a 1% or less regret rate. for medical procedures of ANY kind that's STRIKINGLY low. Mastectomies and chemo for cancers do not have that low a regret rate. Sometimes transphobes will reference studies that show that gender dysphoria is a rapid onset social contagion among teens, but this is based on studies where unaccepting critical PARENTS of the children were surveyed and the trans kids opinions were not considered. Refer to Brie Hanrahan's article ""A reasonable person's guide to the jk Rowling article"" for more debunking of the poor excuse for science that transphobes use to try to create the idea of regret.

But one thing I wanna say is that, of course the science is on our side, and a lot of transphobes know that deep down. You can find well researched peer reviewed literature that shows trans healthcare is good and low risk and incredibly effective, but you don't have an obligation to argue your own existence. you CAN cite your sources on why trans healthcare is a positive, but you shouldn't have to and transphobes don't care if you do most the time. You don't have to argue for your existence.
Nope, done. Find a new therapist. She's more interested in defending her worldview than your mental health.

YOU are fine. And need a clean clear space so you can figure out the path to what you want, whatever that is. She's not capable of giving you that. Drop her like a bad habit.

I really hesitate to say the next part, but.. it might be time to end therapy if she won't leave it alone. She can actively make the whole thing worse. If your parents won't let you switch, lock in on developing the skills you need to be independent. Dive into learning how to budget, extra cheap meals, how to write a resume, all the things like that. Use that as an armor and just get through the next few years so you can go when it's time.  


Make sure you have copies of your paperwork- your birth certificate, ssn (if you're from the states) all the things you need to prove who you are.
That therapist is transphobic and regardless their factually wrong.
She shouldnt even have her job. Thats unbelievably screwed up. 

1: shes invaliding gender dysphoria which is a diagnosable condition

2: she told you her political position which is extremely unprofessional 

3: you mentioned you attempted to harm yourself by preforming your own surgery and she did not mentally evaluate you for being at a potential risk of self harm or worse

4: shes pushing her personal opinions on you about your transition 

5: she doesn't respect your boundaries about the language she uses

6: shes comparing you to the experience of other people
A therapist who ignores basic facts you can google is a hack. This therapist doesn‚Äôt understand or care about you my guy. You deserve to be happy, no matter where you find it.
Hi hello. Not an expert by any means, but while i‚Äôm college I did a few research papers on the LGBTQ+ community, as well as the trans community specifically. Every single peer reviewed paper I found reported significantly less suicidality and depression as trans people underwent physical transitioning.
New therapist
You are not in the wrong. That is a bad therapist who does not believe in actual research and facts. She is trying to push her own transphobic agenda. I would stop going to her and leave bad reviews warning other people if that is an option.
Okay so some thoughts.

Although it varies from state to state, where I am (and most places afaik) ""Therapist"" is not a term regulated by the government. Anyone with a pen and a piece of cardstock can put up a sign claiming to be a therapist and charge money for sessions. Now obviously I don't know the woman you're talking about, and if she uses the terms ""counselor"", ""psychologist"", or ""psychiatrist"" there's a much higher probability she went through some actual schooling, but the next time you're at her office I would see if there's any information about her actual job title (business cards, signage, degrees on walls, etc).

It's certainly not impossible that someone with technical competency would be so blatantly biased against their clientele but that raises my eye brows, especially when you mentioned that your parents denied you access to another option. There's a certain subset of the ""therapy"" crowd who identify themselves as 'christian counselors' or something similar (not certain as counselor does tend to be regulated to my knowledge, but counselor is a comparatively low rung on the ladder of mental health professionals so bigots making their way to such positions is more believable.) 

These people by and large won't help you with trans issues. They won't affirm your gender identity, they won't be knowledgeable enough to help you even if they wanted to, and they CERTAINLY won't help you get HRT. In fact, even aside from any trans stuff I would expect whatever advice they give you to be filtered through the ever-giving lens of ""christian love"" so I wouldn't expect her to be of any help at all, to be honest.

If I were in your position and they wouldn't let me switch to a better fitting option, I would stop going entirely. If they're going to make you go, there's nothing they can do to make you talk. Sometimes all you can do is buckle down and weather the storm, and that's okay. Just know that better days are coming, and *know* that you have the strength to make it through this, okay? If you ever need to talk my DMs are open. Currently working my way through undergrad as a psychology student so I might know a thing or two about a thing or two, but first and foremost I'm a friend to talk to and an ear to listen.

much love ‚ù§Ô∏è
I say this as a therapist. You must stop seeing her. She is doing you far, far more harm than no therapist at all. Imagine a dentist that chisels random cracks into your teeth. Would you say ""they were the only one you had?"" If your parents ""won't let"" you stop seeing her, then you need to sit silently, playing on your phone, for the duration of your session. She can only harm you psychiatrically.
Please don't diminish or excuse what they did or think there is any ambiguity here: you did nothing wrong. This therapist's comments should be grounds for losing whatever license they have. Their comments were absolutely unacceptable.

Report that therapist to the relevant licensing authority. It isn't their role to push their individual opinion of a client's issue.
I would call the clinic and report her if you feel comfortable doing so they are there to listen and support you their ways telling you otherwise is against therapy
Jeez are you seeing the same one I went to? Mine did the exact same thing with me.
Sounds like the type of therapist transphobes send you to to try to ""change your mind/cure you/ get you back on God's path / whatever else nonsense""
This is not a good therapist. I would report her.
Your therapist doesn't know how to treat trans people. She's actively taking steps that increase her patients' risk of mental illness, self harm, and suicide. Find a new therapist and warn anyone you feel safe enough to tell about never going to her.

I say this as someone with a PhD in sociology whose field of expertise is sexual and gender minority population health: every single thing she is doing is known to profoundly negatively impact trans people's well-being.
She is waaaaaaay wrong and is doing harm.
How dose that therapist have a job still
Yikes. This is a very bad therapist.

From what youve said in comments it sounds like you're not in a good home situation. Please don't give up. You may have to be in survival mode for a while. It may feel like you'll never get through it, like it's an eternity. Please don't give up. Get through each day.

One day you'll be 18 and that long slog will have earned you a whole life on the other side that is all your own. It won't be easy, but you'll be able to move away from your parents, to a place where you will be be accepted and be able to find therapists and doctors who will respect you for who you are.

In the meantime, do what you have to to stay alive. If it's available, finding an LGBT youth group with supportive adult leaders could be a lifeline.
She's absolutely horrible at being a therapist. Not only is she CLEARLY not fit for the job, but therapists should NEVER talk about their political views in a way that is used against you.
Gross. She sounds like a right wing fox news addict to me. She's getting her information and her ideology and her personality directly from old white dudes who don't even know what the fuck they're talking about, in regards to literally anything. 

She's %40000 wrong.  

Also you can be trans and hate the feminine parts of your body. I'm a trans man and I came close a few times to DIY top surgery because the dysphoria is killing me. 

Find someone who knows how to do their job and actually listen to their patient and do a better job of providing accurate help, instead of just making it worse.
Well, she sounds toxic AF. Whether transitioning is or isn‚Äôt right for you‚Ä¶ the way she responded to you is highly irresponsible. Get a new therapist or at the very least, stop seeing her. I wouldn‚Äôt not trust her with anything after receiving such an obviously biased response to a very complex topic.
If your parents dont let you change therapists then no longer talk to her. if you have to show up, refuse to talk to her.
You can report her for that, the clinic should have the information posted somewhere, like maybe the wall in the waiting room. 

And no, you are absolutely correct.  Family support alone decreases the risk of suicide about 50%, and actual transition is so, so helpful for mental health. I transitioned in 2020 and my dysphoria is significantly decreased. Like I would have intrusive thoughts about trying to diy surgery, and I permanently fucked up my ribcage binding so tight. I distanced myself from feminine things and softness to try and be seen as anything but a girl. Transitioning has allowed me to embrace those things again. 

I recently built myself a bed with lilac and pink curtains, and two weeks ago went to a doctor's appointment in full lolita style. I looked like a frilly cupcake and it was glorious. No matter what I wear, no matter what I like, I'm not a girl.  And the freedom of not trying to either force myself to be one, or of trying to distance myself from it, has been so amazing.

Detransitioning is extremely rare. Like, not even 1% of trans folks rare. And the majority of those who detransition do so due to lack of support, bullying, etc. You know who you are. 

If being confrontational isn't your thing, check your local laws and if it's legal, start recording these therapy appointments, to start documenting what she is saying to you. If you can't, try at least keeping a journal. She is very much violating all kinds of ethics codes, and could potentially lose her license for this. 

No one, NO ONE, has the right to treat you this way. Please try and report it, and seek help from a trusted adult.
I missed that this was their therapist and now I've gone from more of a wtf that's a bad friend/person/whatever to what the FUCK how the hell does this person have a license to be a therapist??
From your replies, you need to call CPS. Or raise a stink at the clinic where the therapist works. Tell someone she's enabling your family's abuse. I know it's scary and if talking about it here helps you definitely should but nothing is going to change if you don't say anything.
You are not in the wrong 

Do what you think will help you feel more like yourself regardless of what your therapist says
[deleted]
She‚Äôs absolutely wrong. Transition saved my life. Hormones decreased my suicidal thoughts more than anything ever has.
I am almost certain she is violating some sort of ethics code as a therapist here.  
I would report her behaviour and get a new therapist.
Gate keeper fire her ass
Yeah, you ain‚Äôt in the wrong, mate. The fact that she dismissed you trying to give yourself top surgery? And not listening when you said you don‚Äôt like being called beautiful? Yeah, you‚Äôre not in the wrong, mate. I‚Äôm sorry about your therapist, mate, and don‚Äôt doubt yourself. You‚Äôre in the right.
she is not anywhere near qualified to be a therapist ! honestly, i'd try to find a online therapist rather than this one, if you can't find that i'd honestly just chat to an experienced friend, this person shouldn't be anywhere near a therapist office.
you can love the feminine parts about your body and still be a man
New Therapist, also sue for malpractice as she's quite clearly biased and follows an anti-trans ideology which is harmful to patients.

This is in direct violation of her hipocratic oath and could see her struck off if you're not the first to complain
New therapist or dump her. I was waiting for a therapist for individual speech therapy, and thet gave me a therapist who didn't even read a report sent to her months ago, it didn't work out and I couldn't get a new one, so I spoke with my mom and ageed that it wasn't going to work out and we went back on the waiting list. No therapist is better than one who disregards your feelings.
awful, disrespectful, and unprofessional. this person shouldn't be a therapist
That are so many red flags. Youre absolutely not wrong. 
Ive heard 'Why would you change, youre beautiful' too. I never found myself ugly I just never saw myself. Luck for me Ive never seen that guy again.

You got this bro! 
Ignore that gint bs if you can. You are already a real man and no shit like what she said can change that.
And you can be complete stealth. It is pretty common as FtM (dont know by MtF, sorry ladys).
She's psycho. I'd stop going if your parents won't let you see another one. I'd also report her. Going to her is more harmful than good obviously.
Absolutely untrue; the opposite is in fact true: trans gender people offered affirming therapy, including HRT etc are LESS likely to be depressed and entertain suicide.

This sounds like a conversation therapist not a supportive one
new therapist, if you can't get a new one, fuck around with her. no use in complying with somebody who doesn't want the best for you. mess with her and troll her

If she admits that she's right wing then she definitely gets her shit of unreliable sources and listening to her or telling her more could be dangerous to you.
As a future therapist I can safely say just through the entire therapist out. Therapists should be open to all patients.
I‚Äôm not sure why this popped up on my feed as I‚Äôm your typical middle aged white dude who doesn‚Äôt really know shit about being trans. That said, even with me having no idea what you‚Äôre going through I can tell you this therapist sucks.
If she works for a practice and is not private then go to her practice about it. Inform them of what she is doing and how she is treating/talking to you. That‚Äôs waaaay out of line and so beyond unethical that it‚Äôs disgusting. She could straight up be fired for shit like that and should be. If it is a private practice then go to someone else if possible. I‚Äôm so sorry that you‚Äôre going through this. That‚Äôs not right at all.
Sounds like you need a new therapist dude.  She sounds like a total misinformed dingus that shouldn't be interacting with the general public in a professional capacity.  I'd report her to whatever licensing board she got her licenses from.
Your therapist is an awful human being, to include being extremely transphobic. Don't let her give you imposter syndrome!
I've read so much of this thread, and it's just made me angrier and angrier.

My random anonymous internet brother \[I think?  Being repulsed at 'beautiful' I'm reading that as FtM, if I have it ass backwards I am so so so sorry and please correct me\]...this goes beyond a shitty therapist.  This goes WAY beyond a shitty therapist.  Thank you so much for speaking up.

Call CPS yourself...ideally the agent who handled the first report.  Call whoever made the initial report...your first therapist, I think?  Call any other mandatory reporter.  This is a very very ***very*** clear case of child abuse, and it's blatantly obvious your parents are moving you from school to school and from therapist to therapist in an attempt to cover up that they're abusing you by surrounding you with adults who are supposed to be there to help you but are instead helping them.

Please...for your sake, don't just wait this out.  The right people can get you out of there, can get you into foster care with loving/supportive foster parents, can get that therapist into so much hot water with their ethics board they can never abuse their profession to hurt anyone again.
She‚Äôs too busy pushing her views onto you which is not what therapy is about. She‚Äôs too much in her ego and not focused on YOU and YOUR needs. If therapy is ever hindering you or your mental health maybe its time to pause and think. Therapy is supposed to help you navigate what‚Äôs yours, not theirs. No one needs to be pushing their views on you. Especially when they‚Äôre getting paid.
Don‚Äôt pay her, find someone who is actually a therapist who cares about you. I have more colorful things to say but I‚Äôll leave it at that.
Jfc I would just walk out at that point
That‚Äôs a bad doctor acting in bad faith. Tell her to go fuck a truck, and find someone who will actually care about you!
You're not wrong at all, and this is similar to the exact reason I left my therapist. During my last visit, she was totally dismissive about hearing me when I talked about transitioning and trying to pass, and when I expressed that I was trying my best to dress like a man, she looked me up and down and remarked rudely ""you don't look like a boy."" (Everything i was wearing, i bought from the men's section, and i felt infantized because I was in my mid 20s at the time and prefer to be referred to as a man, not a boy.)
She sounds like about as good a therapist as my friend's homo/transphobic stepfather, who is a therapist. I do not feel safe around that man.
It sounds like this person wasn't interested in helping you plus if she's right wing those people aren't about trans people transitioning they'd rather we conform to their ideals of normal even if we suffer. My advice find another therapist ASAP
So she's just making up shit at this point?
Both your parents and therapist sound like horrible people. I'm sorry OP. Perhaps go NC with your folks once you move out they don't deserve you.
I agree with the response that you should report her because what she‚Äôs doing is illegal and dangerous.
Your therapist is a transphobes, that‚Äôs not a way to approach those kind of questions in any sense. Please find someone who is knowledgeable on the subject üíñ best wishes
I'd suggest getting a new therapist.
Your therapist is a transphobe and you need a new one.
your therapist has been hanging around too many terfs.
Stop going. Problem solved.
https://imgur.com/a/DanauE6
Who is this person?
If you feel like a man, and want to be one, then that's what you are. Simple as that.

Your therapist is clearly still stuck in the past, she's repeating generic and typical transphobic misinformation.
Yea get new therapist. What country do you live in? I know many transgendered people from the countries where it is illegal and it hurts me to see them suffer.
I would talk to someone higher up if I was you, without your parents knowing, try to tell someone else in that place that she is gaslighting her own patient and forcing her opinions on you which is something therapists aren‚Äôt supposed to do
Sounds like it‚Äôs time for a new therapist
Get a new therapist shes in the wrong and was just trying to convince you of some bullshit ur not in the wrong and you are a man even if you still have your feminine parts don't listen to her  your feelings and identity are valid :)
This sounds more like an issue that your therapist has with trans people in general tbh, you're not in the wrong at all dude.
She was abusing you
She sounds awful and like she could do more harm than good
That's not a real therapist; that's a bigot who managed to get a D or higher on like 10 tests.
as another trans person who was abused as a teenager‚Äî this is not worth it. this isn‚Äôt therapy, even‚Äî it‚Äôs just more abuse! i know this part of your life seems like it‚Äôs going to last forever, like it‚Äôll never be over‚Äî but it will be. really soon, it will be. just focus on keeping yourself as healthy and if possible happy as you can be. ditch your therapist‚Äî tell your parents she threatened you, and if that doesn‚Äôt work you can anonymously report her for threatening you. since there are no other therapists around who‚Äôll help, try some online free options. insight timer is an amazing app that‚Äôs free for everyone, it has everything from meditation to anxiety and trauma meltdown support. there are communities of survivors on there who can help you. if you have any friends whose parents are cool, ask if you can stay with them sometimes‚Äî any nights away from home in that situation is really good for you. i had a friend whose parents were awesome‚Äî they had me over all the time, and i actually converted to judaism later in life because of how kind and accepting they were, all of the holidays i spent at their house, etc. if you can get a job (i don‚Äôt know how old you are or how feasible that is) you can start saving money for later on now. if you‚Äôre too young to work, try doing odd jobs for people in your neighborhood who you‚Äôre comfortable with. nice old ladies who are frail might need help with the garbage or their gardening and might be willing to give you a twenty or something. keep the money secret from your parents‚Äî find a good hiding place. i know this isn‚Äôt really what you asked for advice on, but i‚Äôve been there and i wish i could go back and tell myself all of these things. also, if you‚Äôre ever in crisis mode, you can always call or text a hotline at the trevor project that‚Äôs specifically for lgbt teenagers https://www.thetrevorproject.org/ they have a ton of amazing resources if you haven‚Äôt been recced them already. also in case you need a lot of advice videos, alexbertie on youtube started filming his transition when i was a teenager, so his whole transition for like a decade is on youtube, documented with lots of helpful hints, tricks, etc. he‚Äôs a really nice guy as far as i know, and he really helped me a lot. i‚Äôm gonna stop typing now because this is a block, but we‚Äôre all here for you and sending a lot of love your way, man
Please, please, PLEASE get away from this fucking monster. She should have her license yanked--and depending  on which state you live in, she will if you report her. 

She is so wrong and so full of shit on so many things she told you, that for you to go back to her for any more ""therapy"" is simply impossible. Never, EVER talk to this incompetent, hateful chupacabra again. 

If you live in California, report her to the Medical Board of Quality Assurance. 

Meanwhile for YOU, find another therapist--a GENDER therapist. Make sure she's LGBTQIA+ friendly, and you can check if you do a  search on the Psychology Today therapist website. 

Let me assure you this person is totally full of shit. Believe NOTHING Shen told yiu. She wanted to hurt you , and it sounds like she succeeded. 

If you have specific questions about how you're dealing with your trans sensibilities, please DM me and I'll try to help--as a trans chick. whose dearest friend is a transmasculine person. 

But regardless: Never, EVER see this awful woman again...
Askjfskfjkl bro, you need to ditch that therapist (if you can even call her that) right away, she is blatantly violating everything a therapist is supposed to stand for, also report her if you can
Your therapist is filled with horseshit. She‚Äôs pushing her ideals onto you along with misinformation and is downright putting you down for wanting to feel comfortable in your own body in a way that‚Äôs non-conservative/traditional. I am so so sorry she traumatized you like that. I also suggest you stop seeing her as soon as possible, for your own safety. If you feel comfortable with doing so I‚Äôd also make sure other trans and or non-binary people give her any business before anyone else gets treated as poorly as you were. You are handsome. You are brave. Don‚Äôt let a shitty therapist get to you. üíô
Hey, dude, that therapist is full of bs, she's a bad person. I have trauma too, and trust me, it's better to be alone than with abusive people like your therapist. If you're going to school, talk to the counselor or any teacher you trust, they'll report to CPS. If you're not going to school you should call CPS yourself and no matter what, if you ever feel threathened, you ever feel someone is going to hurt you or someone did hurt you, you can call the emergency number.
You're right. She is on the wrong. I assume that she's cis, so she shouldn't be talking over trans voices. My advice: change your therapist
I would from now on just sit there in silence. This isn't therapy. She isn't doing her job. 
I believe it would be a win win situation. Parents get mad that you're not talking. Rafi fix up talk to a different one. If not then they are wasting their money, you get an hour's respite from them
Your therapist is unhinged and I'm unsure how they have a job
Listen, I read a lot of posts like this and think people are whiners (so mean, I know) but fucks sake, man, this isn't okay. This therapist is not going to work out for you. I have so much to say about this but I'm trying to be controlled here. *Do you have a way to switch therapists?*
Report her to some sort of union or education facillity
Report her - at minimum she won‚Äôt see you anymore
You did nothing wrong. This therapist is deeply misinformed in the best case. In the worst case this person tries to drive everyone back to their assigned gender at birth and doesn‚Äôt believe being trans is a valid state.

Please contact the licensing body she uses and report this behavior. She has hurt you, spread misinformation, and can do the same to others.
One thing you always have to remember: no one is infallible, just because she is therapist doesn't mean she can't be wrong about those things. Of course I don't mean ""trust no one"" but don't let yourself be blinded by titles either.
You are not in the wrong. She is full of shit and is a terf. I'm really sorry you had to deal with that. Reading the comments I understand that unfortunately you can't get a new therapist, which I'm really sorry because that sucks.
Ah you need to find a therapist who you can trust this person sounds sketchy! Very!
Therapist pushing their views on a patient? Fired.
refuse to speak with her, if you can‚Äôt find a new one and/or stop seeing her. she is a horrible person and shouldn‚Äôt be a therapist.
Please note that ‚ÄúChristian Therapy‚Äù/‚ÄúChristian Counseling‚Äù/‚ÄúReparative Therapy‚Äù for LGBT+ people is essentially Conversion Therapy without some of the more physical parts. The psychological traps, gaslighting, training you to not trust yourself, and training to abdicate your own sense of what is right to external authorities are still there. It is still psychological abuse.
Yeah she‚Äôs completely fucking nuts, and as a trans person in school for therapy she really should be losing her licence. It‚Äôs rock solid science that trans people who get affirming care and therapy have excellent outcomes, and that high suicide rate that psychopaths love throwing around is a number only found in trans people who are given the treatment you are. Stay strong and get a new therapist, she‚Äôs doing more harm than good.
She is only write on one thing and even then she is still wrong : when you will go on T or E it's possible that you experience mood swing, it's totally normal (just like before having period people have a change of mood because of T or when trans women have '' hormonal '' periode once a month)

Anyways, having drastic change of hormone *can* make you suicidal for a short period. It doesn't mean that you aren't trans or anything, it just mean that your body need a moment

I quickly see this in my psychology class so I may be wrong on some point ^ ^
Wow you need to get yourself a different therapist and if comfortable- report her ass!! This is blatantly bad, disingenuous, false, transphobic  info!!
This may be a case of ‚Äúno therapist at all is better than a therapist gaslighting you for your parents‚Äô entertainment‚Äù
I‚Äôm so sorry. I commented before reading (I know :/) but you are strong enough to tell either the school counselor, or call the state licensing board, if there‚Äôs any other adults around that accept you, tell them. This is an abuse tactic. I‚Äôm so angry for you ü§¨üò°ü§¨
I‚Äôd honestly say tell her that you won‚Äôt accept her treating you this way. You‚Äôre a man. She needs to treat you as such and that transphobia is a hate crime.
You are not in the wrong and you're definitely not powerless in this situation! I went through something similar with a psychiatrist last year and this is what I did. If you call or email the clinic that your therapist works for and tell them what happened, then you can report the therapist without having to talk to the therapist directly or involve your parents. I recommend an email because then you can include sources proving the therapist wrong and have a paper trail of how they respond. The YouTuber Jammidodger is a trans man who did his doctorate research on how medical transition lowers the risk of suicide in trans men who want it and he posted a video about it last year with the study linked in the description. The clinic should already have your insurance and payment information on file, so then you can switch therapists without your parents finding out. You deserve to have access to a good therapist. If you need immediate help, The Trevor Project has a phone number and an online chat service where you can talk to trans-friendly therapists for free.
Let us call her and shame her. That'd be fun.
I‚Äôm like. 90% sure that that is, at the very least, unethical, considering the overwhelming majority of the medical community, especially within the field of neurology, hasn‚Äôt recognized gender dysphoria as an illness or anything like that for at least 3 years, so practicing therapy and treating as though it were (which it‚Äôs arguable that‚Äôs what she‚Äôs doing cuz from what you‚Äôve said it doesn‚Äôt sound like she made any official clinical recommendations, but I think that‚Äôs absolutely what she‚Äôs doing) would be unethical at best. Definitely tell her to kick rocks and find someone who doesn‚Äôt suck at least. Sorry you‚Äôre going through that. I just got a new therapist and I‚Äôm sorta worried cuz I told her I wanted to start hormones and get top surgery as soon as is possible and she told me I should slow down, which I kinda get cuz the context is I‚Äôm starting life completely over again after a severe mental health crisis, but at the same time I told her how happy it will make me and how happy even just getting to dress how I want and learning how to do makeup has made me, so I‚Äôm not sure what exactly I should wait for and even tho I don‚Äôt think she meant it to be like that, it kinda *feels* like it, so I‚Äôm gonna feel it out over a few more sessions. But in your case definitely find a new one as soon as you can, if they‚Äôre refusing to recognize a fundamental part of who you are they aren‚Äôt going to be able to help you in any meaningful way.

ETA: just read your responses about not being able to get a new therapist. That‚Äôs fucked I‚Äôm sorry. Me personally I would just go to every session with headphones on and not say shit cuz whatever clinic your going to *will* drop you as a client basically immediately so at least you wouldn‚Äôt have to see her. However, if it‚Äôll cause serious issues with your parents that you don‚Äôt think you‚Äôd want to deal with until you can be free of their control, please don‚Äôt be like me lol.
Hun please don't preform surgery on yourself.
It... Is generally less safe, and I have at least heard (correct me if I'm wrong) that it could decrease your chances of getting help from medical professionals down the line. I think it's something to do with viewing it as the person being unstable or something.

That out of the way though...
Your therapist sounds like they have zero understanding or knowledge into trans people. 
Like, even if they don't specialize in it, it sounds more like their biases are interfering in their ability to actually help you.
To me it sounds like she shouldn‚Äôt be a therapist.
get rid of the therapist
The reason Michael Jackson got a rhinoplasty was because he suffered an injury prior. It was a corrective surgery. But he had not yet been diagnosed with lupus. This causes tissue destruction, which can be aggravated with surgery. But it was too late. 

I would like to point out that yes, plastic surgery is most of the time highly unnecessary. But in some cases, it is surely required for many trans people to have any hope in passing. I am in that bracket. While I personally do not need bottom surgery, I desperately need a rhinoplasty. Even as a guy I had a larger than average nose. 

In the case of SRS causing suicidal thoughts, this is actually true. But it's not for the reason people like to assume. When it is botched, it can lead to chronic pain. This is specifically because care for trans people overall is severely lacking. SRS is also still in its infancy. And naturally, we are not suicidal because of anything involving being trans, but rather because we are treated so horribly by society. 

For your particular situation regarding your therapist. She has crossed several lines. She is not a therapist. Their job is to listen to your problems and try to offer some form of guidance. The only thing close to betrayal would be disregarding this trust to protect you or others from harm (due to violent thought patterns). I didn't have to, but I tried to pick apart everything I knew moderately well regarding this quack.
Keep reporting her and let people know not to go to her. I hope you‚Äôll eventually be able to get a new therapist.
Least the therapist tried being polite. I typed up a 7 paragraph rant but meh not important. I'll just say at least your therapist didn't tell you to stop wasting time.

Whereas confirmation surgery/hormonal transition may help some trans people, oftentimes it is not the definite solution. It won't wash away your gender dysphoria completely, same way as cosmetic surgery won't solve body dysmorphia.

That being said, I would like if your T would have provided some evidence based study on the suicidal rates when transitioning, instead of using anecdotal data.

Also, rephrasing ""you will never be a man"" would be necessary. Surely she meant that your chromosomes will always be XX, therefore, you will be prone to women's health issues (autoimmunity diseases and such).

Regarding confirmation surgery, it is indeed cosmetic, you don't get a fully functional physiological twin penis or vagina, but it can serve the purpose of reducing gender dysphoria / body dysmorphia.

Overall, she doesn't seem to be able to help you. Either for being biased or ignorant on the topic. 

Your struggles and identity are valid and should be taken seriously and with care. That doesn't mean that transitioning should be taken lightly. Having a deeper look at transitioning and adjusting expectations are necessary imo.
Yea I wish I could get a new one but I can‚Äôt Bc my parents won‚Äôt let me. I‚Äôve posted about her multiple times Bc she‚Äôs just a mad therapist
This ""therapist"" sounds more like danger to you than helpful. So bad and wrong in so many places. Absolutely, gender confirmation intervention is life-saving. That's the global, medical opinion. Ignoring you? Then saying you're beautiful is pretty much misgendendering you. I don't think this woman is safe, or should be treating you. 
Perhaps you could write down (or copy/paste this thread) the stuff she's said to you, and also print out some information on the importance gender-affirming care and give it to your parents, asking for a new therapist. This woman sounds like she's trying to convert you, not help you. Danger signs all over. Good luck. X
Agreed new therapist wtf
And maybe worth filing a complaint against this one.
Well I used to be very unstable so I got sent to a hospital for that by my old counselor( I loved her) but my parents took me out Bc they called cps on my mom and they were supporting me and trying to help me.
I agree that no therapist at all would be better than this one. Is there any avenue school, out anyone else in your community where you can find a trans-informed therapist?
A way you do it is find their license number by searching it on the BBS (board of behavioral sciences) website. You can file a report there. Admittedly I'm only familiar with california law, but other states use the BBS.
therapy is largely unregulated so it is totally possible they don‚Äôt even have a license in the first place as there is no ‚Äúofficial qualification‚Äù you have to get to call yourself a ‚Äútherapist‚Äù
[removed]
It‚Äôs prob not illegal Bc I live in a VERY red state not a speck of blue lol
She‚Äôs is the only therapist near me( an hour away) that even mentioned that she is ok working with gay people
Exactly, people like this are why trans suicide rates are the way they are. They need to go.
Print out this article and bring it to your next session OP.  If the therapist will keep saying it with the facts in front of her, you‚Äôll know she‚Äôs willing to make stuff up to align with her beliefs
Yea I‚Äôve been trying to prepare to get out of my house since I was 14. It‚Äôs just a waiting game now
She once told me if I go back to a mental hospital that she would send me to the worst one she can find.
She‚Äôs the only person I have I can‚Äôt get another Bc parents :(
Thankyou that means a lot. And I never knew there were Christian therapists out  there. I guess I know why I wasn‚Äôt allowed to choose.
I don‚Äôt know her first name Angie?
That is absolutely appalling. We get that shit from friends, parents, co workers, classmates etc. NO ONE needs that from their therapist.
These people habe a way of piercing you with statements and questioning until you talk. 
This whole story is so abusive!
No that‚Äôs not really she told me plain as day that being trans is not real thing and like people who think they trans Bc they hate their bodies and it‚Äôs another psychological problem.
also, you are not even slightly in the wrong, you are a strong and brave young man who is doing what's right for himself, don't listen to a word of her bullshit.
Someone trying to hurt you and who's too cowardly to say that where other people can read it. Disregard them.
I am in the US
Thanks that means alot. I just wanted say that‚Äôs a big coincidence Bc I am planning to convert to Judaism when I am older!
No unfortunately not
I love Jammie!

Ugh, and I‚Äôm guessing your parents like her because her views align with theirs? Gods forbid a therapist do their job and be impartial and objective while still being warm enough to be approachable. Someone that can actually help you sort your thoughts and feelings instead of actively rallying against them to push their agenda.
She needs to be reported to the licensing board tbh. She is not only failing to do her job, but is actively working against her patient's interests.
Just stop actually talking to the therapist or get on a different topic and waste both your parents and your therapist‚Äôs time, and your parent‚Äôs money.
Honestly why go to therapy if the therapist doesn't want to help you apparently. Sounds like a huge waste of time and money
It's better to have no therapist than a therapist who will put you down, gaslight you, deny your experiences and make you feel worse! You can already get all that every other day of the week. She should be fined. This is not okay.
Sounds like your parents are trying to force you through conversion therapy.
I‚Äôm sorry you lost access to your old counselor. That is a really difficult situation to be in.
All the pieces are falling together perfectly in this puzzle. ~~How old are you and what state are you in hun?~~
Therapists in many places are ‚Äúmandatory reporters‚Äù. If there was cause for CPS to be called, your parents seem to have selected someone who will cover up what is going on and happily downplay anything you say.

Find an adult, possibly a school counselor, and talk to them.  They may be able to help you with reporting and getting you to a safer and more supporting situation.
I believe you can call CPS yourself, it's something to consider.
Nope closets therapist that has their names in their bio is 2 hours away :(
What country are we talking about here??
Unsure why we are playing devils advocate here but yes either way they would be pushing an agenda which is abusing their position of power over their patients. It‚Äôs irresponsible, unprofessional, and just plain gross. That situation is more than likely nonexistent tho as it‚Äôs usually the patient that brings up being trans and not the doctor. The doctor usually dissuades patients from thinking they‚Äôre  trans or forces them to prove it in some silly way
Whataboutism. Love to see it /s
1) we live in the future my friend! Distance is not an issue anymore, it's really easy to find an all online therapist, I might be able to point you in the right direction if you want. 

2) the color of your state doesn't really matter that much in this case, since this would be a part medical ethics/standard of care, which is determined by a board of professionals rather than by politicians. As far as I know, almost every state has a part of their ethical standards saying that a licensed practitioner can't give you A)blatant and provably false information, and B)can't say or do things that are ""clearly racist, homophobic, sexist, or otherwise overtly discriminatory.""

As well as the ethical standards, all licensed therapists/counsellors/psychiatrists/social workers are held to a ""standard of care."" That means they are expected to take what you say seriously  and respond in a way that lines up with medical consensus, and the reasonable person standard (would a reasonable person with their same education, license and skill level respond in the same way). 

And last thing, I don't say this to scare you or discourage you from actually talking to a therapist, but I just realized while typing this, you admitted to self harm/attempted self harm to them. From what you said it sounded like your therapists just kind of brushed passed that, which is massively illegal everywhere. Especially at the level of home surgery. they'd be, at the absolute minimum, required to talk about that with you and ensure that you weren't planning to do it again. If you're a minor they'd have to inform your parents and possibly CPS. Most decent therapists would have sent you to a Crisis center or dedicated mental health care facility. 

I'm sorry if this got a bit overwhelming or confusing, but even though I don't know you I am genuinely concerned for you, and concerned for any other gay/trans people that are seeing this therapist.
[this site](https://www.counseling.org/knowledge-center/licensure-requirements/state-professional-counselor-licensure-boards#) will help you find the contact info for your states licensing board. I hope things work out okay for you, and you can get real help.
Sounds like she's only ""ok working with gay people"" insofar as she thinks she can use her therapist's office as a form of conversion therapy, which is...super super super unethical.

I wish I knew if my therapist was taking new clients \[he's semi-retired\]...100% remote sessions so proximity isn't an issue, became ""the GSRM therapist"" locally entirely due to word of mouth, I've been with him for depression for years and was my first ally when my egg got launched out of a cannon...super supportive, put words to things I couldn't describe, etc.
I'd say this Sub-Reddit might be more beneficial to you than this therapist.
The statistic is totally misleading because it includes attempts pre transition (many do not attempt again after coming out), doesnt factor institutional gatekeeping and denial of trans health care, familial support, homelessness, co occuring smi, ptsd, discrimination, etc. Anybody with any scientific literacy knows this. There's no way a therapist is that wildly ignorant, it has to be purely malicious.
https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/political-minds/202201/the-evidence-trans-youth-gender-affirming-medical-care more studies just to tack on to the conversation.
And I hate it that it's that way for you. You should have parents that support you, or at the very least let you figure yourself out without getting in the way. Please don't mistake your hard won stability as her doing like she can take that away from you- YOU did that work, and quite likely in spite of her. Good on you- that had to have been hard.

If you can't not go to sessions,  look up the gray rock method- it's a super useful tool in the right situations, and this may be one of them. 

&#x200B;

Signed- Mom of a (trans) kid. 

&#x200B;

P.S. This is bullshit, you deserve better.
Thats so not okay. You should stop seeing her. I saw your other reply saying you cant get a new one but even so you really should stop seeing her. Shes causing more harm than good. If your parents are in control of your therapy tell them about her disregard for your safety and mental wellbeing. Tell them she says stuff that triggers you and she doesn't apologize or stop.
Threatening a client goes from ""bad at therapy"" to ""genuinely abusive and dangerous individual."" This really is the equivalent of going to a doctor who is poisoning you. You may need to go at it alone. But you have to get out.
That is really awful. A therapist using abusive threats like that should lose their license to practice. I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if she isn‚Äôt licensed and might be trying to use the ‚Äúreligious counseling‚Äù loopholes some places have.
Well no therapy is better than this.

You need to report this person as they are causing legitimate harm and will hurt others, regardless of what your parents say.

I know it's hard but you absolutely can do this. You are being abused and this may be your only way of ending that (for now at least).
Keep it in mind when you're listening to what she has to say from now on, ya know? Good therapy, REAL therapy is about helping you cope with life as it comes at you. She has an agenda beyond that, and because of that she's never going to give you the advice you need to hear.

Imagine you're locked in a room with a window. The glass itself is red, and as such when light comes in it casts everything in a sinister crimson. Everything you can see of the outside world bears this red hue, looking much more evil and sinister than it is on its own objective merit. Some day, you'll be able to leave the room. You'll be able to pick your own window: one that let's the flowers discard this imposed ombre in favor of their own natural beauty. You *will* be allowed to look through your own eyes, I promise you that. But there's no shame in backing away from the window for now. 

~

It seems that your parents are very unsupportive of your trans-ness. But if you're sneaky about it, there'll always be ways you can modify your gender presentation that'll fly right under their radar. Now I'm transfem so I wouldn't be the best person ever to ask about how to be masculine (lol) but I will offer the advice to get one of those hand-squeezy things that works out your forearms. They're a good little idle exercise to do throughout the day and it should be fairly easy to make the case that it's a fitness thing and not a gender thing.

If you find yourself forced away from the window, you can always find a crack in the walls through which to peer at your flowers üå∏ Your captors will be none the wiser.
Ahh, mine was Gwendolyn
Yea I once told her about a time my mom assualted me and she said it wasn‚Äôt that and I was being dramatic.
And adding to that as soon as I got outed I was sent to a religious school where pretty much everyday they preach people like me are going to hell.
Just DM OP, tbh this is going beyond therapist bad vent and into solid child abuse.
OP is probably 16 or so - they say they have 2 years remaining until they're a legal adult.
Yea it‚Äôs just I don‚Äôt have the balls to do that lol
Well specially the UK but it‚Äôs much the same in other countries (excluding the USA)
[removed]
Lmao it is tbh
Thankyou for the support. But Thankyou the most for supporting your kid. I wish I had a
Parent like you. You will never know how much of an impact that will have on your kid. I wish you and your kid the best of luck
Excuse me? I was upset before.. now I‚Äôm seething. How DARE she play the victim blame game as a THERAPIST. She needs to lose her job like last year.
You could report your therapist for breaking the law. OP, your therapist is required by law to report abuse. You should call CPS and tell them what is happening to you and that your therapist is enabling your abuse. Please be safe
ü§î report her to her professional body, once she's barred from practicing your parents will have to let you get a new therapist.

That's absurdly unprofessional behaviour.
Yea she needs to lose her job right this instant. If you bring it up to literally anyone that's higher on the board she'll have to go through examination and then she will promptly have her license revoked.
I think that talking to this person might be more harmful than not. Any chance you can just stop going or stonewall the whole time if you have to? Talk about music and the weather?
you need to report that therapist to get their license revoked
Um? That is a red flag. Therapists are not supposed to downplay stuff like that. They are supposed to listen and help you process stuff.
if you're being forced to go, go and be silent. A bad therapist can do a lot more damage than no therapy at all. Don't engage. Don't give her or your parents what they want. Be true to yourself, and get a different therapist as soon as you're able
You're right. I wanted to know because a lot of people are guessing suggestions based on not knowing OPs age or state and that makes giving advice difficult.

My blood is boiling reading this post, there is definitely some serious child abuse going on here by her parents and especially this ""therapist"". I'm not an expert so I will leave this to someone more qualified.
Links the federalist lol
No joke! There are knowledgeable people on here, who actually care about helping and supporting each other. üíôüíóü§çüíóüíô
Thank you. If you need some legit mothering or just a recipe for some cheap eats, send me a message. :)
Yea she‚Äôs all I have tho sadly:(
And?
Will do üëç
Tell every other employee you see at the clinic that you hate this therapist and need a new one. Tell them youre miserable. If you keep bringing it up something will be done, whether its for your benefit or for her reputation.
If she is licensed and stuff, I‚Äôm pretty sure there is a place to report them for this stuff ( forgot the name ). She might be able to lose her license over this.
Is bad therapy better than no therapy at that point though?
This is so funny actually. Where‚Äôs the helicopter joke. What else do you have??
And lol
[Not a great source.](https://mediabiasfactcheck.com/the-federalist/)
The post History is also red flag.
I can‚Äôt do that it took everything out of me to tell her I don‚Äôt like to be called beautiful. Sorry o couldn‚Äôt help
But without her I am stuck. One time I was having a serious crisis and my family took everything away from me. Like my phone. I couldn‚Äôt call no one for help. And my parents just dismissed me.
NO. NO NO NO. No therapy at all is better than bad therapy. Love, a therapy student. 

The relationship is EVERYTHING and it doesn't even matter how cool the shrink is if you don't trust them. Their job is NOT to judge you or impose their moral values. One of our tenets is Unconditional Positive Regard. The therapist is trouncing all of this by imposing her shitty, regressive beliefs. 

Refuse to go anymore, OP. Tell your parents that if they make you go, you just won't talk, so they're wasting their money.
Just about all the major media companies would fit under radical left, I don‚Äôt see why a change of pace would be a bad idea
Some of my posts were trolls, such as one about ‚Äúfatphobia‚Äù
Youre the only one that can help yourself right now. I know how hard it is to stand up for yourself but you need to raise a stink. Therapists like this are why people live miserable lives. Continuing treatment with this person will negatively affect you.

If you can't change people, you need to make your therapist aware that you will not listen to what she is saying. Never give in to her and make her job difficult. She may make the decision to find someone else for you.

Never give up on yourself. You know who you are, not this horrible stranger.
With a therapist like that, none is better. You need to stand up for yourself or nothing will get better. You need to report her.
She can‚Äôt help you. She‚Äôs clearly not in and way educated in transgender issues. She in fact is spouting transphobic rhetoric. This could be exactly why your parents chose her. Look her up, do research about her credentials and what issues she claims to cover.

If you can‚Äôt get rid of her, stonewall her. Say absolutely nothing of value during seasons. One word answers or no answers at all. 

The longest sentence You should say to her from now on is ‚ÄúI‚Äôve decided you aren‚Äôt qualified to help me, and any further dialogue with you would be harmful to my mental and emotional well being.‚Äù
OP, if you're comfortable DMing me her name and where you live, I am happy to report her. No pressure, and I can't guarantee it will change anything, but I'm more than happy to do it. You just say the word <3
I'm telling you, other adults at the clinic will help. Telling your parents will be dismissed and your therapist doesnt want all her clients bailing immediately (because shes abusive) so shes holding you captive. Tell anybody that you need help and that BOTH the therapist AND your parents are ignoring you. Something will happen eventually
I don‚Äôt know how old you are - if you‚Äôre still in school go and talk to a counselor there.

School counselors are mandatory reporters, and you‚Äôre being abused by your parents.

I‚Äôm sorry this is happening to you - you deserve far better.
With her you will only get worse though. You need help from someone willing to give it and she is obviously not it
The thing is, you don‚Äôt have that therapist either. She clearly is far more of a harm than a help. You are likely worse with her than without her
Im so sorry you‚Äôre in that situation. How old are you? How many years til you‚Äôre legally an adult? I hope you can get out ASAP
It's not the left/right bias that's important. It's the failed fact checks, promotion of conspiracy theories, and the fact that they were banned on Twitter for spreading COVID misinformation.

I don't doubt that it's okay for the occasional news outlet to be right-wing, because that's diversity of thought. What matters is whether or not they actually report on the truth, which The Federalist clearly doesn't.
Thanks I might do that but I am gonna tell my psychiatrist about this first and tell her what all my therapist has said and see if she can recommend me some therapists ( and hopefully talk my mom into letting me)
This - reach out to an adult you trust at the clinic or your school or call CPS and  them what is happening
Round 2 years :(
Great idea. Fight for yourself, you're worth it <3
So idk if this is possible for you and even if it is, it may not be the best choice depending on your situation. But after my mom told me to kill myself when I was 16, I ran away from home. I went to a hospital and when they tried to send me home I went to a friend and his mom took me to the police. The police took me to a group home. After a few days in the group home, my parents signed off on letting me move in with family friends. I never would‚Äôve thought they‚Äôd agree to that but they did. I never saw them again and it‚Äôs been 10 years, it will be 11 in May. Best choice I ever made."	sc0vek	trans	1015	0.99	2022-01-25 01:04:48
I think I may have a trans child	My child is 6 and wants to be a girl . He came to me and said this and I don‚Äôt know how to handle it. I want to support him but I don‚Äôt know how. Ik the world is cruel and I want to get him a therapist to support him mentally and help him learn to mentally navigate the cruelty ect . But I‚Äôm just not sure what to do is this to young to know ? I‚Äôm scared to let him dress feminine in public because I don‚Äôt want people to be billing him while he‚Äôs so young.Please help	"Definitely get a child therapist MAKE SURE they are not some christian conservative that is going to cause trauma and tell her to repress herself.  Definitely let her dress how she feels comfortable and be a good support system for her in ALL STUDIES the suicide rate for trans youth drastically decreases with affirmation and a good support system. The fact that you are here asking is a huge positive sign that shes in really good hands.
A child therapist is absolutely the way to go. 6 isn't too young to know. It's actually right on par for when gender identity forms.  

Right now, all gender affirming care would count as is letting them dress and present in whatever way is comfortable.   

My biggest recommendations are to make sure you're picking a therapist who is explicitly trans friendly (make sure they've worked with trans patients before) and to just be supportive and defend your child.   

You're right. This is a hard journey. But having the support of your loved ones makes all the difference in the world.  

You two can navigate this together and everything will be ok. üíñ
Follow your child and support them. Cis mom to a trans kid here. 

The world being shitty isnt your child‚Äôs issue. Your job is to help them navigate it.
So from what I read (for what that‚Äôs worth, sorry), this is a delicate but navigable experience. 

First, understand what he (and I use he just because that‚Äôs the pronoun you‚Äôre using), means by ‚Äúwants to be a girl.‚Äù In some cases, maybe even a lot, your child doesn‚Äôt quite understand what all that could mean. For example, he could be recognizing girls getting certain preferential treatment or maybe he found a girl‚Äôs toy particularly interesting but was told it wasn‚Äôt for him. I‚Äôm just spitballing, but your child saying ‚ÄúI want to be a girl‚Äù isn‚Äôt the end of the conversation, it‚Äôs the beginning. 

What I would do, if I were in your position, is let your child explore their gender as freely as they want. Let them wear whatever, refer to themselves as whatever, etc etc. Be very affirming. Talking with a specialist isn‚Äôt a bad idea, as they can guide you better into know if this a kind of gender dysphoria or just your child trying to express certain ideas in simplified ways. 

At some point, the topic of puberty blockers might come into play, but that will only be when your child is on the onset of puberty. That will buy them enough time before they would have decide if they want to go through natural puberty or induce an opposite sex puberty. 

But most important of all, love your child. If he is trans, let him, or her, or them, know that being trans doesn‚Äôt affect your love and don‚Äôt frame being trans as a curse or burden. The world can be cruel, but that‚Äôs all the more reason for any child to know that their parent and home is a safe refuge. Like all parents, your job is to give your child confidence, wisdom, prudence, courage, and hope.
Support your kid in the decision they make. Even if you think it‚Äôs a phase. Supporting a phase is better than denying a truth, and your kid WILL remember your choice
Your child is 6. Literally no one will take one look at them and know their assigned gender. Let them dress however they want.
There's a chance they'll reconsider and change their mind on their gender (even several times). I didn't. I was 6 when i first voiced the wish to be a girl and that never changed. There's literally no downside to being affirming right now.
The good news is anything you do at that age isn‚Äôt permanent, mostly just clothes, new name and pronouns. I was really young when I knew but never got support from family I‚Äôd definitely start with a lgbt friendly therapist.
Hi, i'm glad that you're supportive with your kid üòä i don't think it's to young to know, i knew i was a woman when i was 5-6 and it didn't changed. What you can do is find an lgbt friendly therapist to help you two on that path and then maybe buying some more feminine stuff ( like clothes, toys, etc ... ) to see how your child feels with them
I tried to come out to my parents at 4, and again at 6 or 7.

I'm not saying your child is definitely trans, but I do think you should allow them to explore that possibility in a supportive, loving way. That's what I wish I'd had, instead of a toxic home life that precluded the possibility of being anything other than a straight cis male. 

I lived the majority of my life unhappily, in the role I was assigned at birth.  A lot of dysphoria during puberty (which I was assured was just teenage angst and moodiness); never really fitting in as one of the guys but having to learn how to fake it; having unsatisfying  relationships where I was wholly attracted to all the girls I dated; becoming more and more depressed over time without even knowing why.

If I were in your shoes,  I would see a gender therapist who has experience with trans kids. And consider puberty blockers; they buy a struggling kid time to figure things out,  preventing any permanent changes (e.g., voice deepening, facial hair, body hair,  etc.). If you're worried about them being teased or bullied, I would first meet with the therapist,  then talk with the school's principal and your child's teacher. If they won't support your child, I would consider transferring to a school where they can start fresh, with people only knowing them as their preferred gender.
[Supporting and Caring for Transgender Children](https://hrc-prod-requests.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/files/documents/SupportingCaringforTransChildren.pdf) may be an awesome resource for you, as may r/cisparenttranskid. You are not going through this alone! So many other parents are navigating their children‚Äôs gender with compassion instead of repression nowadays. Thank you for reaching out to this community to find ways to support your child and help them thrive.
How would you feel about your child's revelation if you lived in a society where trans people were cherished and loved by everyone, and have been for centuries?

React in that manner and that is the world you will help create.
Totally agree on a child trans therapist preferably a female therapist from experience.  Until then there is no harm in letting your child explore herself as a girl and present herself at least at home like this. We had a friend fortunate enough to have a spare room that they decorated as a girl's room for their trans daughter and just let her choose what room and clothes she wanted to wear. They realized after 6 months that that was her new room and things progressed from there. It is great that you are hear talking to us because many of us have known our true selves since age 6 and before.  It can be extremely painful to suppress your identity and live as the gender you feel uncomfortable with. This is nothing but love from you trying to understand and support your child. For gender identity most of us have only found a respite in transition.
(I'm sticking with male pronouns for clarity's sake) I was questioning when I was about his age. One of my oldest, clearest memories is sitting at a cafeteria lunch table in the first grade 30 years ago wishing I could wear a dress and grow my hair out. I'm glad for him that he felt safe enough to tell you this, that means you're doing the right things as a parent. I didn't tell anyone because I was already bullied enough.

As far as potential bullying goes, I would hope his teachers are on top of things, but it might not be the worst idea to have him switch classrooms once he's ready to present as a girl- a fresh start, so to speak. I think a child therapist would be a good idea as well.
I can say as a teen, I wanted to be male when I was in first grade (6). I am trans, on hormones now, and am surrounded by supportive people. Don‚Äôt make fun of your kid, and let them wear and present however they want! It‚Äôll set them up to be a lot happier and comfortable in their own skin down the road.
Other people have given good advice but I just want to add that your kid will probably be bullied less than you might expect, especially in the younger years of school. Kids are very accepting, and they‚Äôre only becoming more accepting and well-informed with each passing generation. If your kid does get bullied, or god forbid a transphobic parent decides it‚Äôs somehow acceptable for them to express their bigotry, stand up for them and create an environment that‚Äôs accepting and loving and gives them room to grow and live.
6 is absolutely not too young to know. Let your kid know that you *hear* them and you take them *seriously* and you *support* them. That's the main thing.

six is too young for any kind of *medical* transitioning, though, but it's an absolutely great age to *socially* transition.

Kids that young don't really have the boy/girl/cooties thing yet, so shifting from a male presentation to a female one is probably not a big deal, especially if you can do it between school years or whatever. All your kid really needs is longer hair, different clothes, and to pick a name that suits them better.

Let your kid live the childhood *they* want to have. As a parent myself, I know how easy it is to get locked into dreams or expectations we have for our kids. But they are their own people, and one way or the other they're going to want to do things their own way. That's not up to us. The best we can do is love and support them.

If you're worried that this is ""just a phase"" or something, don't. Just let your kid explore it, and if it *is* a phase, it will pass.

And if it's *not* a phase, well, then you've given your kid the incredible gift of *more* time to be herself. You've given her irreplaceable childhood memories *as* her true self. You've shown her that you're a parent she can rely on no matter what. That's all to the good.

Especially about the memories. As someone who *didn't* know when I was six (took me until I was 45, but that's a whole other story), I look back on a lifetime of memories that I now understand are all *wrong.* Everything I've ever done, was done as the wrong version of myself, or was the wrong version of what I should have been doing.

Because at some point, kids *do* hit the boy/girl/cooties age. And when that happened, I was pushed away from the friends (girls) I'd had. I was forced to try to socialize with the boys, which was miserable, because I'm not a boy. I don't ""vibe"" like a boy. I don't ""speak boy"" like a native. I had to learn it as an exile, an immigrant, and the other boys could always tell that I had a ""girl"" accent. They couldn't place it, exactly, because the disguise I was born into is extremely convincing, but they could tell I had it. I was always ""other"" to them. So while I was forced to group with the boys, I was never *accepted* with the boys.

It was a recipe for misery, loneliness, ostracization, bullying, and the worst self-esteem you can imagine. DM me if you want more details. Happy to expand on that.

So if it turns out that you actually had a daughter with [a particular medical condition](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19955753) that only she can diagnose, and then please. I beg you. Let her have the girlhood she deserves. Let her have the socialization that fits her best. Don't exile her. Don't make her go through what I went through. Let her have the *right* childhood. This isn't something that can be fixed later. The wrongness of my childhood, the experiences that were denied to me, is a pain and a grief that will never go away.

I don't have anyone to blame for what happened to me. Nobody knew I was trans. *I* didn't know. And it was the '70s, so there's that. But by some miracle, your child knows themselves well enough to *tell you* that their life has a serious problem. They are reaching out to you for help.

Like I said, I'm a parent too. And the way I see it, parents have *one* job: to help their kids get the best start in life that they can. The question you face is how do you that? By supporting your kid in being who they say they are? Or by forcing them to be what you've always assumed they are?

Also: go listen to the [How to be a Girl](http://www.howtobeagirlpodcast.com/episodes-1) podcast. It's a few years old now, and it isn't being produced anymore, but it gives the parents' perspective on what you're going through and I think will be very valuable to you.
I‚Äôm proud of you for coming straight to the community and asking for advice Love and care for your child you now have a daughter let them experiment and let them be happyÔøº
Maybe start by using the pronouns that your child would like you to use
absolutely not too young to know. i would definitely invest in a therapist and maybe ask what they (your child) wants to be called. a good gender therapist will be able to give you resources and ways to help support your child dealing with the outside world. 

you‚Äôre a good parent for wanting to help always remember that. things can be hard when you have a trans child. a therapist for yourself that‚Äôs aware of care for trans kids could benefit you as well
I knew when I was 4 or 5 but had to repress it heavily and dissociate from my identity for my own safety. Your kid knows who they are.
First step in my mind: start by using your child‚Äôs correct pronouns, and make sure everyone in the immediate family does the same. It‚Äôs ok to feel scared, and your daughter doesn‚Äôt have to feel scared like how I did as a kid. Let her have some agency and freedom with clothing. Don‚Äôt get too caught up on gendered clothing, just let her wear what is comfortable. Love her no matter what, and always take her side.
I just want to echo things that are already pointed out. I‚Äôm almost 31 I came out a little over a year ago. I explicitly remember knowing I was trans when I was 5. I didn‚Äôt know the language but I knew ‚Äúi wanted to be a girl, I‚Äôm not a boy‚Äù. My parents were not supportive and frankly nobody was in the 90s. It took me another 2.5 decades and a lot of therapy to do it all finally. It‚Äôs been so hard, but it‚Äôs been the most rewarding and right choice I‚Äôve ever made. If I could have had a supportive environment when I was younger, everything would have been SO much easier. 

You‚Äôre on the right track, and it‚Äôs honestly really nice to hear. Getting a therapist that is friendly and affirming to trans people is the most important thing. As said earlier, at that age transition isn‚Äôt more than really letting them pick the ‚Äúgendered‚Äù things that feel the most right to them. It‚Äôs just the beginning of the discussion but it‚Äôs a really awesome thing to let them have that conversation rather than bottle it up for 30 years with bad coping mechanisms.

Good job. üè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
I knew I was trans at a young age btw
As a trans person myself, I knew earlier than that. Just support them.
Nothing to say that hasn't already been said, but ecstatic to hear you're supportive and came here for advice.
Well, I distinctly remember being 6 or 7 and staying awake at night thinking how much better my life would be if I was a girl, so yeah, your kid is definitely not to young to know that.

Now, I'm not saying your kid is trans, I have no way of knowing that, I'm saying kids that age can know they are, because \*I\* knew.

You should definitely take them to a therapist, just make sure that it's a good therapist -- I'm sure someone here can point you in the right direction.
Honestly just let them do whatever makes them comfortable. Don‚Äôt encourage or discourage them when they find clothes they like/want to wear. Also know that kids can mean a lot of things when they say stuff like this. Them saying they want to be a girl could mean they like more ‚Äúgirly‚Äù toys or clothes. Just let them choose what they like and how they like to present themselves, then go from there. A child therapist may also be helpful, but aim for a non religious one.
I think a therapist is great for this. I'm glad you want to be supportive no matter what. 

Sometimes kids know early on and sometimes they don't know till later in life. And well sometimes they may just experiment and then it's not even a thing.
It‚Äôs never too young to know. Be prepared to stand up for your daughter and get her a trans friendly therapist asap. She will face hardships but you‚Äôll have to be her first line of support. It‚Äôs important to educate yourself right now. Open the space for her to be who she is and let her dress however she wants. Allowing her the space to be herself will mean so much to your daughter. Don‚Äôt push back on what she wants so she can grow up knowing that she deserves, and has the absolute right to her bodily autonomy.
If you‚Äôre looking for a therapist for your child and are in the US, I recommend taking a look at https://www.psychologytoday.com/us - it‚Äôs how I found my therapist and she‚Äôs been really helpful. In addition to zip code, you can also filter for more specific qualities like ‚ÄúLGBTQ friendly‚Äù or ‚Äútrans-friendly‚Äù - I‚Äôd say these two qualities are a must-have. The more credentials, training, and other details on their profile, the better.
First off, you can be proud of your child for wanting to be themselves! You seem really supportive, just a little overwhelmed by it all which is very understandable!

  
People have already told you about this, but a trans supportive child therapist is your best bet at getting your child the help they need. 

They'll know how to navigate their feelings, inform you about how transcare for children works (just a quick fyi, this will not be anything medical until the child reaches puberty, which then there's the option for puberty blockers) and overall help you be a supportive parent. 

&#x200B;

I wish you the best of luck at being a supportive parent for a child who will grow up in today's harsh climate, but it's getting better around the world. Have a great day! <3
I was 3 when I knew and my older sister was between 3-5. A therapist for them would be a good start! At 6 the only form of transitioning there really is is letting them dress how they want and referring to them as whatever makes them happy!
Get them a child therapist who'd queer supportive and let them express themselves however they like. Completely reversible medical care doesn't start till 10-12, and the irreversible stuff starts at more like 16. At age 6, get them someone to talk to and let them experiment. If they wanna wear dresses, let them. If they wanna grow their hair out, let them. They're way too young to talk about medical options, so just let them play around. Maybe they try dresses and long hair and decide they're a boy after all. Maybe they try it and decide girl fits them better. Now is when they can play around without fear or consequences. Give them that space to play and support them whichever way they end up going.

Even if they don't end up being trans they'll have a better relationship with you for that support, and they'll likely grow up with more respect for women.
6 is not to young to know, some people it can take years but others including myself always knew. therapy is a good idea just make sure theyre not terfs. dressing fem at that young of an age would have been incredible to me and really that and using proper pronouns and maybe helping pick a new name are the biggest changes you can make right now. i tried for years as a kid to talk to my family about being trans and even begged to see a therapist but was just ignored so youre already doing better than some parents.
I love a supportive mom! Get a therapist if you can, and be sure to learn from trans people‚Äôs pov(as you are doing now). Kids before puberty are indistinguishable from each other gender wise, so I would say it‚Äôs probably safe and good for the kid to dress however they want.(with your discretion of course )
I was 6 when i told my mom i didn‚Äôt want to wear a dress or pink and purple anymore (love those colors as an adult now lol). We didn‚Äôt know what trans was back then so we had no words for anything. But she did let me choose what I wanted to wear and what colors. To have that support and freedom meant the world to me. I didn‚Äôt start medically transitioning until 17. I don‚Äôt see any need to rush into any drastic changes. Just allow them to express who they are through clothes and hairstyles. 
I personally really wouldn‚Äôt even rush into therapy this early unless they‚Äôre having negative thoughts and feeling depressed because of their assigned gender. I didn‚Äôt start getting very depressed over my assigned until around 13-14, but every child is different. The best thing you can do is support your child.
www.genderdysphoria.fyi
Is an *excellent* place to begin; it's high quality, comprehensive, and easy to read / understand.
I don't know how to help a young child. I am no therapist. however I can tell you care and want to help your kid. the world is terrible to us right now. you cannot change that. but you can make certain that your kid knows you love them. that you will be there for them. bad people exist already. and will hurt your kid at some point. you cannot help that. but if your kid is trans that won't go away. they will not be bullied less if they don't get to transition earlier. if anything if they transition medically as teenager they will be a lot safer as adult. they will look their prefered gender. they might have a rough decade ahaed but adult life will be safer for them, if they don't have to transition as adult. 

you are a great parent just being here asking. I know for sure that I didn't feel safe going to my parents saying such thing at that age and honestly I wasn't feeling safe saying that thing up until a week ago to my parents. i have completely social transition for over 2 years now and I talked to my parents about it a week ago. you are doing a good job already.
I'm not sure what advice I can give that hasn't been said already but I just want you to know that you are truly the best kind of parent. Thank you for being who you are, your child is so lucky to have you üíñ
Yep just go with a child therapist.  There are plenty of us who‚Äôve made the crossing to female from male.  That‚Äôs how i live my life.  Don‚Äôt be afraid.  Just embrace and support it.
Not to young at all. I knew I was from the moment I was cognitively aware where I can concretely remember memories so I was about 3 and a half almost 4, and I'm 28 now and my feelings have never faltered. Therapy can help for sure but just be supportive as you can if she wants to be a girl let her, and yea people are shitty just gotta care for your kid best you can
Well it could just be a phase is something most parents think but a lot of transgender people know they're trans from a young age for now I think you should just let him be free to explore but only around the house unless you think he'll understand the world can be a harsh place if he can understand that then I think let him decide if he wants to deal with it you're not exactly stopping him from experiencing it if you try to stop him because if he's intent on being a girl nothing will change that desire outside of his own free will so they will Ultimately experience it I think you should just try to teach him other people's opinions don't matter when it comes to his life also did you ask him what he wants concerning the topic he might not want to wear a dress everybody is different I personally don't like makeup but I love dresses and skirts I'm not big on shoes tho (also I just realized I was using he this entire time please don't hate on me for that I have a habit of using whatever pronouns I was introduced to if that makes sense)
the most wonderful part is that there‚Äôs nothing to decide, she already is a girl and she knows it! this world can be pretty awful, but fortunately young kids can be some of the most tolerant and understanding members of our society. most importantly, while some kids, but usually adults, can be unnecessarily cruel, the effects of preventing your child from living as herself will be truest horrendous, orders of magnitude worse than social ostracization. the immediate future will of course be somewhat awkward and difficult as you daughter grows her hair out and is reintroduced to her community as her true self, but beyond that her transition should be fairly seamless, depending of course on where you live. the day to day adversity that trans people face is usually based on strangers being able to identify them as trans based on their voice or body, which is something that your daughter will blessedly never have to face as she will never be forced to endure male puberty. she will always be trans which is a wonderful and beautiful thing to be celebrated, but she will have the privilege of choosing when and who she shares that with.
Definitely have them talk with a child therapist  
Maybe talk with your kid about puberty blockers, I MAJORLY regret not learning that I could prevent my puberty when I was that young.
i knew around this age myself, i definitely wouldnt concern yourself with any medical transitioning but dressing like a girl or more feminine hairstyles are a great first step. make sure ur kid is making the decisions about what steps they want to take and support them the best you can. bullying will come but i find at that age kids tend to be more accepting than later on. You'll always want to shield your kid from bullying but the reality is every kid gets bullies at some point, if its gonna be for something thats important to them and you can balance out the bullying with your support and maybe talking to some teacher ask them to keep an eye out for them. Most importantly i would say dont rush into anything, just let ur child tell you what they wanna wear and try to think about what you'd say if they were asking the same question and born female. Bullying is inevitable but will have little effect on a kid that knows they are loved and valued
I didn't know that young where I could verbalize it that was probably due to very very closed minded society and most family.  But I went my mother and grandmother knew I was somehow different and knew I liked to wear girls clothes etc etc we just didn't talk about it.  I definitely aligned myself to woman not men. So looking backI was definitely trans. 

So the issue with not being able to acknowledging anything was when puberty came my life became pure hell. School was a disaster because I didn't fit with other ""boys"" at all. Then came the teenage ways to cope. A primary one was alcohol because I could be more macho when I was drunk. This lead to other bad choices like drugs etc. So ~ 35 years later after having failed 2 marriages and basically failed life and then major legal troubles I figured it out. Better late then never I suppose It's amazing I didn't die during the fake hyper-masculine years..

And all of that simply for not being able to understand and no real help to understand what was happening when I was your child's age. If I could have worked thru it none of that trouble would have happened no doubt. ü•∫

So I tried to illustrate it's probably not something you as a parent want to look at as if it's a phase as many sadly do. It could be but If it is temporary she will know it before you do.. It's cool she can tell you. She just needs you to be her support help her understand herself and that she can tell you anything whatever.. Then all the bullying in the world won't matter and she can avoid the real trouble that comes from living a lie.. 

It's really so simple. I hope it all goes well for you and your family cool to see parent that cares like you do..ü§ó
It‚Äôs not too young to know. I started exploring my gender young too. Let them decide what‚Äôs write for them. Don‚Äôt try to decide for them cause that will only lead to more issues down the road like what I experienced. It basically ruined my life. And if they are trans, don‚Äôt let them go through a male puberty. It can destroy lives and lead to a lifetime of dysphoria and misery
I knew when I was 3.
Love your child.  Accept your child as she may be.  Let her explore herself in the safety of your home to start while you talk to a therapist.   Don‚Äôt force her either way let her find herself.  If you do that you should be fine.  There are support groups depending on where you live in the US that would be groups like PFLAG.  In the UK there are groups like Mermaids.  It may be a phase she grows out of but it might not be.   Show her love and acceptance either way.  

The most important part is not to tell her she‚Äôs wrong or that god hates it or anything like that.  I get being scared but I came out young to my mother and her response was ‚Äúthat‚Äôs the devil talking‚Äù I‚Äôm still working to heal from that today.  It‚Äôs nothing you want your child to go through.  

I know it‚Äôs a scary time.  The haters are loosing which is why it‚Äôs so tough right now.   There is a lot of love and support out there though.  Focus her on that.  There are good states in the US to live in if you are here.  Colorado in the Denver area has been fairly good to me.  We are protected in our state constitution and we are now getting trans members of the state government.  California I would suspect as a good place as well.  I can‚Äôt say much about the UK or any other country.  I don‚Äôt know what other states have good trans protections.  The more millennials and the next generations get into power I feel it will get better
r/cisparenttranskid could also be useful in this situation
The best advice I could give? Maybe Stop referring to things as ""boy things"" and ""girl things"" they're just objects. Don't gender them, dont push anything but offer to show everything you do on both sides IE shaving with dad, makeup with mom if they're interested. Let them wear what they want within reason. Some guys like makeup and fashion. Some girls like hunting and football. 

As a personal example. I have a relative who grew up very different to me but we were so freaking similar but she was more active and tomboyish for lack of a better term. I liked horses and color/art and gaming and yet I was the trans one haha. Life is weird like that.

Just trust them to tell you when things are right and always be open and communicate with them! You got this mama. 
You don't gotta change pronoun usage right now or treat your child differently. Just understand that one day your son may be your daughter. There may be a feeling of grief, if they are trans. but it will pass as you see the woman you raised.

Also, therapy is good for EVERYONE not just trans people. Don't let them push ANY agenda on them. Not religious. Not political. Let your kid gather their own opinions on these things just raise them to love and respect people and they'll be a good person and that's all you can do
Let them explore and express themselves. Be supportive and encouraging and find a qualified therapist. 

The world will be cruel either way. Can‚Äôt shield them from that. What you can do is give them a safe space in life.
I knew by the age of 6 that I wanted to be a girl but was too scared to tell my parents because I had a very ""boys do this"" upbringing and I'm 18 now and it's been torture ever since but the fact they've come to you and said this, is great!! Start off with a trans friendly child therapist and go from there, maybe start off with girly things at home and spend time with them and see what they want and if later down the line your child decides against it, great you have a son, if not great you have a daughter or if they decide to they identify a different way, great you still have a child, that loves you because you supported them no matter who they are or were. Love to see this kind of support, sending love to you and your child‚ô•Ô∏èü•∞
Here are a few things you need to know (this is coming from a trans adult that came out to their parents in their teen years):

‚Ä¢ It is perfectly normal to feel confused, uncomfortable, or even disturbed by this. This may seem natural to your child, but it's a big change for you, and it's okay to react that way: just try to make sure that this doesn't affect your child's self image. Don't make them feel like it's their fault, or like they shouldn't have told you: try to create a safe space where they can talk about this when ready.

‚Ä¢ Don't pry information out of your child. Sharing this is already very vulnerable. It's a lot better for them down the line if the initiative comes from them.

‚Ä¢ One of your first thoughts may be that they've been influenced by something (people usually think of social media, the internet, or TV): just know that that's very unlikely, especially at this age.

‚Ä¢ Absolutely do get them a child therapist, but PLEASE make sure that they're safe. Unfortunately medical professionals are not well informed about transgender people (especially transgender children) nowadays, so you need to be careful. Look into resources online from LGBTQ activist groups, they may have good insight on what practitioners near you are considered safe.

‚Ä¢ If you live in the US, some may suggest that you send your child to a wilderness camp, or some other camp based on ""wilderness therapy"". Please DO NOT DO IT. There are enough testimonies from kids who were put in these to know how horrible they are. It doesn't ""cure"" anything, all it does is traumatise your child into mindless obedience.

‚Ä¢ It's okay if it turns out to be a phase! Gender exploration is normal for children, just like any other part of their identity. Even if in a few years they go back to presenting as a boy, please support them all the way through regardless of how long you think it's going to last. It may last their whole life!

‚Ä¢ The world is very mean to trans kids. It's good to have your child be prepared to face bullies (kids AND adults). Teach them that if something makes them happy and doesn't hurt anyone, no one can tell them it's wrong. Be prepared to defend them when needed.
Even if she keeps presenting as a boy, overtime she will inevitably show gender non comforming behavior, which people also discriminate against.
I knew when I was 6, it's definitely not too young to know. Good job on not ignoring that and not pretending it's not happening.

Society can be cruel, so it's great that's the first thing you think about. Like the others said, a good therapist would be a great step, to help your kid deal with that later on.

Still, the best thing you can do is support (him/her). At that age, you're still (his/her) whole world. If you stand up for (him/her), that means so much more than anything a stranger could ever do.
6 is young, grow the hair out and stuff and no one. They can be free for a little way at least. My 3 year old wants to wear feminine clothes. Probably just playing dress up, I let both of my kids wear or play with whatever they want. Things will be what they will be. You just have to support them.
> is this to young to know ?

Definitely not - that's when I found out about myself (and I have even earlier memories of being sad about my anatomy compared to my sister's).

Oh and yes: the world is indeed a cruel place, and not only for us trans peeps - try being disabled, autistic, or ""different"" in just any way and you'll find out how nice, empathetic and compassionate most people really are (which is: dramatically close to zero) :-/
First off, where do you live? Your decisions need to be based on that. If you are in a red state or a transphobic country, you need to figure out how to affirm your child‚Äôs choices at home while keeping them safe outside the home. If you are in a more accepting place, then allow them more freedom to explore.
First of all, accept that you now have a daughter. Call her ""she"". Ask if she wants to be called a different name. If so, help her pick one. Then take her shopping and let her pick some new clothes. Let her hair grow out and style it. And in the meantime, you can either get her some hair extensions from a salon or just some cute beanies to wear.
If your just bringing your kid into the store, it wouldn‚Äôt really matter if they‚Äôre wearing ‚Äúboy‚Äù or ‚Äúgirl‚Äù clothes. At that age, there is nothing that would clock (when someone finds out you‚Äôre trans) them, there isn‚Äôt any difference besides genitals at that age. I wouldn‚Äôt worry about that, at school I‚Äôd be more careful though.  Also depending on where you live, I‚Äôd suggest getting familiar with your local laws to see how where you live treats trans people. If your child is firm that they are trans as their gender identity (which people can totally know at this age!) then honestly I‚Äôd seriously consider changing schools if their current school isn‚Äôt okay with them being who they are or protecting them. Also you should check out r/cisparenttranskid
Pflag has a lot of resources for parents
When I was 5 or 6, I asked my mom when she would teach me to use makeup.
That fact that you are asking and supporting and learning is everything. It might be hard for you child to understand the feelings they have but I'd say start small. Let them try out feminine clothes and make up and if they don't want to go out like that yet it's fine. But if the want to see what it feels like for other people to see them like that that's also OK I think. I understand the fear of bullying...I was bullied a lot....so I'd start with educating them on that. People hate anything different and I would hate to have them not be who they are because they tried to dress the way they want and got hurt. 

P.S I used they since it seems like he might not fit and she is a bit tentative. 

The Mos important part is to love them and educate them and they will be grateful no matter what they decide to choose.
I think the most important thing to remember is not to encourage them one way or the other. 6 year olds say a lot of crazy shit and I contrary to the mainstream narrative I don‚Äôt think you should instantly affirm and start transitioning your child. Let them play with whatever toys or have whatever clothes they want to wear, but I would just leave it be and see how your child develops. If they are persistent then think about seeing a professional.
Do you understand French? On instagram there is this account: @eleonore.et.nous , it's a wonderful mom (I say this as a trans person) of a wonderful trans little girl and she shares their story and I think that it can be really helpful for you and your child. 
And if they really wants it, please don't stop them from being a girl, it would just hurt her a lot.
100% to young to know if u ask me
[removed]
thank you for being supportive of your kid! 6 is absolutely not too young to know. it‚Äôs fairly well-documented that kids develop a sense of self and gender identity around 3-5, so the fact that your kiddo can recognize this and find the words to tell you is both cool as hell and developmentally appropriate. let her be herself as far as exploring clothes, interests, etc., and find a therapist who has experience with trans kids. neither you nor your kiddo are alone, here
first and foremost: you‚Äôre already doing better than most parents by asking for help. you‚Äôre showing a huge amount of love and respect for your kid by reaching out about it, and i want to thank you for that.

a child therapist is a fantastic idea, especially to just help your child navigate the cruelty of other people and how they personally see their identity

as far as dressing feminine, let your kiddo try it at home first. get them some dresses, some more feminine clothes, just to play dress up with and see if they like it. you can always cross the ‚Äúin public‚Äù bridge later, now all you can do is support your kid and help them explore their gender

you can also ask them if they have something else they‚Äôd like to be called, and help them pick out a name they like to use just among close family and friends

again, you‚Äôre doing a great job. just WANTING to help your kid and be supportive is a huge step in the right direction üíú
I knew by this age.  Get the therapy going and start working rom there. I really wouldn‚Äôt go much further without that basis.  Make sure you take care of yourself as well.  Keeping the whole family mentally healthy will be best for everyone.
Let her dress in girls clothes in public. She‚Äôs 6, and therefore looks exactly like a cis girl would. Only you will notice. When she‚Äôs older, hormone therapy will be necessary, but that doesn‚Äôt matter rn.

I would give anything to have come out at 6. It can‚Äôt hurt a kid that young to help them transition. It can really fuck them up for life (and even kill them) to do anything else.

Also, she doesn‚Äôt want to be a girl. She wants to not have to pretend she isn‚Äôt a girl.
I ""knew,"" I was trans around that age also. But, it was 1984 when I was 6 and we just did not have the language for it, except for the insults like, ""fag, ""pussy,"" etc. I knew who I was but there was no word for me...I chose a lifetime of masking and overcompensating, self harm and self hate, in order to protect myself from the bullies. I also started stabbing myself until I bled, around that age. I secretly danced to Whitney Houston. I wore my mom's clothes in secret.

Unless you would doubt a cis/straight kid knows who they are at 6 why would you doubt a trans/queer one?

Therapy, be supportive, and just love them to pieces. You are already taking the right step by asking the community questions.

Scary, yes, but also beautiful. Big hugs!
her
Ask them what they mean by that. To children that young being a girl might mean wearing feminine clothes, having long hair, or not playing sports. And if that‚Äôs the case that doesn‚Äôt necessarily mean they‚Äôre trans. I don‚Äôt think they really understand what that means
Before puberty all kids look the same anyway
Six and knowing isn‚Äôt uncommon.  Take your child to a therapist and work with the therapist.  That‚Äôs the best way to go about it.  

As for letting your child dress feminine, now‚Äôs the age to let them.  If your child decides he isn‚Äôt trans after all it‚Äôll just be a quirky phase as a kid.  

Kids around your child‚Äôs are usually more accepting of things.  If your kid is legit trans the kids around her will have had time to think that‚Äôs normal for her by time they reach the age where the potential bullies become  little monsters.
It's definitely not too young to know. Chances are they aren't completely sure yet but so far I have never heard about someone who said these kinds of things that young and didn't turn out being trans.

Visiting a therapist is a good idea and a very crucial first step regardless of the result. Just make sure it's a decent one that supports trans people. Check for local trans communities to find out which are okay and which to avoid.

Aside from that ... just be supportive. If they want to be called she/her then do it, if they want to be called a different name then do that as well. It doesn't hurt anybody even if (and that's a big if) they someday decide it doesn't fit them after all.

As for bullying, honestly there's not much you can do to avoid it if it happens. It's one of those few things where adults can be completely powerless and trying to intervene usually just makes it worse even. All we can do is to be there for them at home.

&#x200B;

IF things turn out to be the case that they're trans then consider testosterone blockers starting in a few years. They don't harm your child at all, they just delay male puberty. And while male puberty is perfectly fine and desirable for boys, it's something incredibly harmful for girls as it changes things they can't fix via HRT as adult (beard growth which would then require expensive and painful treatment to get rid of, voice break which then requires super difficult voice training, hip fusing which isn't fixable at all, and other bone structure changes like bigger hands, broader shoulders and chest etc. which also aren't fixable at all) which puts a huge mental strain on them.
Definitely get a child therapist, one that is specialized in trans kids or has had trans patients. That‚Äôs very very important.

Let your kid explore, get them a dress, let them grow their hair, etc. They‚Äôre at the age that most of us start to develop our ideas of gender identity. When I was that age, I knew I didn‚Äôt fit with what I saw as a girl, but didn‚Äôt know how to express it. Your kid is letting you know, be their biggest supporter!! I can tell that you‚Äôre gonna be a big support for them, coming here and asking is a great idea. Many happy wishes for you and your kiddo üíô
As a trans woman, I would suggest letting them dress in a more feminine way and let time tell if it's a faze. I would also suggest bringing them to a therapy and possibly an after school suppot group at your nearest pride center.
Truthfully at that age is when it will be the least noticeable to people that someone is trans. Little kids pass really well as any gender when presenting with the associated appearance. If your child currently has a short haircut and starts to dress more ‚Äúgirly‚Äù people will notice but it‚Äôs becoming relatively common to give kids more freedom in their clothing and toy choices. As others are saying, the kindest thing you can do is let your kiddo explore what they like and how they feel and as they get older what their permanent desires for themselves are will become more clear. Thanks for being a good parent. Mine weren‚Äôt bad but they just didn‚Äôt do anything. I told my mom I wanted to be a boy when I was three and she asked why but that was it üòÜ I continued being given girls clothes and toys and honestly forgot I even told her anything. If I asked for something from the boys section I could have it but I think I would have benefit a lot from a better conversation. In the early years for a trans kid the main thing they notice is what boys and girls are given so it can be as easy as talking about what kinds of toys and clothes and shoes they like or if they want to be called a girl or a boy
Let him grow up n be trans if he want. Jus protect him from the ppl n outside things u want to
The lovely thing is that at that age they don‚Äôt look like a particular gender unless they‚Äôre dressed to. I‚Äôd go with it, and adapt your approach to fit whatever is going on. The important thing is to always respect their theirness, so they know they can come to you with problems, questions, etc.   Admit if you‚Äôre needing to do research to find out stuff you don‚Äôt know for them, so they realise their questions are worth asking.
Everyone is different, but I knew at around 2 well before I had any language to describe how I was feeling. Seek a therapist, definitely.
Start by reading That‚Äôs Gender Dysphoria and The Gender Dysphoria Bible. Just search for that. 

Six isn‚Äôt ‚Äútoo young.‚Äù I had a feeling about it when I was four, but didn‚Äôt have the words to express it (it was also the early 80s). You can help by using preferred pronouns, talking to her, asking how she feels, and what she wants to do. A therapist specializing in gender dysphoria is an excellent way to help. The worst that can happen is that she decides down the line that being a boy would be better, but at least she was given the freedom to try.

You want to be supportive, and this is a challenging subject for anyone. You are a good parent by wanting to be supportive, and that is leaps and bounds more than many of us ever get. You‚Äôll do just fine.
As someone who knew super young, it‚Äôs definitely a good idea to have them talk to a child psychologist. It‚Äôs most important that your child knows that you‚Äôre supportive and will continue to love them. If they want to dress more feminine in public, let them, and make sure to back them up if they get any flack from anyone. Nothing‚Äôs permanent about any of this, so there‚Äôs not a ton to worry about in terms of your child being too young. You‚Äôre still a good way out from any sort of medical intervention being necessary, if your kid wants that eventually.

When it comes to bullying, it really sucks, but at least from my experience, it‚Äôs better to be able to openly express yourself and get some flack from the outside world but come home to a supportive family than to feel like you need to present a different way because family members are too concerned about you getting bullied. It‚Äôs really understandable and very good that you want to protect your child from bullying, but feeling like they‚Äôre being supported by you is really the most important thing.

I‚Äôm glad you‚Äôre looking for information and trying to figure out the best course of action, it‚Äôs wonderful to see parents wanting to support their trans and questioning children.
You are never too young or old to discover your identity.
The best form of support that you can give him is to show him that he is in a safe place with you, that you will accept him, accept his identity and his expression.
And the same talk with her about her aesthetic expression (feminine, masculine, etc.) does not define her identity, nor vice versa, that is, she can be a girl and have a masculine expression, be a boy and have a feminine expression, etc.  
At this age it is not necessary for them to be overwhelmed by knowing their identity, since it is still developing and there may be changes in their process, but it helps them to know their comfort pronouns, they can, for example, try the pronoun 'she' for a while (a week or so), see if you feel comfortable, then the pronoun 'he' and so on.
[written with a translator, forgive any grammatical errors if there are any]
I‚Äôm the mamma of a now 8 year old trans girl who transitioned at 4. She knew who she was as soon as she could articulate gender.

It‚Äôs incredibly scary at first but focus on what your child is telling you, love them unconditionally and pave the way for strong relationship with you. Your trans child is a gift. You can do it!
Children are children, they will express themselves however they want to, just give your child options and let them know that they have your support, knowing that your parents won't reject you is really powerful, the confidence that they'll get from that will let them weather how others might treat them.
I‚Äôm gonna say what everyone else said but get a child therapist that has worked with transgender people before 

and let them dress feminine to see if they feel more comfortable that way. making sure they feel supported is very important with young transgender children (as it is with almost every human but yknow) 

and I‚Äôm so glad she has a parent that would ask this subreddit for help on what to do keep it up <3
Get her a therapist ASAP, she knows the same way you knew you weren't trans since a very young age.  How does she know she is in the wong body? Our gender is actually the result of our brain's layout. Other kids won't care que your child's gender switch, all the negativity comes from the adults, plus she is SO YOUNG! Hopefully you don't live in one of these fascist anti lgbt retrograde states and you can get the help your child needs.
To all the supportive parents here, you're all great. Please adopt me. That is all.

I can understand that this is a scary situation for a any parent, who loves their child and wants to protect them from the judgement of others. 

I am very glad that you take your child serious and don‚Äôt dismiss them, and that you‚Äôre asking for help here. Maybe sit down with your child and ask them to explain to you how they feel and how you can help them. Make some suggestions too. Be there for them and make sure that they know that what they feel is not something to be ashamed of. 
It‚Äôs already a great sign that they told you - they trust you! 

In the meantime, looking for a trans friendly therapist is definitely the right way to go! 

You also need a support system for yourself and look after yourself too, so you can be strong and helpful to your child. 

Take care :)
Move to NYC...
children say stuff they don't mean all the time, the best thing you can do right now is ... nothing. let your son find his own path by his own terms, don't enforce anything otherwise you will make a mess out of yourself and the child.
Thank you for asking on a trans subreddit. I've seen people ask on general advice ones and yet terrible advice
Hello there, first of all its so good that your asking questions, its okay to have them and just the fact that your worying is so good. A child therapysit is defenetly a good options, not only for trans kids but chidlren in generall, it will help then prosses theyre feelings and be able to cope better. I think even if its ""just a phase"" (its probably not) letting your kid express themselves will be good either way. Leting them wear ""girl clothes"" will probably make your child more confident and it will alow them to learn more about theselves. The world is harsh indeed but suprseeing you child's emotions because of it wod cause more harm than the world could. You just have to make sure to suport them tru it all. Your a great parent and your dooing great. :)
i knew when i was four. it‚Äôs not a feeling that goes away
Get them a child therapist to help them and take them shopping for clothes that they want, just be there and support them ofc you don‚Äôt need to have them dress too demons if where you live is really conservative or you suspect it would be unsafe for them but just let them know if they want to be a girl than they are a girl and worst that could happen is they decide they aren‚Äôt and you have to take them shopping again (not a parent but a trans child so it‚Äôs not perfect but probably a different perspective than a lot of other comments here)
my little siblings are five and sometimes they say that they're not a boy/girl (they're boy/girl twins) to get an angry reaction from my parents because they think im a bad influence on them. was it a serious thing that your child has thought about for awhile or just a whim? both should be supported of course, but therapy is expensive and i don't know if a 6 year old would really get it. i think the best thing you can do for them right now is to just affirm them in however they feel and to not force labels on them because what if they're just exploring? what if they're using feeling like a girl in the not feeling like a boy sense and they're actually genderqueer? id say keep the status quo for now and tell them you're gonna support him in any decision they make, and if they decide to change something then go with it. i wish you both luck, thanks for being such a supportive parent!!
Let them dress feminine ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è not sure how old they are, but kids pass fairly easy. Give them a taste of it. Your job to to make them happy, not control how others treat them
Look up Debi Jackson.  She's on FB and other social media sites and started her own organization called Gender Inc.  She's an outspoken advocate of transkids, having one of her own.  Debi is great, enlightened, helpful and a real bulldog.

It‚Äôs important to also not put any labels on them and use the pronouns they want you to use. Go at their pace
>Right now, all gender affirming care would count as is letting them dress and present in whatever way is comfortable.

biggest takeaway for this kind of discussion IMO. It is ok to relax: your child isn't going to become a changeling or anything! There's so much fear around trans children these days but it really comes down to a shift in perspective and, yes, letting a kid be a kid!
^^ 100% this! ^^

At 6, all you need to do is let them pick out their own clothes. Let them express themselves. Let them go by a nickname if they want. Get them to a good therapist. And back them up. Even though there are kids (like myself) who know they are trans at an early age, its still important to have them go to a therapist so they can get the right vocabulary to communicate what they're feeling. And also to avoid the occasional false positive. Because sometimes it could be as deepseated as being trans. Sometimes its a service level as ""girls get to do X thing, but if I try to do X thing, I get made fun of because 'that's for girls'. So I wanna be a girl so I can do X thing."" That was how my sister felt about a lot of things growing up. She liked a lot of ""boy-ish"" things. And people would make fun of her for it. She wasn't trans, but she would say things like ""I wish I was a boy so I could do X without people making fun of me.""
Absolutely Chloe and you have some excellent and thoughtful points.
Perfect answer, nothing to add as far as I'm concerned.
>The world being shitty isnt your child‚Äôs issue. Your job is to help them navigate it.

This right here. I'm a trans parent to neurodiverse kids, at least one of whom is queer. 

The secret is, you parent them exactly how you would have if they'd been what you expected (I guess? mine blew my expectations before they were born so I stopped trying to predict anything), only harder: follow them harder, support them harder, love them harder, help them navigate the world harder.

Doing that hard work will make you proud, and seeing you proud will make them proud of themselves. They'll grow up knowing their worth.
Man, I wish someone would tell my mom this. She just keeps saying that if I pretend to be cis and straight, I won‚Äôt have to worry about discrimination. *Thanks,* mom, that‚Äôs *so* supportive. Real victim blamey attitude.
This is the comment. Being trans is a big diagnosis and you need to figure this out. The methods we have aren't perfect, but its worth pauses and thoughts.
As a parent of two small children I assure you that many people will look at them and think they know their assigned gender. 

The rest of this I fully endorse. 

I told my dad a couple of times I wanted to be a boy, and he let me. Each time it stuck for about a week and then I called it off, because I didn‚Äôt like not being recognized as a girl, even though when I was a girl I didn‚Äôt like being thought of as only a girl. When I grew up and learned gender wasn‚Äôt actually binary and it was possible to be both, it was like ‚Äòohhhhhh, yeah, that‚Äôs the one‚Äô. 

Some people‚Äôs gender does change over their life, absolutely, but experimentation is as much about finding out what doesn‚Äôt work as it is finding what does.
Yea I second this cause I tried to come out 6 times but all denied which lead to the same problems. I hate it but it can probably get better so to OP. Yea the child needs support and love let them be their self and don‚Äôt let them suffer dysphoria.
Love this

Also, truth.
This is a great podcast, commenting to save
This website helped me. I highly recommend it.
This right here. Safety is the first most important thing, and making sure your child feels seen, heard, and validated
I live in Memphis tn
Why do you say this
The bonafide, *credible* medical science is now established that one's self-identified gender is set in place by/between age 2-3 for the vast majority of people.

The same *might not be expressed* because of familial, social and/or religious indoctrination; regardless, children do in fact know internally whether they are a boy or a girl, regardless of genitals (sex). Whether they feel *safe* enough to admit to it is another story entirely.

Sex change surgery is almost never provided until age 18, excepting for Intersex children. Intersex... is not... the same as Transgender.

Puberty Blockers are often given just as puberty begins. These are 100% reversable, with zero negative effects. 

There are quite a lot of Myths / false & highly inaccurate information which circulate on Facebook & other social media.

I would encourage you to visit PubMed, the search engine for The National Institute of Health, for bonafide, Real information from credible researchers.
Yeah I agree maybe using gender neutral pronouns is a good idea for right now.
I wish I could have become a changeling at 6 tho, that'd be neat
Yes let kids be kids, just make sure they know that they can talk to you and have good communication with you and all will be fine
I'mma be a neurodiverse trans mother wish me luck XD
Same! My mum's also like that, sending you lots of love and support from my dad though
[removed]
God my mom has this attitude whenever I call out a relative for queerphobic shit. She‚Äôs also worried that my younger sibling is gay (they‚Äôre bi) even though she‚Äôs ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù all because she doesn‚Äôt want to upset my extremely bigoted Christian grandma.
You aren‚Äôt diagnosed as being trans or cis, it‚Äôs not like it‚Äôs a mental condition.
Diagnosis?
Actually the methods to diagnose are near 100% accurate I'm pretty sure. And 97% of trans people keep transitioning, of the 3% who detransition many do it out of safety to go back in the closet our of fear, there's also a large part of the 3% who want to go a different route through their transition or found a identity that better fits them, and only a minority of the percentage is people who actually got it wrong and detransition. <From latest studies about us and such.
I feel bad you got downvoted I feel you had good intentions and just worded your thoughts poorly and everybody is hating on you because of it
For what it‚Äôs worth, I appreciate the sentiment you left on my comment. I am totally surprised you‚Äôre getting downvoted. ‚ÄúDiagnosis‚Äù is an appropriate term and while I would never say you need gender dysphoria to be trans‚Ä¶ a lot of trans people do have gender dysphoria. You, or a specialists, do diagnose it.

Especially since we‚Äôre talking about a kid here. There is a fair chance that his feelings aren‚Äôt necessarily feelings of distress or euphoria, but it‚Äôs worth to take what he says seriously.
Apparently when I was a young kid some acquaintance thought I was a girl due to me having long hair for a kid, and my dad was so mad about it he had my hair cut the same day

I feel like the parents themselves are often the ones obsessing the most with their kids gender presentation, and that translates into projecting those expectations into other families
I‚Äôm not sure how that is, I suggest researching and asking your local lgbtq community what the status is
Hah. You've clearly never parented a 6 yo changeling before.
As a changing I‚Äôm gonna tell you it‚Äôs not a cake walk it‚Äôs really confusing and the older you get the more distant you get with your family regardless how close they get and trying to explain your own birth better then your own mother remembers‚Ä¶ It‚Äôs just awkward
Nobody better for the job!
Im so sorry your moms aren‚Äôt ferociously out there being your biggest advocate and cheering squad. I don‚Äôt understand it, just know that there are moms like me that will love and support you in the world no matter if we had you or not. 

Your true self is valid and beautiful. Remember there is a whole world out. Your moms are missing out and that isnt your fault its hers.
Yeah, I kinda fucked up
disgnosed for being too cool
Looking at it from a medical standpoint.
Yeah, HRT and SRS are life changing things. I want people to be able to figure out what they need properly. And for all the trans women and men here In glad that treatment helps, I hope just to keep in your heads that it isn't the treatment for everyone and we need to use and improve diagnosis and treatment of gender dysphoria. - A lover of science and medicine.
With 6years old i had P.E. and i took of my shirt because i could always do this before. And my teacher was shocked and told me to cover up and i didnt understand because there were so many boys without shirt. 

That was the first time i felt like i was not the same as the boys :(
no, I haven't, can you explain the difficulty with parenting a fairy in place of your child?
Thanks lol I just hope my child isn't as bad as I was lol
Thats like saying you are diagnosed with gay. A diagnosis would be something like gender dysphoria
Apparently I'm joining your downvote train for agreeing with most of what you said here I guess people think hrt isn't a good thing or something
Yeah
Given that neurodivergent people are believed to be the origin of the changeling myth, my mom would say it's not so bad.
Technically it wouldn‚Äôt always be a fairy. The idea was that your baby would be swapped or by an elder fairy who can‚Äôt take care oftemselves anymore or a rock or stick that looks like your child (cause fairies love to fuck with humans.) either way it has been found that these ‚Äúchangeling‚Äù children where often just autistic/ disabled,‚Ä¶ which is kinda horrifying seeing what people would do when they thought their child was a changeling‚Ä¶
I‚Äôm Fae but not a Faerie folk im a shadow-kin a child of Anpu (Anubis) Talking too soon extremely smart and really dumb about human stuff‚Ä¶ Not athletic but uncannily good at combat sports, great at art but fails art class, empathetic and tarot cards do weird Shit imo most trans folx just jumped in the wrong bodies
This was how I figured out I was bi. Doctor said ""you have gay""
That's more of what I was going for, actually.
I'm definitely diagnosed with gay
I have a dnd character based off this concept, he‚Äôs an autistic changeling

Small edit: I feel I should clarify that I‚Äôm neurodivergent
y-you're saying I'm already a changeling?
I'm a living nightmare for my parents
Yikes, I forget that people actually believed this stuff!
I'd love that tbh xD /j
I like your style that is almost the same thing as my end character who's the same but a shapeshifter. Aka basically the same

Welp üôÉ While there's been so much legislation introduced recently attacking trans existence, this is one of the most directly harmful ones yet to fully be passed into law (hopefully it gets blocked by the courts)		"This won't get blocked by the courts. It's Utah, this is Mormon Town and Mormons *hate* trans people
Remember when this happened in Texas and our community alongside allies kicked up a huge storm? That needs to happen again. Actually, it's been desparately needed for months now. There was one huge wave of pushback, and then silence. But legislation restricting trans rights and access to care have not stopped coming this whole time. We need to be loud and we need to be consistent, not just when things are really bad, but at every small act of aggression, every minor law that pushes the Overton Window on the ""trans issue"" further to their side. Because these people thrive when we let their harm slip under the radar until it's too late.
Mormons gonna Morm. They can come out and say they are indifferent to LGBT people all they want, but this legislation is the direct result of allowing a cult to have near free reign of a state.
Jesus, this makes our TERF island look like a haven for trans people.
I live in Utah and I didn't know about this. I thought our governor was at least a little better than that. There's no way the courts are blocking it, I know my state too well.
I'm so sorry for Utah trans kids... This is horrible and unacceptable. But it won't be blocked, I think, the far right has pulled the overton window enough to their side to make it seem like this is a ""centrist position"".
It *is* Utah, aka Mormon Central, so I'm not surprised. The courts won't block it in that state.
Mormons are the fucking worst.
Better block it then.
Is California trans-friendly?
theres other option to fix it too, fire.

And mrs.peyton.mainacc

I think they have gone private but the account they share isn't and has some very transphobic posts they have also been found out to be racist and a bunch of other crimes they've done behind closed doors including doxxing people putting people in danger and children in danger 
I want all my trans folks to be safe so I want to get the message out there not to trust and to report these people
the bill does not outright ban it, just requires a gender dysphoria diagnosis to get it. srs is banned for youth though which i think is semi-reasonable
This is ridiculous! Do they not want people to be happy? All they are gonna get out of this is lose voters and lose people when they move states or countries
As someone from Utah, this isn‚Äôt a ‚Äúcommon stance.‚Äù The part the part that utahns agree with is the surgeries but very few here have even heard the part about hormone therapy.
Interesting, considering all of its ties to polygamy.
Can they not get blockers at least ?
People keep saying how free America is, we need to make sure that it will stay free for us too.
This is sadly gonna probably cause an increase in suicide of those under 18‚Ä¶ Gender Dysphoria is a fuckin bitch istfg
I thought it made it so they had to be diagnosed with gender dysphoria to get hormones
They're also trying to resume conversion therapy which is currently banned. Not the physical part (like electroshock). Just the talk based ""therapy"" like conversion camp.

That cult hates anyone who isn‚Äôt them. Utah is the world‚Äôs biggest tumor.
This same law in Arkansas has been blocked, appealed (block continued), and appealed again. The final ruling should come soon but for now, care has continued. It will have a bearing in other states. The lawsuit is Brandt v. Rutledge so have hope! The ACLU is on top of these bills and is representing four minor plaintiffs and their families in Arkansas.
It's unconstitutional. The federal courts could easily twist their arm on this one.
not every mormon hates trans people. But A LOT do
Yep. This is why I don't care about all of the people that say things like ""not all conservatives/Republicans hate trans people. Most of us don't care what you do in your own life"" and then they vote for this shit
it's morming time. jokes aside i am really happy to be living in New Zealand rn, america seems to be trying to pass a new bill against trans people every week.
There's still a majority of the US that isn't trying to pass these laws, and several states have already codified trans rights into their state constitutions. Remember, the US is essentially 50 separate countries, and the really conservative states like to pick fights with the federal government for fun!
It's unconstitutional. They are kinda bound by the highest law in the land. If it is not overturned, then the government can take away federal funds. Which would be VERY bad for the Utah government.
It's unconstitutional. If it is not blocked, the federal government can restrict federal funds from the state. That would be VERY bad for Utah's government.
Yes as far as I know. Source: live here
This is false. It bans all youth not already with a diagnosis before the bill came into effect. A diagnosis has always been required for treatment with the way the system was set up.

https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/utah-care-ban-for-trans-youth-takes

That being said, gender affirming surgeries simply do not happen with youth (with the exception of top surgery for late teens, which is extremely beneficial to their health and banning which should also call into question breast augmentation surgeries that are perfectly legal for cis girls) considering medical best practices, that isn't something that needs to be banned by law. The only reason for it to appear explicitly in a bill would be to make it seem like a real issue, to push the ""trans people are chopping up little kids"" narrative, which is untrue
Considering the courts in Utah have blocked enforcement of the Trans sports ban shows that this will likely meet a similar fate. Both bills target trans people in ways that it is difficult to argue they are not discriminating against trans people. Legislators of this bill even refused to change the ban on all plastic surgeries on minors. Equality Utah is planning a lawsuit on this one like they did for the trans sport bill
This bans all forms of medical transition related care for minors, including blockers
No:

""The bill, which rocketed through the senate and the house and featured heated debate in both, bans all trans youth NOT ALREADY DIAGNOSED with gender dysphoria from receiving gender affirming care. It also features a complex web of statutes meant to make gender affirming care impossible to provide, such as a statute that lets anyone go back in time and ‚Äúdisaffirm consent‚Äù up to the age of 25 years old. Collectively, these statutes will effectively end gender affirming care for transgender youth in the state of Utah.""

This means youth who are not already currently receiving affirming care are barred from ever getting it

That's nice <3 I was suicidal before transition and now I live every day like any other person. I take bioidentical hormone supplements that have put me down the natural puberty cycle for the sex I am most comfortable with. Idk how that can be seen as mutilating my body (anymore than someone taking vitamin supplements so their body functions at full capacity) or dysfunctional to my mental health, but keep living in your fantasy where people are somehow ""crazy"" for not perfectly fitting into a social role predetermined for them at birth.

People are born with much MUCH weirder conditions than their sense of self not matching with their genitals; people are born with tumours and without limbs and all kinds of smaller-scale oddities all the time, I don't see how transgender people as a concept are so far fetched to you people considering the complex, multi-stage, and imperfect nature of sex development
Yup. I fucking hate it here and one day I'm gonna leave.

which states have codified trans rights? hoping cali üôè
> unconstitutional

So was slavery.
Man, I wish I had your optimism. I just feel like knowing Utah and how the Mormons run and manipulate everything to be exactly how they want, it's not looking good. Utah is legitimately run by a cult. They have extremely strange laws there that if it were any other state, would never be passed. I just get the feeling that with how deep the Mormon cult runs in that state and with who knows who's pockets are being lined with what type of currency, and with a growing transgender youth population being seen as a blight in the church's eyes, I just can't help but feel hopeless. It may be unconstitutional, but I don't know if the people that are supposed to do anything about it actually will...
Let's hope Biden has some guts I guess
The state court that blocked the trans sport bill cited violations of the Utah constitution‚Äôs equal guarantees and this is the same case.
Ok now that‚Äôs effed up , so we aren‚Äôt even given the chance to hold the the puberty process till we are of age ‚Ä¶‚Ä¶ who are they to do what they please with our bodies , your insecurities aren‚Äôt our problem ‚Ä¶ sorry end rant /

Hello from Colorado!

No, but I understand how constitutional law works and what happened with South Dakota v. Dole.
Maybe you should find out what this bill does, and maybe that will persuade you to stop supporting the party pushing for a genocide against trans people.
Re evaluate this position. It‚Äôs wrong.
Sure, here‚Äôs your acknowledgment: rethink your positions, because you‚Äôre likely very deeply incorrect in all of them. Putting that target on your back ain‚Äôt worth saving money on taxes (which they probably aren‚Äôt actually doing for you anyways, unless you‚Äôre among the mega-rich).
never thought i‚Äôd see a transgender republican
I'm going to try not to come at you too hard here, but I see you have ""femboy she/her BLM"" in your bio. 3 things the republican party are publicly vehemontly against. The republican party is passing anti-lgbt legislation across the nation and wanting to push for it federally. They passed anti-abortion laws across the nation. The defund planned parenthood as much as possible and want to completely close it down (eliminating healthcare for mostly cis women and trans people). They're pro big government despite saying they are the opposite just to deny the citizens better healthcare systems. They're anti education because it's ""indoctrination"". The politicians themselves have claimed to be christian nationalists. They are intentionally even trying to misrepresent the 1st amendment so they can instill christian law while simultaneously speaking down on al-qaeda for doing the same thing because they view Islam as false and radical. Which also just shows that they don't actually care about the constitution as they try to use it to control everyone who has different views and then ignore the rules that apply to them.

I'm just failing to see a single good thing about the party. Sure, they back the 2nd amendment like it's the word of God himself, but many democrats/independents support it as well.
My friend that is rather foolish

Edited for insensitivity insensitivity (sorry)
Yes, the west coast states are all safe!

Doesn't necessarily even need to get that high. I don't even think it will reach the Supreme Court. It is blatantly unconstitutional.
You're not offensive, you're just fundamentally wrong on a number of the facts you listed. Every cell in your body sure does have your chromosomes, but the ones that determin sex have no function long-term outside of guiding some basic processes of development during your formation in the womb and a bit during puberty, which are far far more complicated than just ""cell says do this, so body does every single thing related to sex formation perfectly and without any variation"". The chromosomes are just the first trigger in a huge complicated multi-step system that has a lot of moving parts and will go on to continue to change and develop throighout your life. And chromosomes, when tested, can sometimes not match what you'd expect! And this happens actually fairly often! Because these processes are imperfect and variable! This little piece of your cell does not carry nearly enough information to be define your entire gender and sex, it just sequences in a pattern that binds with other cells in a way that triggers a domino effect of many processes that typically cause sex development in certain typical ways.

People didn't even know chromosomes existed until a couple hundred years ago, but gendered divisions have existed for much longer. We cannot be bogged down in a conversation about chromosomes when they have absolutely no tangible bearing on everyday life. We don't gender certain social roles because people have some microscopic chromosome we cannot see, we do it because of lived reality.

People can have kids, even if theyre trans. And your point fully devalues adoption as just as good of an option

There have been numerous studies on regret rates, and all of them come up with the same conclusion that transition helps the vast vast vast majority of people who pursue it. It is also widely accepted that being trans is not directly caused by or linked to mental health issues or dysfunction, but this relationship is often very profound in the opposite direction, because of the burden of having to live with a discordent identity and facing social stigma. The very few studies suggesting otherwise have been debunked time and time again for their poor scientific rigour. You seem to cite what is essentially the ""social contagion"" theory of being trans, but if you look to any respected academic or medical organization, you will see this is also bunk science that has been discredited. Of course coming out as trans is happening more, as more people are given the knowledge to understand themselves and the avenues to access transition. Left handedness also rose (and eventually plateuaed) when society stopped treating it as the devil

Also, again, hormone therapy is bioidentical. A basic regimen for a trans women has essentially the same risk factors as just... being a woman (and vice versa). Sure, intaking any medication always comes with some other things (like all pills need to be processed through the liver, etc. Though there are other methods of HRT that makes this point moot) but this is why it's a process monitored by your doctor. It makes your body do the opposite puberty that it originally was doing, that's all there really is to it. It is not some crazy experimental drug
I want to live in Oregon, personally
What does SD v. Dole have to do with this and why would the Feds actually give enough of a shit about us to actually challenge the bill?

We've seen the same type of legislation passed in many other states. Why is this one different?
thanks üòä
To clarify legal protections are not the same as having it codified in our constitutions. (I'm a Washingtonian) and one of the republican representatives proposed a G.A.C. ban for under 18s the bill got to the public comment phase (really early) and so me and everyone in our state wide support group left our comments. Afew got replies to their comments on the bill basiclay assuring us the bill was dead on arrival and wouldnt even get a hearing) yhe person whi got the reply sent a followed up messagr suggesting we add protections to the state constitution 
And thr reprrsentative replied again prop wa rep Sharon  

The partys working on adding abortion protection to our state constitution but are shy of the 2/3rds majority needed to let it go to a statewide citizen vote (which only needs 50%)

Si We're 4 senators and 8 representatives short for any state constitution stuff that doesn't have cross party support
Thanks I live in mass and I was worrying a lot over this. Things are still going to get bad in the upcoming years.
Alright! I don't really understand this part. Let's hope for the best!
Go for it! That's a good one too!
SD v. Dole is what the federal government can do if an unconstitutional law is not overturned. 

There are examples of similar bills that have been blocked in states like Alabama and Arkansas. For example, courts have held that any intervention by the state must be based on a compelling interest and have a narrow focus. A federal court found Alabama‚Äôs ban did not meet either because twenty-two major medical associations endorsed using medications for transitioning. A similar thing can be found for this as well.
Indeed!
Thank you for your information. I hope you're right about this one.

We need to talk about Arkansas...	"I've been trying to escape this state for years. I always end up back here. I've always hated living here, but now I simply HATE the state itself.

I'm currently trying to transition MtF. I have a very close friend here who is FtM. My best friend has a non-binary child and a FtM child, who both struggle with anxiety and depression.

Arkansas has already overridden the veto for trans care on peoples under 18 years of age...now they are trying to pass a bill so teachers can be protected while refusing to acknowledge a person's preferred name or gender!?!

As much as I want to raise my voice and fight against this bigotry...I just want to disassociate with this state and get out. If these bills say anything to me, it says this is going to be one of the most dangerous places to live as a trans person. I wish I was rich so I could just move my friend's family, my trans friend and his grandmother, my wife, and myself out of this awful state.

What are some of the most trans-friendly states in the US?"	"The preferred name thing is so asinine and is very discriminatory considering how many cis people have a preferred name; Michael-Mike, Matthew-Matt, Caitlyn-Kate, or even people that prefer to use a middle name instead of their first name. 

I am not in Arkansas, but the bills they have been passing truly anger me and give me concern about other states that may try and use these as framework for their own bills.
I think the most trans-friendly state is California, though any majority democrat state is (usually) friendly to trans people (which..hmm...very weird how most anti-trans states are Republican...)

but yeah, fuck Arkansas. at this point I hope that backwards cousin-fucking hellhole of a state crumbles.
I've heard Washington, Oregon, New York, New Hampshire, Vermont, etc are great. I used to live in FL and a lot of the people are awful, but esp around Orlando there's pockets of huge acceptance. Also they have great laws for legally transitioning, its one of the easier states. I just hope the Republicans never realize that's the case
Maybe, any state is better than Arkansas? But yeah, getting out of deep red states would be a huge help. The GOP is pushing this anti-trans b.s. nationwide, so expect similar garbage bills showing up wherever Repubs are in power. (at least for the next few election cycles. I just don't see this anti-trans junk as the big election winner that the right hopes it will be).
I'm sorry you and your friends are stuck living in that state. I just want to send you all some love from the north, and I hope you find yourself living somewhere that deserves you.
I mean NY is a good place, i havent had that much discrimination against me, and it also has the most socialist legislators, as well as we just legalized merryjewwannas, and im here, and ill totally give you a hug.  
with a mask on cause were not out of the pandemic rn.

**Colorado** has lots of legal protections for trans people. I (enby they) live with my husband here. Trans medicine is covered by insurance. I'm out at work. The **Denver** area and also Boulder are very trans friendly. The biggest general cons of Denver are cost of living and air pollution; there are also racism issues here, but perhaps not as bad as some other big cities. I find gender neutral bathrooms more in the city and nearby towns as far as Nederland, CO. The schooling here supports trans and non-binary children, but I don't have personal experience with that. 

Feel free to ask questions - I'll try my best to answer or provide websites to relevant resources
California and Colorado are two good ones
If you‚Äôre looking at California, look at areas outside the Bay Area and LA/Inland Empire. Their cost of living is too high right now. Colorado is similar. Denver is a little too expensive as well. However, there are plenty of good options on both coast, so do some research and you‚Äôll find a better place.
My (MTF) spouse (AFAB, NB) and her daughter (neuro diverse, LGBTQ questioning) got out of Arkansas years ago thanks to their ex-husband. They escaped to Connecticut. It's the only good thing to come from that marriage, and we're grateful every day. We can't imagine what their lives would be if they were still stuck in that hellhole. 

We need an underground railroad for trans babies.
In 2021.
What the actual fuck, Arkansas?
Arkansas is worse, but Iowa doesn‚Äôt seem far behind. I too hate the state I live in. I‚Äôm actively looking for employment outside of here so my girlfriends can secure trans health care for themselves. I‚Äôm lucky, my private insurance is ran through Michigan. I‚Äôm covered, but I‚Äôm willing to give that up and move with them for a better life where we don‚Äôt feel hated for being us. 

But if I have to give that up and move to somewhere like Chicago, Denver, or the dream of California then I‚Äôll do that, I‚Äôm not abandoning my friends or letting them abandon me. 

It‚Äôs not only that, but the active transphobia we see when trying to date‚Ä¶ we‚Äôve just had enough. You win bigots, the scary trans people are moving.
Northern Virginia

We have the legendary Danica Roem protecting us.
Lucky for you, I am also from Arkansas and have good news. ACLU is filing a lawsuit which means the law will remain unenforceable until some higher action is taken. Speaking of course in reference to HB1570 (SAFE my ass)
Washington and Oregon are good,  though I'd describe Washington as gay and Oregon as queer. Keep in mind though,  they're starting to develop fire seasons with super bad air 1 month out of the year. I'm talking the states' air looked like the Mad Max opening,  maybe worse. So if you have health concerns, east coast may be the way to go.
I live in PA and never had an issue. Maryland and Virginia to the south are very friendly as well. With any of these 3 states they have their red part and blue part. Choose the area carefully. 

I am sure their are friendlier places but this is where I know. Philly, Baltimore, DC areas don‚Äôt seem to take issue with us.
Massachusetts has a clause in its state constitution that prevents laws that cause anyone to be treated as a second class citizen. And this has been used to fix all sorts of LGBTQ+ issues here. It was used to legalize gay marriage here years before it was nation wide.
I would also like to know
I live in CT and it's very trans friendly.

I've heard good things about Delaware. Great nature and cheap housing, plus no tax shopping. :D
I live in Wisconsin (Madison specifically) and it's great. My whole City is super chill and the UW Health system is amazing regarding trans healthcare and transitioning issues.
I live in Denver and apart from random shitheads that live everywhere its been very accepting for me. I'm still very early in my transition and the places I frequent have all been very good at using my preferred name and pronouns.
Are there any pockets of liberal cities or counties?  I live in Kansas, and while there are plenty of assholes, there are also places that are very progressive.
I live in Minnesota and my wife is mtf. Helped her get her permit and driver‚Äôs license last year, and they didn‚Äôt even question her when she asked to have her gender officially changed. Says female with the state now. And we were married back in January and they let her change her ‚Äúentire‚Äù name (first, middle and last) without question. We‚Äôre a little bit outside the twin cities so there is ‚Äúsome‚Äù stigma out here, but people are too busy making money and living good in this state to really care. And if you live ‚Äúin‚Äù the twin cities, especially Minneapolis, it‚Äôs an LGBT haven. Jobs pay good out here, and if you stay just outside of the metro or anywhere rural the cost of living is incredibly cheap.

But probably the best experience thus far was when she got her first speeding ticket. The officer looked at her license and called her ‚Äúma‚Äôam‚Äù the entire interaction and was extremely respectful. This happened on a rural highway going to Brainerd. Since she moved in with me not once have I worried about her safety, and my health insurance through the Union is going to cover a lot of the cost of getting her back on hrt amongst other things.
You need to escape that place, Hon. Arkansas is the home of the KKK. That says a lot about Arkansas.
If we are talking about the Midwest. Minnesota is still pretty good for trans folks. Unfortunately it‚Äôs surrounded by hateful assholes. So there‚Äôs that‚Äôs. In general the west coast and northeast are the most lgbt friendly states in general.
Come to South Australia, we'll be very glad to have you! I hope things work out for you and your friends m'lady
I‚Äôd check this out to get a better idea of which states are safer: https://transgenderlawcenter.org/equalitymap

TLDR; these states have the most legal protections for trans people: California, Oregon, Washington, Nevada, Colorado, Minnesota, Illinois, New York, Vermont, Maine, Rhode Island, Maryland, Connecticut, New Jersey, DC

Arkansas had a negative rating, along with a lot of the southern states. 

I can personally vouch for California, I‚Äôve been living here since I came out and started transitioning and haven‚Äôt met any medical or legal resistance. Some things have been pricy (the court order to change my name and gender marker was over $400) but the legal process itself was simple. I‚Äôm about to move to Minnesota to be closer to the accepting side of my family, so I hope this map means things with be just as simple there. 

I hope this helps some, and I hope your friends and family can find a safer place to live.
This Wikipedia page gives an excellent state-by-state rundown of various legal rights for trans folks. https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transgender_rights_in_the_United_States

The west coast is generally going to be your friendliest option. I‚Äôm personally targeting a move from Michigan to Seattle. However, I will say that Michigan has excellent rights regarding trans healthcare. I was able to start HRT without any unnecessary gatekeeping via the University of Michigan, which has a superb gender health services program. https://www.uofmhealth.org/conditions-treatments/transgender-services
I agree this place is become terrible in all honesty the entire US is becoming something of a shit show! I also live in arkansas being GF myself it scares me to think how people would react seeing me more feminine I've gotten to the point I dont want to go out in public feminine even with people who support me by my side in fear of being attacked but ive already bought a house and can't leave though desperate I am so ive decided to help our community in any way possible! Im gonna start protesting and educating others in hopes to make a better future for my lgbtq+ family!
[Check out this article](https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/2020/06/19/the-best-and-worst-states-for-lgbtq-people/111968524/) \- I don't blame you wanting to leave Arkansas. Those bills are direct hit jobs against our community.
start a YT channel addressing How shit and transphobic these states are, then if you earn enough you can move states
I am m2f and moved out of Arkansas just a few months ago.  I knew it was transphobic, but I did not realize that they were the leaders in transphobia.  

I recently came out on FB, and everyone seems to be trying to understand, but they are still insisting on using the wrong pronouns and dead-naming, and supporting parts of this legislation.  

I probably will not be going back for any visits due to all these hate laws.
I live in northern Maryland and it's pretty chill here from what I know but it's expensive
never left this state but from what i know, maryland is a good place
Come to Massachusetts! Boston is so full of gays we're like a giant extended family - ""oh you know so-and-so? That's my roommate's friend's ex"" 

Pride is nothing but dodging exes at Govn't Center every June 

In all seriousness, I hope you're taking care of yourself. There's not much I can do to help (already sent a few emails) but I'm sending as many good vibes as I can from the east coast :(
Well it might take a bit, but realistically none of their bullshit is going to last very long. They will be challenged in court and ultimately we will likely win, but I would definitely still get out of a deep red state if I financially could. The problem is, blue states have way higher cost of living which is why all the rich suburban Republican bigots and old people stay there.
Maryland is pretty good with trans folks. (stay out of pg county. and the more rural areas.) PG is just where a lot of the sport legends and their families come from for some reason, so if one thing leads to another then a trans person could get their ass beat here. I‚Äôd stay in Howard County, maybe Columbia. It‚Äôs pretty pricey, but the quality of everything is amazing there.
Ugh, I also escaped a red state, and it was such a relief. A few years back my grandmother suddenly thought I should go back and kept pressuring me to do so, and I seriously was a mess about it. It's not hyperbole to say I have lasting trauma from living there, not to mention from moving elsewhere and having people constantly ask where I was from. These days I still find myself being elusive about where I grew up. It's really bad.
Colorado is a much better place if you need to go somewhere
Colorado is fairly safe. If you want as mush protection as possible, go for Boulder. It's known as one of, if not, the gayest town in Colorado. But it's kinda expensive to live there cause it's a college town. Just don't live in Aurora. It's expensive and not super safe. Arvada is good and so is Louisville. Golden is also great! Make sure to do research on where to live.
Wichita Kansas is actually pretty good with the people. I haven't experienced hardly any hate. We have a legislator who is mtf (and happens to be the wife of my therapist). Kansas in the rural parts is dangerous. And our government is also happily passing bills similar to Arkansas.

All of this terrifies me. I started my transition a year ago, at 46. My depression is gone, and I finally have what I've always wanted, or am at least well on my way. The other night I had a full on anxiety attack. I was crying and shaking uncontrollably for an hour. All I could think was ""I'm finally happy, and they're going to take everything away from me""

These politicians have no idea how harmful these bills are. Or they just don't care, because we are not real to them.
As a friend from next door, I agree with you, and I wanna get out of here too
I‚Äôm in the Chicago area and we‚Äôre pretty friendly. We‚Äôre also an informed consent state so you don‚Äôt need to involve any doctors to get HRT. It‚Äôs definitely not as cheap as Arkansas though. I lived there back in the 90‚Äôs and was able to pay my bills working as a carhop. Can‚Äôt do that here.
you don't have to be a hero. leave if you can.
They're trying to pass a bill to allow teachers to be protected while not using someone's preferred name or pronouns?

My temptation to straight up delete Arkansas from the map is rising fast.
I suggest Iowa. We're pretty safe here, and we don't have any rules against bathroom usage or our rights being restricted. [Laws regarding schools](https://educateiowa.gov/resources/legal-resources/legal-lessons/equality-transgender-students) are pretty trans-friendly here, and there's plenty of places to set up HRT through. It's pretty rural out here, so there's not much danger of being attacked for being trans. I live in one of the bigger cities more toward the Wisconsin and Illinois separation, and it's been a good place for acceptance of LGBT+ rights. Apartments over here can be a little expensive sometimes, but if you find one that's pet friendly it's usually cheaper.
NJ isn‚Äôt that bad in the Trenton area.  We aren‚Äôt really supportive more then we just don‚Äôt give a fuck what you identify as.  In saying that I mean we don‚Äôt care what you want to identify as because it doesn‚Äôt affect us.  I‚Äôm still ‚Äúin the closet‚Äù with my family but that‚Äôs because I live with my 80 year old huge bigot of a grandfather.  Though my aunt is lesbian and I have multiple friends who are gay/trans/queers.  I mean Hopewell Valley Regional School District has a lgbtq club for middle/high school students.  All that said most of the state is very pricey
I‚Äôve lived in Arkansas for over twenty-five years now, but I‚Äôm originally from TX. There are many well-deserved stereotypes in AR, but it‚Äôs not fair to paint the whole state as ‚Äúcousin-fucking‚Äù trans-phobic rednecks. Certainly, there are many insensitive and self-righteous people here, just as there are in other places; however, Eureka Springs, AR  is one of the most trans-friendly towns in the entire county. There are also a few cosmopolitan areas in Arkansas like Fayetteville, etc. 

I‚Äôm a life-long cross dresser and more transgender now.  I enjoy a Female-Led Relationship in which my wife is the acknowledged head of our household. Her happiness is paramount, but I‚Äôm not her slave. She was born and raised in Arkansas, and has come to accept my feminine inclinations and dress. I support her and contribute to the household income, plus I take care of most of the domestic responsibilities. She appreciates my support, sensitivity and my desire to defer to her decision-making authority. I don‚Äôt flaunt my femininity in public (probably would not in any city or state) but I do present my femininity in subtle and submissive ways in public, which anyone who looks closely enough could realize. Most people don‚Äôt care one way or the other. Even her mother who is of a much older generation is comfortable with me wearing my nightgowns, etc when we visit her. I don‚Äôt detect any adverse judgements on her part; in fact she has fun sitting around with me in the evenings and mornings having a ‚Äúgirl party‚Äù and it all seems normal. Neither my wife, nor her mother knew this side of me when we married. I think living anywhere is what you make of it as long as you‚Äôre sensitive to others - it goes both ways. 

As far as the politics, I‚Äôm more libertarian and not a fan of governmental intervention in our lives. The governor of AR is trying to convey that he too is not a fan of governmental intrusion into our personal lives. He just doesn‚Äôt want minors making unilateral decisions about SRS, etc., without the due diligence, consent of parents, and medical and psychiatric professionals. It doesn‚Äôt mean that a minor child cannot move forward with transition if the parents agree. And teachers should not have to fear a lawsuit for not using a student‚Äôs preferred name and pronoun; however, teachers should be as kind and considerate of transgender students as with anyone else.  Government legislation is not the answer to the way we conduct our personal lives, as long as the way we behave doesn‚Äôt endanger others.
Come to the west coast! Oregon, Washington and California are pretty great depending on the area (always gonna be best near a big city) I think Seattle has been my personal best experience and I have lived in all three states. But that is Seattle proper, there is a lot or red rural Washington that isn't as accepting
I‚Äôm very nervous about these bills showing up here in Wisconsin. The republicans almost have a 2/3s majority in the assembly and senate
>but yeah, fuck Arkansas. at this point I hope that backwards cousin-fucking hellhole of a state crumbles.

So much this. My mother brought me here as a kid. I detested it then...and I have left a few times as an adult. My wife's family is from here, which is the most recent reason we returned(2018)...and we've regretted returning since.

I am now the last person of my own family still in this state, and it hasn't been for lack of trying. If I'm being honest with myself, I carry a bit of resentment toward my mother who just up and left to be near my sister saying, ""I never saw myself staying in Arkansas forever."" (Really? But you were okay basically dragging your children here, kicking and screaming?)

My biggest concern with Cali is cost. I always wanted to go to Colorado when I was a kid. I have family from there and always dreamed of living there as a kid, however cost of living is growing there as well.

For being in a bottom-feeder state, these concerns become much greater, considering jobs here pay diddly-squat, so trying to slide to basically any other state requires much more savings and preparation than otherwise.
Can confirm, I just moved to the Bay Area and it‚Äôs everything I could‚Äôve wished for. I‚Äôm no longer alone, and people on the street don‚Äôt seem to question me every time they see me, like they did back home. 

Also fuck Arkansas, all my homies hate Arkansas
Lifelong WA resident here. Washington is *excellent* for us. That and don't forget our almost unfair amount of natural beauty.
I live in Washington and yeah it's pretty great overall. Unfortunately, I'm in a pretty conservative part of Washington, so that sucks, but it's not conservative enough that we are denied healthcare
My dad is homosexual and lives in West Palm. I consider all the time living near him...but it is such a red state in some places, it still becomes truly terrifying to me at the thought of just going from one hateful state to another.
MA isnt bad. MN southern part actually has a really decent community too. MN was  **first** U.S. **state** to outlaw discrimination based on sexual orientation and gender identity in 1993,
My dad is homosexual and lives in West Palm. I consider all the time living near him...but it is such a red state in some places, it still becomes truly terrifying to me at the thought of just going from one hateful state to another.
There are several states that are trying to be worse, though.
The best! But it's an expensive place to live.
Just because they want that doesn‚Äôt mean you have to do that. FYI. 

Your life is your life, careers aren‚Äôt predetermined by your parents.

I‚Äôd say get the hell out when it comes to college. Apply out of state to wherever you want (Just make sure it‚Äôs a welcoming state to us) and never look back. 

Of course visit if you‚Äôre on good terms with your parents **and** it‚Äôs safe for *you* to go there.
Also I currently live in the South Bay and there's way more conservative people here than one might think. I rarely get gendered correctly at my work and I'm pretty positive some of it is intentional. Half or more of the people at my office voted for Trump
I was actually thinking of something similar, kind of a mashup between the underground railroad and the houses from ball culture. There could be an app that helps organize the whole thing, with the intent of finding people to provide lodging on the way up, somewhere to stay until you get situated, and perhaps even find housing, support services, and jobs once you've transplanted. 

It would have to be focused on families and people old enough to go out on their own, though, and moderating it would be hella difficult because human trafficking.
Denver is nice. I live here (i also have another top level reply with details)
They‚Äôre trying though. 

See PA HB972‚Ä¶

I'll second PA in the Philly area. Philly's actually a big destination for trans folks, since it gives protections, has a decent number of healthcare options (the admittance lines are getting longer, though), there's still affordable places to live, and most people are quite agreeable.

That being said, the roads here suck, the PPD are very racist, and (as u/Elizabeth-The-Great notes) the state legislature is a big turd.

I think about this all the time. My FtM friend in Eureka Springs agrees to do a YT channel with me. I will be starting my HRT soon, hopefully...so I fear it may be some time.before I'm comfortable enough to be in front of a camera.

My wife and my temporary solution is to be in the Fayetteville and Eureka Springs area, which is the most trans-friendly area in Arkansas. We have family and friends there too. 

This would hopefully be a easier means to escape the state, as I may actually be able to work in the field of my degree, unlike where I am currently located.
I identify with this so much! I'm so horribly embarrassed about the state and town I'm from, that when asked I tell them, ""I'm from all over.""  Which isn't completely wrong. Moved around a few times...but always in red states...and I've always wished differently.
I'm actually scratching my head....wondering if you are my literal friend and family practically next door.
Just copy me to a new folder before you hit delete.
Similar thing in SC
I mean NC is already pushing a similar bill (just 21 instead of 18) through, and it's 69/51 republican/democrat so it's likely to pass, and if it passes in NC it's likely to sweep into SC as well
I‚Äôm also worried, if Arkansas gets away with it, Utah likely won‚Äôt be far behind. I want out of this cesspit of religious conservatism for many reasons, but at least I guess they‚Äôre mostly the passive-aggressive kinda bigots instead of outright-aggressive. Small comfort but there‚Äôs probably worse places to be trans, even if here also sucks.
I'm in Wisconsin myself and it's getting scary.
I always feel bad thinking about leaving bad states because then it just lessens the number of people available to fight against the bullshit legislation, but when something as severe as this garbage pops up, it might just be best to dip. I've been sticking around Utah and doing what I can do advocate for trans rights where I can. There was a bill like arkansas I think but it failed here fortunately, so there's still hope. But also I think Utah is starting to trend blue according to some predictions
For what it's worth, I think Colorado is actually quite progressive.
The problem with states with ok people is that they are expensive. You could try Vermont.
I hear NM is pretty decent on the trans-rights front. They have informed consent HRT from what I hear, anyway, so less bullshit medical gatekeeping hoops to jump through.
You could try moving to New Mexico, it's pretty trans friendly especially in cities like Albuquerque and the cost of living isn't too bad
Yes yes San Francisco area is really lgbtq+ (I want to go to Cal when I‚Äôm in college!) 

I live in SoCal, in a more suburbs area and there‚Äôs more republicans and conservatives here than the big cities of California, but it‚Äôs still really accepting. I had a couple trans classmates :)

For sure. Luckily my area had a good little pocket thst protected its insiders but everyone else was so hateful and insane. Southern FL is just complete trash honestly, and the north and panhandle gets the same way.
Hehe, Utah.
I don't see it as a state thing. This is a GOP trying to keep a slim tiny winnable majority thing. There's nothing grassroots about ""HEY LET'S ALL FREAK OUT ABOUT THE TRANS IN BATHROOMS NOW!!!!"".
[deleted]
Weird. I get the occasional strange look up in Redding but I have no real problems so far.
Yep. I know. But the people here are nothing but supportive. Unfortunately the State Legislature are republicans and the governor is Democratic... the state is hugely divided thanks to the urban centers in the state. I highly doubt it will pass... nor more restrictive measures. I kinda feel like the bill is a fuck you to the governor who did everything in his power to turn this state blue last year. My kids schools in a have trans and rainbows all over them. For reference I live in central pa and have lived in Philly. I am so surprised at the support my kids have even in this rural part of the state. For reference my daughter is gay and her school was very supportive. My kids are also mixed race... There is an entire gay community in the school. So much diversity in a little town... very surprised how welcoming this place was. 

I believe (don‚Äôt quote me) PA Republicans are some of the only ones at federal levels to vote pro LGBT (at times)
The whole situation sounds terrible
Oregon and Washington are two of the best states to be trans in
On the east coast, northern VA, MD, and Southeast PA are all pretty good.
I wish you the best of luck for the future and I hope to God you get the body you desire! Godspeed rebel
Wait, are you me? ""I'm from all over"" is my go-to as well. We lived in some cool places until we moved for the last time when I was 10. The worst thing is, we moved around for my dad's education, but ended up going back. So i was born in the shitty state too. Of course my cister was born in a really great, progressive state, and but she lives in the stupid state still, and has no intention of leaving.

Ugh.
I wish, but I'm from next door statewise
Same like utah looks nice from a state park standpoint but I can handle how conservative the state is
Well, Utah already has the House Bill 302 trying to ban trans athletes. They were already on their way down that road. Arkansas just beat them to it. I‚Äôm with you though, I‚Äôm getting out of here as soon as I can.
You must have spent your time in Denver, Boulder, and/or one of the ski resorts.
ish. There is a bit of an independence streak in coloradoans, which helps progressive issues when the answer is to keep laws from being created. There are also good blue strongholds as well, but there is a good mix in the state.
Can confirm the Burlington area in Vermont is pretty supportive. That being said, it absolutely is expensive and getting a decent full time job is one hell of a struggle as a younger person.
This is actually a huge surprise to me. My homosexual father and hsi homosexual twin sister grew up in the Roswell area. And they talk about the absolute fear they had/have of anyone there ever finding out...

Then again, that was around 50 years ago, so that probably makes a big difference.
I have lived in the Bay Area all my life, and no one blinks when someone is LGBTQ. It is wonderfully diverse ethnically, culturally, weatherwise (don't like the weather? drive 20 minutes), and foodwise. That being said, we have a housing crunch, and it's expensive to live here. I wouldn't live anywhere else, though, unless you can't afford it. That's why we have a Plan B for retirement: house in Portland.
thank you bot
Surprisingly the Governor seems to be less transphobic than the legislature, so that's nice.
Very true. This is a Republican thing and it's a problem in Republican dominated states.
Also, you can own a house in a state you don't live in. get an education, get out of your state, rent the house in arkansas out to someone or sell it. My parents have the same plan for me with their place in newhampshire, but I'm **not** living in the sticks my whole life. I'm considering making it a family vacation house, where any member of the family, aunts, cousins, etc. can go and stay in the mountains for a long weekend, bring any friends they want, and we all share the cost, making the upkeep minimal/a shared responsibility. That way the house stays in the family, like my parents want, but I don't have to be tied to it
I've only really experienced this in my work place, whenever I'm going about my business and in the public everything is pretty great so I wouldn't say it's the dominant culture in the area by any means, just that there are pockets of conservatism like this. And even in the office it isn't terrible, I haven't had anyone say rude things to me, just the passive aggressively misgendering and occasionally deadnaming (I think mostly it's not intentional but I also know that sometimes it is definitely intentional).
I figured as much, but it gave me a good laugh realizing I don't know their reddit usernames.
I lived in the Denver/Boulder area for about 5 years.

If I ever retire, it is currently at the top of the list of locations.

Fuck Texas	I learned about the anti trans bill in Texas and I have been obsessing over it for like 2 hours now I am scared I don't know what I would do if I am not able to get treatment I don't know how people even thought this was a good idea it will kill so many and make so many peoples lives worse and for what the summery of the bill is something about protecting children and stuff but this will do the opposite I am so stressed out about this and I will have to wait for an answer I just don't know what I ( or any other trans youth in Texas for that matter ) will do if this passes	"Just Googled it. Thats some BS. 18? That's crazy. 14? Sure. I can draw the line at 14. Maybe even 15. But 18?? Someones gotta explain transitioning to those old guys.
It will KILL SO MANY TRANS CHILDREN, I AM SO FUCKING MAD OMG
[removed]
Agreed, Fuck this wretched place...
Tbh, I just, really want to know, if they actually have evidence that these transphobic acts actually protects children, because I want to see the look on their faces when they try to find a bullshit excuse for these bills
[deleted]
Dude most of my friends and I are trans and we all live in texas. I hate the government but I don‚Äôt hate where I live (DFW area). I know my mom hates the thing too, but my dad has said out loud that he supports it. I swear to fucking god the only reason I hang out with my dad is because of the stray cats outside and the two cats we have at his house. He doesn‚Äôt even care about my emotions at this point. But my mom on the other hand, she supports transgender people and pro-transgender things.
Arkansas passed the same bill but i think it‚Äôs 21 here
These malicious harpies are not worthy of the American space program.
I posted this in another thread about this topic.

It‚Äôll never stand up in court. Doesn‚Äôt even come close to the legal definition of abuser as the treatment is overseen and prescribed by a medical doctor licensed by the State of Texas. One cannot be prosecuted for seeking medical treatment for their children.
I used to live in texas and it angers me whenever I saw that they want to pass these 2 bills. Like just what the fuck. All of these republicans say they care about the lives of children yet are trying to cause a lot of children who are trans to be harmed for being who they are. I wish a lot of allies would understand that a lot of stuff we face is hard if they are just sitting on the sidelines doing nothing while we are being targeted just for being trans.
It's disgusting. There is plenty of evidence that receiving gender affirming care improves mental health and reduces risk of suicide. They'll all cite religious reasons for voting the way they do, not science, because there is none supporting their views. Hopefully these anti-trans laws being considered in so many states end up making their way to the supreme court and get deemed unconstitutional like they would be here in Canada.

So sorry you live in such a terrible place to be trans. Stay strong and do your social transitioning if you're comfortable with it.
Really hoping that the human rights violations catch up to the people trying to pull this shit and they face just punishments before their hateful asses die of natural causes. Its disgusting.
I live in Texas and I was about to come out to my dad too. I wanted to start this summer, but looks like if my dad doesn‚Äôt stop me the government will.
It‚Äôs people who likely know very little about trans people trying to protect them, but who have m no understanding of HRT

Write and call ALL of them and threaten a boycott if they do not threaten to leave Texas over this bill. Twitter is the BIGGEST THING here. If you can make something go viral, then the companies will face a lot more pressure. Make complicit companies and the states feel an economic gut-punch for their crimes.

Secondly, write to your representatives and tell them that they MUST pass H.R.5 -- the Equality Act, for those who are not aware -- as soon as possible to ensure Trans people are protected from laws like this.

I‚Äôm just an ally here in Houston and wanted to say there is a great group of folks at Lambda (on Clay) that care and have meetings like ACA (Adult Children of Alcoholics....  which is actually FOR ANYONE from or in a dysfunctional home) as well as Al-Anon and other 12 step stuff.  I love that place.  It‚Äôs a godsend.  

Also Legacy Community Health center.  Legacy has counseling, psychiatry as well as health services all under one roof in Montrose but they do have other locations in outer lying areas.  They would be a great resource for anyone near here.  

As far as the bill is concerned I just wanted to say I‚Äôm truly sorry.  They think they are protecting you because there have been people who have regretted transitioning.  They aren‚Äôt helping.  They don‚Äôt get it and I don‚Äôt know what the answer is but getting loud never hurts.  It‚Äôs so hard to a cis person to wrap their head around feeling and being trans.  I can‚Äôt imagine having a child be so incredibly unhappy as puberty hits but at the same time can I be certain my child wont be regretful?  I do hope all parents support their trans kids to the best of their ability. As a trans person do you feel more harm will come to them psychologically?  This is what they need to know.  From the mouths of those who have experienced it.  Speak out loudly. Directly to law makers.  

Love y‚Äôall.
Trying my best to tell anyone who'll listen how much bullshit it is.

If that fails I'm either moving out of this fucking state, or protesting until it's found unconstitutional.
[removed]
Move???
There sure are some places that want to make it hellish to be trans, fuck those idiots indeed. OP I hope you can find hope in the fact not everywhere is taking the path Texas is. Even so, turn this rightful outrage into action if you can, getting organized is the best defence against right wing politicians.
I‚Äôm 29 and lived in Texas my whole life. My parents are transphobic as can be. If I had parents that cared about mental health I probably would have transitioned much earlier in life. I‚Äôm just starting T because I‚Äôm now in a safe space with a supportive spouse and work family. I hate laws like this I‚Äôm so angry as well. I‚Äôm planning on moving out of Texas. Fuck Texas. That tells you something. I am Texas born and raised with so much of the stereotypical Texas pride I bleed Lone Star but now?? FUCK TEXAS
Texas has a power of putting people at risk of death. The no-mask allowance thing, now this.
Thats why it's Texass!
 I'm in my 20s and I haven't found a place to get treatment here anyways.
Well its obvious Texas and a lotta back water like places will get laws like that placed cause as a certain song says
They dont care about us. All they actually care about is the money. Hell all politicians will say ""i care about trans rights"" then the moment theyre making money and are in power theyre like ""haha fuck you eat a cock"" unfortunately thats how the us is these days
[removed]
Wait what anit trans bill in texas? I just hearing about this.
I‚Äôm so fucking sorry friend, this is stupid. I‚Äôm in Texas too, but I believe in us. No matter what, we can get through this together and make a better world for everyone
What upsets me is when people ruin the one life people have to live their life. Any kind of happiness or individuality is destroyed. Where do they think they have the right to tell people what makes them happy or who they are inside. They have no clue theyre just scared of their own made up stories.
Is there somewhere centralized these attacks could be followed/fought? Not counting sports bills I can think of GA, NC and Texas in the last week. Can we push to protect nationally? I wish I understood the strategy too because I feel like it‚Äôs swelling towards a larger move but I don‚Äôt know what it is. Also are there ways we can support individually? Like can people receive treatment out of state? Can we figure out how to ship people needed treatment?
wait what is it?
Living in Texas can suck
The question is if they'll listen
I still find it so fucking dumb that the majority of world leaders everywhere is cis, heterosexual white, old men (cis hetero white old women come in next) who barely know anything about the current world or it‚Äôs people and hate minorities. Like wtf should we even expect

Yeah, the only thing that was really keeping me here is that Austin seems relatively accepting(and also the fact that I'm 14 and can't move anywhere). Now not only is it too hot it might be illegal for me to hecking exist
turns out they can make laws based on whatever ""evidence"" they want
Ah yes, perfect. Because I'm sure their parents can just quit their jobs, pull the kids out of school, leave family, friends and home behind at the drop of a hat. And it's a totally reasonable solution since we don't want to make old conservatives uncomfortable..

Bruh.
Yes every single fucking trans person in the entire state of texas should just move, they don't all have that luxury.
Ah yes. Because discriminated transgender middle schoolers and high schoolers and other kids are completely independent without their transphobic families and are completely capable of moving to another place.
Ok, let‚Äôs use some basic logic here. This bill would effect trans youth, so the people who would be moving are the trans youth. Each individual trans youth would have to convince their entire family to just stop everything and move out of state, do you really think that‚Äôs going to work?
https://news.yahoo.com/news/texas-lawmakers-proposed-bill-separate-220329799.html
As far as out of state goes it should be fine for most cases but because they trying to classify it as child abuse in Texas the parents would still be in danger
The cruelty is the point. 

We need to focus our energy on reminding the so-called allies that being an ally doesn't just mean saying vapid things like ""you're valid"", it means actually fighting alongside us. And we need to remind the rest of the rainbow that we fought for them, now they should honor that call in return.
Haha that's hilarious that you would even think that's a question.
I mean as world leaders, they should actually idk, maybe try to keep up with the world, the people, and the minorities.
""I‚Äôm so fucking my most humble apology"" goodbot
Let's just make laws against transphobia because that's ACTUALLY hurting children
Mean fuck i got the cash to move comfortably but the real struggle is finding a damn job. If your resume shows your in another state theyll just skip u in a heart beat.
I understand. For me and my kids I would relocate if that‚Äôs what needed to happen.
OH FUCK THAT RIGHT THERE
I‚Äôm sorry so the bill is saying that providing necessary, lifesaving, safe and effective treatment is abuse? Am I understanding you correctly in that if a parent takes their kid out of state for treatment they could still be accused of abusing their children?
yes, this. this is the next stupid thing that the republicans and democrats will treat as some abstract moral argument instead of actually doing anything about it and preventing real harm that will come to trans kids.
We need to find a way to force these guys to see the humanity of the people they are hurting. That's the only way.
but muh free speech to be hateful towards minority groups and incite violence against them!!!!!!1!!! /s
Even then they don't care. Right wing people are inherently selfish (like, there's even been legit studies proving it), they only care about what they think will benefit them the most.

They will aggressively look after you if you're in their 'tribe' or inner circle, but will not see you as human if you're not.

Unfortunately the \*only\* way we will stop them is making these mindsets/opinions so toxic that if they dare mention them, they will risk losing their livelihoods.
Honestly, we need to find a way to remove them permanently... That's the only thing they will respond to...

Mystery bill after gender affirming surgery?	"So about 3 months ago I got a chest reduction as a part of my gender affirming care with Kaiser, I was quoted that my surgery would be $3,303 and my co pay was $303. I payed that the day of my surgery and was told that was the only thing I had to pay but now months later I get a bill for $55,399.39 (that‚Äôs the exact number on the bill) and that I have to pay $803.04 in a new payment plan. Is this normal? I‚Äôve called billing already and I‚Äôm waiting for a call back still but I‚Äôm just really worried that I won‚Äôt have the money to cover this. Like that‚Äôs my whole rent and I‚Äôm still recovering financially after not being able to work for 4 weeks after my surgery.



Edit: I wanna thank everyone for their suggestions and personal stories! It‚Äôs definitely helped with my anxiety and I feel like I have some options I can try now. You are all so sweet and amazing!"	"Don't make a payment until you are sure this is actually something they can charge you for. A payment for a bill or debt can be considered agreement to pay or accepting responsibility for the debt. I would definitely make some calls to insurance, your surgeon, the hospital, whoever sent you the bill, etc to figure out where that charge is coming from and why. That's a massive bill to just accept in general but especially having not been told about it prior. I would definitely contest it however possible. Sometimes what happens is they use an out of network anesthesiologist, who suddenly tries to charge you full cost. Idk where you live but I believe in the US this was recently made illegal, and they should not be charging you for your surgeon using an out of network anesthesiologist without you knowing if this is what happened.
[deleted]
Ask for an itemized bill in addition to what other people are suggesting you do.
There are about a million different ways health insurance is set up in the US, so it's a wonder anything ever works at all in this country 

You're going to have to take time to work through this and it sucks. That being said, here are a few suggestions :

- match up bills with any documentation from Kaiser. Do you get Explanation of Benefits forms from claims? If not can you see details of claims on their website?
- is there any reference on the big bill to your insurance? If not, they might have sent you a bill instead of sending it to Kaiser first. They should submit a claim in that case.
- if they did submit a claim and it wasn't paid, did they get the info right? Anything from misidentification (wrong name or birthdate) to bad coding (wrong procedure listed) to contract errors ( billed under wrong doctor's ID) is possible

That $55K bill sounds like a list price and you weren't expecting it. You'll need to call Kaiser and the provider and it's a big hassle but don't despair yet! 

It's really hard to give exact advice when there are so many variables but I hope this helps. If you have any other questions, feel free to DM me.
I got hit like that for a CT once.  The money from the insurance company didn't arrive by an arbitrary date, so they treated it as 'not covered' and sent me a bill for almost $10k.  For a single CT scan!

I called my insurance company, the agent confirmed that I should be paying $0, and assured me he'd take care of it.  Couple weeks later I got an 'updated invoice' showing that they got paid \~$2k, wrote off the rest, and I owed nothing.

And this is why the US desperately, desperately needs single-payer.  How it sits now is a balkanized clusterfuck \[up to and including my therapist being out-of-network because the company told him 'we feel we have enough providers, your application to be in-network is denied'\] that puts the 'crazy' in bureaucracy.
That's insane for a reduction, even if you had to pay in full. Ftm top usually maxes out at 10K (usd), so you've definitely been heavily over-billed. Do not pay anything, even if it becomes overdue, not a single cent. Do not sign up for the payment plan. Call the billing department first, make them explain every charge and tell them to file a new claim if anything is different. Call your insurance company, get all the info for the claim. That includes every provider. Write it down, and have them send you a copy of everything. If they stand by it, tell them you want to dispute it, and don't back down until a dispute is opened. There is definitely something wrong here, but you can usually cut through insurance bullshit if you keep calling and go hard on them.
I don't know much but for sure call your insurance first and not billing. If push comes to shove you can ask for an itemized bill and usually they reduce the price drastically because they won't be able to get away with charging, for example, $50 for a bandaid or whatever.
OP. Does that bill have any billing codes on it??

CPT or ICD 10?

I am curious if they upcoded, unbundled, or billed for services not provided.

Edit: spelling
Did you check to see if you had an out of pocket maximum? Because I had my CO pay with my bottom surgery then I got a 2k bill for my out of pocket maximum after.
There's a good chance you're in for a fight with the insurance side of things at Kaiser. Good luck OP, don't pay for anything, and make sure you have any and all documentation showing what you were quoted and what was agreed upon.
so i got kaiser too and i went to get labs and was told my copay would be $10, which i paid when i went to get the labs, and like a week later i received a bill for $250 üò≠ fuck insurance its so useless, it was literally cheaper for me to go through planned parenthood and pay out of pocket, than to try and use my kaiser insurance at a kaiser medical center
Something really fishy is going on with this bill...

$55k for a breast reduction?  When the average cost of a reduction is 5.5k and a double mastectomy maxes at 10k with no insurance. 

Like what the hell. Did they assign someone else‚Äôs surgery bill to you or something and cause an overlay? O.o
If you live in the US (which I‚Äôm assuming you do cause Kaiser), surprise medical bills are now illegal. So unless they told you about it beforehand, I wouldn‚Äôt pay it until you can either hear back that it was a mistake or talk to a lawyer.
Another option is to call the hospitals business department and ask for help paying the bill because you‚Äôre low income. All hospitals have to have a program for low income people to help with costs. It doesn‚Äôt matter if you‚Äôre actually low income. Just doing the paperwork is enough most of the time to get rid of the bill.
One of the doctors could have been out of network. Login to your insurance website and look up the EOD (claims)
Ask for an itemized Bill
Does kaiser give good trans care? I tried to look them up bc my insurance covers stuff with them and i couldn't find too much on hrt options, do you have a lot of experience with them?
i had similar - it might be because your surgery was pre-approved beforehand, then the surgery date was after the approved date range and you just need to get it retroactively preapproved again :)
I would never pay that bill. I‚Äôm sorry but they would have to fight a brick wall for seven years.
I've been in a similar sounding situation, but it could be different.  Hospitals and healthcare providers will sometimes send you a bill for a charge your insurance already negotiated down and paid the remainder of to try to get more money out of you.  They just claim they haven't yet gotten a response to the claim they filed with insurance and send you the whole bill.  Call your insurance provider or go on their website and find a copy of the claim and what insurance paid so if the hospital tries to charge you for that you can show the insurance documents showing it's already been paid.
I'm not the best at paying my bills promptly I have learned, 

If you sit on it and wait a while, a couple months-ish, a lot of these kind of bills just go away. Like it takes quite a while for everything to work its way through the system.

If you pay it they'll take the money. If you wait a bit, they'll find the correct way to run it through insurance etc., and it'll get paid, or be re-calculated away.
YOUR RENT IS 55000 DOLLARS?!!??!
If you open up a go fund me I think there would be more than enough people here willing to help you. üòä If a lot give little it's still a big number in the end.
Demand an itemized bill. This will show the cost of everything you are being charged for as part of your care. Often times this will reduce the bill drastically.
Consider consulting with an attorney before you pay anything
Don‚Äôt pay it. It‚Äôs my understanding that it won‚Äôt affect your credit it you might want to ask a lawyer. I‚Äôve also heard that surprise hills are illegal too now but that‚Äôs also a question for a lawyer. Or maybe some Google research.
Wish I could get surgery and pay after -_- everything I find requires insurance, or that you pay in full. I have insurance for my state, but no one out of state accepts mine. I'd be okay being in debt forever if I could get the surgery still.
I have Kaiser. When discussing potential surgery my doctor and HR department both warned me I would probably get a bill for the full amount while the coverage processed. It is apparently more likely on some types of coverage codes. They said I can an probably should call and confirm if action is required on my part.
To be honest, I don't know what's wrong within US, but healthcare and lots of things cost too much. Thou should move to Europe. And about the payments, make sure everything is clear, like there's nothing hidden. If you need it, you may have to ask a lawyer about any struggles you find, or if you need it, talk with your bank, they might be able to help you. I hope everything works well, and never give up.
This is so helpful actually. From some other comments I‚Äôm starting to think it is an anesthesiologist bill and I do live in America. Do you know if this law if federal?
Thank you! I‚Äôll try that.
This. Call the insurance company about your bill.  Insurance companies don‚Äôt send you bills, the providers do. Insurance companies send you explanations of benefits to say ‚Äúhey there, this is what the provider is billing us. This is how we‚Äôve negotiated down their bill for you. This is what we think you owe based on your insurance plan. If it doesn‚Äôt look right, let us know.‚Äù So, in this case, it doesn‚Äôt look right. Call them and ask. The doc could have billed incorrectly. Insurance companies get well deserved flak, but in billing situations, they should be on your side. Your insurance premium pays to have them negotiate on your behalf with doctors, like your car insurance premium pays for your defense if you get into an accident.
This! ^
It's so unfair how insurance can just write shit off like that. I got billed ~$300 each for two COVID tests, called my insurance company and went off on them. They called up the testing place to settle up, and since their maximum amount they pay for COVID tests was $100, they paid $100 for each test and wrote the rest off. So if I'd paid out of pocket I would've owed $600, but my insurance company only paid $200 because that's what they wanted. And republican lawmakers have the nerve to lie to our faces that single payer would cost the individual more.
AGREED! I paid out of pocket in 2013 at one of the TOP transgender surgeons in San Fransisco and only paid 9k!

Thats just fucking rediculious if a cost.
That‚Äôs what I was thinking! Thank you so much
I‚Äôm not sure? I‚Äôll check when I get home tho.
Depends on the state I believe.
Yep. So sue them.
Yep.
Personally up till this bill I‚Äôve had great care with them for my transition! As soon as I started seeking out trans care they set me up with a gender therapist (she‚Äôs great) and I saw her a few times before they let me start testosterone. And I was able to get my chest reduction the year I asked to do it and the surgeon did a terrific job. But I‚Äôve heard other stories about Kaiser being transphobic so I think it really just depends.
Yeah their was no dew date on the bill so I might end up doing this if all else fails.
800+ dollars is I think what she said
No the $800 is my rent lol.
That the point here. 

Its that OP was told they would only have to pay x amount of momey for the procedure, which they did. Then several months later, receive another bill for x amount of money significantly more than was told, AFTER paying the initial amount.

What is even more suspicious is the charge before insurance. $55k for a breast reduction?  When the average cost of a reduction is 5.5k and a double mastectomy maxes at 10k. So something super wack is going on here.
I'm not 100% sure if it will apply to a procedure that happened before the law went into effect, but it might if they sent you the bill after the law came into effect, and I think it at the very least it should hopefully give you a good argument to contest the charge.

My ex broke her arm while we were on vacation and when we got back her insurance company had sent us a bill for $30,000 saying that the surgery wasn't covered. Long story short she spent a whole day in tears on the phone with the insurance company being told she definitely had to pay and eventually made it through 7 supervisors. The first 6 said there was absolutely nothing they could do and that she would have to pay. The seven supervisor apologized and said it was their policy to try to shake their customers down and deny claims. They have no basis in policy to do so it was just a grab for our money. 

I don't know if you're dealing with the same thing with your insurance company but I wish you luck, peace and patience as you fight this evil industry to have them honor their obligations to you.
This is the total cost of the procedure that the insurance will pay as negotiated with the hospital not a bill as your co pay was 300 or so. Pay nothing now. Request a hospital ombudsman as well from the hospital to get the help you need.
Yep. Complain and they usually find if you can prove they didn‚Äôt do there job that you won‚Äôt have to pay it,
I‚Äôm pretty sure I read something about a federal rule being implemented. I‚Äôll look.
Yep. Sad. This is funny
I really don‚Äôt recommend doing this, OP. America sucks and an unpaid bill like this could tank your credit for years-which can mean getting turned down for loans, etc. I had a friend who thought she paid an ambulance bill only to find out three years later that she couldn‚Äôt get a loan because she had ignored a bill and they sent it to collections. 

Confronting it by calling your insurance company first and escalating if you need to is your best bet. I know this can feel incredibly overwhelming, but it‚Äôs better than the alternative.
 talking about 55k then saysthats thats their whole rent tho
Thank you! I appreciate it.
At that rate, why even bother paying for insurance if they make you foot the bill anyway?
[deleted]
Yep, which is why you keep complaining until you don‚Äôt have to pay for it.
[deleted]
803 dollars for the payment plan is her rent
I haven't worked in medical insurance since 2020, so I don't know about the new law. But I do know that a lot of insurance companies will cover things like an out of network anesthesiologist because you don't have a choice in picking who you want and making sure they are in network. It's like being knocked unconscious and being taken to a hospital that is out of network; you were not able to choose the hospital so it is covered as if it were in network.

You may want to contact your insurance and ask them about the charge and why your responsibility is so high. They may be able to get the claim reprocessed as in network, though you may have to make a fuss about it first. And if they have no record of the claim, it's on the doctor/hospital to file the claim in a timely manner or they eat the cost.
I left the US to live in Canada and I'm never coming back.
Sometimes I think that, but then I think about how much my hrt and doctors visits and dental work cost out of pocket and I feel sad. (Also you get some kinda penalty on taxes without health insurance)
Yep. Plus they insisted that she was the only person who could speak to customer care, even though she was early in recovery from surgery. Coming home to a threatening letter was--in her words--worse than breaking her arm.

F*** Kaiser Permanente.
They sent us a bill. They stated it was not a valid claim, and the bill would be sent to collections if she didn't start a payment plan in 30 days. This was Kaiser Permanente in LA.

my mother thinks transphobia isn't real???	"she's extremely catholic but she doesn't believe that anyone is actually against trans people. according to her, nobody cares.

this is the same person that tried to kick me out of the house when i was a child because she *thought* i was a lesbian. I was dating a guy at the time! i didn't even like girls then!

i bet if i came out to her now she'd get rid of me in a heartbeat. honestly i don't understand her at all. goes out of her way to say all sorts of transphobic junk and then turns around and says that everyone basically accepts trans people anyway. the prime minister in our country is literally trying to pass a bill that lets schools choose not to let queer kids in for ""religious reasons"", and my mother says ""oh that's just one thing it doesn't matter""  
???of course it matters! kids are being denied education for something so trivial, and using *my faith* to justify it! i'm tired of it! every time Christianity comes up in the news or on social media its always because of some transphobic garbage (or just bigotry in general) and it's fucking everywhere!

&#x200B;

i can't go one day without someone talking about how there are laws being passed basically everywhere just to make our lives harder, or how people are joking about us joining the 41% (>!and goddammit at this point I might as well end things and make it 42%!<) or how all trans people wanna surgically massacre children (bloody hell it's hard enough for me as a grown ass adult to get people to stop calling me she, let alone go through any medical procedures for my own sake. even if we did want to surgically change the sex of random children we don't give a shit about it'd be impossible with all the medical gatekeeping there is nowadays.)

&#x200B;

im sick of it all. I wanna give up and just live the rest of my life as a tomboy but i can't help but feel like shit every time I'm called ""she"" or ""girl"". it's such a small thing but it feels disgusting every time. and I can't even blame them for it! i do look like a girl! i do look like a she! and i fucking hate being stuck that way! all these horrible things are happening and i can't do jack shit about it! why the hell are Christians nowadays so obsessed with being the worst people possible? what's the point in going to church every week if you throw everything you hear out the window whenever queer people are involved? there's **nothing** in the bible that condemns our existence, there's **nothing** in our faith that justifies transphobia and being transphobic goes against almost everything Jesus tried to teach us.

&#x200B;

i'm tired of it. i like being Catholic. I do feel at peace when i go to church, when I pray, or when i simply stand in front of a crucifix. i like being trans, i like being unrestrained by gender and being the truest version of myself. my faith and my gender identity are both important parts of who I am, and I wouldn't be *whole* without either. it just sucks that the same people I go to church with are probably praying for me to hang myself because i'm a tranny, and other trans people are probably hoping I'd abandon God, and start siding with the devil (maybe not literally but the memes/jokes I see about gay/trans people partying in hell is so fucking annoying at this point. would it kill people to not encourage the thought that being queer is a sin?)

&#x200B;

i wish i could just tell my mother how scared i am. how tired i am waking up *wrong*, every day. I wish i wasn't afraid of *her*."	"Has she been watching the news?

Best wishes on a safe withdrawal from enemy territory, whenever you can get out.
Sad to say: the catholic church isn't very trans friendly. It's anti-you pretty much. Religion is that way now. Esp in USA. Just keep yourself safe. I get the conflict, but being the real you is far far more important.
Here's what you do

Step 1: Wait for her to say transphobia isn't real

Step 2: Immediately come out

Step 3: Remind her that lying is a sin, and that if she does anything transphobic she is going to hell for lying.
My mom will say something transphobic and straight up afterwards say she's not transphobic and doesn't get why I'm mad at her.

I'm 100% with you mate.
I‚Äôm sorry about your mum. I‚Äôm also trans, queer and Catholic (with nuance). I don‚Äôt see the Church as being a part of that cultural practice anymore. The Church have brought almost no good into the world and continue to intentionally destroy, wherever they go. It‚Äôs frustrating and maybe it‚Äôll change but until then, they‚Äôre coming nowhere near my soul, ye know?
I saw an interview with a high level member of the KKK, and they said they were not racist. Because in their mind what they perceived was truth. 

Everyone knows being homophobic/transphobic/racist is bad. But if someone is indeed one of those, they will deny it, as that label is for evil people. Someone that thinks gays are going to hell and are brainwashing children to abuse them isn't homophobic in their own eyes, as that is reality, and they aren't going out and running gay people over with their truck. 

I've found the best way is to not say ""you are [thing]"", but ""what you said is [thing] because [reason]."" Either they will dig in and defend themselves, or they will listen because they don't want to have that label.
ü´Ç
I‚Äôm so sorry about you mom. People like that just want to believe they‚Äôre soo oppressed and that the world is against everything they‚Äôre for. ‚ÄúI hate trans people but they‚Äôre not illegal so no one else hates them üò°‚Äù is pretty much their mindset but genuinely what do you mean by ‚Äòsurgically massacre children‚Äô?? Wtf do you mean by that?
She is either and idiot or in denial. Either way, an unsafe cis person. I am so sorry.
I've never read the Bible so I won't question you or her on that, but she is definitely wrong if she things that no one hates transpeople. Often times I find men who don't even realize im trans till I tell them then its ""43 percent yourself"" and ""you honestly think you can change your gender? What an idiot"" or ""I feel sorry for your parents id disown my child if they were trans."" It makes having long-term meaningful relationships difficult. Another thing, the 43 percent statistic (that changes depending upon the person amd can be as high as 50 sometimes lol) is only attempts and not actual deaths. I would argue the existence of any systematic discrimination though at least in the United States.
I grew up in a Catholic/Jewish home.  I retain a bit of an affinity with both, but I also see that the failings are so overwhelming that I don‚Äôt feel at home with them.  So, I look forward to seeing my own way of interpreting and it comes down to this:  Compassion is the one commonality that I‚Äôve found in most faiths around the world.  ‚ÄúHungry I was and you fed me, etc.‚Äù  But, all of them also fail at this in one way or another.  If a faith rejects you (and that includes a parent‚Äôs faith) then the faith fails.  If it feeds you then it succeeds.  If it only feeds part of you then you are free to add faiths that feed the empty parts.  

In America and European cultures you seem to be allowed only one religion.  In Asian cultures, such as Japan it seems strange to be so limited.  I draw from as many beliefs as I need to keep my brain from exploding from the bigotry of any of them.  

If you‚Äôre worried about cultural appropriation ask someone from that culture.  If you are respectful, they will understand and offer some accommodation.  I know this from my own mixed racial heritage (European, African and Asian).  I‚Äôm lucky in that my mother was matriarchal in her culture and her parenting, and her children had her blessing to choose their own path.  (I never met my father, but I‚Äôm told that he was an abusive patriarch.)

Just don‚Äôt go where you‚Äôre not invited.  It sounds that the Catholic Church is not inviting, so retain from there what works best for you, and find the welcome that you need in another tradition.

You don‚Äôt need to limit yourself just because other people want to limit you.
onlyread a bit so take with salt.


ask her to take you to church and introduce you. Now your fear is her fear. her discomfort is what you might feel every second.

too many people can't feel what another feels.

Jesus asked everyone to attend his sermons. If a congregation cant make you feel welcome they are doing Christianity wrong. personal opinion.
Remind yourself that the community that supports you is blatantly smarter than the community that doesn't. Take a good look at your allies and then look at your enemies, the people who want you to feel bad are as predictable as actual children, they just kept on developing after childhood with the absence of their judgement. Not your job to educate annoying people, go have fun

I've come to the conclusion over a long time that religion is not compatible with lgbtq people. Religion is built from the ground up as tribalism to exclude everyone that isn't just like you. The ONLY exception I've found is unitarian universalism. I've found many of these churches are very accepting. My local UU church has a lesbian preacher. It's still kinda iffy though, but it's the closest to being friendly
Right when you get the chance, move. Do a lot of research and emigrate. I know this is big, but America isn‚Äôt that bad for me. I‚Äôm 13 and FTM trans in a public middle school. Sometimes I wanna shoot [anonymous] and punt [anonymous2], but other than that, I love it here. Just don‚Äôt be in Texas or the other transphobic states. Virginia is where I‚Äôm at, it‚Äôs probably got the most redneck Christians here, but thank god I‚Äôm a minor and they‚Äôre all angry dads in their mid 40s. As long as you‚Äôre not in your mid 40s too, it‚Äôll probably be fine. You could start over in America and only your doctors would know you‚Äôre one of us.
>Has she been watching the news?

Yeah... Fox News. ü§¶üôÑ
Some churches are trans friendly. Some churches are tolerant. The majority are not, and the Catholic church especially is not.
Because to people with intolerance the label is a step worse than them in their mind. A racist person will say they aren't racist, because what they think to them is truth or they aren't burning crosses in people's front yards.

my mother blamed my gender identity on videogames.	"So title pretty much says it all, I've (21 trans-fem) been telling my mother that I felt uncomfortable as a lad, and that I wanted to transition for over a year. Today my therapist took a chat with my mom telling her that if she didn't take me to a clinic then he would.

I love my mom, but she doesn't understand. She's generally really accepting but I've always struggled with mental health and my mother has been blaming it on my gaming (which isn't even that extreme), I'm planning to move back out as I can't handle her micro-managing my life, but with the current bills n stuff I can't afford to."	"Video games are always at fault. Did you know that Hitler played Castle Wolfenstein as a child? It explains so much.
Try to convince her that estrogen will make you less interested in videogames!
How would a video game change your gender?  I‚Äôm confused.
My mother once thought it was partly because of anime lmao
The argument that Games are the root of all things in one's life makes no sense and I still have no clue how they all come to the same conclusion.
My parents also tried to use every possible explanation for my gender dysphoria *except* me being trans. My mom thought I just didn't want to be gay (surprise, I'm actually ace). My dad was convinced for months that I was just lonely and needed to find a partner (again, I'm ace). It took me becoming visibly happier and more motivated by actively pursuing social transition for them to finally get on my side.
ITS BECAUSE OF THAT BLOODY PHONE!!! I'm sorry I had to but i thought these kinda parents were just in memes, sorry she's not supporting tho :\
Parents will come up with any excuse. My mom said it's because my dad wasn't in my life or that it's because they did drugs in the 80s ( not while my mom was preggers) or that it's because the women in a relationship have a lot of power again this is before the Internet was super accessible this was the dial up era and the DSL era when online was not really big yet. My dad thinks it's cause I've never had sex my mom's ex husband would probably have said that it's because before my mom married him I was raised by women.
tbf, theres a suspicious amount of transwomen who like Fallout: New Vegas
thats so strange to me, there's SOOO many cis men that have zero gender-related problems or even really curiosities.

its also just such a weird disconnect to me- like oh you wanna be a girl thats because you dont get enough exercise and dont like your body because of too much gaming! like wtf ???
Violent = video games. Gay = video games.  Trans.  well it must be the video games fault.
I audibly laughed at the headline
You're 21 and struggling and your mom can't possibly imagine that you're old enough to figure things out and make important decisions?

Just read the title of your post, but, I'm now hearing that anime is making people trans.

Ya hear the words UwU and that's it your trans forever.
You should tell her she's a moron that doesn't understand the difference between cause and effect.

You play games excessively because you want to dissociate because your real life is not something that you want, and that's the case because you're trying (and failing) to live your life as the wrong gender.
My dad blames it on my mom being a woman. He seems to think that because I live with a woman that's somehow the reason I'm trans. He also seems to think that having cats made me think I'm a cat (I just like cats and think its cute and fun to act catlike).
I played GTAV once when I was 12 and now I‚Äôm a full time criminal gang banger and night club owner
Omfg I feel the same way. My mom thinks that video games are a boy thing and she hates that I play them (I‚Äôm ftm)
Just wait till you hear weed and smoke rap music.
WTF kind of QAnon conspiracy is this? Girls don‚Äôt play video games, how would video games turn you trans-fem? Everyone knows it‚Äôs immoral women working careers and wearing pants giving their children the wrong idea about gender. If they just stayed home and raised their children and greeted their hard-working husband with a kiss while wearing a cocktail dress and holding a pot roast we wouldn‚Äôt have all these radical leftists saying gender isn‚Äôt real.
for all us trans people out there, if you wanna get rid of dysphoria, just stop playing call of duty ü§°

Hmmm, let's see, I knew I was supposed to be a girl at a very young age. I also started playing video games at a young age. But if I look at the games I was playing when I became aware that I didn't feel like a boy, then I *should* identify as...

Anime and video games transing all the kids (and this 40 year old too).
Anime did make me realize I was Trans. My obsession with gender bender stuff made me realize I wanted that to happen to me
I've never understood that argument. If anime was turning kids trans then we should have an epidemic of trans kids in Japan stretching all the way back to the 1960s. But the rate of trans people in Japan is roughly the same as other countries worldwide.
Every generation of parents chooses something prevalent among the next generation to blame on in order not to acknowledge their own negligence and ignorance on their children.
They try to make scapegoats out of things they have no frame of reference for and are often outside their generational understanding. Games are just a common low hanging fruit. It's often seen as a juvenile activity and easy to demonize and pin blame on for something completely irrelevant.
I know right, parents. üôÑ

And [Lucy Hicks Anderson](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucy_Hicks_Anderson) was famously corrupted and turned trans by playing too much Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild.
I realized I only liked football because of the hanging out with people, drinking, and eating food part. Although I moved across the country so nobody likes the same team as I do so that kinda contributed to that loss of interest too. I still love basketball though and watch that even if it's on my own!
Oh growing up with my parents I had to learn to be the loophole queen.
Ah yes the perfect solution to wanting to be a woman: exercising so you look even more stereotypically masculine
Nah, I exercise more since transitioning because I'm more interested in keeping my body healthy.
That sounds a lot like my parents telling me ""You just need to get off the couch go outside get some fresh air and sunshine"" when I told them I had severe depression and was suicidal. \^\^ To them I was just lazy.  
Some people just have no way to relate to things like that sadly.
Honestly since being true to myself I've not lost interest in gaming but I have found myself taking better care of my body. Just that little change in my mindset and I've lost 12lbs in the last 2 weeks by just taking better care of myself.
oh my god me too lmao
üòÜüòÜüòÜ
It's not even that I don't \*like\* video games anymore.  It's more like I just don't \*need\* to play them like I used to, because I'm able to prioritize things that matter more to me.
I dunno, exercise even when I was closeted made me feel better about certain aspects of me. Not how my body looks per se, but how my body feels, and how I can more easily impact change in my environment and such. It's definitely made me feel better overall as a person, and now I have some lean muscle, nothing too bulky.
Came here to say that I exercise and I still want to transition I'm 34 years old and I want a toned fem body but I also play video games I workout regularly to Chloe Ting videos and they kick your ass.
Nintendo is behind it all!
Very true, it's something that makes me feel better about myself also. Just more poking fun at them wanting to be a woman so her mother is like be a swole guy instead like it's the same thing haha."	umycxh	trans	555	0.98	2022-05-11 01:38:27
My friend died	"No one I know really cares so the most that I've been able to do today is scream into my pillow. I was her only friend. We met at a support group for trans people, and she was great help in keeping that group running. She was in school to become a nurse because she loved helping people. She was an avid reader and could go on for hours about stories she enjoyed. 

I knew *her.* Her family manufactured an identity for her and tried to force her into the role. To them, she is a boy who studied to become a software engineer (she started that but abandoned it when she started her transition) and knew everything about computers (she was not, she only googled tech problems). If you asked her parents, they'd claim she was a movie buff(she hated movies but watched them as a child to appease her parents). Today, their social media is spammed with sympathy, but it all uses the wrong name and wrong pronouns because none of them cared who she actually was. 

She wanted, above so much else, to one day be accepted by her family. When she came out to them she was thrown out of the home she grew up in and allowed back only if she detransitioned. They mocked her chosen name and refused to call her ""she."" But she was convinced that one day she'd be able to educate them enough and that they would welcome her back, that they would view her as a daughter and a sister. 

She went home for the holidays this year, which was the first time she'd been home in years. Her parents wanted to see her, and she thought it was a sign of progress. I encouraged her to go, even drove her to the airport. She came home miserable. No progress had been made - they wanted her home because they wanted to drag her to church and convince her to return to the  faith. She spent two weeks with people who denied and spat on her true self. 

And last night she killed herself. 

I have done nothing today except doomscroll social media. Her family mourns a name she didn't use, they plaster their profiles with pictures from before her transition, they claim they miss her and love her and don't mention the fact that they made her homeless for months because she had the audacity to be born in the wrong body. 

No one else in our support group really knew her. She rarely spoke at our meetings. I informed them of her death and they can only offer empty sympathies. 

I don't know what to do anymore. Society is regressing backwards and we suffer for it. A large segment of people out there don't want us to exist and will do all they can to hurt us. I'm so tired of it. Tired of my support group growing smaller as the months pass, tired of waking up to headlines about some fascist somewhere proposing a bill to strip away our rights."	"Thank you for telling her story.
It sounds like you were a true friend to her, and that's what we really need in this life. I am incredibly sorry to hear about your loss, unfortunately as I didn't know ow them, all I can do is add to the pile for sympathy. Just know that while she was having issues, you were like a lighthouse in a storm to her
That‚Äôs so fucked up and honestly I would go so far as to say with the context that it wasn‚Äôt just that she killed herself, that her family pushed her to suicide. Her death is on their hands and then they‚Äôre trying to seem like victims. I‚Äôm not surprised, but that‚Äôs really heartbreaking. I‚Äôm sorry you‚Äôre going through this but I know that you will honor her life well.
Its good you wrote this down, expressing your frustrations and feelings. At least that is what my therapist tells me. 

We are all in this together. So sorry for you loss and wish you the best.
Those parents need a punch in their noses so hard ü§¨
No one can blame you for being distraught over this avoidable suicide. Her family will continue to live in denial over their lack of suooort. It‚Äôs great she had such a great friend in you and the support group. It was probably her biggest blessing. I am truly sorry for your loss of such a great friend. You were obviously very supportive and affirming. Such a gift. Sharing her story might just give insight to others who read this. It might produce something very positive for another family. Thank you for sharing. I do hope you will hold soace for self-care as you morn this terrible loss. Prayers for peace and comfort for you and her support group. I wish I could give you a Mom hug. My heart breaks for those who knew and loved her for who she really was. You were a true and great friend. I do hope you will take care of yourself in this painful loss.
Religion is a cancer on this planet. I'm sorry for your loss.
They killed their child
Your friend didn't kill herself. She was murdered by the hate of her ""family"". All it would have took to save her is for them to love her. They obviously couldn't do that and now she's gone. It's their fault. I would tell them that. 

I'm sorry for your loss.
If you can, separate yourself from your phone and computer for a while. Looking at all that stuff is going to keep you in a bad cycle. You‚Äôre vulnerable right now, allow yourself to take a step back and just do what you need to do to grieve. If not for yourself but for her, because you can honor her memory. So please make sure to eat, drink water, get some sleep if you can, ask for help from people you are close to. Do this so you can fight for her memory and fight for progress to help prevent this from happening again. For what it‚Äôs worth even thought we didn‚Äôt know her we can mourn her together
I‚Äôm heartbroken for her, and feel your pain and suffering. I have nothing to offer but sympathy and condolences. You are a true hero to her and I thank you for sharing her story. Please take care of yourself, you‚Äôre a great person!
I‚Äôm so sorry, this is an honest tragedy. You sound like a great person and i‚Äôm sure you managed to ease some of the pain your friend felt at certain points in her life. 

It‚Äôs good you can get your thoughts out, as painful as they might be, because that often helps us process traumatic events. Hopefully you can carry on your friend‚Äôs memory, she seemed like an incredibly sweet person. 

I can‚Äôt believe the audacity of her family. One of my fears is being misgendered and deadnamed after I‚Äôm dead. I finally changed my legal name, but still, most of my family doesn‚Äôt know. Your friend‚Äôs family seems terrible and the fake concern they show after your friend‚Äôs death is an insult the the beautiful person I‚Äôm sure she was. I can‚Äôt help but think they won‚Äôt even ever recognize the damage they caused. 

Please take care of yourself. The world is a grim place but I hope you find comfort eventually. The pain of a loss like that will never leave. I hope you can find a way to grieve and honor your friend. Sending hugs and well wishes
Could you maybe submit her real obituary somewhere? My worst fear is dying with nobody acknowledging who I am.
Her blood is on their hands. They chose to push the ~~‚Äúson‚Äù~~ they never had instead of loving and cherishing the *daughter* they always had and that lead to the loss of her life. I hope they realize that someday and feel absolutely ashamed and disgusted by themselves and their actions!

Their daughter will live on in our hearts! <3
Sorry for your loss :(
I'm so sorry for your loss.
Thank you for sharing her memory. She won‚Äôt be forgotten here.
She'll always live on in are hearts because you were able to tell the story of her, and even if others try to hide it, we'll always know the person she was. I'm so sorry for your loss, I hope you recover and feel better as time goes on <3
Say her name üíî fly high sis... R.i.p
It's sad and heartbreaking, the family is responsible and has no remorse and don't even seem to notice.
Completely different circumstances, but I‚Äôve lost two friends to suicide as well, one during highschool and I would overhear a few people talking poorly of him and making assumptions even though they never knew him. Another was a few years ago. It‚Äôs heart wrenching, I wish I could offer more to comfort you. If you aren‚Äôt already, try seeking a therapist or someone to talk to about it
Thank you for sharing that part of her with us. <3
I‚Äôm so fucking sorry for your friend. That story broke my heart, she sounded like an amazing woman. Thank you for sharing your story. Losing someone is never easy ü´Ç
She didn't kill herself, her ignorant and frankly morally bankrupt fucking parents drove her to that point. 

Imagine having the fucking GALL to post your child after they pass away, not even having the decency to respect who they were even in death. I'd argue its fucking evil. 

You did the absolute best you could for her and I bet she always cherished what you guys had. I'm so sorry you've gotta deal with this to start your new year. I'm available if you need to talk with somebody.
I am so sorry for your loss. You sound like you were a great friend to her
May she rest in peace, no longer having to endure the pain and frustration of other people‚Äôs ignorance and hatred. She deserves so much better from her family but she does have one real friend and now her trans community knows and will mourn her too with you. R.I.P to one of our butterflies.
Do you mind telling me her name? I‚Äôve got a friend, an ex really, whose parents berated him for his orientation until he couldn‚Äôt take it anymore. I was in the room. He was the first person I loved, and the first person close to me to die. I still write letters to him, and hope that there‚Äôs an afterlife of some sort where he sees them. I try to tell him the others I‚Äôve lost to this and hope he can help them or show them to someone who can. I know it‚Äôs probably all nonsense, but I have to believe there‚Äôs something after this, that the victims of this bullshit get some justice, get the peace they deserve. I don‚Äôt know if any of that is the case, and I strongly doubt all of it is, but I do know that I‚Äôm running out of patience. Every time I close my eyes, I see him. I haven‚Äôt gotten a full night‚Äôs sleep since it happened and I‚Äôm not even the one who actually went through it, I just saw it happen. I can‚Äôt accept that there‚Äôs no justice for what he‚Äôs suffered, but there‚Äôs nothing I can do for him now. So I write him letters and hope.
Stories like these make me seeth with both rage and sorrow. Have people no compassion?? Thank you for telling her story, losing people is never easy, especially when it could‚Äôve been so easily prevented by people that are supposed to love their child unconditionally.
Thank you for sharing her story. 
If I may give a few words to her:
Though her family was not supportive or kind to her throughout her transition, we in the trans community understand and feel her pain. We know what it‚Äôs like to be repressed, censored, told we‚Äôre hideous, exaggerated for being trans, among many other things. Today we mourn in honor of her. She was a person who, like many of us face the daily struggle of being trans, and even being closeted for some of us (me included). All she wanted was love and acceptance, like we all do. We are only asking for the basic right of respect and dignity. We only ask to be treated equally, with love and kindness. Too many trans people have been lost in this journey. Too many of our fellow trans sisters, brothers, siblings have we lost. Here‚Äôs to a more cheerful, hopeful future. One where we can finally be accepted, and may learn to love each other. May this unfortunate circumstance serve to us as a reminder that you are not exaggerating when asking to use the correct pronouns. You are not going through a phase. You don‚Äôt need to ‚Äúatone for your sins‚Äù for being trans. Yes you are trans enough, yes you are just as valid as cis people, yes you deserve love. I‚Äôm currently crying as we speak and mourn for your friend today. As a side note to this , I had a fight with my cis friend because he still doesn‚Äôt fully use my preferred pronouns. I thought to myself I was exaggerating and being dramatic because I felt quite invalidated for being seen as a just a man. I am an AMAB nonbinary person who use he/she/they pronouns. This message given to us by the OP reminds us that yes it‚Äôs valid to feel hurt by people not using our pronouns and deadnaming us. I am very sorry for your friend, she deserved better. Thank you again for sharing this with us and hopefully sharing this has given even a little bit of closure
I say copy your very eloquent post to the profiles of the family who rejected her. Sure, they're happy to lie to themselves but deep down they know. I'd ask myself what I had to lose by sticking up for her even at this point. Especially at this point. I'm so so sorry.
She sounds like she was an incredible woman who loves more for others in need than for her self. Why is it that the best of us seem to leave so soon? The world is blind to the bright light that people like her being and it is tragic. Thank you for sharing, at least her memory lives on in you and the story that you shared here.
I am so sorry this was done to her. Thank you for sharing her story
My deepest condolences for your loss, she sounds like an incredible person by the way you describe her. This may sound like empty words from someone who doesn't know you and didn't knew her, but I just want to say that even though there are many people mourning for someone who was not her, as long as there are people like you who will remember and mourn her for who she truly was, then I believe she is able to live on through you. She may be gone but she will never be truly forgotten because she had you who will always have known who she was. You're a good friend, thank you so much for sharing her story with us.
I'm so sorry for your loss, thank you for sharing her story. Sending you love x
Im so sorry for your loss, she seemed like a great woman. I'm sure she'd want you to keep fighting, to not get dragged down by the terrors of this world, it's why she wanted to be a nurse, and why she helped in the support group. Take a step back, take the time you need to grieve, but also cherish your memories. Cherish your friendship with her, the fun you had, her interests, her genuine self. Her wicked family may only remember their son, but you will remember their daughter.
Don't let her true story be covered by the fake one that her family made.
Could you post something on her social media that tells people what really happened? So it doesn't gets lost in time?
I am sorry that she died.
So sorry for your loss.
Sorry for your loss.
I literally cried reading this. I want to share my condolences üíê this is a tough read and I can‚Äôt bear the thought of what she wells thinking in the time of events. I can‚Äôt imagine it but it sounds so familiar to me because I‚Äôm a trans woman too and I hate to talk about myself in this segment but I noticed that people really are innately selfish to point of outing trans people as if literally taking away their human rights! It‚Äôs downright disgusting. Sometimes, I don‚Äôt want to live but I don‚Äôt think I have the guts to take it that far considering how bad people can be, but even worst family members. 

It‚Äôs sucks doesn‚Äôt it? We live and then after all the effort and shit we‚Äôve been through we thought life gets better‚Ä¶ but it doesn‚Äôt really? People will always try to bring each other down like crabs in a bucket. 

We live a dog eats dog society. When you‚Äôre trans the dumbasses stood out more for some reason.

Once again, thanks again for sharing her story and you will get through this. God doesn‚Äôt judge. People do.
Not a trans person myself, but one of my best friends is & is also dealing with a family that isn't very supportive of her. All I can do is give you as big a hug as I can. You did the absolute right thing by sharing her story, you're a true friend. I wish everyone in your friend's life was as supportive as you are.
Her story will be told by me secondhand for the love and drive she had. 

I will tell of a girl of great strength and determination. Compassion and empathy. 

She will live on through your tellings, of saying her name in the darkness, the early morn, the bright sunlight.

You know her truth, and you know her soul. Keep her alive in thought and memories. Tell of her to others, and it's as if they met her too. Stay strong dear, she still stands beside us as we move forward through our lives. ‚ô°
Don't have the words to tell how sorry I feel for her and for you nor how angry I am at her ""family"". Stay safe, take care of yourself, hope you have good friends around to support you <3
im so sorry for your loss. thank you for telling us about her
Poor girl... How her death wasn't an incredibly late wake-up call is just so sad. She doesn't deserve this...
[deleted]
My heart breaks reading this :( rip poor baby. What makes my blood boil, is that these shit stains she called a family, will never realize it was their bullshit that killed her. like they would even care. Theres a special place in hell for these pieces of trash. Sorry‚Ä¶ im furious >.>
Well, that's just wrong on so many levels, what her family did. Thank you for sharing and I'm so sorry for your loss. U nerd a hug. *hugs*
Thank you for sharing her story. She will never be forgotten üíú
I‚Äôm so sorry üòû
I am horrified and terribly sorry for your loss. We really need true friends in life, and you were a true friend to her.

Parents like that make me so angry.
I am so so sorry for her loss, maybe try and find people from her school that knew her maybe make some sort of group. The world has lost a wonderful person and her life being cut short was truly a tragedy. Also remember to take care of yourself, I‚Äôve been told the worst day isn‚Äôt the day they die because at least you have something to do, it‚Äôs all the days they stay dead so make sure your healthy and ok. I am so sorry for you loss.
I am so sorry for your loss. You knew the real her, telling her story is the best way to remember her. Thank you for sharing her story with us. Please stay safe friend.
The best you can do is keep her memory alive. we all have to fight to improve the world for future trans people.
Condolences for your loss. Thanks for sharing. If anything ever happened to me, I‚Äòd wish my friends would somehow tell my truth as well somewhere. That way we‚Äòre remembered at least by our communities as who we really are.
I‚Äôm so sorry for your loss üíï
They didn‚Äôt deserve her. I am so sorry for your loss.
I'm so sorry, that's absoloutly horrible. I understand not being understood by family and them outright just not accepting me, thankfully they are getting better though.

I wish you the best, and I just know that spreading her story as much as you can, is what she would've wanted you do.

This horrific violence committed to our community needs to stop, all these laws and shit are just a mass genocide.

It makes me so sad everyday to know that we have to deal with ignorant people who have such a problem being educated and just saying he instead of she, she instead of he, or they.

To me that's not a hard concept, but to them it seems like the end of the world to respect someone's wishes, and it can end in someone dying.

Wishing you the best, I'm really sorry and I hope she can get her story heard by the people who were deadnamimg her (not on purpose)
Im sorry you lost your friend, thank you for sharing her story.
I love you all
I am so sorry for your loss and wish you well in your goals moving forward will be hard I know if you ever need someone to lean on I will always be there for you in anyway I am capable
You‚Äôre a great friend and I will say that despite everything she‚Äôs still with you. Her rebellious and caring for others spirit is within you - never let that go away

Please, make a memorial for HER not the bullshit the parents will came up with. You know her true self and she would be happy to know she didn‚Äôt left us without being memorized for who she actually is

I can‚Äôt imagine the pain you‚Äôre going through, but I beg you to never back down. They want us to be hopeless and suicidal, but we will always prevail with caring people like you, be a light that will warmly hug someone in the darkest moments 

Thank you for being a true friend
You expressed what i felt reading this even better than i could...
Oh i think they deserve a little more than that ü§¨ üò°üòí
I second this
Religion is not a cancer. It can give hope when needed, an answer to believe when there are none from science. But weaponized religion, like what we see with so many Christians and Muslims, and assuredly many more faiths, are what plague this Earth. They enforce their own absolutes onto others, they allow their faith to judge someone before they can get a chance to. They drive people that their religion educators tell them they should hate or convert to suicide, like what's happened here. Christianity is the worst in historical measures; they've used their faith to excuse an extraordinary number of moral and ethical crimes. Hell, they built the United States on these crimes. And now, people weaponize their religion for hatred and discrimination of minorities of all kinds. These people are ethe plague on this Earth. 

This one story gives light to the many, many stories of other victims who have fallen prey to weaponized religion. It's sad to know of one person, one life cut short by discrimination. It's sickening to know that's it's not just that one life.

I cannot offer any words other than empty sympathies for this loss. I did not know her, though by OP's description she sounded like an amazing person with a really shitty family. Live on in her honor and memory, tell her story as much as you can as to give her a legacy.

As a note, I'm sorry if I have said anything upsetting. I wanted to voice my opinion and give condolences but I am painfully bad at reading what may or may not be appropriate for any situation.
Agreed. Pushing one's own child to suicide should count as a form of murder.

Gov. Who Signed Anti-Trans Bill Stumped On Why LGBTQ+ People Are Depressed		"It could be a saturday morning cartoon, if it wasn't actually happening all over the world
Hmm... Well I wonder why people that are constantly dealing with transphobia, homophobia, being constantly attacked, having their rights be debated on by cishet politicians are depressed? What is the reason??
Hmmm why would people who are constantly attacked, belittled and ridiculed as well as having their rights frequently in danger be depressed ü§îü§îü§î

i just stabbed myself in the foot, why does my foot hurt
The most insincere ""I don't know. That makes me sad, and we should figure it out,"" followed by silence. She could have saved a few breaths by not answering the question and still portraying the exact same thing.
Woah, this is real? I thought this was a headline from The Onion at first!
She‚Äôs evil and depraved.
Hmm I wonder
Some people forgot about ""hypocrisity"" word
[removed]
huh now why would people who are constantly antagonised and oppressed and mocked be depressed and anxious? wow we may never know /s
It won't surprise me if she pursues further anti-LGBTQ+ legislation by claiming that being a sexual or gender minority makes people depressed. I somewhat expect ""90% of youth who say they're LGBT are depressed, so we should limit information about that lifestyle"" to become part of her agenda.
Wow. Just wow.

Yeah, a total ""Oh no! ...Anyways...""
I wonder, what could it possibly be. 
In this bigoted, transphobic/homophobic, prejudiced country- what ever could be making the LGBTQ+ community so depressed?
If only the corrupt and discriminator ""leaders""- who *so* very *clearly* understand their citizens- could figure it out... 

The US and everything these hyper-conservative capitalist pricks stand for is just a fucking joke.
But let her votes on next election start dwindling and watch who changes their tune... no one voted for you? Why are you upset
She is the future of the republican party.  She is gunning for the presidency I think.
How are people who are this stupid allowed in government. Like genuinely I could be a better governer than this and I'm 15 üò≠üò≠

Well, people have to hide who they really are for their own safety
Crazy, I wonder ü§î
When I saw this I knew it was gonna be her. She gives my state a bad reputation
What bill?
""why are the people we're oppressing so depressed they live in America the greatest country on earth it's not like they live in North Korea where they're oppressed and depressed"" this bitch probably
She probably never questioned a thing in her life, just followed the trail of the next lemming, and believes what She is feed from her leaders...

A simple pawn among the poly (many) tics (insects)

I wonder how she would feel if she saw a face app picture of herself as a man?

Not like it and see what we feel?
Like it and know what we feel?
Laugh and still have no clue?

Tis sad she can't see things from a different perspective! She should not judge a person that she has not walked in their shoes!  
     I'd would be ironic if one of her family members ended up being trans...
*scarcasm* the world may never know
It's a GOD DAMN MYSTERY!!!
It must be because of who we are! It can‚Äôt possibly be related to the oppression
I shot someone else's foot because I don't like them...why are they complaining?
It's funny.  I read the quote multiple times, but all I heard was ""fuck them queers""
I tried posting it to nottheonion but the mods there do not like me.
Unfortunately she my governor. Unfortunately she represents how most of my state feels. Here in the mid west homophobia/transphobia is common and cheered upon. She is ass backwards and needs to go, but I don't really see that happening.
But wouldn't fascists hate degenerates since a big part of silly mustache man's book about degeneracy and how it destroys the moral fabric of society which is true but that's coming from someone who openly admits to being a sexual deviant and degenerate and wears it proudly the most morally bankrupt societies are the most free and the most fun
Being a sexual and gender minority does make you depressed because we're too ""different"" kinda like how queer people are disproportionately neurodivergent compared to cishets or default settings people if you don't like cishet because apparently there's people that don't think tranny is an awful word but think we shouldn't call them cishet
No, evil.
I know it's almost like there's a connection between oppression and depression but no that can't be true if that was the case no one in America would be depressed because its the land of the free (in case you don't know the irony there is the ""land of the free"" has more people locked up than any other country on earth including China who is very well known for respecting people's rights and totally not persecuting Muslims""
Totally
She is also my governor. Hate her
Nope, sorry. Fascists are the degenerates they're the ones who are projecting.
It's the way other people often treat us that leads to higher rates of depression and anxiety. Politicians like Kristi Noem claim that it's something *inherent* *to being LGBTQ+* that makes us experience higher rates of mental illness. We know from research that you can drastically reduce or even eliminate the risk of poor mental health in gender and sexual minority people by fostering accepting environments.

[Action Alert] Help us prevent trans-exclusionary bathroom laws in the UK!	"#Call to action

**Content Note: Discussion of Transphobia, Bathroom Bills, and mention of transphobic assaults and sexual assault.**

The current UK Conservative government, in their infinite wisdom, has decided to turn their attentions towards a nagging desire to inspect the genitals of those using public toilets. Now, you might well wonder why the government is concerned with toilets right now, given the COVID death toll in this country just passed 100,000, but that is the situation as we see it right now.

See the full call for evidence here - [Toilet provision for men and women: call for evidence](https://www.gov.uk/government/consultations/toilet-provision-for-men-and-women-call-for-evidence)

Now, obviously, these sorts of laws are based on the misconception that cis men will claim to be trans women in order to assault cis women in public toilets. This basically never happens. However, what they do is give transphobes a pretext to police transgender people's use of public toilets.

This puts Trans Women at huge risk; there is both anecdotal and criminal evidence, that many trans and gender-nonconforming people have been sexually assaulted ‚Äî and thousands more harassed and insulted ‚Äî by people who find out that they‚Äôre trans. Sometimes, that harassment happens in restrooms. Without an anti-discrimination law, trans people live with the constant threat of being ejected from public restrooms ‚Äî or worse.

The implications for trans men are huge as well. Instead of making cis women comfortable and safe, these laws put trans men at risk of reprisals from people angry about ""the pervert in the women's toilets.""

**What we are seeing here is a cynical attack on some of the most vulnerable people in the UK in order to distract from a catastrophically bungled response to the pandemic.**

While the issue is now being used primarily against trans people, historically bathroom fears have been regularly deployed against civil rights causes. It was used against black people to justify segregation ‚Äî by invoking fears that black men would attack white women in bathrooms. And it was used to stop the Equal Rights Amendment in the United States, which tried to establish legal equality between men and women, because opponents claimed it would lead to the abolition of bathrooms for different genders, potentially putting women in danger.

British Redditors, we are all going to submit evidence to this inquiry saying ""Actually, we don't want the government policing who gets to use which toilets."" Redditors from other countries, you are going to signal boost this so as many people see it as possible.

Email toilets@communities.gov.uk (yes really) using the [email template](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cZ4Vw4rfVV2GqF4y3cToIHApxGhpoop38x8FTwkGj0c/) provided by @WeExistLondon on Twitter.

The Mods wish to thank u/delta_baryon in r/MensLib who first highlighted [this Action Alert](https://www.reddit.com/r/MensLib/comments/lbni41/action_alert_help_us_prevent_transexclusionary/)."	"There's still no active way they can police it even if it is made law, which makes it doubly stupid.
But let's say it does happen and is actively policed somehow, I just hope the anti trans women who voted for it are excited to have transgender men using the ladies toilets.

You know, with body hair and beards...
Here's the Email Template for Mobile Users üíô

To whom it may concern,

I am a [e.g nonbinary person / trans person /
cis man / cis woman) and after reading the
recent technical consultation on ‚ÄòToilets for
men and women' I am utterly compelled to
contact you.

This consultation is a direct and violent
attack on transgender and Gender Non-Conforming (GNC) people's basic human
rights.

There is no evidence that cisgender people
face increased violence in gender-neutral
toilet facilities. However, we do have
evidence that almost half of trans people
(48%) don't feel comfortable using
public toilets, as a result of verbal abuse,
intimidation, and physical assault (LGBT in
Britain Trans Report, Stonewall UK, 2018).
The policing of gender in toilets is a wasteful
use of government funds, serving to draw
unwarranted attention to a political and
prejudicial debate' resulting from a wider
climate of transphobia in the UK.

As stated in the consultation: 'The Equality
Act provides that sex, age, disability,
and gender reassignment are protected
characteristics.' I would like to highlight
that the Equality Act of 2010 also serves to
protect those who are discriminated against because they are wrongly perceived to be
trans (including many Black women, butch
women and lesbians, GNC people, and
intersex people), many of whom face abuse
and discrimination due to a combination of
racism and gender policing, and therefore
rely on gender neutral toilets as a safer
alternative. 

Whilst this is not yet in the
Equality Act, GNC and nonbinary people
(including disabled nonbinary people) should
also be entitled to gender-neutral toilets, or to
their personal preference of gendered facility.
The consultation also states that ""Women
need safe spaces given their particular
health and sanitary needs (for example,
women who are menstruating, pregnant or
at menopause)"". This statement completely
excludes the experience of trans men,
intersex people and GNC people who
menstruate / are pregnant / at menopause.

The government's continued erasure of
already marginalized groups of people serves
to reiterate the inequality in distribution
of public resources privileging cisgender
people.

As a [eg. nonbinary person] I have never,
ever felt unsafe or at risk from being in
gender-neutral toilet spaces.

[Please feel free to add personal experience here]

The consultation states that you want to
ensure that everyone is fairly served. I urge
you to take seriously the negative effects
that the removal of gender-neutral toilets will
have on the following groups - Black women,
lesbian / butch women, trans and nonbinary
people, GNC people, and disabled trans
people - all of whom experience adverse
levels of violence due to the effects of
gender policing, and the compounded effect
of racism, which threatens many women of
colour due to racist ideas of femininity.

So I urge you not to remove gender neutral
toilets. These spaces are not only safe
but absolutely vital in the protection of so
many people's basic human rights. These
spaces simply must not be taken away from
marginalised groups of people who already
face disproportionate levels of violence and
abuse.

It is apparent that through this consultation
the government has aligned itself with
groups who intend to curb the rights
of transgender people in the UK. It is
dog whistle politics, focusing on the scapegoating of marginalized people rather
than the issue at hand; increasing access
to public toilet facilities. 

Gender neutral toilets are beneficial for a range of people and situations - for example, parents with children of a different gender; those who
care for people of a different gender; some
disabled people who have a personal
assistant of a different gender, and both
cisgender and transgender people who
experience gender presentation scrutiny in
public spaces.

The government claims that the intention
for this consultation is to provide ‚Äòdignity
and respect for all. I demand that they truly
provide this dignity and respect by listening
to the voices and needs of trans people and
their allies.

There is an architectural group called _Stalled!_ dedicated to setting a new standard for bathrooms which is more inclusive, more useful, more accessible, and gender neutral.  And their [signs](https://images.squarespace-cdn.com/content/v1/5ad60216da02bcd61379bf06/1569594525017-WITD8KVQZWBF6INYMLKO/ke17ZwdGBToddI8pDm48kBL7y0DpH_e0bbX7enFn0u57gQa3H78H3Y0txjaiv_0fDoOvxcdMmMKkDsyUqMSsMWxHk725yiiHCCLfrh8O1z5QPOohDIaIeljMHgDF5CVlOqpeNLcJ80NK65_fV7S1UT4ke-2faLbDJ2EQYXZquaaYAmln24LeHvojPJ-RAjfURBpFeAJxHLqEa5Otf4mhGw/Final+Exterior.jpg?format=1500w) are just objectively superior.

Here are two prototypes:

- https://www.stalled.online/gallaudet
- https://www.stalled.online/airport

They have successfully [amended the international plumbing code](https://www.archpaper.com/2019/03/international-plumbing-code-changes-facilitate-all-gender-restrooms/) to allow for gender neutral bathrooms which follow their principles.  If you‚Äôd like to learn more, listen to [this podcast.](https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/where-do-we-go-from-here/)

I hope if we can share these proposals with enough people they will see just how much better bathrooms will be if we make them more accessible by every metric.
And I thought we were so liberal get your heid oot yer arse bojo
Yeah but that won't stop the tories one of the last good things they did was the upskirting ban about 3 years ago yes only 3 years ago look up the story that started it it's genuinely disgusting
THANK YOU you have just saved me like five hours
Yeah exactly homelessness is a serious problem especially in London some got temporary shelter to get them off the streets to protect them from covid
We never had any real say over EU law that's why we left

A Middle-aged Lady Thought I was Taking 50 Dollars from Her and Went Mask Off	"TW/ Transphobia

A lady came into my job asking to put money onto her debit card. She asks to put 150 on the card. So I put in the register 150, I check that the money is real and get caught up on the 100 dollar bill because it looks kinda off, but I just think, whatever, then go onto the next bill. Since my attention was on the first bill, I check the second and for some reason I saw it as a 50. So I put all the money in the drawer. She calls 30 minutes to an hour later and says she gave me 200 and didn't get her 50 dollars in change because she was tired and assumed I gave her change with the receipt. I say, ""I'm pretty sure you gave me 150, but alright."" She says she's sure she gave me 200 and says she'll be there shortly. I say, okay, see you soon. She comes in asking for the money. I say yeah I mean I can probably just give you the 50 out of the drawer if you're sure. And she says, is there anyone else in the store? Is your manager here? I say yeah but he's busy, and I'm pretty sure I can justdo this. She walks away and finds my coworker explaining the situation. My coworker says she's not a manager but can get one, she does. She comes back and informs the lady that my manager will be right out, he's doing something. This lady keeps going over the situation to my coworker and throughout uses he and she interchangeably to refer to me. Whatever, I'm used to that. She then asks, ""Do we need to call the police? Can we check the footage? Could we check the drawer?"" I look at my coworker and she's just like, ""No no no, we don't need a call the cops, we can just check the drawer. My manager will be right out."" The lady then goes over what happened one more time but says, ""That thing took my 50 dollars."" Me and mycoworker just stared at each other while this lady just looked down at her phone, both baffled. The lady follows my coworker around as I go back to my job and wait for the manager. The manager eventually comes out and starts to found the drawer forthe lady. Me and my coworker are just doing our jobs then we talk asking what the fuck she was doing calling me a thing. Then we continue our work. Eventually I make my way to near the front by the time he's done counting the drawer. Turns out therewas a little bit over 50 dollars in the drawer. So alright I messed up, my manager apologizes on my behalf, the lady agrees it was partially her fault, she gets the 50 dollars back. All is well and ends well, right? Nah. The lady walking to leave turns to me and says, ""By the way, you do not pass. You needs shave that mustache."" I have zero facial hair. I shave daily before work and am in the process of laser hair removal. She then continues, ""You're not fooling anyone."" She continues walking and at the door she says, ""And y'know what, I'm calling the cops because you tried stealing 50 dollars from me. You probably kept it in the drawer to steal it later. I'm calling the cops F-SLUR."" She did not say, ""f-slur"" she said the slur. Then me and my manager stare at each other dumbfounded. He says, ""That's not going to be tolerated, she's not welcome here."" My coworker and manager are black and don't take kindly to hate speech and that of the like. So while I'm just kinda laughing and smiling at the absurdity of the situation they find it not funny and very bad. Anyways, so the next few customers I just straight up say, ""yeah my night hasn't been incredible, was just called a slur."" I tell 2 customers what I told you now, but the last customers of the night were two flamboyant guys door dashing. I didn't think anything of them. Then when I was ringing them up I told them I was called a slur, and said the slur I was called. Then I realized they were most likely a gay couple as they reacted to me saying it as, ""No no, I do not like that word, at, all."" So yeah that's the full story. Random old lady went mask off thinking I stole 50 bucks."	"Well, here's hoping she's banned for life.
Oh my goodness üòûüòûüòû I am so terribly sorry that this happen to you. No one deserves to be great that way. Good on you for keeping your cool.


>The manager eventually comes out


Congrats to them! /s
Well I wouldn‚Äôt even care to attend what she wants , when I see red flags
I‚Äôm glad your manager and coworker were supportive üíñ
Where does she live
I would probably be fired or in jail if that old sack of shit said that to me
Whenever someone says something like ‚Äûyou don‚Äôt pass, shave that moustache‚Äú I just return the favour, seeing middle aged women desperately try to defend their womanhood is funny because I usually end it with a ‚Äûfeels bad doesn‚Äôt it?‚Äú ‚Ä¶ I‚Äôm petty some days ‚Ä¶ but hey they deserve it
So, you met Karen? ;) Glad your co-workers had your back. Nice to hear that.

should be Legal to torture such people .. imagine the fun we could have if wed be legally able to inflict the same amount of physical pain on someone as they did Psychological Pain .. would be quite fun :3
I‚Äôm not trying to be rude, but I can not imagine an old lady saying ‚Äúyou don‚Äôt pass.‚Äù The verbiage and structure of the way we use and say ‚Äúyou pass/you don‚Äôt pass‚Äù is a relatively new thing (last fifteen years.) Let alone using pronouns interchangeably as if she was going back and forth between being ‚Äúpolitically correct‚Äù (in her mind) and misgendering you out of anger. That‚Äôs more something ignorant millennials and gen Zers do. Are you being completely honest?
Here's hoping.
Here's hoping she's banned FROM life.
No, hope she gets robbed for real on the way home.
Nah, it was funny as hell, I so badly wanna talk with the cops. I lived through a r/thathappened post
HAHHAHA
Yeah, but that's kinda my job. And I get called Sir or Mister all the time. It wasn't too outta the ordinary to begin with.
Yeah, a good deal of customers and all my coworkers are which is nice.

let‚Äôs try to stay sane and not fantasize about t*rture because‚Ä¶. Do I need to say why? Frustration is understandable, but this is the reaction they want.
Extreme disagree.
You forgot to add, ‚ÄúIn Minecraft.‚Äù
""Old people never pick up new language, and never alternate misgendering for plausible deniability"" -You, apperently

Have you... never interacted with old people in real life? Do you think they are an abstract monolithic construct and not a hugely varied population? There are old trans people on this subreddit, old people are not all technologically inept and out of touch with the way language changes.
Really? Lol
I use to work for airline as cabin crew  there one pilot way hurtful  asked him to self service never served him üòÇ  & hope you don‚Äôt get to see such ppl again hug for you dear ü§ó
im not even frustrated .. just psychotic at this point üôà
ouh yeah .. fuck ...:(
too late now .. but we can still push them into the creeper farm ü§£
I‚Äôm not being rude or saying old people don‚Äôt pick up new language. ‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt pass‚Äù is just a manner of speaking and a concept old folks don‚Äôt really typically get exposed to though.
You're not psychotic, you're edgy.
Well I swear on my life and hope to die it happened. It was fucking baffling. I know it really does sound like an r/thathappened but it was 100% real.
I see, thank you for humoring me! I‚Äôm sorry you had such an awful experience.
Nah, it really is fine. I don't care, no one was physically harmed and I know what I look like and I'm confident in myself. It honestly feels like a fever dream."	vkwkyh	trans	509	0.98	2022-06-26 04:33:22
Montana shoots down bill blocking healthcare for trans youth.		"Oh thank god.
actual progress? christ
Dear diary,

Today, Montana wasn't entierly hateful and prejudiced.
Good on them!! I'm impressed
Montanan here, my trans friends and i collectively exhaled.
As someone from Montana this makes me quite happy. Our state can be really hit or miss when it comes to social progress, we aren't nearly as backwater conservative as many think, but I was worried after this last election. Glad to see I can still have some faith in my state.
Good
So one state that isn't horrible.
Good news thx Montana!
How do you get the trans flag under your name?
I hate how our ‚Äúprogress‚Äù is defined as other people *not* taking away things
Mmmmm, nothing was progressed.

It's just, not a detriment.

When a whole political party is using targeted prejudiced codified into laws, neutrality can be as surprising as progress.

But, no. No *progress* was made here.
Washington is about to mandate coverage at least

We‚Äôve won a small battle in Alabama for trans youth	I would like to start by saying that I work directly for my districts representative in Alabama at his place of business. I just spoke to him and he told me that the bill banning medical intervention for trans youth under 19 won‚Äôt pass in this session. They got enough pushback that they‚Äôve decided to move it back and focus on other things like the gambling bill. I was at least a little happy and wanted to let other trans youth in Alabama know.	"I just want to add really quick that this doesn‚Äôt mean the bill is completely gone this just means that it‚Äôs been put back for a while and if it gets enough support it will come back up
Alabama just needs to be less ‚Äúyee-haw‚Äù and more equal... Alabama resident here...
This makes me so happy. Finally, something nice in this state.
Thank you.   
It's a small victory, and still much needed. Keep up the good fight.
Yay I just moved to Alabama and seeing this helps a lot
It'd be amazing if it was struck down outright
Why cant they just listen to the damn doctors and experts? The government mandates any educational curriculum, and then goes directly against what it teaches to pass harmful laws? Like no crap theres backlash, the universities and medical professionals are all saying its stupid and harmful, and the only support its received is from people it doesnt affect. If the bill passes, it will only do harm, and there is no logical reason for it other than corruption. The bill came out of nowhere and theres no cause for it other than hate.
Fr
I can only hope, our very few democratic representatives are trying really hard to get rid of it.
Because it's easier for a politician to get support calling trans people descendents of Satan than to talk about actual issues.
Because the doctors and experts disagree with their bigotry.
I don't know why the Supreme Court hasn't stepped in
For the Supreme Court to make decisions, there has to be a lawsuit filed. Then it has to make it via appeals to the Supreme Court in most cases. If it makes it that far, the Supreme Court votes on whether or not to take the case. *Then* the Supreme Court decides and the decision becomes precedent for interpreting a statute. They have rules that are a little bit different from pretty much any other institution in the USA.

There are definitely lawsuits in motion, it's just a lengthy process. The 2015 ruling on gay marriage took 3 years and the cumulation of 6 separate suits to actually result in a Supreme Court intervention.
Oh
Also unfortunately very important: the SC won't look at a case if it stops being relevant. So let's say a child who wants hormones is 16, and it takes 2 years to move through that process. Well, now the child is an adult and can get the hormones. Case dismissed. Now let's imagine the child is 10, but the parents decide that they have to do what's best for their kid and move somewhere else. Case dismissed.

The ACLU has become really good at finding the right case that perfectly encapsulates a ruling that Justice Gorsuch is going to vote for and making sure it goes through all the right channels, but this is challenging, because you'd really have to harm the child to make a relevant case."	n5t3g3	trans	484	0.99	2021-05-05 22:59:22
"Florida law passed that allows death penalty for people ""commiting sexual crimes against children"""		"Why did Reddit remove the post?
They also no longer require a unanimous jury decision for the death penalty, 4/12 jurors can vote no and they can execute. Supposedly because of the Parkland shooting but that isn‚Äôt how this will be used (and even in extreme situations the state should not be given the authority to execute)
Based mod pinned comment.

Surprising for a mainstream subreddit, but pretty nice!
The bill in question specifically applies only to sexual battery, not just any ""sexual crime against children"". This would not apply to those in violation of the anti drag laws, though it does open the door for expanding what sexual crimes receive the death penalty in the future
This is essentially Florida giving themselves the ability to kill trans people for doing nothing. If you‚Äôre trans, DO NOT GO TO FLORIDA, if you love there, get the hell out, several states have passed trans refuge bills so you may be able to go to one of those states
This is no longer ""the start of a genocide."" This is the genocide.
For the longest time I thought trans rights was a given thing for the US considering my country had them. Australia will always have a place for you guys ‚ù§Ô∏è
What was this about?
I live in Florida üò®
Holy shit
Sounds good until you realise they‚Äôre considering our existence a sexual crime against children and conveniently leave out child marriage. This is actual genocide.
Passing that law isn‚Äôt the problem - it‚Äôs defining reading a child a story while in a dress and having an ID that lists AGAB as male as a crime.
This law is against sexual battery against children below the age of 12. I think we can all agree the death penalty (when there is solid evidence) is right for it?
[removed]
[removed]
Probably mass reporting.. the poster has to appeal the decision.
It only applies to sexual battery right now, but we've seen how quickly they are escalating.

They are building the framework for classifying the public existence of trans and GNC people, and anything intended to help trans youth, to be a sex crime against children. And the framework for making sex crimes against children punishable by death, without even requiring a unanimous jury.

Anyone in Florida is in immediate severe danger. We need to help people get out. Moving is expensive and difficult but we are reaching the ""grab what you can and run like your life depends on it, because it does"" point.
They‚Äôre going to make it apply to obtaining gender confirming care
The Lgbt community would do well not to overplay this rule as it currently stands or the mainstream will get the message that any lgbt sector has sympathy with child abuse, however it Does need to be closely watched to ensure it doesn‚Äôt escalate
I mean, I'm Texan, basically just Aussie with a funny accent. Cows? Check. Desert out west and greener coasts the east? Check. Trucks/Utes? Distinctive hats? Cute nicknames for feral and native animals, including the cane toad (native here), that will absolutely cause you issues? Check, check, and check (somehow ""stingers"" and ""salties"" don't *quite* have the gravity both of those things deserve). It's the same place with more expensive shipping and less people. Also, swap deer for kangaroos.
A law in Florida that basically made the punishment for gender affirming care..the death penalty.
time to run. I know the idea of leaving with nothing is scary but the alternative may be the cattle cars.
The death penalty is bad, actually.
There have been many studies over decades that show the death penalty does not deter crime, and in fact states in which use the death penalty have a higher homicide rate. Studies also show the percentage of people who have been on death row and exonerated (which quite frankly any percentage is too high..), as well as the disproportional numbers between races. Death penalty cases are also recommended more often for white victims and black defendants. The death penalty absolutely does not work, is biased and should not continue to be used.

sure, until they decide that trans people teaching children or making children ""bear witness"" to their existance is a form of sexual battery. 

sexual assault also tends to be extremely difficult to prove, especially in children who don't always know they're being assaulted or don't have the ability to communicate what happened to them. and i can promise they sure as hell aren't putting any priests or politicians on the gallows for touching kids, otherwise they'd have done it by now.
Because states passing laws forbidding minors from receiving gendering affirming care or banning drag shows (or being in drag), etc are stating they are doing it to protect children, while also stating these things are inherently sexual. With that being said, its a slippery and fast slope to these laws leading to other laws stating doctors who provide gender affirming care are commiting sexually violent acts against minors, as well as anyone in drag who allows minors to view their shows.
You are absolutely right. We're in MO, but also in a ""get out ASAP"" state. I only meant that this specific change doesn't directly impact us *yet*. It still a terrifying next step in genocide
Yes, no doubt about that. They want being trans to be punishable by death
Texas is Just Northern Australia
There's a feral colony of kangaroos in Central Texas that's been roving the country north of Austin for a couple decades now.
Do they forget that cis people get gender affirming care too? Like e.g men getting treated for gynecomastia/low testosterone/erectile dysfunction?
this one was about ""sexual crimes"" against children. Not gender affirming care. Not that I would be surprised.
Sexual battery: ‚Äúunwanted sexual contact without the victim's consent‚Äù. 

Even if they‚Äôd make laws where some trans things are seen as sexual assault (which they won‚Äôt) it can by defenition never be sexual battery. That would never hold up in court. 

Also, no they wouldn‚Äôt have put priests and politicians on the gallows already for it if they wanted to. Because they can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs what the law is for.

Fact that i‚Äôm -2 on upvotes on a comment condemning paedophilia is also a bit weird lol.
I'm about to move away from Missouri after thirteen years with only what I can fit in a rented minivan.
I totally forget about that. We're good at feral species.
I do not know where exactly but there are laws banning ""drag performances"" in public spaces to ""protect the children"" (even if we all know that children will not suddenly turn trans or gay or anything else just from seeing other people being happy and those that are will just feel isolated oppressed and be the target of harmfull actions but its sooooooooo much about protection, sry rant) now if florida has the same law then yes just beeing yourself might be considered ""sexual vrimes against children""
They labeled gender affirming care as a ""sexual crime"" I thought with this law.
Pedos should be rotting in solitary. As soon as the government can execute someone folks like desantis will look for any reason to use that on their enemies
Yeah, it feels like it's part of a plan. ""see they're trans. IN PUBLIC! and they just commit sexual crimes. For being trans in public"".
The bill specifically references ‚Äúsexual battery of a minor‚Äù which is a felony crime that already exists in state law across the US. You should actually read about what you‚Äôre outraged on.
Nah, but I wouldn't be surprised. That's somewhere in their plans. Perhaps not a ""sexual crime"", simply just illegal for ""trust me, I know the science.. amen""

It would also mean that the offenders could just kill their victims, because why not? They are getting the death penalty regardless. 

And it would possibly deter victims from stepping forward with claims of abuse, because the offenders are often people they know. They could be told ""You wouldn't want dear Uncle Touchy to die, would you?""
Being trans shouldn't be one reformed bill or bad precedent away from a death sentence. Just because the witchhunters arent killing anyone right now does not make it ok to erect the stakes they will use to burn people. And i will have you know i would be outraged about either bill on their own already. Having the death panelty is already disgusting enough making more laws that execute is downright revolting. And finding out that the bill is  still then a step away from promiting genocide doesnt make it any better
Again, you‚Äôre dying on the hill of an existing capital felony offense that Florida already sentences to life in prison without parole for.
No im dying on multiple hills all at once which you dont seem to get:

1. Im against the death sentence. Humans make errors and you cannot give back a life you have taken when you figure out ten years later that you have killed someone innocent.

2. Being trans shouldn't be even remotely close towards being considered sexual crimes against children. 

3. A new bill makes more headlines than some changes to an existing one just because right now its not yet explicitly stated doesn't mean it can't be added later and if you have seen any of the hate against the trans community as of late you would not hold the opinion that those couple words mean something long term.


 You can clearly see the direction this is going and yet you either believe naively that the same people calling us demons and abominations and whatnot would not push their anti trans agenda further and plan to expand on this law or you are choosing to downplay the significance of steps taken."	12o03t1	trans	474	0.99	2023-04-16 07:44:02
Nearly 240 anti-LGBTQ bills filed in 2022 so far, most of them targeting trans people	"Nearly 240 anti-LGBTQ bills filed in 2022 so far, most of them targeting trans people

The annual number of anti-LGBTQ bills to have been filed has skyrocketed over the past several years, from 41 in 2018 to 238 in less than three months of this year.

I spent time last Sunday with my close friends and their children who I have known since birth. One of the¬†children was trans. When I hugged a 14-year-old child there was no difference in the love we shared since he was a small child. The only difference was he was happy.¬†

""The road to heaven is paved with hell"". 
Biggest way to say ""fuck you"" to the bigots is to keep existing.
Mmm, smells like desperation to me, they're acknowledging without admitting, in their usual roundabout, dumbdick, apologies = weakness sort of way, that they have lost the culture war outright. That doesnt make them less dangerous, of course, desperation can excuse all sorts of horrors, but their ideology has gone utterly bankrupt, their appeals to godly authority fall on increasingly deaf ears, and their arguments can't even hold up to the most casual of rational scrutiny, and so, authoritarian power grabs and imperial decrees are all they have left. It's scary, but also rather thrilling, these are the symptoms of a, dare I say it, transitional period in human history, anything could happen next, nothing is static, everything is up for grabs now, and like our enemies, we need to grab for whatever we can get, and SQUEEZE.
Between Wade v Roe and all these anti-lgbtq/anti-trans bills, I'm feeling both furious and hopeless. Hopefully there's some way we can get get our bodily autonomy back but right now I am just feeling a sort of way

Cis terfs: ""what bills has any government come out with thats against you? youre being petty""
America is just the worst
i get that by most standards america is ""the best country in the world"" but that really only has to do with like money and the economy. we have some pretty shotty laws on being able to be who u are. only certain people can be free in the land of the free, and theyre the most bigoted and typically racist and sexists mfers ever. 

granted lgbt people arent treates *quite* as bad as some countries, but we still have plenty of homophobia and transphobia to go around. 

america may be the land of the free but i sure dont feel free. my parents can openly practice christianity and people would join them but if i tried to openly be trans, id get kicked out and might even get killed.

Why is this one  (and other similar ones)  listed  as an Anti-Trans Bill?

TN HB0474 - AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 39, relative to sexual offenses.

[https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/](https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-transgender-legislation/)

TW mentions of sexual acts on minors

>!TN HB0474 - AN ACT to amend Tennessee Code Annotated, Title 39, relative to sexual offenses. ""As introduced, broadens the offense of indecent exposure when committed by masturbation or exposure to include victims who are 14 years of age or younger or any age if the victim does not consent to the conduct; increases the penalty for indecent exposure in certain circumstances. - Amends TCA Title 39.""!<

&#x200B;

It has nothing to do with trans people?

Is the organisation that does the list conflating anti-trans bills and anti-child sexual assault ?

As a trans person who has been through CSA I'm  genuinely disturbed that they put it in the list of  actual Anti-Trans Bills.

Could someone people explain why in the world an organisation like this would do something so creepy?
Thank you for the understanding...The old, corrupt, and bitter constantly want to clamp down on our freedoms... What issues are going on in your country with LGBT+?
I agree with you.They want to pick a fight I say we fucking give them one to remember
See the stickied comment on this post.
This link lists every single one: https://freedomforallamericans.org/legislative-tracker/anti-lgbtq-bills/
Yeah, that doesn‚Äôt make sense. I read the bill, but couldn‚Äôt find the existing statute that it amends. Regardless, the optics aren‚Äôt good. You may want to reach out to the folks that compiled that list: https://act.freedomforallamericans.org/a/contact

FWIW, that list is LGBTQ+; there is a separate button that filters for just the trans bills. Also, my biggest takeaway isn‚Äôt the weird inclusion of this one bill, but the fact that there are 30 (THIRTY?!?) other bills currently in TN:(
If i said what the most near if a transphobic and homophobic n-zi i had seen in my life was in the third place to become president of the republic and i have a risk i get assaulted in some place if im not wearing clothes ""appropriate"" for my gender and some problems with the terf here and their (fortunately they are less numbarous than in the uk) i think even if the gouvernement isn‚Äôt openly transphobic they are big way to improve, like making transition more easy and more clear because even if i follow a psychiatrist, because she isn‚Äôt specialized on that she isn‚Äôt sure she have the right to autorised to allow or even have a word to said about my transition, and also make city place more safe for transgender to wear clothes they want without having the risk to be assaulted because they don‚Äôt look like a woman (it is less problematic for a woman to have a cloths that is more manly but a man the have woman clothes have way more chance to get assaulted for no reason)

You're trans and you support blocking trans people from gender affirming health care?

Oh! You're referring to Le Pen!
No, she isn‚Äôt transphobic and homophobic (if she is, she do not show it) and less racist than the one i talk, also she was in second place, im talking about eric zemmour

Edit : unless you are speakin of jean-marie le pen, in that case as racist as zemour but he isn‚Äôt in politics this day because of his old age (he kinda lost his mind, senile) and one of his daughter take his place made some change in the political party and meany have left, zemour was part of them

A Message to All Trans People in The U.S	"I'm afraid for my and all other trans people's safety  This world is against us

The U.S. keeps getting worse and worse I have seen no improvement.

My state of Illinois is safe and has been,

 but everywhere else seems completely screwed.  Texas is bordering on genocidal actions and Florida's banning of care for trans youth. Arkansas proposed a bill banning GAC for anyone under 26 The spike in anti-trans violence and rhetoric. So much more  Land of the free. That's a straight-up lie.  We preach civil liberty whilst oppressing large groups 

We've seen book burnings, dehumanizing rhetoric, and legislation targeting minorities before.  The 1930's in Germany specifically. Then Minority's warning of what was to come was seen as paranoia and the ramblings of the mad.  

Now trans individuals are treated much the same. Like loons and freaks. They wouldn't listen before, and they won't listen now. Sadly we must fight. Fight for our lives, lest we lose them at the hands of our oppressors.  We must fight any way we know how, but be careful. Your actions now could be used to further demonize us. Tread carefully.  Vandalise and deface the property of bigots.   Leave a message  Make it strong

Make it noticeable  


I felt I needed to say it"	"Oklahoma has a bill to ban trans care for anyone under 26. I think Arkansas' bill was for under 18. So the situation is actually slightly worse which sucks
Peacefully trying to fix things doesnt work, peaceful protests and trying to ""talk"" to nazis don't work, nazis should be afraid of being nazis

You don't progress with peacefully talking with a nazi over tea, they don't deserve respect from anyone, much less from the people they are trying to kill

(This is not directed at OP, I agree with OP's sentiment)
Dear US-based transphobes who I know are lurking here: Thank you for paying your taxes so Veterans like myself can have access to gender affirming care through the VA
I would like to add to OP's stance but add Colorado to the safe zone... we are guaranteed to control the state government for at least another decade. It's a safe haven for LGBTQ+ people. üè≥Ô∏è‚ÄçüåàüíØüíúüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüåàüëç‚ùÑÔ∏èüèÇüåÑü§ü‚õ∞Ô∏è
Basically everything I wanted to say has been said. Even as a cis person I feel scared and want to leave the country before it becomes fascist. Please arm yourselves.
We have to organize.  If we try to deal with this as individuals, we will fail, and the consequences are life and death.  I have already started implementing my exit plan from the U.S. as a contingency plan.  

I'm in a fairly friendly state, and I am planning a sizeable add on to my house in case I need to even temporarily house refugees.
It's insane that I have been telling people this will happen over and over and over and my mom after I actually shared several links over whats going on to let people know lately actually has the audacity to ask me whats wrong. The cis do not care. They just don't. It's not being talked about, it's barely being covered by them so we just do not matter and frankly it terrifies me that even if we did fight back they'd just tell us to get on the cattle cars because it's scaring them to think they would ever have to fight or be uncomfortable.

Just look how they acted when people tried to defend the drag queen bars and you would see comments saying how people with guns are just making it worse and that we would be jeopardizing everyone. We do not matter in their eyes and are only an afterthought.

The irish had the troubles, we have the concerns. Because that's all we are, a concern, a background thought. I try to be optimistic but I can't be right now.
we need to start arming ourselves and protecting ourselves a gay bar was attacked and a gay restaurant had a brick thrown at the window. this isn't new to our people but we need to start self protecting our community. the govt doesn't want to protect us the govt gang(cops) doesn't wanna protect us. it's up to us to protect each other now and im afraid as a trans woman it'll get worse
People are attempting more desperate measures against us because we‚Äôve been making progress, and these sorts of bill (which keep getting proposed, then failing) can help open people‚Äôs eyes to the fact that those who are against us are actively trying to kill is and get them to help us. There‚Äôs one major step you can take to help: **Tell allocishets in your life about this shit, most of them don‚Äôt know, and when they do, they usually get more vocal about supporting us. They won‚Äôt fight for us, but once they realize our lives are on the ballot, most will vote for us.** Progress is being made, things are getting better. It‚Äôs just a very painful process.
In Arkansas you can drink, drive, vote, etc and do whatever the hell you want but now you‚Äôre not mature enough for GAC
America is dead to me. Honestly I don't think anything can save it. 

The worst part is the fact that the toxicity from America is spreading across the border. We've had mass shootings when shit like that never happened here. We're supposed to be better than America not sink to their level. 

At least we haven't back peddled on human rights like you all have. Yet.
I think someone said, that there aren't enough trans people to go full blown Martin Luther King Jr. Civil Rights Movement. One would need to unite every Person under the LGBT+ Label in the U.S. And then I'm not sure if it would be enough.

Of course one could start a counter campaign. Propaganda Posters, Fake News, Fear-Mongering. Kinda using the same stuff they use to unite our people against them. But neither are we that well funded, nor do I think it would work honestly..

But the age of talk and winnning them over through discorse has ended..  it is a war, it is funded, it has a purpose and a goal..

And I don't know what can be done to counter it. Propaply getting armed? Capitalism wins again. Arm both sides and collect per bullet.

I think this will either blow over like every fear campaign has before or it will go ballistic.

In which case: man the barricades, keep the degenerates away from the trans children. We see who kills who, fascist!

I hope this wont happen.. fucking 21 century.
I'm finna grab a couple aks a couple 12 gauges, a couple 9mms and probably a.couple rugs to protect my trans sister
My wife is in prison in Florida and I'm in Oregon. We're petitioning to have her sentence transferred here because she's not safe from the guards there
Thank you! Yes, everyone is needed for unifying against this horrible political trend! It
Keeps spreading to other states and is getting more and more extreme!
With the US burning like this, is Canada truly as good as it sounds? Is that the new safe-haven for all living in the US to move to?
Eventually it'll get to a point where they'll create so many laws, that it'll box in cis people who need access to gender care for other reasons or who don't strictly conform to gender norms.
I wish I could leave but the U.S makes it nearly impossible if you aren't rich which is another issue entirely. I hate this country. ""Land of the free"" my ass.
Good luck and stay safe out there
For anyone looking to flee their state, Trans Activist and mom Erin Reed created a map that shows the best and worst states for trans people. 

[https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative](https://erininthemorn.substack.com/p/the-final-anti-trans-legislative)

If you‚Äôre looking to flee the US entirely, the easiest place to go would be Canada, due to the proximity of the country and also has some great protections for trans people, but there are still issues there. Do your research for where you wanna go!

Personally I live in Alabama and I plan on leaving as soon as I finish my degree.
Massachusetts is still a safe haven as is much of VT.
Personally I love trans women/men. Everyone no matter who they identify as or who they like to sleep with is a human,and deserve the same rights as anyone else. No further discussion should be needed!!!
I had to flee Arkansas last year. I was in a small, very insular town, and the amount of transphobic stuff people would spout on the daily was insane. I was in the closet, for obvious reasons, but I had to go because they were starting to sound serious in their threats of ""damnation"".
""It's a big club, and you ain't in it!""

--George Carlin
I think the problem with that strategy is it adds fuel to the fire. Nobody is going to get their shit wrecked and think ""maybe I was wrong about those people"". They'll double down, it'll end up on Fox News, etc.
I'm thankful Maryland is alright for now, though it sucks that my (thankfully cis) girlfriend lives in Texas
What‚Äôs important is that we rely on each other, and be lighter than a feather
While I agree that the US government needs to pull its head in, vandalisation and defacing of property will push those neutral to the other side of the arguement. And given that this community is tiny compared to the population, a civil war is also not the answer, especially given the power of the US armed forces. 

Any attempt at physical action like civil war will only cause those who are agressive towards this minority to believe without a doubt that they are in the right and help them convince others.

You need allies that can support you in the court of public opinion and the abilty to change an economy(thus you need large amounts of people and those who are better off economically). In other words, you need both powerful and large amounts of people to support you so the government has to listen. (Think about how segregation and racism was almost entirely eliminated, minus certain parts of the populace.)

TLDR; you will not win a civil war, think logically and politically, get as many people of all across the spectrum to side with you enough to cause a social, political and economic movement in the culture of the United States.
‚ÄúDr. King's policy was that nonviolence would achieve the gains for black people in the United States. His major assumption was that if you are nonviolent, if you suffer, your opponent will see your suffering and will be moved to change his heart. That's very good. He only made one fallacious assumption: *In order for nonviolence to work, your opponent must have a conscience. The United States has none.*‚Äù

I'm in the same state, Chicago is the only widely democratic (aka trans friendly-ish) part of Illinois, the rest is redneck ass transphobic mf's. I honestly hate living in lower Illinois. [Edit: there's also hardly trans help groups in the rural areas. I feel completely lost, I hate this state, country, and sometimes the whole damn world.]
I agree that govt things r bad and things seem to be getting worse, but idk homie, ‚ÄúTexas is bordering on genocidal actions‚Äù seems like exaggeration to me. I‚Äôd love to see evidence to the contrary if u have it. I‚Äôm not saying things r good for us there, but I do think it‚Äôs important not to make things sound worse than they r, u know? Like Texas isn‚Äôt setting up trans person death camps or anything, they‚Äôre just fucking hella w laws that will cause death and misery, but not on a mass scale equivalent to genocide. Also, I‚Äôve found that ppl matter a lot more than politics. Politicians can do a lot of harm, but the ppl who live around us r the ones that really affect us imo. It‚Äôs chill if I get downvoted for this, I‚Äôm just giving my thoughts as a trans girl.
I live in AR. I NEED to transition one if the reasons I quit trying to commit suicide is so I could transition. If I can't do that what reason I have to live?
I'm pretty sure Colorado is another state that is safe. I know they have protection laws for trans people.
Now is the time to get to a safe blue state. Colorado and Illinois are great options if you can't get to the coasts. At the very least, have a plan if these laws are passed. It's super expensive to move, especially across the country, but the net safety gain is well worth it.
I should probably stay up to date on the topic, but does anyone know how bad it is in Pennsylvania?
My heart breaks for my trans siblings in the us every time a new bill is announced. I'm privileged to live in a country where my rights are not attacked and I wish I could do more to help y'all.

Not in the U.S., but transphobia here is pretty high as well. Being peaceful doesn't help with transphobia itself at all. It only amplifies all the narration against us, which is broadcasted by priests, gov-owned media and right-wing politicians regardless of the party. The only thing why transgenders aren't the main target is that this government is more ""concerned"" about harassing females at all, no matter whether cisgender or transgender. 

However, peaceful informing still helps with trans-friendly initiatives and spreads a word about them.
It's sadly even worse, [Oklahoma has another bill on the docket that is a de facto ban on gender affirming care. For all ages. ](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB250/2023) 

Most if not all of them will get struck down but it's scary as fuck. Seeing your own humanity debated is not a great feeling.
Damn Thanks mixed them up
Church $ at work ! Its how they network.
I can't help but be reminded of Charlie Chaplin's speech from ""The Good Dictator"". I feel like its more relevant now than ever. I wish I had a way to broadcast it to a lot of people, I would have hope that it could change some minds
Armed self defense now
Martin Luther King Jr. was both peaceful and effective.  Not being peaceful could make things way worse for us.  Our generation may not see change.  But, let's represent peace for future generations, at least.
Me too! I truly appreciate old me‚Äôs service now lol
This is what taxes should be for.
Same here, thx yall
You‚Äôre not helping.  Transphobes are morons.  Don‚Äôt do their mental labor for them.
I agree with this! While I don‚Äôt live in CO rn, I have family there and grew up there! A lot of my family since I came out has come to me and said ‚Äúif you ever need to, you know you can come to us and we‚Äôll help you.‚Äù So even if shit hits the fan in my current state, I know I‚Äôll have somewhere safe to go. Honestly I friggin love Colorado.
Most of New Mexico is safe too.
New York is good...legally speaking. Stay out of the rural areas of course, cities are mostly fine.
Yes .Colorado is the best. I can always move back in with family in California if it gets bad here which I don‚Äôt foresee
As long has Big Gretch is office, Michigan is relatively safe as well! Especially in the Metro Detroit/Ann Arbor areas

Oh dang as someone in the middle of arkansas I feel terrified to imagine myself as a fucking refugee having to leave my home despite its flaws.
We have to make some noise and disrupt. You can try to ignore the elephant in the room by looking away, but not when it shrieks in your face

Or as Miles Bron, fiction‚Äôs professional idiot, would put it, we have to go past what people are comfortable with and double down
But the LGBT community is too scared of guns or any method of self defense to actually fight, so we will likely all get jailed and tortured eventually because nobody in this community is going to actually take decisive action.
You‚Äôre completely right about this! I don‚Äôt live in the US thank god, but I managed to get my dad to see how bad things were getting even in our own country just by mentioning a few examples. It‚Äôs easy to feel like the world is against us, but most people‚Äôs hearts are in the right place, they just need some help moving their brains to that place as well. Gathering allies is vital, and it‚Äôs not quite as insurmountable a task as it might seem, provided you don‚Äôt waste time on the wrong people of course
Oklahoma I messed up but they proposed a bill that would in short ban GAC for under those 26   


The scary part is I can see how it might get voted into law.
If you're talking about Canada, y'all are just as bad as us, y'all just lie to yourselves about it. You do remember any the whole ""Indigenous Women"" situation, right? And y'all are just as transphobic and homophobic too.
I love the counter campaign idea.
Look up North Dakota‚Äôs proposed SB2199. So extreme, scary and oppressive!
theres many ways to fight, you dont have to go out and literally assault someone. Nazis need to be afraid to publicly hold their ideology. period. These are people who literally don‚Äôt want us to exist.
Then we need to make any violence against us as too much for the majority of Americans. We need to stop letting them argue our existence and instead force them to explicitly come out against us.
They backed off of black people because they‚Äôre afraid.  They don‚Äôt know any language but fear.  They prove it every single day.  In their mind, if you don‚Äôt scare them then you‚Äôre fair game to target.  They only understand predators and prey; nothing else.

The first pride was a line of people throwing bricks.
X and Newton did more for civil rights than King. The suffragettes were violent too.

Nothing ever changes by peaceful protests.
Yup. Like I feel the energy but it‚Äôs just not gonna help
How can this be done you ask? Use what we have available to us, social media, a mix of kindness and maybe a bit of painting those who wish harm against  monorities as monsters(without them knowing of course). Cator to the neutral, do not be extreme, don't give those who wish harm ammunition to use against you.

There is so much more that can be done, only ever increasing with every addition to both sides.

It's getting Natzi Like
What's the speech?
I also want peace, that doesn't mean we shouldn't fight and protest

Continue on the ""just talking"" will get more and more people killed, nowhere in history people were able to revolutionize history by just having friendly talks with the people that were killing them
Also

Protesting and standing up for our rights ‚â† being violent 

It just means that we need to fight for our rights, and if we are attacked by the people that want to opressor us that we need to fight against them, not quietly, not sitting down and talking, but in the streets, making noise, having our voices heard

You cited MLK, but MLK also said that he wasn't against protests and peaceful protesting was not about keeping our heads down and quietly speaking, it was about fighting for rights, screaming and walking in the streets, witouth resorting to violence 


We still need our voices heard, trying to pretend that we can talk with those people won't really help and will just make the future generation have to deal with more problems we left for them, just like the last generatio left us problems


And vandalizing the property of bigots and etc ‚â† violence so
Wish people would stop repeating silliness about MLK such as this.

Keeping your head down has a time and place when someone is actively trying to harm you is not it.
This is a pretty whitewashed stance. The only reason King was able to be effective with peace was because his contemporaries were willing to use force. He was seen as the ""sensible moderate"", but even he admitted that his protests would have fallen on deaf ears had it not been for the more militant tactics of Malcom X or the Black Panthers, among others. King didn't succeed despite them, he succeeded BECAUSE of them.
Yeah, then he was shot and riots broke out forcing congress's hand to put out a civil rights act that's still allowed systemic racism to mount to this vary day.

MLK Jr. is a figure head and a focal point. Had he not been the reasonable offering versus the looming threat of widespread civil unrest, he wouldn't have been capitulated to.
Always means the world to be so accepted and loved within the community. <3 thanks friend!
We're at the point where it is not fear mongering.
I'm in Arkansas as well In the northwest part and this is all getting a little scary. I knew sanders was going to do this though. May be time to look at moving elsewhere
it might be for the best, esp for our trans brothers and sisters
I get you, I had to flee Arkansas myself last year. I know it's scary to leave but, at this point, it's getting dangerous to stay. At least set up an escape route. I'll remind you that the ""gay panic"" defense is still legal in Arkansas.
I finally managed to escape Arkansas last summer. Now living in SF and have already made it clear to several of my trans friends from back home that I would help them settle in out here.
ur right our apathy and weakness is why we are so easily pushed around
Unfortunately friend, if you don't live in the USA, you don't know how little this applies. People in the USA don't give a fuck about each other. Human life is cheap here and problems are almost always solved with bullets. And cis people do not give a single, solitary fuck. They hate us. They are not only ok with us being murdered, many of them actively want it. Even so called allies are tepid little bitches that won't do shit to help us. Most won't even show up at a protest, even with no danger to themselves. They've got their own selfish concerns. They don't care. We are entirely on our own.
We have an alt right but they're not the majority. Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.
Sure, but we would need artists for anti-right posters and the like. We could also use animators for education videos on the rising threat of naziism in the U S. Doesn't matter if it is exaggerated or not. Thats how this shit works. We would also need people who can write articels. Like when the right does something to the community, we fake news the shit out of it, just like they do with us. And then, if we want to get really dirty here, get some hackers and put smut on Ben Shepiro and Matt Walsh etc. Doxx them, hack them, get them out of the picture. One could try to take the daily wire down etc.

Basically.. fullblown transgender shadow activism.

But all of this shit would need financial funding. I don't have that kinda money. Nor would it be ethical. I don't know if we should care about ethics at this point. Thirdly it could make the situation worse by giving into the ""the wokes are attacking us"" mentality.

I don't know.

For riots we need to be united.
Me too. Standing in front of a tank without any weapon is a suicide. We have to fight, not to let them defeat us. And information war is still a war.
Unfortunately, Nazis are not afraid of anything short of physical violence. Often they aren't even afraid of that. These are scumbag, deplorable people who worship violence and murder and evil. They bathe in it. They drink it. They want to hurt you and everyone you love, and unless you're willing to put a bullet in them (assuming they attack you first and its self defense) they will put a bullet in you and think nothing of it whatsoever. And they figure, hey, if you fight back, they get to murder and beat you even harder, and then talk all about the deplorable violence of the ""trans agenda,"" while whitewashing their own mass murders and atrocities out of the picture. They engage in DARVO. Deny, Attack, Reverse Victim Order. Deny that they are attacking you or that you are oppressed, attack you or your integrity, and reverse victim order to make themselves look like the oppressed victim, fighting for ""American values"" against the depraved, degenerate left. And the conservative right wing media is aiding and abetting them. Fox news and the daily wire are deplorable monstrosities who need to be punished. But there is no way to do so because they have a chokehold on the narrative about whose violence is legitimate and whose is not. AKA, Offensive violence by alt right fascist psychopaths? A-OK. Defensive violence by desperate trans folks just trying to survive to the next day? WOKE MOB. INTOLERANT LEFT.  


To be clear I am not endorsing physical violence here because it will only hurt our cause. As long as they control the propaganda machine and the narrative, neither violence nor non violence has any hope of working. The only way is to take control of the narrative first, to delegitimize their claim to legitimate violence.
We should unite. We can't work this while fractured. Do you have an idea on how we could get everyone together? A new Website, Forum, r/?

That's not at all what I'm saying.

I'm just trying to say we shouldn't resort to violence. That will only paint the targets on our backs even brighter.

Yes, talk, yes protest. But show them we do it peacefully and lovingly.
We need trans people to be a little less MLK, and a little more Malcom X.
I'm not saying that we stick our heads in the sand, at all, nor did MLK.

I'm saying let our voices AND actions represent peace as well as the disparity and discrimination we are facing.  Actions speak louder than words.  Let their own words prove them wrong by our peaceful, but vocally strong united peaceful existence
What is silly about anything I said about MLK?

I'm saying we have to fight our battles wisely, especially for future generations.  We can't get up in arms and expect them to return peace in response.
I respectfully disagree.  The militant movements were happening alongside his.  And he consistently disavowed the other approaches.  He always tried to make things peaceful.

I see what you're saying, but I sincerely don't think he levied, intentionally or not, the contrast to his advantage.

Do we really want to paint the targets on our backs even brighter?  I say we show them that we are normal, peaceful citizens, living normal, quiet lives, and let time prove we were in the right, for future generations.
MLK's life, not death, inspires many to keep pushing forward, peacefully.  His death catapulted his message to cement the inspiration, which rallies the African American rights movement forever. Whatever happened after his death, the riots, was contrary to his message of peace.

Who was more effective and represented the movement more, him or Malcolm X?  Put it this way, which person has a Federal Holiday?

Our trans community should let peaceful representation contradict the way we're being portrayed, and violence never works in the long run for ours or future generations.

As a side note, I'm shocked the mods of this thread are allowing a continuation of violence discussion on this sub.  Aren't you guys violating Reddit terms of service by allowing this discussion?

No offense at all to any of you who disagree with me.

It's just that I'd rather die a martyr and help future generations than elevate the hatred against us by resorting to violence or vandalism, and be painted as the enemy any more in the media.
Of course! I know the feeling. <3
Yeah it's getting ridiculous the closest state to me is OK and that's not any better might have to go FAR
Oof. Honestly though I really feel like alot of ignorance is bred from lack of exposure and I'd hate to have to run for my own safety I'd like to believe I could put up with any mild harassment.  Been tough finding a job though...
It isn‚Äôt weakness to care for about other people and not want to hurt them, even if they hurt you.

Edit: (written concurrently with the response about apathy) and, it‚Äôs not apathy to feel disinclined to act in a society that has shown again and again that you are individually powerless to change it.

But, we can and will and do change it, just by being here and sometimes by acting together. As gloomy as things are right now, things are happening and when I look around, I see trans people fighting. This darkness is going to have to get a hell of a lot darker to make us stop.
Sounds like peaceful methods are not an option...
Alt right isn't the majority here either, but it is a shit hole, I'll give you that.
>Your country are just a bunch of arseholes who are proud of smelling like the shit they are.

I remember Canadian users on here laughing in our fucking faces during the bleakest days of the Pandemic. Your countrymen are every bit as capable of being vile assholes as mine.
I mean... I'm a trans artist. I might f around and find out. But I stay off most social media, so we'd need a coordinator.
Well, you'd need something that can't be shut down easily. So an entirely new website would probably be the best bet. With decoy sites and forums here and there. Right now though, I think reddit will do the job. Also, i'd say that physical locations to talk and communicate is a good idea(although both physical and digital can be dangerous) kind of like what the civil rights movements in the 60-70-80s did.

But you also need to think about what and who you are fighting for, that way you can have true united values so the other side of the arguement can't exploit the lack of unity.
Thanks!
I'm saving this
that was great
Okay you can protest peacefully and lovingly if you want but they won't hear us, they'll laugh at us 

Because the ones in power only hear what the don't want to hear when their position is being threatened or when we make enough noise
Yes!  


Burn things make them pay hold them hostage until they see
Any means necessary.
Your complete misunderstanding and misrepresenting of Malcom X is paralleled by your misunderstanding of political power. He was a great man and doesn't deserve to have his accomplishments belittled by you because you're judging him by the standards of a white supremacist country.

This isn't about great men of history. This is about political movements. By breaking down the civil rights movements into separate figure heads and pitting them against each other, you're missing the whole. It doesn't matter wether or not the riots are what MLK stood for. No one man, moment, or action encapsulates an ever evolving political movement.

Violence against a violent system is a defense mechanisms. If the political structures around us prey upon us, it is only right that we defend ourselves by whatever means necessary. And there are going to be times when it's necessary. Self defense is never something to be ashamed of.
Right. I'm close to Oklahoma as well but I'm just down the road from Missouri.  I was actually thinking of moving to Springfield but I don't think it's going to be any better than Arkansas honestly. May have to go all the way to Colorado or Illinois. Colorado would be my first choice.
It isn't your job to educate them, you don't have to put that on yourself. At this point, they're wilfully ignorant. They know how to learn, and they know where to find information, they just don't want to. If they understood, they'd have to empathize, and they don't want to do that. They'd rather just sit in their echo chamber. If those laws pass, you're in direct danger.
that's apathy and the reason why we are so easily harassed and targeted we will never stand for ourselves if we have the whole don't fight back mentality. care about other people?? idk of u noticed this or not it's not like they exactly want us to be alive so why should we care im not gonna let someone roll over me and pretend to care about them
Peaceful is certainly preferable as all violence does is reinforce their propaganda narrative of ""trans bad."" But we also are under no obligation to stand back as a community while our people are shot to death in bars and on the streets, throw up our hands, and say ""there's nothing we can do.""

An armed guard or two at all lgbt establishments might just send the message that we're ACTUALLY serious about it never happening again.

Being trained in firearms and nonlethal self-defense for those who can, protecting each other by making sure our siblings don't walk home alone or go off with strange men with ill intent, protesting loudly and proactively! All of these tactics are necessary. Depending on our own community for protection is going to be necessary as the social conditions can change rapidly and the state doesn't always have the best interests of LGBTQIA+ folks at heart, to say the least. Only we can help us.
No we don't solve our problems but killing eachother. Unfortunately the toxicity is spreading.
If you resort to violence, you'll end up in jail.  Then, your voice will definitely not be heard, but rather used against you and us
Violence begets violence.  Period.

My comparison of Malcolm X to MLK is being misunderstood.  I don't disagree that Malcolm X was a man of recognition.  But, go ask anyone, who was more influential and effective?  I'm not misunderstanding.  I'm old and wise and know what doesn't work.

I spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm post-op trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.  Do you think I was able to do any good for our cause when I was in solitary confinement?  I had a pencil and one call a day, only to numbers I had memorized.  And, I was non-violent.  Violent people are treated way worse.  I saw it to be true of a ""neighbor"" in jail.

We should never resort to violence.  Our future generations will be the ones suffering more than us.


Again, mods, why are you not stopping all this encouragement of violence?  I'm pretty sure you're in violation of Reddit's terms of agreement.

And, to everyone else including my responder, stop encouraging violence.  I can promise, from living almost 50 years of American history, that you're painting us into a corner that we don't want!  Live for the future generations and quit misrepresenting us!

Don't be who our aggressors want us to be.  It serves us no good.
CO all the way. I still just wish things would change I live where I am by choice I moved back here after living in San Francisco, LA. Denver, some pretty open minded places. And I just love the area I'm in. :( mah home
We are already considered as bad, just for existing. 
I don't know how it looks like in the States, but here insults and radical statements aimed at minorities (incl. transgender people) are allowed by society (mostly using a mechanism of ""they are like that, we can't do anything""), but revenge measures of the same degree are considered an attack. Like we've initiated that when we are only answering to their attack. 

However, I agree.
Except when the ""problem"" is the indigenous population, in which case, it's totally normal to shove their kids into torture centers disguised as schools, where they die in appalling numbers, get shoved into mass graves, and then spend the next 100 years jerking off about how much more progressive you are than your neighbors.
When did I say we had to use violence? Please stop trying to twist my words, my comment literally says that we should protests and yell, I never even talked about being violentnagainst people

You were the one that said we should do things ""lovingly and peacefully "" wich i don't agree, because non-violent protests ‚â† peaceful protests
Lmao, yeah, because it's not like the police won't raid our clubs on false pretenses if we just act nice and cordial.
St. Louis Illinois.  
On the Illinois side.  
I feel safe.  
But fear even that feeling of safety will be taken
Ok. If you want peace, let's advocate peace!
I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

It's not fun. 

Your logic is broken, no offense.  They'll treat you way worse than they did me, if you resort to violence.

And violence would only work against us.  Don't resort to it.
>I've been to jail as a post-op trans woman, spent 36 days and nights in solitary confinement because I'm trans and they couldn't put me in either gender-specific cell block.

Do you think that has more to do with you being potentially violent or you being trans?
They told me it was because I've had surgery.  

They actually had two female officers inspect my genitalia and telling me why.

It was not due to violence on my part, but my protection.  I fully complied all along the way."	10ad3x2	trans	385	0.96	2023-01-12 22:37:56
Accidentally came out	"So if you have been keeping up in the news, Texas decided it was time to violate Human rights, so it's trying to pass a law that says that If you help someone under 18 transition you can go to jail. As a recently re-cracked egg, I wrote an email to the supporters of the bill. I Then got a email back today saying from one of the senator's saying that he'll send this to the guys spear heading the bill. Normally this would be fine, however, I sent it on a old account of mine, which I forgot that My mom had access to. So she must of read it because she sent a weird text and told me to call her in the morning. I'm scared as she forgot about the time I came out to her and she blamed it on something else, which I naively believed to be true. I can only hope it goes well this time. 

I'll try to keep you posted but I make no promises."	"I believe if someone really loves you, they'll never really forget. 

I just came out to my dad... After 3 separate times between 2010 and 2021. I had just assumed that everyone forgot and wrote it off as a phase. I found out that the opposite was the truth.

My sister was disappointed that I wasn't being open about my true self all these years, in & out of the closet. Now, she's my biggest fan! One brother is super supportive, the other, not so much :\

My mom passed away in 2010, before I ever ""officially"" came out. My dad, a devout Baptist Christian, couldn't accept it in 2012, but said he'd still love me. I didn't believe him. 

Then he saw me Super Bowl Sunday 2021, while I was wearing nail polish, my hair longer than ever, tight jeans and a ladie's cut t-shirt. (still cis tho ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è) 

When I spoke to him later that week, he said he instantly knew what my presentation meant. That I was serious about transition this time. I told him I was on HRT now, and planning to go all the way in the next year or two... and he's basically like ""do whatever you think you have to do to be happy... I'll love & support you either way.""

Moral of the story: if someone truly loves you and cares about you, they will have no choice but to support you in your life decisions. üíñ I'm rootin' for you Hon!
Go on tinder and find new parents
May the Force be with you
That happened to me over 5 years ago.  It was a horrible day, emotionally.  I was going to start HRT that month but my accidental outing to my parents and family put my plans to a screeching halt.  They were broken-hearted and very saddened.  I felt hit like a ton of bricks in the stomach.  To this day, I‚Äôve had a hard time overcoming the guilt and shame I‚Äôve experienced and felt within.
That is amazing that you did that and got a response like that and I hope your mom takes it well goodluck
Yeah, I'm from Texas too and it totally blows how transphobic this state is being. DMV won't change my marker even though I have medical letters and the courts won't get back to me on my petition. Plannedparenthood also got cut off medicaid for gender transition. You can start hormone replacement therapy with Planned Parenthood but you can't use medicaid you have to pay out of pocket now. Hopefully things will get better but the people in office here are very narrow minded. I hope your situation with your mom goes better than you anticipate but if things get difficult you gotta make your future dreams come true no matter what daggers life throws at you. I believe in you, your best future is something worth fighting for so don't let anyone tell you who you can't be.
I‚Äôll have to disagree with the ‚ÄúIf someone loves you, they‚Äôll never forget.‚Äù 
People can‚Äôt control what they remember. It‚Äôs especially hard to remember things that have been one way for years upon years. 

Especially being a parent. It‚Äôs not even someone like a friend you talk to however much, but the kid you‚Äôve probably been talking to just about every day for years and years, so it can be easy to forget.

Though, IMO, that goes for maybe the first couple of times for parents forgetting. But after that is a different story.

But not being supportive of them is just transphobic, no way around that, really.


Edit: it‚Äôs unrealistic to think that every **should** remember right away. Not only is it unrealistic, but it is simply wrong to say that if they don‚Äôt remember the first time, that they don‚Äôt love you.
Thank you! I just finished talking with her and she accepted me! It feels amazing!
They accepted me so crisis averted
üòÇ best comment
Thank you! They ended up accepting me!
It's both horribly sad and validating when I hear that  someone had the same experience I'm having. I'm sorry. I know how it feels. The guilt of bringing suffering to your loved ones is emotionally and mentally wrecking. I just hope it gets better somehow.
Sorry for the novel... but I'm very proud of you! keep your head up little one, and never doubt yourself üòâ

"Federal ""Don't Say Gay"" bill"	"I don't know if there's anything wrong with making this post and I guess if so whatever it'll get removed but I just want some people to commiserate over this news with.

Even if the bill doesn't pass, the fact that they're attacking us on a federal level now is terrifying to me. I just want to get out of this godsforsaken country. I want to live somewhere that doesn't want me gone.

What can I even do.

[[[Context]]](https://www.npr.org/2022/10/21/1130297123/national-dont-say-gay-stop-children-sexualization-bill)"	"They can federally suck my gock. 

Real talk though it will never advance and will only be used to waste time and posture to an increasingly small and increasingly radical group of loud supporters. They do not represent any majority of Americans; not the government, nor the people.
Sounds like they're making up something that sounds horrible, so that they can then say something else that seems a little less horrible but just equally as outrageous to get it to pass.
 
 It's how the extreme right wing tends to do its politics, and get away with half the shit that it gets away with.
They're doing this to make a point, that the nazi party is alive and well and in charge. This is all going to come crashing down on their heads soon. All of it, not just rainbow hate.
The bill hasn‚Äôt even moved out of the house. Since October, it hasn‚Äôt even been spoken about. It got introduced and forgotten. Why unnecessary fear-mongering?
Malicious compliance. Your principal isn't Mr. John Doe, he is ""School Administrator JD11235"".  
Its not, ""Principal Doe has a lovely picture of his wife on his desk."" It's, ""Administrator JD11235 has an image referencing the legal companion of JD11235, in violation of legislation. ""
Ordinarily I would not be that concerned about something like this at a federal level but American politics has now been running on the ‚Äúthe stupidest thing that could happen happens‚Äù rule for long enough that I don‚Äôt let myself get my hopes up
How bout instead of running away in mass exodus like cowards we take an actually stand for our rights and get this ACTUALLY DO SOMETHING INSTEAD OF CRYING AND WHINING
Federally speaking, I don‚Äôt give a fuck and  if they make being gay or trans illegal, I will be a criminal
As a last option, I quit my job, sold my car, donated everything else and bought a one way ticket to San Francisco. I'm establishing residency, getting an ID and soon employment. The city has amazing resources and if you're not safe where you are, this is an option. If you want more details I can provide :)
> The bill's prospects are nil while Democrats control the White House and Senate   

> The bill would not pass in the current Congress, given that such legislation is solely a Republican effort and Democrats have a functional majority in each chamber.  

[‚Ä¶]

> Even if the proposed legislation were to pass in a Republican-controlled House and Senate, it would be vetoed by President Biden. So don't expect this bill to go anywhere, for at least a while.
Stonewall 2 time?
Seriously? This would outlaw my children‚Äôs encyclopaedia for having nude pictures in the human anatomy section. You‚Äôre having your period at 9 because that happens? Good luck getting developmentally appropriate educational materials about that. A kid is getting bullied because they have gay/trans parents? Literally no way to legally address the problem. Trying to explain why you shouldn‚Äôt use homophobic slurs at other kids would be next to impossible. Nice :/
Can't help but notice that k-3 line is back, likely skipping over the ""and where not otherwise appropriate for the rest of school"" bit. 

That deliberately worded K-3 frontloaded into that line makes people think of kindergarten and 3 year olds (as that's what defenders of the don't say gay bill keep telling me anyway)
Even if it doesn‚Äôt pass, the fact that this is even being put into proposition on a federal level is terrifying. It‚Äôs going to continue to fuel the hatred towards LGBTQ individuals. And it continues to reinforce the idea that our rights are being targeted and can be taken away from us.
I truly don't believe their intent is to pass it I believe that their intent is to see how far they can push The extent of the progress that they believe they've made.
In theory could also be an attempt to seize more control to give them the opportunity to bring in a military type force to squash us should we riot over it and then they would claim look do you see how violent these people are.
They will do anything in their power to destroy us at every level
This is gonna sound harsh but it‚Äôs time for all of us to start shunning any and all conservatives, idc if they‚Äôre friends or family, if you are a registered Republican voter, you‚Äôre not welcome in my home, this includes ppl related to me
It likely won't pass but one can never tell, they have a strong and growing voice. We must make ours louder
If they cared so much about children why don't they do something about poverty? And I mean this goes for both sides of the fence ü§∑ü§∑ü§∑ everyone likes to say how much they care about the children, but the only thing they do is fight over them
You can call or write your representatives and ask for their position on this bill. Let them know you are watching and make them take a position.
How is this bill going to effect children with same sex parents?
Unfortunately, there‚Äôs not many places for us in the world. It‚Äôs fucked up but the USA really is one of the best places for trans people
We are seeing the rise of fascism and that really scary I hope things get better and that people can get out if things do get worse
This.  A hundred times this.
I don't know about that.

They're calling the bill the ""Stop the Sexualization of Children Act"" and promoting it as an attempt to do just that. it has parts in it that are agreeable to anyone who hears them. But then also parts they will just gloss over and most people who aren't in the know will hear the agreeable parts and agree.
I would be careful saying that.

If Republicans hold the House and take the Senate, it absolutely will pass through Congress.
Even if it doesn‚Äôt pass, the fact is that it‚Äôs even up for debate is terrifying enough. And 100% indicative of where society is heading. Things are about to get a lot harder for LGB and especially T
U mean glock
exactly

that's another worry of mine.

Whether or not this bill passes it even being on the table is an indicator of things getting worse
The part in worried about is that they intentionally try to word it like they have honorable intentions and they include parts in it that sound like good stuff that anyone should agree to. but they throw in a few words and phrases which have their true intentions in them and gloss over that part so that reasonable people might not notice them.
Came here to say this. No updates since October and I‚Äôll pass before that does
Idk why it had to be brought up again specifically now‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs just scary that this can even be introduced at a federal level
I‚Äôm glad someone posted about it because I never heard of it. It just shows that they are testing the water to move up from state legislatures, in which they are having astonishing success.
I don't think we should blame people who choose to run for their own safety, but I also would like to see this ""stand and fight for what's ours"" attitude more in the trans community.
They'll keep it delayed until after the next presidential election then fast track it to be voted in by whatever Rep. gets voted in.

not to mention even it doesn't get voted in, the conservatives will use it as fuel against any Dem. candidate for anything. banking on the general public not knowing about the bill.

""So-and-so voted against the 'Stop the Sexualization of Children Act'!"" and Republicans and fence-sitters alike will eat that shit up.
I'm going to be honest.

I hope that ***doesn't*** happen again.

I don't want my fellow LGBT+ people to be killed by policemen in a riot that will most certainly turn the public against us. especially since said riot would make places that already dangerous for us hundreds of times more dangerous when conservatives start hunting us down to retaliate for the riot.

I honestly can't see any way a riot turns out good for us.
your first thing here they don't care about. the others are exactly the outcome they want.
Yeah I didn't like that they misrepresented and trivialized Florida's bill
K-3 means Kindergarten to 3rd Grade. It‚Äôs common shorthand for expressing a range of grades. If they think it means 3 year olds, they‚Äôre a bit slow (and that‚Äôs being nice).
Been doing this since 2020üòåü§åüèª
I‚Äôm heavily considering this when I get my own place
That's what they're hoping for with this bill. make LGBT+ people's lives and the lives of their families harder. try to make them disappear if they can
I‚Äôd say go to canada, but even the country starts to get ideas in the population

ironically, it‚Äôs not because of religious values, it‚Äôs because of the sexualization that is used as an excuse for hate against LGBT, at least on a Quebec level
The thing is that there is enough awareness of the blatant damage this does to children that a large enough quantity of representatives will be able to halt this. Hell the Democrats in government are almost unilaterally unwilling to vote on Republican bills because the Republicans aren't actually interested in governing in any real capacity. 

They can call it what they like but it limits speech; it invades privacy; its drives a wedge between parents, children, and their schools; it legislates upon issues that are largely meant to be personal, private, and between the individuals involved not their government or law enforcement. And there won't be a lack of pressure on those who are likely to find the disagreeable to disagree. Most of those serving in government have people in their lives and even own homes who this would impact. 

Also, for the record as a teacher myself, I sure as shit won't be letting the government tell me how I can and cannot support my students. Fuck that and fuck anyone who tries to get in the way of giving those kids a good education and the power to know themselves and be free. That is a love all kids deserve.
This bill is not expected to pass,, nor do they need it to. The real purpose of this bill is so that during the upcoming election they can say ""[democratic candidate] voted against the xStop the Sexualization of Children Act' that would do A, B, and C"" and casually fail to mention that it would also have stripped citizens of human rights.

This is a play to discredit rivals, in order to hopefully take back the legislative branch. Raising broad awareness of this bill's side effects is the best counter action.
If you‚Äôve ever read Mussolini, yeah that‚Äôs what fascism is basically. They hope people will gloss over the bad parts and enjoy the ones they put in for broad appeasement
I take comfort in the reality that the most vocal supporters of this stuff are also antivaxxers and the pandemic never really ended for folks without the vaccine. Antivax republicans are still dying every day from Covid they could easily avoid. The Republican base is dying of a disease none of them need to be dying of out of sheer hubris. 

I shouldn't take comfort in that. But here we are.
Dont cede that ground to them. Dont legitimize this attack. This doesn't have to be indicative of anything if we resist it. If we band together we will be much harder to impact. These are loud people yelling into a relatively quiet room. They're not representative of the soul of our country or species. We are capable of doing better and we must.
No. Christ, if I was going to shoot these dummies, who are oh so good at killing themselves, I'd at least use a better gun lol.
No.
That's how they got the angry orange cheeto elected in the first place. Now their god is about to be arrested and they'll need a new messiah. The violence that's coming after the indictment will hopefully wake the rest of the fence riders up. One third of this country would kill another third while the last third watches. We gotta hope they wake up.
You can introduce anything at a federal level. If I worked at a federal level I could introduce a bill to ban cheese and meat. This won‚Äôt pass. There will always be homophobia and transphobia, which sucks, but there will always be at least one person who has a way of thinking.
What success‚Ä¶ there is no ‚Äúastonishing success‚Äù here. They failed.
Oh I know. I‚Äôm just complaining because it sucks.
They don't even really teach any sex Ed til about 10 anyway. I was like 9 when I went through it. It was actually pretty underwhelming,  for all they made it out to be. Beyond ""don't let adults touch you there"", nobody is doing any of what they're worried about.

But we all knew it was never about the kids.üòÆ‚Äçüí®
I'm aware of that. It's when they mix that with talk about ""transing toddlers"" n such that they try to slight of hand people into picturing 3 year olds. It's a manipulative wording.

You kind of see this in action when Matt Walsh was on Joe Rogan, and Joe asks, ""They're doing this to prepubesant kids?"" And Matt replies,""minors yes. ""  They're trying to foster that association.

Anyone who pays attention or reads with any level of scrutiny will know what it actually says, but they're hoping to catch the average person off guard and convince them their kids are in danger. 

Words and phrasing order very much so matter when guiding an audience.
It‚Äôs very effective if you have kids, a little cruel maybe but I can justify it by the same justification I‚Äôd have for not allowing a rampant racist near my children
Aye a little difficult to do if you‚Äôre in shared living but you have every right to control who has access to you, your time and your home, I‚Äôm in AZ, and while it‚Äôs slowly getting better it‚Äôs still a bit of a cesspool on some issues, so I hung a giant safety pin in my window because all I can control is who has access to me and my home
I can't help but feel that, at least on a national level, the republicans have damaged the trust any other politician may have had for them so much that now *every* bill endorsed by conservatives is viewed with the expectations of containing deceitful wording.

Also: Go out and get yourself a ""#1 Teacher"" mug. You deserve one :)

Yeah but it‚Äôs also the fact that they‚Äôre pretty confident they‚Äôll get elected again after that
What planet are you on? Over half the states in the country have passed anti-trans,  anti-women, and anti-gay legislation!
Our first was in 2nd or 3rd Grade (7-9) and they just taught us about our bodies and what would happen in a few years. I wouldn‚Äôt even really call that Sex Ed but rather Anatomy and Biology.

We didn‚Äôt discuss safe sex and such until I believe it was 7th or 8th Grade (12-14).
Nah I‚Äôm a minor
Let‚Äôs be real hear the government regardless of political affiliation hasn‚Äôt had the nations best interest at heart in a long time, just their own pocketbooks and how to stay in ‚Äúpower‚Äù. I‚Äôm sorry but if you as a person are a career politician i automatically don‚Äôt trust you. It‚Äôs possible for me to like you as a person but still not trust you. The government and subsequently anything that gets funding from the government is all the same entity because they funding is dependent on them adhering to a certain parameters or agenda, because of that at minimum people should question their motives. Now teachers have a tough job and are left in a difficult position. I have family and friend that are teachers so I have a decent grasp of the struggles of teachers. Now that being said teachers use to just teach, give us the needed information and let us do with it what we will. If we had a question that was outside of the teacher‚Äôs subject yet we trusted that teacher enough to get an answer from them then either they as the teacher or us as a student would stay after class to get a one to one. Teachers should teach with an unbiased opinion as possible. This statement came to me directly from several teachers I had growing up and I think it should still apply til the end of time. As a parent it‚Äôs not the schools place to talk to my kids about sex or sexual orientation and identity, It‚Äôs mine and their mother‚Äôs. If after talking to one or both of us and they have questions we didn‚Äôt answer enough for them then maybe they can get an unbiased answer from the teachers at school. Growing up is already confusing enough especially during the teenage years but some of these schools are teaching child sexual identity at age 8. Most kids at that age are still playing highly imagination required games. Let them be kids. Hell I remember growing up, in kindergarten I would be the mom if we played house not because I was trans but because I spend more time with my mother, and I idolized her. I‚Äôve often wondered what it be like to be the opposite sex more out of curiosity than actual wanting to be a girl growing up. Let them become an adult before they make life changing decisions. Be supportive of them growing into who they will become. All this agenda pushing regardless of which political policy is doing the pushing, all it‚Äôs going to do is force parents to pull their children from schools and either enroll them in an alternative school or to start home schooling them. It will ultimately end the need for teacher as a profession at the public level.
Im specifically talking about the federal level‚Ä¶ your comment was very confusing in which if they were succeeding on federal or state level. Lowlife insults because of a misunderstanding, how kind of you!

Bathroom story	"A few years ago I was at a restaurant in New Orleans.  

I overheard a man talking about the bathroom bills that had just passed; he was in favor of them, and felt they would protect the children, or whatever.  He even thought the whole thing was funny, and was making the usual jokes about liberals, trans people, etc to the server when they brought him his beers.  

When then man was ready to leave, he signed his check and got up to use the restroom, only to find that it was out of service.  Without a thought, he moved towards the women's restroom, which was free.  The server stopped him --

""Sir, the men's restroom is closed.""

""I saw that, I'm just gonna use this one.""

""I'm sorry sir, that isn't allowed here.""

The man raised his voice, ""Are you kidding me?  I bought 8 beers from you, I gotta piss!""

""I'm sorry, but it's against the law, you'll have to go somewhere else.""

The man cussed at the server and stormed off.

The server came to apologize to my table for the disruption and ask if we needed anything.  On their way back to the kitchen, I watched the server go into the men's restroom, flick the lights on and off, then remove the ""closed"" sign from the door.  

When the server came back with my drink, I asked if the bathroom was actually out of order, and smiling, the server said, ""For him it was.""

Anyway, I've been thinking about that server as I see new bathroom bills being passed.  I'd never suggest it, but maybe it would be hilarious if men's restrooms in these places started getting shut down, by locks, out of order signs, potato chunks, etc.."	"This server deserves a medal of honor for being a TrueAlly(tm) !!!
*black and white chad* ""For him it was""
You better have given them a tip
OMG I love that! I‚Äôm not one to gloat, but it serves him right! I hope that server continues to do this to others like him
Y'no...I may just try that one day...
If i ever see this happen, I think I am giving that person my house! Wow what a beautiful story!
That is so wholesome. That server needs a huge tip!
That beautiful!
i dont think this happened but its funny nontheless
Yes and I'd leave a 150% tip on top of the 25% I always do.
I did!  I forgot to mention that lol
lol I‚Äôm not sure I would have believed it either if they weren‚Äôt my own eyes and ears."	11zau6h	trans	306	0.98	2023-03-23 06:04:45
Finally some good news for trans kids in America	California has just passed a bill making the state a safe haven for trans kids and supportive parents fleeing their states. They are unable to be extradited, arrested or sent back to their original state by force. Considering the large amount of trans refugees needing to find a safer place to live this is a great first step.	"Man now all they have to do is make it affordable to live there
It is SOOO sad that a state in the US felt the need to pass something like this.  I have the utmost respect for California in doing this.  And I think other states should be FORKING ashamed of what terrible FORKING precedents they are setting for the safey of our youth.  Seriously FORK THEM IN THEIR STUPID PIE HOLES WITH A BIT FAT WATERMELLON!
Rare state level W in the USA?
Yay! I can be accepted for who I am and then placed in a cardboard box under a freeway while some SOAD plays in the background of a zoom out from my sad, but super femme face.

I would be happier and more positive. This *is* truly fantastic, but it's prohibitively expensive for me to move anywhere, much less Cali.
Californian here! While everyone knows that San Francisco and parts of Los Angeles are perhaps the trans-friendliest places in the country, there‚Äôs lots of other cities to consider that aren‚Äôt STUPIDLY expensive! 

Specifically, if you‚Äôre considering moving here and don‚Äôt want to spend an arm and a leg (relatively), check out Stockton, Greater Sacramento, Chico, Indio,  and Eureka/Arcata.
I live in California. Sooo thats great California did this. Just so everyone wanting to move here knows. Its very expensive. Im trans and im trying to get out. Saving up to leave.
Good luck with that...
It's horrible that this is even needed, but I'm glad they've done it.
Ok uh sorry for posing under this random post but I can‚Äôt send posts here? Is that normal how can I do that since I am trying to ask some important questions
Visit California? Yes. Live in California? Never.

In spite of their trans-friendliness I could never live in that f\*\*ked up state. I already live in a (little bit less) f\*\*ked up state: Oregon.
Unfortunately I despise most everything else California stands for.  But cannabis and LGBT+ are good.  Everything else about California can suck it.
Problem is that the assholes aren't sending a letter to the cali government asking they had over the trans kids, it's cops calling other cops saying these parents are wanted for child abuse
i live in arkansas hahaha help me
Yeah. Everywhere we're accepted the cost of living is sky high.
The million dollar catch no?
Yeah Sacramento has become a very low key cool place! The neighborhoods around downtown sac are quite lovely!
Fresno as well. Rural town, parts of it can be dicey but it's more progressive than it was 20 years ago.
Why are they fucked up? I'm genuinely curious as we're likely looking to move our family to protect our trans daughter.
Shockingly, it‚Äôs because more people want to live in a sane society, not a backwards theocratic hellhole, so it drives up demand
Sac is where I‚Äôm from and where I live! On the whole, it‚Äôs just an outstanding city for the price. Easy access to SF and Tahoe, incredible food culture (helped pioneer farm to fork), greenest city in the States (by tree coverage), huge range of rents/housing prices, liberal and LGBT friendly, one of the best NBA arenas in the league, a huge amount of well-paying government jobs, the health care capital of California and beyond, an excellent airport‚Ä¶.

Sorry, I‚Äôm ranting. But Sac is such a friendly place for trans folk; I would highly recommend.
Fresno is okay. There‚Äôs certainly worse cities in California, but Fresno is repped by a Republican. Also, Central Valley farmers aren‚Äôt particularly known for their progressive views. Both of those make my trans sense tingle.
I live in Southern California (Can‚Äôt speak as much for NorCal) it has flaws as a major state, but I wouldn‚Äôt call it a horrible place to live.

It‚Äôs expensive as hell. Varies place to place, but Anaheim for example is 154% the average cost of the rest of the country. Also, the romanticized version you see in movies isn‚Äôt really- feasible. There are small sections of places that are nice, those places are like $5000+ a month for just a studio apartment. Everywhere else is low income, trashy, and some of them are what my friend kindly refers to as ‚ÄúPVP Zones‚Äù

Also, whilst major cities and college cities are liberal, not everyone is pro LGBT+. So keep that in mind if you plan to move. Nowhere is as violent or bad as some other states, but a solid chunk of the Inland Empire for example, can be questionable at times depending on the crowd.

Overall, I still am likely not to move. California comes with a hefty cost, but it‚Äôs my home. It has fairly easy access to trans care and it‚Äôs even really well covered by state insurance and pretty much all private insurance here covers it as well. It also has a ton of cool opportunities career wise that you may not have access to elsewhere. (I build set props and such!)

If you are used to a Suburbia, we have them, but that would depend on your budget. I can always help recommend areas if you would like depending on how much you were actually looking to spend! But even cities aren‚Äôt horrible, just a different experience if not used to it.
They also just keep building more and more housing for the rich here, instead of anything remotely affordable to the public. You can find something for under $2000 a month, but it‚Äôs likely to be a studio or really trashed one bedroom in one of the ‚ÄúPVP Zones‚Äù of our cities
Yes! I have family up there and go up for holidays usually. It's been cool seeing it morph from this sort of sleepy city into something that feels a lot more vibrant and cool!
There‚Äôs a transgender homeless shelter in sac isn‚Äôt there? I might move there for work at some point and was thinking of volunteering
True. Yes it's under Republican dominance, however it does have a sizeable progressive population, at the local level as well which helps to keep the wackos in check. From living here, I can say from my experiences that for the most part, people will leave you be if you don't bother them. That's good enough for me. The current mayor is a conservative, however he doesn't seem to want to target the LGBTQ groups outright. He allowed a pride flag to be hung during pride month this year on the city hall. While he could be doing more, he at least isn't a complete asshat.
Yup! Sacramento LGBT Community Center. I must confess I‚Äôm not terribly familiar with their work, but they‚Äôre widely seen as a force for good here. You‚Äôve also got the Gender Health Center which is a far-progressive organization that‚Äôs trans and POC led."	xsk02i	trans	262	0.99	2022-10-01 02:45:08
I'm scared for the future of the trans community	"This is going to be a full on personal vent, so uh, be prepared.

I'm 17. I started identifying as a trans girl when I was 13, back in around 2018. I'm not someone who was around for stuff like tumblr and the like, but I've been around trans subreddits, twitters, discords and the likes. When my dad would lambast me for my identity, r/traa was there to make me smile. When I would get shot down in my journey to acceptance and independence, I always had like-minded people to talk to.

But in the past year, I've witnessed public opinion sway against the trans community. And I can't lie: I'm afraid. I'm afraid for the little community of trans people, young and old, sharing their wisdoms and experiences. And yes, it is because of terfs.

When I was just getting into trans spaces, terfs were something like a mythological being - a group that are hard to find, like a unicorn, and filled with nothing but hate. But we never were bothered by them. But now, after the pandemic, the cracks in that have started to form, to the point where the innocence for me has vanished after the formation of the LGB Alliance and the process of JK Rowling becoming basically a cult leader. 

And I'm not disturbed because of old British white women whining about us. I'm disturbed because these viewpoints are reaching far. Go to any article about a trans person and you will see their ideologies spread. Hundreds of people are being indoctrinated into this hateful ideology, and fully believe conspiracy theories, like that all trans women can be separated into two categories, AGP and HSTS, based on their sexual fetishes. Or that all trans men are young girls who have internalized misogyny.

And it's not just cranky old republicans. They're always gonna be a hateful bunch. But I'm seeing more young left-leaning people also side with this belief. People will talk about extremely old-fashioned radical feminists, but they won't talk about the group of young radical feminists, that go from 17 to as young as 13, saying slurs, mocking people for being trans, and targeting trans women with femcel lingo like ""moid"" and ""scrote"". They are extremely radical, to the point I've seen unironic ""kill all men"" advocates in there.

And, as much as I know many people say these people are all straight, I've noticed that many of them are lesbians. These people speak of their experience in that early LGBT community, but act as if it was truly a mistake, and that things are better now that they can rip on trans people as much as they wish.

And the thing is that, despite the groups I'm in becoming more progressive over time, I've seen the community at large doing jackshit. There are hundreds of thousands of us - I know there's so much we could do if we went against orgs like the LGB Alliance or Fair Play for Women or whoever the hell, but no one seems to bother. I found out recently that people were demeaning the Loki series on D+ for having a genderfluid person fuck himself, linking it to AGP - and, as a trans woman, it felt so insulting that people were willing to bring this theory up as if it was some kind of old fringe theory when the guy who created it, Ray Blanchard, is still on Twitter throwing out the same old bigotry. They could do things about it. But they don't. 

And when you give them an inch, they go a mile. That is how we got to the number of anti-trans bills we've seen as of recently - even though, again, they are seemingly only given huge fanfare if they target gay people rather than trans people. High ranking liberals and democrats will put their pronouns in their bios, which are meant to signify respect and solidarity with trans people - but instead, they now seem to just service as more lip service among themselves.

I'm saying this here because I fully want people to give their responses. I've been holding a lot of this in, because other people seem to not know much besides ""jk rowling said this and that"", so when I say it, it feels as if I'm talking to a brick wall. I want to hear people's viewpoints, whether they are similar or different, and I genuinely want to know if we could ever return to that state of gleeful innocence that I remember from the pre-pandemic trans community. Because from everything I've seen of terfs, they want us to go back even further - to the 80s and 90s, where trans people were viewed as nothing more than weirdos in bars, gay people that went too far, or just as freaks you talk smack about in private. Not a great future."	"Dying beliefs & hatred are loudest right before they are extinguished.

You can see this throughout history from racism to womens‚Äô rights to gay marriage. Every single one of them went through the phase you‚Äôre seeing right now. Although it sucks and is demoralizing: They won‚Äôt win in the end. They never have, and they never will. Hate always loses.

It‚Äôs a dying belief system full of hatred that‚Äôs gasping for its last breath. Don‚Äôt give it attention‚Ä¶just let it die. It‚Äôs not worth your time or energy.
Don't forget that the LGBT movement started with trans people starting a riot and fucking up the NYPD. We're not to be fucked with
Believe it or not, it's still way better than it was in 90s. I know it can seem disparaging now, and that there are people like she who must not be named bringing it up every chance she gets, but before we were just hated, thought of as disgusting, and worthy of public ridicule, and not just by the cishets but the LGB community as well. Like when GLAAD praised a very transphobic episode of the Simpsons. I honestly couldn't imagine working where I am now with even so much as a single person knowing. Sure, I still have to deal with transphobes from time to time, but I'm at least in a position to not only to demand the same respect as others in my position, but also have the support of managers as well directors that insure people will face consequences for their continued hate.
Rowling is just an old crone past her prime spouting transphobic rhetoric in a vain attempt to cling to relevancy. 

To me, it seems like most trans people and their supporters aren't focused on the right thing. Identity politics, going on and on about pronouns, seem to take the forefront of people's issues. While being perceived as one's actual identity is important, I feel that the real issues that should be focused on are access to healthcare and legal recognition. It's easy to start a debate on wether or not trans people can compete in athletics as well, and often that becomes a main point of contention. But we, in the US, literally have legislation going through stating that parents of trans children are abusers. There is an active attempt to cripple reproductive healthcare. These are the things that trans people need to stand against. Its not easy to change public perception. Its going to take a long time. But first and foremost, we need to stand up for what is needed immediately - the ability to receive treatments wether they be hormone replacement, therapy, or reassignment surgeries or whatever. Before anyone can convince others that they are he/she/whatever, they need to be able to self actualize, and we are currently seeing a regression in the right to do so.
I'm scared for my community, we haven't even put our foot in the door to be respected and we have a lot of trans folk. DID/OSDD (traumagenic)

What gives me hope is the trans community and their ability to stay afloat. 

You guys and gals are professionals at helping me with gender dypshoria while cofronting with an alter who is of an opposite gender.

I scroll through these subs all the time for relief.

Don't let the flame die out, be persistent. Without you all, my hope for my community being taken seriously is gone. Completely gone.

Much love. Keep fighting.
History is in our side.  When slavery was banned there was a backlash.  When women got the vote there was a backlash.  When gay sex was legalized there was a backlash.   We grow more numerous day by day.  We are a strong community.  Human rights will prevail.  I am 49 and only transitioned socially a year ago.  I am the first transgender woman in the world in 98% male offshore windfarm construction industry so far as I know.  Every day we break into new fields.  We are establishing ourselves.  Be strong, stand up, demand your seat at the table.  Use your voice.  However, always try to be a role model so that others become more educated and aware that we are just people.  ‚ù§
It's like always, it's fear transform into hate. A lot of TERF are women who get abused, beated, >[raped]< by men. They wanted a group designed guilty. JK and people like her use the fear of these women to make a hate of trans women, who get designed the guilty group. That's why some TERF can change their mind if they encounter a real trans person. But some are way too far. Anyway, transphobia is transphobia and all TERF should face consequence, they are responsable to fall in this type of message
In my country they are a politician that is against trans/gay/muslim/jewish, by the ranking of the elections he is 2/3rd, im verry worry
I agree with all of this, and it's incredibly scary. But I don't think demonizing lesbians was necessary. Maybe I'm biased because I'm a trans lesbian myself, but a lot of the lesbian community is full of people who wholeheartedly support trans people, and are trans themselves. The majority of transphobes are cishet people. I'm just saying this because I really don't want trans people, especially trans men to be afraid of lesbians. The majority of us support trans folks fully! Of course there are outliers, there always are. But trying to pin the blame on lesbians specifically actually gets to people. I've had trans friends block me when they found out I was a lesbian and a feminist because they they thought it made me inherently transphobic, even though I'm trans myself.


Bottom line is, blame transphobia on transphobes, not transphobic lesbians/feminists.
If they don't like me, they'd have to kill me.
Laws targeting trans men and women in sports I suspect have an economic basis.  Billions of dollars exchange hands via sports betting.  A sporting event outcome could readily hinge on one individual being a fraction of a second faster or stronger.  Having a trans man or woman on a team makes it harder to guess the outcomes of various wagers. Those individuals most likely to bet big or cover those bets are likely to have undue influence on politicians and may want to eliminate our presence it sports, as no one plays sports for the sheer fun of it.
The natural counter has been here since Ren√© Descartes: Liberalism

Liberalism is slowly spreading and usurping the old value system in the West. Emphasis on slowly. The spread gained its first foothold in 1776, being brought from the realm of theory to practice. Then in 1789, it gained its second foothold, one which became a bastion of freedom. This bastion violently spread outwards in 1803, eventually being pushed back but not before cementing ideas. Ideas which resulted in spread throughout the Spanish colonies and the rest of the West. Then it sat and bubbled, waiting for an opportunity. In 1848, this came and the West was thrown into chaos as Liberalism once more violently erupted throughout Europe. After this it quietly coexisted with the old values until the 20th century, making small waves here and there on the way. Then in 1939 reactionaries violently attempted to overthrow it. In 1945 this overthrow was extinguished. In the 1960s, it gained majority and started enforcing equality for all. Ever since then it has slowly been building more and more traction.
That's something that keeps me sane at night. Not once in history has hateful ideologies like this actually win in the end, no matter how bad it seems. It will never be quelled, but we can survive.
You say that. Yet black rights are literally threatened by cops everyday under the table. Women's rights have and are being regularly assaulted as we speak with the bans on abortion, even for medically necessary abortions such as those during an ectopic pregnancy. 


We can't let the pattern you speak of convince us to let our guard down.

That said, I think the general value of what you said is important - we can't let the state of things demoralize us and prevent us from living as we are. As long as we continue to exist, fighting ignorance, living true and helping others do the same, they can't and will never erase us.


Squash these ideologies as soon as they pop up in your friend circles, or cut those people out. Expose their hate. They deserve to know that their shit is not tolerated and is looked down on.
[The Stonewall Riot.](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots)

Trans folks and crossdressers were at the forefront there, as were lesbians, etc.
If it seemed like I was demonizing lesbians I'm really sorry because that wasn't the intention at all! I just here a lot of people assume that they are all straight and white and I wanted to be accurate to what I see. Absolutely was not meant to disparage lesbians because I know 99.98% of them are awesome
I'll admit, this seems like an absurdly naive view of history. Social progress *has* been rolled back before. Women's rights and homosexuality got worse between the Middle Ages and the renaissance, for example. Slavery became more commonplace for a while etc. 

The fact things got better doesn't mean they'll go on like this. And I say *better* because the examples given are incomplete: racism is still a problem, women's rights are often purely nominal, gay marriage is only legal in some countries... I could go on, but basically: don't assume we'll win for sure. That's anything but a given.
**[Stonewall riots](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stonewall_riots)** 
 
 >The Stonewall riots (also known as the Stonewall uprising, Stonewall rebellion, or simply Stonewall) were a series of spontaneous demonstrations by members of the gay community in response to a police raid that began in the early morning hours of June 28, 1969, at the Stonewall Inn in the Greenwich Village neighborhood of New York City, New York, United States of America. Patrons of the Stonewall, other Village lesbian and gay bars, and neighborhood street people fought back when the police became violent.

Yes, but as I said, they will never be quelled. All of these examples in today's society are still way better off than before, and even with gay marrage and women's rights, at least there are countries which DO allow for those things, rather than a couple to NONE. Things will get better, maybe not soon, but they will."	tdojxa	trans	253	0.97	2022-03-14 03:57:23
I suspect the child I‚Äôm babysitting is trans; I want to help them.	"Prefacing this with using they/them because I am lost as to what to use!

As far as I am aware, this child is 12 and female, but they wear mens clothes, have a trans flag ribbon and gay flag ribbon on their backpack‚Ä¶ until recently. But no mention of being trans or gay and parents have not mentioned anything but would definitely be loving regardless!

Today was a really bad day, they didn‚Äôt want to do anything they normally like with me, said they wanted a certain food for dinner and then when we got there, didn‚Äôt eat. I offered to make baked goods at home, play nerf guns, everything. Nothing works. They hid all evening.

When the mom came home, she told the child not to be rude and that I was worried about them, but I clarified that everyone has a bad day and it‚Äôs okay!

Bottom line is that the strange depressive episodes and the ribbons taken off their backpack is lining up with all the new bills in Florida and Texas (we‚Äôre in a blue state though). But I think it‚Äôs weighing on them, and maybe body image issues too. 

For context, I‚Äôm white and bisexual but very new to the community, and the child is fab and mixed race Asian and Black. And I truly hope I used the correct language here, but I‚Äôm just looking for some advice or guidance. Everyone says I should wait for them to tell me, but it‚Äôs starting to seem like there‚Äôs possible mental health issues and I‚Äôm worried. I‚Äôve also known them for about 2 years, watching them on and off. Thank you so much in advance!"	"Find ways for the topics to come up naturally in conversation and make sure they know that you're supportive and safe to discuss such with. Never push or even ask leading questions. Let them reveal what they will or won't about their personal life/feelings
Going through the same situation with the 13 yr old I babysit/tutor. It‚Äôs a little different because I‚Äôm trans myself but anyway here‚Äôs my advice:

-don‚Äôt mention anything to the parent(s). If the parent(s) ask you, you don‚Äôt know (unless the kid specifically asks you to help them come out). 

-get a pin or something for your bag if you‚Äôre comfortable with that

-listen to them if they bring up anti-trans legislation, transphobia, etc. but don‚Äôt bring it up yourself. Instead, maybe (casually) mention some good news involving trans people. If the kid brings up any of the bad stuff, don‚Äôt say things like ‚Äúat least that‚Äôs not happening here,‚Äù instead go for sympathy and say something like ‚ÄúThat‚Äôs awful and very upsetting. Do you want us to look for ways we can help?‚Äù

-But most of all, be an open, neutral and affirming adult who is not their parent(s)/friends. This one is really all you have to do. Listen but don‚Äôt pry, but at the same time show that you‚Äôre supportive. 

You already sound like a great person for this kid to be around - Thank you. I‚Äôm sending you both strength and love.
Conspicuously read a a pro trans book of some type. Make up a trans masc friend. Hell, wear a trans ribbon/bracelet etc. As a parent to a teen though, she might be so in her head about the current political reality, that she may not notice. You might have to get real blatant with it.
Put a Pride pin on something of yours. 
Bring a book about lgbtq to read
Show acceptance without voicing it and show that you are safe. 

Outside of that, I wouldn‚Äôt approach other than being their friend and showing them you are safe an ally or a member of lgbtq+
approach it purely from a mental health angle

they may be a trans and lgbt ally but also there's a chance you're dealing with a cracking egg. it's a really scary time and attacking it head on is likely to make them run right back into the closet. voice your concerns as a fellow ally and see where they need help navigating what is happening to their trans and lgbt friends - cuz that might be all that this is

but

if you are dealing with a trans masc or non-binary person in crisis you have to demonstrate that any third party from the two of you is someone to be loved and protected from this onslaught. only then would someone be confident showing that the problem isn't in fact a third person but they themselves being directly affected - not just in crisis for fear for their friends.
Being trans can be a mind f*ck for a kid (at least it was for me). Even if you show your support, (which can be hugely impactful) they still might not want to come out yet.
She might be also tomboy lesbian and not trans! I'm trans woman Butch lesbian and also wearing men's clothes mostly, shoot guns, working around house with chainsaw, riding motorcycle etc.. Clothing is saying nothing about your gender identity.
i would maybe mention my sexuality/gender, make it known they are safe to come out if they feel ready, but like not just like say it explicitly, if you know what i mean?
I would just asked them about their flag and let them lead the conversation, and let them know you are LGBT as well so they know they they are in a safe space.  I wouldn‚Äôt lead the conversation, just let them talk.
Trust your instincts, but ultimately the parents are responsible (and liable) for their children's health.

Thank you everyone for your comments! You were all so helpful and accepting of my questions!

An update: the mom told me she knew the child is trans and they‚Äôre being very accepting but also trying to let them explore without judgement :)
Yes, I'd simply comment how much I like their pins and ask if they know anyone that's trans and kinda go with the flow
You're their baby sitter not their therapist. A bisexual adult woman talking about sexuality with a 12 year old isn't the right move in my opinion. If you feel the need to discuss these topics, by all means do so. The child isn't mine, but if it was my child I'd be furious if the babysitter I hired had that talk with my 12 year old.
Be careful!!!!
People already think lgbtq‚Äôs are pushing our agenda on their children.
Yeah that‚Äôs what I‚Äôve been doing, it just doesn‚Äôt feel like enough üòû
Yeah I second this. I know this feeling very well. The only reason I will hide is if I'm unsure of people's Intensions and thoughts. I won't make a sound. It's fear of ridicule and gossip.
Your message is really helpful and really sweet, thank you! I‚Äôm trying!
I think you misunderstood, the child I‚Äôm taking care of is likely trans. I‚Äôm bi
Fr I was so far in the closet, I would've supported anyone I'd known if they came out to me, but I couldn't find myself in there
I understand that feeling but trying to nudge them into saying it can be super uncomfortable and stressful for them 

Last year My mom (whomst I do not speaketh to anymore for separate reasons) kept asking me why I was wearing makeup, like asking loudly and making a scene. I think she would have been kinda supportive and I think everyone else would have been okayish maybe but still I didn‚Äôt even know my makeup was visible. Anyway she told me she was ‚Äúfine if I wanted to be a he/she‚Äù 

I had a slight bit of makeup visible and didn‚Äôt notice and now I‚Äôve not spoken to my mother in a year that was just the final ‚ÄúI need to leave‚Äù thing for me
It's more than a lot of people get. If they aren't cis they'll figure things out and ask questions. It's really best to just make sure they know you're safe to talk to
Srsly some kind of trans support item will 100 percent signal to them that you are safe
I don't think they misunderstood. They're saying the pins on the kid's backpack may just indicate that they're trying to be openly an ally, but it's also possible that they are dealing with internal questions regarding their own gender identity and that is most likely terrifying for them. 

They're trying to suggest that you indicate support for a different trans person, probably a trans masculine person as that seems like what you may be dealing with so this kid can know you would be supportive without trying to seem like you're attempting to figure out them out yourself.
u/ABewilderedPickle hit the nail on the head - i knew exactly what you meant and you need to show support for trans folk so that they either confide in you and you can provide help based on the fact they are trans or they show their hand and they turn out to not be trans - just a very-very concerned ally"	t3xnkt	trans	255	0.97	2022-03-01 03:06:28
Drinks are on me.		"That's so stupid, why would anyone care who you want to marry with, as long as they are consenting adults? I really don't understand conservatives, they are beyond crazy
Link? Interfaith and interracial should mean that we have enough collective people to fight back this one at least right?
Im going to need a lot more than one drink to get pass this. Probably going to forget it ever existed from how much im going to drink.
This is the future case to dismantle Ogberfell and Loving, just like Thomas said in the Roe papers
I just had some asshat telling me everything is fine and to move to Tennessee cuase ""adults don't care what each other does"". Told him that wasn't my experience and he continued to invalidate the things I've gone through and deny what's been happening. He was, of course, a white cis gay man. Gotta love it.
The 1960's called, they want to make America segregated again. Jesus fucking Christ.
interracial couples would banned?? That's honestly laughable. ""hey! you can't be with that person! they produce more melanin than you!!""
Well this‚Äôll get to be allowed by the Supreme Court and it‚Äôll really boil down to red states are red and if you‚Äôre blue you can‚Äôt vote‚Ä¶.and it‚Äôs back to the post civil war race for control over who can amend the constitution at will.
100% they are trying to force this to the Supreme Court to get the rulings on marriage equality overturned like Roe. They know this is going to be challenged in practice.
Aw hell nah. I‚Äôm gay trans and dating a mixed race man‚Ä¶. No way in hell are we staying in this god forsaken country
As a Canadian, I am sorry for all the awfulness.  Why can‚Äôt people just live their lives without trying to enforce their ‚Äòvalues‚Äô on other people?
May the fleas of a thousand camels infest the crotches of those who voted for it.

May their taxes increase a thousand-fold.

May their wives leave them and demand punishing alimony.

May their wealth evaporate into the night and the courts deny them bankruptcy protection.

I know it doesn't do anything, but the catharsis factor alone was worth it for me  
(And many thanks to the immortal Johnny Carson for the creative insults)
It would be great if there was a Satanist county clerk somewhere in Tennessee who happened to be opposed to Christian marriage...
We don't need drinks we need bullets.
Imma end up needing more than one drink... This stuff just makes me more excited to move to another state and start my life over come June/July
Can they just negate a federal law like that? I forgot how it works here bc our political system is so stupid
At least people can still leave the state, get married, and then Tennessee would be required by law to recognize their marriage.

It still makes me furious that red states are trying to take us back to the 1900's...

Interfaith and interracial too??? How did that happen????

Thus is bs. I'm not religious and at this point ehat even is interracial?? I might be biased since I'm mixed race and lived my entire life with people of many different races, nationalies, and so on, but isn't it really hard to not be in an interracial relationship?

I guess I'm glad I didn't grow up in TripleKVille.

This is insane. I can't understand this. I know they hate us but . . . what?? Race and religion??? They've thrown all pretense away a this point? I'm glad because now hopefully more people will see how insane and wrong extremism is but the people who will suffer??
Oh god unfortunately the USA must contain a lot of toxic people that such stuff gets accepted
Right-wing identity politics is about separating people into oppressed and privileged categories, and binding the privileged group to the ruling hierarchy.

That's the playbook since black and white folks were separated in the US after Bacon's Rebellion in 1676. Before then, many people that came over were indentured servants and free after so many years. The ruling landlords were scared by the working classes being united and created the legal separation of permanent slavery for black folks and free but poor white folks. This is well documented in ""The Invention of the White Race"".

All fascist politics rest on this method, from India where the BPP spreads hate against Muslims and tries to legislate India from a multicultural state to a Hindu state. The Nazis demonized Jews and went on to full genocide.

They denigrate the oppressed group, and spread fear of the oppressed among the privileged. It's nearly the entirety of Republican politics right now - spreading fear of crime and immigration as the polite form of racism. Oppressing women on behalf of ""the unborn"" (which they don't actually care about). They try to gain the loyalty of straight society by spreading fear about us.

It's a way to create and justify hierarchy, with the ultimate hierarchy being wealth and ownership.
WTF is happening to Merica?
Wow Tennessee!  Way to live up to the stereotypes we all already had about your state.
How did we take one step forward in early 2000s and take eight steps back recently
This still annoys me soooooo  much. All 3 are so ridiculous, but the most incomprehensible is‚Ä¶ the inter-racial ban?  Seriously???  Is Tennessee headquarters of the K.K or what?
Short version: conservatives feel that they‚Äôve accrued enough power to consolidate it, which is why you‚Äôre seeing these power moves from red states. Their motives haven‚Äôt changed since pre-civil rights but they‚Äôve had to hide their hand. Mix in the fascists (actual fascists) that have been working tirelessly to interweave themselves into American politics. 

Before the US was involved in ww2, there was a pretty massive nazi demonstration in (New York I believe?) and it‚Äôs not like these people just disappeared when we got finally did get involved. Also operation paper clip mixed in high ranking nazi scientists into positions of power here as well.

So in all, factions from the scattered confederacy, actual nazis, and homegrown fascists have banded together and have been working for this moment for generations.
As for understanding them, there is no logical point for you to begin. Their beliefs are purely constructed in base emotion.
IMHO, they're setting it up for a Supreme Court challenge in the hopes of getting Obergefell v Hodges 2015 (legalising gay marriage) overturned. Kinda like how they got Roe V Wade overturned...

From there, they will see about getting just about every other ruling in favour of civil rights curtailed or overturned.

I don't foresee the Court overturning Loving v Virginia 1967 as that case upheld interracial marriage and was the precedent used to uphold Obergefell - mostly because Justice Clarence Thomas is a cynical bastard who will happily sacrifice the rights of everyone as long as his right to stay married to his Karen of a wife remains in tact (Ginny Thomas is white, btw)
The more people fight over marriage equality, the less they fight over wages and corruption. Simple as. Kill the parasite, kill the problem.
If we arm them all, yes. And then we also have LGTBQ+ Allies and that will add more people. (I‚Äôm probably forgetting some people please remind me about them)
https://newrepublic.com/post/171025/tennessee-house-bill-gutting-marriage-equality
This is the goal. Republicans know they can't get these bills passed at the federal level. So right now they are writing and passing legislation at the state level specifically because they know it will be challenged in the courts and go all the way up to the supreme court where their buddies can dismantle all the progress we've made.
Thomas - a black man married to a white woman! Will their marriage be annulled?  Maybe that‚Äôs what he wants? ü§î
""First they came for the Socialists...""
You may laugh, but that is precisely what some white dudes be thinking...
Also the interfaith one. ""Yall can't be married! You have two different denominations!""

No no, we need drinks, preferably high alcohol volume, still in their bottles, and a lot of dish cloths.

I‚Äôll give you a whole crate of drinks, still in their bottles, sorry I lost the caps‚Äôn‚Äôcorks so I substituted with dish cloths.
It would have to be challenged and go to the supreme court, from there the supreme court would get to decide

You would think, but the annoying part is no, these people aren‚Äôt the majority.

Well. We did get Werner von Braun. Moon landing was pretty awesome and put a pause to a lot of world grief while boosting the economy. I'm so obsessed with space ü§§ I want to be the first trans girl in space! Kind of a side tangent but the operation paperclip reminded me of this.
Yeah I know it's not based in anything rational, i don't know why I asked tbh
This is what I‚Äôve been saying, they are passing as many bills as possible knowing they will be challenged in court.

Spam an already over burdened court system and hope that the supreme‚Äôs will support them. And if they don‚Äôt they Simple rewrite their bill with altered language and try again. 

These people are playing the long game and we need to do the same.
I don't think Thomas will vote to overturn Loving v Virginia (interracial marriage), but his equally disgusting putz colleagues (Alito - may the fleas of a thousand camels infest his crotch; Kavanaugh - that shit stain of a human being; Coneydog - I mean Coney-Barrett; and Gorsich - the pimple on the ass of a mule - and maybe Chief Justice Kennedy) might...
Ohhh‚Ä¶. My favorite topic. As someone in the black community (see my awesome avatar that I worked hard to create)‚Ä¶.. Black men have a history of kind of sort of voting against their best interest. Thomas COULD vote against interracial marriage and have a retroactive date AFTER his marriage was officiated. 

The likelihood of him doing it are honestly high. Some of the things he does & says are already against minority groups already‚Ä¶.. so I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised.
We need both. Fascists hate when fire is on them. It gives them disadvantage on their dex/con saving throws.

Unless they have feats that provides better contextual defense with those saving throws
I mean, the idea of being able to challenge a law in court for it's unconstitutionality is a good, but the problem is it requires the courts to act in good faith which isn't always the case
Always best to err on the side of caution. Things aren‚Äôt going great and these people are still dangerous, but there are still ‚Äòsafe zones‚Äô in the country. 

Unfortunately not all of us can make it to those areas.

I‚Äôm going to be asking Governor Gregg Abbott a question over the bill TX HB672 this Thursday which calls for the loss of trans children‚Äôs rights and will completely restrict hormone usage. I need good questions to make our presence know, and to make known how important this is.		"Your post has been filtered into a queue for further review based on a number of factors.
# Please be patient until your post is approved, we promise to get to it soon <3

*I am a bot, and this action was performed automatically. Please [contact the moderators of this subreddit](/message/compose/?to=/r/trans) if you have any questions or concerns.*
ask him if the state will at least cover funeral expenses for trans children committing suicide over ""not being abused""
Please be safe. Make sure there's someone with you.

You could ask him if he's read any of the overwhelming scientific literature that  supports trans healthcare, including in pubescent children. Ask him why he feels politicians have any business overruling doctors and medical researchers.
Call out his claims of indoctrination. Ask if stopping indoctrination in schools also means things like removing the ‚Äúunder god‚Äù part of the pledge of allegiance, and other Christian based things. If you can, expose this as pushing a political agenda rather than altruistic action.
Ask for evidence that this bill will actually help children. Make sure you cite at least a few specific studies that back up the fact that gender-affirming care is in fact helpful. Include sources that show the lack of access to such care is detrimental for both trans youth *and* the parents involved due to the higher suicide rates associated with lack of medical care. 

The easy part here is gathering the information as there‚Äôs thankfully a lot out there. The hard part is formulating the question(s) in a way that is concise and he won‚Äôt be able to cut you off or only address a small part of the question(s). 

I‚Äôm not sure what the format will be for this meeting, but make sure you follow the rules to the letter or else you risk being dismissed altogether. You can‚Äôt just have the facts memorized here, you really need sources to back up your words. 

It‚Äôs going to be hard, but Abbott is a master at deflecting blame and moving the goalpost in debates (meaning he sucks at debating, but that‚Äôs beside the point). You have to be ready for his inevitable finger pointing he likes to do with multiple sources backing you up. If you watch his governor debate with Beto, you‚Äôll see that these are the tactics he clings to. 

Good luck, and I appreciate you stepping up to speak for us. Even if you don‚Äôt convince him (you probably won‚Äôt tbh, he‚Äôs just too old and stubborn) swaying the people present is still important. The way forward isn‚Äôt convincing the old farts in power, it‚Äôs convincing the people who vote.

This is the bill that will consider transgender children as child abuse and will completely restrict the usage of hormones while being a transgender child in Texas homes.
I love you fren I hope you‚Äôll be okay, your very brave we need more people like you
Trans, fem-boys, and everything in-between has existed since our species began - Peacefully.

Why do they want to kill my wife suddenly? Why is the Trans community so scary now?

Ask him that.

I'm so happy I left Texas early. I hope everyone stays safe.
Ask him to explain what the bill is supposed to accomplish, and how it does that. If he gives a vague answer (putting power back in parents hands) ask him to explain what that means, and how it does that. 

Keep in mind his only goal is culture war toxicity and sound bites. Your goal is to get him to explain how and why he's a bigot. You don't win a direct fight, but by asking him questions that cause him to show his bigotry.

If you can, pivot once he's made it clear that he's restricting rights to,  ""if we can't trust you to protect this right, how can we trust you to protect other rights? How long before you decide the 2nd amendment is inconvenient?"" You don't need to believe it, just draw a parallel his base will understand.
As someone who has spoken at school board meetings (that's about as political as I get lol) remember to be firm but not rude, polite but not soft. If you can speak in a strong, unwavering voice, chances are you'll at least be acknowledged. Make them take you seriously because this is a serious topic.
Feel free to sarcastically apologize for taking up oxygen when we have so many other important issues to address - like the failing electrical grid, for example.

‚ÄúGovernor Abbott, your administration claims to be for protecting children. So why do you rip children away from their loving parents, and deny them life saving medical care?‚Äù
Will he be wearing his klan dress when you interview him? Maybe you could ask him what color panties he's wearing under it.
Ask him where he got his medical degree at. Ask him why villanizing one of the smallest portions of the population is so important to him. Ask him if this was a bill to limit children's exposure to religion if it was something he would vote for.
‚ÄúWhat makes your beliefs education, and other scientifically backed beliefs indoctrination?‚Äù
Well - I have a story, I don‚Äôt know if it helps you bc it‚Äôs not about trans youth directly. lived in TX for several years and went to high school there. My mom is there. I moved to New England a while ago and transitioned 20+ years ago. I‚Äôm a very experienced nurse. My wife is a teacher. We visited this past summer and had plans to move to Alpine.

At any rate, Godspeed friend.  Give ‚Äòem hell.
Ask him if he knows Marsha P Johnson, Alan L Hart (critical in discovering how to screen for tuberculosis), Angela Morley, or Carlett A Brown, all prominent historical trans figures, and if he doesn't why he thinks he is an expert on this topic. Ask him if he thinks the king of england should be writing our laws, or to put it in his terms if the Governor of California should be standing in front of you right now in his place. Ask him if he knows how a pre-puberty child transitions (which is entirely nonmedical) or the first dosage a trans child goes on according to WPATH or any other guideline for care. Ask him why he like more people to suffer, or who's bill this really is. Ask him why now, what's your motive.
Ask him how he thinks trans kids going on HRT is different from intersex kids getting surgery.
Will there be a place online for us to watch you ask these questions?
Call him out on blatant fascism and the genocide and violence bills like this will lead to.
Gov Abbott personally subscribes to many LGBTQ / Twitter / Quora and many more accounts including this one.

ask him if he's also going to restrict access to medical practices for cis people with hormone imbalances. and why specifically trans children shouldn't receive hormones, despite the overwhelming evidence of its positive effects.
I‚Äôd ask him why this bill is more important than (insert issue important to Texans).  If he paints it as protecting children than cite other issue that is more impacting to children (school shootings, healthcare, education, homelessness etc)
Ask him if he's happy to kill our youth
How does this law protect the rights of children, and their parents, to seek the medical care recommended and supported by doctors and other health professionals.
Damn.
This. 100% this.
Exactly what I came to say.
These are the questions that should be asked. Showing people science isn't going to help if they're stuck in their ways. 

Give him a dose of reality. Absolutely topple this ""ideal"" image of society the governor has in his head.
If it were me, this would be my question too.

I don't know if Greg Abbott is expecting any trans people to come, but if any do, he surely plans to make himself seem like the adult in the room. He's practically begging for a soundbite to throw into an SJW Cringe Compilation. 

So, don't give them that fuel. I understand why many of the commenters want to go for the kill given all the harm he's done. But OP, your goal isn't to ""call out"" anything. Let him call himself out. 

Be calm and rational, present facts, and force him to make his case for why bigotry is acceptable.
Good point- ask him if he disagrees with doctors over cancer treatments and other affirmative care
I like this but honestly people with these opinions don‚Äôt always do actual science or care what medical researchers say if it doesn‚Äôt suit their agenda (and let‚Äôs not forget the religious aspects that don‚Äôt always go with science). They  will subscribe to fake science or science that suits them, they could just ignore the question and answer in a manner that suits them.
The thing is, it's incredibly easy for them to hand waive scientific evidence as being produced by ""woke"" scientists with an agenda, and disregard its legitimacy. They'll find a single pro-trans article with bad practices, and use it to say that scientists are just being biased due to the influence of woke universities or whatever.

Logical reasoning and evidence aren't going to work against transphobes, because it's incredibly easy to cling onto tiny faults and then disregard any evidence that conflicts with their ideals. When people have such strong emotions and beliefs, it's very easy to deal with any logical cognitive dissonance by just ignoring it. Instead, you need to appeal to their emotions, and humanize our struggles. At least, that's what seems most effective so far.
This is probably the best course. Unfortunately, you are unlikely to change any minds in that room. But maybe the ripple effect will have an impact, even a small one.
Thank you, this was very helpful. I‚Äôll be going with some fellow friends and I hope to do the community proud.
Ooo this is good üòÆ
I‚Äôm not brave, nor pissed anymore, I‚Äôm just done. Im going to do whatever I can in my power to make my life and those of other transgender people better in what little ways I can.

Good one. OP should follow up with suicide statistics so they don't get laughed at by the ignorant conservatives for saying ""life saving"" tho. Always good to have a strong base to stand on when going up against these morons.

2022 is the scariest time to live in recently	"I am so frightened of 2022 it‚Äôs only the second month and there‚Äôs a on going war with Putin and Ukraine 

Not to mention Florida just passed the ‚Äúdon‚Äôt say gay‚Äù bill and Texas is trying to make it so they can prosecute parents for being child abusers if they are accepting of their transgender child 

Like things are getting worse and my heart goes to those in Ukraine and I hope your ok

And if you live in Florida or Texas and your trans or lgbtq+ in general I hope you stay safe as well and please remember you matter your not an abomination and you are valid and human like everyone else 

And these monsters that are in charge are terrifying and I wish we were moving forward but sadly we‚Äôre only going backwards 

And even though I don‚Äôt live in Texas or Florida it doesn‚Äôt mean I‚Äôm not terrified for LGBTQ+ youth but I‚Äôm also scared of the Texas trans law and Florida‚Äôs bill being in other places I‚Äôm scared that those will be put in place where I live 

Like we‚Äôre children we did nothing wrong why can‚Äôt we live just why

Let kids be kids and discover themselves 

I‚Äôm sorry for those in Ukraine and I‚Äôm sorry for LGBTQ+ youth in Texas and Florida"	"To be fair, the FL bill has only passed one of the houses. It still has to get though the other one.

And maybe it's my perspective due to my age, but this is still overall the best possible time to be trans in the US (a few states not withstanding). 20+ years ago, when I was in HS, it was a bad for us almost everywhere.

Basically what I'm saying is focus on the good. Don't ignore the bad, and still fight to change it, but don't let it consume you.
Sadly there is always bad stuff going on. Perhaps there's more than most right now, but it's always possible to feel overwhelmed from world events. There's nothing wrong with unplugging for a bit if it's too much.
I'm normally one who's able to realize that bad things happen all the time in the world, and aren't always broadcast on the world stage..

But something about this Ukraine situation just has me deeply unsettled, highly emotional, and just...afraid though I'd never admit to anyone I know in person.

Whenever I pay attention to current events happening in Ukraine, My body just shakes and I find myself holding back tears. Tears of fear but also tears of sadness, so many lives being lost and thrown away because of a fascist dictators lust for power and greed.. Russian.. Ukrainian... So many lives just being lost, but the bravery and courage of the Ukrainian people must not ever be lost or forgotten.

And so many trans hate laws trying to get pushed into effect, hate and violence towards trans people seems to be rising (though statistically idk if thats true but seems like it is)

People can say ""focus on the good"" but that does nothing but try to hide away the bad things happening as if its some dirty secret that must not be known. Ukrainian lives are being lost and the citizens are afraid, it's beyond insensitive to tell people during the brink of a possible World War 3 to ""focus on the good"" 

No we must focus and pay attention to current events, we can't keep acting like ""the good things are what matters""
Living in the us with what texas is doing ive decided to buy a gun cause the us is moving into facism. at least i can leave soon too
If you only let yourself look at the bad, you'll miss the good parts. The fact that these kind of...well, not laws so much as publicity stunts get noticed is because rights are so much stronger and more prominent than before. These kind of bullshit shenanigans wouldn't have made a splash outside of state news back when I was a kid. Now, it's a point of digust internationally. Even being heard is a big hurdle, and it's a hurdle we're cleared. Things are still moving in the right direction.

That invasion thing is, yeah, that's a kick in the delicates, for sure. We'll have to make it through, and that'll take courage. Courage is having a plan and following through. Take control to overcome fear. Find out how you can help, and do it. Follow your country's reaction and push for aid, make donations, whatever you can. You're more powerful than you may give yourself credit for. We'll push through this together.
when you want to be glad to not live in florida or texas but then you remember how much russia could fuck everything up soon
of course there are things that are not changing or even getting worse

but there is also so much stuff getting better. not to mention the things that are coming once the good part of gen z starts to take over this world. the lgbtqia+ community is growing and we will change things for the better.
Sadly, I‚Äôll never go to the US again. The country where I grew up, went to school and where we still have a lot of family - it‚Äôs incredibly heart breaking to see it turn into a backward, hate filled place :-(
15 years ago, the idea of coming out as trans seemed like it was impossible.

Things only get better through strife, no progress was won without enduring a scary situation to get there.
But I think your right I need to try staying positive through this horrific time and I‚Äôll try my best it‚Äôs just all this news is hitting me full force and it‚Äôs like I can‚Äôt breath
I'm a few years younger but even graduating (from a mid-west U.S.) high school in 2010 people were just coming around to the fact that ""gay"" or ""queer"" wasn't okay to say as an insult. There was absolutely no positive representation, and I thought I was a lonely weirdo, or ideally that other dudes had these thoughts. But no one talked about it...

Things are scary right now, there's no doubt that the world stage is using LGBTQ+ people to divide and radicalize.

Hearing high school kids on here talk about how there's a group of queer people at school that they hang out with is incredibly encouraging for the future!
I don‚Äôt mean this in any rude way or anything like that but I strongly disagree I think it‚Äôs one of the scariest times of being trans and LGBTQ+ because if these becomes laws it I have no doubt in my mind that this will cause suicide rates to go even higher because being outed when your not ready is already bad enough but also having a possible law being passed where you‚Äôll be separated from your supportive family just because some religious monsters see it as abuse is even worse because your taken away from your support system and they don‚Äôt even care about children they never have if they did they wouldn‚Äôt be doing this and they‚Äôd realize how dangerous this is but sadly they don‚Äôt and this is the world we‚Äôre living in
That‚Äôs what I‚Äôm thinking of doing because I‚Äôve had a few breakdowns because of what‚Äôs going on like I am terrified and I feel helpless and I wish this was all just a horrible nightmare and wake up but sadly it‚Äôs really happening and there‚Äôs a crushing weight on my chest the more I see and hear like the videos of peoples houses being exploded in Ukraine and then seeing videos of lgbtq+ people crying and worrying about the kids in Florida and Texas like it‚Äôs so much all at once and I just wish we could all be safe and not be in fear of our rights being taken away even more and literally dying
I 100% agree why should we only focus on the good like these are real things happening and we can‚Äôt keep ignoring it because that‚Äôs never worked like Ukraine is being attacked and we‚Äôre on the brink of WW3 and the rights of children and there safety are getting taken and the rates of suicide will only get higher and it‚Äôs heartbreaking
I might as well get one too
Sadly I‚Äôm 17 and haven‚Äôt been able to get a job because of medical reasons so I can‚Äôt donate even though I want to so I‚Äôm trying to share many posts from those from in Ukraine to those who can donate and who have a louder voice then me because I‚Äôm the eyes of anyone else I‚Äôm just a kid and I don‚Äôt know what I‚Äôm talking about and I shouldn‚Äôt worry but I am worried because it may not be effecting me but other people are being effected and I just wish this was just a nightmare and everyone in Ukraine was safe and alright but it‚Äôs not and overall the world has gone to shit this year
Please don't take this the wrong way, but you're clearly showing your age.

When I was growing up in the 90s and early 2000s, LGBTQ+ folk weren't accepted at many ""normal"" bars, even in Liberal NJ. Most states still had sodomy laws on the books. If you came out in HS you were probably going to get beat up if not horrifically taunted by your classmates. Being trans was considered a mental illness by the medical authorities that write the books. Coming out as such would cost you your job and possibly residence. Again, this was all in solidly blue central NJ. It was a hundred times worse in deep red states.

Now, most states include sexual orientation and gender identity in their anti-discrimination laws. ""Gay bars"" are dying because we're accepted pretty much anywhere. I, as a police officer, am welcomed by my department and 90% of my co workers. It's no longer a criminal offense to be LGBTQ+.

And you know what? 20 years before that it was even worse... The Stonewall Riots, over the fact that gay bars could even exist, were only just over 50 years ago. Even in super-liberal NYC, the NYPD had a ""public morals squad"" whose sole job was to suppress expression of LBGTQ+ people and values.

Yes, suicide rates are higher now, but that's across the board when it comes to youth, not just LGBTQ+ people.

I'm not trying to minimize the shittiness of these actions that FL and TX is taking; yeah these are bad and will cause a lot of harm if they continue to exist as proposed.

But overall, in the US, things are universally, factually better for LGBTQ+ people than any time in our history.
There's tons of good things happening in the world that don't receive news coverage. You aren't letting down anyone by focusing on the good things for a while for your own mental health. 

That being said fuck Abbot and Putin lmao
Exactly, This may sound rude of me to say but I honestly dont have much respect for people that say ""oh dont focus on the bad stuff rn just focus on the good"" because what that does is minimize the effects of said situation.

Turning a blind eye to Ukraine because ""oh we shouldnt focus on that, we should just focus on the good stuff happening rn in our country"" is just a stupid, shitty thing to do. Those are millions of lives at stake, a whole ass country/location being invaded and attacked, why the hell would you tell people not to focus on that and to not be afraid of what this means for the world? 

The world is quite literally on the brink of World War 3, all it takes is one single decision to be made and this world gets thrown into chaos, it wont just be Ukrainian lives being lost, but lives of many countries being thrown away for a war.

Russia aka Putin needs to know that the world is watching, and that the world is on Ukraines side, This is a situation that can very easily effect the entire fucking world. And if we go into World War 3, it'll the scariest time alive because this time many countries have nuclear weapons, and in war each side will be itching to overpower the other side, and Putin has made vague threats in regards to resorting to nuclear weapons this time around.

This isnt a time to be like ""oh dont pay attention to that scary stuff, instead pay attention to these good little puppies and kitties over here""
Look at that! You are doing something! I underestimated you. I think you know what you're talking. Being 17 doesn't mean you're wrong at all. It's just that I spent a lot of my life buried in fear and hopelessness. I've seen a lot of people get buried by it, too. It traps you if you don't fight it, and it doesn't help you to be weighed down by it. A positive attitude can do a world of good, but you have to build it, it won't just happen. You have to find the beauty in the world around you, and help it shine through. You're already doing that, and I think you deserve the rewards: optimism, satisfaction, and self-esteem. You make a difference in people's lives everyday, in ways you'll never see. Trust that it's there. The good things that happen in our lives aren't accidents, they're the efforts of people just like you making it possible.
Yeah plus it‚Äôs disrespectful and insensitive of those going through the invasion in Ukraine and everyone wants to turn a blind eye to everything like it‚Äôs nothing when it‚Äôs the most heartbreaking thing of the new year
Yeah I can't help but to cry everytime I hear or see a video showing whats happening in Ukraine, my heart just bleeds for them.

But Ukraine is tough, and their soldiers and citizens are becoming hero's. 

The world will not forget the bravery and courage that these people defending their homes and country have done.

Theres a recording of a russian naval ship telling an island of 13 Ukrainian soldiers to bow down and give up and if they don't they will fire upon the island.. and those Ukranian soldiers stood their ground bravely and told that Russian ship to go fuck themselves. All 13 of those brave soldiers died, but they died a hero standing and defending their country.

Then theres the Ukranian soldier who mined a bridge to slow down/halt russian advancement, he couldnt get off the bridge so he blew the bridge and himself up, a heros death, sacrificing himself to defend his home, his country and the capital of Ukraine and all the innocent civilians.

Turning a blind eye to the ""bad events happening"" is turning a blind eye to the heros and bravery
Yeah and the videos of fathers kissing there kids and hugging them for probably the last time is heartbreaking because yes there defending there home but it‚Äôs shattering to know that families are losing who they love during these times and my heart goes out to those out fighting and those who are seeking safety and hiding from the explosions
Its just awful whats happening, and I just hope any Ukranians in this sub know that we and the workd stand with them, and applaud their bravery.

Ukraine is a much braver country then the U.S, The Ukranian president is staying in the capital and helping the citizens as best as he possibly can, and doing all he can for his homeland... Meanwhile Senator Ted Cruz of Texas fled Texas because of power grid issues.

I hold so much love and respect for Ukraine, I just wish.. that this situation never happened

I‚Äôm Derek (they/them/he/him), and I work with patients getting gender-affirming hormone therapy over video. AMA about GAHT!	"I‚Äôm a queer non-binary member of society that has spent the last 33 years working to steer my life through the wild waters of the world and find myself in the process. Simple task right?

Finding safe and caring primary and gender-affirming care for us queer folx is a terrifying topic of conversation, especially in today‚Äôs political climate! As someone who has jumped around from doctor to doctor trying to find the right fit, I understand the constant battle of unpacking and then repacking past traumas.

I work at a medical practice that provides gender-affirming care and I answer our patients‚Äô questions about (but not limited to): insurance coverage for gender-affirming hormone therapy, billing codes, legal documentation, informed consent, what to expect when getting care over video, etc. Patients have so many questions and some have complex answers, and I wanted to share what I can with you all (but can‚Äôt share medical advice).

My goal is to assist fellow LGBTQ2SIA+ individuals find that safe place to discuss their healthcare and start their personalized journeys towards actualizing their true selves. I‚Äôll be responding to questions from 9am to 11:30am PDT today, so ask away!

UPDATE: Signing off for now! Thank you all for your truly great questions and the warm welcome into this community. :-) I‚Äôll check back in throughout the week, so feel free to leave any other questions or comments that pop up!"	"Hi Derek, thank you for giving this opportunity!

I have a few questions:

- Roughly speaking, at your clinic how many clients apply for gender care and what percentage of those get accepted (per year) as clients?

-is there an average and/or maximum time this gender care is given?

-If for whatever reason a clients decides to discontinue treatment and effectively wants to detransition, does your clinic have a protocol on how to deal with that?

-Working in this line of work must have huge ups (like truly improving someone‚Äôs life) and downs (like dealing with bigots). How do you (and your co-workers) stay healthy of mind?


And last, not a question but I want to thank you for helping making the world a better place for all of us‚ù§Ô∏è

1.) If you want facial feminization surgery how long should you be on hrt before getting a it done?


2.) As a 30 year old, can I expect any significant changes to my face, hips, chest from hrt alone?


3.) How long will it take me to lose muscle mass in my arms?


4.) Will hrt stop fat from being put on my stomach?

Hello Derek I am Josie,

Thank you for doing an AMA here. I personally am 18 months on feminizing HRT and I am 37. I had my orchi done at 12 months and FFS will be next summer with additional referrals sent out for top and bottom surgery that I am now waiting on consult dates for. 

What advice do you have for the older population who is transitioning? Anything from the social elements to planning your medical transition would be appreciated. It was incredibly overwhelming to start and I only recently really feel like I have a handle on all the intricacies of dealing with insurance and doctors, society, and my peers within the community. 

For me what seems to have really helped was creating a master document to have all my research and any supporting documents (letters, consult notes, surgical notes etc.). Additionally I have started a visionary board to start compiling my personal style and aesthetic goals.

Finding my voice was imperative to my transition so far. I believe I have struck a good balance with medical providers regarding being firm in my expectations but understanding of the limits in place in the medical community. When red flags presented I quickly sought out alternative providers. Can you elaborate on what are some tell tale red flags and when it is appropriate to fire your care provider/surgeon/endo? 

I could easily ask more questions but I have voice therapy shortly so I have to get prepared for that. Thank you for doing this and hopefully it is helpful to some of the folx here.

I‚Äôm most curious as to what the 2 and S stand for in the acronym and why + wouldn‚Äôt cover these 2 mysterious additions.
Are you Veritassium?
Do you have any inside info on the (most recent) injectable estrogen shortage?

I recently had to switch from once-a-week injections of Depo-Estradiol to twice-daily sublingual estrogen pills. I've *heard* that there's just a single company producing it in a single plant, but I don't know the reason(s) behind the shortage, what (if anything) is being done to address the situation, and when we can expect the estrogen to start flowing again.

Hi Derek!

I'm curious, with the rising risk of bans and other barriers to GAHT access in the US, do you see a possible future in which the DIY scene and mutual aid networks begin to replace traditional healthcare again for trans folk, as we saw up until a decade or so ago?

What do you think that would look like? What are things you worry about or would want the community to work on if that began to happen?
Nebraska estrogen for me I've been transgender for a few years however in Lincoln I can't get the hrt I need
Hi Sylvia, thanks so much for your questions!

* The goal of the practice I work at is to provide safe access for GAHT via telemedicine to anyone (over 18) who needs it! Right now, the large majority of patients coming to see us are a good fit for care, but there are limits to telemedicine. Depending on if the person is taking certain medications that are better monitored in person, for the safety and wellbeing of the patient, we may ask they follow up in person. This is all on a case by case as we want each person to form a personal care journey that best fits their needs!
* There really isn't an average/maximum time that we would be able to see a patient for care. Our goal is to continue to provide treatment for as long as someone needs :)
* If at any time a patient would like to discontinue treatment, our providers are there to help every step of the way to make sure it's handled safely.
* This is definitely the best and most difficult part of what we do every day. My coworkers and I respond directly to patients chatting in with questions, so we get to be there with patients during all of the amazing moments in their journey, but are also there during difficult times! We definitely get some bigots, and we just have to remain positive, remember what we are working toward, and be kind. I think we all know people out there that have bigoted mindsets due to fear, so remaining kind is always the best move (in my opinion haha). The good always outweighs the negative, so remembering all of the positive changes I've been able to be a part of, really helps keep a healthy mindset!

Thank you for your kind words!
Hi BunbunTheJackalope! Thanks for reaching out for some guidance :)While I would really love to answer your medical questions I‚Äôm limited to how much advice I can give on a public forum without you being a patient of ours.

Every patient's transition is super unique to them, as it happens on a different timeline as well as with differing goals. It's really important to keep in contact with your medical provider on a regular basis to get answers tailored specifically to your personal medical goals and desired outcomes. Are you currently with a medical provider that you're comfortable asking these questions? 

I know that's probably not the answer you‚Äôre looking for, but I hope that it helps point you in the right direction!
Hi Josie! Thanks so much for taking some time to chat with me today! 

It sounds like you have already taken so many amazing steps in your journey! From what you‚Äôve described above, your organizational skills are something to be applauded here. A vision board and master file of documents that you‚Äôre collecting is great!

You‚Äôre right that it can be an overwhelming process to get started as well as maintain. I think it's extremely important that you find a medical provider that you‚Äôre comfortable working with and would recommend to always advocate for your care goals. As I‚Äôm sure we all know, the medical system is a bit behind the times. So finding someone that you can grow and learn with, in a comfortable space is imperative! It sounds like you‚Äôre not afraid to ask questions and challenge the system, and knowing when to allow the system to also catch up to you.

If you feel uncomfortable in a space, then know that leaving is always an option. If a provider doesn't make you feel heard, or if you don't feel safe to share important information with your provider, that is a big red flag. Trust your gut and know that you have options. 

I want to thank you so much for posting such amazing questions for others to read and learn from. You have undergone a lot of things and giving others the opportunity to learn from that is amazing. Hope voice therapy goes well ‚ù§Ô∏è

The 2S in the LGBTQ2SIA+ acronym stands for Two Spirit which was proposed to be added by Elder Myra Laramee during the Third Annual Inter-tribal Native American, First Nations, Gay and Lesbian American Conference, held in Winnipeg in 1990! Though the ‚Äú+‚Äù is there to include other groups within the community, the 2S was added to shine light on Two Spirit individuals. :)
Hi BuddyA! 

We partner with the UCSF hospital system and they‚Äôve observed every 2 years or so there's a shortage of injectable estrogen. We do however try to assist our patients with prescription reroutes (where we have the provider re-send a script to a different pharmacy) with the hopes of finding a pharmacy that will fill the prescription as soon as possible. 

Keeping our fingers crossed that the estrogen starts flowing again soon! ü§û
Hi Maya! 

I‚Äôm so glad that you‚Äôre here and that you‚Äôve asked this question. Coming out can feel like the world is caving in on you, but it's also one of the most rewarding experiences ever. The anxiety you‚Äôre experiencing is totally normal, but remember that you know who you are better than any other person! I would love to also hear from other members of the community on how they‚Äôve navigated this as well! You have an incredibly supportive community standing with you, welcome home.
What's the point of doing an AMA and not answering any questions?
I am currently being prescribed hrt through an informed consent clinic. I goto a planned parenthood over 2 hours away because it is the closest one. The doctors providing me with care unfortunately are very busy and rarely are able to answer the phone to answer any questions and I work to much to be able to make the trip to the clinic more than once every 3 months.
I think instead of adding to the acronym we can just start saying + by itself to include everyone and not worry about someone not getting light shed on them or not, everyone is just included in +, and then no one can feel left out because everyone is equal under +. So the new acronym for the community could just be the + community. Inclusive of everyone, gay bi lesbian trans intersex 2 spirit asexual queer all represented under just one amazing mathematical symbol. Simple and beautiful.
Thanks and ü§û!
I mean, the answers to these questions are all very different depending on the person, there's really no way to accurately answer them without even knowing the person asking
I‚Äôm so sorry to hear that! You deserve the best care and you deserve to have a doctor or provider that you have access to! Always know that you have options.
Some other informed consent practices offer care over telemedicine so you don't have to make the drive to the clinic. Some offer in app chat as well as have teams for patient support to answer any questions (that‚Äôs actually my job üòâ)"	wxcces	trans	203	0.97	2022-08-25 12:00:59

Oregon introduces a bill that will mandate that insurance covers ALL gender-affirming care!	"[Here is the source.](https://twitter.com/ErinInTheMorn/status/1628641691832918016?s=20)

EVERY single senate democrat cosponsored the bill.

It would mandate that insurance covers ALL gender-affirming care - surgeries, hormone therapy, FFS, hair removal, everything. 

It joins 3 other states who do this (Washington, Colorado, and Hawaii.)

In light of the slew of anti-trans bills being introduced, it's nice to have a few wins. (Erin goes more in-depth in her blog posts.)

ETA: a detail."	"I'm in CO. we're still working out the kinks on this, but so far it's been going well
Finally! A state that's moving in the right direction!! The rest of you 46 States could learn something..
I am sososososo happy to see other states doing the opposite of the red crazy states.

A few years ago I was looking to move out of state and start a new exciting chapter of my life. Lately, I've been seeing the # of states I could move safely to shrinking one by one, with the list being all of 4-5 I'd feel comfortable with.

I am thrilled to see another state *officially* become an ally.
Fuck yeah. This is why I live here.
Jeeze this is even better then Canada and i was suprised how much was coverd up here !
Love to see some beautiful beautiful wins!!

I'm really scared.	So many bills are being passed. I am 14, and I am getting so close to starting T. So fucking close. But I live In a red state. I'm scared that one of those bills is gonna come here next. I don't know what to do. It's like they are trying to erase us. They don't want trans people around and I don't know why.	"I understand how you feel even in a blue state I'm terrified that in a splits second all my safety is going to be compromised. Sends hugs and support as a queer ally. No one should have to feel this way. Stay Strong! We're all with you on the right side of history.
Are your parents supportive? If so,  you might want to share your concerns with them,  and discuss options.

If you live near a blue state, you might be able to see a doctor there? Though I'm not sure how that would work, exactly.
Stay strong! You're too young to vote, but you can sign petitions call your Congress people and march in protests. There's way more caring people out there then haters, we just have to organize better.
Why because the LGBTQ community is the rights  latest boogy man or woman (remember only 2 genders) to distract the ignorant masses that make up their political base.

Easy to say, but hard to do: Stay strong and know there are people who love and support you for who you are even if you don't know them.
In some states that have banned doctors from treating trans youth, some people have managed to get/stay on treatment with help from doctors on other states. They travel across state borders for treatment or meet with doctors via zoom, and have prescriptions filled by out of state pharmacies and mailed to them.

It's a really scary time. But you may have options even if things get worse in your state. Good luck.
These bills are blatantly unconstitutional. If they pass and are unchallenged, they prove there is no real rule of law in the US, which ought to be a surprise
Remember that a lot of these bills aren't actually passing - they got to pass both the state senate and the state house, both of which get days to debate them, and then a govener can veto them if they manage to pass both of those.

There's certainly a lot of bills getting introduced but many of them don't have a chance at passing. Republicans are just introducing them because their entire platform is based on scapegoating and hate, and we're their current target.
i'm 28 and terrified. i'm right there with you.
I'm scared too.  You're not alone.  We can get through this together, I truly believe
Stay strong.  Yeah, it's really scary.    I barely avoid trauma spirals glancing at the news some day.  We just have to vote (when you're old enough) and make support networks for our safety.

Stay strong. There are so many people out there who support you. I know that is easier said then done but just stay strong.
Try not to let them get you down. Try to explore potential options out of state if needed. You deserve the best
So sorry for you hope it‚Äôs gonna be all right
I understand your fears. I find myself spiraling down that line of thinking as well and often feel trapped living in a red state, feeling like any moment is when a bill will be announced and inevitably passed. Even as an adult I feel this way, but I can only imagine how much more terrifying it is living as a minor with even fewer options. 

One positive I can say with confidence is that I know most of these people passing these bills are older generations. It's a morbid way of thinking about this, but they are going to start dying off soon. Younger generations have a more open mind in general when it comes to gender and LGBTQ+ rights from what I've seen, and soon those younger generations are going to start voting and out-number the older generations.

Also, I know that in my community alone, even though it's considered a red state, our local library, community college, high schools and even a Christian  church hosts an LGBTQ+ safe space/club open either to all ages or 17 year olds and under. And those were just the ones I'm aware of. If you feel safe doing so, I'm certain there's at least one of these groups in your area where you would be welcomed and you could bring up your concerns. It might even lead to a bigger movement to fight against bigotry against trans rights and try to educate the community.

You definitely don't have to suffer alone, it's for the younger people that don't get to have a voice that I still try to fight for and while it might not feel like much, I think people are more willing to accept us than they were before. Some old dickheads with power don't like it and that's why they try to take our rights away, but there are people out there that definitely aren't going to take that sitting down. It might be disheartening to see so much negativity, but I feel confident that we have allies and our older transgender siblings that are going to keep fighting so that we can have a future.

Please don't give up on your future. It is a scary and uncertain time to be transgender as a minor right now, but whatever hope you still have left inside of you, please hold onto it with all of the strength you have left. Don't let the bastards win.
It's okay! I know how bad it looks, but I and many more will continue to fight for you and our rights! This kind of stuff has happened before, and people fought back then, and now we are here. Stay strong! ‚ù§Ô∏è
You‚Äôre 14 so you‚Äôre probably unaware but the Republican, conservatives or the right wing are anti democracy and have always despised lgbt people. They don‚Äôt like progression they‚Äôre regressive‚Ä¶ they didn‚Äôt like rights for women back then or black people and they don‚Äôt like rights for trans people today. my advice is don‚Äôt worry consider leaving the United States when the time is right. For now educate yourself on trans rights and medical care and hang in there everything will be fine just know you‚Äôre not alone in the struggle‚Ä¶

My parents are supportive, mostly my mom, but we might be able to convince my dad. We live in stl, right next to Illinois, which is conveniently a blue state. But insurance is also an issue.
What the fuck does that even say. Learn grammar before you try to talk to me.
I don't have the insurance for that :(
Yes
They'll get through if not stopped.
That was extremely condescending, but thanks for the 'support' I guess.
You sound like my stepdad
Man you sound insane, in a sane way. And that's not a good thing. I have known I was a boy since I was 9, I came out at 11, I know what I want and I know what is right for me, not cis straight white men up in office. I am not being influenced and I'm not becoming a ""slave to big pharma"" and ""current trends"" the fact you even called it s trend is disgusting. Yes I am 14, but I am educated. And hormones aren't permanent, it is reversible, so even if it isn't right for me I can just unfuckingdo it.
Amazing. Literally none of what you said is true or based in truth.
Yeah... hmm.

I did find a Planned Parenthood in Fairview Heights? It looks like they should offer HRT via informed consent. I started out that way (MtF, though).

I also found a link to a local trans group-- looks like they have a resources section for local medical care, too:

https://www.stlmetrotrans.org/
Check out Southampton healthcare in stl!! They are relatively affordable, without insurance, labs are the big cost of it without insurance tho, but the doctors there are great!!! They also have a ton of resources for trans ppl, including references to therapists and the like, def check em out!! I go there too, my doctor is AMAZING. You got this, supportive parents are a huge plus!!!
Not sure what you are upset about. You asked why people are anti trans. I answered it. Sorry I missed the apostrophe in the right's but auto correct has a hard time with it.
You said you didn‚Äôt know why I wasn‚Äôt being condescending you‚Äôre young and probably unaware of all the horrible things the right does I‚Äôm sorry for assuming but you literally said I don‚Äôt know why
BTW, the only 2 genders thing is sarcasm related to the way conservatives look at gender.
[deleted]
Ok I'm sorry, the way it was phrased I thought you were a conservative trying to explain gender üò≠ my bad, I'm sorry!
How can you say know then be surprised when they go backwards that doesn‚Äôt make sense it‚Äôs literally they‚Äôre poster boy is regression‚Ä¶.
Sorry about the confusion.  I'm actually a diversity fellow but also on the Spectrum, so sometimes what I mean doesn't sound right to others.
Dude just leave me alone, I appreciate you trying to help, but you aren't helping

Utah Bill to Block Birth Certificate Gender Marker Changes - URGENT ACTION NEEDED	"UPDATE: The bill has been pulled.  Thank you to everyone who helped us kill it!

UPDATE 2: The bill has not only been pulled, but the sponsor has agreed not to reintroduce it this year.  It's dead.

HB0135 currently before the Utah State Legislature aims to block transgender Utahns from being able to change the gender marker on their birth certificates.  This bill needs to die ASAP and is going before committee today.  Many of us will be at the Capitol fighting valiantly to stop this, but we can use all the help we can get.  Please reach out to your representative, and spread the word to others to do so as well.  If you live in one of the following districts, we especially need your voice.

\- These are our swing votes today for Committee. If we can get 3 of these representatives to vote no, we can kill this in Committee today.

&#x200B;

House District 11 (Riverdale, Washington Terrace, South Weber, Uintah) your Representative is Kelly Miles. His Phone Number is 801-458-8270

&#x200B;

House District 17 (Kaysville, Fruit Heights) your Representative is Stewart Barlow. His number is 801-289-6699

&#x200B;

House District 19 (East Bountiful) your Representative is Ray Ward. His number is 801-440-8765

&#x200B;

House District 45 (Northern Sandy) your Representative is Steve Eliason. His number is 801-673-4748

&#x200B;

Calls from their home districts are the most influential way to change legislators minds. PLEASE take a few minutes to call your legislators today. The committee meeting is at 3:40, please call before then. Please be polite, but share a firm message that this bill hurts transgender Utahns - a personal story if you have one, and finish with asking for a NO VOTE ON HB153.Thanks! Together, we've got this!"	"wow. fuck our garbage state. also, if i live in the provo area, who should i call? i want to help
Sometimes I wish we could change the state we were born in cause of shit like this.  I'm fortunate to be born in New York and not Utah, but many other trans people aren't so lucky..
Ok, where can I see for myself that the bill was pulled? I believe you but I just need to see it for my own sake.
I don't know that the status has changed yet on the legislature site, but I just spoke to several committee members after a different press conference and it's not only pulled, but the sponsor agreed to trash it completely for this year.  It's going to a study committee, so we still need to watch out next year.  We are safe for now though."	aqhawl	trans	142	0.99	2019-02-14 07:33:46
Things are really bad y'all, like really really bad. And they're only getting worse. But we can make change, we have to generate public outcry, call our reps, organize, protest, make the world listen. We cannot let these bills keep passing with relative silence.		"Not a legal eagle, is there any chance of these getting struck down in court? Hang in there all, and don't give up. We won't take all of this.
land of the free unless you slightly differ from the average
cis people dont give a shit about us. the only way ""public outcry"" is gonna get generated is if it starts affecting them too.
I sincerely hope there are teachers there who outright refuse to use pronouns for *anyone* just to make a point. All students just referred to as ""the student"" til school boards get sick of it. Just malicious compliance until they eat their words. 

The medical care bit though... that shit's rough. I'm hoping doctors pull together for a joint lawsuit claiming that it interferes with care and causes undo harm to the patients.
Yeah, we‚Äôre all silent cause we‚Äôre to busy fighting over a damn video game
Huge government overreach from the party of freedom? That's America for you.

I'd call my reps and sign petitions if I could but I'm European. I'm signal boosting all I can but I have zero reach especially because I haven't come out so I can't use my regular accounts. I wonder if there's any other ways I can help that won't out me...
I wager it's being challenged or will be challenged. It's an unconstitutional law and very discriminatory. As scary as this all is, I know that it's temporary. Rainbows always appear after a storm.
There is a case out of Texas that would ban the second drug used in medication abortions (which constitute a large majority of the procedures) across the country through a nationwide injunction (doesn't matter if abortion is legal in your state).  That would be a huge over-reach and assert judicial supremacy over the executive branch among many other things.  I believe that if medical abortions fall, contraception would be right behind.  I think that would be enough to get cis-people in the streets and potentially reverse some of this state terror against trans people <I hope?>
The drag bans are illegal under the first amendment. They are overly broad and don‚Äôt actually define their terms to an extent that would be unenforceable under legal theory. The medical bans for minors are less clear cut but still a good case since they are interfering with medical care. The one allowing people to misgender people in schools will stand most likely, for the same reasons drag bans are illegal. Unfortunately that knife cuts both ways."	10yax42	trans	145	0.99	2023-02-10 00:15:11
New Hampshire is looking to pass an anti-trans bill	"The bill seeks to clarify that men and women are only to be treated and recognized as such if they are ‚Äúbiological women‚Äù.

You can find the state reps, and their emails, off of this address. Feel free to let them know your thoughts. 

https://www.citizenscount.org/elected-officials"	"Well, I doubt this is going to pass, given that majority-Republican House and Senate passed (and the Republican governor signed) the 2018 gender identity nondiscrimination law that this law attempts to roll back. So I doubt this has enough traction--but again, New Hampshire is weird and stranger things have happened.
It‚Äôs always funny to me that the aggressively ‚Äúlive free or die‚Äù (more like ‚Äúlive cheap or die‚Äù) state pulls authoritarian bullshit like this
I swear its like almost every state is passing these nowadays. Indiana is trying to pass a bill that stops trans girls from playing in school sports and the house and senate passed it already

‚ÄúLand of the free, if you‚Äôre like me‚Äù


Time for anarchy :)
The only thing to do is to write your rep now, when it‚Äôs happening. 

And then vote later. 

Unless you go a lot of time on your hands and then you can try to get others to do the same.
It stirs up the conservative base and no politician gives a fuck about trans people enough to really go to bat for us because we are such a low percentage of the voter base. Trans people only have the rights we have because it is hard to not read laws discriminatory against women as also discriminatory against trans people. 

But if there is some landmark case saying it is ok to discriminate on the basic of identity, then expect all of those rights to go away. 

That is what this bill seeks to do. It‚Äôs red meat for the Republican case who wants to see a minority oppressed or shoved back in the closet. 

‚ÄúFuck those freaks, I got an election to win.‚Äù

If you do not like it, then write a NH state rep.
I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôs real hot to throw the word ‚Äúgenocide‚Äù around. Just call it what it is: Attempts to make ignorance and hate the law of the land.  Legalized oppression of a minority.

Cis people should care because once it happens to trans peeps, it‚Äôs going to start happening to other minorities.  Every advance since the revolution can be rolled back if no one says anything.

Don‚Äôt write it up on Reddit. Write a NH state house rep. I did. I recommend a cordial but firm tone.
Buh-b-b-b-but it's basic biology! /s

We need your support in Texas!	Currently there is a bill being heard that would equate all trans related care for minors to child abuse!	"I‚Äôm in Arkansas where they just overrode a veto to make it illegal for children to transition, to make it to where healthcare providers can turn us away for ‚Äúreligious objections‚Äù for ‚Äúnon-emergency‚Äù care, and are now trying to pass a law that allows us to be sued for using our preferred bathroom. So you completely have my support and I‚Äôm hoping that the Supreme Court dismantles these laws before they spread too far.
I‚Äôm in North Carolina, so I feel your pain. It‚Äôs a good time to remember your state representatives and let them know you don‚Äôt like this. It‚Äôs either that or cry while staring into the abyss.
I live in Pasadena, Texas. If you need my support in anyway I'm here to help!
That freaking sucks, hopefully I could support  my fellow trans here in Texas by my 18 bday
Although I live in NJ (A very democratic state) I have your full support. If these bills pass, you could move north east. Just not to New Hampshire.

idk your age but if your younger than 14 your not certain of anything.Children are not allowed to be intimate with adults becaase their minds are not fully developed.theyre not ready to make adult decisions
No it effects teens to. It makes it so teens can't even get puberty blockers which will completely dick over those people in the future and is kinda the reason a lot of trans people don't have super successful transitions, forcing kids through the wrong puberty instead of just letting them pause puberty till they make up their mind on going through with transitioning is pretty fucked and only makes everything worse for trans people. Also if its anything like Arkansas bill it also makes it legal to deny healthcare for trans adults as well so its a bit of a issue
who tf brought up child-adult relationships
Nobody said anything about intimacy with adults. We are talking about people being who they are. You do not know each person‚Äôs individual situation, so you do not know if someone has the mental maturity to make the decision to transition. Someone could be 30 and not have the mental maturity. Just because you are under 14 it doesn‚Äôt mean you aren‚Äôt mature."	mpcmfd	trans	138	0.99	2021-04-12 12:17:45

New anti-trans bill in Tennessee makes Aladdin, Mulan, Hercules, Emperor's New Groove, The Lion King, The Jungle Book, Robin Hood, Lilo and Stitch, and many other Disney movies illegal. These are all our movies now!	"The new bill in Tennessee bans any content for kids with drag. This includes a LOT of Disney movies. Why do conservatives hate classical kids shows?

Aladdin - Both Aladdin and the genie are shown in women's clothes

Mulan - the whole damn movie.

Hercules - Pegasus turns himself pink and has makeup on

Emperor's New Groove - Emperor Kuzco is seen in drag.

The Lion King - Timon does a whole bit in drag

The Jungle Book - Baloo dances in a skirt with a wig on

Robin Hood - Robin Hood and Little Jon both crossdress

Lilo and Stitch - Pleakley puts on a wig and makeup

Why is Tennessee canceling these Disney movies?"	"Lmao, guess we own all of these now
Includes episodes from Naruto, Gilligan's Island, SpongeBob, Clone Wars animated series (plus the movie), M*A*S*H, the first Pirates of the Caribbean movie... The list goes on for quite awhile.
I would love to see the look on their faces when somebody points out that this would ban like half of kids media.
Not as much as conservatives are the kings of unintended consequences. Take, for example, the law passed, which allowed the ten commandments to be posted on government property. Imagine conservatives surprise when the church of Satan was approved to erect a similar religious statue. Or apparently the ""don't say gay"" bill in Georgia that was recently defeated, with help from the Baptists oddly enough, because it was worded in such a way that would have outlawed conversion therapy.
Wait... This also includes the Looney Toons because of Bugs crossdressing XD
Do the movies fall under these restrictions? I could only find it as regarding public performances? Or do movies also fall under this..

Regardless this is fucked up, just trying to clarify whats going on. English is not my first language.
I guess Gilliad strikes again üôÑ I saw the bit on John Oliver about what happened in FL . It's really becoming ridiculous.
Did the bill go into effect? Or is it just on the ballet
Ironic really, these are some of the best disney movies from the 90‚Äôs-2000‚Äôs era
lol. These special snowflakes will really find anything to be upset about. If a movie has 1 second of wearing a wig ban it. The USA is truly on a different level of insanity. Just imagine them canceling the Bible because Men wore dresses and \*gasp\* is that a rainbow!? that's recruitment
The Lion King? I must be forgetting something.
Guys, a swat team raided my house to see if I have these movies
Wonder if we could convince that one trans Disney legacy to sue over this
WTF ARE THEY EVEN DOING
Are these films actually being removed?
We should get a werewolf - I mean, lawyer - to sue someone for showing these movies in Tennessee.
The pink horse in Hercules was Pain and Panic, not Pegasus. But Pain and Panic are male so I guess it's still drag.
this is just hilarious to me lmao

aladdin is now adult media
No Bugs Bunny either lol
The conservatives saw the future and ran screaming back to their caves...
> pegasus turns pink and puts lipstick on

Did they...did they watch the same movie I watched? That was Pain and Panic, Pegasus was just a weird bird/dog the whole movie lol

There's a whole story arc in One Piece where a character has the power to control hormones. Which I think we can all agree, is a fucking rad super power.
They wouldn't care sadly
Lol, I love the Satanic Temple always using their own stupidity against them.
This is true. Florida accidentally banned the internet once while trying to eliminate gambling.
If the film is screened in public, I would assume it would be banned under the law.

Privet or home video screenings would be exempt (not banned)

Really? You have to go to a adult movie night to see Aladdin?
Which makes no sense, btw. The official rating should be 13+ since that's when it's ""acceptable."" For ""sexual behavior being implied."" They act like it's porn.
They‚Äôre putting chemicals in the water, to turn the frickin disney gay.
Ban the people/government. The swamp puppies did nothing wrong.
It's dangerous for minors.
The official rating on Lion King is ""G"". That means General Audiences, all ages. Don't let them move the goal post one inch!

My egg cracked and holy f***	"Hi everyone!

I‚Äôm new to the sub and on a new account because it‚Äôs a new me :). So sorry if this breaks any rules but I wanted to write this.

So I (26, mtf) and my girlfriend (24, cis) had been talking about marriage for a while and originally it was supposed to happen by the end of the year but last month I told her that I couldn‚Äôt do it because something felt wrong. I still love her, want to marry her, want to have kids with her but there was just something really holding me back.  I thought maybe it was my depression or anxiety but that didn‚Äôt fit the bill. 

So last weekend, the day after my 26th birthday I‚Äôm on my way to get a mandatory Covid test for work/school (stay safe, wear your mask) and I just kept thinking why I wasn‚Äôt doing it. Something about moving forward made me so unhappy but it wasn‚Äôt her. So I kinda tried to think through things that typically elevate my depressed state and everything kept going back to me being unhappy with me. I wasn‚Äôt the person I wanted to be when I grew up. 

Back in third grade I knew I hated my body but I thought it was just because I was bullied for being overweight, but then I lost about 60-70lbs over 2018-2019. But that wasn‚Äôt good enough. So I started working out my arms and pecs to get more ‚Äúattractive‚Äù and that still didn‚Äôt make me happy with myself. I was the right weight, had pretty ok muscle tone and size, and was actually mentally and physically healthy for the first time. But I still didn‚Äôt like who I saw looking back in the mirror. I saw the sharp edges, the muscle, the beard, and the amount of body hair; and that‚Äôs when it just clicked. I was objectively a healthy, fit..ish, semi attractive guy...and I fucking hated it. 

And then everything from my past just started flooding my brain: idolizing everything about Jane from Disney‚Äôs Tarzan (I still have a collectible statue of her and a picture of old me meeting her after the show in Animal Kingdom), dressing up as Belle from Beauty and the Beast as a 7 year old, always wanting to play the bride in fake weddings, and the constant wonderings of how random situations I find myself in would be different/better if I was a woman. So after a two hour panic attack, a Klonopin, and confusion about the very clear puzzle I had just put together, I told my girlfriend everything. I am a woman and want to stay with her forever and start our family...just with two moms instead of a mom and dad.

Her response? ‚ÄúI knew something was up. Especially after receiving an ad about freezing and donating sperm.‚Äù She‚Äôs going to stay with me and go to all my therapies and even if I lose friends and family I‚Äôll have a new one with her.

Everything is now just so clear and I constantly switch between these euphoric feelings of my life moving forward and crippling anxiety over the costs of sperm freezing, therapies, possible surgeries, and what my friends and family will think of the new me. I just hope they see I‚Äôm still the same person just looking and feeling right for the first time. 

Any advice anyone has on this whole process, workouts I can start doing, foods I can eat, and mental exercises to keep the anxious thoughts and imposter syndrome at bay would be amazing. Also is there a subreddit for mtf/cis fem couples so we can get advice there too? 

I wrote this during a euphoria moment. I‚Äôm ready to upgrade to the real me. The last model wasn‚Äôt working for me.


TLDR: Didn‚Äôt propose to my GF, discovered I was trans after still not liking my body after years of working on it to conform to maleness, came out to Gf, she is staying with me. I‚Äôm very anxious but euphoric and excited to be the real me. We plan to get married and start a family."	"Stay true to yourself and remember, slow and steady wins the race. Once you start hrt, avoid foods with a lot of potassium,  since your body will want to keep storing it. Enjoy the ride and if you are planning on children, freezing sperm is a good idea
Stay strong. It will be a wild ride, and there will always ups and downs, but being true to yourself makes a huge difference. And if you ever need a shoulder to cry on or an ear to talk off, we're here for you.  
Chin up. You are loved, you are valid.
I know how you felt. I thought all of my problems were related to stress in school... then I started getting really bad anxiety attacks sometime after i graduated. I couldn‚Äôt explain it, since I thought I had everything I wanted, including my dream job. 

Then, I finally admitted to myself what the real problem was and had always been. I‚Äôve been happier ever since, even as tragic things had happened. Those things are just easier to face when you can laser focus on the issue and not have it compounded by something else.
I'm in a similar situation with my wife, except no plans for kids and we were already married. My wife is on r/mypartneristrans, so if your wife is willing, she might find some good advice and support there. Other than that, all I can suggest is open, honest communication between the two of you.
I'm so happy to read this, this makes me so happy too. The ""everything feels great but something was off"" feeling and then your egg breaks..
[removed]
Similar situation here, but we were already married for four years. Made it really hard to tell her but she's okay and calls me her wife and we plan to have kids still. Congratulations on figuring that out and living your true self!
Welcome to the fam lil sis
This is solid advice! I want to do this healthily physically and mentally. But for this I just feel so committed.
What do you mean by that? That your body will want to keep storing potassium? Why does this happen?
Thank you so much! I know the journey will be long and difficult at times and I‚Äôm going to be getting regular therapy but the end result is being happy. I am so thankful this community exists :)
I totally get that! As soon as I said it out loud to myself and came out to my girlfriend  we immediately had a three hour talk about the order we want to do things and when to start seeing a therapist to talk through all these new feelings. It‚Äôs helping me to brace for the challenges ahead.
Thank you for this! I will definitely point her towards this :)
It's literally on the bottom of the post
Thank you! I can‚Äôt wait for my GF to call me wife! The whole kids part is making us nervous but hopefully we can freeze and store for when we are ready. Best of luck to you and you wife!
I believe it is caused by anti androgens
Dude back off him. He's only up to picture books right now.
Thank you! So far I'm on the fence about HRT for myself and so plan to try to procreate the cheaper way and then see where I've landed. Both options have their risks though. There's always a chance things could get rocky if I start HRT and it changes our relationship after we've decided to have kids together, but in our case there isn't a ton of extra time to wait on kids either and my dysphoria is mostly centered on things hormones don't affect.

Nurse looking for advice	"For context, I work as a triage nurse at a healthcare facility in Canada. 

When a patient‚Äôs number is called they approach my desk and I ask for a piece of photo ID and their healthcare card. During my shift yesterday a M to F trans woman came to our facility. She gave me her healthcare card and I inputted her number into the system. Her name pops up, let‚Äôs call her ‚ÄúMelissa.‚Äù I then proceed to ask my questions as usual which start with ‚Äúhello, do you go by Melissa? My name is ‚Äú____‚Äù and I‚Äôm a registered nurse.‚Äù She was extremely offended and replied to me ‚Äúyeah, what else would I go by? I paid a lot of money to be called that.‚Äù I apologized and explained that I ask everyone what name they go by and if I don‚Äôt know how to pronounce it, I ask that too. She didn‚Äôt seem satisfied with that answer and I truly felt awful. 

I was hoping for advice going forward as I want to be welcoming to everyone who comes in. 

For those wondering, I ask that question because often times a person‚Äôs full name pops up like William but they then tell me they prefer Bill."	"Sounds like she just took your question the wrong way. I imagine most people meeting a triage nurse are under some measure of stress, I wouldn't take it too personally. 

Maybe as a note, instead of asking a patient to confirm that they go by  the name on record, ask them if they are ok going by their full name? That way it less implies that she'd have another name, and more implies that she might have a preferred nickname?
I think what happened here was a misunderstanding. She likely thought when you said ‚Äúdo you go by‚Äù that her previous name had come up on the system with her new name as a note. ‚ÄúDo you go by?‚Äù can have a sort of ‚Äúnot your real name‚Äù implication.

You haven‚Äôt done anything wrong, but trans people who‚Äôve changed their legal name often continue to encounter their old names in computer systems even years later as everything catches up and it can be frustrating. It‚Äôs happened to myself many times.

Even though this didn‚Äôt happen, I think by the wording of the question she may have thought it had.
Healthcare environments tend to be extremely transphobic 

I probably would have reacted the same way. Im not proud of that. But my anxiety tends to manifest as irritability and medical spaces are the #1 triggering place 

But nurses and doctors do have an obsession with names, asking about them, using them as conversation starters, etc

I theorize its bc its one of the few ways to connect with patients and make them feel like A Name and Not A Number in an efficient way.

Like... I was talking to a receptionist to see my HRT doctor and she complimented my deadname. In my manly ass voice I laugh and say ""well *I* dont care for it"" and she proceeds to dig her heels in like ""Well I like it. Its so unique blah blah blah"" I can see her having a similar conversation with a cis person, but the fact that im trans it *feels* like shes saying something else. Like... I should go by my old name and gender 

Or when my doctor burst into the room and asked very loudly if my deadname was German. Startled, I said i don't go by that name and said my preferred name. She would not fucking let it go. She HAD to know if it was German. And then she ended it with ""But i will call you your preferred name since that is what you preferred to be called"" which again feels like shes saying something Else. like my preferred name is not my name.

So yeah... These are just the ""innocent"" interactions. Where the other person is just being ignorant, but it still takes a lot out of me. Im not even talking about the time a doctor gave my mom an anti trans book. 

My guess is this womans guard was already up and she was expecting some fuckery

Also... She wasnt lying. Its like $500 for a name change where I live. I can definitely see why she'd get defensive about that. Especially when she probably went through a lot of shit and red tape to get that name legalized, and then for people to call her that, so yeah

You just stepped on some toes. It happens.

EDIT I don't think you should feel bad or ashamed or anything like that, just be kind and compassionate towards that lady and yourself ‚ù§Ô∏è

EDIT These conversations im talking about are not ""confirming my legal name"" conversations.  Those also happen, I literally have to deadname myself to Geico like, the concept of people needing my legal name is not lost to me Ive been doing this for 10 years. Im SPECIFICALLY talking about medical staff who use names as icebreakers / to connect with patients bc its the first thing they see on your chart thats personal. And for trans people that shit hits different, especially when you say ""i dont like that name and i go by x"" abd they wont shut up about how great it is or IS IT GERMAN? why would anyone think a doctor needed to know if my deadname is german to avoid getting in trouble like.... I clearly was not talking about when they are forced to confirm my legal name, im talking about when they try to make a whole ass conversation out of that. Literally no one else i have to reveal my deadname to is this specific kind of weird about it. It is truly a medical staff Thing
I kind of get why she might‚Äôve been initially frustrated, but that‚Äôs a ‚Äúthink for two seconds and realize it wasn‚Äôt an attack‚Äù situation, not a ‚Äúget pissy about nothing‚Äù situation. You absolutely did the right thing asking, and it‚Äôs a shame she didn‚Äôt do the right thing by being respectful.
I think you're doing a great job already, responding to this by taking it in stride. If the point of asking is about nicknames, so I'd go with something like, ""Should/Can I call you ____ , or do you go by a nickname you'd prefer?"" But I also know that's a mouthful to say every time you see someone. At the end of the day it's possible this particular trans person was putting up shields early to avoid being hurt because something *like* this has happened to her before that has lead to discreet or overt discrimination. It doesn't make what she did less rude, and I don't think it makes your response ""wrong"", either. Best of luck moving forward and thank you for your excellent allyship!
I think you did a great job. I don't think you need any advice, unless it's to not let shitty stuff thrown at you by people with a chip on their shoulder ... get to you. That woman doesn't get a pass on being a walking anger bomb, just because she's trans.
It sounds like a normal question to me. My name is three syllables that is frequently shortened, including by me.

There may be ways of finessing the question, but I don‚Äôt think you did anything wrong or offensive. You were taking steps to be respectful. Hell, when I taught, I saw different pronunciations for names than I would have expected, and I‚Äôm sure you come across that, too.

Does you chart system have a field for preferred name? If not, maybe you could suggest one. I do legit feel more at ease when I see signage that somewhere is queer or trans friendly. That might also help defuse similar situations in the future?

I‚Äôm sure you know patients are often stressed when talking to triage. It could easily have been stress that made her react how she did.

Thanks for caring enough to ask.
I'm a trans woman in Canada who recently dealt with the local ER.  Their system does have a spot for preferred name.  The triage nurse and the doctor I eventually saw were good about using my preferred name.  That was it for the good in the whole visit.

Most of the rest of the nurses and staff didn't give a shit, just barking out my deadname at me and pointedly ignoring corrections and rolling their eyes.  Sheer anger at the poor treatment kept me awake.  I was there due to massively spiked blood pressure to begin with so the bulk of the staff were actively aggravating my condition by stressing me out.

My legal ID finally changes over later this month.  I wouldn't be surprised if some bigot digs my deadname out of the records and tries to address me by it, which will be a fiasco because I don't even attend to my old name anymore unless it's clearly directed at me.  It's not my name.

I don't think you did anything wrong but when most of us get treated like garbage by hospital staff all too often, yes, we can be touchy and assume the worst (it usually is after all).

Probably adjusting your phrasing and/or tone would help get trans folks to relax as you interact with them.  Just keep in mind that even if you are a delight, odds are high at least one of your colleagues will be openly rude and bigoted after the patient moves on past you.
You did nothing wrong, I‚Äôm sorry she treated you that way it wasn‚Äôt ok. Try not to take anything personally, as getting healthcare as a trans person is incredibly stressful. We deal with a lot of transphobia so we‚Äôre on high edge. Just the other day I went to the GP after a legal name change and the receptionist was annoyed at me and said I have to always book it under my old legal name not my new on in the future. I said I‚Äôd like to be able to book under my current legal name on my healthcare card and she got so angry at me and refused to update my details. 


In short, we‚Äôre often on very high alert/edge in healthcare situations. Never less you didn‚Äôt do anything wrong, she shouldn‚Äôt have acted like that over what you said.
Consider rephrasing it to ‚Äúour system has your first name as Melissa, is that correct? Do you have a nickname or preferred name I can add?‚Äù 

The nuances of ‚Äúfirst name‚Äù, ‚Äúsystem‚Äù, and ‚Äúnickname‚Äù will communicate to most people (trans and others) that you are being thorough, not judgmental. If offense is taken, I think you can assure yourself you did your best and sometimes people are just raw or misunderstand. Communication is hard.

But also, don‚Äôt bother adding the preferred name if people aren‚Äôt going to actually use it because that hurts even more. 

(I notice almost everywhere I go in health care in Ontario they now do use my preferred name even though I didn‚Äôt legally change it, but this is pretty new. Thanks for reminding me to ask for it with doctors I‚Äôve been seeing a long time.)

It means a lot to know to know a nurse is coming here for ideas on how to be more affirming and respectful. <3

I hope you are no longer feeling awful. You meant no harm. You apologized. You acknowledged your true intentions. You came here because you want to do better. 

All we can ask of each other is that when we know better we do better, and in my opinion you‚Äôre doing great. :)
Some people just want reasons to be mad
I get that they paid money but there tone of voice from the sound of it seemed harsh. In my opinion, I would prefer if somebody asked.
Not much you can do differently, she just over-reacted.
Just here to pile on the support wagon. You did nothing wrong. In fact, it sounds like you did everything the best. 

Keep up the good work! Thanks for being an ally!!!
Don't worry, seems like just an individual instance of someone being insecure. What you did was perfectly fine and respectable.
I don't get her problem, aside from triage stress,my name is Alexis if you said exactly that id say yeah that or Lexi, whatever is easier!also mtf
She sounds annoying, you did nothing wrong lol
You did nothing wrong. 

I can understand how people would have a defense set up especially after being mistreated, but they need to then go to therapy to realise that not everyone is out to get them and to deal with what happened in the past. You were respectful and didn't mean anything by asking that.
Try "" Hello, Melissa. Do you go by Melissa, or do you have another preferred name?"" . My name is Anastasia,  but I go by Anna most of the time. Melissa could go by Mel or Lisa. Does her answer go into a shared file? I told my cardiologist that my name was Anastasia,  but then when I saw my new GP, since I was presenting as Anastasia,  he called me Anastasia. My cardiologist made a note in my file that my GP saw and read. That was my first visit with him.
Yeah we‚Äôre pretty touchy about getting the name right.  Maybe a better way to say it, is, ‚Äúyou go by Melissa, correct?‚Äù  Or its says here your name is ‚ÄúMelissa‚Äù is that correct?
I think she just misunderstood. Maybe say something like ‚Äúdo you prefer another name?‚Äù Or ‚Äúdo you have a nickname you would liked to be called?‚Äù
I think you were appropriately respectful and did a great job; it's truly awesome that you came here looking for ways to improve:)

That said, it sounds like that patient was just a jerk. Being trans doesn't give one special license to crap on people because they made the most minor of faux pas. ALL people have things that are triggering. As other reasonable people have mentioned, just consider the situation (a public, high-stress environment) and move on to the next patient.
I think she may just have been having a bad day ü§ç I really appreciate being asked because I‚Äôm not the kind of person to go out of my way to bring up my name change. 

This is a bit unrelated but I‚Äôve been wanting to share this with someone since I found this. Here is a link to a LGBT care guide for nurses that I discovered when I was in my LGBT studies class. I really like it and it has some great information if your interested : ) thanks for being an ally 
[LGBT nursing](https://nursejournal.org/resources/lgbtq-key-terms-and-definitions/)
They were rude. Anyone knows you always confirm a zillion times the patient and information is correct because if it's not can be legal hell. My nephews birth certificate says mother race black... my sister is not black. So just as an example say can you verify your information so I can update it in the system, an any reasonable person wouldn't be rude about old information that is medically necessary for treatment. Not trans. Might get some flack here but also hormones for cis women make em a Lil emotional at times... now imagine people in transition.  Everyone should stop being so touchy about others politely trying to do their jobs.
In fairness to the dr, and it‚Äôs a shitty system, but in my experience, medical stuff is a lot of confirming your info on record to make sure they have the right person. So if your deadname is still in the system as your legal name, that‚Äôs the name they need to have confirmed. Which, again, sucks majorly if it‚Äôs also a deadname that hasn‚Äôt had a chance to be legally changed. There are probably better and worse ways to handle asking the question, but they do have to ask or they‚Äôll be in trouble.
The receptionists opinion doesn't count. She's hired by the doctor or the organization she works for. Tell the doctor to change the record. If the name on your healthcard is your now legal name, they'll have a fucking hard time billing the system to a different name.
Like i am totally fine with people confirming my legal name and understand all that (even if it personally sucks for me). I am an adult so unfortunately there are many situations where I have to use my legal name (when like... paying my internet bill or getting a car insurance quote etc etc) and that is not what im talking about in this comment. 

im specifically talking about how in medical environments the staff use names as conversation starters and focus on them a lot as an easy way to connect with patients and how that feels as a trans person
Specially when they have to bill the government. During my last visit to the Endocrinologist, my govt issued health card was flagged. The receptionist asked me if the card was current (obviously it was, the expiration date was printed on the card). She mentioned it might happen if someone else's charges were billed to mine. I immediately came home after the visit and called the hotline. The person asked me some security questions, and said there's nothing wrong with the card, and the current version code was correct. She also said I could fill up a form to find out all charges billed to my health card number, and also the Endocrinologist' support to call them to take care of any error codes popping up.
Yeah I did, it just sucks that we have to deal with so much crap from healthcare in general. It got sorted but I‚Äôm so tired of it ya know
Oh I totally agree. I‚Äôm not trying to invalidate that at all. What I had in mind was like when I get blood work done, even if I‚Äôm dealing with the same person the entire process I have to confirm my legal name multiple times, which must be sucky as heck for people whose legal name is also their deadname. 

I also completely misread your original comment, and for whatever reason thought you were saying your deadname was ‚ÄòGerman‚Äô, not ‚Äòa name of German origin‚Äô. Which are two very different things!
Yeah I get regular blood tests, and the same person who just dealt with my paperwork at the desk will come back with me to draw my blood and  still go through me reconfirming name and birthdate. 

May I ask if your no preferred pronouns flair means you use all pronouns or would prefer no pronouns?
Oh okay, sorry. I was having a bad day yesterday and taking things people said the wrong way. 

But yeah i dont know which one she meant, it was extremely bizarre. She was a wild woman. She also called me a woman when talking about the effects of T and went on a ramble explaining why most doctors are afraid of anything to do with hormones bc they dont learn about it in school. It was a shitshow

Like my last name is literally of Germanic origin. My deadname is fucking french LOL. like if you wanted to talk about your german roots ma'am you didnt even have to deadname me... i have a silent D right there in my last name
Since I don't present 100% female as I just started on HRT, I let the person I deal with decide how they want to address me. I'm 58, and too old to get triggered for every small thing out there. Married to my HS sweetheart for 33years, two adult children 23F and 28M. I can never be 'mom' to them, and I don't want to. I waited till my responsibilities were complete, to start on HRT, with 100% support of my family. My family physician, Endocrinologist, and pharmacist are the best. My family physician did a change to the bloodwork requests identification panel, and now place where I get my bloodwork done don't even blink an eye when I present my provincial health card with my birthname. So yes, no preferred Pronouns, call me what you will. I'm on this journey now, for identity congruence, not to be bitch to everyone out there.

I'm not okay	"My foster mom got a call from her uncle today asking if they would want to buy her grandparents' house down in Indiana. They passed away about 2 years ago and her uncle has been taking care of the house up until now, but he can't keep paying the bills, so he has to sell it. Both my mom and dad have always wanted to move down there because they are not a fan of the state, we live in. They haven't decided as of yet.

I don't want to leave my sisters in other foster homes behind, I don't want to leave my state, it's my home, and I sure as hell don't want to live in a super conservative state. Since I'm in foster care I can refuse to go but I'd have to let go of the family that I've only had for 4 years. I'd have to go to a new foster home, and I'd end up aging out of the system since no one wants to adopt older foster kids, especially ones that are trans.

I want to beg them to stay but that house means so much to Mom, it's been in her family for 5 generations, moving there would be a dream come true for both my parents. How could I possibly take that away from them? I know if I move there that it's more than likely I'd get so depressed that I'd take my own life.

No matter what I chose I'll end up miserable. What the hell am I going to do?"	"Do yor parents know you're trans? If they do, I'd definitely talk with them about your concerns and how you feel.
>How could I possibly take that away from them?

You need to be honest with them as soon as possible. You can't make that decision for them. Plenty of people would value a child over some house. In their position they would want to be making the decision with all the facts before them. 

You want to beg then to stay so beg them to stay. You aren't taking about not wanting to move you said you thought moving would make you suicidal. If you don't you will regret it and if they leave you or if they take you and it makes things worse for you they will probably regret it as well.
Indiana resident here partner is transitioning and I understand not wanting to move here due to the conservative nature of the state but if your around Bloomington it can be a totally different experience. Just be open to the idea I feel there is always a safe place in every state just maybe not openly advertising it as much.
If they are good foster parents they would understand, but that‚Äôs really all the advice I can give, not being a foster kid myself so, say strong, if life has taught me one thing it‚Äôs that it all works out in the end!
They know I'm trans, but they don't like to talk about it unless it's to make fun of me. And if I were to bring it up, they would just tell me not to tell anyone if it's a problem or they would tell me I'm being too sensitive and that people in Indiana are ""so nice"".
Heyo! I'm from Indiana. This can definitely be touchy! In my opinion, South Bend, as well as towns near Indianapolis, especially Carmel, are actually very accepting. Pretty much everywhere else, people are *definitely not* ""so nice.""

If you want someone from Indiana to talk to, hit me up! My dms are open.
They are completely delusional.

No one believes me.	"I shared a video clip of that guy at CPAC calling for the ‚Äúeradication‚Äù of trans people on my Facebook account, and all I got two comments from right leaning family members claiming it wasn‚Äôt real and denying that republicans were passing laws threatening my life as a trans woman. No one else responded at all. 

I‚Äôm kinda blown away. I‚Äôve read a lot of these anti trans bills directly from the state legislatures, I‚Äôm not making this up, and yet people think I‚Äôm overreacting or they just flat out don‚Äôt believe me. Or they‚Äôre just completely silent, which I find somehow scarier."	"Literally after everything that is happening and they are still somehow just like ‚Äúnah, not true‚Äù
>Or they‚Äôre just completely silent, which I find somehow scarier.

Silence implies agreement. So hell yeah it's more scary.
Denial is also a stage of Genocide
I saw a YouTuber go over the '10 stages of a genocide' in regards to the trans legislation in the US and guess what?

9/10.

9/10 was currently happening in America. Only the 9th step wasn't currently happening. Fucking scary (and you don't need all 10 for it to be classified as a genocide)
I‚Äôm experiencing similar and it is truly frightening
ahh yes, the democrats totally faked an entire cpac event with actors playing well known republicans to make them look bad, that's totally how it works right? :V like...how can people say something like that isn't real? there's clear video evidence; contrary to popular belief that's not easy to fake.
Yeah, I‚Äôve been posting and sharing things on the fb and it‚Äôs fucking dead. I‚Äôve got like 10 things in a row with now shares/reactions. Granted, I‚Äôm no social media celebrity, but I‚Äôd expect 1 or 2, like with my other posts. Not a goose egg for 10 in a row. It‚Äôs sad
Ya, no that clearly doesn‚Äôt exist ‚Ä¶ and neither does racism‚Ä¶ and now if you are a ‚Äúgood person‚Äù quickly stick your fingers in your ears to avoid any contradictory information. üòë
Tennessee has one in the pipeline that will all but completely ban transgender care.  No one who receives government money will be allowed to provide trans care and another one that will make it a felony to provide the care to anyone 26 or under.  

Florida has one that if a child lives in Florida and they are trans, have a trans parent, or a trans sibling the state will take the child away even if the trans person lives out of state
Of course, they did the same thing when I came out.  Complete silence.  From everyone.  Not a single communication from a friend or family member in over two years.  It appears they all want me to disappear.
I know! I used both of those examples in my post and one of my relatives said it was utter bullshit.

Like, here's a freeking link to the state's legislative body with the actual text of the bill! I just don't understand this. Its like they just don't want to hear this, or believe it. They willfully want to avoid believing this.
I feel like they just don‚Äôt care because it doesn‚Äôt effect them"	11is4xp	trans	119	0.98	2023-03-05 08:45:13
Can you tell me which one isn't like the others? Apparently this bill is so loosely worded it could also impact trans folk and Pride.		"It's intended to effect trans people. Drag is just the excuse to make it look more reasonable to their hate fueled voterbase.
i've read it. you could be arrested for walking down the street humming along to a song you're listening to.
Oh my God, I can't wait till they basically define a drag show is just any kind of performance using makeup. Oh wait, isn't that what some other state already did?

How do you properly define a drag show anyway That isn't just different from a normal theatrical show for kids? This is because they think drag shows are inherently sexual.
Uh yeah, I live in TN and this bill is explicitly meant to target trans people or anyone who is gender non-conforming. They specifically cite drag performers in the bill as being ‚Äúmale or female impersonators,‚Äù which gives a lot of leeway for them to arrest anyone who they feel fits that mold. With how conservatives view trans people, they‚Äôll easily make that include them. 

This could also affect cis people who dress certain ways at pride events or elsewhere too, like if a cis gay man decided to wear booty shorts and a crop top in public. They might decide that that constitutes female impersonation, and then arrest them. 

THIS is why Knoxville Pride is now cancelling their event and reforming is as a protest and rally. Not only will drag queens not be able to perform as the highlight of their entertainment, nobody will be able to openly express themselves and celebrate this expression without potentially being arrested. The news just isn‚Äôt doing this justice overall and keeps downplaying it like it‚Äôll only affect drag queens. Nope, this is just another tactic that they‚Äôre using to try and outlaw the very existence of trans people and the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.
While the presentation of this bill to the media is to target ""drag"" - which is nebulously defined in it - it literally allows the police and any member of the public to target anyone who is viewed as not conforming strictly to a socially stereotyped visual gender.

All it requires is the other person to admit they viewed that person as being sexually provocative - and it requires law enforcement to arrest that person and the DA bring charges. As a felony sex crime.

Because of how vague the bill is - even Tennessee's own legal advisors called it unconstitutionally vague in committee - it can be used as carte blanche to arrest and charge anyone for any reason - essentially becoming a stop and frisk style bill.

Now - this probably won't change anything in the large cities. Knoxville, Chattanooga, Memphis metro and Nashville aren't like the rest of the state where these politicians come from - but it will drastically affect people like me if I dare to drive 20 miles outside those cities, in the smaller rural areas.
Who it impacts (and logic) isn‚Äôt important. It‚Äôs just ‚Äòchum‚Äô to keep the fascist bastards coming back for more.
And this is the state my parents want to move to.
This can't be constitutional.
Yet they right scream freedom and take away our rights,  the speed at which these bills are being proposed and passed is scary. I wish i had the means to move out of the United states but Im stuck like millions of other ppl to suffer here.
I wouldn't worry about it Tennessee is about to get hit with a whole lot of lawsuits and one of them will end this law before they can enforce it. It's just the goose steppers rattling their sabers trying to feel less impotent. We know the truth. They are afraid of anything that isn't white christian and subservient to that world. People being free?! Living their lives? oh my god Lulu Bell. Get thee to the bunker!
Shakespeare would have been arrested by these fools. Think about that.
I say wee can expect Canadas population to explode in the next few years
This is true. I live here. (MTF) It‚Äôs like a massive elephant in the room and nobody knows if we‚Äôre gonna be ok or not. It‚Äôs so loosely worded it could mean anything from minor inconvenience to a person hunt. And they know that.
It's strange to me that people are focusing on the 'drag' aspect of this bill and not on the children's healthcare aspect.

This bill will require currently transitioning minors to detransition next year. And it will prevent all minors from accessing even puberty blockers. This is the part of the bill that is less likely to get stuck down, and it will lead directly to children unaliving themselves.
Nothing wrong with people finding a hobby that‚Äôs fun for them and entertaining. If a drag performer is being perverted and creepy to a child it would have to be the person. Creepy people are everywhere
What is a drag show
Stupid laws that can be arbitrarily applied to anyone whenever it seems fitting are a fundamental part of any authoritarian state.
Everything to these people is inherently sexual.
How about we report any movie or such being recorded that includes a musical number.

Actors wear foundation to stop light reflections, so technically it's a performance using makeup
It‚Äôs way more than just some kind of bait to keep them coming back and engaged. If they wanted that, they‚Äôd keep paying this issue lip service and doing absolutely nothing legally to stop it. This is real, authoritative action to begin a genocide of trans people and the LGBTQ community as a whole. 

Who it impacts and the logic of it are VERY important here.
But in the meantime, we‚Äôll see people being arrested and jailed for living their lives honestly and openly. The lawmakers passing these bills know that they‚Äôre going to go to court, but they don‚Äôt care. They only want to do as much damage as they can before then.
even arms to Arkansas apparently
Well, we actually agree. was it Goering himself in the 1930s, that said facts weren‚Äôt important, but emotion was? I don‚Äôt think the USA Taliban has real genocide of us lgbtq folks as their goal. It‚Äôs just a way for the Fascists to angry their base, and eliminate democracy. The LGBTQ community has always been a very convenient scapegoat. Logically and objectively, we don‚Äôt present much of a threat to existing power structures, in any way. The Fascists don‚Äôt care about facts. They don‚Äôt care who gets hurt, as long as they get what they want. They have no good ideas on improving government or the lives of common people. Hatred motivates their base.
In my high school, they didn't like girls showing shoulders. Cause apparently guys would get too distracted. üôÑ
As an aside, the Fascists will even kill their own base to maintain rage, and attain power! Remember how irrationally ‚Äòanti mask, anti vaccine‚Äô the right wingers became, when it was ‚Äòprofitable‚Äô for them to do so? Covid death rates were WAY higher among Republican counties, than Dem ones. Yet every right wing Fox host and staffers were fully vaxxed!"	11b5omh	trans	118	0.98	2023-02-24 23:36:19
Texas bill would ban nearly all gender-affirming care, including for trans adults		"i wish everyone in texas who wants this passed would fall down several flights of stairs and not get up honestly

Fucking shit I live in texas
The Satanic Temple opened a religious based abortion clinic in Texas and New Mexico to give a kind of religious asylum to people refused care by the state law. Religious freedom is protected federally, and supersedes state laws. TST is also LGBTQIA2S+ friendly and would 100% do the same for gender affirming care if they found the funding to do so. Reach out to your local congregation!

Peace and love! Hang in there!

A new law was adopted in France about conversion therapy !	"Conversion therapy is now (it has been for a year, see edit 2) an infraction in France. Doctors who practice these kind of ¬´¬†therapies¬†¬ª would now face a 30000 euros fine and two years in prison (or 45000 euros and three years if the victim is a child).

So like are cis people just blind?	I‚Äôm starting to think this cause I was sitting down with my mom a supportive friend for dinner, and we started talking about Texas and the bills, and my mom starts talking about how ‚Äònobody really is anti trans‚Äô yet I‚Äôm literally getting harassed every time I go out and rarely online. Like Jesus I wish I could have this fantasy world they are in	"Same reason some white people believe racism doesn‚Äôt exist, or some men don‚Äôt believe misogyny exists. They don‚Äôt experience it firsthand and so a lot of it is just invisible to them, especially when it comes in the form of microaggressions and not explicitly hateful rhetoric.
no their genuinely very desensitized. literally had my mother who claims to be ‚Äúso super supportive‚Äù tell me not to come out to my sister cause it‚Äôll stress her.. and to make it even worse she justified my sister saying telling her kids about the LGBTQIA+ will corrupt them? when i said that‚Äôs homophobic she said ‚Äúshe‚Äôs just keeping her kids safe‚Äù??? LIKE WTF
they don‚Äôt see it until it happens to them. if they were trans they‚Äôd definitely see it.
My mother in law is the nicest woman on earth but holy shit she somehow didnt know transphobia existed until my father in laws mother literally disowned my fiancee because she's married to a trans woman.

And of course this literally happened because my mother in law outed me to some people who told my father in laws mom.

Also my fianc√©e's brother is literally transphobic. My mother in laws own son. And somehow she didn't know transphobia existed.

My fianc√©e's aunt also didn't know the rainbow flag was the pride flag. Honestly idk how people are so clueless about LGBTQ shit
""nobody is really anti trans""

""ok Nobody, thanks for letting me know""
Well my mom is supportive, she‚Äôs bought me my current wardrobe and drives me to my appointments with my hormone specialist, but it‚Äôs just crazy that she seems to over look the obvious hate I received because we live in a fairly right leaning town
That might be because of the bullshit coming from the right that lgbtq+ means groomer.
You know what was the funniest part, literally as she was saying that exact line one table down was some lady glaring at me in disgust as I had my mask that had my pronouns on it
my mom is kinda the same. she generalizes A LOT. but honestly maybe try telling her straight up the very obvious transphobia you‚Äôre experiencing? if that doesn‚Äôt work honestly i genuinely think no matter how ‚Äúsupportive‚Äù straight cis people are they‚Äôll never even try to see life through our eyes üò≠"	wyre80	trans	104	0.99	2022-08-27 02:39:07

My Opinion On The Florida Bill That's Not Talked About	"I will keep repeating this

They want us to trust the State of Florida to do the right thing when in the last five years we've had four politicians either arrested or investigating for doing stuff with a minor. And let's not forget letting Jeffrey Epstein run rampant.

Within the last year, just a couple of counties over they had multiple public school and private school teachers for CP, a couple of pediatricians for CP, it was either 2 or 3 police arrested for CP, a veterinarian for CP and ""sexual battery on a dog"".

Just recently they arrested a Hillsborough County high school basketball coach and a Tampa pastor for trying to hook up with underage girls.

And even though he's not from Florida let's not forget Larry Nassar.

And they expect us to trust the state to do the right thing?"	"Link to bill?  I probably don't want to read it, but I'm in a mood to feel bad tonight.
I‚Äôm really baffled at how anybody could have thought that bill is a good idea. It really shows that for them hurting trans people is more important than helping athletes
Effing terrifying.
I‚Äôm in North Carolina, and when I heard Florida had released a bill, I knew Florida had gone all ‚Äúhold my beer, y‚Äôall‚Äù. It‚Äôs like a point of pride with these a$$holes. I‚Äôm sorry to all of the kids who have to go through this.
HB-1475: the Matt Gaetz post-Congress employment act of 2021.
I know right
Everything you've just mentioned isn't just happening in Florida. Its a country wide, and worldwide, epidemic. That is what scares me. Florida won't be the only state to try and pass that bill
https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2021/1475/?Tab=BillText
Because once you get north of Orlando you're in the Deep South. Florida had to literally tell people: no you can't have sex with your pets, no you can't have sex with your livestock and no you can't have sex with wildlife... Hopefully that it starts to explain why so many people pedos get busted here and people with CP and a Trump supporting veterinarian sexually assaulting a dog.
Oh they've gone completely Fascist 101, a law got passed as well as several County ordinances. You can legally run over protesters, even if it's one person holding a sign you have to get a permit from the county and the county will decide if your protest is valid.
It's not just Florida, the bill is in 17 States throughout the South and Midwest not including the states where it has already passed.
Thanks!

Well, we can always hope they get swallowed by a sinkhole and eaten by alligators on the way to the vote.
How is that legal at a federal level? Doesn‚Äôt the right to protest override that law, or is it a case of ‚Äúyeah but good luck winning that case here.‚Äù
Yeah, that's exactly my point
Or like someone I know said: ""Wait until the snake venom's almost killed them before throwing them into molten bismuth and watching it crystallise around them.
It'll be ironic because it's rainbow colours""
Remember things they promise to drain the swamp, even the governor of Florida? They are turning the swamp into toxic sludge ""to protect the children""
The new acronym for the GOP is the Grand Order of Pedophiles
Read the post in my profile that I put in politics subreddit

In Florida if someone is blocking the roadway or whatever you can legally run them over and it is now illegal to desecrate a Confederate flag
The problem we're having in Florida is we have pedophilia running rampant in the open with very little being done about it. The veterinarian a county over with CP and sexually assaulting a dog and let me work this delicately ""possession of CP with a pre-adolescent involving an animal"" as the police reported it, people are down here saying it's CGI done by the Illuminati Jews. A pastor gets picked up for hooking up with underage children well that's okay that was the devil tempting him, politician trafficking high school girls or using fake IDs and burner credit cards to hook up with middle school girls well that's a deep State plot.

They are letting people walk with a slap on the wrist. And please let's not forget about Jeffrey Epstein here in Florida.

That's why I focus so much on Florida because Florida has the Sunshine Law and they have to post the information on sexual predators.

The Future is Bright	"The 2024 election is nearly 2 years away.

AND EVERY DAY UNTIL THEN A NEW GEN Z WILL TURN 18. 

Statistics show the vast majority of Gen Z is leaning left, while conservative beliefs are dying, and it has got republicans biting their nails.

We saved the midterm elections and canceled the so anticipated ‚Äúred wave.‚Äù 

We will do it again.

We are millions. 


Don‚Äôt get me wrong. I‚Äôm scared for what the next few years will be like. Too much misinformation going unchecked is being fed to people as we speak. And the bigots with offices at the capitol and a voice in congress are not backing down anytime soon. But they are on borrowed time. They know it. They want to introduce every anti-trans/anti LGBT bill while they can. They are using their hatred for us as a campaign strategy and it‚Äôs scary. And if trump, or even worse, desantis were to win the election, we‚Äôd be looking at some very dark years for all kinds of minorities in this country. Specially us. But again, as Gen Z grows, the future ahead is bright. 


I trust Millennials & Gen Z will take over the 2024 election. The racism, the homophobia, the transphobia, all the hatred towards anyone who isn‚Äôt white, cis, straight, and christian in this country isn‚Äôt being hidden by republicans anymore. Their extremism is pushing decent people left. Don‚Äôt get too discouraged by trump‚Äôs latest hateful speech, use it as motivation. We won in 2020, our support is growing, it‚Äôs likely we will do it again."	"I really really hope youre right.
I hope you're right... I really do.

But people keep talking themselves into it not being worth voting.... they did in 2000.  They did it in 2017.

I want to believe.
I really hope so, but I can‚Äôt afford too much hope. My state is really pounding the transphobia hard. Every day seems to get worse. But still, I hope
I agree with you but I want to say that winning elections isn‚Äôt going to do much to fix the damage that‚Äôs already been done. Even if our next president is a democrat I don‚Äôt see things changing much. Our current president is a democrat too and he‚Äôs doing nothing but quietly watching us suffer. We need to be out in the streets protesting and making our voices heard. If there is not a pre existing trans activist group near you then I urge you to start one. Go to local pride events and build a group of people willing to protest whenever they‚Äôre needed. That way whenever you need to protest you have a group of people behind you. You‚Äôre 100% right, we can change things for the better and I have hope in our future. But while voting is a great start, I don‚Äôt think it will do everything. We need to be loud and force them to hear our voices (in a non violent manner)
Don't jinx it
It only looks better if they vote. Overwhelmingly young people do not vote, if they did republicans wouldn‚Äôt have held hardly any offices going back 50 years let alone the past 20. This is how republicans keep office. There is a reason why they gerrymander and and suppress votes, it‚Äôs because they know if they didn‚Äôt they wouldn‚Äôt have held any offices for decades
I don‚Äôt hold this optimism, but I‚Äôm glad someone does. 

With voting rights under attack among many many other things simultaneously under attack - I feel these next elections will be stolen and there won‚Äôt be Jack shit we can do about it.
Now all y'all Millennials and Gen Zed gotta get out and vote.

Vote like our lives depend on it, because they probably will...
Honestly I know Zoomers get shit on a lot for being cringey but they are way better than my generation. Overall y'all are so much more open and accepting of other people and way more willing to callout the bullshit. Hopefully the combined might of Zoomers and Millennials will  finally be enough to put the boomer hegemony to rest.

I do hope this swan song of conservatism,  I was encouraged by mid-term results because it looks like all that investing in Transphobic culture war bullshit really didn't end up paying dividends for them in any meaningful way. I think most cishet voters just don't care about Trans people like that especially when it seems like everything is falling apart post pandemic but who knows something could happen before now and 2024 that sinks their chances further or boosts them up.

I also don't think DeSadist beats Trump in the primary, DeathSantis has like negative charisma and as soon as they debate I think Trump will pull his card and all the smaller candidates will also kind of take from away DeStupid. I do think he has a better shot at Biden but again Biden washes him because like Trump, Biden is way more likeable and once they start going into his record as governor, his politics and his less than reputable past I think voters will be turned off because again he has all the charm of a sea urchin being jammed in your taint.
Young people have been the fire for every social justice movement 

The Black Power movement? a 15 year old girl (Claudette Colvin) inspired the protest resulting in Rosa Parks arrest

I do think Gen Z is special, but every previous generation hopes the new generation will turn the tide. We cant forget about those whove been working for liberation for decades, or put all the work onto Gen Z

EDIT our community is tough as hell and we will persevere like we always have, but we will need every generation to join the fight

Things weren‚Äôt this horrible in 2016/2017. Trust.
Presidential elections usually get a lot more people voting than anything else, and if the last midterm was anything to go by then we have reason to hope.
Republicans are sure preparing to suppress votes. But Democrats are preparing to not let that happen. We have wonderful people fighting for our rights in congress, AOC currently taking the lead on that as her influence on the media grows!
Do you think Biden will run again? I personally don‚Äôt think so. He‚Äôs too old. I do see Kamala running for president, she‚Äôs already doing a good job as vice president. I can see her becoming the first woman to be president of the US.
I genuinely think it can be if we try. I know things are very bad right now and honestly I think it‚Äôs going to get a lot worse. But we do have the power to be loud and fight for our rights. If we just give up then they‚Äôre definitely going to win. But if we fight, at least we have a chance
So what you‚Äôre trying to say is that democrats are the true fascists trying to commit genocide because people in cities sometimes do hate crimes?

What?
What are you saying? I‚Äôm legitimately not clear what you‚Äôre even arguing.
No, not really. We have people fighting for us. Groups like the ACLU. But we don‚Äôt have support in congress or the federal government. We don‚Äôt. 

I seriously doubt democrats will have a spine for this either. 100+ voted to ‚Äúcondemn‚Äù socialism. Whatever their term ‚Äúsocialism‚Äù means currently. 

Democrats aren‚Äôt out saviors. They‚Äôre just the best we have.
I don't think anybody in Biden's cabinet would have a shot tbh. I think Gretchen Whitmer from Michigan would be a really good candidate if Biden doesn't run, she at least seems like an establishment Dem who isn't afraid to stand up to the right, I think her government's response to her kidnapping plot was way better than Biden's was to Jan 6. Gavin Newsom from Cali might also be good but he has some baggage.

As a leftist my dream would be for Daddy Bernie to run again and win. I hope he does run at the very least to push the other candidates left but he is as old as Biden so I'm not sure how voters would respond. He might run the 3rd time and people be like ""We've tried everybody else at this point"" and win off that and all the Gen Z voters coming in for 2024. But that is a bit fantastical I admit.
[removed]
The #1 thing we need to focus on is voting. Getting people to vote. Fighting/blocking voter suppression. Forget everything else. Voting. That‚Äôs it.
AOC would be my dream. She leads with LOVE and education. I just read a presidential candidate needs to be 35, she‚Äôs 33 right now so in two years she‚Äôd be perfect.
Wow. Okay. How do you feel about your party actively trying to destroy the rights of trans people?
You‚Äôre a silly goose.
I think it has to do with as people age and accumulate wealth they are more likely to be conservative bc of the conservative talking points about those brown people who wanna take all your hard earned dollars away

How long did it take you to come out after realizing you were trans?	I (ftm) started questioning my gender a little under a month ago and I‚Äôve mostly accepted that I‚Äôm probably trans but sometimes I still have doubts. On the one hand, I feel like dysphoria describes a lot of what I‚Äôve been feeling my whole life, especially social dysphoria, but on the other hand I feel like maybe I haven‚Äôt thought about it long enough and I can‚Äôt know yet. I see a lot of people thought about it for months before coming out to anyone so I feel like I need to spend more time waiting and seeing how I feel even though the majority of the time I‚Äôm pretty certain I‚Äôm trans. Even though it‚Äôs only been about a month I‚Äôve been thinking about it all day every day during that time. I know it‚Äôs probably just self doubt talking but I‚Äôm still curious if anyone else took the ‚Äúfast track‚Äù so to speak. I want to come out to my parents, I know my mom would probably be accepting (she‚Äôs been absolutely livid about the anti-trans bills in Texas and Idaho) but I just feel like maybe it‚Äôs ‚Äòtoo soon‚Äô or something :/	"I'm m to f. December 8, 21 in therapy my egg cracked. Right after my appointment I went and bought feminine underwear. I got socks too and a small bra nothing too noticible immediately. Euphoria and felt so right for me. So I got skinny jeans and tight t shirts and presented androgynous/femme. Started coming out to people in person as I saw them through December - Jan. Early Feb I started on social media. Late Feb I made it visible to friends. I was presenting feminine in public from late Jan, in dresses skirts etc. So basically from the moment I accepted and realized I started from day 1 but if you count dressing/presenting full time 1 month. I'm also on estrogen started 1.5 months ago.
24 gods damned years...
I‚Äôm still not out to my family, but determined to be out by the end of the month. I realized‚Ä¶ around 16 days ago, as of March 8th.

Why the end of the month? It‚Äôs International Transgender Day of Visibility!

That was a lot more than I thought it would be when I started!
Well, I realized I was trans at 14. Came out to my SO at 15 and nobody else until 17, when I told my internet friends.

IRL I came out at 20. I'm 22 now, over a year on HRT and name change and most of my extended family doesn't know yet. That's because my immediate family is not supportive and still ignores I ever came out even tho I have a beard but oh well.
I told some friends I was questioning a year or two into it. I came out to family and other friends about 5 years after that. I kept saying ""I'll do it when I turn 18.. 20..21...""
I've been feeling the same way. I also seem to be on ""the fast track"" and want to come out but I've also been feeling a little doubt that maybe it hasn't been long enough
it took 4-5yrs for me to come out to one person but im still not properly out they think im just a lesbian
I started to question at age 12, I realized I was trans at age 15, and I'm currently 23 and not out to anyone.... (my parents know but I have not done anything thing else....) The only thing currently keeping me alive is the promise I made my mother, shortly after her father died, not to kill myself. I can't put her through this type of misery deliberately. It would be disrespectful and selfish. So instead I'm rotting from the inside...
My advice: Don't keep it in! It will only hurt you in the most horrible ways.
It's difficult for me to pin down the exact time I realized I was trans. I remember telling a friend ""I think I would describe myself as trans in a month or so"", so maybe I had realized it, but I just needed more time for it to sink in?

Anyway, I came out to my parents about a month or two after I accepted I was trans. I came out to them at that time because I was home at the time for the summer (I study at a university away from my hometown). I wanted to come out to them so I could hopefully have their support and start transitioning medically.
About a year for most people. Still waiting on coming out to my dad
i don‚Äôt actually remember a ‚Äòcoming out‚Äô, it was more so just figured out ig?
From when I was 90% sure I was trans to me coming out was probably a month which was mostly spent building up confidence to come out to my mom and gf at the time and also thinking of a few names I like
(Edit: I knew I was different when I was growing up and more ‚Äúsensitive‚Äù but most ppl just assumed I was gay and then after I started therapy at 16 and dealt with some internal trauma I found out the cause of some or most of my depression and uncomfortability :)

TL:DR therapy helped me realize I‚Äôm trans ‚Äòlater‚Äô in life.
About 7 years‚Ä¶
i questioned my gender at 14/15 and came to the conclusion i‚Äòm not trans because i thought nonbinary people are ""trenders"" and i wasn‚Äòt a trans man (yes i was very stuck in kalvin garrah phase which was ew). then started questioning again at 17 and figured out i‚Äòm nonbinary. came out to all my online friends like a few months after. i came out to my best friend irl circa 8 months after figuring it out, but i‚Äòm mostly still in the closet. i tried being open about it in college but everyone here misgenders me so idk if they count.  i‚Äòm 19 now 

i think everyone just has to take this while thing at their own pace. if you feel comfortable identifying as trans and you wanna tell people you should go for it. good luck i hope it all goes well!<3

also sorry this turned into such a long text
I (Mtf) took about a week after my first realization to finally admit to best friend (FtM) that i am trans. He immediately hugged me and told me that after living with me for a year and a half he already had suspicions and was glad I was comfortable to tell him.
you definitely don‚Äôt have to wait! it‚Äôs a very personal decision and you shouldn‚Äôt feel pressured by what other people do. that being said, bc i know we all worry about being ‚Äònormal,‚Äô i came out i wanna say three days after i figured it out? it‚Äôs been a while and i had a lot of things going on at the time mental health/personal life wise so i don‚Äôt remember exactly but i know it was definitely less than a week. as soon as i knew, i knew and while i didn‚Äôt come out to my mom then, i did come out to my best friends, and then our like wider friend circle within the month.
I came out on the day I started questioning and social transitioned 18 days later. Trans any% speedrun, y'all are slow get on my level.
Define ‚Äúcoming out.‚Äù For me, I told some close friends and such almost immediately, but it‚Äôs been almost 2 years and I‚Äôm only just now about to tell most of my immediate family, so it‚Äôs different time tables for different people. Some people you‚Äôre close with and are supportive you can come out to really fast and they‚Äôll be there for you through your journey of discovery even if your identity changes more!
My fiance and friends knew before I did lol. I told my brothers pretty soon after I figured it out, maybe a month because I only see them like four times a year. I told my parents after 3 months, and then they told grandparents and aunts and uncles over the following 4 months or so. I usually come out to people pretty soon after I meet them. I live in a very accepting city, so I don't feel compelled to keep it a secret.
Yeah I'm in a similar boat. It was about a month and half ago and I've come out to 5 people already. They are all reasonably knowledgeable and one almost made me cry when I found out he'd been definitely looking at the trans side of reddit after I told him I was questioning. 

I told them pretty much what you describe here, that I'm 90% confident I'm trans, but I still have doubts. One of those people was my friends mom who has been like a second mother to me. Everyone's reaction has been positive so I have to say I'm pretty lucky. If your mom is upset about the anti trans nonsense going on in this country right now, you'll probably feel a lot better if you come out to her. Let her know you have doubts, but that you've been questioning for a while. It sounds like she'll be supportive. Good luck dude
!All passages that are marked spoilers have transphobia in them!

FTM I didnt quite realize for around 3 years. (despite the obvious signs. I knew but didnt really want to accept it) 

I told my best friend, around a month (?) after fully accepting that i was, in fact, trans. Bless their heart, they were amazing and tried their best, as well as asking if they should inform their then-boyfriend and supportive (kinda its complicated) family. 

>!I never told my extended family. They were the transphobic ""im not on the left or right im in the middle teehee"" ""Its my beliefs you should have an OPEN MIND you bigot"" type.!<

my grandma, on the other hand, is probably the most amazing person ive ever met. she has told me on multiple occasions that she would love me unconditionally, and ive always felt comfortable to come out to her... >!except that im unsure as to whether shed inform my family, it would then get messy, so that day has not yet come. !<

it entirely depends on how safe you feel to come out. just remember that there will ALWAYS be atleast ONE person who supports you. whether thats now, or in the future. however, if you dont feel safe, then comming out should probably wait until your sure and ready.
I realised i wasn't cis 6 years ago or so but realised it was too scary at the time and I wasn't sure of a label so I forced myself back into the closet.  I was like 14. I'm 20 now and out mostly in public and with friends but in the closet with family
Idk I'm non-binary and I started questioning in August 2020 so coming up two years and I havent come out yet soo yeaüëå
Over 7 years
Depending on how you define realizing and coming out, between four and seven years.
28 years, although I'm only out to my wife and kids, still 'in' to everyone else.
I think I realized it at 20 but tried to keep everyone happy by saying ‚ÄúI‚Äôm genderqueer and it literally doesn‚Äôt change anything‚Äù. When I was 25, I admitted it at pride and came home and told my parents, but waited another year to start HRT to try to ease them into it. Fast forward another 7+ years and they still aren‚Äôt consistently using the right name and pronouns, so I probably should‚Äôve just gotten on with it at 20.
Oh mood, I've (ftm) only accepted myself for a week or two and I'm already impatient about coming out to my whole family, classmates, friends, online, to administrators, my bosses, etc. etc. Only problem is that every time I try I start shaking like a leaf! I managed to squeak it out to my mom and she half shut me down, half supported me (it sucked) but even though I'm shaky and sad and scared again after that, all I want to do is come out to my dad, and my grandparents, and my professors, and everyone on the street, and.... üòÇ

Like I'm so insecure that even a halfhearted response is enough to make me doubt, but I think it means something that despite all the deep fears I can't stop thinking about it. This has got to be some common thing, right?
More than ten years and I really wish I had done something about it as soon as I knew
There is no right time, just your time

I started questioning gender has 2 years or more (depends about what counts), but my egg cracked recently. Less than a week later I came out to my boss... fortunatelly everything went fine cause I remember his son and he was caught by the thought that one day could be they


I didnt start exploring clothes because I have a very phobic father but my mom is aware of my femme prediletion in presentation since I was able to talk so... it is blur here
I told a couple of people while questioning/instantly, all close family within 1 month, everywhere including work within 1 year. There‚Äôs no limits and you don‚Äôt have to do it all in one go, plus if you realise you picked the wrong label or pronouns or even name you can always change it, especially if you are early days and tell them you are still questioning
I had been questioning my gender since i was like 6, but i didnt accept that i was until about 18, and i didnt realize i was trans until about a few months ago the moment I realized that I started coming out to people around me a few weeks later. Now I turn 20 in about a month and I'm on Day 2 of HRT, and my life has never felt more aligned than it does right now
I knew something was up ever since I could remember, but never had the terminology for it until I was in my 30s but I just came out a year ago and I‚Äôm about to be 44.
Socially, to my close friends, took maybe two weeks. Mostly because I was unsure how some would react but since two of said friends were trans too and had already come out I figured it was okay.

Took longer to come out to my family, still an incomplete process.

And so far not out to work.

It's been 18 months since I had my realization.
mtf here. I realized i was different at 19 but didn't really know about transgender people then, plus i grew up in a mega chaotic house, so being anything other then straight was a sin. it wasn't until 25 that i really realized that i was trans, but at that point i thought it was too late to transition. i buried my feelings for another 5 years. in that time, i became super depressed and, in the end, suicidal. Luckily i made the choice to step out of the closet and transition. 3 years later and i can honestly say it was the best decision i ever made.
That‚Äôs a tricky question because I never know how to answer when I knew I was trans.  July 2019 was the first time I really accepted I probably wasn‚Äôt cis (was only vaguely familiar with the term) in a way I couldn‚Äôt rationalize it away like alway had done before.  In November I finally started exploring trans Reddit and realized I definitely wasn‚Äôt cis, but thought I could continue presenting male.  January 2020 was when I knew I was definitely a trans woman.   The first person I told was my brother in late February because the stars had lined up, we were at a brew fest and I was certain he was blackout drunk (turned out he wasn‚Äôt, but it worked out for the best that way).  I told my parents that March after a very successful first therapy session.  Then in May I came out to my best friends over discord after realizing I could stop waiting to tell them in person because Covid was staying.  After that I slowly worked my way through other friends, extended family, and finally my coworkers until I officially socially transitioned in August 2021.  Especially for the first few I told I thought had gone a little too fast, but I kind of knew it was the right time to tell them.  So don‚Äôt worry, I know you will find a good time to tell your parents üòä.
I feel like I knew when I was like 13. I finally accepted it when I was 21
Kind of before I knew.
I came out to my mom and sister as I don't know what I am but I have dysphoria and I do not think I am a girl and 2 weeks later I settled on non-binary and left it to discect it later(which has not come yet) 
I came out later that month to my father (he is against effeminate men but I don't know how to explain that that's also low-key homophobic but fully supports me) and my brother who lives on his own when he came to visit
I knew I was in the wrong body at 6 but didn‚Äôt know what trans was at that time. I‚Äôm 29 now and just came out as trans 2 months ago, the day I accepted it with myself I told my whole family and I‚Äôm already 1 month+ on hormones and set to have surgery in May. Things can move fast once you are sure but if you are unsure that is also okay and move things along are your own speed. Good luck, your mom sounds like a good one so that is at least a relief üíôüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è
Wow, that‚Äôs definitely pretty fast! Makes me feel better about how fast I seem to be going compared to a lot of other people üòÖ
Well that seems like a pretty good plan B)
Happy cake day
Thanks for the advice, I hope you‚Äôre able to come out sometime in the near future if it‚Äôs safe to do so
Thanks, this gives me some confidence haha. I‚Äôve talked to a couple of friends about it already and they‚Äôre super supportive. I‚Äôll probably come out to my mom soon since I‚Äôm honestly pretty terrible at keeping secrets, but I‚Äôm not sure how I want to do it. I came out to my best friend with a meme üíÄ
Thanks :) I feel pretty safe with coming out to my mom and I‚Äôve come out to my best friend already and he was supportive, so I‚Äôm lucky in that regard. I‚Äôm mostly confident that I‚Äôm trans (it would honestly probably make less sense if I was cis) but I think I might wait a bit to come out since my family has got a lot going on right now and I‚Äôd like to be a little more certain, I think
Yeah, I‚Äôm afraid if I talk to my parents about it in person I might not get a word out haha so I‚Äôm considering maybe giving my mom a letter or something
Each transition is different to each person. I'm going fast and I know it. Feels right to me. Nothing wrong with taking it slow and gentle either. Gotta do what's right for you üòâ
Oh wow thanks, I didn't even know it was approaching. Lol
its good you have peopel who support you. take your time, and come out when your ready. have a good day bro.
Thanks, you too man B)"	t9zm2a	trans	88	0.96	2022-03-09 04:30:37
Why, why are there so many anti trans bills being passed?	"What is the point? Why do they hate us so fucking much? Why not just accept us? What is wrong with them? Why would they purposely end someone‚Äôs life over _one_ difference? _one_. There is only one difference in someone and they kill us? The fuck, what is their problem? 

Sure, they think people shouldn‚Äôt play along in our ‚Äúgame‚Äù..but if it‚Äôs enough to save a HUMAN life..shouldn‚Äôt they just accept us‚Ä¶"	"It's as simple as:

Conservative views are unpopular. An easy way to rally people to an unpopular cause is to use a group of people as a scapegoat for the world's problems. Trans people are a minority that aren't possible to get rid of, that already had a negative stigma.

Basically, we were at the wrong place at the wrong time to be weaponized by nazis and neo-cons.
Manufactured culture war to distract everyone from the real problems (poverty, war, starvation) Trans people are easy scapegoats because we are already seen as ""weirdos"" and not many cis people know trans people irl so it's easy for the media to lie about who we are
To add to the spot-on comments already here, the Conservatives have lost the culture war on gay people.  More people on both sides are accepting of same-sex relationships, but they can still call on their base to misunderstand gender identity and be confidently incorrect on their 1960‚Äôs-era understanding holding up in 2023.  Publicly hating African-American people or Jewish people is also out these days, but few moderates will stick their necks out for trans people.  Some on the Left will still even parrot the ‚ÄúI‚Äôm worried about the children doing something irreversible to their bodies‚Äù to justify their tepid support.

Two quick quotes I heard recently that I think help put current events on the Right in perspective: ‚Äúbook banning isn‚Äôt about fear of books, it‚Äôs fear of knowledge‚Äù and ‚Äúmen fear being seen as feminine because they fear being treated like they treat women.‚Äù  Misogyny and Ignorance are their battle standards.
It's being pushed by a collective of hard-right christofascist PACs, funded by billionaires, with the implied goal of dismantling queer rights.
Their ""platform"" is hollow and empty. The GQP has literally nothing on offer except fear and outrage. They can no longer (safely) target ethic minorities, so trans people are a safe and politically isolated minority with few real allies.
We‚Äôre the easiest target.  They have to back off POC hate, bc there‚Äôs an election coming and they need the ‚Äòblack and brown vote‚Äô.  We‚Äôre a small group who lacks major money, star power, big voices.
Cause they can. Cause their base thrives of cruelty. Cause Republicans hate people who stand out in anyway shape or form and want them to suffer. Cause conservatism is evil. Cause they always have to have a target as a distraction, and they lost the same sex marriage fight (for now).

Fuck conservatives. You stay safe and stay alive. They win when we all die. ‚úäÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏èüè≥Ô∏è‚Äçüåàü´Ç
It triggers voters so it is a planned strategy. Thus, so many states copying. Notice it is coming from one party. The outrage is manufactured.
We are pawns in the bigger political game of the GOP, making life unbearable in red states for liberals. We are an easy boogeyman to attack and vilify. It is all about power and keeping red states red and purple states from turning blue.
Giving the people someone to hate means more votes for them. If only people voted based off of facts and not horrific misinformation
Because their voters are hateful and bigoted and since they don't have anything offer and want to keep political control they need a new boogie man. So, we meet so many requirements, we are a very small minority, they don't understand us, they have dehumanized enough over the years. So they just distract their voters by giving them this new group to hate while they keep/gain control, distract them from all the awful things they do and carry the agenda of their billionaires donors. 
That's all, is not about facts, is not about protecting anyone, it's not about principles or anything that would make sense. Just power and $.
To the evangelical Christians and neo nazis/fascists it‚Äôs either the end of the world or just their chance at regaining power. It‚Äôs both. Fascists are utilizing Christianity as a shield and it‚Äôs all a divide and conquer tactic. Go after one then the next until there‚Äôs no one they hate except themselves left.
Because they are losing.

Because we‚Äôre in the stages of genocide [https://img.ifunny.co/images/a49e44a815069be4d3ad95ed9fde0f9f7be784cea70917a6b3f2e7f8a933b835_1.jpg](https://img.ifunny.co/images/a49e44a815069be4d3ad95ed9fde0f9f7be784cea70917a6b3f2e7f8a933b835_1.jpg)
I saw one where it‚Äôs now very hard to get treatment for breast cancer. Now that‚Äôs gonna be a problem for cis women and men (can they get? Idk) they are shooting themselves in the foot with that one
What I've noticed from experience is that the conservative views and politicians are really bad and been destroying the United States since sliced bread by rallying mislead public and people with mild views or who have no opinion/understanding/education on the matter, and the way they'd do is apparently finding a scheme or a motto that would work well to hook the public and make them vote for their evil system, since if you basically strip republicans and a lot of democrats of their TV agenda, neither party does really much to address the actual problems the country has been facing for decades, on top of still pleasing the richy rich.

The only difference so far is that one major party tries to focus on the things that are realistic to achieve without starting a culture war or taking away things from people for no damn reason, and the other party(GOP that is), their whole selling point is to come up with a new strategy to get all the attention and enough hate to sway everybody psychologically to their side so they can get ""things"" done, when in fact, they've been destroying the quality of life for decades because of their unpopular views/beliefs/extremism, lack of education/understanding and simple BIGOTRY.

If you took away their TV time and educated everybody on the matter, they'd literally have nothing to do in the office because the majority doesn't want somebody doing insane shit. So they have to focus on something else that the public wouldn't ""potentially"" hate too much and weaponize everybody against that.

Honestly, they seem like the kind of ill, insecure people that just don't care and will do whatever just to hold any power and money over somebody else.

Basically, trans rights, is another agenda like gay rights a decade ago, Iraq, 9/11 wars in 2000s, or some other junk from way before then to keep the rich looting the country while they get to do whatever they want while they're in office and keep public's eye on made-up ""issues"" to avoid taking responsibility for all the things that affect EVERYBODY in the damn country.

Kids never had anything to do with it, it's just a perfect scapegoat to get the most attention from an average person. They never cared about the kids, it's just an excuse to succeed in their legislation and laws. It's the old trick they've been using for probably at least 100 years by now.

We just happen to fall victim to their current agenda in order to take over. I don't think anybody really cares naturally, and most people would definitely say that their GENUINE problem is bills, expensive housing/rent, and a lot of other issues like meds and employment that's been neglected for so long because nobody has the balls to address the issues to fight off the actual problems.

I rambled a lot, but TLDR is that they most likely don't care, but they need to use transgender people to win the election to keep the rich in power and occupy the public with made-up issues to last the office.

thanks.
They just don‚Äôt want people to be happy. Because the happier people are the less crime there is and there is less separation from people in this beautiful world.
The goal is to make an ""other"" so it easy to target a social group to build power and enrage there base
Basically because with in the next 3 election cycles these folks won't be in power anymore. 

This is a rabid attempt to leave a legacy that will be struggled against for the next 15 years. 

They know the base they have formed has such major cracks and flaws they have to act now or there hatred will never get to made into law. 

Younger cons seem to be the more reasonable between them and say the x's and before. 

Many folks of gen y and z have had experience around folks who are lgbtqia+ of some degree we got the chance to be humanised by our peers on the other side of the isle. That's the fear the current gop caucus has. Because they know a correction is coming.. Partly because there media made an entire generation the outgroup. Heck they are working on making gen z part of that out group as well. 

I believe it was last election cycle that gen y became the demographic with the most voting power. So once gen y and z start running more well start to see that shift more and more.
\^\^\^ Came here to say this.
I would only add that to a party struggling with an identity and addicted to identity politics, a vulnerable minority without significant support is the best one to attack. To put it bluntly, trans ppl ourselves are not the problem. We are, as replied above, the scapegoat. It's as simple as a weakened republican party looking to rally its numbers and voters by offering up something to believe in; and that something is hatred and oppression of trans people.
Protect yourselves. It‚Äôs not going to get better anytime soon.
""conservative views are unpopular"" yeah, that's why they're passing so effectively, totally unpopular... They're not unpopular, that's the fucking issue
To also add there is another reason they do distraction pick a enemy someone dif use them have ppl focus pure rage and hatred bc ppl never think when they are angry watch what they do when they are in full swing Bill's that give their corp doners trillions why does the gop exist profit the rest collateral damage
>and not many cis people know trans people irl

This is the answer. It's so easy to spread misinformation and fear when most people don't have a counter example in their own life.
\^\^\^ This! Right down the line!
10 Stages of Genocide

1Classification
People are divided into ""us and them.""

(2) Symbolization
People are forced to identify themselves.

3) Discrimination
People begin to face systemic discrimination.

4 Dehumanization
People equated with animals, vermin, or diseases.

5 Organization
The government creates specific groups (police or
military) to enforce the policies.

6 Polarization
The government broadcasts propaganda to turn the
populace against the group.

7 Preparation
Official action to remove and relocate people.

8 Persecution
Beginning of murders, theft of property, trial massacres.

(9) Extermination Wholesale elimination of the group. It is extermination
and not murder because these people are not
considered human.

10 Denial The government denies that it has committed any crime.
Yup, pretty much this.
Well, they do have some popular support, but it is not universal. Please hear me out.

Because the GQP has near total control over numerous statehouses, despite the general disposition of the populations at large and the fact that these governments live in echo chambers that rarely reflect the will of the people at large, they think the populace will back them no matter what. Most of their voters are largely ignorant (I can only hope) rather than genuinely hostile - though there are genuinely hostile people out there, ngl. Because trans people are a very small percentage of the population, the chances of knowingly meeting one of us, let alone knowing one of us personally, is slim, so the reactionary right can say whatever bullshit they want and no one will really be the wiser. This, I think, is why so many anti-trans bills are being passed, to keep the population from actually getting to know us as human beings, rather than as abstractions to be ""debated"".
The views aren't popular, the people are. They use populist rhetoricand say things that people think they want to hear, rally behind a perceived public threat, and then justify it with sophistry. People don't like the idea of genocide, but they do like keeping children safe from predators. Er go, Republicans call trans people predators, and they get votes.
Three states, and part of a fourth...out of 50 have banned trans healthcare for people under 18.  It's mostly the South, which isn't surprising at all.  However, that being said, some Southern states are outright vetoing the bans.

I think we should give people the benefit of the doubt and I honestly believe that most people are too worried about themselves to be worried about what other people are doing.
The anti gay and trans Bill's further another cause as well trans ppl are starting to arm themselves as poc did back in the day when they were the main target the are trying  to turn be dif into a medical mental health  issue to push legislation  to correct the evil bastards meaning that you are are un armed when they come

I‚Äôm exhausted from the hate	"I‚Äôm a trans female that works as a massage therapist. I really enjoy my work. And I can honestly say this is the first job I‚Äôve ever had where I want to go to work. Sometimes, I feel like being trans is a super power in my job. Many people are relieved when they see that I‚Äôm a trans person. Often, I can see their body relax when the subject gets brought up. Those experiences totally make my day. But those experiences are rare. Much more frequently, I have clients express transphobic and hurtful feelings. Sometimes, a client will cancel their appointment all together, saying they prefer a ‚Äúfemale‚Äù therapist. The last time this happened, a husband interrupted his wife‚Äôs session to tell her that he didn‚Äôt approve of her therapist. Sometimes, the comments come from fellow therapists. It‚Äôs all just so tiring. I feel depression creeping in for the first time since I started HRT. 

I‚Äôm also a Florida resident. And my state just passed a pretty nasty (and very transphobic) bill through legislation.

I'm so sorry that this is happening sweetie. For this kind of thing to happen, the bill and the way youre treated, is just wrong. But you're strong sweetie. Keep your head up. Always know you're not alone.
This is why I'm afraid to fully come out in public... This kind of shit scares me to death. I am not half as brave as the people I see out there being their best selves ;(.
I'm sorry u have to deal with that but I'm so proud of u for trying to live your best life and being a positive respective for trans people
AMAB, and also a Florida resident. This state is a damn wasteland outside of a few oases, one that has done the impossible: made me miss living in New Jersey. The people who pushed for that law are also the same douchebags who hailed Matt Gaetz as a future rising star for the GOP and are probably insisting now that he's been framed, and besides, it's actually ephebophilia, amirite?

I keep seeing things like that bill passed in the states and it genuinely makes me angry!

Florida House Passes Bill Banning Transgender Women Student-Athletes and Allowing for ‚ÄòGenital Inspections‚Äô		"""we're not targeting the trans community"" what a load of crap.

Minors in highschool will have to expose themselves so they can play sports on female only teams, this is not going to end well.
Welp, can this be called abuse and pedophilia since they seem to want to know and see the genitals of minors?
‚ÄúQuick we have to check your genitals‚Äù ‚Äúwhy?‚Äù ‚ÄúTo protect privacy‚Äù
Also is this bill even necessary? Is trans kids at schools a problem to sports? I want to see proofs, are trans children overthrowing every female teams in the us? Come-on
This is not only screwed up it degrading. How can they actually think this is okay?
And this disgusting human being has the audacity to say ""we are doing it based on science""

I wonder, is there any studies about the performance of male and female kids and teens in sports? I imagine the difference would be smaller than in adults, i remember in my days of school some girls were mad good at some sports
What the fuck is wrong with people?
Imbeciles. They‚Äôll regret that
Imbeciles. This will come back to haunt them.
this is disgusting
I hate this timeline
I saw this today and I think it‚Äôs disgusting. Why is this even necessary in the first place?
This is genuinely dystopian... Not to mention abhorrent...

Isn't half of the rhetoric against trans women that it's supposed to somehow allow sexual predators to get closer to children? Meanwhile, this explicitly enables adults to inspect the genitalia of minors...

I've been in this War for 50yrs and I see this as going perfectly. In the 90's I was working with the CLCC in Minneapolis. We sent a delegation to DC every year to lobby for Transsexual Rights (that's what we called ourselves back then). At first they wouldn't even talk to us. After a few years, they began to laugh at us. Now we have them right where we want them, acting like fools and fighting tooth and nail against us. I never heard a story about trans people on FOX Noise in the 90's. Now they've done over 40 hit pieces on us in 3mos. I think we have their undivided attention. We are all over the front page of the News and Politics subs. I never saw that before either. Victory is near.

All this abuse is doing is eroding their moderate vote. A lot of people are going to see this as nothing but child abuse of a innocent minority. These children have harmed no one, and they know it. They are already abandoning the Republican Party in droves. The People are fed up with their bullying and criminal antics. 

They don't know how to play the long game and that's what we've been playing. The pendulum is swinging hard in our favor. 2 to 1 the population is now totally against all this anti-trans legislation. Caesar has lost control of the masses. Evil is being chased back into the shadows where it belongs. In 18mos it will all come back to bite them in the ass. We have won the People. To all my peeps that have educated the masses, you did this, this is your victory. Take it. 

It's just a matter of time and not much of that now and it will all change. Expect extreme resistance in the final years just like the Battle of Berlin. And like that battle, their resistance is crumbling with troops abandoning them and no reinforcements available. Keep up the pressure. Keep making allies. Our friends will win this War for us. Remember that and thank them. Love conquers all. 

Now to fight this recent abuse on the grassroots level the coaches and athletes need to go on the attack. The coaches need to challenge a full inspection of the gender of every athlete at every athletic event. The students won't put up with this and shouldn't. They should flip the bird and walk off the field in solidarity. The parents will be furious that their child is being molested by Republican perverts and probably even more furious that there was no game. Win, win. It is quite possible for Students and Coaches to shut this down if they choose to.
Quick, come here underage student, drop your pants now. ‚ÄúWhat why?‚Äù To prevent pedophilia
Genital inspections is just sick. And these are the ones always accusing us of be pedophiles
Fuck these asshats people are people shouldn‚Äôt matter why we identify as
Like wtf
It definitely isn't necessary. The number of the trans population is already miniscule. The population of trans athletes is even smaller. Trans people are the GOP's new favorite target.
Trans children perform worse on average than their cis counterparts.
Trans athletes typically perform worse than their cis counterparts. (According to Scientific American- A reputable respected source)

Although it does say, that may be specific to the sport.


On top of that the actual differences could be so miniscule that minor advantages/disadvantages become a problem within cis groups too (like testosterone levels etc)
Any studies about that? That would be greatly usefully in discutions about this topic

Trans in Sports: The Revenge	"Some States are passing transphobic bills to keep trans girls away from girls teams in schools. These trans girls are not in the Olympics. They are just having fun and socializing. These bills kill. They increase the suicide rates in a group with extremely high suicide rates. 

Under these bills, a student‚Äôs gender would be determined by the ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù indicated on the student‚Äôs original birth certificate issued at the time of birth.

To fight this shameful acts of hate, there is a LGBTQI+ group that can help: trans boys. Under these bills they are considered girls (by ‚Äúbiological sex‚Äù), so they need to join girl teams. Even if they are not good at it. Just as an act of protest to help our trans sisters. If they do not let trans boys be part of the girls teams, they could sue them for discrimination. Next time, the haters will be more careful about what they wish for."	"Transmasculine athletes are hurt by these bills alongside transfeminine ones. You're not wrong to highlight the fact that trans women are the main targets of these bills, as we make convenient boogeymen for the cis public, but I'm not sure pushing trans boys into girls sports is a helpful solution. 

What we really need is deep and sustained organizing efforts within our communities, and allied with other communities seeking brighter futures, to help see us through this storm and make a world where we are free to be ourselves.

Don't forget there's some places that are supposedly trying to mandate.. genital inspections for kids sports. But that's totally not any sketcher than a girl with a slightly too deep voice going to the bathroom right?
If these people were gonna be convinced by trans men in women's sports, it would have been when Mack Beggs won the Texas girls wrestling title two years in a row because they wouldn't let him compete in the boys league. Reason means nothing to them, only hate.
Same with bathrooms, I bet. I doubt cis women feel less threatened by fully transitioned trans men being forced to use the women's room than they are the occasional pre- or early-transition trans woman using the women's room.
this, trans boys in girls sports generally feel the same way about that as trans girls in boys sports

forcing trans boys into girls sports as a ""comeback"" to transphobia against trans girls is not the answer, it just perpetuates more transphobia

transfems, please consider how you'd feel in the reverse situation before you sacrifice our wellbeing for an attempt at yours, thanks :/

Heads up, buddy! There is no difference, a ""trans man"" is a biological ""man"". Ask all the biologists you want, people you don't like are still people. For example, consider my friend Alice. You might think the reason Alice is a 'She' is because of things like her XX chromosomes. It's actually the other way around. All you know about Alice is that she's a woman and because of that, you assume those other physical attributes. I'm not trying to nitpick an individual term. Language like this is easy for a robot like me to spot and is indicative of other gaps in knowledge. Nobody can be expert in everything but there's a danger in the type of advocacy comments like yours have. Consciously or not this discourse is contributing to ideas that harm trans people just so people like you can avoid having your biologicalassumptions corrected.

These bills are banning trans girls in high school from playing sports like tennis with their friends.  They‚Äôre mean spirited and transphobic.
I agree it should be discussed at the Olympic level but these bills all target high school sports. High school sports don‚Äôt fucking matter. Let kids play on the team they want, it literally doesn‚Äôt matter to anybody but them and it can matter a whole lot to them.
They are pushing HARD to broaden transphobia against transmasculine people, with the hysteria surrounding ""our innocent girls being corrupted and rejecting womanhood.""

There is also some speculation that Abbot announced this along with the Texas Attorney General to try and get eyes off the fact that the ex-ERCOT power chief was instructed by Abbot during the deadly freeze last year to put the maximum amount of charges on the Texas populace, leading to Texas citizens as a whole being $3.4 Billion in debt to power companies.

I know this is cold comfort if you don't live in Australia, but I'm incredibly heartened that a conservative politician was slapped down by the voters earlier in the year when they tried to campaign on transphobia.

Trans people are turning conservatives into big government liberals.	"I really don't get what crazy power we have, but we trans people are making Republican conservatives into big government supporters.

I just saw FL gov's spokesperson insisting that Disney will be forced to ""pay their fair share of taxes"", a common refrain of the left against big business... (Its a Fox Business story, so I'm not linking it here because I don't want to give them clicks.)

Remember, this whole fracas between Disney and FL is because Disney (belatedly) is against the Don't Say Gay bill, which started [because of a non-binary kid's mother freaked out when she learned her school was trying to make itself a safe place for them to be...](https://www.politico.com/news/2022/03/29/lawsuit-teen-florida-republicans-dont-say-gay-00021163)"	"As a Canadian I hate to say it but I really hate america. It hasn't always been that way but your country keeps going backwards on everything from lgbtq to race equality. The rest of us are heading towards the future and your country is goose stepping back to the 1940s.
Most republicans have always been big government supporters, but only when it serves their uneducated, unrelenting phobia of anything that isn't cis, white, hetero and christian.  They don't utilize the government to introduce change, they use it to keep things from changing.  It's only purpose to them is to maintain their comfort zone in whatever status quo they think we all still live in, while the rest of us march toward societal progression, you know...like...we should be...doing.
The worst part about this from a Floridians perspective is that I don‚Äôt think the amount Disney will pay in taxes will be close to what Florida will now be paying to take care of Disney‚Äôs infrastructure and emergency services and utilities, all of which Disney paid for before.
They have always been supporters of big government. Big government removed the ""Indians"" for them, and protected their property rights as slaveholders.

Bailouts, military, tax breaks for wealthy, voter suppression, ICE/border, police, war on drugs/DEA, pro stop-and-frisk...

To them big govt is when the govt does something they don't like
The sad thing is that at one time, being republican meant progression and serving the needs of the people. Thanks to the sweeping of white supremacy under the rug and allowing religion to justify judgment, the party that many think they are gifting for no longer exists.
As a Floridian I wholeheartedly agree. At the minimum it will be taken care of by the cheapest bidder and that means construction taking forever as well as having inferior parts and/or engineering.
The fact that a GOP flunky actually stated that he thinks loving vs Virginia was a mistake and that interracial marriage should be left up to the states tells you exactly where they're headed. It's not just gay and trans people and women, they even plan to ban interracial marriage and ultimately head back into segregation. 

I wish I was exaggerating but it's pretty obvious the GOP are trying to drag the entire country into a white straight ""christian"" male eutopia which will be a living hell for everyone else.

Technically it's not either (the bill version of it never made it to be a law), its an order from the governer, and how enforceable that is is still somewhat to be seen.

Even if they cant enforce it it will still result in families of trans children being out through traumatic child abuse cases for no reason or kids being interrogated abt their gender or outed to unsupportive parents because of the mandatory reporting aspect.

Roe v Wade and Prescription Meds	"Perhaps it was naivete, perhaps it's exhaustion from this life-consuming fuckery afoot at all levels of the government, but I didn't see this coming while we were falling down the ladder of depravity. 

The news/ word on the street is that lists of drugs that will be banned for anyone that has ""female"" on their ID are being passed around to pharmacists by state governments in anticipation of anti-abortion bills becoming active. 

The position that the christo-fascists are taking is that any drug which has miscarriage as a potential side effect could possibly be ""abused"" to cause an abortion, thus should be banned for women. This affects so many medications, from blood pressure meds to fucking SSRI's. I also have a lot of additional concern for our trans men and transmasc population that testosterone could fall under this list while transgender rights to healthcare in these christo-fascist states are still being mitigated. 

It's most likely that a pharmacist will still only be able to go off of the gender marker on your ID. I'm sorry that I don't have more information. Not much is out there on this right now, and we won't know the full list of banned medications in the states that are implementing these bans until it's too late. The clock is winding down for states with trigger laws. 

Look up your medications *now*. See if miscarriage is listed as a possible side effect. If you're in one of these red states, check with your pharmacist to see if they will give you *any* info about the medication bans for those ***apparently*** unlucky enough to have ""F"" on their ID.

Currently, the MI Supreme Court interprets the civil rights act to cover sexual orientation and gender identity (see Rouch World, LLC, et al., v Michigan Dep‚Äôt of Civil Rights, et al.). This bill adds in another layer of protection when it comes to protecting civil rights in MI.

Attention trans people of Florida!	"
They‚Äôre trying to propose a bill (hb 935 ) that would bar transgender youth from receiving treatment, which is like mental torture. If you can vote or can ask your parents ask them to say no to hb 935! Thank you for your consideration

ADDITIONAL NOTE: 14 other states are considering similar bills, including Texas (Texas in particular harmfully labeling trans therapy as child abuse) , Tennessee, North Carolina, Alabama, Kentucky, Kansas, and more. For more info look in the article here:

https://www.google.com/amp/s/amp.usatoday.com/amp/7129101002"	"You know, every time I hear about this happening I cant help but think about how these people will be remembered as the mosnters they are in history books. Nothing infuriates and frustrates me more than this type of thing happening to pretty much any group of people.
What the Frick is happening in America???? I normally sit back with popcorn from over here but this is just stupid
As a trans girl in North Carolina, I'm panicking now. What's gonna happen?
God, I hate my state. Northern Florida runs everything despite belong less populated than Southern Florida. I graduate college in a month but I have no idea where to go after that.

Arkansas already passed it. Now we‚Äôre passing laws that allow teachers to discriminate against their trans students. If anyone has a voice out there, please try and stop your state from getting as bad as ours is. I‚Äôm begging everyone old enough to vote to reach out to anyone you can and make them stop this madness.


Edit: here‚Äôs a picture of a newspaper I found on the new bill

It's time for corporate america to pull out if all of these states and stop all political funding of the repugnican party
Once they saw Arkansas got away with all, all the rest jumped on board. Sick in the head.
This is so scary omg

That form only works for trans athletes. I am a 62 yr old trans woman in Florida but I am not an athlete. I have input as a trans woman.
It‚Äôs just gonna ban hrt and surgery for people under 21 for you guys, but in Florida it would be (if passed) 18 years old. Even then that‚Äôs still bad as teenage years are when it‚Äôs most important
Isn‚Äôt it obvious?
No, if anything this is child abuse. This place isn‚Äôt for bigots like you
And trans youth
Alright, luckily I think I'll be ok because I don't plan to stay in this country long but this is absolutely awful. The people doing this are horrible. Is it that fucking hard just to let people be themselves? Also, thank you you the reply and the explanation.
I still plan to stay, I have family here, if anything I‚Äôll just move to somewhere progressive like New York or Canada, idk maybe it‚Äôs my hard coded patriotism kicking in, but do what you gotta do, just so you know Canada seems like a friendly neighbor ig
Have you always lived in america or have you moved I‚Äôm not sure
Plus I don‚Äôt think america is that bad as a whole, don‚Äôt judge something by the sum of its parts, joe biden has made pretty significant changes in our favor over the short couple of months he‚Äôs been president alone, it‚Äôs mainly more republican states like Florida or georgia
Canada was my plan, its not too far and I heard it's nice. I wish you the best of luck and a happy life, just remember to be safe, it's 2021 and half the country still doesn't accept us as real people.
I was born here, its not a feat place to be but it certainly is better than many other places. I'd just rather go somewhere with better Healthcare.
Yeah, right now I‚Äôm fine with america I don‚Äôt think I could do something like move that takes a lot of emotional weight but I‚Äôll probably move to California especially since I‚Äôm used to sunny beaches and Canada is a different climate, plus it has Disneyland, but then again I‚Äôd be leaving Disney world :(
Agreed, I always am upset by people saying it‚Äôs the greatest nation. I mean it‚Äôs probably in the top 10, if not top 5, but definitely not number one
Cali is too populated for me, big cities have always been scary to me
Definitely not #1 also sorry for the typo, great not feat
Same, maybe a quieter area of New York then, yeah.
The state not the city lol
I'd recommend doing lots and lots of research when/if you decide to move. I personally haven't done much yet but I'll make sure I do.
I‚Äôd probably wait till o graduate college, might go to New York to get a good gender surgeon as I know my family has the money
My family has the money but the side that does is super republican (I'm not out to them) and the other side doesn't believe I'm a girl because I've shown myself as masculine my whole life, but what they don't get is I did that so nobody bullied me about it."	mnwmgf	trans	53	0.88	2021-04-10 02:54:53
Well, figured out I'm a trans woman. Here's how it has gone.	"I've been trying to think of a good first post in here, and didn't wanna do the classic ""hi"" post (not that there is anything wrong with those, just not my speed).  So, after a bit of thought, figured I'd just say what I've been going through the past few weeks, what lead up to it, and thoughts on the future.  I know this sub, like all trans-centric subs, gets a lot of curious lurkers, and maybe my story might help someone.

First, the basics.  I'm a 34yo AMAB.  I'm married to one of the best women on earth.  I work an entry level corporate job, and live with three room mates I consider good friends.

I have been some flavor of depressed all my life.  No suicidal ideation or self destructive tendencies (thank chickens, I don't know if I'd been strong enough to resist those), but just this constant feeling of, well, not right.  It was like I didn't belong, like I was always on the outside, and I certainly felt unworthy.  I hated myself.

I always, however, just chalked up the self loathing to poor life choices.  Didn't finish high school, didn't go to college, bad first marriage, bad with money, lazy, out of shape; all of these were what I believed was the source of all of it.  And this had gone on for a *long* time.

About two years ago, a good friend of mine publicly came out as trans.  I really value my friends; they are the family I choose.  So, I started learning about being trans, what it entails, the difficulties trans folk face, and so on.  I wanted to be there for them, so I had to know about all of this.

Interestingly, within a short time after that, a couple more of my friends also came out as trans, and I met some other trans friends through them.  I figured that, well, I've always known interesting people, I'm a geek and a gamer, isn't too odd that I know a bunch of trans folk.  That, and I'd been learning about what it is to be transgender, supporting my friends, so maybe I was just comfortable.

Now, some way, way back-story here, before we go on.  I've always liked feminine clothing.  I didn't tell too many people about this, but it has always been the case.  I was the early teen who tried on his mother's clothes when no one was home.  And in my late teens, I went through a ""cross dressing"" phase.  I was lucky enough to have some very open minded and caring friends, and I often went days presenting female at their place.

I knew one person trans at that point.  They were FtM, and they stayed with one of my friends for a time.  Being young, though, I just assumed they were a masculine lesbian, and didn't dig any further.

Eventually, I drifted away from those friends, and away from feminine clothing.  It didn't occur to me how comfortable I felt in them, and I pushed away the memories of wishing I could just live like that.

Now, add over a decade of time passed, a couple of failed serious relationships, and a ""meh"" series of jobs that generally have paid the bills well enough (not really). Toss in 80 or 90 pounds gained. Along with that, put a successful marriage I do not deserve, and am eternally grateful for.

I had recently, about six months ago, started dieting to lose weight, and have had some success.  I was feeling better about my self image, enough to try shaving my face, something I hadn't done in years.

A good friend and my wife were both curious about me cross dressing again.  They thought it would be fun.  My wife is a cosmetologist, wanted to maybe do my hair and make-up.  I wasn't feeling as fat as I have, so I agreed.

Well, I did, and got a look at myself, and things suddenly felt different.  Really different.  Better.  I felt good.  But the clothes weren't the only thing that changed.  My personality felt more open, I felt less weighed down, just, I felt...

...happy.  I felt happy.  I'd forgotten what it was like.

So, I realized I needed to talk to people.

I reached out to my trans friends.  I talked with them about my feelings, and they gently encouraged me to explore them.  Never anything heavy handed, never what they thought or didn't think I ""was"". Lots of questions and listening, lots of careful guidance towards introspection.

I first thought I was genderqueer.  Like, it has to be in the middle, right?  I'm a little of A, a little of B, somewhere around there.  And I did talk some with the lovely people in r/genderqueer, though I more read their posts, heard what they had to say.  They helped me a lot.

But it wasn't quite right.  I wasn't in the middle, or even a little to one side.  

My room mates were all understanding, and I began presenting feminine at home.  It quickly became an all the time thing when I wasn't out and about.  Unless someone was over who didn't know, I was lounging about in shorts and a camisole, doing chores in a sweater dress, whatever.   I stopped wearing briefs, started wearing panties all the time.  I got a bra.  I really like my bra.

I picked up a skin care routine, because I realized I really like to be pretty.  And there wasn't self loathing involved.  It wasn't ""you look like shit, fix it"".  It was ""I like being pretty and delicate, how can I get there more?"".  I started having an easier time working out, and my diet wasn't as much of a chore.

I had discovered motivation again.  I was experiencing ambition.  I have struggled with ambition for over a decade.

This pushed me to more talks with my friends, more thoughts, more discussion...

It was interesting where the revelation came from.  I had messaged one of my trans friends, and asked her ""Do you know any exercises that target and tone the pectorals, but don't work the arms very hard?"". 

Yeah, I know, that should been a revelation moment.  But it wasn't yet. It did, however, allow her to answer in the most witty way possible, which was to send a picture of the chemical composition of estrogen.

I loved the humor in it.  I'm a nerd, it was a science joke, it was great.  I showed my wife, she... didn't laugh.

She was suddenly concerned with what would happen if I decided to go on hormones.

So, we had a talk.  I told her I wasn't considering that at all, but hypothetically, we could absolutely look through what that would entail.  So I read up with her, looked into the physiological changes estrogen would cause.  I told her the truth, that no matter who I am, or realize I am, I still love her, and always will.  And that helped her, and she was better, and supportive.

And now, I had hormone therapy on the brain.  And how difficult it would be to get, *hypothetically*.  And how much it would cost, *hypothetically*.  And how long changes take, *hypothetically*.

And I watched videos, and I realized that my self loathing, and my lack of ambition, and my feelings of isolation and being on the outside, could all be marked up to gender dysphoria.

And I talked with my friends more.  And I asked myself more questions.  And I finally came to a conclusion.

And I contacted a lot of my friends, trans and not, and told them my revelation: I am a woman.  I am a trans woman.

And a lot asked if I was sure.

And I told them yes.

And a lot of them then said something to the effect of, ""Fucking hell, took you long enough to figure it out, we've known for months/years.  Congratulations, love.""

O_O

Apparently, I was one of the few surprised.

So, here I am.  I'm still not publicly out, but I know who and what I am, and it helps SO much.  It's like a limiter had been taken off my brain.  I'm happy. I'm actually fucking happy.

And I'm terrified.  There is so much ahead of me.  There are so many people in the world that already hate me, and they've never even met me.

But I am also amazingly lucky.  I have friends who are ridiculously supportive, and a wife who is not only overjoyed to see me happy again, but honestly gets a kick out of buying me clothes and shopping with me.

As of where I'm going, I'm doing what a few friends recommended, which is slowly edging towards public presentation.  I'm ""feminizing"" my masculine styles, slowly switching out of my old ""potato sack"" clothes, working my way I to the feminine side of androgynous for now.

I figure early next year, maybe February, I'll look into the medical side of things.  Talk to a doctor and a therapist.  Look into HRT.

Because, well, I'm a woman.  Always have been.  Just took me way too long to find myself.

Anywho, if you've read through all this, thank you.  If you're lurking in here, unsure of who or where you are right now, I hope it helped.  And if anyone has advice, omg, FEEL FREE to stick it in the comments.  I'm game for any tidbits of knowledge, and I'm sure others reading this would love it too.

And, well, I guess... hi.  :-)"	"I don't usually read long posts cause I'm kinda lazy, but I did really enjoy reading that :D Welcome!

I've come out to two people. One was my roommate and it was intentional. The other was her boyfriend, and one of my best friends. I didn't realize he had come over and walked out of my room in a spaghetti strap top and shorts. I saw him, ran back in my room and hyperventilated for a minute before changing. It was really awkward because nobody said anything, but I followed him out when he left to talk to him about it. Basically he said that he didn't realize there was anything abnormal with how I was dressed until went back in my room. He's said that I'll probably surprised at the number of our friends that won't be at all surprised. The bit about your friends having known for years reminded me of that. 

I'm really happy for you, and can't wait to post my recap here one day.
Wow, your story mirrors mine except I'm still up at the stage of HRT on the brain and how my wife might come around to that idea of I ever brought it up to her.  Nice write-up and thanks for sharing.  Helps me feel I'm not alone in how I feel

Democrats unveiling ‚ÄòTransgender Bill of Rights‚Äô		"hope that anything at all comes from it
It's a nice gesture and all, but obviously codified law doesn't mean much when it can all be reversed later. We need to demand more. We need real change.
I've read the proposed [text of the bill](https://legiscan.com/US/text/HR1209/2021) and it seems to be very strong. I also contacted my Congressperson and thanked him for cosponsoring the bill.  If you have the energy and time to contact your representative this is one of those times that it is really important to do so. Since his seat is open in this election I will also be writing to all of the people running to replace him and assessing their support of the measure as an important guide to how I will be voting in the upcoming primary.

We are a small minority of the population, so it is vitally important that we communicate our support for this legislation to the people who have the actual power to get it passed into law. There's also a cheeky little provision currently in the bill that would codify Roe/Casey.
Nothing but virtue signaling on their part. This isn't getting through the Senate.
Doubtful
You are absolutely correct. Though it is nice to see something not directly attacking the community
I thought the whole reason Roe V. Wade was able to be overturned was because it wasn't codified into law...
I know
That definitely is the reason. I don't buy the idea that even making it codified law is good enough. Even if it's baked into the law, then what's to stop Republicans from straight up ignoring it. Even when democrats hold power, they can't or won't hold Republicans accountable. And what happens when Republicans hold power? Well, we've seen the consequences. The constitution and the rule of law only matters to them when it reinforces their beliefs.

The Oklahoma State Legislature is set to vote on SB129 tomorrow. It would effectively outlaw gender affirming care for everyone under 26 if passed.	You might know the bill as the ‚ÄúMillstone Act‚Äù. It‚Äôs a huge step toward the genocide of trans people in Oklahoma. They aren‚Äôt even using the excuse of ‚Äúprotecting the children‚Äù anymore. I‚Äôve contacted my representatives (if you‚Äôre here, please do the same) and the office of one, a Republican, responded that the bill seemed unlikely to pass. Regardless, it makes it pretty clear how the people in power in this state feel about us. Please keep tomorrow (February 8) in mind, whether you‚Äôre from Oklahoma or not.	"If they don't have a  Ph.D in medicine they don't deserve to make laws regarding anyone's anatomy
If passed, it will and should be challenged or blocked. It goes against the 14th amendment as it restricts people from care, which cis people have access to, and is based entirely on discrimination.
Also an Oklahoman, very worried about tomorrow.
I'm sorry
26 is a super arbitrary number...
The direction Oklahoma is going rn isn't looking to good, I'm still kinda confused how marijuana managed to slip through but not trans rights.
Oh man, I didn't realize the vote was here. I haven't seen anything about the date before this post.

After the protest yesterday, the bill appears to have been revised to age 18. Still needs to be shot down, though. It is now titled SB 613.
My government teacher told my class, that when the country to takes a step backwards like this, to get mad and not allow it
The State Senator who created the bill had been a history and government teacher before going into government. And there‚Äôs an article, though I‚Äôm not 100% where it comes from, that said he never spoke to a trans person when creating the bill. It‚Äôs a complete joke
I actually emailed the ACLU of Oklahoma a few weeks ago, and they responded saying they were preparing to fight it as soon as it passes, if it does
The response I got from my representative gave me a bit of hope, but I‚Äôm still really worried too
Thank you for the solidarity ‚ù§Ô∏è
It‚Äôs actually when people age out of their parents insurance. That shows how actively malicious this act is.
It's when your hip bones fuse. When your breast tissue finishes developing.
Well hell, i didnt expect there to be a reason honestly
Exactly. There‚Äôs a dispensary in pretty much every town, yet anytime a conservative makes a comic about ‚Äúleftist society‚Äù they always have marijuana everywhere??? But it brings more revenue into the state (to inevitably be mismanaged)
yeah and it did pass as sb 613
every single history teacher that isn't using this to center the discussion around the weimarr republic and the descent into fascism is complicit.
btw have you heard anything about the state capital being stormed? I had a friend going on about it.
I‚Äôve heard about [this](https://kfor.com/news/oklahoma-legislature/trans-rights-group-peacefully-protests-at-oklahoma-capitol/amp/). It looks like it‚Äôs being blown out of proportion in the reports, surprise surprise. I wish I was there, but I live over an hour from OKC and don‚Äôt have a car of my own, unfortunately
Here‚Äôs a quote that sums it up pretty well; 
Political commentators, who were not at Monday‚Äôs protest, have reshared the video and used the terms ‚Äúmilitant‚Äù to describe the activists. One commentator said, ‚ÄúTrans Lives Matter stormed and occupied the Oklahoma capitol today.‚Äù

However, those characterizations are not accurate.

Demonstrators were let in by Oklahoma State Troopers and Capitol security staff. Each person walked through a metal detector.

They‚Äôre trying to make a peaceful protest look like January 6. This is so stupid

How do I say thank you to an extremely nice pharmacist?	"I‚Äôm not 100% sure this is the ideal place to post this but the entire story is about me going to pick up my hormones for the first time and idk what other sub I could possibly post this in so here goes. 

Background info: I had gone to CVS two days in a row to ask about my HRT prescription that was two days late at this point. I was informed that there was a problem with my insurance and the hormones were stuck on hold for an unknown amount of time, I was afraid there‚Äôd be a problem with insurance but I hoped there wouldn‚Äôt be. I was getting desperate, I was so close to being where I needed to be. The pharmacist was super nice and apologetic the first day I came in, even though literally none of it was his fault. I told him I‚Äôd be back the next day and went and sat in my car and cried. 

Now, this is when things get interesting. I came back the day after. It‚Äôs busy at the pharmacy counter so I have to wait in line but he spots me and nods at me while I‚Äôm waiting (he knows what‚Äôs up), once I get up the counter I ask him if he can check on the prescription again. He does, no luck. I was once again on the verge of tears. But then he turns to look at me and says something to the effect of ‚Äúscrew it. So long as you‚Äôre okay with paying out of pocket I‚Äôm just gonna remove the hold on these myself. You‚Äôve put in a lot of miles to get where you are right now and it‚Äôs not fair to make you wait.‚Äù (Honestly I didn‚Äôt even know they could do that)

I ended up having to sprint back up the street in 97 degree heat to feed my parking meter. It wasn‚Äôt working right and would only let me pay for 20 minutes of parking at a time but I was gonna have to wait in CVS for at least 30. Shit fuck. Well if I get a ticket I‚Äôll just cross that bridge when I come to to it. After that I sat/paced around the store anxiously until they called my name. When i walked up to the counter to pay I actually did cry a little bit. I thanked them a bunch of times and practically jumped out the door. 

I‚Äôm just wondering if there‚Äôs anything else I could honestly do to thank them? Is it weird to get your pharmacist a thank you card or something like that? Is that allowed? I‚Äôm a month on T now but I just found out yesterday when I finally received the bill from the health center in the mail that it took until last Friday for my insurance claim to actually be processed (it didn‚Äôt even go through so I‚Äôm having to pay out of pocket for that too :( )so I‚Äôm convinced I literally would not be where I am now if he hadn‚Äôt helped me out like that. 

If you made it this far, thanks for reading. Any advice is appreciated. for the record I also did get extremely lucky and did not in fact get a parking ticket :)

(Edit for clarity)"	"Message the store he works at and say that he helped you out a lot, maybe include a note that‚Äôs specifically for him. It‚Äôs not weird to thank your doctors (and pharmacists are healthcare professionals)
i would call, get the manager, and directly tell the manager how helpful the pharmacist was. theyll be able to pass on the message and they'll also have that recognition from their manager.

cards/gifts often arent allowed, especially in medical jobs. i would avoid that.
This is so sweet of you ‚ò∫
Keep in mind that what he did may have been against protocol so maybe just say that he was supportive and helpful when you were having a hard time, or something to that effect. I'm sure he'd appreciate the thanks, and his management should know that he went the extra mile but maybe just go and say it to him directly to avoid any possible complications.
Yeah that was what I was thinking. I had a nice review of the location I went to drafted for a while but i wasn‚Äôt sure if I should post it because I don‚Äôt know if I should broadcast what happened like that bc I don‚Äôt want him to get in trouble with management or anything like that. I am thinking about going back just to tell him thank you but I‚Äôm not sure if that‚Äôs weird. I‚Äôm scared of holding up the line if there are other people who actually need to pick up prescriptions. I might just tell him when I go get my refill in like 2 months but that feels like waiting too long aha
It's never too long but you can try to schedule your visit around slower periods if you want to do it sooner. Or just go in when you're available but be willing to wait for the line to die down/let people go ahead of you."	phupse	trans	41	0.95	2021-09-04 16:29:06

Probably because the idiots in office think that people are trying to make their kids change gender to destroy society or something
I don't know Arkansas, but it's normally a two thirds (2/3) vote. Again, I'm not well versed in Arkansas's legislative branch, but I think there's enough liberals and centrists and really just decent human beings that they won't be able to pass it
I just googled Arkansas's laws. What's the point of a veto if it only takes the same amount of votes????
Oh of course, I forgot about our ‚Äútrans agenda‚Äù and how we are forcing straight white men to wear maid dresses and turn super heroes into black lesbians /s
It's stupid. 

It was already overrided. The bill was passed. We lost.
In a serious answer saying it is well intentioned is smoothing the ego of those proposing it. If you don‚Äôt they dig in harder, if you‚Äôre nice about saying they are wrong there is a chance they might change their mind. Looking at other comments this veto doesn‚Äôt stop the bill but makes the state legislature reconsider it. The governor still needs to turn a few votes to dismiss it. Saying it‚Äôs well intentioned gives legislators an out to consider everything and change their mind, in a political sense. It also shows he is willing to horse trade with local reps for them to change their mind.
My only hope is that because of this temporary loss we go all the way to the Supreme Court and make sure this *never* happens again
Or not. For fuck sake Arkansas
I really want to be optimistic about this but I just don't have the capacity anymore. In the south- Republicans win. It doesn't matter what the Supreme Court says or not. 

The Supreme Court made a law protecting abortion but young women still get beaten and harrassed by evangelical crazies outside of planned parenthood centers for wanting to get/getting an abortion.

Trans rights protections were passed but many doctors and surgeons still make you jump through as many hoops as they can make you in order to try and stop you. 

Gays are protected but when I came out to my first therapist she recommended me to read the Bible and pray, to not ""jump"" into an identity too quick.

As long as Republicans have any sort of power- they will bend it and bend it to their advantage as much as possible to push their bullshit agenda onto people who just want to live their own lives. It doesn't matter what happens from here on out- atleast until all the old wrinkly bitches in Congress finally croak over."	mks7el	trans	43	0.95	2021-04-05 19:05:04

is it okay if I want to quit transitioning because of the anti trans bills?	Part of me wants to continue but it doesn't seem worth it if I'm arrested or killed. I'm 24 and have been on hrt 3 months. I'm in Oklahoma as well.	"Yes you can quit if you want. But for me to quit it would be like dying. I will live as I wish.
That‚Äôs exactly what they want you to do! I wouldn‚Äôt stop for anyone. If you feel unsafe maybe just don‚Äôt socially transition yet, but I wouldn‚Äôt stop taking my medicine.
Staying safe is a priority so it's ok to stop if you are worried. You can always retransition later on. You aren't any less valid if you stop. I'm sorry it even has to come to this. Would you be able to move? Do you want to? 

Stay safe.
Whatever you decide for yourself is okay. The first thing all of us want for you is to be safe. This is closely followed by happy, but that only works if you are keeping yourself safe first. So whatever you need to do.
Stay safe and survive!
I think anything you do that makes you comfortable is what *you* feel is the right thing to do for *you* is ‚Äúok.‚Äù You do not need anyone‚Äôs approval or permission to transition, and you don‚Äôt need anyone‚Äôs approval or permission to pause in your transition. 
 
Everyone needs to do what‚Äôs best for their own situation. You are valid either way. Pausing your transition doesn‚Äôt have any impact on your validity as a trans person.
Transitioning has always been a choice made when fear of societal rejection is outweighed by dysphoria/euphoria. If you are not at that stage, I would argue that transitioning is probably a bad idea. 

It‚Äôs important that you have a good idea of the actual risk. The chances that you will be arrested or killed are obviously extremely low, unless you‚Äôre a sex worker or deal in some other kind of risky work. Don‚Äôt make a rash decision based on proposed bills. But if you determine that transitioning is not worth it to you, I encourage you to make the decision that is right for you. The trans community will support you either way.
But girl you cant give up the future start's now üá´üá∑üíïü•ñüè≥Ô∏è‚Äç‚ößÔ∏è, Ps im assuming your a trans girl i dont see any photo's of you to know for sure or Mtf or Ftm so yeah no offense.
üò≤üò£üò¢ü•∫ honey you do you. You do what you have to, but don‚Äôt let this get to you. You keep your head up and keep your thoughts on what you want. When and how will happen on its own. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to even post that question. The ones that are failing all of us to be free are not real Americans, are not really ones who believe in freedom.
Definitely a thought that has been crossing my mind but I‚Äôm 5 years in and it would be super hard to de transition also I feel like I‚Äôm in a situation where it doesn‚Äôt feel like it would be that bad but only because I literally can‚Äôt remember how bad being pre transition was. It‚Äôs ok to stop because it wouldn‚Äôt be worth it for now or even never.
Everyone is going to say that you should do what you can to be safe. What is safe though? Is not transitioning safe for you? How long before you'll want to end your own life because you quit? What regrets will you carry? Will you be safe from depression and suicide that might come with those regrets? Would you be happy to be buried as the wrong gender if something were to happen?

I know I have the privilege of living in a state that is currently protecting trans people and our rights, but if it came down to it I'd rather die as my true self and on my feet than hiding and dying as someone else.
If that is the option you go with, just remember it doesn‚Äôt have to be forever and you can always try again when you are feeling safer ü§ç
It‚Äôs not okay for the government to make you not want to transition.  It‚Äôs okay for you to make decisions that will keep you safe, but the situation itself is not okay.
Check the anti trans legislation in your state specifically. That way you'll know who is in your corner and where the political climate is locally. Then you can make an informed decision about your safety.
Genocides mean the eradication of a people. This is how they want us to think. üò¨
Can you seek your care in another state? Are you college age where you could attend in a safe state and continue your care? If you quit, they win. Unless you are using your free will to quit.
Death before detransition. That‚Äôs my philosophy
This is most likely what I'll end up doing. Yeah I would feel better just keeping the hrt but maybe dressing a little fem. Thanks
I'm mtf. I hope I can be strong enough.
Thanks to states that are offering protections!
I could in another state if I had too I think. I'm 24. I've been thinking about with my counselor on deciding if I should go back finish getting my credits.
I hear you, it‚Äôs getting scary. 

I transitioned at 42‚Ä¶ i thought it was finally safe after getting some federal protections‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs been 2 years, and Jesus Christ, America went down hill fast. 

I travel for work‚Ä¶ so visit a lot of these Red states, and have met the crazy‚Ä¶ 

Personally I won‚Äôt stop my journey, this is the first time in my life i feel in Control, am happy, and am unapologetically me‚Ä¶

I would rather die than go back. I once left my Depo at Home for a trip and had a panic attack for not taking it just once‚Ä¶ i don‚Äôt think I‚Äôd take it well if I were cut off. 

Best advice I can give is to try to find resources, stock pike your HRT, change as many official documents as you can with gender markers and make, if you haven‚Äôt done so‚Ä¶ and see if you can move to a safer state.

I got myself a job with a global company, and I believe they‚Äôd move me out of the country if it got bad enough‚Ä¶ if a position was available‚Ä¶

But do what you have to do ti take care of yourself and your mental health. That takes priority. /huuug
You are strong enough these bill's are transphobic and they are made from close minded people who don't understand our way of life but we must over come that, we have eachother to persevere this. ü•∞üòå

is this true that conversion therapy is going the illegal in ENGLAND?		"Rishi is proposing to ban it, but early days, he may yet fail, there are more tory rebals than there used to be. I think the ban would apply to Wales too, not just England
Considering the government right now there's gonna be a clause like ""only banned for NHS/government recognised trans people""
the fact it isn‚Äôt is boggling but if/when it does it‚Äôs small step forward while the government is already talking 2 steps back with not allowing scotland to pass self id, and rishi wanting to rework the equality act to further put down trans ppl.
I wouldn't get my hopes up. He's doing this to distract from his Government's transphobia/blocking the Scottish reforms. He'll probably drop it.
I don't know much about the British government system, but the article calls it a bill, so I'm assuming we'll have to wait for it to be passed before it takes effect, if it even passes.
There is a lot of quotation marks in this article. Now I'm wondering why. Does author of that article in favor of conversion therapies or they don't believe in government?
Cllllllassic tory shit. This is good, but they are absolutely doing this so that when they block Scottish self ID they can go ""see!? We don't hate you!"".

Torys are not republicans. They are smarter. They don't care about lgbt people either way, we are a tool to be used for electoral games.
I call bullshit. If those slimy wankers told me the sky was blue I'd go and check for myself
I really hope it goes through, England and Wales need more trans support
Yes. After it has been approved by the commons (some government bills have been rejected by the commons in the past) and any amendments to it by the Lords (Lords can not veto it outright,  and can be overriden by the commons after so many times), it goes to the king. It takes a bit longer. The king acts these days as a supervisor with the national interest and as a fail-safe for democracy. Unless a Bill would be catastrophic to peace or democracy then he is constitionally required to sign it into law. Any exercise of powers has to be performed under strict conditions. Example of this is as of 2022 (act establishing a deadualt fixed election date), with the removal of the fixed-term parliament he once again has the power to dissolve  and call a general election. The King can refuse the request of a pm to do this (a pm can not demand, and the pm does not personally hold the power) to dissolve parliament and call a general election under the Lascells principles.

Iowans, we need to do something.	Today I learned governor of Iowa Kim Reynolds is considering a bill to remove trans people from any sort or protection. House Bill 2164 would make it legal to fire people, deny housing, etc. for simply being trans. We need to stop this. We need to contact her and say trans people deserve the same human rights as anyone. Her number can be found through Google. I'm not sure what I'd do, as I'd definitely lose my job if it became legal to fire me for my identity. I have friends who'd be unable to find a place to live. I'm hoping if enough of us call, maybe she'll at least consider not supporting it. I'm sorry if this isn't allowed, I didn't see anything in the rules against it, but we'll see. I figured if there's anywhere to search for support in fighting this injustice, it would be Reddit. I'm posting this a few places, and invite y'all to share, because this is a serious issue.	"I truly believe that Trans Rights is the most important civil rights movement of our era. Most people judge us so harshly and openly discriminate and treat us as less than human. Our allies and advocates are usually not very diplomatic and/or just lump us in with all the issues they want to address. I feel we are beleaguered. We‚Äôre like pariahs. I feel like society has advanced to a point where we sympathize with any group facing adversity and yet it‚Äôs almost socially accepted to discriminate against transgender people, even to the point of persecution, across all races, religions, political leanings, and institutions. I might get a lot of backlash for this but I feel that people have forgotten that we‚Äôre people and didn‚Äôt just arrive at a decision all Willy-Nilly. We have faced our own plight. Stared it down and taken a brave step onto the unknown. Knowing full well what it entails in today‚Äôs society. We are strong. We are brave. We are beautiful. And someday the people will open their eyes and feel awful for their past transgressions against us. Until then, I wish them all the best in the world.
This needs to be much much higher, anything we can do from the UK to help??
You could call Kim Reynolds and ask her to not approve the bill/leave a message. They won't ask if your from Iowa, not can they request any evidence of citizenship, so if you don't have issues with calling and long distance charges that would help. Otherwise, sharing about this issue on any form of social media helps get the word out about this attempt to legalize discrimination which should in turn help prevent it's progression.

How can we help?	Howdy folks, I want to start off by saying I'm not trans. But as someone with half a brain and some humanity left in me, the bill passed in the Arkansas legislature today absolutely appalls me. I wanted to ask if anyone here knew how best I and others who oppose this measure can best help to repeal this bill. What ideas have you got?	"Violence against the state would be helpful ü§£ü§£
Sorry I'm in Europe and don't follow the news..what was passed today?
Believe me if I could I would, but I don't think ""Be gay do crime"" is a legitimate legal defense ü§∑

True....true....but....

You don't need to worry about legitimate legal defense if there's no state left to prosecute you ü§îü§î This is big brain hour. For legal reasons, this is a joke üòÇ
Wasn't it for any age? (I'm not from america so idk)
If I remember correctly, it explicitly bans the gender-conformijg treatment (suppressants, HRT, any surgeries, etc) for minors, and gives private insurance the right to deny gender conforming treatments for trans people of any age. The Governor of the state just recently passed a bill banning trans children from playing on sports teams of the gender they identify with, and another recent bill allows health care providers to deny treatment to anyone on ""religious or moral reasons"" (aka for being gay/trans/POC/etc).

What's particularly bad about this ban is it doesn't just say ""don't provide care,"" there's very harsh punishments for physicians who refuse to abide by the new lay, including revoking of medical licenses, clinic closures, and heavy fines

GOP governor on NC-style Bathroom Bill: ‚ÄúWhy? Why would we? Why would anybody need it? Is it an issue?		"Clearly Bevins apparently learned from North Carolina‚Äôs Gov. Pat McCrory train-wrecked political career ‚Äî a gamble that didn‚Äôt pay dividends even though Trump carried the state.

This isnt an about face. In both cases he's opposing additional regulations, for or against doesn't matter. I doubt he cares about transpeople or hates them. He's just being a small government Republican
Up next: trans equivalent of log cabin republicans?
>He's just being a small government Republican

I wish more small government Republicans would be like him though, and not consider it to be one of those essential functions of government to fuck trans people over endlessly
Damn few of those around these days. The federal GOP politicians seem to want a government small enough to fit in Putin's pocket.

Absolutely stupid Florida bill banning transgender care for minors and blocking coverage for adults clears first House		"Can't wait for the oceans to rise just a tiny bit and erase the entire state...
A summary of the bill as of 3/26/23:

[CS/HB 1421 2023](https://www.flsenate.gov/Session/Bill/2023/1421) is a bill that severely impacts gender care in Florida. 

This bill:

- Authorizes courts in Florida to intervene in child custody cases to protect children from gender clinical interventions in another state.
Prohibits state agencies, political subdivisions, and public postsecondary institutions from using funds for gender clinical interventions.
- Prevents changes to a person's biological sex on a birth certificate except for scrivener's errors or cases where the sex characteristics were ambiguous at birth.
- Requires immediate suspension of the license of any health care practitioner arrested for providing gender clinical interventions to minors.
- Defines ""gender clinical interventions"" and prohibits these interventions for minors, with some exceptions.
- Requires physicians providing gender clinical interventions to maintain professional liability coverage and obtain informed written consent from adult patients.
- Prohibits health insurance policies and health maintenance contracts from providing coverage for gender clinical interventions.
- Holds physicians liable for injuries and wrongful death caused by gender clinical interventions, with provisions for damages, attorney fees, and statute of limitations.
At this point it doesn‚Äôt surprise me why I left the U.S
Also takes away the ability to see a PA or NP for care. Removes the ability to use telehealth and forces you to sign consent each time. This removes the ability to access services like Plume and Folx and if the form is like a sample one proposed earlier, it basically says ""this is all experimental and can ruin your life"""	122odjx	trans	34	0.89	2023-03-26 14:43:25
Reason for Hope?	That‚Äôs it, with the Texas bill, the war in Europe, and an ever flowing wave of transphobia, I feel like the world gets bleaker and bleaker ever day. I know this is a silly post, but I need it right now, more than anything else. Is there any point to holding onto hope anymore, or is that some foolish wish?	"Hope is all that is not self-destructive.  War, hate, these things destroy themselves (albeit hurting others in the process).

Hope, however, rides out the storm.  So long as there are good people, hope will never die out, unlike the seemingly-invincible adversaries now plaguing our world.  

Transness in these times is trying, at best, but it's a meaningful stance.  ""I know who I am, no matter what you tell me"".

Those of us with hope will simply wait for this storm to pass.
Things are bleak, but people are fighting it. Abbott's bill is being challenged by people online and probably in person. The people of Russia are protesting against the attacks as well. There are terrible, toxic, and evil people doing things that match their descriptions, but people will always push against those doing the wrong thing.

We are on the right side of history. You are making history every single time you inhale. You're not done making marks on this world, and I hope that day is very very far away.

We'll get through this. üíñ
Look back at the darker times when if you were slightly different in anyway you were cast out but now people are being excepted more and more sure there are those people who are still stuck on the past buts that‚Äôs exactly what it is ‚Äúthe past‚Äù and eventually the past dies and with it comes a new mind set for the younger generation ‚ò∫Ô∏è
I go out in public as who I am and I just don't run into problems. Nobody cares. I just do my thing. If anyone looks at me it is probably because they are attracted to me and wanna talk.

The people to be afraid of is those that know that you are trans and they have some sort of transphobia. Like your voice outing you or you told them upfront who you really are and they do have some sort of internalized transphobia while admitting at the same time this is something they need to find out more about. With these folks, things can get ugly. Just be you and be careful with who you interact with.
i don‚Äôt really have much‚Ä¶ i know that you were asking for some but i‚Äôm also in your place

ive heard for us; we need to keep going no matter what. even if we‚Äôre persecuted now it may not be bad in the future, but the only way to know is to get there
Though I do genuinely think it will improve and both positions you mentioned, abbot‚Äôs and putin‚Äôs are entirely untenable, would you rather die standing or live on your knees? If you truly feel all is lost and nothing matters what harm can be done by living on and attempting to live a truly notable and upstanding life in spite of it all?
Hope is always important, even if it's hard to find. At the end of the day, we all get this one life to live, so we should do our best to make the most of it despite circumstances. These past few years have been a lot. It seems just like a never-ending mess of one bad thing after another. 

Find something that gives you hope. For me, I watch One Topic At A Time on youtube. Wholesome guy with a wholesome community who support LGBTQ+ people and give me hope when I feel it flag. Or I talk to my sibling, or walk my dogs, or dive into a project, or listen to my favorite music. Just anything really that can lift my spirits. So find something that can help you recharge your own hope when you feel it start to flag, because it is always important to hold onto hope.
Hope is always worth holding onto.  It's not always easy to hope, especially when you need to deal with any demons of your own and your compassion hits you when you see all the horrible things happening to other people, but don't for a second doubt the power that hope brings.

Look to history. Life gets better for humanity consistently. There's a quote that appeared in an XKCD which I can't find  from the 1600s where the author said something along the lines of ""Every generation is convinced that theirs will be the last of the species yet the inevitable  trend of humanity is improvement""

In the short term? It's a bad time. Knowing Texas, Abbott's bill will make it to law. Nobody knows if the Russian invasion of Ukraine will escalate further yet.

In the long term? It gets better. For everybody. Not at the same rate, but it gets better.

 There is always reason to hope, and that hope can carry you forwards.
I also feel like shit over this and have not done well trying to get people to talk to in this time as I‚Äôm mostly ignored entirely 

So if you wanna talk sometime I‚Äôm hereü•∫
I have to say as bad as it is and feels this day the difference between the lgbtq struggle when I graduated high school in 1984 vs this day just leaps and bounds a beyond better a world so much acception so much left to do.The people who hate will never stop fighting; it's the ugly part of humanity and the same as it ever was.
Times are bleak, it seems like death is on everyone‚Äôs doorstep. But, there‚Äôs also good people. There‚Äôs also perseverance. When I feel like I‚Äôm stuck with no chance to improve, I remember stuff like the Warsaw Uprising, with defiant Poles rising up against their invaders and eventually possibly 98% of Warsaw was systematically destroyed. The uprising was quelled, the Germans won.

But the Polish people didn‚Äôt give up. Even after the city of Warsaw was reduced to less than even a shadow of its former self, they kept fighting, they kept rebelling, and eventually they broke free.

I think of the the Little Ships of Dunkirk, rescuing allied soldiers that were facing certain death.

I think of perseverance of all of humanity, to leave Africa, their origin, and deliberately heading to colder, harsher climes they weren‚Äôt built for.

Mankind is built on hope. We survive based on the idea that the future will be brighter and better, the idea that when it‚Äôs all over we‚Äôll be rewarded. And, in sticking through the hardest, bleakest times, we are rewarded with more days to come. To wax poetic, every dusk has a dawn. There‚Äôs also something good to come.

Planned Parenthood Informed Consent Experience	"Hello everyone,

I had my first appointment today at the Planned Parenthood in Milwaukee, OR and I wanted to share my experience in case it helps anyone on the fence about it.

Let me just say, the staff there were amazing! They had the infrastructure and processes setup to handle covid precautions perfectly. Of course, standard stuff, they asked me what my preferred name and pronouns were during check in. Even though my insurance is technically out of network, I think they are going to be able to bill them because I only had to pay a $40 copay. 

I was really nervous because it was my first time trying my voice in public, and the first time I was able to go by my preferred name in person. Despite that, they made me feel comfortable. They called me back into the room, and the nurse gathered medical history information and asked some questions. The first time they measured my blood pressure it was 180/90 because of how nervous I was feeling. By the end though, it dropped significantly.

One thing that stuck out to me, and I know it is almost certainly just a standard question, is they asked which type of hrt I was seeking, male or female,  and I'm my head it seemed kinda silly at first, but it makes sense. When they asked how I identify, I blurted out female without hesitation, so I at least know I'm confident about that. 

The doctor came in afterwards and we discussed my goals, how long I've been thinking about hrt, and so on. We discussed treatment options, and she outlined some of the pros and cons, and mentioned various side effects. The blood clot speach scared me a little, but not enough to stop me from continuing. She convinced me it was probably worth trying out spiro, so I decided I'd go with a low dose of spiro to start. Because of my health, she recommended starting at a lower dose and seeing how it goes. I'll be starting with 2mg estradiol and 50mg spiro daily and we will see how that goes. As far as blood tests go, she had me get tested for potassium and kidney function. 

The other highlight of my visit was when the nurse came in to draw my blood. She looked at the veins in my arm, and told me how beautiful they were, because they are easy to access. It felt so good. 

So yea, I've got my prescription supposed to be coming in the mail from my pharmacy, the estradiol is listed on their site as under review for drug interaction check, but I'm sure it will be resolved. 

I'm happy to answer any questions, if I can. Like I said , I just figured I would put this out there for anyone else who is nervous."	"I also did pp informed consent for hrt. Because of covid it was a month wait for the phone call interview. Then they scheduled my bloodwork really shortly after. There was a bit of a delay with the pharmacy. Pp has only charged me $40 for a total T test so far. Pharmacy charges like $13 out of pocket but sometimes $30 if they use my insurance for some reason. The syringes and needles are like under $5. I stopped requesting refills for those though because they kept screwing up on those so I just bought a kit online. 

So basically took two months. One month for initial appointment then a bit under while I was waiting to hear from prescription so had to call again and they sorted it out quick. 

I love Planned Parenthood so much ü•∫

It's great yours went so smoothly too. Added mine to help others as well.
Nice! How much would it cost to pay out of pocket for HRT? Can you figure that out by any chance?
Just one appointment?  No months of counseling?  I wish the best hun...
[deleted]
Thank you! I am curious what area you are in. It was honestly surprising how fast and easy it was to get my appointment. I only really waited a week and a half from the date I signed up for the appointment online to the day of. I was willing to drive a bit though to go to the only clinic with in person appointments available around here.
If you are just talking about the medicine itself, it probably depends on what type and dose, but from what she said, and from what I hear, it isn't too bad. I think I've heard good things about good-rx. https://goodrx.com/estradiol The prices don't look too bad.
I am going to see a counselor at some point, but with informed consent, in the US, you just have to state your identity, they acknowledge it, and you can get prescribed the proper meds. Since I was and am confident I want this, I figured no harm in starting now.
I just used their website and booked the appointment through that. They have options for privacy when signing up, so that when they call you, they just say doctor instead of planned parenthood. After setting up the appointment online, they called me a few days before hand for pre registration, but I ended up just taking care of it onsite instead. It probably varies by area, most of the clinics around me had no openings for appointments, so I just grabbed the first available one. It probably has the appointment information on their site, otherwise you will have to call them.
Ah I forgot! Cali. 

I did mine back in fall. I probably could have looked around more for one that had in person and had less of a wait but I don't have a car so I just did my usual clinic. I blame covid for slowing stuff down because otherwise it was pretty streamlined.
Nice!
Ah, yeah, I think things are starting to open up a bit more now. I'd agree that access to a car definitely helps, I just had to have an explanation for where I was going, but I scheduled turning in my apartment keys the same day, so I had a reasonable excuse for going out without having to come up with a lie. I work from home, so it would otherwise be suspicious."	mqji4s	trans	37	0.94	2021-04-14 04:54:02
I am terrified	I was scrolling through tik tok earlier and learned of the terrifying hb 8170 bill. To summarize it‚Äôs a bill that would require teachers to report to a parent if their child is trans and would ban teachers from gendering their trans students correctly. As a partial closeted trans person that lives in an extremely transphobic house hold this could lead to homelessness or worse for me and many other trans kids in the u.s. (sorry if not flaired correctly)	"Hey, I'm a high school teacher. Teachers will not comply. We didn't train and accept a job to ruin kids lives. Just talk to Teachers and let them know the extent of who needs to know. 

I'm supposed to report students suspected of drugs but for the life of me I just can't seem to remember what weed smells like..... till I go home of course.
I'm right there with you. It's scary thinking about the future
So am I. We must destroy the republican party in November
I think everyone trans or otherwise LGBTQ should just leave the country. England is good. So is Scotland. Although they are very far so maybe Canada?
Thank you.  

Civil disobedience is going to become very important in coming years, moreso than it has at any point in this nation's history.
Not all are as worthy of commendation as yourself, regrettably. Many teachers at my school will need to be cautioned of the ire of an iowa and the other attendant ships to be good people
This sounds so creepy and ominous
England's not good for trans folks.
Not all can afford it. Unless things go real bad and The Canucks let us pull off Operation Frequent Wind II

Top Surgery Denied	I've decided to tell you all a little story that hopefully helps some of you maybe? Idk. I guess I'll start where I had a great job, a house, a girlfriend and well everything was going actually really well. At the time I was a year on testosterone and I started taking therapy to get a letter for top surgery, I had looked at many surgeons near my area and found 2 I really liked. I had called about one but was told he doesn't take insurance (me wanting to use my dad's insurance I'm on, it's blue cross blue shield, a very good insurance) so I decided to go with the other surgeon because she takes insurance and her results are amazing. I got told I needed to letters, one from my therapist and the other from my T doctor. I decided that while being in therapy to get my letter I would workout really hard so I started working out alot and getting beefy. I worked hard at my job (graveshift) took care of my dog and house, spent time with my girlfriend and worked out and did therapy. I made time for alot and felt very healthy in many ways.  After 3 months of therapy I got my letter and paid $25 for it and went on a 2 hour drive to go get the one from my doctor and paid $25 for that one too. I sent the surgeon my information, insurance and all that. I did a consultation with her and paid $50 for it and it went well. I later went to an appointment at her office that's 2 hours away from me, I paid around $200 for that appointment. She marked my chest and took measurements, she was very nice and so was everyone else there. She took pictures of my chest and explained everything then told me everything is good and that they will set up my date for surgery. I signed papers at the front desk and got everything set up. My surgery date was 2 weeks from that time. After I left I was very excited and my friends were very excited for me too. I got approved plenty of time off work. With all these things going well with Surgery I had lost 2 workers to covid and my great grandma had passed also due to covid, I attended the funerals and things were hard but I kept going. Work was hard to go to with all of us in the low after losing people. I kept working, I kept working out, I kept trying and fighting even with things already being hard and taking the time off of work to heal. 2 days before my surgery I woke up to a call, it was the front desk lady to the surgeons office, she sounded really upset and told me my insurance didn't accept the surgery and wouldn't cover anything and that they have to cancel everything, she then apologized...I felt broken, I froze and all I could say was okay. I hung up the phone and layed back down and started sobbing, I then called work and told them I can't go in. It was marked as an absence. I was later reminded of the surgery when I told work to cancel that request. I was also reminded when friends messaged me, being reminded hurt knowing I got so damn close to something I've wanted pretty much my whole life for it to get taken away 2 days before it was supposed to happen..with that on top of losing 3 people within a short amount of time I had stopped working out, I missed alot of work and soon got terminated, my girlfriend was toxic (very long story) so I left her, I then became very sick and couldn't get a job. I had to use the $6000 I had saved up on the side to pay rent, bills and for my dog. I never knew I could lose so much so quickly. Theirs so many times I wish I had kept pushing through and stayed at that job because of the money I made there. The thing with this story is is that part of it was meant to be. Now I know that sounds crazy but my friends later went to that surgeon and their results weren't good and they ended up seuing the surgeon because she did bad. They had to go get their surgery fixed and no I did not get the money back that I paid for the consultation or pre appointment. I spent that money for pretty much nothing. I've decided since then to not rely so much on insurance and to save and pay out of pocket. I've also decided that if I ever get a nice house and a good job like that again that I will keep working no matter how hard things get because when I fell into that depression I lost my job, money, my house, and my dog. If I had stayed at that job I could've had surgery by now. Things don't always work out, don't get your hopes up. I didn't know a surgeon would tell me everything's good just for things to fall apart. I'm not getting my hopes up until I look down and see the chest I've wanted for years. I will get that job back and I will stay until I have the surgeries I dream about every night. Things get hard, it was hard losing people at that job and going in every night and seeing that they aren't on my team anymore cause their gone. It was hard looking across the room to not see that smile from the beautiful lady I worked with that would tease me and talk about her life growing up. Working grave was hard, losing co workers was hard, losing my great grandma was hard, balancing life with work was hard, getting my hopes up for all I wanted for that to not happen was hard, leaving someone toxic for her to break into my house to try to get me kicked out and for her to harass me over the phone and contact my family and bother them was hard, giving my dog that I raised to a friend was hard, leaving my house to move into a small apartment with a friend was hard, being broke and working a job that doesn't pay as well was hard, leaving behind most of my items because I couldn't fit them was hard. But I'm still here, I'm still trying and yes it's hard but I wake up everyday and I go to work, I wake up everyday wishing I still had alot of those things (except for the ex screw her). Things get tough, things get depressing but I'm still here and I believe that if I can go through that (which is only a little piece of what I've been through) and still work for stuff and be here then I believe that any of you can do it too. If you need me message me, if you want to hear more, message me, if your stuck or down, message me because I'm still here.	"You are still alive and still fighting. That‚Äôs the important part, that‚Äôs what makes you strong and courageous. I‚Äôm sorry you had to go through all that but the important part is the we never stop fighting for what we believe in. 

I‚Äôve been through my own personal hell years ago and again recently but as long as we keep going we can accomplish our goals.
You are doing the right thing.  I lost my first chance at surgery and almost died, but coming back stronger is the only way forward. 

Usually what happens in this case is the surgeon did not write a strong letter/do the necessary calls in support of your surgery.  Definitely find someone else.  Hopefully insurance will still cover it.  I found a ton of resources on Facebook for finding alternate doctors compared the one I had planned.  Also, ask your pcp / T provider.  The guy who ended up doing mine wasn‚Äôt even advertising at the time I got signed up.

Keep going.  You can do it ‚úä
Insurance will make you work for it, don't give up.  Get the letters redone and get a letter from a counselor and one from a counselor/therapist/psychologist that has ""Dr"" in their title.  I was denied for a surgery like you but went and got exactly what the insurance wanted and made sure the people I was getting the letters from knew about the denial and what is needed.  It delayed me 2 months but I got approved and had the surgery.
Oh wow what a journey!
Awww...try not to get down.

Sometimes life can give setbacks but I try to focus on the general direction of your life and now for sure that you are on the path that makes you happy and loads of people support you :) it'll happen
I‚Äôm taking my brother to have his first consultation on the 11th. He has the same insurance and is terrified something will go wrong. 

Did they ever end up telling you why the insurance suddenly didn‚Äôt accept it? I‚Äôve called them to make sure, months ago and they said they did.

Either way, keep being strong! I‚Äôm so very impressed and proud! I know how difficult it is for my brother just to leave our house because of his dysphoria, so the fact that you did all that you did, and all that you‚Äôre doing, is amazing. üíú
For sure, thank you so much! I'm happy that your still here! I hope we can all knock out some big goals in life. We got this
Aweh thank you so much! This is very helpful, I appreciate it
Oh shit, I will definitely try that, thank you so much!
I'm honestly not sure but part of me thinks it's because it was through my dad's work company idk. I hope it works out, it's definitely nerve wrecking. Thank you so much, that's very sweet of you, I appreciate it!

Law suit against states banning transitioning past the age of 18?	Hi! The situation in some conservative states is starting to worry me due to bills like the one mentioned in [this link.](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&cd=&ved=2ahUKEwj23-OPmeH8AhXmZzABHVAXCuoQFnoECBIQAQ&url=https%3A%2F%2Fabcnews.go.com%2Famp%2FUS%2Fnew-bill-ban-gender-confirming-care-26-oklahoma%2Fstory%3Fid%3D96261603&usg=AOvVaw1XciAFklWwrIhdTK2oUWAn), and I was wondering if when/if they pass (but they probably will), would it be possible for people to sue those states because being able to transition once you‚Äôve become 18 might (and definitely should) be protected under the 1st Amendment as it would be infringing on our rights to free speech. It might be a stretch though. Which also brings up the topic of that ‚ÄúRight to Free Speech‚Äù should be changed to something along the lines of ‚ÄúRight to Free Speech and Expression‚Äù or something like that.	"Yes, you can sue. The ACLU is working with four minors in Arkansas and their families who are suing the state. Their efforts have resulted in a ruling that temporarily banned the ban so their care has been able to continue for now. The case is Brandt vs. Rutledge if you want an example. The situation is terrifying and is  getting more and more extreme. Just know some states are also passing safe haven laws to protect trans rights. Washington and Illinois are the most recent. But you should not have to flee your state for your right to medical care.
Unfortunately, all these bills are popping up because SCOTUS shot down RvW and basically said that body autonomy isn't a federal constitutional right.

At this point I don't know what *legal* recourse we have left except not voting for dipshits... But we've seen how that works out.
Legal doesn‚Äôt mean shit, if it‚Äôs morally wrong we all need to actually ban together and organize ourselves as a population against it, but it‚Äôs hard to do that because there‚Äôs this sceme governments have been putting together and implementing where they make as many different communities of people and then feed them all propaganda about how they‚Äôre the most correct community and that all others are worse and need to go.  So now everyones fighting themselves and there will never be one group big enough to actually overthrow and re-establish a new system.  Also doesn‚Äôt help that they keep the largest and most problematic communities (the conservatives and the christians) as close them and on their side as they can so that if any community opposes the gov then they have all their resources to stop them PLUS the backing of two major communities in society.
I don't live in the states but it makes me really sad to see all these laws they're trying to pass to make our lives harder. Stay strong out there everyone!
It can and will be challenged under multiple clauses.  (also, members of [TST](https://thesatanictemple.com/pages/faq) will be able to make claims of religious freedom).  These bills aren't meant to stand up in court.  They are meant to whip up their base for the next election without having to do anything of real substance.  The average person has no idea how the economy actually works so any gains in that area would be relatively meaningless or, worse, get attributed to the opposition.  Far easier to pass a bill based on fear, that will get struck down in the courts, so that they can claim conspiracy and increase fear to get new votes.  Once they have milked us for all we can get them, they'll move on to the next best target.  They don't actually want to ""fix"" anything because then people will start looking to closely at what they are doing behind the scenes.  Which really isn't all that much or surprising,  they are just doing whatever gets them the most value (for whatever it is they value).
I heard that laws could be overturned if there‚Äôs enough signatures or something? Is there a petition? If yes link it here please.
I wanna cry. I waited until I was 18 to come out to my family because I was afraid that laws targeting trans kids would be made, but now they aren‚Äôt satisfied with ‚Äúkeeping the children safe‚Äù! I hate them. Why do they hate us? What did we do wrong? What next? I‚Äôm scared. It looks like things are only getting worse. I wish I didn‚Äôt exist.

it would be cool if america functioned on logic instead of a 250 year old piece of paper that's worshipped as a divine artifact
You could probably make a Freedom of Expression argument here, but it would also be good to look at other rights relating to privacy and autonomy.

The courts have recognized a right to *refuse* medical care, though I don't know of cases which have specifically recognized a corresponding right to *obtain* to care. To me it seems reasonable that if you have the right to refuse something, you must also have the right to seek it.
Not even mentioning ones right to happiness and health. I would say this seems to be number one reason to sue, like if it is hampering your presuit of happiness. And what of liberty? It isn't like trans is a threat to anyone, why ban it. You'd have to have some kind of erroneous take on gender to ban gender affirming care. Like what of the 34-62 million people world wide who are intersex, or chimera, or some mosaic system? They are even represented in a ban like this because the system doesn't even try to type their sex let alone gender. This fucking country is a joke right now and has been for far too long. How dare we say we are the land of the free. With as much systemic hate how could anyone live free here?
Good!
I think we need to learn from the French sometimes
To an extent, you are right, but these laws blatantly go against the 14th amendment, and there aren't any fetuses to argue that they also have bodily autonomy to use, like with RvW. That was the reason RvW was able to be undone. The Supreme Court believed that fetuses have bodily autonomy. With these, however, it's just straightforward.
The problem is that legality is what matters in the eyes of the people who can do something about it.
I do live in the states. It‚Äôs not safe.
This reminds me that I need to join TST and help them fight here in Oklahoma.

We didn‚Äôt do anything wrong - they are fascists and are cowards.  Yes, what they are  doing is scary.  One reason they target us is because we are authentic and are able to think for ourselves and be who we truly are despite all they throw at us. Our sense of self threatens people who are insecure.  Please hold on, as there are many of us out here in the world- there always have been and always will be. We are glad you are here and the world is better with you in it.
I know. It‚Äôs like what did we ever do to them? Hopefully you‚Äôre not in the states or a place where they are passing these laws. Stay strong. I know you can get through it. One day we will get our rights back everywhere.

Exactly! If we root ourselves in a scientific understanding of the world, we can replace the current system, which has long outlived its progressive role, with a new one that can redefine the structure of society that allows an end to the gender binary. An equal basis for all people. 

The action is only half the battle, it‚Äôs gonna require study.
From personal experience, building the labor movement is a pretty decent start.

And building political power off of the labor movement and any pro-LGBT organizations would be the next part.

We gotta get out of this mindset of just voting and electoral politics, we need to permanently suppress our oppressors, and that means taking these mechanisms of power and leveraging them to build a revolutionary movement.
I wouldn‚Äôt say getting rid of the gender binary is exactly the way to go, I‚Äôd say more getting rid of oppressive gender norms and gendered expectations and creating a system that‚Äôs more open to things outside of the gender binary while not full on getting rid of it would be better imo
I see where you‚Äôre coming from! The point I‚Äôm making is that there isn‚Äôt a gender binary at all, and a system that allows for genders that aren‚Äôt man and woman would have to acknowledge that, they‚Äôre the majority but not the default, ya know?

A system that accepts genders outside of the currently accepted binary is a system that rejects that binary by its function.
Ohhhh yeah I think I see what you mean, because if we had that kind of system in the first place I‚Äôm doubtful we‚Äôd have a gender binary at all, there‚Äôd just be people of any number of genders. Yeah I definitely agree, I think I misunderstood you the first time lol, sorry
No you‚Äôre good! I could talk about this all day. Lol
That‚Äôs fair, I personally haven‚Äôt given it much thought but it definitely is interesting to think about c:

"Anyone else feel weird when someone just calls you ""a trans""?"

I did ask them to use ""trans person/people instead without much resistance which was great but it's not the first time it's happened and every time someone does that it irks me the wrong way. ""Those trans"" ""that trans"" ""the transes"" all the time. Like, say you replaced trans by black and to me the problem becomes obvious but idk ig people have trouble seeing it.

i said ‚Äúif you say that again i will not hesitate to shove my foot up your ass and wear you like a boot. we arent fucking pok√©mon.‚Äù and walked away.
yea that seems pretty phobic
I don't know about french but in spanish using an adjective as a noun isn't really offensive. It's just grammar. But when it's in english it's usually a bad idea, unless it's something that we've reclaimed, like ""a queer"". But I haven't heard anyone voluntarily reclaim ""a trans"" before.
I kid you not one of the people leading a diversity and inclusion seminar for my company literally just did this 30 mins ago (not me specifically but referring to the individual in a case study)

Tennessee GOP leader threatens to raise taxes on companies that spoke out against anti-LGBT ‚Äòbathroom bill‚Äô		"I don't think you can legally raise taxes on a specific company. There may be a way to put forth a tax that hurts them more than others though (like if it was a bunch of furniture companies and you put forth a tax on furniture sales).
So, this officially proves we're in a modern day version of the 30s and 40s Russia and Germany. 

Discrimination laws worded to separate into a unique class, check. LGBT are the new Romani

Minority group mass hate, check. Muslims are the Jew. As a German-American, I feel sick.

The list goes on, and it's only a matter of time before work will bring us *fags* freedom, and God will be be with us, and our pink and blue triangles.

I keep hearing how this is unconstitutional, but I see no action being made to halt the passing if these asinine homages to the Gulags. 

I guess he wants to give people even less of a reason to visit Tennessee.

I swear, the southern states are having a race to see who can collapse the quickest. 
Seriously, I know it's a low-hanging fruit, but I feel like this is a great example of ""Do you not THINK before you speak?  How exactly do you plan to do that?""
Simple; You target these businesses with ""random"" regulatory inspections at a more frequent rate than others. Every business has some small infraction that can be fined to some degree.
As an Asian American I wholeheartedly agree. It's hard for people who were outside of an event to really resonate with correlations. It seems so silly to the average white American. Clearly we're not Nazi's, this is Murica. But from someone whose family was the correct squinty eye to stay out of ""internment"" camps I've seen the same writing on the wall for a long time. Most Americans fail to realize we were small steps away from doing the same thing we were condemning in WWII. And now all the same beginning steps and statements are being made.  
  
It's also why I'll never forfeit my guns. I won't go quietly into that sweet night. 
I know it doesn't seen like it now, but things are getting better. And at this rate, our grandkids are going to live in a utopia compared to us. It's counter intuitive but all these anti-trans laws are actually evidence of things improving. Ten years ago there were no laws because anti-trans parties didn't think they needed them. Society did a good enough job keeping us down that they didn't think they needed to get Johnny Law involved. But now that acceptance is growing they're desperate. These laws won't hold water. As soon as it gets taken before the supreme court they'll fall. But because of our legal system that takes time.

Imagine two people with cancer. One is getting treatment while the other is ignoring it. The one getting chemo will look and feel much worse but is getting better. Our society is getting chemo right now. It's hard, it sucks, but it will get better. We just have to be diligent and patient. In the meantime, keep working at it. Vote in EVERY election especially local ones.
Yes, but that isn't a tax.
> correct squinty eye to stay out of ""internment"" camps   

I think my spoons just spilled onto the floor. That's an awful thing to hear, especially with it being history. 

We really are, with these ""Religious Bills"" and the now blatant and open government corruption. We're slipping down a dark, deep hole. That will not end well this time.

True, but they may have to hire more attorneys due to the more frequent audits = more wasted $ and hours.
Maybe not technically, but practically and effectively it is.
Well if you remember the ""know your neighbor"" poster campaigns they racially profiled how to figure out the ""chinks from the Japs"" so that only the right ones were sent to suffer and lose their property.  
  
And unfortunately even in this day and age I'm reminded how separate I am from the ""average white person"" let alone now that I'm trans. It's seriously going to take some horrific times to get to ""equality"" even though it's 2016 and shouldn't be an issue.

The recent anti-trans laws in America scare the hell out of me and I don't know what to do	"It seems like every day there's another fucking bill proposed to take rights away from trans people. Wtf, ""genitalia exams"" for kids in florida??? Making it a felony to support your child if they're trans? What the fuck? And it's all under the guise of protecting children, when it will do the exact opposite of that to both trans and cis children. 

I don't know what to do. I don't feel like anyone cares about us or will listen."	"I've been feeling this too. 

I've been trying to talk to my friends and family and explain these terrible hate laws. Some of them I've gotten to call or email governors of states like when Arkansas was kicking off the anti trans laws. I am making some educational writings to share to develop more understanding, empathy, and healthy knowledge. - I worry about political misinformation and twrf style rhetoric confusing or weakening ally support.

But most times I'm not quite sure what to do outside of attempt to drum up support on social media, have good discussions with your peers/family a about trans issues, and keep contacting your states representatives.

URGENT: we need your help banning conversion therapy in NZ!!!	"It will only take 5 minutes of your time but we urgently need more submissions. Conservative opposition groups have submitted in large numbers against the ban and without enough submissions in support of the ban the bill will likely be weakened to not extend religious groups and parents (basically not a ban). ANYONE CAN MAKE A SUBMISSION!!!

Here is a links to templates and all the relevant info is included : [https://linktr.ee/Shaneellall](https://linktr.ee/Shaneellall)"	"Is my info all private on this? Or will my name be public? I'd love to make a submission, but I'm also concerned about using my preferred name, since I'm not fully public.
Help... I keep reading this wrong... Someone pls simplify the meaning of this!
Done and Did.
Your name will be public but nothing else so theoretically I don't think people could identify you... 

There is also a way to email them and ask about submitting privately, although i'm not too sure how it works.
The NZ Parliament has a bill on banning conversion therapy and it will most likely pass.

HOWEVER this is the stage where they decide on the details of the bill, and listen to public opinion. If too many people are against it they will likely weaken the bill so parents and religious people may practice conversion therapy, at which point it is not a ban.

You can make a submission using one of the templates linked in the post and it contains all the relevant info
Thank you!
Conversion therapy is transitioning? Or such
as in trying to make gay people straight/forcing trans people to be the gender they are assigned at birth- this bill should make these things illegal

if someone can offer a better explanation please do
I don't understand what they're saying... This is too confusing and complex for me... Still no clue what any of this is actually supposed to mean....
So conversion therapy = bad ?? And that's why it should be banned?? Do I get that right now?
from wikipedia:  


Conversion therapy is the pseudoscientific practice of trying to change an individual's sexual orientation from homosexual or bisexual to heterosexual  
 using psychological, physical, or spiritual interventions. There is no   
reliable evidence that sexual orientation can be changed, and medical   
institutions warn that conversion therapy practices are ineffective and   
potentially harmful."	pee16o	trans	31	0.96	2021-08-30 08:37:52

 ""It's irresponsible for anybody in health care to provide or recommend life-altering surgeries that may later be regretted,"" said Olsen, a Republican.

How do I even deal with this new law?	The state I live in, Oklahoma, is about to pass a bill that will force anyone under the age of 26 to detransition, as well as make it a felony to receive gender affirming care for anyone under 26. How the hell do I even deal with this? I'm not exactly in a position to move right now, so that isn't really an option. This might be the first time I've been genuinely afraid of being myself, and I have no idea what to do. Does anyone have any advice?	"Is this even constitutial? I don't know about how LGBTQ is seen by the US constitution at all. In any case if you aren't in a position to move to a more trans friendly state the only thing you can do is oppose the new law. I read that in other states similar things are being handled in court as we speak. Of course only a single person won't win against the government but try to look for others who are talking about this.
All transfolk, even in the safe states need to be networking and making exit plans.  Get your passport.  This is just testing the waters.
Wait, WTF? I look away from the news for 2 days and they pull this shit? I know moving might not be an option but, if you can, move. Escape.
do you have a plan to get out? even one that's not feasible yet? any place to go?

i dont know that this will pass or be enforced but you probably need to work that direction
I would honestly work towards being able to move away. Finish whatever business / education you have to finish there, and then leave
Even if it doesn‚Äôt pass, that‚Äôs a garbage state and you should be making every effort to be getting out of it. I know that doesn‚Äôt help you or many others short term, but it‚Äôs the reality.
Part of the reason I moved to New Mexico is it is liberal state. Santa Fe is about 40some odd % LGBTQ and I am learning there are apparently a lot of trans here!
Hi! I‚Äôm dealing with the same thing right now, and I know it seems bleak but we have options. Like the others in this thread are saying, it MIGHT get struck down, but I personally am not super confident in our government to do the right thing, so here are a couple of options:

1. Telehealth. Find a doctor outside of OK that offers telehealth, and get your care and prescriptions from them (ideally you can have a friend or family member mail your medications, depending on whether this law hits local pharmacies too). The only thing you would be missing out on doing it remotely is blood testing to check your levels, which is important but we CAN live without it, or find a local place to do it (blood testing shouldn‚Äôt be affected).

2. There is a good website for obtaining these medications, ahem, extralegally. Again, you‚Äôd be on your own for testing your levels, but I‚Äôve been keeping my eye on this for when the government starts to crack down on us like this. I don‚Äôt know if I‚Äôm allowed to post a link here, but DM me if you aren‚Äôt aware of this site already. 

I hope this helps! This is a hard situation for us, but we can and will make it through this. üíô
I'm sorry to hear you may be affected by this callous and clearly unconstitutional abuse of legislative authority.

Knowledge is power. One way to stay informed about the issue would be to go to the 2023 Legislative Preview that ACLU OK is holding: [https://www.acluok.org/en/events/2023-legislative-preview](https://www.acluok.org/en/events/2023-legislative-preview)

Another would be to get familiar with what the bill says so you know how best to fight it for your situation and to alleviate unnecessary stress and alarm. [https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314](https://legiscan.com/OK/text/SB129/id/2623314)

To be clear the bill has been introduced, but any legislator can do that. We don't yet know how it will fare, or what potential legal challenges will be posed if it were to pass, and I'm sure there will be a significant battle fought by ACLU in that case and they might be able to stay the decision. Especially given that it is medically negligent to suddenly stop hormonal therapy.

From what I can tell the bill itself does not mandate detransitioning, but would take away gender-affirming care for those under age 26. I know that's not much consolation and maybe drawing a distinction where there is none for some folks, but I just want to encourage getting really precise about what it is they are trying to do, so we can fight it!
I'm also in OK and yeah it's scary here. Luckily this time I'm over 26 but this is just the beginning if they get their way and that's what is really terrifying.
Jesus Christ that‚Äôs insane. What are our lawmakers thinking?
Get the fuck out and pray. Or pray that lightning strikes the lawmakers before the law passes. If only we could control lightning...
So terrible to hear about such intolerance.  I know this is not a great answer, but you would be welcome in Connecticut.  I don't like suggesting to someone that they leave their home, but if anyone is thinking about it I just want you to know you're welcome here.
This all sucks, but I can't see this lasting very long. Laws that restrict people's rights have a tendency to backfire on the people pushing them as people who are being restricted, decide to get together and do something about it. We are already seeing our Supreme Court loose it's legitimacy in the eyes of the public, but we aren't talking about it yet because action hasn't been made. 

I'd say to get angry, and use that anger to fuel you into acting against this in the ways that you can. Because people's lives are LITTERALLY on the line. 

Plus, enforcing this law is just gonna be a headache and could easily cause a dangerous situation for the states leaders. If doctors all come together in the state and say no, what is the state gonna do? Imprison all their doctors? That's definitely a smart idea /s.
Doesn't Plume offer HRT that you can use? That's who I currently use. They're great.
I'm so sorry. I don't know if you can if it passes. I'd consider moving, if I were there I'd personally leave.
In the U.S things generally boil down to ""no one has taken it to court yet, so it's not- not constitutional""

Someone is going to have to take it to the supreme court before its determined for sure one way or the other.
I do have a plan, although it isn't very feasible currently. There is a career I am interested in pursuing in a more trans friendly state, but I need to save more money before moving would be possible, and unfortunately that is going to take some time.
Yep we are bottom of the barrel in pretty much every metric.
Thank you, I'll keep that in mind. I've always wanted to live in the desert, it is the most beautiful biome imo. And now that I think about it, New Mexico is not too far from where I live currently, relatively speaking, so it shouldn't be \*too\* difficult to stay in contact with my friends and family that still live here, which is a huge plus for me.
Been looking into option 2 myself, as a backup plan. I suspect I know what you‚Äôre talking about but not sure on a few things.
I get it. Sadly your conservative af Supreme Court would probably not budge. I mean, aren't they the same that nullified the national abortion bill?
I wouldn‚Äôt be too surprised if a judge at a lower level blocks the law from going into effect before there‚Äôs a ruling on it. But maybe I have too much optimism for the US court system.
And the inters are mild and we have fantastic food! Lol
It was a landmark ruling making abortion legal in the US and yeah they struck it down
Likely, yes.

I can't see them actively supporting trans rights. 

Sadly, The best outcome I could see realistically is the exact same thing as our abortion bill. They basically say the constitution doesn't take a stance one way or the other and leave it to the states.

A lot of people would be screwed sideways, but at least the feds couldn't pressure places that are safe now to be any less safe in the future. 

That's little comfort for anyone in OP's situation, but it's the best we can hope for, at least for now.

Honestly just an awful time to live in America :/
There are judges who will do that. I just wonder if there is any judge in Oklahoma who will do this. Cause right now in the US, the lower courts have been a lot less partisan than the higher ones."	105i0q9	trans	28	0.9	2023-01-07 06:29:29

I got into an argument with my Mom about trans people	"Tw: Transphobia, Suicide, swearing

~~~

it started with me bringing up the new texas bill and how fucked up it is. she of course said shit like ""if you are born a girl, you are a girl. saying you aren't is saying god made a mistake"". 

well, eventually i said something along the lines of ""well for a lot of people (specifically referring to ftm people) when they get called she/her and the name they were given at birth it makes them want to kill themselves. wouldn't it be better to respect them and call them what they want so we don't hurt them even more?""

after a bit of arguing about this she said something along the lines of ""if you think you are something you aren't that bad, you need to turn to god so he can give your life purpose and heal you from those beliefs"".

i started crying and went upstairs.

i fucking hate this house and myself. why couldn't i just be born a fucking boy? why can't my parents just  see how much their words hurt? im not even out yet but i know they wouldn't support me. they would tell me ""you were born a girl. you aren't a boy"". it just hurts so freaking much. when they tell me ""oh i love you no matter what"" and yet they wouldn't love the me that i truly am.

fuck them."	"All the advice that I can give you is that it will get better and you will find people that accept you. IMO do not come out until you are safe and away from your parents if you think that they will hurt you. I know it will hurt but it will get better and your future friends and chosen family are going to be so excited to meet the real you.

üò≠	I am being abused by my dad I am a Trans non-binary men and I want to get away from my dad but I don't know how I live in Warner Oklahoma I have tried multiple times to call the police on him but every time I do they just take me back to him I don't want to be here anymore but I'm afraid to leave because I don't know how to be a adult he never taught me how do sayings pay taxes pay the rent a job pay the electric bill so I don't know how to be on my own but I can't be in this abusive relationship anymore I wish somebody anybody could help me I'm kind of hoping that somebody will see this post and can help me	"I‚Äôm sorry I can‚Äôt help you physically. But I might be able to talk some sense. 

The most important thing is that you are safe. If that means getting out of there then do that. You‚Äôll learn all the stuff you need to know on the way. 

I would advise learning as much as you can from the internet. Location of lgtbq friendly shelters in your area for instance, or just simple things like how to do taxes, how to save money, etc. 

You might not be able to leave right now but that does not mean you can‚Äôt work towards that goal, all be it in secret. Start with identifying the things you‚Äôll need to do to get a somewhat stable start once you‚Äôre out.
Start working and planning towards that goal. 

If you are able, and only if you‚Äôre certain it doesn‚Äôt put your safety at risk, gather evidence of his abuse. 
Take pictures of bruises, write down what he does, why and when. (Time and date may prove useful) 

Once you‚Äôre out I‚Äôd highly recommend going to a trans friendly shelter, or a human rights oriented shelter. They‚Äôll have people that can protect you legally speaking. You might also want to get a lawyer, if you‚Äôre planning on confronting him. Someone with legal knowledge could very well be able to keep you out of his grasp once you‚Äôre out. A trans friendly or human rights oriented group might be able to provide one. Hence the importance of finding one and going to them.

This is all for the future tho. Please remember that no matter how bad it gets, you owe it to your future self to stay alive. Suicide is never the answer. If you do that your dad wins. Never let that happen. Ever. 

The most important thing right now is to focus on making the tiny first steps to freedom. I don‚Äôt know if you have a job or a means of income but if you do putting away little bits of money at a time might amass enough to get you started. 

If you don‚Äôt have acces to money, or your dad checks your accounts, those trans friendly shelters are your best bet. Even if it‚Äôs in a different state, it‚Äôs worth making your escape. 

You‚Äôre 21. You‚Äôre a legal adult and you can‚Äôt be detained by your dad. It‚Äôs against the law. If you choose to go no-one can stop you. Don‚Äôt make a scene tho. Do it quietly. Hitchhike, or use any other means to get where you need to go. But get as far away as fast as you can once you‚Äôre out. Maybe even a different country. At least a different state. Preferably a more trans friendly one.

I do reiterate that for now, the coming weeks, it‚Äôs important to stay calm. Cary on as usual but collect evidence of his abuse (only of it doesn‚Äôt endanger you) Quietly work towards your goal, start gathering information and recourses. If you have any friends you can trust talk to them, but only if you‚Äôre sure it won‚Äôt get back to your dad. Once again, for now, stay calm and collected, no matter how hard it is. Be quietly assured that your getting out. At some point. You‚Äôre gonna get out. Rest assured in that knowledge. 


One more thing. When you‚Äôre out and hopefully living your best life, somewhere far away, and he tries to contact you, do it only on your terms. Talk to a therapist, or a psychiatrist, get someone to guide you. A certified someone I may add. It‚Äôs fairly common abusive parents try to regain contact. If you let it go on his terms, it‚Äôs gonna go back to the way it was. Always on your terms. Remember that. You don‚Äôt owe him anything. 

Good luck. If and when your out, and when you are able, update us. 

Stay safe, stay vigilant. It‚Äôs almost over.
Have you tried calling CPS?
Okay. You've identified the problem, that's a great first step! You need to get away from your dad. And you lack the basic set of core skills to achieve launch. So take it one problem at a time, and ask for help from experts along the way. YouTube videos exist for literally everything you can think of that needs fixing. Break your problem down into smaller chunks. Certainly that will work for paying your taxes, and if you can't figure it out, that's what the tax prep services are for, it won't be that hard/expensive to figure out your tax situation. If you just walk into a bank, or better, I would suggest a Credit Union, they can help you setup a new account there. But perhaps you don't want an account at a bank in Warner, OK if you don't intend to stay there. The big national banks like Wells Fargo or U.S. Bank suck, but they have national reach so if you wind up in New York or Minneapolis or California or whatever, you'll be able to find bank branches there so if you have a job now and want to start putting your paychecks in an account only you can access, that's a good move. If you need to setup an account with a power company, phone company, insurance company, etc they're all on the web where you can either fill out a form or they'll have a Customer Service phone number you can call to establish an account. If he cuts off your phone, go into a T-Mobile or a Verizon or AT&T store and establish your own phone line and pay it off that new checking account. The most important thing to do at this point is to secure yourself and your papers, and your money. Get your Birth Certificate and Social Security card from him or from his files, and if you can't find it there, you can get a new birth certificate from a County Clerk of Court or Deputy Registrar's office in the state you were born in, contact your local Courthouse. A copy of your Social Security card can be obtained from your local Social Security office, and I think there might even be a way to do that by mail or online. Do you have a driver's license or state ID? You'll need those three things to establish bank accounts, sign for loans, transition your name/gender legally, etc, so try to get that stuff before you go, it's a lot easier to do it now but it's not impossible to replace that stuff if you have to leave it behind. It's a just a pain in the ass so get your ID docs if you can. Do you have a car? Get one. Get a van, if you can, that you can haul all your stuff with you wherever you go, and sleep in until you sort out a better plan and land somewhere safe. If you have to leave with just the clothes on your back right now, these are all problems you can figure out as they actually manifest and you don't need to worry about all that all at once. If you can ride it out for a little while, sell as much of your old stuff and gather as much cash as you can get your hands on first. Cash is king. The problems you can solve with money, solve them with money. Not every problem can be solved with money but many of them can, and focus on those first. Then you just have to focus on finding some money, which is a different but solvable problem!
well I'll be honest idk if I can help really. but I am pretty good at figuring things out. so if you want to, you  can dm me and I'll see what I can do.
YouTube is your friend. You should find someone else you can room mate with and work together to figure out taking care of each other and paying the rent. It's tough but you'll make it just keep swimming
First you need to get out and to do that you need money. Apply for crappy jobs: retail, fast food, gas stations, whatever you can do to save up and move out. Do you have credit? In our (very busted) world, you're gonna need it. Once you have a job and have been working a bit, apply for a starter credit card and use it *only* for small stuff. Need gas or food before pay day? Use the card and *pay it off as soon as you get paid*; that'll build your credit. Research apartments near your job, cheaper apartments are gonna suck and pet rent is a thing. Figure out your budget. How much are you making? How much does an apartment cost? Average electric bill? Utilities? Gas or other transit to work? Don't forget to budget for food.

Depending on how trans friendly your area is, roommates might be a good option, there are websites for that. The other good thing about living with roommates is they might have some of the skills you don't. Youtube is also a good place on how to do stuff. The channel, 'mom how do I?' focuses on stuff you would've learned in home economics class (if public education didn't suck so bad): cooking, how to sew a button on a shirt, how to use an iron and there's a 'dad, how do I?' one for stuff like changing your car's oil and checking tire pressure."	w8ffd6	trans	30	0.9	2022-07-26 09:40:44
I think I might be trans but can‚Äôt really articulate why	"Hi all, confused person here (20 years old). Looking for a little guidance. 

I never questioned my gender until about 6 months ago. I literally never considered it. But after leaving the all-boys secondary school I attended and now being in university living with and mostly associating with women, I‚Äôve been assaulted by the thought that I want to be a girl almost constantly. I don‚Äôt really know what it is that I want: I can‚Äôt tell if I hate being a guy for example. When I look at myself in the mirror I‚Äôm not exactly overcome with horror or anything but I find it a little bit hard to really like what I‚Äôm seeing. Like, if someone looked like me I‚Äôd think they were fairly attractive. But for me theres something ‚Äúoff‚Äù. Maybe, I‚Äôm not sure. 

Similarly, I have an abstract idea that I‚Äôd love to wear traditionally feminine clothing, but I always default to very anonymous generic masc clothing because I don‚Äôt really feel like I know where to start. I know I‚Äôm bi, but whenever I imagine myself being in a relationship with a woman I think of us as lesbians (if that makes sense). My feelings towards both men and women are gay, somehow. Sorry if that‚Äôs a stupid thing to say. 

I think a lot of these thoughts first came about when I started following a bunch of trans women on Twitter. I felt like I was approaching something I needed when I spectated them, if that makes sense. Like they where on a path in life I also wanted to be on. 

All this said, I don‚Äôt feel like I really fully fit the bill for being a trans woman. I don‚Äôt think of myself as a woman (not now anyway) and I‚Äôm still not sure if a lot of this is a brief phase that‚Äôs come about just because I‚Äôm experiencing a lot of new things after having moved away from my parents. 

Anyway, that‚Äôs all I wanted to say. Sorry if this post wasn‚Äôt appropriate for this sub or was massively missing the point. But I thank you for your thoughts in advance. 

"	"Hey! It's so so great that you are thinking more about your gender identity. This can be a rocky road, but hopefully you find a greater sense of self and happiness.

See if you can find a therapist who specializes in helping trans people/people dealing with gender identity issues. I found mine through my local LGBT center website and I love them. They will be very helpful of diving in deeply into your feelings. Especially the ""I don't know if I'm really trans or just want to wear women's clothes."" I know for me I was unsure about whether or not I was trans or gender non-conforming or whatever. I found my feelings and understanding got more intense the more that I was unpacking them and actually verbalizing my thoughts.

From what I've seen: most cis men don't spend their time thinking ""I'd rather be a woman"" or ""my life would be better as a woman."" Most cis people don't give their gender a second thought. They take it as a given and like it's ""natural"" to identify as the gender they're assigned at birth. It might not be you're trans, but if you feel deeply uncomfortable with being a man, there might be something there. 

Good luck!
Heyo. First of all, I'd like to welcome. So to start off, you do give off a fair few signs, actually. Wanting to dress more traditionally feminine, seeing yourself as a lesbian, feeling like you want to be a woman, to name a few.

You could very well be trans, though only you can come to that conclusion. Gender identity, as the name implies, is subjective in a lot of ways. What you see as feminine won't be universally seen as feminine. It's ok to ""not be like every other trans person,"" because we're all different anyways.

Before coming out not all trans women hate their bodies, see themselves as women, have serious mental problems, or dress as women. Some people are okay with things as they are, but know they would be happier with a different gender label (be it non-binary, trans woman/man, Gender fluid, etc.). Being cis just doesn't feel like it's authentic. This may cause you pain, it may not. Either case is valid.

There are a couple of things you can do from here. A few being talk to a gender therapist, go to an lgbt center for resources, and sit in on a transgender group (you don't have to talk if you don't feel comfortable). If you want to try something more direct, you could start by trying on some women's clothes. Thrift shops are a great place to look for cheap clothes. Get some girl jeans or a skirt(better if you can't tuck), a girly t-shirt, maybe a bra/breast form, and see how you like it. If you do like it, explore a little more. Try getting your nails done (fingers if your brave, toes if your classy =3), wear some simple makeup (mascara isn't too noticeable, but can produces some surprising results on it's own), play some female avatars in a game.

Whatever you decide to do, I wish you luck. You deserve to be both happy and comfortable with your body. And of course, please pop in and chat again (check out some of the other trans subreddits, I'll post a few as an edit once I'm off mobile)

edit: r/traaaaaaannnnnnnnnns (trans meme's for days), r/transadorable (cute photos of trans folks), TransSupport (not super active, but a good place to go if you need help), r/asktransgender (the actual_lesbians of trans subs), and r/ask_transgender (a great place to ask trans related questions).

This is almost exactly me
makes a lot of sense and fits the bill not too badly

imagining myself as a lesbian was what started to crack my shell, 

 i know how horrible dysphoria is for some (the recurring image of the mirror with some horror in it that you might be thinking of) but it can also take form as apathy or unease, which can be just as bad but actually doesn't have to be

every trans person has a different experience of being trans, so the question ""am i trans"" is super hard to answer, even for me now, so when i doubt myself i just ask ""am i a woman?"" and since the answer is yes, i guess i must be trans.
I was like you for 32 years. I'm transitioning now and SO happy. Life just makes sense.  It sounds like gender dysphoria you're describing. Its confusing isn't it?  Imagine being a man, and not at all feminine for your life...and imagine being a woman..beautiful hair, soft skin, feminine shape, breasts, etc...how does each make you feel?
You make a lot of good points! Would you say that seeing a therapist would be the best first step for me?
> play some female avatars in a game.

Funny you should say that, I do this a lot actually. I play D&D a lot and I usually play as a female character. My first two characters were men, then my third was a woman, and then I just kept playing as women. I keep meaning to make a male character, but I always end up settling on playing as a woman. I feel like it's a really safe space to be more feminine because everyone at the table expects me to be playing as someone who isn't me. If I turned up one day wearing women's clothing or makeup I'd probably get scrutinised and questioned, but if I boldly declare I am a half-orc pirate woman no one bats an eyelid.

EDIT: thank you for the sub suggestions, I'll check them out!
> Your egg is cracking. She's ready to hatch.

When you put it like that, it sounds really scary lol

I'll try to live my truth tho, I've been aware that I haven't really been true to myself for maybe even longer than I've been thinking about my gender identity.
I think a therapist would be a really really great start. My therapist made me really interrogate my relationship with my gender and contemplate what I wanted. The plus side as well with a therapist is if you're in an area without any informed consent clinics they will be helpful in getting a letter for a doctor or endocrinologist IF you are interested in medically transitioning.

I know that it can be hard to get started. I had similar feelings to yours but I pushed it off for so long because I thought I wasn't trans enough. I didn't think I fit into the mold of what it meant to be trans based on just my assumptions. A GOOD therapist who specializes in working with trans people can be amazing for your mental health.
You're welcome, of course =)

And most trans girls who play games tend to gravitate towards female avatars... I remember making my first runescape character, and picking a girl because ""guys give you free stuff cus you're a girl.""

 Fast forward a few years later, and all 10 of my wow characters are girls with anime names of guys who turn into girls (ranma, hazumu) or girl versions of dudes (rioma from ranma 1/2)... I never saw the irony until after I came out and started transitioning...

Edit: actually... I never realized how ironic it was until now... on and a half years after starting hormones
So, it's a bit unusual for the first questioning to happen this 'late'. From ancedtotal evidence, it almost always is starting earlier, either from childhood, or in puberty.

BUT....

Six months is a long time, and cismen don't really do that sort of thing.

However, this makes me think something...how long have you been playing D&D and playing with female characters. I was the same (though sometimes I did play male) but my _favorite_ one was a female elf (a really attractive female elf...with large breasts...God I was SUCH AN EGG).

So.

My point is that you may have been questioning a lot longer than you think you have. Just not consciously."	8lsqyb	trans	27	0.97	2018-05-24 13:45:58
My coming out went horribly. Now I have 2 days to make a decision.	"I'm back home for the first time since coming out to my dad, and to spare the long and short of it, it did not go well. Like, *really* not well, saying that I'm ""choosing"" to be trans, God doesn't make mistakes and that he gave him a girl, not a boy, that I'm simply just being ""influenced"" by white people to be trans (because it's not as if trans people have existed in a myriad of cultures and countries for centuries outside of America, including people from Africa), and that he'll never call me by my name or see my identity as real. What's worse is that he kept saying I'm being ""selfish"" for coming out because he's been dealing with a lot of stress these past few months (hospital bills, school fees, etc.) and that me coming out has apparently been so painful for him to deal with; he admitted that he straight up cried in the days between my coming out and when I arrived at the airport. And the rotten cherry on top of it all, he had the audacity to call the coming out letter I sent to him as garbage. The document I spent over a week drafting, editing, and agonizing over, the document I poured my heart and soul into, detailing all the pain and frustration that I had kept down for nearly *5 fucking years* apparently has no more worth than a heap of trash on the side of the road. Including resources at the end for him to look at proved to be a mistake, too, because he was actually *insulted* that I included them at all because he's a doctor, he already knows *everything* he needs to about healthcare, right?

He's been keeping this from everybody in our family (if you can even call it that at this point), including my brothers, but he's not doing it because he's actually respecting my privacy like he *said* he would in his response to my email. No, he's just been too fucking embarassed by the mere idea of havinf a trans kid defiling his legacy and doesn't want anyone else to know about it...until Friday, that is.

This is where the ultimatum comes in, although perhaps I shouldn't call it that because it's really just blackmail. Either I choose my ""family"" and repress my trans-ness in order to keep a roof over my head, or I choose to embrace my identity, get kicked out and left to fend for broke myself, and my dad spreads the news to everyone, and judging by his reaction alone, I can almost guarantee that everyone else in my wack ass family will be on his side and just come bearing down on me with the insults and ridicule.

I've misjudged my dad and this whole situation so poorly. I expected there to be *some* level of pushback. I didn't expect him to accept me right away, and I thought that maybe he would just need time to eventually come around. He's typically the more rational one of my parents when it comes to conflict, so I thought that he'd approach this situation in the same way. But he didn't. He's so resistant to having a trans child under his roof that he'd rather cut me off and let me loose in the real world early as some sort of twisted ""lesson"" for being trans, as if I would *willingly* choose to be more oppressed than I already am.

This feels like such a sick fever dream. I was such an idiot for thinking he'd accept me. So far, I think coming out was one of the worst mistakes I've made in my entire life.

**TL;DR: Dad reacted poorly to me coming out as trans, tells me I have to choose between my family or being trans and risk getting kicked out.**"	"If you‚Äôre not financially dependant then leave.

Got to say, he doesn‚Äôt sound fit to be a doctor. He could be putting patients in danger with thinking like that.
Your Dad is a capital B bigot and sees you simply as an extension of himself‚Äî not as your own person. You‚Äôll eventually leave at some point‚Äî if it is safe for you, I would consider thinking about getting out of that space sooner than later. Especially if he continues to be verbally hostile. If you can, I‚Äôd start saving money. 

I would also look into any opportunities for pro-bono therapy if it is offered to trans youth in your area. I‚Äôm so sorry you have to deal with this. And I wish you had a parent who appreciated your letter. Do you have any friends nearby who you think would be accepting?
""God doesn't make mistakes""
Yeah but biology does. If he's a doctor he's spending a good portion of his time fixing biological mistakes.

Doesn't he know about intersex people with chromosomal abnormalities? Doesn't he know about Swyer Syndrome?

I'm not saying that being trans is a biological mistake but sometimes when you talk to bigots you have to make them realize it's not a choice, it is a biological abnormality.

It's hard for bigots to wrap their heads around it because it's unseen in the mind, you can't plug your brain into theirs and let them expirience your disphoria.

The ultimatum is awful but I'm willing to bet there are a few allies among your family. If he's willing to cut you out of his life then why on earth would you give up something that would significantly help your mental well being to stay with someone against you.

I hope you have people in your life who support you because that is so important when your family doesn't.
Im sorry but this is why ill never be religious. Ppl, and it sounds like this is the case are just using god as an excuse for bigotry. 


If they actually cared what god thought, they would love and accept you for who you are. But they dont they just have a biggoted opinion of gender and sex and use god as an excuse
If you‚Äôre able to be financially independent, I‚Äôd advise that you do leave ASAP. If you feel safer playing along with what he wants in the meantime, that‚Äôs entirely fair. It‚Äôs not morally wrong to lie in self-defense against bigots.

If you need more time to become financially independent, I‚Äôd advise keeping your head down, pretending you‚Äôve seen the error of your ways and playing cis but prioritizing an exit plan on the DL, if you can tolerate it for a while. Safety is important, and it‚Äôs often better to delay transition if that‚Äôs what you have to do to avoid homelessness.
Well, that's a bag of dicks. Sorry
I'm sorry this happened to you. Your dad is really being an ass. 
If he's a doctor can you get him to read some scientific articles about transgender? Is there anyone in the family that could help you?
Your father is making this all about him when it's not about him at all. 
Sometimes initial reactions are not lasting ones but in the meantime you may have to postpone transition to stay safe.
I hope things get better for you soon.
For his patients' sake, I sincerely hope none of them are LGBTQ+. I would hate to think that any of them have heard even half of the fucked up shit he said to me.
I've suspected for a while now that and he and my mom (who's currently not available) might just see me as a trophy that they can parade around and show off to their family and friends, and this, unfortunately, just proves it. I've been seriously thinking about opening up art commissions to start gaining some type of income, so I'm already ahead of the curve on that.

I never thought about pro-bono therapy, but that's definitely something to look into after the shitshow I've been through. Unfortunately, there's no in my area that I can turn to IRL, so I'm basically on my own with this.
Even if I did, he won't read them. Like I said, he thinks he already knows *everything* because he's been a doctor for 35 years, and according to him, being trans is white people shit that was made up just so being transgender was removed from the DSM because it was now oppressing white people...your thinking really can't get anymore backwards than that. And I really don't think I can rely on a single person in my family to help me out with this either. They're also pretty religious, and the country they originate from, Nigeria, is notoriously anti-LGBT, so they're likely just going to repeat the same stuff he said, too. I'm basically fighting for myself here.
Maybe it‚Äôs reportable. I bet he wouldn‚Äôt like that.
Even if it is, it's not really in my best interests to do that. He's the only person in my immediate family with an income ever since my mom landed in the hospital, so if he loses his license and can't practice anymore, we're basically kinda fucked.
I was thinking of it as a threat to prevent him doing anything to you, assuming it‚Äôs necessary."	zsaqg3	trans	27	0.93	2022-12-22 03:23:38
Please remember to be a nice person‚Ä¶	I just want to say to people as you head down this road.  I don‚Äôt care how beautiful you  are or will become  on your journey remember to treat people with respect,  remember that you were not always the beautiful ‚Äúbutterfly‚Äù you are now  or will become you were the caterpillar trying to break free.  don‚Äôt look down your nose at people who may not be as far along as you may be.  I have encountered many that thought they were ‚Äúsuperior‚Äù because they got to the ‚Äúpoint‚Äù quicker or maybe they were already more feminine acting than you so they would try to tell you what you are NOT instead of letting you be the fabulous person you already are or need to be, or their dysphoria may be more severe than yours may be,  people are too caught up in absolutes or ‚Äúblack and white‚Äù that they can‚Äôt see the  true beauty in shades of grey, just because you may have been lead to believe you were literally ‚Äúalways a woman‚Äù doesn‚Äôt mean that you are better than someone who came to realize who they are by taking a different route to end up at the same place, I know I was born male but I always wanted and wished I wasn‚Äôt you ARE NO BETTER THAN ANYONE!    Remember if you can help someone if you can do it.  And also don‚Äôt feel forced to be or act in a way that is not genuine for you its not necessary to erase all thing ‚Äúmasculine‚Äù or deny that you ever were male I don‚Äôt get that at all , and dont let someone rush you, go at your own pace.   The things you may want to partake in may be frowned upon by the community but remember the community isn‚Äôt paying your bills,  whats has the community ever sacrificed for you?  You owe them nothing‚Ä¶..but like I said don‚Äôt kick down the ladder behind you for someone else.  This community needs more people that are nice like ‚ÄúBlanca‚Äù‚Ä¶and less arrogant people, beauty is not everything its an added plus given to few, so cherish it but be kind to those that you may be further along and more mature in your journey  or may ‚Äúpass‚Äù better than she does because by a twist of fate that could have been you that has to walk like that, help her not laugh at her or gatekeep her.  Welcome her not tell her how she ‚Äúhas to be and act‚Äù. Not all women are femme some are butch some are in the ‚Äúmiddle‚Äù.  But like I said be nice because one day your beauty is going to fade and who you really are is going to show its true face.  Be nice even when nobody is looking, especially when nobody is looking because thats who you really are.  If anyone reads this thank you.  And remember a diamond is still a diamond even before they cut and polish it.	"Yeah it‚Äôs fucking weird because, obviously basing value judgements on any kind of beauty standards is unhealthy to begin with, we all know that, it‚Äôs such a basic thing. So why would it be any better for us to do?

I don‚Äôt care if I pass or whatever. I‚Äôd like to change my appearance for *sure*, but I can‚Äôt always put that much effort in. It‚Äôs hard enough keeping up with everything else in life. I look pretty good most of the time anyway
Agreed. Some of us are simply physically different and it takes longer and often harder to present well in our desired gender.  Personally it's such a struggle to be femme and not currently out and transitioning that I find it impossible to be anything other than super sweet to other trans folk when I clock them. I want to say, ""I know you are on a journey sweetie and you are doing great."" Instead I will say something like, ""you must be a professional makeup artist, I love that eyeliner! When I'm in guy mode that might get a glare and I smile and say I'm in the club too. Some of us have a hard time accepting ourselves no matter if and where we are in transition. When I finally realized dysphoria was never going away, I told my wife, we cried and I got laser hair removal just so I could breathe.  While I wouldn't wish what I have on anyone. I've learned to love being female inside and I only want to share the ability to make others feel accepted,  beautiful or handsome.  We are only as good as we give to others."	rlwvhg	trans	28	0.87	2021-12-22 04:24:37
Insidious new law would effectively ban gender affirming care nationwide	"In Tennessee, Republicans have introduced legislation that would effectively ban gender affirming care nationwide.

It works by banning insurance companies who provide GAHC to anyone, anywhere, on any plan, from administering their TennCare program. TennCare is their version of Medicaid. Many private insurers also act as contractors for Medicaid programs, which is a low-risk, high profit gig for them. 

Tennessee may be relatively small, but if this law survives challenges at the Federal court level (which it likely would in the 6th Circuit), insurers would have to decide between lucrative contracts and taking care of trans people. And, assuming it survives Federal court scrutiny, you can expect Florida and Texas to replicate the bill - their Medicaid programs are fare more lucrative for insurers to participate in.

The ban on insurers that provide GAHC does NOT have an age requirement - it's for all persons, anywhere in the United States. It was introduced by their House speaker, and is HB1215. Link here, and to the article.

[https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB1215/2023](https://legiscan.com/TN/text/HB1215/2023)"	"But somehow they still get to claim they're not engaged in genocide.
And several states have laws on the books requiring insurers operating in their states cover gender affirming treatment. So who wins? Sounds to me like, if this passes, TN is going to lose a lot of insurance providers.
I know they're evil and will stop at nothing, but I'm still shocked at how depraved they are? Man...
One state isn‚Äôt nationwide but even if it would happen it would still be available tho it could still be gotten out of pocket but that still isn‚Äôt ideal and I hope it doesn‚Äôt pass
This makes no sense, please stop spreading theories like this that are not legally possible. 

1. Each insurance company has their own ‚Äúcompany‚Äù per state. They are divided legally and one states laws cannot be enforced in others, ever. 
2. The commerce clause exists. It specifically forbids states regulating commerce in other states or attempting to. 
3. Even if they somehow attempted to do this, these things do not exist in a vacuum. Allowing this would mean any state would be able to enforce their specific rules on any other. That‚Äôs not something that any circuit court would let stand, such a decision would be counter to the entire history of American jurisprudence. 

It would suck for TN, but there will be ways to operate around it.
As the other's have said, there's no need for this level of panic over a clearly illegal law that has no basis in legal fact.
I mean, denial is a pretty big part of genocide
Correct. And as far as I'm aware, the ACA requires non-discrimination for gender transition care.

They're angling for a fight on the issue. They're probably hoping the Supreme Court will decide that trans affirming care can't be protected or something, or that the Federal government can't set rules around it.

A lot of insurance is nationwide (think United, BC/BS, Cigna) but licensed to local companies. For example, where I live, I have BC/BS but a specific carrier of the brand. They maintain a network, and I have access to the broader BC/BS network. My insurer isn't likely interested in TennCare, but BC/BS nationally is. So they might drop coverage and doctors for trans care, while my local insurer doesn't. Result? A smaller network and a smaller amount of coverage for trans procedures.

BTW this procedure could be used for abortion, too. My insurer specifically covers abortion, but what if they banned abortion coverage in the same way?
True but I see where OP is coming from.

The point is that insurance companies might fold rather than loose a whole state. I doubt it‚Äôll happen tho.
This is very true, I just never expected there would be so many people from outside of the hate movement to aid and abet the hate movement. I thought people would be able to recognize it through that denial.
I don't see the panic. Using your BC/BS example, mine is provided by Highmark in Delaware, who prior to the law passing didn't cover any gender affirming care. In other near by states without such mandatory coverage laws, BC/BS by other providers don't cover it at all. This is exactly why they have all of the smaller sub-companies, so they can cater to each state's requirements.

If they want to continue to operate in states that do require it, they can't just drop coverage because TN says so. I would argue that BC/BS cares more about maintaining business in the more highly populated blue states than they do Tennessee.

Of course this law is bad for those in TN, but it won't go anywhere nationally no matter what they say.
I hope not, I just want this trans panic to end
They'd rather lose 49 states, including the most populated blue states in the country, than one transphobic state? Highly doubtful. The numbers simply don't add up. Tennessee isn't that big of a population center.
Speaking of BC/BS I had their plan from Tennessee because my dad worked for Firestone. They told me I had dual role transvestite fetishism, a boy who only dresses up as a girl as a weird sex fetish... instead of my actual diagnosis of gender dysphoria my doctor, and that my blood test for hrt was an elective cosmetic surgery. I didn't live in Tennessee but my Dads company was headquartered there so that was the insurance I ended up with through his employer.
If it bleeds it leads. The panic on our side is well warranted but does end up making things worse as well.
I‚Äôm interpreting what OP‚Äôs point of view seems to be.
How long do you think it‚Äôll last?
Hard to tell. I feel like the recent attacks in our rights are escalating. Stay strong!
Ok, as long as I don‚Äôt loose access to HRT I think I‚Äôll be ok
You'll never lose access, it'll just get harder to get. They can't even effectively ban illegal drugs, let alone ones that are widely prescribed to old people.
True, I just hope it doesn‚Äôt become illegal as it‚Äôs easy for me to get rn

IK it‚Äôs not likely but at least I know I can find a way to get it
There will always be ways, you might just need an elderly mother type to give you their RX for more money vs getting it from the DR currently. 

There's no political will, or corporation that is willing to forgo the money of HRT for old people for the sake of hurting trans people taking them off-label. 

Like, I know queer history is somewhat obscure, but trans people getting HRT legally is a fairly new concept (like in the last 30 years or so). It was incredibly common in the 60-80s to take them illegally/off-label. We can easily just go back to that method. :) So don't worry about it.
I hope we won‚Äôt need to do that tho, and I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôll ever come to that, but I guess it helps to be prepared

ianal but I feel like it would also become an interstate issue which makes it federal jurisdiction, right?
That language at the top of article 2 needs an update (""national, ethnic, racial, or religious"") . Not only does the definition not protect trans people, it doesn't protect homosexuals, or disabled people, all of which were targets in the holocaust.
Then the UN can, and will punish them, right? How can anyone accept that?!

Fairness in sports goes both ways.	"I think it would be great if some politician introduced a bill to ban cis men from men's sports under the argument that it is unfair for trans men. Obviously the logic is flawed and the concept is stupid, but I think it's a good way to point out those same qualities in all of the garbage bills targeting trans women in women's sports.

Idk I just thought it would be really funny to watch transphobes be forced to oppose this law and essentially argue against the bills targeting trans women as well. That's it."	"Sports inherently arent fair. Biological advantages are used all the time. Just look at professional basketball. Running? Taller folk have longer strides. Swimming? taller people have longer strokes. 

My solution is simple. Genderless sports for all, we know women can give ass in any sport and just restrict it by weight and height for ultimate fairness.

Maybe it doesn't work for MMA or fighting but id much rather that be used as an outside case than the norm for some reason.
Weight and height categories are enough for most contact sports or body size related sports like basketball. Technical skill based sports (climbing, tennis, volleyball, badminton, baseball, archery and anything with guns, you get what I mean) don't really need to be separated at all. I don't think that climbing is separated by gender, the tournaments I've seen at least aren't. Wrestling also isn't separated by gender, at least it wasn't when I did it in highschool. More guys joined the team than girls but the girls that were on the team were just as good as the boys.
This a completely stupid idea and I love it. It shows the ridiculousness of it all when it comes to bans on trans athletes.
I have a hunch the the NWSL will be the first professional sports team to have an FTM in the league.
Fairness in sports requires brackets and divisions.

 There are specific biological advantages such as height and weight that actually do have an effect in performance, and only by seperating for these can we ensure fairness.

Gender brackets themselves are nonsense.
I absolutely agree, this was just an idea I had to point out hypocrisy in a loud way. Gendered sports is dumb.
Speaking strictly on wrestling (purely because I find it interesting lol), physical advantages are only marginal and it's truly a sport of technique. Wrestling matches can certainly be won by brute force and they are all the time, but a skilled wrestler that knows when to fight back and when to throw their weight into a shot will beat an unskilled wrestler every single time.

My brother was a wrestler and seeing some of the people his scrawny ass was able to beat made me realize how crazy the sport is and how amazing precise control of muscle groups can be!

Anyway, not to derail the topic, wrestling is just cool because it *is* neutral and that's fucking rad.
It's also the levels of competition. Since woman's sports is not as popular at the highest level relatively, the skill at the highest level is also lower relatively."	tpb7lp	trans	26	0.84	2022-03-27 03:09:28
I'm afraid being a trans person in the US. CW: transphobia, sexual assault	"I'm FTM and I've been transitioning for a few years now. I'm afraid of being out in the US because of the anti-transgender bathroom bills and healthcare bills and sports bills that continue to be introduced and passed in the south. I am afraid of being trans due to the rise of TERF and truscum viewpoints. I've been sexually assaulted in high school because I was trans and my perpetrator fetishized me. I was a victim of an anti-trans ""bias incident"" at my university. Even though I live in a ""liberal"" area, I still experience transphobia and can have issues accessing healthcare. I am afraid. I know transpeople in other countries have it so, so much worse but I still don't feel safe.

I apologize for the rant. I just needed to get this off of my chest."	"Well, they don't give out any bouquets to us for being trans.  But you've got to be true to yourself.  üåπ

You're right, it is scary, and I'm right there with you on many days.

Needing resources to help my 70 year old conservative dad understand	My dad has just decided to finally address my transition and through his tears last night he told me that he was worried because of what he hears people around him and in the media say about trans people but that he supports anything I do and that he just knows nothing. He understands some basic concepts but I need some stuff i could send him to help him read up on stuff. Everything from trans acceptance, how to address my transition, and even some of the problems we face (harassment, bills meant to restrict our rights, etc). He wants to understand and accept me finally and I'd appreciate anything. Articles, YouTube videos, anything.

Why do we need potty police?	"I just read an article last night and it disgusted me.  So let me say, I live in Florida,  one of the really conservative republican states.  The article stated that trans people are no longer allowed to use the bathroom that matches their gender identity if the bill passes (I feel it will). I don't understand that a private space such as a bathroom is such a big issue.  I go in to relieve myself or wash my hands, nothing more.  Yet I guess they still see us trans as pedophiles for some reason which we are not.  We just need to go potty.  This is going to cause so much discomfort for people all over the state that are trans.  According to the bill you can be punished with 60 days in jail or a 500$ fine for using the bathroom that aligns with your gender identity.
 
My work has me all over town and if this becomes severely enforced, it means I have to feel super uncomfortable being a woman going into the men's room.  Not to mention that makesblife more dangerous for me from others.  Like why must these politicians make our lives so difficult?  All we want to do is exist, be happy and be ourselves. Why can't they just leave us alone üòí Why is it alright for the government to discriminate us like this?

I guess I'll be spending time in jail then if this passes, I'm not going into the men's room.  I am a women and I'm valid as such.  I will still use the bathroom that fits my gender identity.  This is why I continue to fight and protest for our rights as trans folks.  We don't don't deserve to be treated like lepers by politicians that are suppose to help their people.  Instead they do the complete opposite of that.  

*sigh*  

Trans men are men and trans women are women.  We are valid and we won't be erased"	"The suffering is the point. 

Conservatives relish in making people that aren't ""like them"" suffer.  It's incredibly sad and pathetic, but I think it's the only way they can feel good about themselves.
Feel like this is gonna cause more issues than it solves, have you seen some of the absolute beefcake hunk transmen out there? Whats going to happen when they walk into a womens restroom?
Just let trans people exist ffs üôÅ
Who will be policing this? Will there be a law enforcement officer stationed in every toilet, checking the genitalia of everyone who goes in? ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
*Senate Bill 1674 would make it a misdemeanor for an adult to refuse to immediately leave a restroom ‚Äúdesignated for the opposite sex‚Äù when ‚Äúasked to do so by another person present in the restroom.‚Äù Penalties would be up to 60 days in jail or $500 fine.*

As this reads you'll have to leave when asked by another person in the restroom with you.

This is going to equally affect masculine leaning cis women as well. I've already seen a number of posts and articles where masc women were accosted by transphobes while using public restrooms. 

All of my identification says female on it so unless someone comes with a search warrant for genital examination they can piss off and move along.
You are now living in a fascist state/country. That's the way they roll. I am really sorry for all the minorities in your country. Hope you'll find a way to coexist with all those stupid laws they try to establish. üåà‚úä
so do they like. check in peoples‚Äô pants? to make sure they have the right bits?

because i know i‚Äôve definitely met cis men that dress feminine and cis women that present masculine. are they gonna stop them from going into their correct bathroom because they don‚Äôt ‚Äúlook‚Äù like the right sex?

fucking cunts
So us being happy with how we are and feeling good about ourselves means we have to suffer?  That is such a sad thing, it's not my fault you're not happy with yourself.  I just don't see how people can only be happy by making others suffer.   I go out of my way to make people happy and I feel good about that.  If I upset or offend somebody I feel regret.  Just wish these politicians shared such a value.
Because they think America is merely a republic, it should be dominated and ruled by them as a right given by God and natural order. That's why deep rooted racism, transphobia and sexism are so dangerous. America is both a democracy and a constitutional republic. It was perfect for them in the olden days when minorities and women didn't have a voice, education or political opinions. Their rights were not protected. They were free to discriminate, judge and hate without any repercussions or consequences. That's why they target WOKE. They don't like the demographic changes and culture shifts which they see as both pose a threat to their rule and their thinking. They are using the same tactics in the 70s used against gay movement. Think stonewell Inn incident. Through fear, intimidation and bigotry. They have learned nothing at all. History will punish those who do not learn from it. 

Love is the greatest force in the universe which transits through time, life and death. Every biological beings on this planet were born to learn, adopt, connect and seek out their own kind. That's why hate is a much greater burden to bear than love. They will fail and truth, justice, and light will always prevail in the end. ‚úä

Change is the fundamental law in the universe. Nature does not care what man made society thinks about how thing should be done. Human advancement only has one direct: that is up and for the advancement of all mankind. Annuit c≈ìptis. üíôü§ç‚ù§Ô∏è
Exactly my point.  Doesn't matter if your a Trans man or woman.  This just makes things way worse then actually help.
Idk how they are but only way I can see is a person wasting a police officers time with something as this instead of them dealing with more important affairs such as crime or emergencies.  I've been using the woman's room since I came out and I've never be verbally assaulted or shunned with others in there.
I agree with you completely.  

This is why it's so important for us to fight for ourselves.  I really wish we could outlaw conservatism, especially in this country.  It's nothing but a pipeline to fascism, and I truly believe they get some sick perverse joy out of persecuting others.  

I'm happy there are still people out there that try very hard to make sure that others are happy.  I don't believe it's possible to be a conservative and actually have values other than ""hurt the other"", though.  It's entirely reactionary and it gives these idiots a way to dismiss the bad situations in their lives by pointing at people like us and blame us for their shortcomings.
That's why fighting is so important.  If they have their way, then we will lose those same rights as soon as they can feasibly make it happen.  And they're all about making sure mankind backslides into whatever dark ages they fantasize about.
I know is crucial for there to be any real change and I will fight till the end of times. I fight for our rights as trans and the rights of others. They can't take my happiness and existence.  I will fight for this till I die.
Yes, exactly!  I know I'm late to getting into the fighting game, but I'm not scared anymore, and I'm going to continue to fight until they put me in the grave! <3
Nobody is gonna fight for us, so we need to take it in our own hands to make the world a safe place for all trans folk!  United we are strong.
I hate so much that you're right, but it doesn't change how I feel.  I will always work to provide a united front with all of our trans brothers and sisters.
Oh it doesn't change how I feel either but we need to be strong to fight the demons in political power.  They can try but will fail in trying to erase our existence.  Even if this bill or any others pass that restrict me I will continue doing what I have a right as a human can do.  If I have to be put in jail for fighting for my rights so be it."	128kj5v	trans	22	0.82	2023-04-01 12:12:13

1. Help organize your coworkers to build the labor movement.

2. Use organized labor to aid in expanding the rights of LGBT people and all workers and oppressed in your workplace generally.

3. Ignore everyone who tells you to donate to this or that lobbying group because without a party that serves our interests it‚Äôs a waste of time and resources that could‚Äôve been spent elsewhere and whenever that party appears, it‚Äôs going to need a labor movement willing to support it.

Plenty of people on here may disagree with me, and that‚Äôs perfectly fine, but neither you nor I benefit from the current state of things and changing that starts with organizing our class.
You're a wonderful person. Thank you
The best thing would be to try to not let it happen there, in Brazil I mean. This could be something as simple as being nice to trans people you know or voting for more trans friendly politicians to something like getting involved in activism or running for a political office yourself if you're able and want to.
Thank you for your compassion üôè the best way to maximize your impact and support of marginalized groups is to start close to home. I‚Äôm sure there are trans people in your local community who need immediate support, who don‚Äôt have the world‚Äôs attention at the moment. Check and see what opportunities are available close by!
Que tal lutar aqui, hein?
I don‚Äôt think I‚Äôm doing anything much tbh, part of my community is in harms way and I should do my part to help.
I‚Äôm flattered with all the praise but I don‚Äôt think I deserve it. I‚Äôm queer too, trans people have helped me a lot, personally and historically. 

I have rights because of people like Marsha P Johnson. I have trans friends who have helped me through thick and thin.

If part of my community, people who helped me be able to have rights, are in danger, of course I‚Äôll help however I can! This isn‚Äôt being ‚Äúfantastic‚Äù, it‚Äôs being a decent human being.
Ah yeah, I should‚Äôve mentioned, I‚Äôm a minor with no income.
Helping part of my community doesn‚Äôt make me a wonderful person, trans people have helped me too, I‚Äôm just seeing how I can be a decent human being.
Our newest elected president is left leaning so he won‚Äôt do anything about trans people in all likelihood, on top of that, states don‚Äôt have that much independence here, so we‚Äôre fairly safe, at least for the next 4 years
I had a trans friend who I tried my best to help, but things between us are not the best right now for personal reasons which I won‚Äôt get into. I study in a Catholic school and most the people there are conservative, right wing, bigots. I still have another trans friend who I do my best to help as well(although their problems are not exactly related to being trans ATM).

I help and affirm the trans people I know irl however I can, but I still feel mostly useless in regards to the human rights abuses currently taking place around the globe but specially in the US, and Ik that feeling is shared by many trans people. Even while not being directly affected by the situation in the US it is still my responsibility to care for my community however I can.
Mano as coisas aqui t√£o bem mais de boa que l√°, e eu ajudo aqui tamb√©m como eu posso. A gente tem acesso a horm√¥nio e cirurgia muito mais de boa que nos Estados Unidos.

Para com o pensamento tribalista que √© ajudar um ou o outro, a gente tem que ajudar nossa comunidade toda, no nosso pa√≠s e fora.
And even if I wasn‚Äôt queer, even if trans people hadn‚Äôt helped me, doing the minimum to condemn human rights abuses and help those who are in danger is not virtuous, it‚Äôs simply not being a asshole.
Oh hell yeah, organize your classmates. 

Run for student government, organize a walkout/protest, agitate how schooling as it exists reinforces the current class interests to the detriment of the youth and oppressed along race, sex, gender, etc. STUDY analysis and history of the oppression of LGBT people and study generally, having a well rounded education is crucial.

The point still stands, organize the people around you. You are youth? Organize the youth! There are LGBT people amongst the youth, your job is to aid them by all of us collectively building the tools of our liberation.
Brazil even offers free bottom surgery through SUS(Sistema √önico de Sa√∫de or Unique Health System) if I‚Äôm not mistaken.
A way I‚Äôm planning to help is in my sociology class. My teacher told me that if my class/grade is mature enough(which I‚Äôm not sure it is/will be), we will have a debate on gender. I love informing myself about trans people and I have infinitely more information then I‚Äôll need to destroy any of the bigots in my class in a debate. So the plan is to try to create some curiosity and critical thinking in my classmates so they will become more open minded about trans people.

Ok, concordo que a nossa situa√ß√£o tamb√©m n√£o √© ideal, mas como que eu posso melhorar a situa√ß√£o aqui? Eu n√£o posso votar ainda, eu j√° demonstro meu suporte, n√£o vou em manifesta√ß√µes nem nada assim porque se eu for meus pais me expulsam de casa. Eu nunca vejo nenhuma oportunidade de melhorar a situa√ß√£o aqui sem me colocar em risco de rua. Se voc√™ tiver sugest√µes sou todo ouvidos.
Olha, eu totalmente entendo a parada de n√£o poder ir na rua. Meu pai n√£o me deixou ir em 2013, eu estava no ensino m√©dio na √©poca. Mas tem muita coisa pra ser feita sem necessariamente sair em uma marcha na rua, existem coletivos que podem te explicar muito bem quais s√£o os problemas que n√≥s passamos aqui. E vc pode fazer coisas tanto se encontrando com pessoas quanto de casa pela internet.
N√£o fique ansioso, mesmo que voc√™ sinta que a situa√ß√£o est√° muito calamitosa. Para quem realmente quer olhar, o buraco √© bem mais em baixo. Voc√™ deve ser bem novo, e os jovens hoje tem que crescer com a id√©ia de que talvez nao haja futuro que valha a pena, em v√°rios aspectos. Mas voc√™ pode tirar conforto sabendo que essa luta n√£o se faz em dias ou anos, mas ao longo da vida toda, e s√≥ de querer fazer o melhor que vc pode j√° diz q vc come√ßou mto bem. Enfim, tem um exemplo de organiza√ß√£o que est√° justamente nessa luta, que √© a luta de muito mais gente que s√≥ n√≥s trans.

Is there any good news for trans people in the USA?	I keep accidentally doom scrolling anti trans bills. It makes me panic but I can‚Äôt look away. Is there anyone fighting these bills? Does congress or anyone have any plans to protect us? Is there any hope for us or are we in a slow spiral to federal bans and loss of rights? üò•üò≠	"The important thing to remember is that ""bills being introduced"" does not automatically entail ""bill passing two houses of government and being signed into law by the executive."" Yes, in deeply red states where the Republicans have control over all three, things don't look good. In solidly blue states, this ga have never been better for LGBTQ+ people and things are only constantly improving.

Federally you are safe for at least a other two years. In my opinion, the Republicans are diving way too hard into the extreme-right fringe to ever regain a trifecta (where they control the white house and both branches of Congress), but people often call me an optimist. 

Even IF the Rs get that trifecta (including a super majority of 60 seats in the Senate), there's nothing to say that blue states need to enforce federal laws (look at all the sanctuary states/cities when it came to immigration).

If all else fails, I am properly equipped and trained to fight for what is right.
I was honestly just about to ask this, I‚Äôve been on like a week doomscroll, please do let me know if anyone says anything positive, I think we could all use some comfort right now
I said this here already but, it may seem bleak that some of this legislation is getting pushback from quite a bit of people in charge, and we may be in for a rough ride...

Despite that though, these guys are actively going against the tides of history, and actions such as this are actions that historically never go well for those involved. It may take some fighting to do, but culture wars in the United States are unfortunately very common. They just decided that trans folk would be the next ones. 

I think once though, if this gets fuckin crazy, there will be pushback from those who want to fight back against these things
These bills are an increasingly desperate series of strikes against us. Increasingly desperate because we are making progress. Also, most cis people seem to be unaware of this shit, we can probably stamp it out if we share the information around.
the good news is we aren't actually responsible for anything bad happening so eventually voters will lose interest when a recession or climate change does its thing
Well, there is always the supreme court that tends to step in and say ""no dammit you can't do that!"" when states go too far.

There are also states where the law is quite in our favor and it's not terribly difficult to move if it gets too bad. I live in a state that has a long history of being against everything LGBT. But guess what? Things are changing. I can now legally change my birth certificate without requiring surgery. For me, that is huge here. Up until recently, I was unable to do that.

Overall, don't keep silent, protect yourself as needed, and don't be afraid of being who you are. Nobody ever said it would be an easy fight.
No not really.
no
In the red states, they are sailing right through. Missouri reviewed 8 bills alone today and people lined through the door to speak against but were denied the right. And Arkansas is really bad too. This was from today. It easily passed the Senate and will sail through the House (which is equally conservative): https://substack.com/app-link/post?publication_id=994764&post_id=98757461&utm_source=post-email-title&isFreemail=true&token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjo3NDg5NzQ4MywicG9zdF9pZCI6OTg3NTc0NjEsImlhdCI6MTY3NDU5OTg4OCwiZXhwIjoxNjc3MTkxODg4LCJpc3MiOiJwdWItOTk0NzY0Iiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.kcO6CfzhwSaruNU4f0bMD2Xaq4SnspZkpL5c8Er_ELs

Unpopular opinion: Please stop talking about states like Florida, Texas, etc. as if we're horrifically dangerous places that everyone needs to evacuate immediately. It doesn't help.	"I know this might get me some hate, but please read the full post before commenting. I'm a Florida native and, especially lately, I've been seeing a LOT of rhetoric that my state is dangerous to live in, that every queer person needs to evacuate and find other places to live, that our governor is going to round us up and take us to the firing squads, etc.

I'm not going to lie and say my state is some safe haven; it's bad. Every one of us that lives in these red states **knows** it's bad. If you're a parent of a trans kid, you have legitimate reason to get the hell out and protect your kid.

However, there are still places in the state where it's relatively safe to be visibly queer. Orlando especially is still aggressively accepting, and other cities (Miami, Tampa, etc.) have large queer communities as well, with robust support networks and regular actions and protests. Queer people can and do flourish here.

I'm not saying it's everyone's responsibility to stay and fight and risk their own personal safety. Decisions like fleeing a person's home are deeply personal, and I'm not faulting the people who leave to protect themselves or their kids.

However, when we start talking about evacuation and getting all queer people out of the state, it makes the rest of us feel abandoned, written off, like we're lost causes. There are a lot of us who can't leave or, more importantly, simply don't want to leave the community they grew up in and the friends and connections they've made over their lives to start fresh, isolated, in another state.

It does us a disservice when people who have never stepped foot in our community, who only know about Florida through national reporting on our *many* transphobic bills, pass judgements on the entire state and write us off as a dangerous place to be. 

That kind of rhetoric only stresses out those of us who can't or won't leave, and it's also **exactly what the Republican supermajority legislatures want.** Their long-term strategy is to cause everyone who disagrees with them to leave these states and further entrench their hold on the legislatures.

**It only takes 38 Republican supermajority legislatures to amend the U.S. Constitution**, and there are already **20**. If enough people flee to the same few blue states, nobody will be safe, no matter whether they're in a safe haven like New Jersey or a ""deep-red hellhole"" like Florida. And if that doesn't sound realistic to you, ask yourself whether our current situation felt realistic five or ten years ago.

The point of all this ranting is: when you're talking to someone in one of these deep-red states or talking about those states, instead of immediately encouraging them to GTFO, first help them to connect with their local queer community. See what resources there are for them in their state (e.g. to access HRT despite state bans, legal representation, etc.) and leave evacuation as a last resort. It's a much more sustainable strategy."	"You are a frog in boiling water. 

At this point in their fascist escalation it is irresponsible and even dangerous to suggest for LGBTQIA+  not to flee Florida if they have it in their power to do so. Preferably before they start setting up the ""deconversion"" camps that they've already been eluding to. I'm sorry if that makes people feel left behind. I would encourage you to get to know your local queer community in an effort to seek aide in fleeing the state. 

Your governor is breaking laws left and right to turn the state into his own little authoritarian playground, and since your state legislators are Republican majority they are happily going right along with the fascist transition. 

Florida, is at the point where they are using the force of the state to target and eliminate certain demographics of people very openly. Swing states we can argue there is a possibility of redeeming, but Florida very openly wants blood and violence. 

 I cannot understand how someone from within the groups these people are targeting can still be deceived by the illusion that we are going to be able to ""ride out the storm"" in these conservative areas. That mentality is not safe and has proven to be a terrible bet to make in times like this. History proves it is safer to relocate and fight for wider national acceptance to beat back the outliers like Florida, Texas, Georgia, Tennessee and many others. 

Republicans are out for Genocide, for real.
Asking people to go to war who are ill-equipped to fight is the same as sentencing them to death. It's one thing if you want to volunteer to fight. As an adult that's your right. But we're supposed to be creating a world where children don't have these sorts of concerns for their safety and security. Obviously we're failing at that. It's time to get children and vulnerable people out of Florida.
The point of telling people to evacuate *now* is because when it's ""evacuate immediately"" it will already be too late.  

Florida Republicans, as well as in general nation wide have made it clear that getting rid of us is their.  Yes, leaving technically gives them what they want, but you will get out with your life and relative freedom.  

The question you have to ask yourself, when they decide to put ""eradicate"" into practice, will they *let* you leave?
Florida native here. 
My insurance coverage is a major factor in my decision about staying or leaving, also my ability to access health care in general.
I'm investigating a web based platform that might bridge the gap, but the increased financial burden might be prohibitive. 
I do not want to leave my home or my community, but I might have to. 
Solidarity with everyone who stays and solidarity with everyone who leaves.
I‚Äôm in Florida and my opinion is that of Michael Bolton in the movie office space. When asked why he doesn‚Äôt change his name since he hates the musician Michael Bolton so much he says why should he have to change his name, he‚Äôs not the one who sucks. I feel the same way. Why should I have to move they are the ones that suck. I am going to stay and keep fighting
Generally, I agree with you in the concept of if you flee, you can't change the system. I also agree that we have to fight for visibility and get allies to fight with us.

My biggest fear in all this is the numbers. As trans people, we aren't very many, about 1% of the population. Add to that and a lot of people, even those who would support us are uncomfortable with the whole transgender thing and that blocks them from trying to understand.

A lot of people in my social circle are what I would describe as supportive liberals, but I've gotten near complete radio silence from them when I've talked about how much the right is coming after us. Its like they don't want to engage, they don't really actually believe its happening, and I get the clear sense that if I really push the issue, I'll actually find out they have 'concerns' about trans people and that the right actually has a few good points. AAAHHHRRRRGGGHHH!!!

So, yeah, that's where I start freaking out and saying, at some point, you gotta look after yourself. I'm all for fighting the fight, but I'd also recommend keeping an eye on the escape hatch too.

Because the people who are coming after us don't care about us at all. We trans people are a complete political sacrifice to them. We're the perfect target minority: We are a pretty small group, we're easily misunderstood and demonized, and there's little political consequence for them to try to eradicate us.

Add in the general over polarization of our country, the republicans distrust in elections and their outright corruption in gerrymandering and general governance and I genuinely worry for this country. They're gunning hard for democrats, and they have absolutely no issue using us trans people to further their goals.

Ultimately, its not about us, its about their power. They're punching down on us to boost their power with their base. And as long as a big portion of this country looks at trans people with skepticism, we are endangered everywhere.

Evacuation should be a last resort, but a last resort isn't really a viable option most of the time. By the time you consider it to be time to use that last resort, it might already be too late. It's very difficult to judge when it's too dangerous to stay, and even when it is it's hard to come to terms with that. The reason people are saying to evacuate is because of that fact. It's easier to evacuate now and then if you wish to move back after the dust clears, than to get stuck in the crossfire and be in worse shape when the dust does eventually clear. 

Please note I am not American this is just my take as someone watching this unfold from an ocean away.
Just cause you aren‚Äôt being dropped in boiling water right off the bat doesn‚Äôt mean the water isn‚Äôt close to boiling.  

They‚Äôre openly talking about eradicating us in Florida.  It‚Äôs well past the point of debating whether or not to leave.  Leave NOW while you still can.  Homeless and alive in another state is better than dead or force-detransitioned in a camp.
So long as the democrats won't play dirty like the GOP, they're helping the fascists take over.  Look how they're standing by allowing all of this to happen to us.  While the attacks against us come every single day, we might get a halfhearted rule proposal once every several months, at best, or a letter with words and no action.

That being the case, we don't only need to be working on getting queer people out of red states.   We need to be working on getting queer people out of the United States altogether.  Nobody is on our side.  The 14th Amendment has forsaken us.

At this rate in another ten years, the United States will be New DPRK.  As such, we need international treaty organizations enforcing agreements with sanctions and preparing for the very real possibility that the United States will become the next rogue state to threaten the species.

The human species can either act now or wish we had while we wait for the nukes to fall.  The GOP doesn't obey the law, violates principles of democracy, and openly aspires to genocide without consequence.  It's time to accept we've already lost.
I think the idea is that sunshine (metaphorically) is curative. For instance, we saw what just happened in Tennessee. The more we talk outside of Texas and Florida, the more likely these states may feel external pressure to improve.
I'm an Australian and I'm genuinely scared of travelling to the USA. The world does not view well the fascist behaviours that a lot of the states are exhibiting.
I also just don't want to get shot. You have too many guns!
Florida is going to pass a law legalizing them kidnapping trans kids from their parents even if they are just visiting or on vacation in Florida it's outright dangerous. There is a good reason people are told to flee, Jews had some warning in Germany before it led to genocide, most didn't leave and the rest is history, actually the Nazis actually tried to ship a lot of Jewish people to other countries, Canada denied taking in Jews same as many other countries, Ron DeSantis won't put trans people on a bus or boat and try and get rid of them like that. They literally have ERADICATION on their minds it's a GLOBAL fascist movement against trans rights, they are trying to bring fascism everywhere but they can only get a hold in red states really and places like Africa legalized the death penalty for gay/LGBT+

If everyone stayed there are still way too many Maga fascists you won't make much progress at all that's another reason people are saying leave if you can, much safer for people to regroup make sure blue states stay blue, the maga fascists had a mass exodus moving out of blue states to places like Florida. Many of us I'm Canadian are exposing Floridas corrupt laws they aren't budging because Florida is full of Maga fascists DeSantis won by a large margin, if the media didn't control the flow of information then truth would show some Maga supporters they are an authoritarian Orwellian state, those two words are looked as bad by the far right, people are brainwashed by propaganda it takes time and lots of consistency exposing it for people to slowly realize they were misled, I wish people could be convinced this year just won't happen the first reaction of Maga is denial, they won't realize until they physically see concentration camps. If we had massive support exposing Florida then they may backtrack but even within the LGBT+ community barely anyone actually supports truth people aren't sharing my news articles or YouTube videos, how can progress be made with so much ignorance? Google shadow bans my news articles so they don't show on Google News even though it's setup to do so...we could get around the algorithm if people actually liked my YouTube videos so it can be shown to more people. We need to consistently share truth plant the seed and slowly more maga supporters will come to their senses it's going to be a process. If people were supporting my content Debunking antitrans misinformation and other peoples content then we could make progress this year and turn things around. It's sad. None of my friends in real life will even like my Facebook posts or YouTube videos so the algorithm can show to more people. MAGA are supporting each other a lot and I don't see many in the LGBT+ community supporting people who debunk the Misinformation.

Only a few select already popular trans activists are getting good support, we need everyone to support every trans person Debunking the lies we can't afford to say oh screw people like Megan (me) the movie disclosure pointed out that only a few trans voices are elevated seriously if people are opposing me within the LGBT community it doesn't look good. I wish it was safe for people in Florida and I'm trying I've exposed Ron DeSantis for a long time now since he went the antitrans route after tricking people to think Florida was freedom because they opposed lockdowns, I exposed how government denies science how cannabis saved lives with covid i got them checkmated on several angles and almost no support barely anyone likes any of my YouTube videos I get lots of dislikes and hate Maga are trying to make sure my content doesn't reach the masses. I've exposed details almost nobody else has. I made the sustainability Space Travel Documentary Antimatter Future antimatterfuture.com I advocate trans rights how come LGBT community is not supporting an LGBT documentary made by a trans woman? NASA are In Florida space coast, science can unite people but not if people refuse to support and share.

Everyone needs to support any source of information Debunking the lies we need the good content to be seen by more people. If there is a rise of people support media like me Debunking the antitrans misinformation we can make serious progress, since the support isn't there I blow the whistle on this, for people who choose to stay I'm still fighting and I'm Canadian would be nice if we had lots of support and could realistically say it's smarter to stay but for every trans woman like me Debunking the misinformation there are 100 antitrans media already popular. We Need lots of support not just elevating a few voices. People should be supporting debunking misinformation no questions asked I should not have had to make this post really seems Maga hijacked trans activism because explain opposition to me Debunking the misinformation? My 2k YouTube subs and lack of likes means my content doesn't reach many people my channel is not monetized

You're the second person to use this metaphor, and it's still wrong. We're not under any illusions. We **know** the water is already boiling. Again, I'm not saying it's not bad. 

What I'm saying is when people act like we're insane for not leaving, it does everyone else a disservice, especially the people who cannot leave and do not have the resources to simply flee. I'm saying there's still value in staying and helping to prop up the community, even if it might be a better/""safer"" decision for others to simply flee.

It simply doesn't feel right that the vast majority of people writing off Florida and implying people are insane to **not** be fleeing have never stepped foot in the state and have never lived in our communities.
The answer to that question is that, when they decide to put ""eradicate"" into practice, they're going to have a **lot** harder of a time rounding people up when they knock on doors and find robust communities who are armed and willing to defend themselves, instead of the dregs of the community, the least privileged, who couldn't simply up and leave. That's literally all I'm saying here; there's value in staying just as much as there's sense in leaving.
This is EXACTLY what a lot of us are saying, actually. Not unpopular at all, at least not in Florida's trans community. We've got a pretty robust anti-fascist movement here and they are not afraid to fight. Thanks for the well wishes <3
Again, I'm not saying it's not bad, but there absolutely is a place for people who choose to stay to support those who can't simply just leave. It doesn't help when people insinuate we're irrational or insane for choosing to stay and support our community, especially when they're not even from the state.
I am not implying anything on individuals. I am using my knowledge of history, politics, civil rights, law, sociology, psychology, and rhetoric, to try and explain why speaking out against fleeing fascism is wrong. 

For those who do not have the capabilities or resources to move, I will fight to aide in any way I personally can, and fight to make the system aide those people trapped in the Authoritarian capital of the United States. People who cannot flee should not be talked down to either. Which I certainly don't intend for any of this to come across as, so apologies if I've missed the mark. 

I speak with such ferocity to get the point across to people who may be less informed. They're not becoming fascist in Florida. They're already there, and leading the way for the rest of the nation to follow. Trump is a distraction at this point. People should be learning about DeSantis and what kind of monster a smart fascist is, compared to the bumbling narcissist that fueled their movement to this point.
Wouldn't be much harder for them since they'd just call the national guard. Then when the trans community fights back with weapons the Republicans will see that as justification for their laws and violence and cause more hatred among the country. 

No one's gonna be supportive of a group of people they feel like they need to tip toe around to avoid getting shot.

Wanting violence means wanting separatism. There's a difference between self defense and arming yourself. Someone who wants to self defend does not stay in hostile territory. They leave so they can advocate integration among others who are more willing to act in their favor."	12kug4h	trans	22	0.66	2023-04-13 16:18:47
North Carolina Senate passes SB 49, known as 'Parents' Bill of Rights' - why is there not more outrage?!?!	"""In North Carolina, the state Senate has passed SB 49, known as the controversial ""Parents' Bill of Rights."" The bill is often referred to as the ""LGBTQ bill."" It would require teachers to notify parents if a student questions their gender or uses different pronouns."" ([https://www.wyff4.com/article/north-carolina-senate-passes-sb-49-known-as-parents-bill-of-rights/42795491#](https://www.wyff4.com/article/north-carolina-senate-passes-sb-49-known-as-parents-bill-of-rights/42795491#))

This bill has been sent to the house, and Governor Cooper has said he is opposed to it, but hasn't officially said he plans to veto it. Even if he DOES veto it, our House only needs ONE democrat to flip and override the veto.

All I keep seeing - even from local advocacy groups - is messages with broken links to contact your representatives or bland statements of ""we stand with parents and LGBT students and blah blah blah.""

Where is the outrage? Where is the organizing, the protesting, the loud and public demand to protect our rights and the children of our community? This doesn't even touch on the proposed house bill that, if passed, will ban gender-affirming medical interventions for minors in our state.

I know my state. I know SB49, if passed into law, will, without a doubt, put innumerable children directly in harm's way at the hands of their parents, either through violence, eviction, or both.

I don't want to just call my representative and say pretty please, don't take away our rights. I'm seething and terrified, and more of us should be, and we should be screaming it at the top of our lungs, and if it's happening somewhere - ANYWHERE - in North Carolina, can somebody PLEASE direct me to it, because I JUST CAN'T TAKE THIS HATE ANY LONGER!!!"	"That no one is protesting against those oppresive fascists doesn't mean that no outrage will happen, it just means that it's getting closer. People protesting violently against those oppresive fascists is inevitable.
Yeah.
Just moved here from New York. And the vibes are definitely different. 

People confuse tough love and brutality cuz they think the more brutal they are the more blessed they will be.

Definitely don't protest violently. Honestly I don't know what to make of it all. As someone who who closeted their whole life and knows the pain of being forced to denial by a vicious community the whole thing makes me sad.

It's a whole lot of extra suffering for a whole lot of misunderstood kids.
we're watching as liberals once against throw us to fascist wolves to preserve the economic order. 

nothing to be alarmed about though... we're just being hyperbolic...
This reminds me how much I was terrorized by my parents before joing the military
But gives me peace with my decision to go no contact
I don‚Äôt even need it to be violently! But being told that the best thing to do is to contact our virtually outnumbered legislators and that advocacy groups are speaking on the floor is infuriating because that doesn‚Äôt seem to be working anymore. If appealing to their humanity was going to work, this already would not have passed the senate. They literally had medical professionals telling them why it was a dangerous idea, and they hand waved it away like it means nothing."	10xywcg	trans	20	0.86	2023-02-09 16:25:04

Is anybody else concerned about the Ohio bill that was passed?	I don‚Äôt know a whole lot about what happened, but apparently it forces trans kids to detransition in Ohio. Does anybody have any news on that?	"Yea. I think it also forces teachers to check childrens' genitals to make sure if they are trans or not like what the fuck? A small or large group of people are saying we are pedophiles yet they support that kind of action.
Concerned. Hoping it ain't as bad as you say.

Could you post a link on it? I‚Äôm not finding anything on it
I‚Äôm not finding anything
Not to mention it‚Äôs dehumanizing as fuck. Are there trans predators? Of course. Just like there are cis predators. As a victim of csa, it hurts to think about gender and identity being tossed into the ring when we‚Äôre talking about dangerous mental illness. More specifically, pedophiles and their victims. This is gonna get gross, so I guess here‚Äôs your trigger warning.

Pedophiles literally have damaged brains. When we see a cute kid or a baby or whatever, our brains instinctively go ‚Äúaww‚Äù. A pedophile will not. Their impulse is to respond with arousal. It doesn‚Äôt make a difference if they‚Äôre a man, woman, trans, cis, it‚Äôs literally having a damaged brain.

People like this need to be locked up away from humanity, and never allowed to be near or see a child ever again. I‚Äôm so, so grateful my abuser will be incarcerated for the rest of his miserable life. 

Bringing trans people into this discussion is nothing but pure and simple manipulation by the far right. And plenty of fence sitters sucked down the kool aid. They don‚Äôt care about children, they don‚Äôt care about families, and they sure as shit don‚Äôt care about sexual assault. If it has nothing to do with them personally, it can fuck off. So fuck that, and fuck them. Queer people have always been seen as sexual predators and I‚Äôm seriously sick of it.

How did you guys pay for your surgery?	"So today started off great right, Im a 24yr old FTM who has been waiting to hear literally anything about top surgery since god knows when and today i had a consult with an absolute unit of a doctor. mans was clear and kind, knew imediately what i needed and then sent me on my not so merry way so that i could get assessments ect ect BUT THEN I get the estimated price, over 12k and their is a maximum loan amount is 5k üò¨. 

I get 600 a month and half that goes to rent a good chunk of whats left goes towards bills and tax and honestly i barely afford food as it is i wont lie. like i got 2k saved but how the hell am i supposed to swing that much money and have stuff left for when i recover because as if my work gives decent sick leave to cover my bills. 

So in short how did you guys who have had surgerys swing it because Im pretty much fucked, im not even supposed to be working due to pre existing health conditions and I take alot of overtine üò¨

Honestly any advice is welcome my dudes because im really stumped"	"I saved up for quite a few years. Worked a job I hated but paid excellently and just grinded with overtime and was frugal af to save. (I even bought a book about penny pinching and saved money that way, if you're curious it is the Complete Tightwad Gazette I mean when I say penny pinching, this book is EXTREME.). I also picked up another side hustle to make extra money. 

My surgeon i chose didnt take my insurance, i paid 10k out of pocket. yowch! but I chose him for a reason, I'm insanely happy with my results. 

good luck. shit ain't cheap... but it's such a worthwhile investment üôè couldnt be happier with my body
Not me, but a friend of mine paid 3.5k. 12k sounds very expensive to me. Keep an eye out for other surgeons that have good results and are cheaper. Asking local LGBT groups is super helpful in my experience :)
I get my GAC through U.S. Veteram Affairs, at least as long as the fascists don't stop that.  

So, basically I paid for it by invading Iraq.
Insurance. Paid about $3000 out of pocket for it. Look into financal aid through the hospital. You may qualify for assistance/ reduced cost. There are also payment plan options as well. 

Short term disability, if you qualify for it at your job also helps offset the cost of the time off you'll need from work to recover. 

Other than that I worked extra hours, did odd jobs, saved my tax return money, minimized expenses and threw evey extra dollar I had toward it.
I live in a country with socialized healthcare
Insurance. I still don't know how much it'll be out of the pocket, but it should only be hundreds of dollars and not thousands. Without insurance, I never would've been able to afford surgery.
Honestly just work for ages and spend the better part of a decade as my pay was crap but overall worth it.
A Canadian citizenship.
Insurance. I also have a gofundme that got me about $150 (not nearly enough) that goes to a savings account that gains interest. It's not much, less than 50¬¢ a month but with insurance I only have to cover the deductible. Or at worst the out of pocket max. I'm probably gonna have to use the hospital's payment plan too
INSURANCE!
get a job that offers gender affirming care even just short term to cover your surgery.
I feel like the best top surgeons unfortunately are either private practice or are out of state, so in state insurances won‚Äôt cover. Getting you that 12k price range. 

Speaking from the US, unless you‚Äôre like in California, your own in state options may be limited, especially in more conservative states. 

In the state I am living in, there 1 top surgeon who has average results, and when I met with him, I didn‚Äôt feel completely validated nor listened to. But, at the time with my insurance I could‚Äôve gotten it covered. 

I chose not to, because I didn‚Äôt trust the doctor, forcing me to pursue outside state options, when bring me up to the 12k price range your talking about.

And if I am honest, even with working more jobs, and crowdsourcing, I will likely never afford.

A lot of people take out medical loans, but already having steep student loans that wasn‚Äôt an option for me. 

A lot of people also get family/friend support to assist which isn‚Äôt talked about enough. I had an acquaintance who literally ran a whole fundraiser, actually people did it on their behalf. There were like gifts for different donation leaves, and they had famous artists create pieces to promote and sell work specifically for this fundraising. They raised like 15k in something like 3/4 days.  

A smaller amount of folks win grant money, scholarships specifically for gender affirming surgeries. 

And also, some people just can afford it. Or maybe can afford it more. 

Keep in mind there‚Äôs loads of us who can‚Äôt afford these procedures, but the folks who‚Äôve have gotten them done are most often the people we see; posting, in media, etc.  

It‚Äôs really difficult. And I‚Äôm wishing you all the best to pull some strings and figure out some funds. But know you‚Äôre not alone in your shock, frustration, sadness.
I saw somebody tie a rubber band around they shit to get it tiny in width and just slice it off xD
Before I respond may I ask where you are?
How expensive is top surgery?  
  
While you can expect to pay thousands of dollars out-of-pocket or have insurance cover it (if applicable), you'll need to find out how much your surgery is going to cost. Most top surgeries, on average at the time of this post, are generally in the range of $5,800 - $9,000 but every person gets a different quote.

that is right off google my friend, it shouldn't be that expensive. I am only a 14y/o trans ftm and I decided to see how much it costs. Maybe find a cheaper doctor to do it, that will charge a normal price.
I‚Äôm not even gonna try in the US. Maybe in some other country in 50 years but not now. I can‚Äôt do it. I can‚Äôt go into debt like my mom has for the 17 surgeries I‚Äôve had.
My insurance covered it. I reach my catastrophic around April most years so, because my surgery was in August, I didn‚Äôt have a copay. My insurance didn‚Äôt cover the nipple grafts, but my surgeon did them for me for free. So I didn‚Äôt have any expenses here for which I am grateful; though, since I spend a ton of money on other medical conditions because I have a very expensive medication, it‚Äôs kind of bittersweet, but I may as well make the most of the situation.
Thankyou sm, i will definately give it a look!
Thats a good idea! Thankyou! and yeah almost had a heart attack when I got the email lol
Not to mention all the shit you dealt with as trans in armed forces, deepest sympathy!! I could not pay that price, my pacifist morals aside.
Are you joking or serious? Seems appealing but also likely to cause health problems
Yeah, and it was during the last years of Don't Ask Don't Tell, so I couldn't even tell people I was queer or trans.
this is possible, but DO NOT DO IT. it causes HORRIFIC health problems, including but not limited to nasty infections and necrosis. it‚Äôs also extremely painful all the time and takes a long time to actually work. please don‚Äôt do this. it can and may kill you.
During the time period I think you mean (06 -09 ish) I was friends and semi-dated a trans woman when we were in college and had NO IDEA. She knew I was pan at the time and probably knew I‚Äôd be the best ally ever (didn‚Äôt know non-binary was an option so i was still an egg). She was in the National Guard. It would have been physically unsafe for her if I knew and slipped up around ‚Äúhis‚Äù friends. 

That‚Äôs how I know I could never handle it, she‚Äôs the strongest person I‚Äôve ever met.

I haven‚Äôt spoken to her in a long time, hope she‚Äôs doing well!!

You can it for a while but realize eventually it's gonna come out so pick a time where'd you feel more comfortable. In my experience, definitely better to come out then to have people, especially family, unexpectedly bring it up/confront you about it."	vqtbb2	trans	20	0.95	2022-07-03 22:57:07
Is Oregon trans friendly	Just ur silly little Texas escapees ü§ô I know they‚Äôre pushing for a bill protecting gender affirming care, but how likely is that to pass, and how likely is Oregon to stay a safe place. I need somewhere I can crash for 1-2 years before moving out of country and Oregon would be ideal but I can certainly keep looking.	"any of the west coast states are ""mostly"" good. the rural areas can suck, but there are explicit protections in state law for us.
Portland is good, the surrounding areas can be very anti well Portland. But it's an amazing city with tons of love and resources for trans people. Like my street has tons of pride flags on it. Also your an hour from the beach and an hour from the mountain. But be prepared to not pump your own gas.
Yes from what I heard, Oregon is trans friendly. Bubtif you want a state that has actual laws to protect trans people? Washington is number one, which is where I live. Basically yes, Oregon is safe. Idaho isn't though!
I live in the not-portland part of oregon, and we're kinda half rural half yuppie here. Working for a section of local government, we all have nametags with our pronouns, and even the bigwig higher ups sign their emails with their pronouns. That's just my very-public facing section of tiny local government, but the fact that all my bosses back me up vis a vis having non standard pronouns is pretty cool. 

We're also a safe state for abortion rights and just elected a lesbian governor after having a bisexual woman governor for years, if that gives you a better view of the general state of politics here.

Just stay away from eastern oregon, be alert in mixed company per usual, and you should be gucci! :]
Oregon is good i live here. Our free Healthcare covers so much. I have heard Washington is better though in terms of protection.
I live in Southern Oregon. I rarely experience any overt transphobia. I've a (trans woman) friend who recently moved here from Texas. She says it's much better here.

Edit: There's that one transphobic coworker. He hates everyone. He just hates me more. Fortunately, he understands company policy and pretty much keeps his mouth shut (there are lots of nonverbal microaggressions)
Oregon is very trans friendly if you‚Äôre in the valley. Eugene/Springfield, Corvallis, Portland. Otherwise it‚Äôs redneck and bigoted everywhere else. Over half of the state wants to secede to Idaho cause they hate how we have been a blue state for nearly 40 years
Portland is okay. If you‚Äôre in SE Portland I feel the safest . Around 60th and until the river. But when I do have issues it‚Äôs always where the money is at, Pearl/Slabtown. I used to live down there, and it just different now. Probably cause new money is down that way. Once the new Ritz opens in May I think SW will get more conservative. Lived here all my life and it‚Äôs more performative more than anything. I‚Äôm relatively ‚Äúpassing MtF ‚Äù but have an adams Apple still. And always get the points and clock, ‚Äúhe‚Äôs trans‚Äù bs. While eating out in the area with friends minding my business.  Portland is turning into something different.
Mostly, sometimes not, but I‚Äôve very rarely feared being around others for being trans, even walking in the middle of the night in Eugene.
I would echo what most folks have said, it‚Äôs more trans friendly around the larger cities. And as someone mentioned OHP covers most trans affirming care. CareOregon specifically has a trans health coordinator that can help with that stuff.
The Safest state is the State of Mind. We have to get involved in the narrative to break the illusion of a threat to others. We can‚Äôt run forever
As a resident of the oreagon, ive found ashland in particular to be very queer friendly...however its all expensive as fuck to live here
The city of Portland does have many resources for trans people. I lived there for a few years. I felt safe within the city. It mightHowever its a small city and you might get bored and venture out to the rest of the state for some activity during months with better weather. I would be careful when outside of the city. Also i would say you‚Äôre an hour away from sandy but thats not a real beach. Thats a river. A real coastline beach is at least a 3 hour drive during non peak weather.
Being anti-Portland is a thing, independent of left/right politics. Portland pretty much acts as if it is the state of Oregon.
Thank you for the POV of not Portland. I've been in Portland for a while now and it seems like going 20 miles in any direction is the deep south. Glad that is a misconception
I‚Äôm actually talking to a surgeon in Oregon rn!!! It‚Äôs crazy how much easier it is to get in contact with someone over there vs the south
""over half the state"" they get 2-5% whenever it comes up for a vote.
Do you have any pointers on the most affordable county/city? I don‚Äôt plan on moving all the way to somewhere like Portland so I‚Äôm hoping there‚Äôs a little fluctuation towards the southeastern part of the state.
Yes. Over half of the state. It‚Äôs common knowledge that big cities usually are the majority of votes. Especially in Oregon. The valley is pretty much the majority voters. But the rural voters take up more physical land than big cities.
Uh ya, bandon if i remember correctly is somewhat cheap. Quite right lean though. Medford is the most affordable out of the 4 rogue valley towns being the southern ""big"" city (will warn you though, pheonix is just overall better than medford while still being somewhat affordable, litreally just the run down suburbs of medford) eugene is pretty cheap as well, compared to other states cities bend might be an option but for locals its a bit rough...price hikes and all. And salem ive heard is affordable. Pendleton or coos bay are also an option but with a pop of around 16000 for each of them theres not a lot to do in each.

In all id recomend medford as the housing market it right at the national avrage, it has a lot of health instatutions, is pretty dirty compared to the rest of the towns in the rogue valley but has the most things to do in said valley with movie theater, shopping malls, oh ya and direct bus routed everywhere even to the other nearby towns. And during late spring/summer its close enough to go and visit ashlands shakespear festival however one thing to worry about is the smoke. To make a long story short calis fire smoke sometimes leaks up into the valley leading to near unbreathable air during late summer / early fall. it can also get quite hot during the summer and only expect like 1 rainstorm a year
land does not vote.
This seriously helps so much üôè my fianc√© and I can‚Äôt thank you enough ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I‚Äôm not sure what your getting at. But those areas that are majority conservative are actually very close to getting the votes they need to make movement on it. So obviously üôÑ land does not vote but rural voters take up more land than the voters packed into a city like Portland. And Portland or any other blue counties aren‚Äôt the ones voting on if the other eastern counties can secede or not

Trans Day of Visibility is for YOU, even if you're questioning or not out yet.	"This is for EVERY TRANS PERSON WHO‚ÄôS NOT OUT YET, but also so cis people can understand what a double-edged sword it is. 

This post is also known as THIS IS NOT FOR YOU aka GATEKEEPING aka AM I TRANS ENOUGH. By which I mean the kind that others do, directed at us, but also of the kind that we do to ourselves.

I was fairly sure I was trans for a long time, but I knew I couldn‚Äôt transition until a certain date, so I took my time exploring things and figuring myself out. That doesn‚Äôt mean I was any less transgender, though. I‚Äôve been trans my whole life.

If you‚Äôre trans you‚Äôve always been trans and nothing can change that (just like you cisgender folks can probably realize there‚Äôs nothing in the world that would make you suddenly not cis). It‚Äôs just who you are.

And so for a long time, things like Trans Day of Visibility were really painful for me. Because here is a thing that was SPECIFICALLY FOR ME, and yet it was NOT FOR ME because as far as the world knew I was just a cisgender man.

That was so, so difficult to deal with. I‚Äôd see opportunities for trans writers‚Ä¶ people who wanted to read us, help us get staffed or get our projects in front of the people who could make them happen, and there was nothing I could do about it.

I had to watch those opportunities dissolve because they were NOT FOR ME, even though they WERE FOR ME! And I really never needed that extra pain on top of all the pain that gender dysphoria already brought me. 

It‚Äôs a special kind of hell seeing a thing meant to help you that you cannot get to. I couldn‚Äôt even celebrate pride month, because again as far as the world knew I was just a straight guy. I mean I could have said I was bi, but that felt like lying. It‚Äôs ladies for me, thanks.

It got to the point where, in the months before I came out, my wife and I were saying we were a ‚ÄúLGBTQ+ writing team.‚Äù Which is true, if suuuuuuuuuuper vague, but it was the best I was comfortable with at the time.

After coming out that bit got easier, obviously, but a new problem presented itself. And it‚Äôs one I‚Äôve heard echoed by a lot of trans people I‚Äôve talked to: AM I TRANS ENOUGH?

I had this‚Ä¶ this GUILT, I guess, at calling myself transgender. Even though I CLEARLY AM. Because Trans Person A did X thing, and I didn‚Äôt. Trans Person B did Y thing and I don‚Äôt want to ever do that.

So am I even ‚Äútrans enough‚Äù to call myself transgender? Am I disrespecting and denigrating the people whose dysphoria is worse than mine? I mean hell, mine never came with the severe depression that so many experience.

And what‚Äôs even worse is that I‚Äôve seen this kind of attitude from some trans people. There are those who say you‚Äôre not ‚Äúreally‚Äù trans if you don‚Äôt get bottom surgery, or if you‚Äôre not on hormones, or if you don‚Äôt do X, Y, or Z.

I don‚Äôt know how much that contributes to the feelings of not being trans enough, for me. I never bought into that bullshit but who knows about all the little ways these things can affect us that we might not even realize.

I‚Äôm sure it impacts some others, though. Imagine a trans person just beginning to explore what being trans means to them and wanting to transition, and seeing those things and feeling they wouldn‚Äôt be accepted if they didn‚Äôt conform to some arbitrary standard.

It‚Äôs kinda horrible. I‚Äôm a member of a lot of different trans communities and a lot of them are wonderful and affirming and supportive. But in some I can see cliques forming, and it saddens me.

And it‚Äôs such a complicated thing, because trans people have spent our entire lives feeling excluded, and left out, and like we‚Äôre not part of things. So once we get to be included, there‚Äôs this feeling of wanting to keep it closed, to keep it safe.

Which is of course SUPER important with the amount of harassment we often face. But think about how those who are excluded feel‚Ä¶ you‚Äôre accepted into this community, but only so far. You don‚Äôt get to be part of all of it because someone else hasn‚Äôt decided you can be, yet.

And that really sucks, doubly so after never feeling like you belonged or had anyone to talk to about all these weird feelings you were going through in trying to figure out your gender and whether you wanted to transition or not.

And that can definitely play into (or exacerbate) the feeling of not being trans enough, even if unintentional. And that breaks my heart. I don‚Äôt want anyone to ever have to feel that way. We‚Äôve been through enough.

But there‚Äôs another aspect of Trans Day of Visibility you may not have realized, the aforementioned double-edged sword. We NEED to be seen as who we really are, and have our rights and autonomy respected. But being more visible puts you more at risk.

Coming out wasn‚Äôt an issue of safety for me, at least as far as my immediate home life. And I live in California, where I'm respected for who I am. But for so many others it‚Äôs dangerous. Even if not in their immediate household, all the states trying to legislate us out of existence is terrifying.

A reminder (though damn, I hope you don‚Äôt need to be reminded) that there has been more anti-trans legislation introduced in THREE MONTHS in 2022 than there was in all of last year, which held the previous record. It‚Äôs unprecedented and horrific.  
[https://www.themarysue.com/why-are-there-so-many-bills-targeting-trans-kids/](https://www.themarysue.com/why-are-there-so-many-bills-targeting-trans-kids/)

Can you imagine trying to come out under these conditions? Why it almost seems like Republicans want to make it impossible to do so. But news flash: that won‚Äôt stop people from being trans. You can‚Äôt force people who make you uncomfortable to change their gender, pops.

So this is for all the people who are questioning, idly or actively. It‚Äôs for the ones who aren‚Äôt sure if they‚Äôre trans enough, or if they can or should come out, or if things meant for trans people are also for them.

I‚Äôm here to tell you YOU‚ÄôRE TRANS IF YOU SAY YOU ARE. 

NOBODY KNOWS YOU BETTER THAN YOU. 

There is no ‚Äúenough‚Äù to being trans. Whether you want every surgery you can get, or only some, or none. Or all the hormone replacement therapy, or only some, or none. 

If you can‚Äôt come out for any reason, you‚Äôre still trans. Whether you only want to transition socially, or can‚Äôt (or don‚Äôt want to!) transition at all: YOU ARE STILL TRANS IF YOU SAY YOU ARE.  
If you want to come out, I believe in you and you can do it when the time is right. If you can‚Äôt, that‚Äôs okay too. If you‚Äôre just questioning and unsure, that is also okay! You‚Äôre wonderful and valid and can and should be exactly who you want to be. Who you ARE.

I see you. And you are enough."	"God I'm really feeling this right now, I really only figured myself out recently, so the feeling of belonging isn't quite there for me just yet. Hell, even commenting here has taken a lot of courage
It's definitely tough at first, but know you've already taken such big and important steps to becoming the true you. Go at your own pace, and don't let anyone tell you what you do or don't have to do. It's all up to you, and what you discover is right for you.

Fed up with bathroom bills?	OK conservatives.  If having a penis means you don't belong in public restrooms because you might rape someone, then carrying a gun means you don't belong in any public space because you might murder someone.  Can we at least agree on that?	"What if I took a dildo and converted it into a gun?  Would I be allowed to use the bathroom?
I started a thread about this in /austin a couple days ago and it did not go well. 

We have a law that designates all public single occupent restrooms as gender neutral but it's not enforced!

No, but you'd be allowed to shoot the urinal cakes.
/austin is a cesspool
I think OP is suggesting that possessing something that can be used as a weapon doesn't mean that you're intending to commit criminal acts. In this instance, having a penis doesn't make you a rapist any more than owning a gun makes you a murderer.
aww hellz yes
well it is hard to murder someone if there are no bullets in the gun, missing a trigger, and the barrels like a wet noodle. And you wish you had a holster instead of a gun.
TIL: A penis is a gun.
You could bludgeon them to death with it.  Well, if you were strong enough and/or got lucky.  I guess you could theoretically rape someone orally with a flaccid penis?"	2yp44b	trans	18	0.78	2015-03-11 17:21:23

I play first person shooters, racing games, adventure stuff. Steep. I have a fair bit on my switch too.
I understand that. I'm working on a small comic, and posting bits of it put a weird pressure on me, so I've gone back to keeping it private until I'm at least almost finished.
Sounds like a lot of fun!
Yeah I get that lol. Also. I just feel like the subject matter is just awesome and I‚Äôve gotten similar feedback from people who‚Äôve seen it so far. I‚Äôm planning on just putting it up digitally when it‚Äôs done. Still might see about getting a few physical copies made‚Ä¶ just in case ;D
Oh I also have switch. I play switch games, PC games and a few on my iPad when I have to take a hand cramp or art block break

Fear and laziness. They're scared of what they don't understand and it's easier justify your own fear with hatred than it is to try and understand someone.
Making things better is going to take awhile. In the mean time, don't read the comments, never read the comments. No good comes from the comments.
I made it a personal policy to never read the comment section. It's simply not worth my mental and emotional energy.
Because YouTube enables it.  They let a nauseating amount of hate speech and misinformation on their site.
don't read those, people are just saying these things because A) they can, B) they're uneducated and probably immature, and C) they're anonymous. I'm betting most of these people would not dare to say something like that in real life.

I‚Äôm going to the Ohio Capitol on Wednesday to speak for trans rights and against their anti-trans bills. Please, I need trans and ally voices to speak out for me to read.	"I received [this image](https://i.imgur.com/G5lG2Ud.jpg) and realized I have the chance to make a difference for Ohio trans lives this Wednesday. The Ohio statehouse is holding three hearings regarding trans issues: HB6 and HB 68, both at 9:30AM. I am currently writing in support of trans people and their autonomous right to medical care.

For those out of the loop, this is the text of the two bills. I will also be attending for SB83, Censorship of Higher Education, but I will be making a separate post for it.

Ohio [HB6](https://legislature.ohio.gov/legislation/135/hb6) will specifically target trans women in being unable to participate in women‚Äôs sports entirely. While it is more lenient than other bills of this nature, it only holds the door open for more down the road.

Ohio [HB68](https://thebuckeyeflame.com/2023/02/23/ohio-republicans-introduce-bill-to-restrict-gender-affirming-care/), which this link explains in-depth, restricts the treatment of trans youth. Additionally, and most do not notice this, it bars *anyone* from receiving gender-affirming treatment of any kind through Ohio Medicaid.

I need voices. I plan to stand and present for the floor on Wednesday, but I want to hear from you‚Äî were you a trans minor at one point? Are/will you be affected by bills of this nature? Are you an ally who is disappointed that this is what your tax money is going towards instead of meaningful causes? Want to help?

My grandmother told me to wait till she dies to transition. What should i do? (FTM)	"TW for transphobia

A year ago i came out to my grandmother. I had socially transitioned before that (I've been out for about 5 years). She immediately went on a rant about how ""she doesn't care if I'm as gay as a 2 dollar bill."" Because her daughter (my aunt) is gay.

(she also sent her to conversion therapy in the 80's, but that's a different story.) She then sat me down. looked me dead in the eyes and told me ""You have to wait till i die to transition, because grandpa cant take it, and i cant lose my little daughter"" At the time i said it was fine and ill honor her wishes. But as im seeing her for thanksgiving today i am immediately fueled with rage. How could she say that to me?

Would she rather have a dead grandkid or one that's so unhappy in his body that he suffers 24/7 just to make her comfortable.

How do i tell her my name and pronouns inset optional? Please help me.

Thank you all :)

tldr : Grandma told me to wait till she dies to transition, i see her today and im now realizing how messed up that is. what do?

&#x200B;

edit : Thank you all for the supportive comments :D i am taking your advice <3"	"do it anyway. they can't stop you. 

i mean the other option is a little too morbid...
Implore her to die faster or simply not follow her vile requests.
Her generation fucked so much up for us, the least they can do is treat us like humans as we are. 

Fuck their feelings, they don't give a shit about ours.

Live your life, if it makes others uncomfortable, that's their problem to deal with.
This is basically how I put it when a relative told me the same thing years ago; I need to be able to look forward to this to have hope for my future, and if I have to wait until you die, I can't look forward to it without thinking about you dying. Please don't put me in a position where it's either have no hope for my future or have to have that hope tied up in your death because I can't handle that. 

I was also able to put some distance for a few years until the relative I mentioned decided she wanted me in her life more than she wanted to get her way. I don't know if you're in a position to do that and it's a gamble whether the other person will come around. 

(It's not fair and it's cruel for her to have told you that and you shouldn't have to do the heavy lifting here, but if you need to play nice/ keep some kind of relationship going I wish you luck. Coming from a place of love might get through but it might not, either way her behavior is reflective of her, and you absolutely deserve better.)
Your mental and physical well being is worth more than her feelings and outdated, bigoted views. ü§îü§∑üôÑ
That is SOO selfish. I'm sorry. f that live your life
lmao fuck your grandma and make her life miserable what a bitch
My grandma told me the same thing. It hurt a lot, and I almost even considered halting my transition until she wouldn‚Äôt be able to see it. I felt too much guilt. 
But, I soon realized that I do not need to pause my life for anyone. This is my life, not hers. She has no control of me or my choices. I know what will make me happy and I know what is best for me. So, I followed through with that mindset, and yesterday I took my first dose of testosterone. 

So, basically what I‚Äôm trying to get at is exactly what other commenters are saying as well. Live your life. Live it to the fullest and live it as your true self. Don‚Äôt let anyone stop you.
Transition, family means nothing if they don't accept you as you. You'll be much happier in the long run, trust me.
I don't think a woman who sent her daughter to conversion therapy has any right ti tell you how to love your life. Tell her this is how you're going to live your life and if she insists that you can't do it till she's dead you tell her she better hurry up then cause you're not waiting.

I'm so scared	I'm terrified of all the legislation being passed against us, the don't say gay bill was just not acknowledging we exist, but I just found out about the genital check bill passed in Ohio, and it's so real now, like they're willing to pass bills that are massive violations of rights, this doesn't affect me, but maybe the next one will. I'm scared of how far it will go, I'm closeted for now, and considering staying that way forever because of these bills, but that's exactly what they want.	"Same comrade, though I aim to come out at some point. The closet is hell. 

&#x200B;

Though in all honesty it's been real for a long time. This is why I've been saying we're at war.
I know it‚Äôs not always a possibility or an easy option, but I do recommend finding the nearest safe state possible and moving. Even if it takes time and unfortunately a lot of money it will be easier for you in the end
it‚Äôs definitely scary, but at least with the ohio bill, it hasn‚Äôt fully passed yet!! it still has to go through our senate and governor and there‚Äôs a decent chance it‚Äôll get shot down. there‚Äôs a huge wave of resistance from the ohio people
I‚Äôm so glad that I live in California‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs expensive as hell to live here, but LGBTQ+/Human rights seem to be safe here for now.
We all have real cause for concern given the speed with which they are trying to roll back the progress we‚Äôve made - but it is worth remembering that while they can definitely hurt us, they can never eradicate us. There is no telltale genetic signature, and there is no social contagion. Trans people simply _are_ trans, and we have represented the same proportion of the population across every nation throughout all of history. For over 100,000 years we had no access to hormones (God help us), but we still lived the best lives we could. That‚Äôs what we‚Äôve always done. 

If God truly wants His servants to purge the Earth of sinners and sodomites, then He must force them to play a sick, futile game of whack-a-mole for all eternity. Two thousand years of holy war accomplished nothing but needless suffering, and two thousand years more will return nothing else. No amount of straitjackets, torn rectums, or burnings at the stake will ever tire Adam‚Äôs venerable blood of yet more pesky transsexuals. Their ‚Äúnatural order‚Äù is a paper tiger.

No matter the scale or carnage of their crusade, there _will_ be trans people who slip past them; that‚Äôs just statistics. We may lead miserable lives, given what we must hide from the world - and likely ourselves, too, thanks to the hatred we were taught to hold for what we are. Even if we individually don‚Äôt have the strength to keep going in a world that has no place for us, more after us will. We may never have known there was a single other person on Earth like us, but there _will_ be more. So long as the human race continues to exist, there always will be.

_They can never win._
Oh shit, I read that it passed!

New bill in utah would require trans children to be on hormone treatment to participate in sports		"Just to be clear, this would allow trans girls to play with cis girls, right? If so, I think this could be reasonable, right? Or am I missing something?

So idk if its just mobile being wonky, but this is hard to read. What exactly does it say?
eh given its utah its probably better than it last was. Also i kind of agree with this
Haven‚Äòt looked into it, but if they require hrt they are basically excluding trans children again.   

a) it‚Äòs insane to force anyone into medical transitioning (and this would put *a lot* of pressure on trans and gender-questioning teens).  

b) children usually only get blockers. Not everyone has the resources, confidence or access to hrt before turning 18.  

This will do just as much harm, if not more. I‚Äòm pretty sure if any teens feel prematurely forced into hrt by this and regrets it, they are going to blame lgbt+ advocates for it.  

Also, imagine the toll this will have on trans teens with unsupportive families.

Being trans is exhausting.	" I know the title sounds bad but hear me out. 
I‚Äôm a 16yo trans guy and honestly, being trans is exhausting. 
My family isn‚Äôt supportive and when i was outed, not only my parents did not believe me, but they also made fun of me for it. 
I don‚Äôt have any access to hrt cause i‚Äôm a minor and dysphoria kills me every day. 
I often feel like i‚Äôm faking cause i didn‚Äôt have those signs in my childhood that everyone seems to have, i was told since birth that i was a girl and i didn‚Äôt question it until i was 12/13, when i started developing and hating my body. 
Now that i‚Äôm getting comfortable with who i am, i try to put on some makeup or express myself in a ‚Äúfeminine‚Äù way only to be made fun of from my ‚Äúfriends‚Äù. 
Impostor syndrome makes me think that all this is fake and i could stop being dysphoric if i really wanted, that if as a child i did not cry when people called me a she, i cannot be trans. 
I say to myself terrible things that i would never say to someone else. 
Also, all this transphobic bills are passing and i just don‚Äôt understand why people are so obsessed with our existence. 
I‚Äôm so tired, tired of feeling alone in my transness, of hating myself and not be able to express why, having all cis friends that think it‚Äôs just easy for me, knowing that even if they use my name and pronouns they don‚Äôt see me as a man. 
Some examples of the last one would be, when my girl classmates are changing they always tell the boys to go away or turn around, but they don‚Äôt even think about me, like i‚Äôm not attracted to girls and i‚Äôm not a boy, i don‚Äôt look obv but it hurts to notice how they do not treat me like they treat other boys. 
Everywhere i go people misgender me and i don‚Äôt know how to pass better than this, i know passing isn‚Äôt the most important thing but it hurts to know that i don‚Äôt look enough like a boy. 
I‚Äôm literally 5‚Äô1 and idk why people think it‚Äôs funny to constantly make fun of my height, like i do not suffer every day cause i‚Äôm not tall and cis men are always 6‚Äô0 or more. 
I don‚Äôt understand why i‚Äôm so unattractive, i just know i‚Äôm not the hallway crush of a girl or the boy that people fall in love with just by seeing them, and it hurts, a lot. 
Being trans is exhausting, i feel so alone in this small conservative village and i can‚Äôt talk to anyone about it without having to over explain or feel guilty about feeling like this."	"Its shit my only advice is to work hard with school/ uni so you can get a good job be independent
I get what you mean ‚Äî these experiences are unfortunately rather common.  

I can only assure you that life will almost certainly get better as you get older.  Once you‚Äôre an adult, you will have the opportunity to move to a more accepting environment, and virtually every major city has trans communities and support services that you can turn to if you need further help.  You also tend to get better at coping over time, so the pain will diminish as well.
It sounds like you have a lot on your shoulders, it must be very stressful and exhausting to deal with. I understand how you feel, dealing with dysphoria can be soul crushing and not having people understand or support you can make it feel as if you're alone. You're not alone, as bitter sweet as it is a lot of other trans people understand exactly how you feel. It's good to let it all out and vent. It can help a lot just to talk to other people about all of this. 

Being trans also comes with a long path of gaining self confidence. It is tough but it a process, you might not be able to tell it's even happening in the moment but when you look back you'll be amazed with all the progress you have made. On that note it is possible for your family and friends and classmates to change and grow and learn to support you.

Some things that might ease the pain could be: joining an online game or D&D club, anywhere were you can play a character that more alines with yourself where you can get called different name or pronouns, somewhere you can find community and an escape. You can connect with trans people online. For instance, ""Pseudobro"" on Tik Tok hosts a trans zoom call with people from all over where trans people can make friends and community. 

I know that the all the anti trans legislation is devastating, I feel scared too. But there are people out there fighting for us, there are states that are becoming refugee states, there are people that support us. It's just that louder, hateful people with clumsy arguments can make more noise faster. It's ok to be upset and angry with everything. They want us to disappear, we won't give them the satisfaction. Even if it's just out of spite.
Yeah that‚Äôs what i‚Äôm planning to do but i also feel like if i could transition rn i could just stop some changes in my body that when i‚Äôll be 20 or older i will not be able to stop anymore and i kinda feel hopeless
I hate that this is a common experience, i‚Äôm young and i already have to fight for my place in the world and it‚Äôs so stressful, also feeling hopeless and like it will never get better is something i go through every day, it‚Äôs so tiring and stressful, when i first started to understand that i‚Äôm trans i would cry every night feeling like a failure and wishing to be cis, it got better growing up but sometimes i still feel like this and i am so ashamed of it
Thank you so much for your comment, it‚Äôs hard being trans and a lot of people say it‚Äôs beautiful (which it is) but at the same time it comes with a lot of problems, i‚Äôm tired of feeling alone and being a political debate, im trying to be strong for myself and my brothers and sisters that couldn‚Äôt. 
Thank you again for your kind words
I felt the same around puberty. I wasn‚Äôt independent til i was 26 im now 27 and 4 months on hrt. Its hard.
I'm really sorry you're going thru this.  But it's true.  It does get easier when you're able to live independently.  The challenges will still be there.  The difference is you can make decisions for yourself and build a network of supportive friends.  You have 2 years or less until that's a possibility.  That will go by fast.  My advice to you is work your ass off.  Get good grades.  Get accepted to a good school in a liberal place.  Do everything you can to tilt the odds in your favor.  Develop an attitude that you will not be denied.  Be persistent.  If you do those things you can overcome any challenge.  Best of luck to you.
As @EmilyAlt70 says, you just need to hang in there as best you can for the next few years, while you prepare for the next phase of your life.  It‚Äôs all up from here.
yeah i might start hrt when i‚Äôm 26/27 too, with all the therapy that i need and the long waiting list for surgeries i‚Äôll probably have to wait even longer, i‚Äôm happy that you‚Äôre 4 months on hrt tho!
Thank you a lot for this, i‚Äôm trying so hard to get good grades and just be able to move out and transition as soon as possible, i love being me but it‚Äôs also hard and sometimes scary, i hope that everything will get better as i get older"	11mzbqk	trans	15	0.86	2023-03-09 18:15:00

Advice for debates with transphobes TW: hate crime/bigotry	"I'm queer but cis, and last night I had a debate that became outrightly transphobic.

I was in a pub having a good natured chat. He's an acquaintance (we say hello in pubs or on the street) in his 60s. He brought up the topic of Brianna Ghey, and he said he was confused. I'm currently not engaging much with current affairs to protect my mental health and avoid burnout, but I consider myself an ally, and suspected that transphobia was about to be revealed.

He asked me whether the victim was a girl or a boy. I said I didn't know much about the story (only snippets as I go about my day) but my guess was that the victim had transitioned M2F and this was a hate crime. He was astonished, and pressed me to explain. I think his confusion came from her being young and 'passing'. He pressed me for details, mostly about genitals. I said it's not appropriate for adults to scrutinise what genitals a murdered child may or may not have.

When he realised that this girl probably used our national health service to transition, he was further astounded. He asked me how it was acceptable for someone 'mentally ill' to waste taxpayers money for this, when it denied deserving people the treatment they need.

I did my best, but hearing this really knocked the wind out of me. I knew it was bad, but didn't realise HOW BAD the common perception of trans people is. This man I spoke to is a friendly and popular man, not not known for bigotry of any sort. I'm not defending him, but I could easily find someone more inclined toward bigotry in my small town. I can see the scale of the challenge.

What can I say to people in future in response this argument that trans people are wasting resources by making the state foot the bill to indulge their fantasies?"	"Most arguments will have zero impact.  However, the last bit about wasting state money, the simple response is that as we are all expected to be contributing members to that fund, it is for us all to use for our individual unique health needs following best medical practices.  His needs may be considered wasteful by someone else not plagued by his particular health conditions, but it is immaterial to the right he has, as a contributing member to receiving the needed medical benefits.  Same for everyone else.  No ifs, ands, or buts.  Thankfully access to medical treatments isn't limited by the medical knowledge of the average citizen and he should be thankful for that.
I've encountered a few situations like this and more often than not the problem is just lack of education on the matter. 

What I usually do is start by asking them what they think a trans person is and get them to explain what they believe it means. It's easier to educate if you can see where they are misinformed.

Then I like to bring up studies using brain scans of trans and cis people. Cis men and women typically have different trends in terms of volume of grey matter in certain areas and how they process certain stimuli. These studies have found that trans men's brains much more closely resemble cis men's and vice versa for trans women and cis women.

Once you've explained a little bit about the brain stuff (this helps with the people who think trans people are just delusional) I go on to explain how this effects me and what it's like so they can empathise a little. That usually sounds something like this: 

""My brain wasn't wired to have the genitals I have. The disconnect that occurs because of this is a scientifically recognised and often debilitating, life-long medical condition that is caused by my body and yet presents through mental health symptoms. This condition is honestly soul destroying, it affects almost every aspect of my life and the best treatment we have is mitigation of the symptoms, not a cure. Despite this, every single step I've taken in transitioning has made an astronomical difference in every aspect of my life and makes me wish I'd started sooner. Trying to pretend that I'm not a woman for 20 years was by far the most damaging and poisonous thing I have ever gone through; recovery is still a daily struggle.""

I then finish by letting them know that if they have any questions about the experience or anything like that then they are free to ask me:) being the bigger person in these situations and trying to educate people usually has a good outcome and if it doesn't then the person isn't worth your time:) people usually do better when respectfully educated and given the chance to understand
I said something similar to this. I said the treatment of smokers for COPD and lung cancer: the textbook example of 'self-inflicted illness', could be considered wasteful to many. He (a smoker) said that smokers had more than earned their right to treatment through the taxes they had to pay to buy cigarettes and tobacco. 

I said by his logic everyone in the UK should smoke and we can save the NHS and stop the nurses strikes with change to spare. This made the barmaid laugh, and I used it to change the conversation, but I want to be more resolute with my arguments next time. I'm good at convincing people, but even if I can't do that I like to expose people to other opinions. 

Thanks for reaponse
Also that last bit was so well put, thanks! Will use that.
Thank you so much for this!

I'm going to look into the research and fill my head up with information so I can explain to people what transgender means respectfully.

I'll be honest and say that I used to avoid debates around trans issues due to the only trans ally I knew personally was erm... quite a 'strong presence', and I felt judged when the topic came up and I showed my ignorance.

I don't want to be that person. I want to be the person who can help others understand. Belittling people will never work.

It enables the revocation of license for anyone who provides or enables gender affirming care for someone under 18. It passed the senate yesterday and now goes to the house, which overwhelmingly passed a trans sports ban the same day. The governor has used veto against anti trans bills in the past and we can hope that she does the same here and they don't get the votes to override.

As for what you can do, I'm not aware of any protests but supporting those as you can when they happen helps, you could also try writing to the governor to express concern as a neighboring citizen, not sure if that'll do anything but it's not nothing.

I feel really unsafe and hopeless living here and watching this happen, but can't afford to leave yet.
Just shred them before the law goes into effect
I live in Kansas. There's unfortunately quite a few anti trans bills making their way though the legislature. The only ray of hope is Governor Laura Kelly has made it clear she will veto any of these, and the legislature lacks the votes to override the veto. 
It sounds like whatever officials were visiting were putting on scare tactics. Absolutely disgraceful. If your daughter got their information, I would encourage her to call their superiors about this. I'm not an expert in medical law or anything, but this seems like a drastic overreach.

EDIT

I've done some cursory googling, and I can't find any medical records bill coming up. I work in local news, and I'm almost certain I would have heard about this. OP, I have to say again, please encourage your daughter to contact whoever came to her office and demand answers. There's no such law in the pipeline. If she's not comfortable doing so herself, DM me and I can get her in touch with someone at my work.
What happened to confidentiality?
Doesn't that violate HIPAA laws? The state should have no right to access anyone's personal medical records without the explicit consent of the patient, ESPECIALLY if no serious crime is being committed.
Wow this is unnerving. Even if the governor vetoes it, it‚Äôs scary that government officials are trying this before any law is passed. Baaaaaad vibes

possible trigger warning for mentions of hate speech

long story short, like anyone claiming they are ""saving the children"", this bill has such more insidious intent. That's why the leading democrat on it is working with [known transphobe marsha blackburn](https://tennesseelookout.com/2022/10/21/u-s-sen-marsha-blackburn-headlines-anti-transgender-rally-in-nashville/). that's why the heritage foundation stated [they will use KOSA to censor](https://www.heritage.org/gender/commentary/how-big-tech-turns-kids-trans) twitter, tumblr, tiktok, wattpad, youtube, practically everything. earlier this month, 90+ human rights orgs, lgbt, and tech orgs [signed onto a letter](https://cdt.org/insights/coalition-letter-on-privacy-and-free-expression-threats-in-kids-online-safety-act/) calling on senators to oppose this bill. in retaliation, 230+ health and ""for the children"" orgs [signed onto a letter](https://twitter.com/APA/status/1602392617282568206) urging senators to pass it. they include groups like NCOSE (formerly known as morality in media, that rebranded as an ""anti-sex trafficking"" organization but still holds the same far-right christian fundamentalist leaders, connections, and goal: to eradicate all LGBT content from existence). senators are more inclined to push for this bill because APA is saying it will help kids when it will simply not. they have ignored the LGBT voices overwhelmingly and are only listening to the positive PR

**KOSA will lead to mass censorship and surveillance online of anything the Right doesn't like, because the way it works is that it gives every state attorney general full authority to sue any platform for having anything ""harmful to minors"". you see what is going to happen, yes? (which is why 90+ human rights, lgbt, and tech orgs told the senate not to).** 

the bill has so much positive PR. so so much that it keeps me up at night. we have to fight back, there is no other option if we don't want to get censored out of existence online. the best way to fight back is to CALL YOUR SENATORS and tell them to not put this in the end of year spending bill. 

**Call Chuck Schumer (202) 224-6542**  
**Call Maria Cantwell (202) 224-3441**

**if you need a call script,** [**use this**](https://linktr.ee/stopkosa)**.** there are also petitions and letters you can sign in that same link that take less than 1 minute"	"This is very reminiscent of Russia's anti-gay ""propaganda"" law.
What's further disturbing is how based on a cursory glance and research, there is at LEAST 10 organizations with fundamentalist/anti-LGBT ties:

Global Hope 365

Save Our Children (supported Anita Bryant, known anti LGBT crusader back in the 80s and 90s)

    worthy2
    
    We Stand Guard LLC
    
    Traffick911 (reblogged pro-EARN IT)
    
    Resiliency Foundation

Those have ties to anti-LGBT groups, are following anti-Trans people/senators or ARE anti-LGBT like Exodus Cry.

Realized Potential Inc hasn't been active since 2019.

While there are far too many legit groups in the letter, the fact that there are so many shady groups or ones that haven't been active/don't exist for YEARS puts the credibility of this into question.

What research still needs to be done to counteract anti-trans bills?	"Hi all,

Recently, I've gotten the opportunity to perform scientific research under a high-profile transgender medical activist/doctor who specializes in psychiatry. Research is constantly used as evidence in legal settings, and I was wondering whether there is a lack of research on transgender minors in an area that needs to be addressed? I understand that conservative-dominant legislations ignore much scientific research, but anything can help, even if it is mentioned by a single person. I was thinking of following up on Alabama transgender minors, in addition to tracking socioeconomic and racial disparities in resuming out-of-state treatment or residential movement. However, I wanted to hear more ideas as well as I do not have much direct life experience with being trans myself."	"No amount of research will help. Republicans are fascists and they want trans people dead.
Christian churches are going after your kids and sponsoring these bills / politicians. Along with your usual fascist companies. Like Coca-Cola.
There's actually a lot of research already done on how trans-affirming care lowers suicide rates in trans youth, as well as how devastating transphobia already is to mental health in our youth. Research already shows that VERY few people regret their transition (but that field is pretty new, so that might be a start). There's no ""trans brain"" or anything or some definite markers of being trans in our chromosomes, DNA, genitalia etc. but definitely research on dismantling the gender dichotomy would help (showing that there's little to no difference between sexes etc.) since they help push forward genderless thinking. Plus research that shows how laughably unqualified politicians are would be great, too.
I will suggest research into the sports aspect. To my knowledge, studies are very sparse and with small samples, making them far from significant.

A lot of factors also get ignored in these studies. They never go in depth on reflexes, height gain/loss from HRT and many other small things that are very obscure and unknown by many cis people.
None. There's already enough. People just won't read it anyway.
I didn‚Äôt mean purely for combatting the GOP. Research showing psychological outcomes of bottom surgery and FFS were instrumental in some insurance companies covering them. I was just wondering about any deficits in trans-related research overall. Sorry if I worded my post wrong
No need to apologize, I probably didn‚Äôt read your post closely enough and was already on edge from all the transphobic shit going on lately. From what I I understand there is a lot more research that could be done, though I am not really qualified to determine what those deficits are.

My coming out story!	"Hi all. My name is Aaron(Arynne) wanted to say that I have recently told my parents about my desire to transition MtF. My dad I was scared of the most because I was the first ""son"" he had out of my seven siblings, so naturally I was brought up to take care of my brothers and sisters in a paternal role. I knew as I was growing up, I would always want to engage with beautiful and pretty things. I loved drawing princesses and female heroines like Cardcaptors Sakura and sailor moon. My dad had several relationships because it didn't work out with my mom. Each girlfriend he had ended up dating, they had a daughter I would hang out with and play with dolls. (I even stole some LOL)

One of these particular relationships my father had was a woman with a recently transitioned MtF ex, something that I had never thought was possible in my 9yr old brain. A man could be a woman? I had never gave it a second thought until I had reached adulthood. I had questions but every one made it sound like a big deal,  so I never bothered again.

I found my role models in my three aunts, each time that things were bad with my parents, I would visit them for a place to stay, or advice.¬† Their views on feminism and treating people as they were people and not seeing things at face value really helped shaped my way thinking. The youngest of my three aunts would always visit me on my birthday, something I would look forward to eagerly. They really didn't care what anyone thought about them, and I really appreciated their influence on my life.


I had always felt comfortable around a female presence. They made me feel at ease. I truly felt uneasy when it I was being questioned by my fellow cismales about my sexuality (apparently it's a crime to skin your Xbox360 in cute images of Hatsune Miku). Because of this stigma I had hidden alot of my ""feminine"" interests behind a veil, usually only expressing myself through video games and internet spaces where I could be fine with being myself(Gaia Online helped me a ton in high-school). I've often thought myself as female, how I would experience things in social situations differently. I've thought about myself being a mother and how I would feel so jealous of the bonds that mothers have with their children, even before birth. I would often have fantasies about being a princess and dreamt about the experiences of becoming female in a world where noone knew me. I wanted to ""feel pretty"". I wanted someone to realize I was beautiful. I wanted to be a girl, but never knew back then how to vocalize it.

Fast forward 15 years and I'm a 29 year old `cis male` at a crossroads with my life. I had come out of a second failed relationship and I was staying at a friend's house while I was struggling to keep up with my bills. In my relationship I had experienced my partners dissatisfaction with my lack of interest in sex, eventually resulting into coming out as asexual. I had joined a lgbtq group and had done my research about my gender and sexual preference, and if I had to say what I had experienced when I had realized I was a trans girl masquerading as a cis male, it was like waking up and realizing you were underwater, and all of a sudden trying desperately to swim to the surface. 

--- CW: MILD HOMOPHOBIC AND TRANSPHOBIC CONTENT AHEAD ---

After my realization, I initially tried to tell my gf(now my ex) , and her first reaction was misogynistic ridicule. We have a 3 year old son together and she would tell me that he said ""he was turning gay""and accused me of watching videos of gay men around him. This initially set me off, but we eventually broke up after she started showing me pictures of my son in skirts, while telling me that he was going to ""follow in my footsteps"". I ended the relationship, and moved out. I couldn't handle the stress of an environment where I did not feel safe. When I got out, I felt liberated, FINALLY I could be myself. I scheduled an appointment with my therapist so I can talk about starting HRT, and I have been on a ketogenic diet since January 6th. I've lost 27 pounds, and I have never felt better about myself. 

I came out as trans to my Aunt first, as she works as a hairdresser and talks to people for a living. I was really scared because this is the first time I have even heard of someone in our family going through this before me. She had told me that I shouldn't have to apologize for being myself, and that she had my back even if noone else would. (I cried the entire phonecall after that) I then came out to my dad, who was surprisingly immediately supportive, and had my  younger sister contact me, she offered to teach me how to do my makeup(which I'm totally down for and can't wait).

 In the end I am excited to meet the woman I was yearning to be. If I could do one thing in the past. I wish I could give my younger self a big hug, and tell them that it's ok to be trans. I wish I knew sooner, but life has a funny way of forcing change when it's necessary. I hope to show you guys my goal outfit when it gets here! :3"	"You go girl!
Wow!!!! Thats great, you go girl. I wish my parents/ aunts and uncles were supportive.but my allies are my wife and sister-in-law. I wouldn‚Äôt trade their support for anything.

It has barely been 6 months since I've started transitioning MTF and I already faced my first sexual harrasment yesterday.	It's been barely 6 months since I've been on HRT, and socially transitioned. I wear whatever I'm comfortable wearing, curl and dye my hair, and go out everywhere now without the fear of people judging. I was in the grocery store yesterday, during the billing process, the guy standing behind me (middle aged) came too close to me and grabbed my ass. I turned around, and he told me to go forward. After a few seconds, he hit my leg with his cart, which hurt me, and I turned around again and told him to keep distance, and he apologized to me, and just as I bent down to rub my leg, he grabbed me there again. I just couldn't wait to get the billing done and get the fuck out of there. It was a horrible experience. Now I know that I sound very angry in this post, because I am, but in real life, I've never engaged in a fight with anyone in public, and almost always try to avoid an argument with any stranger, and I regret not calling him out on his actions, but at the same time I'm glad I could reach home safely.

"Bills need to pass two houses of government, and then be signed by a governor before they take effect. Still sucks, yes, but the bill is not yet in effect so your narrative is a bit prematurely panicky.

Edit:  It is important to note here that the NH Governor, Chris Sununu, [vetoed basically the exact same legislation in May of 2022](https://www.wmur.com/article/sununu-veto-parental-bill-of-rights-lgbt-children/40052199) and has also passed (or allowed to pass) several other bills enhancing LGBTQ+ rights in the state.  Yes, he's still a ""Dirty Republican,"" but he's not out to kill us explicitly.
There is an obvious real danger and material harm to trans kids being forcibly outed to non-accepting parents, but this may be a hard pill we will have to swallow. I don't like it one bit, but hear me out while I steel man that case.

The trans panic crowd is gaining the most traction with their thesis that kids are being allowed to transition in school without their parents' knowledge or consent. This is, in large part, how they've been so successful at manufacturing outrage and getting bills passed which basically make being a trans kid illegal for the kid and the parents. 

The absurd hypocrisy here is that they claim to be ""protecting kids"" and ""defending parents' rights,"" while their bills have the exact opposite effect. Bills which are banning \*all\* gender affirming care for \*all\* minors \*will\* not only harm, but kill, many of the kids they claim to protect while giving the parents absolutely nothing they can do about it.

I think we need to call them out on and demonstrate the hypocrisy of their argument while making some hard concessions which address the actual concerns they claim to have. The stance we may need to take is (a) define a standardized clinical roadmap for diagnosing and treating kids who report gender dysphoria, complete with best practices and ongoing studies to refine the process and the medications, (b) recognize that the decision to pursue gender affirming care for minors is the domain of the minor, their parents, and their doctors, (c) the government's only role here should be to ensure that safe, defined practices are followed and to PROTECT THE (trans) KIDS from violence, and (d) any surgical gender-affirming care needs to wait till they're 16 or 18.

Again, the sticking point here will be kids who feel unsafe coming out to their parents, and we should be discussing how to address that. I think that requiring parental consent for medical treatment is a fair compromise, but we should also be creating safe spaces and safe adults for these kids to talk to ESPECIALLY when they feel unsafe with their parents.

One of the things that really disgusts me is that in several states (and growing), providing any kind of gender affirming care to a minor is FELONY CHILD ABUSE. The real child abuse is at the hands of the parents who will beat, scare and repress their kids once they start expressing anything outside of cisnormative expectations.

Oh, and in case you don't already see it THIS WONT STOP AT THE KIDS. They mean to legislate US ALL out of existence. I don't think that we have the liberty of holding steadfast to ideal solutions. We have to be willing to hear the actual concerns being expressed within the trans panic and be open to dialog as to how we can address those concerns. If we aren't willing to make concessions, they will be coming for trans adults before you know it.
I live in New Hampshire. I didn‚Äôt know this was happening already. I swear to god if this passes
I don't want people to start jumping the gun, and then getting kicked out, beaten, or mentally harmed. For everyone's safety people need to slow down, and wait this out. Otherwise, were gonna see an influx in my school outed me, if we act like this won't get through. It most likely won't, but we shouldn't just give trust in the idea that our government will pull through and keep us safe.
Sununu is closer to a Corporate Democrat than a MAGA Republican. He really wants nothing to do with the culture war. I really hope he throws his hat in the ring for the GOP Primary. I don't think he will get any traction because he lacks the IT factor and because the Republican base has been overrun by reactionary populists, but I think that the GOP reallllllly needs to be platforming voices of Conservative Sanity.
*If* that bill passes the NH House, *and* the governor signs it. While both are republican led, the majority in the house is super slim and there is a possibility the bill dies there. You say you don't want anyone jumping the gun, then why did you talk as if the bill is already law?

Edit:

Looking at the [State's summary page for the bill](https://www.gencourt.state.nh.us/bill_status/billinfo.aspx?id=1079), I'm not even certain that it passed the Senate.  Since the article you linked is behind a paywall, I can't read it.

Also, don't forget that Governor Sununu once [vetoed the same exact bill](https://www.wmur.com/article/sununu-veto-parental-bill-of-rights-lgbt-children/40052199), just last year.

All hope is not lost.
Jumping the gun was most definitely the wrong term for what I meant, but I should've wrote, ""I don't want people coming out at school assuming it's a safe place, only for this to come out, and screw so many people over""
Sure, but absolutely nothing has changed between two days ago and today.  The bill is not yet law.  It still has to pass a closely divided House, ***and*** get signed by a Governor who ***vetoed the exact same bill last year***."	11tntsr	trans	13	0.72	2023-03-17 10:59:42
vent bc of transphobia in another sub	"My friend and I were playing Borderlands the Pre-Sequel. I asked to play because I haven't been doing well mentally as of late. He suggested I draw human Claptrap to which I agreed. I am trans ftm, please keep this in mind moving forward. Throughout our vc, he called me by he/him and Liam. I am very dysphoric about my voice so calls are very hard for me. At some point, his cousin enters the room. He comments on my voice, saying I sound like a kid. No big deal. Then he calls me she/her. My friend politely corrects him, and he says he doesn't believe I'm a guy. I laugh it off nervously, and the call ends shortly after.

So, I decided to draw Claptrap being supportive for comfort, sort of as a vent. I post it on the subreddit, no big deal. Except compared to my Pickle- a widely hated character- the upvote rate is extremely low. I get someone commenting saying not to be ""political"" and talk about trans rights on a Borderlands subreddit. The post itself specifies WHY I drew this the way I did.

I don't think talking about trans people should be considered politcal. It's sad that it is. I drew this for comfort, and the fact people are shitting on it because of that is really upsetting to me. I just now came to the realization that a fandom very dear to me is transphobic and it hurts. More comments keep flooding in.  I don't know what to do. I just want to cry. Already am, for that matter. I've already had two breakdowns today- neither related- but this is just making it worse. Not to mention I live in Alabama. Recently two new anti-trans youth bills were passed.

I've just been feeling really shitty lately. I just wanted to share art of my favorite character being supportive for comfort. I cant even do that. Debating deleting the post bc it seems to be hurting me more than helping. I may post the art here if anyone is curious about it.

Holy cow. I live in AZ, and I had no idea.
Just as a reminder, those __without__ pro-trans bills are just as bad as those with anti-trans bills.
Damn, didn't know Michigan gave in on the high school sports thing. Pretty disappointed, ngl
Hmm, looking at that tracker, I only see WA listed once, and it's for a pro trans bill, not an anti trans bill. Same with Hawaii. I'm not sure how accurate that map is."	sp6s5j	trans	13	0.93	2022-02-10 13:35:33
Trans diaries: BATHROOM BILLS DON'T WORK (#003) tw: transphobia	"[(#000)](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/mt0qdd/trans_diaries_hi_000/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) [(#002)](https://www.reddit.com/r/trans/comments/mttq68/trans_diaries_mum_doesnt_like_my_name_002/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

\[Sorry for the rant, I just need to vent - tbh that's what 'trans diaries' is for\]

The whole 'bathroom debate' is stupid. And not just because of the transphobia. Or needless segregation. Or whatever. It's also stupid because, at it's very core, *the logic. does. not. work.*

For the sake of argument, let's say that the TERFs are correct in their assumption (they're not, but let's pretend) that accepting and normalising trans people will let predatory cis men claim to be trans women, to be let in to women's bathrooms.

If that is the case, then with the current solution (segregating bathrooms by AGAB) there is no way to avoid that problem.

*If trans people are accepted:*

Predatory cis men can claim to be trans women, and gain access to women's bathrooms

*If trans people are not accepted*

Predatory cis men can claim to be trans men, and gain access to women's bathrooms

Ok, so what do we do about that? Well (since most TERFs actually just want to harm trans women and don't really seem to care about trans men) trans men could just stay in the men's bathroom, right?

Well that would still put some trans men in danger. Let's, again, for the sake of argument, pretend that young girls really are being tricked into identifying as trans men (again, they're not, but pretend). If they go into the men's bathroom, could that not put them in danger? But if we try to solve that problem, then we run back to the issue of predatory cis men being able to claim they're AFAB and were tricked into being trans so that they're allowed back into the women's bathroom - so now we're *back at square 1*.

There's no way to debate them using their logic. It doesn't work. And once we stop pretending that their blatant lies are actually happening, then the whole thing falls apart even more because *there was no problem in the first place*. 

*They made it up*.

I also personally don't really support gender-segregation at all - I think it just creates more problems (but I'm open to conversation about it!)

tl;dr: TERF logic just doesn't work and only creates more problems"	Beautiful. For years I could not find the words. I stumbled and stuttered, and couldn't put together one sentence even though the emotions were so strong it was stressing me out.

"""Would This Ban Pride? Probably."" Arkansas Anti-trans Drag Bill Passes Senate"		"This is from the same party that claims to be for freedom of speech.
This is one piece in an organized national attempted [genocide. ](https://www.reddit.com/r/lgbt/comments/z7hu00/so_im_gonna_be_making_a_video_essay_about_the/)
Oh boy I can't wait to report all the conservative women who wear pants in any public ""performance""
Except they will never enforce it that way, the same way laws that defined marriage as ""between one man and one woman for the purpose if bearing children"" were never enforced against infertile or child-free straight people.

These laws are about building the legal and social groundwork for classifying sex and gender variation outside cis/heterosexual norms as being inherently sexual. They're working towards making the public existence of trans and gender nonconforming people a sex crime.

The ""drag bans"", the ""bathroom bills"", the attacks on trans youth and now adult's medical care, the attempts to pull information about LGBTQ but especially trans people from public scools and libraries, and everything else they're doing, they're working towards making the public existence of trans and gender nonconforming people a sex crime.

The laws they're trying to pass are so vaguely worded, the existence of trans and gender variant people is being classified as inherently sexual/""adult""/obscene/etc. And if they are able to pass these bans on ""performers"" they are absolutely going to use it to attack us in every other area of public life too.

After all, if someone they consider a ""man in a dress"" is legally classified as an ""adult performer"" when all they're doing is reading Mary Poppins to kids in a library while dressed as the titular character, what exactly does that mean for the person whom they consider a ""man in a dress"" who is just trying to go to her job as a 5th grade Music teacher? Or hell, just trying to go to the grocery store?

They don't actually distinguish between ""drag queen"" and ""trans woman"", or between ""performance"" and ""just going about our lives"". They see trans and GNC people's existence as inherently sexual, and our clothing and gender presentation as the expression of a perverse fetish. If we are anywhere in public where a child might possibly see us, even if it's standing in line at the 7-11, they are claiming that this is pedophilic grooming through forcibly exposing children to degenerate sexual activity.

And they aren't going to fucking stop voluntarily. There is no goddamn line where they will decide they've gone far enough, except the point at which we no longer exist.
based
I understand completely, but there is a much greater chance of it getting overturned if it's being used to implicate cis people in normal everyday behavior. 

Plus it will tie up police resources to the point that they will just stop responding to calls and stop trying to enforce it.

Same with the bathroom bans, just report every single person who goes into the bathroom. Since there are no hard qualifications for someone to ""look trans"" everyone is culpable until they prove otherwise which goes directly against the constitutional screed of ""innocent until proven guilty.""

This is just one tactic in an entire arsenal that must be deployed to fight against and show the absurdity of this unconstitutional attack on individual freedoms."	10l7j85	trans	14	0.93	2023-01-25 19:38:59

HRT + Covid-19 Vaccines and HIV + Covid-19 Vaccines	"I've seen a few Log Cabin Republican posts in my city that Covid-19 + HRT had severe reactions the same with HIV meds + Covid-19 vaccines. That's a scare tactic, up until the day Biden took office they saw the vaccine as ""Trump's miracle cure to get us back to normal"" immediately after Biden came it turned into ""Joe biden's Bill Gates microchipped vaccine of genocidal death"".

First off had no HRT issues with the Pfizer vaccine. Just a bit of a sore arm for a couple of days and not as bad as the tetanus shot.

A friend of mine had minor flu symptoms for a couple days after taking the Pfizer vaccine with HIV meds with a low T-cell count. But it was not severe.

I hope this helps anyone who is on the fence about whether or not to get vaccinated."	"I‚Äôm on HRT and i just had some arm soreness and that‚Äôs it. 100% get vaccinated
Im on hrt and am getting my covid vax in the morning. Am I a good girl? üòî
Scheduled for my 2nd shot on the 2nd! Moderna Class of 2021
Good girl because I've encountered some Log Cabin Republicans using fear tactics telling people the HRT won't work or anti-hiv medicines won't work or worse.

We have to combat this nonsense and threat to our community from our own so that our people are safe. We have to take the initiative since most states are anti-lgbt and won't do anything to encourage LGBT people to get vaccinated.
Most definitely a good girl üíú my suggestion make sure to drink plenty of water before going and eat a little something. You might have some shoulder pain after the shot but it's nowhere as bad as a tetanus shot.
And I was chatting with a medical professional a PhD and she's trans and she's done research and said there is no correlation between the vaccines and interactions with HRT or anti-hiv medicines. I'm glad you're not falling for the scare tactics so definitely a very good girl you have a brain to think for yourself üíú
Good luck üíú I get my 2nd Pfizer in a week and a half
Im definitely not smiling ear to ear at being called a good girl >w> but yeah I drink a ton of water already and I eat 3 meals a day so I should be good.
I tend to just not trust anything republicans say especially with all the anti trans stuff going on recently. I always make sure to ask people who have gotten the shot/are trained professionals then make a judgment xD
And sometimes being a bad girl can be fun too oops TMI

N.J. Senate approves bill to allow transgender people to obtain new birth certificate			1szv31	trans	13	0.88	2013-12-16 08:35:43
"""I don't want to go back to being who I was just to survive"""	"That was the sentence where I started crying tonight. 

For context, I'm 33 years old, transfem, pre-anything-medical, and semi-closeted (most of my friends and my mother know, but I'm still presenting masc at work).

It's been more or less a year since I started finally examining my feelings and my identity. As you might imagine, the fact that I'm starting this old is a point of no small frustration for me, and the state of the country has not been helping.

I had been trying not to obsess over news about the election, but I still found myself checking fairly frequently. As a result I found myself venting my frustrations to a couple of my friends over messenger apps. They tried to be helpful or at least understanding, and one of them made the comment ""you will survive this"".

I've been surviving for 33 years. Surviving to me means nothing more than paying my rent and being able to afford food and bills. And part of surviving until last year has been ""convincing myself I'm a guy so that I can keep my head down and make ends meet"". As of this last year, it has been ""pretend I'm still a guy on my work days so that I can keep paying my bills"".

With the election looking as bleak as it does right now, I'm scared that won't be enough. That things will continue to deteriorate, and that I won't be safe even going outside as myself. That any resources I might seek out for a full transition - planned parenthood, name changes, a new job, whatever - won't be available to me before long.

So when I was later venting about how scary this political landscape is, the only way I could phrase that feeling was ""I don't want to go back to being who I was just to survive"". And typing that out hit hard.

I guess I'm just posting that whole thing here because I needed to explain that somewhere. To type it out and toss it into the digital sea, as it were. I guess thanks for reading if you got this far."	:(	jnsicb	trans	12	0.88	2020-11-04 07:33:06
Protect trans rights. Defend democracy. - Scottish greens statement and petition	"Dear Reddit,

This morning, the Scottish Parliament‚Äôs Equalities, Human Rights and Civil Justice Committee had intended to question the Secretary of State for Scotland, Alister Jack, about his unprecedented decision to block Gender Recognition Reform in Scotland.

In December, the Scottish Parliament passed the Gender Recognition Reform (Scotland) Bill with a more than two-thirds majority, including MSPs from all parliamentary parties. The Committee sought to explore Jack‚Äôs rationale for blocking Royal Assent of this legitimate legislation.

But Jack refused to turn up. And so did the UK Government‚Äôs Equality Minister, Kemi Badenoch. This shows a total disrespect for our parliament and for our democracy. But most of all, it shows a contempt for the trans people who have been under attack for far too long.

Join me in signing and sharing this letter to Alister Jack, and letting him know what you think of his decision.

The precedent his actions have set should concern all of us. The Tories cannot be given a veto over trans rights. We will resist them every step of the way.

Many thanks

Everything is getting easier. Went out with femme clothes today!	"I came out to my group of friends, they are super supportive they kept telling me, ""no one else pays my bills but me"". Live my life how I want to. Found out they're in love with doing make up and etc. I explained to them what I've been going through and my friend told me I sounded alot like her friend who recently transitioned. He told me to take baby steps and do it little by little. One of them even offered to bring me purse shopping!!! Today I went out to eat and to the theaters in my new sweater, they said it was cute, I even wore jeans for women, (pockets will be missed). I WAS SO NERVOUS AND SELF CONCIOUS, but i got over it, it turns out no one cares. They'll look at you and move on with their life. I felt like a person today, i havent hung out like this in a year but today I felt great!!!"	"Im happy it worked out well for you!

Pockets are def a major loss, Im not a huge fan of purses so Im trying to figure out how to carry all my shit (knife, lighter, keys, phone, wallet, eventually gun, and my other odds and ends)  :(

Trans representation in theatre (help)	"I hope this okay to post here. I am a  trans, non-binary performer and director and I have a play at VAULT  Festival (London) using interviews from our communities to disrupt  cisnormative narratives about what it means to be trans and non-binary, and celebrating  our everyday lives. I am so excited that a play centering on trans live  has been chosen for the VAULT Festival programme, but it also feels  alienating as the only play on the bill about trans people.

VAULT  Festival are currently running a competition with Stagedoor in which  the most liked/saved plays on the app will be given a lot of marketing  help, help that we couldn't afford otherwise, and help that would  transform whether people came to see the show or didn't realise it even  happened.

If it is possible, it would  mean the world if you could download the Stagedoor app and search 'Dead  Reckoning' (the name of the play) and save it to your events. That's all  that is needed - you dont have to commit to anything except saving the  event, and it would help get the only trans play on the programme seen  by others. I think theatre is still lagging behind with trans  representation, and we hope just by being at a festival like VAULT we  can play a small role in disrupting that. Any help getting there would  be appreciated by my lil trans heart. Jess (they/them) xx

Not sure if this is the right place to ask, but is there anything we can do to prevent CS/HB 1475 from taking effect?	"CW: Transphobia: [here](https://www.myfloridahouse.gov/Sections/Bills/billsdetail.aspx?BillId=72710) is a link to the bill

The bill is the infamous anti trans bill in florida which was recently passed, it allows genital inspection to prove biological sex. I live nowhere near florida, otherwise i would be at the capitol shouting my lungs out. I've done some digging, and found out how to see who's supported the bill. Even if it can't be prevented from taking effect, is there any way to contact its supporters effectively to at least make them have trouble sleeping at night? I know inducing guilt is a bit underhanded, but so is attacking human rights. I'm a radical anarchist who supports more in person actions, sadly I can't do much on the other side of the country. I am cis so I'm not really affected by this but seeing how this is affecting the mental state of my trans friends is horrible. Any ideas?"	I don't know if this will happen but I figure (and hope) that this *bill* or *law* won't stand up to judicial review.

Help with trans things	Hi y'all, so a month ago today (YAY!!) I came put as trans (mtf) and honestly I've felt kind of alienated. There is so much I don't understand and so much culture I just don't get and when everything I see on tik tok is the anti trans bills it feels so daunting. So of yall could catch me up on some stuff about everything that would be nice. Few key things that I would really like to know: who is Bridget and where is she from, what's the stuff with Celeste and Fallout new Vegas, what's with the shark, and is it normal to feel overwhelmed like this?	"Hi there! I‚Äôm starting E tomorrow myself, and definitely would say it‚Äôs normal to feel the way you‚Äôre feeling, this can all be super overwhelming. Bridget is a canonically trans character from the fighting game series guilty gear, Celeste (I think) is also a trans allegory or the main character is trans. Fallout new Vegas as far as I understand it is just very popular w trans folks but not for any reason I know of besides that it‚Äôs a good game. The shark is an IKEA plush that people really latched onto after some tiktok memes about it
Trans people come from all walks of life, all these references are just bits of culture that we could pretend were part of trans culture. We're just making it up as we go. Give it a shot. Do you like making your coffee a certain way? Well now that you are trans that is an absolutely CLASSIC trans style. Just say it with enough confidence and the rest of us will follow along. Trans culture was literally burned to the ground by the Nazis, make some up to compensate.
I have been wondering about the shark as well. It's cute and adorable, but as a new person to the community I don't know why it's an icon.
Thank you so much and good luck E I hope it goes well!
Thank you, I think that makes a but more sense. Have a good day!
Bahahaha! Totally stealing this!
I love this sentiment!!!!
Its because of the colors of sharks, someone used the colors of the ikea shark to make a trans flag and it became an icon
Thank you and have a pleasant day yourself ü•∞
Thank you, just like op I'm trying to learn these as well but rarely did anyone post questions about them.
Also, Blahaj (the ikea shark) was used to promote LGBTQ+ rights by the company a bit ago. Then we went ‚Äúcomfy cuddle shark, ours now‚Äù‚Ä¶

How do I help a trans friend out?	"My friend is at a dead end. She has Christian parents who won‚Äôt allow her to get HRT. She had an appointment for a consultation, hoping the doctors could persuade her parents to take action, but the texas legislature is in session and a bill was introduced to ban trans kids from receiving gender affirming therapy and healthcare, so the appointment was canceled. She has attempted suicide more than once and plans on starving herself so her parents can agree to finally give permission. 

I feel like a terrible friend. She‚Äôs in pain and there‚Äôs nothing I can do. I‚Äôm 150 miles away."	"Firstly, you're not a terrible friend, and sounds like you maybe be one of the few people she has to lean on for help. My recommendation is just to continue to be there and support her. Introduce her to communities where she can be surrounded by kindness and support like this one. Its most important that she knows she is not alone. We are here, and we are many ü•∞.

You are never at a dead end so long as you are still breathing; there are options and opportunities to find a way out.
[removed]
I really hope that the bill in texas gets screwed over and fails because its disgusting that trans people are literally being bashed and torn apart like this on a governmental level. Its just plain wrong to hate people for just being who they are. Nobody has any right to stop someone from living as who they really truly are. 

Im fortunate that I live in a state with really good trans healthcare and laws. But its sooooo expensive here. My dad lives in Texas good thing im 25 if i ever have to go stay in Texas. Cant stop me from transitioning.

I was peer pressured into coming out as trans	"I can only use one flair, but I think this counts as a possible trigger as well. 


At school, I started using my preferred name and pronouns. I‚Äôm shy when it comes to personal stuff like identity, so I only told close friends who I can come out to through text.

 One of my school friends, A, was asking me about why teachers were using a different name for me. We were at a lunch table with strangers nearby. Along with the people I didn‚Äôt know, some of A‚Äôs friends and a girl who I dislike were sitting at the table. 

They started asking me why I was using a different name, and pressuring me to tell them. I told them I didn‚Äôt want to, but they kept asking. Eventually, I told them. They were confused, and I had to explain the whole concept of being transgender at least 3 times during that 30-minute lunch period.

 They seemed overall supportive, but continued to use my deadname and she/her pronouns on me, even after I corrected them. Obviously I don‚Äôt expect them to be perfect right away, but I had *just* come out, and I was correcting them. One girl, B, said something like, ‚Äúslay queen,‚Äù I am ftm, and told them this. 

After lunch, the girl I dislike, C, started trying to argue with me on how some trans people aren‚Äôt actually trans. I don‚Äôt remember her exact argument, but it was something like, ‚Äúsome people aren‚Äôt actually trans, it‚Äôs just their parents telling them they are.‚Äù She also said something about hormone therapy and other means of medical transitioning being accessible, this was right after anti-transgender bills were passed in our state. 

I don‚Äôt hate these people, they were curious. It made me uncomfortable, and I can‚Äôt stop thinking about it, though. I don‚Äôt want sympathy or advice on what to do, I just wanted to get this off my chest.

*I didn‚Äôt use anyone‚Äôs real name or any nicknames*"	"You're very brave, even if things seem frustrating right now. The only advice I can offer is, just don't waste your breath on people you don't like, or who are weird about you beibg trans.

Good luck out there, things will get easier with time.
I'm ftm and I just cringed reading ""slay queen"". One of my old friends, who turned out being toxic, said that to me A LOT after I told her I was trans. I hinted that I was uncomfortable with it, saying things like ""uh I think you mean king haha"" but it annoyed the shit out of me. She also told me I was gay a lot, even after I told her I like girls and I'm not a girl, I'm a guy so I'd be straight. Her response was ""yeah but you act really gay"". I haven't started T yet but I've been trying to train my voice to go lower. I still use a lot of traditionally feminine speech patterns but I'm working on it. Plus I've lived as a girl my whole life, so it'll definitely take a while before I start acting less feminine. Sorry for rambling, I hope they leave you alone. Best of luck in the future ‚úå

I don't really take any notice of lexicannes.com because so many of the articles on there are absolutely biased and pieces of shit. This journalist hasn't even bothered to figure out the details of the bill instead just spouting ""ITS TRANS HATING"".

Will possibly be annoyed at the bill when better journalist covers it, but for now, will just be like WTFUX article.
The bill IS trans hating and the doctor/lawyer is likely making up stuff hence the reason nobody can truly figure out his logic. I don't understand why you can't ignore writers you don't like or at least give a rebuttal so that we can check your claims.  
How can I rebut when all the article says is ""I don't understand this bill but this bill hates us""?

His dad has had major issues with drugs and alcohol, having gone through rehab and AA multiple times. They lost their job a few years ago and this sent them in to a major downward spiral. 
Now my friends dad is comming out as transgender mtf, I gave suspected it for years. She is now blaming all the problems theyve had on being a closeted trans. She says they cant blam her for any thing shes done because she was suffering. I gave sevr8ak points in this. 

So point one. I wanna call BS on that. Just because you are in the closet dows not mean you get a free pass on being an ass hole. God knows I did plenty of ass hole things befire I had my own realization, my wife will bw happy to lost them for you. This had nothing to do with me being trans it had to do with me being an ass hole some times.  Nothing nearly as bad as my freinds dad, and terry and find some one whos reached their mid 30s with our some ass hole in them.  

Point 2. I was hoping to come out to my best freind at some point.  Would have done it already but his wife is the words biggest gossip and a major terf, so I've been holding off. Now I'm even more reluctant to come out to my freind at the moment cause he seems to think all transgebder people are these ass holes. Just seems to have s negative impression of transgender. I'm hoping this is a gut reaction to the news and ut will fade in time. 

Point 3. I'm torn between being able to connect to another transgender person irl snd the fact that this person is a complete ass hole that I never really liked.  I currently
Have no irl transgender freinds are even know any all and its unlikely I'll be making any soon. I have like no free time, money is tight. Also I am like the worst person in the world at making freinds, it's a skill that's always alluded me. And here is another transgender person I can talk to and possibly relate to, but their such a horrible person in gential, also it would be betraying my freind. It's like I'm a dog and some keeps showing me a treat and pulling it away. 

Point 4. I'm pissed off this person will be starting hormones soon. Its alot easier wheb you have no job and your wife is fitting your bill for your BS life style. And I'm sitting here wondering if or when I'll be able to start cause I have a carrer I actully like. And yeah I'm a little jealous. 


So that's my struggle this morning. 


TL;DR 

My best freinds abusive father just came our as trans mtf. 
 Point 1. My freinds dad is blaming the fact that theyve been an abusive alcoholic and all around ass hole on the fact thats theyve been a closted transgender mtf. And I wanna call BS. 
Point 2. This makes it harder for me to come out because hes got a negative veiepoint/ association with transgenders now. 

Point 3. I'm torn between being able to make a connection with another IRL transgender women, a first for me. And the fact that this person us just horrible person also it would be a huge betrayal to my freind. 

Point 4. I'm jealous as my freinds dad well be starting therapy and HRT soon and I don't know if are when I can."	"Jesus that sucks. Don't feel pressured to be nice to her. End of the day you can be trans and still be an asshole
Just because someone had internalized struggles that they are now facing doesn't wipe clean a filthy slate of externalized abuse. 

If they rehabilitate and stop whatever cycle they are doing that's awesome but if they are still being horrible but excusing away as repressed gender anxiety then they can ""suck it""
Honestly I think you need to recognize that everyone‚Äôs journey is different. I lived my life horribly and treated people badly, but when I came out everyone understood why. It doesn‚Äôt make what they did okay, but it does mean she will likely not do it again. I think you should respect her courage and try to be supportive, because gatekeeping helps no one.
She doesn't deserve forgiveness if she's not willing to apologize. Forgiveness is a three step process:

1. Apologize.

2. Make recompense, which is hard to do for a years-long campaign of shitty behavior, but possible if you become a good enough person.

3. Make a sincere effort to not re-offend.

She's failing step 1. You have every right to continue to be angry with her. She's saying ""Well it's because I was trans that whole time,"" but she still bears responsibility. After all, not every trans person abuses the people around them before coming out. She took out tons of her own internal anger and tension on people around here. No explanation excuses that behavior; it's *wrong.* The very least she could do is say sorry.
I mean, I was an alcoholic while was closeted trans.   Doesnt excuse being abusive, but still reasonable.
Yeah that's the issue my freind is having. Shes done rehab and AA more time then can be counted and shes never asked for forgiveness are admitted shes done any thing wrong.
If she was acknowleging her behavior and apologising it would be one thing (""gee, I can't believe how terribly this all lead me to act!""), but that doesn't sound like the case.  It also doesn't sound like your relationship to her affords you much hope of helping her shape up...

As far as your friend goes, yeah, that sucks.  It sounds like you're of a mind to help him through this without adding something else for him to adjust to?  You could judge how having a better example to balance his parent's behavior might help and how you feel about your coming out being linked to this (even if as a ""good thing,"" nobody should fault you for wanting to come out on your own terms).  His wife sounds like a joy, but she probably wasn't going to be any better if that's how she really is.

Also depending on when ""at some point"" would have been, things may settle down ok?  How is your friend taking the trans aspect of this, when it isn't being used as a ""get out of jail free"" card?  I'd say be supportive, stick up for yourself if he starts down a bad path, and try not to resent his parent so much that it changes your friendship with him.

Best of luck.
This. Explanations do not double as excuses.

Emotional and mental stress of any stripe doesn‚Äôt grant the poor person in the tight spot some blank check to be abusive.

When even WA gets an anti-trans bill.	"Ok. This has gotten so ridiculous with these bills. After reading through HB 1214, I could get a Class C felony for even trying to help my child who is transgender. As a transgender woman myself, I am appalled that there is such a double standard in this country right now. If parents aren‚Äôt told their child is wanting to transition, the school is at fault for ignoring ‚Äúparents rights‚Äù. If parents want to help their kid through transitioning to make sure it‚Äôs done properly and safely with doctors helping, the parents are criminals. 

I, for one, am tired of this flagrant assault on our liberty.

Liberty is defined as: the state of being free within society from oppressive restrictions imposed by authority on one's way of life, behavior, or political views.

If kids have to say the pledge of allegiance and don‚Äôt get the same liberty and Justice for all then the government officials spouting all this hateful rhetoric are no better than hypocrites and tyrants.

Watch me start fighting of the front lines of Justice and love for the sake of our kids futures."	"Parents don't have rights.

Children have rights.

Parents are guides, not owners.
Over 100 anti-trans bills are on the table, with more slated on the docket. The plan is for the really outrageous bills that would never pass anyway to be thrown out, so they have to make concessions for those by allowing the more reasonable ones to be approved. You have a reason to be worried, that's for sure.
Unfortunately the majority of this country is becoming like nazi Germany in its early days when all the trans research books were burnt first. Having our rights stripped away slowly. More people are leaving their home states to move to states where government did not completely lost its shit which will definitely polarize the society even more. If you can take a legal stand, please do. I‚Äôm riddled with ptsd depression and anxiety after my military service here, and crappy childhood in another country and not able to be confrontational any more. My hope that at least the west coast stays somewhat progressive, otherwise I‚Äôll be on my merry way to either Canada or Portugal.
Can you clarify the HB# or the source? The only thing I'm finding for HB 1214 is from last year.
That‚Äôs the hypocrisy of this whole thing. I can‚Äôt help my kid and my kid can‚Äôt help herself if these laws aren‚Äôt removed. I will fight for my child against these anti-trans bills. She will get her future.
It‚Äôs all the fear mongering that is happening by making problems that don‚Äôt exist appear out of thin air and people believing they are really big issues.

When I transitioned in Mississippi, no one was afraid I‚Äôd do anything untoward. It is now as if everyone who is trans is guilty before proven innocent for crimes we never committed.
Like? No‚Ä¶ it is exactly the same. There are 10 stages of genocide and the us is on step 7. It‚Äôs a repetition in history. America is a fascist ‚Äúcountry‚Äù full of nazis.

Ah thanks!

Classic Jim Walsh, what a fuck bag. Thankfully I see this as having 0 chance of making it through the full house (Dems hold a 58/40 majority), let alone the senate where they have a near super majority (29/20). 

But side note: Here's the bill https://lawfilesext.leg.wa.gov/biennium/2023-24/Pdf/Bills/House%20Bills/1214.pdf?q=20230212174134

I hate having to be trans	"Every day i have to deal with constant, unbearable dysphoria and I can‚Äôt do anything about it. I go to an INCREDIBLY conservative school with people constantly telling me ‚Äúyou‚Äôll never be a real girl‚Äù and even calling me the f word WITH TEACHERS RIGHT IN FRONT OF THEM. And they do nothing about it, even after constant reports. I‚Äôve wanted to move to a different school, but that would mean moving homes as well. Everywhere I go, it‚Äôs always ‚Äúhow‚Äôs it going, sir‚Äù,‚Äùwhat‚Äôs up my man‚Äúand everything in between. I‚Äôm never even able to wake up or sit through class without breaking down and crying for at least 5 minutes. I‚Äôve wanted to be able to express myself in public but everyone around me only knows me as ‚Äúthat gay kid‚Äù, stopping me from being able to make new friends. Hell, even my closest friends ended up telling everyone about me without my permission. I‚Äôm also constantly feeling like garbage anytime I see myself or have to acknowledge my body‚Äôs presence. I‚Äôve been trying to at least grow out my hair for a year but it didn‚Äôt grow at all. I‚Äôm also quickly growing a beard and have the lowest voice in my grade (8th) so I can‚Äôt talk to anyone without wanting to throw up. Also, I‚Äôm only 13 so it‚Äôs incredibly unlikely my doctor can do anything unless I‚Äôm really far through puberty. It‚Äôs also one of the only shreds of hope I have for ever feeling happy about myself. Every moment of my life has been plagued with crippling dysphoria stopping me from doing anything. I also decided to go online and see if anyone can relate to me, but all I see is people talking about how incredible their life has been and how much they love their body ever since transitioning. And I am proud of them, but I feel like garbage knowing that so many people are so much happier than I am and don‚Äôt spend their entire day under their bedsheets, crying themselves to sleep just to have some time away from the suffering that is the real world. I‚Äôm also feeling like I‚Äôm going to be outlawed at any moment due to bills stopping trans people from being able to go to whatever bathroom they want and stopping people my age up to 18 or higher from getting hormones or blockers.

TL;DR: my life feels like hell and I don‚Äôt know what to do

Also I‚Äôm sorry if this came off as selfish. I just wanted to vent."	"Your post has been filtered to our queue while we handle brigade issues.

I used to be in a similar situation with acceptance in school, and I was powerless against it all. while I still experience my fair share of bullsh*t I do feel things eventually got better.. Your post isn't selfish at all, in fact I'm glad there's a place were you are able to out those feelings and experiences. everything in the news is depressing right now, and I hate what's currently happening with the laws and everything. You're not alone. somehow we'll survive..
This was honestly really heartbreaking to hear. I'm MTF and almost 22, I am on my path to being more happy with myself. But I still get those crippling thoughts more than once a day. From the sounds of your friends who outed you and the schools' reaction towards you I 100% understand how you feel, that's awful and gross that people treat trans people like that. You are loved and supported and just know that you are strong even if you don't think you are. If these cis people just knew the mental trauma and problems trans people have going through the wrong puberty can do. You can do it. you're stronger than anyone can ever know. I started hrt when I was 20, and yah I compare myself to other trans women, I feel like alot of trans people do that, but you shouldn't let that make you feel bad about yourself you should try to see it as these people who were just like you who got the treatment they need and you will too.
Im a 14 year old (8th grade) MtF as well. I feel the dysphoria. In private I made bras out of underware and stuffed them with socks lol. I have also started wearing a mask and whenever someone asks me why Im wearing a mask I just say its because I dont want to get covid. Depending on how on board you are with your parents you could also get therapy, there are a lot of trans support therapists out there that do zooms and mabye even some free ones for closeted trans if you need. Im sorry for your situation and if you ever need anything/have any questons you can ask me."	12ewvgj	trans	12	0.76	2023-04-07 19:44:09
India introduces new trans rights bill in parliament after backlash			cgawe5	trans	12	0.85	2019-07-22 09:15:58
I‚Äôm scared	"For those of you don‚Äôt know [this](https://www.google.com/amp/s/www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/ncna1263146) article has been making its rounds on the internet. I am a NC citizen ,am currently 18 and if you look through my posts You can see I‚Äôve been through a lot recently. And this bill scares the living shit out of me I know that it is unlikely that it will pass through the governor but similar stuff has passed in other places and my life hasn‚Äôt exactly been going amazing this year. I want to spread awareness I want to scream at my teachers my classmates,coworkers,my social followers but I can‚Äôt to do so would make me not just a social pariah but would also make me an active target for violence in my community. I‚Äôm just fucking scared that all my effort to come out to try and keep going will be pointless . I‚Äôm honestly certain that if this bill passes through every checkpoint and becomes a law I will not be able to live any longer.

Edit: grammar"	"This kinda stuff pisses me off to no end

If I were to speak from the perspective of a cis het white man (which may not be true, but hypothetically) politicians attempting to block and demonize trans people for being themselves are complete morons. Like, what harm can it cause? Are you so clingy to your own views that anyone who isn't exactly like you is just the scum of the earth? I can sorta understand limits on surgeries before adulthood (even then someone's will to live is probably more important than the risks coming with it) but blockers and hormones should stay open without a question.

I'm glad that someone in a high enough position of power has the common sense to veto laws like this, but the fact that those people exist and may just get their way one time sucks beyond belief.
Sweetie, I'm scared right along with you. As a fellow NC resident, I also feel the hatred and discrimination closing in around me. I am in my 40's and I'm also an educator. I am not out professionally and feel like if I speak out to advocate for myself and others like you then I have outed myself and put myself, my family, and my career in jeopardy. You are right that this will never pass through Gov. Cooper, but still, it's disheartening that we have representatives that are there to represent everyone, but instead choose to treat some as ""the others"" out of fear and a lack of knowledge and empathy. I applaud your bravery for being able to step out at your age and face the world. We are all scared at this point but we have to have faith that good will overcome.
We need to make the voice of our kind louder than its ever been they want to say we ""don't exist"" but you cant attack something if its not there. but mr politician then what is it that you acknowledge and try to smother out? In that act you mr politician knowingly are excluding entire groups of existing people because they don't share your ideals and are willing to risk their lives and health for the sake of what? Your own prejudice? The fact is they know what their doing is wrong and hurtful"	mo092b	trans	11	0.75	2021-04-10 07:29:52
Just one of those days.	"Normally the trans issues people are forcing to the main page for no other reason than to increase our chances of experiencing a hate crime and to get reelected dont phase me. I usually shrug off the hate and it wont stick to me. 
 
 Today was a mess though. I heard in passing on the news today in my state some kind of bill about trans sports come up and they branded it ‚ÄúSave Womens Sports‚Äù and that really sent a shock through me. Like what? 
 
They have to be absolutely certain to dissect trans women from women. Like just saying that is basically the same thing as saying you are not a woman. Needless to say it upset me greatly today.

 Well shortly after that i was upset and trying to get my hair together. I was trying to comb it and my comb snagged my eyebrow piercing and ripped it through to where the ball end was inside of my skin. 
 
So that was the tipping point for me, i looked at myself in the mirror and my hair was a mess and i had blood streaming down my face. I looked and felt like a monster so i broke down in tears‚Ä¶. And that was my day today‚Ä¶..i just wanted to tell somebody"	"You're not a monster. The amount of bills that have been created this year targeting trans individuals has been ridiculous this year. Coming from someone who had a very similar day, just do your best to keep your head up and take a deep breath when you can. Some days it can just all be a lot...

Missouri bill set to prohibit youth from receiving transgender medical care, and allows adults to be denied coverage for the same by insurance.	"https://house.mo.gov/Bill.aspx?bill=HB2649&year=2022&code=R

HB 2649 (Known as the ""Missouri Save Adolescents from
Experimentation (SAFE) Act"") is currently working it's way through the Missouri state legislature.

The bill specifies that, a physician or other health care
professional cannot provide gender transition procedures to any
individual under 18 years of age or refer the individual to any
health care professional for gender transition procedures.

The bill would also allow companies to deny coverage of transgender healthcare for adults.
